0	13160	My favorite headline this week involves the current arcade machine renaissance. Those
13160	16800	that want an actual cabinet can get them, those that want a fractional scale model but
16800	21880	visually identical version can, and innovators can do fun, unique things too. Like NBA Jam
21880	25920	Shack Edition. Despite only ever playing as the Chicago Bulls and NBA Jam, reading about
25920	30080	this still put a smile on my face. This is just one larger than life story. Now it's
30080	33440	time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the
33440	36720	rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
41840	47680	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. Another week of the show where
47680	54960	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number
55040	63520	903 of our show for tonight, February the 13th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined by
63520	70960	my co-hosts at the keyboard at the moment. Say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. Hi Loki,
70960	78160	how are you doing? It's somewhat pain but I'm okay. Oh no, all right I want to ask about that
78160	83760	but quickly I just want to say DarkSakura is here. She had a cooking mama emergency in the other
83760	89840	room. So don't worry, Sakura is fixing it right now with the cooking. She'll be right back. So
90720	97280	but the pre-show video thing ended. I was gonna let it go like another minute and I was like well
97280	102320	this is awkward. I guess I'll just start the show. The joys of being here live because of course we
102320	106880	do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the
106880	111920	Bobby Black Wolf show. Not tonight though. Bobby Black Wolf is enjoying seven layer bean dip with
111920	116880	friends tonight. Oh hello there's DarkSakura back from cooking mama emergency. Hey DarkSakura.
117520	125120	Hey. Hey did mama fix it? My couscous actually burned a little bit on my pot so since it was
125120	131520	a very expensive enamel dutch oven. I had to get that scrubbed real quick before I put it in the
131520	136320	in the dishwasher. Thankfully I can dish wash it. It's fine but I had to get the burnt couscous.
136320	142480	But for people on camera I have chicken and carrot and black truffle and onion
143120	147920	and couscous with my homemade broth and I've added cheese because that's what you do.
147920	149520	Did you bring enough for everyone?
151360	154800	You should see how much I have. I have two containers of it in the fridge. I mean I used
154800	161520	all my couscous thinking oh this will make a little bit no no it made it made a lot.
161520	167360	I would say I'm coming over but things are a little busy with my move going on right now so
167360	172720	I've been talking about it for oh go ahead. Well if you want something to eat like on
172720	178320	Thursday I'm sure there'll be some left because Dan won't won't eat the couscous. I made it all
178320	183280	for me so I'll bring you some couscous. I've been talking about it for a few weeks on the show but
183280	190000	I am moving so Bobby it's interesting Bobby's not here tonight because of friends and chips
190000	194960	and traditions and things like that. The Owl show. Yeah the Owl show is on well actually I
194960	198720	hear there was a really decent halftime show I didn't I didn't catch it but I heard it was
198720	203200	pretty good so um so I guess there's that there's that that's usually the way it is there's a really
203200	207440	cool concert that happens once a year and then there's this little football game that they play
207440	211680	before and after it so apparently the concert kind of lived up to it this year so. Who cares
211680	217600	about sports ball? I know some people do whatever I find it's more traditions for a lot of people
217600	224560	but anyway uh so Bobby's not here tonight we won't be here next week because uh I'm moving
224560	228480	uh and I've been talking about this for a few weeks on the show so technically this is the
228480	234160	last night in studio N7. I haven't taken down any of the decorations yet um that'll probably be
234160	240400	tomorrow um but uh yeah uh this this studio we've been using this probably for the last seven years
240400	244320	I think is about as long as I've lived here and so it's interesting because the studio space saw
244320	250960	the end of our run on shoutcast which was audio only and um saw the beginning of twitch
250960	256240	uh for video which is funny because this space wasn't really set up for twitch but we made it
256240	261120	work and uh here we are now taping virtually which is what we're going to continue to do
261120	267440	uh in two weeks when we come back uh with our next episode uh where my my setup will change
267440	271680	drastically from what you see tonight I'm not exactly sure what it will look like yet but I
271680	277280	will say that Alan and I got to go to the house and actually see everything this week and it was
277280	282080	it was really cool I'm getting more and more excited so uh very very cool um I do want to
282080	286480	welcome those of you in our chat room and and big uh thank you as I see the hype train going on in
286480	291520	chat right now thank you so much to all of our live folks that are that are here despite the
291520	296320	concert and game on tv right now uh you all are here and super appreciate that but of course if
296320	301680	you listen on our podcast feed uh we appreciate that as well uh I want to go back to Loki real
301680	305520	quick before we get into the kickoff topic because I didn't I didn't catch what's playing behind you
305520	311920	tonight it looks like a Zelda game but like a DS thing what's what is what is that which which game
311920	323200	is it I can't tell from this far back is that is it Minish Cap no no which one it's Spirit Tracks
323200	330080	oh okay all right what made you say I did Dr Hatta well because the the DS Zelda games are
330080	336160	awesome and they really should bring them to the switch um like I mean when we're talking about
336160	342320	like how like oh yes it would be completely ruined if we brought like a game that Nintendo made to
342320	350560	mobile like Mario um whereas I think actually Zelda would work very well because it worked
350560	358720	well in the DS it was mainly using the stylus and so I that is a possibility I still wouldn't
358720	362400	want to see them come to mobile just put them on the switch but like you know it would still be
362400	369280	kind of cool yeah um going to our chat uh over twitch.tv slash vog network pod culture says uh
369280	378000	ah no more live shows ever never say never never say never ever uh on that note uh yeah Loki
378000	382880	brought up Nintendo uh and Zelda so I think we should probably talk about the big surprise
383520	389600	never say never to a new Nintendo Direct because once again we had no idea it was coming and then
389600	394480	you know in the middle of the week they said bam you're gonna get a new Nintendo Direct tomorrow
394480	399280	and uh it happened and I gotta say we'll recap everything they talked about but I've gotta say
399280	404720	um I couldn't watch it live which was a bummer um I just had work obligations which you know work is
404720	410320	more important um so I had to take care of that and then I was gonna watch it like on stream
410320	416560	delayed to get reactions but um I got twit or uh twitter notifications pushed to my phone that kind
416560	422960	of spoiled the big news uh so I was like all right I guess I'll just read up on it so I admittedly I
422960	428480	never watched the Nintendo Direct I just saw the bullet points but it still sounded like it was
428480	433920	a pretty action-packed good direct uh for all things considered it was I saw some folks online
433920	438560	that were very meh about it which kind of surprised me I thought there was a lot of good
438560	443520	stuff in it um but let's let's talk about some of the big headlines that were in the direct uh do
443520	448960	you have it up Loki you want me to talk about it yeah so it was it was all right I mean there was
448960	453760	some big announcements I guess there's a lot of games I just don't play the series of so it's not
453760	460000	like you know I was super hyped about things but you know overall they had some stuff I'm interested
460000	466400	in yeah there's lots of like interesting things on there like Chrono Cross yeah that's it's
466400	470400	interesting to see that and there's the Tel Aviv stuff that they have for that as well which is
470400	476240	kind of neat um you know that one was rumored you know for all the crap we get about reporting on
476240	481280	rumors sometimes that Chrono Cross I remember was a thing like four weeks ago because we were
481280	485360	wondering why are they doing Chrono Cross and they won't touch Chrono Trigger I remember that
485360	491120	discussion coming up a few weeks ago on the show um so uh it does seem like those Square Enix
491120	496800	remasters of like Secret of Mana you know and so forth are bringing fruit although I guess Chrono
496800	503120	Cross is not really a remaster it's just kind of repackaged for the Switch I suppose and I would
503120	509520	bet mobile I don't think they're gonna only have it on the Switch it's gotta be for mobile as well
509520	516720	because that's been Square's mo lately so yeah so they um showed off a Fire Emblem Three Houses
516720	524560	um Musou game so they've got Fire Emblem uh Warriors I guess or three yeah Fire Emblem
524560	530160	Warriors Three Hopes so I believe that's the sequel to the last game that they had come out
530160	536480	I feel like those Warriors games do pretty well on the Switch like you know obviously the um Hyrule
536480	542960	Warriors you know has done very well on the Switch there's the Persona one I'm just so sick
542960	549520	of Fire Emblem but you know some people like it so it's fine well I think what's it's gonna be
549520	556000	a completely different style for Fire Emblem too so you know I think I think it it works for the
556000	564320	Musou type of you know game so I think it'll be fun um what else so uh No Man's Sky is coming to
564320	569120	the Switch that's pretty interesting to see that actually happening I've been asked about my
569120	573280	thoughts on this one because I'm kind of the resident No Man's Sky fanboy a little bit um
573280	578400	and uh I mean it's I'm I'm all for more people getting exposed to the game and there are people
578400	583440	that will get to play it on Switch who haven't played it on other platforms yet um and I know
583440	589600	a lot of the concern is is it gonna run on the Switch it'll run on the Switch I mean it runs on
589600	596240	an OG Playstation 4 and an OG Xbox One it doesn't run very well um I would imagine they're gonna be
596240	600880	targeting a lower resolution especially when the game is handheld um so they'll probably be able
600880	606800	to do some things but I I I it's not gonna be ideal I don't think it's gonna be the ideal way
606800	613840	to play No Man's Sky unless your gaming is largely portable if you take transit a lot or you know you
613840	618720	just happen to play Switch in portable mode then hey having the No Man's Sky experience portable
618720	623600	will be kind of nice but I I don't think it'll be the optimal way to play it but I'm all for
623600	628560	more people um coming on board and I hope it retains the cross-play functionality
628560	637440	um because it'll be one of those few games uh that play across Sony, PC, Microsoft and Switch
637440	643920	so it'd be be pretty cool um we have a new Mario Strikers game so that's Mario Strikers
643920	649200	Battle League that's coming out in June 10th which looked kind of cool um those are that's
649200	653520	the series I don't really care about but cool yeah as we mentioned uh Chrome of Cross the
653520	663280	remasters coming to Switch on April 7th um there was the announcement of Mother and Earthbound
663280	669760	being added to Nintendo Switch online so for the NES and SNES finally I'm alive
670640	678720	makes me happy yeah Live Alive that's getting uh ported and remastered on the Switch uh which is
678720	684880	pretty awesome and I have like voice acting in there and stuff I'm just gonna say Live Alive
684880	692000	I think was the biggest and best news in the entire Direct. I'm gonna say why I think the
692000	698400	Live Alive was the biggest and best news it's because unlike the Chrono Cross one and some
698400	704720	of the other things we've seen Square Enix do and I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of toot on something
704720	713680	I said months ago on this show we're seeing Square leverage that um Octopath Traveler
713680	720080	slash Triangle Strategy Engine for something really different now and I remember I remember
720080	724560	when I brought this up it was when I was reviewing that game Dungeon Encounters remember when that
724560	728800	came out um a couple months it was by the uh minds behind Final Fantasy 12 kind of created
728800	734560	this very minimalistic RPG um and some people are super into it and I I just I liked it but
734560	739040	I didn't understand why it had to be minimalistic and I said they've got this engine why aren't they
739040	743360	using this engine to build more things and that kind of went into the talk about what if the
743360	748800	Final Fantasy remasters ended up in this engine or something like that you met right but well
749360	756000	it's not Final Fantasy remaster but I feel like it's something adjacent is now going into this
756000	763280	engine and I think that's really exciting um and I you know between that and the Chrono Cross news
763280	768720	I think we should all cross our fingers cross our toes hold our breath that that's why Chrono
768720	773760	Trigger is taking so long that Chrono Trigger is going to like maybe Live Alive is like a test
773760	778000	to kind of port these sorts of games over and maybe Chrono Trigger is going to get the Triangle
778000	784080	Strategy Octopath treatment um you know I know it's a it's a wild theory but I just think that
784080	788960	that was the most exciting news I think out of the whole direct I I it's interesting I know people
788960	795040	that really love that game um I I must admit I I know of it I don't I'm not very familiar with it
795040	799840	so it is you know especially for those of us in this you know in the states and you know North
799840	805120	America who have never uh really experienced that before except through a translated ROM it's almost
805120	810320	like it's a new product of sorts but I I think you know it's it's neat that Square is digging
810320	815920	into the vaults meanwhile Nintendo kind of does the bare minimum of finally putting their Earthbound
815920	820480	ROMs up on the service don't get me wrong I'm happy I'm thrilled for that that's great but of
820480	826800	course we're all sitting here going Mother 3 when and everyone's like and they're like nope and even
826800	831840	the Earthbound creator was out there on Twitter going I didn't know this was going to happen I'm
831840	836240	really happy that folks are getting to play this yeah I'd love to see Earthbound 3 happen too
836240	840800	you know is in this and then of course I'm sure Reggie was fucking teasing Earthbound 3 as always
840800	847200	or Mother 3 excuse me as always so it's just silly I'm glad I'm glad the um I'm glad the games
847200	850960	are finally where they need to be I'm glad they didn't put it on the plus version of the service
850960	858480	or anything stupid like that and I'm really glad about Live Alive yeah um some other announcements
858480	863040	that they had so they have um some collections coming to the Switch they're getting ported over
863040	868400	so there's a portal companion collection which is portal one and two uh there's also the Klonoa
868400	874320	series that's getting ported over as well uh front mission first is a remake of the first front
874320	879120	mission game that's going to be coming out on the Switch as well uh they showed off a trailer for
879120	886320	the salmon run next wave which is part of Splatoon 3 uh what else oh and Splatoon 3 is this summer
886320	892240	I didn't know I didn't expect we'd get it that fast to be honest yeah this summer um they showed
892240	898960	off a new trailer for Kirby and the forgotten land um so that looked funny with the uh mouthful mode
899760	906320	and what else a new trailer for triangle strategy uh which is kind of less exciting after the Live
906320	912800	Alive announcement then um some of the bigger stuff so now we're getting a Wii sports kind of
912800	919280	sequel with Nintendo Switch Sports which I could have done without their demonstration of
919280	927040	volleyball but um cool well this is that game where it's like of course like this is what we
927040	931760	should have had at the beginning instead of one two switch and it's kind of surprising you know
931760	937040	especially with how huge Wii Sports was and you know and in my brain I went boy they really should
937040	944160	have done this for the Wii U and I neglect oh they did oops but the Wii U kind of fizzled out
944160	949840	that fast I completely forgot and I think most people did let's be real so it's it I mean this
949840	955280	is one of Nintendo's biggest titles it's weird to think about but it is so it's nice that Nintendo
955280	959440	Switch is finally like getting its due with and it's one of those things where it's like oh of
959440	964160	course they had to announce this someday like this seems very logical that we'd get here at some
964160	968720	point I just really wanted to get some comments from chat real quick Mike Deft is talking about
968720	973840	Klonoa which I know Dark Sakura was excited about too and Mike Deft says yeah the Klonoa 1 is
973840	979680	running on the same base they used for the Wii remake but they're using the old models Klonoa 2
979680	984880	looks like a simple remaster which I'm fine with I'm so happy we got Klonoa again and Dark Sakura
984880	992000	I'm sure you echo that a little bit as well uh for getting Klonoa yeah um speaking of uh stuff
992000	996880	also being ported over I forgot about the uh Force Unleashed is being ported over from it's
996880	1001680	the Wii version that they're bringing to the Switch which looks it's really showing its age um
1002880	1007520	what else uh so other bigger announcements Xenoblade Chronicles 3 coming to the Switch
1007520	1013120	in September looks amazing another one of those oh of course this would happen at some point I
1013120	1017760	think for me I was more uh impressed with the speed I mean this is something I wouldn't have
1017760	1022640	expected for a couple years but um actually it came up in Discord I uh I shared that comment
1022640	1027600	over on our Discord over at vognetwork.com discord I was kind of talking about that and somebody
1027600	1032720	did say you know the the chatter is that they actually started two and three around the same
1032720	1037440	time um kind of knowing they were gonna make a trilogy the whole time so this has just been sort
1037440	1044000	of um you know finished up after two released basically so we got the news that there's probably
1044000	1049680	not going to be a new Mario Kart 9 until at least 2024 that's because Mario Kart 8 is getting more
1049680	1057680	DLC 48 new tracks that have been ported over from a remastered I guess from other Mario Kart games
1057680	1064480	including Mario Kart Tour which is the mobile game so those are going to be coming this year
1064480	1072160	and in next year and it's like $25 for the DLC and of course they're throwing that into the
1072160	1079360	expansion pass as well but smart um not a bad deal for 48 tracks over the course of you know
1080000	1086640	few years but yeah I also I see it as them trying to sweeten the pot with their expansion pass
1086640	1092560	I think I think they're overcharging for what it is quite honestly especially with no new characters
1092560	1097120	I think they're really trying to push people to that pass because now yeah they've got that
1097120	1101920	they've got of course the Genesis and you know that the Nintendo 64 stuff and then they got the
1101920	1106160	Animal Crossing right so I think they're really trying to push yeah why can't they do more
1106160	1110480	characters like that I'm surprised that they're not doing that I don't know you know have you seen
1110480	1115840	a lot of the um you know discourse about that the tracks didn't look great in the preview some folks
1115840	1120000	thought they were kind of playing well they were like this they were at least the one example they
1120000	1123840	were showing like they completely changed the way it looks and it looks a lot more simpler
1124560	1130720	from you know it's not as nice looking as even the mobile version which I'm kind of surprised
1130720	1135440	well I mean to some extent like I understand a map like what Chaco Mountain was on there right
1135440	1140000	from the N64 I think that we saw caught a glimpse of that it looked all right yeah but I mean but if
1140000	1145040	you think about it the N64 that's the problem when you kind of upskill a lot of those old maps they
1145040	1149680	were playing because the N64 could only handle so much I don't think they were necessarily referring
1149680	1154800	to the Nintendo 64 stuff I think they're talking about the Mario Kart Tour maps um being kind of
1154800	1160320	like downscaled almost um I think the stuff the retro tracks are obviously going to look better
1160400	1165360	because they're based off older versions of the game and they have a lot more room to add detail
1165360	1170800	and stuff to it so it'll make it look nicer but when you take something from Mario Kart Tour which
1170800	1175120	is probably running I don't really know how well the mobile game runs or what the hardware
1175120	1180800	requirements are for that but like you know it probably has some better fidelity to it and a
1180800	1185440	little bit more detail in the models and stuff in the tracks and so they're probably not able to
1185440	1190560	pull that down into the switch and maintain a good frame rate so they're obviously going to
1190560	1196720	make some you know alterations that kind of do that and we're talking about like what it looks
1196720	1204160	like based off of an early shot that you know who knows when this is coming out and it's just like
1204160	1210720	a few second clips so it's very subjective right now um I think it's interesting though
1210720	1215360	especially with all the rumors about Mario Kart 9 which obviously I mean it could have been people
1216000	1222960	switch I agree HD yeah it's it'll be a launch title yeah Mario the next Mario Kart is going
1222960	1228160	to be for whatever Nintendo's successor to the Switch is it's going to be the next console I
1228160	1233840	think at this point Mario Kart 8 is kind of like the full life of the Switch and uh I think Mario
1233840	1238160	Kart 8 again and we'll just make Mario Kart infinity we'll turn the eight sideways you know
1238160	1244080	well honestly I think we'd all love a Mario Kart game that just encompasses every single track
1244080	1248880	right take the Smash Brothers get in there how many how many tracks are left take the Smash
1248880	1254240	Smash Brothers approach everyone is here right every character and every track from a prior game
1254240	1258800	why not seriously think about that because like if you look at it you know a lot of the tracks
1258800	1262720	in some of the other games I don't remember when they started recycling tracks a little
1262720	1268240	maybe that's DS um but like there's a lot of the other games have just tracks from other
1268240	1274800	titles in there like I can't imagine that we're left with many unique tracks from you know
1275840	1282880	just in general and also why can't they just make new tracks you know well did they say every track
1282880	1288160	was recycled or are people in every track because no it's what they said I thought there was still
1288160	1293280	room for new tracks interesting I mean they still could put more DLC out there I think that they
1293280	1297600	should put the pass out for the tracks and maybe have like some additional characters or something
1297600	1303040	that they should throw in there like I don't know I would have thought that maybe since Mario Kart
1303040	1307600	Tour kind of ended up fizzling maybe there were some planned things for that that they would push
1307600	1312480	over that's where I thought they might squeeze some new tracks from but I guess not interesting
1313520	1321280	all right anything else um no that's I think it I'm trying to think back if there's any other
1321280	1326320	announcements that they kind of showed off there was like some updates for Metroid Dread that's
1326320	1330480	going to be coming out so they have a few different difficulty modes basically a one hit
1330480	1336560	kill one hit death mode that's going to be a dread mode that's coming out soon and then also they're
1336560	1341040	having an easier mode that's in there as well and then they're going to be adding later on a boss
1341040	1345680	rush mode that's going to be coming I'm glad to hear that Metroid's getting a Bobby Black Wolf
1345680	1350320	mode that's great yeah yeah and then they showed off a new trailer for Advance Wars 1 and 2
1351120	1358480	reboot camp that's coming out on April 8th the only thing I wanted to comment on that I didn't
1358480	1364320	catch was the portal so they're doing like portal 2 on the switch basically I thought it was portal
1364320	1370000	one and two is a one and two well yeah it sounds like kind of a repackaging of the games which
1370000	1374320	you know those I mean don't get me wrong I love portal I love that series it's cool that it's
1374320	1379280	portable but it's also like who hasn't played it at this point but you know what would be neat
1379280	1387200	about it and I didn't see this to the point but there were also those fan released level edits
1387200	1394480	that I thought they went back and put on steam and it would be nice if the switch version included
1394480	1399760	those well what struck me as odd is that you know of course there's that whole like yay let's get
1399760	1407680	uh portal portable but we have the steam deck so it seems weird that valve is lending portal over
1407680	1413600	to the Nintendo switch when I don't think so I mean but portal would still be a great reason to
1413600	1418720	get a steam deck it's just interesting that valve is doing that that's all portal portal is old no
1418720	1424240	one's going to get a steam deck for portal yeah true I guess there's that I mean on top of that
1424240	1431920	how many different versions of the orange box do they put out and you know I I it should have been
1431920	1438160	the orange box well portal portal 2 has been released on everything and then they've had all
1438160	1443040	the the edits and everything portal 2 right now is old enough that it's not going to be a steam
1443040	1449600	deck seller what would be a steam deck seller is being able to have you know some of the current
1449600	1455600	biggest games that will work on the steam deck from multiple publishers that's what's going to
1455600	1463600	sell a steam deck or for people you know like me who uh doesn't have exactly a pc capable you know
1463600	1468800	system although I've worked around it and I don't need a steam deck now but that's what's going to
1468800	1473920	sell a steam deck um I don't think portal 2 is is remotely going to be in the ballpark of it
1473920	1479760	sorry interesting pod culture and chat says well I and to to be clear I'm not exactly saying like
1479760	1483920	oh god people are getting steam decks just for portal but I just think it's interesting
1483920	1490880	that valve is giving an exclusive to nintendo at this same time that they have a console
1490880	1495120	now that they're putting out basically that could benefit from all sorts of exclusives
1495120	1500560	so additional sales it's not even really I mean it's like it's it's a game that came out on the
1500560	1507440	xbox 360 you know that several years ago yeah I I'm not sure there's a huge audience for this to
1507440	1512560	begin with except for the fact that I and I think this is the reality too and something we all have
1512560	1518880	to kind of just is that there are going to be kids out there that were eight when portal two
1518880	1524400	first came out that are now approaching 20 uh that maybe are going to be playing these games
1524400	1529040	for the first time because they were a little young for it the first time I think there's
1529040	1534560	I think that's where the audience for these games are quite honestly as shona matt says don't say
1534560	1541520	that rob sorry I it is what it is I really think that's where the audience is um pod culture says
1541520	1547920	portal three would be a steam deck seller now that would that would be too easy for valve to do
1547920	1552480	but it wouldn't be just on steam though it would be on and we know that they can't count to three
1552480	1557200	anyway well that is true how long did it take capcom to learn how to count to three
1558320	1564000	a long time but yes steam deck is not isolated in its own world but still even just the fact
1564000	1570160	that portal three you know all these years later is still not a thing is interesting to me but it
1570160	1577360	is what it is valve has their plan I guess so all right well I I thought it was a very solid
1577360	1582080	nintendo direct at the end of the day um a lot of good announcements I thought there was some
1582080	1587520	really good surprises in there especially the live alive and you know chrono cross and just
1587520	1592880	clano a lot of good stuff coming back and a lot of um you know forward-looking stuff I think the
1592880	1598480	mario kart tracks was kind of a surprise um splatoon 3 not being holiday but paying for
1598480	1604720	their service I mean like I know it I know it's like kind of stupid just to buy it outright but
1604720	1609280	I'm going to buy it out right I'm not supporting that expansion pass service yeah I'm I'm still on
1609280	1613520	the fence I mean honestly I'm not playing enough mario kart 8 I'm not sure I would even get the
1613520	1620640	tracks it's I'm on I'm on jds plan so I spent so little on it anyway that it doesn't matter
1620640	1625200	there you go all right well let's talk about the types of things that we are playing this
1625200	1630400	week nintendo switch or otherwise in how was your gaming week so uh we'll start with dark
1630400	1635920	sakura how was your gaming week what do you been playing this week I played stuff um of course dead
1635920	1642560	by daylight um they've disabled nurse which is kind of uh weird for me because I said after rank
1642560	1650160	reset which is what today yesterday today yeah that my plan was to go back and practice nurse
1650160	1656880	a lot more um although what I'm also doing is uh I've got my first p350 which is freddy
1657680	1665440	oh congrats um and I finally decided to prestige pig um so now I am doing nothing but putting all
1665440	1672160	of my points on um in in uh miss pigu so that I can uh uh make her my second p350
1673360	1678880	and for those who don't know um every time you hit 50 you can prestige but you can only
1678880	1684560	prestige three times and then you get another achievement when you hit 50 on prestige level
1684560	1689280	three I've also figured out how to rip the models from dead by daylight now and import them into
1689280	1696400	blender I saw you tweeting some of this stuff it was interesting yeah they actually redid pig's
1696400	1703520	face when they put out the new cosmetics so before that um her face was just sort of like almost kind
1703520	1711120	of flat and now um she actually like like for the the head actually goes with that outfit that I
1711120	1716720	have on her there's a different head for the mask uh you know the mask with the bear trap crown
1716720	1721840	right uh mask the bear trap crown has like a sort of a shaded kind of like under the batman mask
1721840	1728400	sort of makeup thing her regular face is all covered in blood um which she didn't even get
1728400	1732160	that bloody in the real movies hell even when she got shot in the neck she didn't get that bloody
1732640	1739760	um so uh I I thought it was really really interesting um I still haven't figured out how
1739760	1745760	to get the the skeletons imported right so that I can use some other animation stuff but really
1745760	1752800	my goal is just a converter to a uh a v tube thing anyway um and I'm going to be trying to edit the
1752800	1759280	the face mesh to uh to look a little bit more realistic I'm going to stylize it quite a bit
1759280	1765040	but right now I've got my first work done and I'm also going to rip uh a meg in the pig mask
1765040	1773200	so I don't have to animate her face interesting okay so um actually I tried to apply Jill's face
1773200	1782960	to to pig and the survivor's heads are a little bit smaller so um the eye holes are like here
1783680	1788400	like right where normal eyes are and then like the actual eyeballs just so you know oh is it
1788400	1794800	yeah oh crap okay sorry so the eyes would be like right here um you know we're normal the eye holes
1794800	1799520	would be there but like the eyeballs themselves since the eyeballs are part of the face mesh
1800160	1806080	are like under uh like where the cheekbone would be whereas you know amandas are like right in the
1806080	1812640	right place so I kind of need to figure out how to I haven't done mesh editing except for like
1812640	1818080	v tube studio which is really simple so this is going to be a test of my skills so wish me luck
1818960	1827040	but my eventual goal is to get Jill's face um applied over amanda's uh uh mask
1828000	1835280	so that at least it's a decent looking face so anyway um and going I also need to double check
1835280	1840240	what uh what eye color Shawnee had the I forgot her last name but she was the actress that played
1840240	1846560	Amanda and Saul so I need to look up her eye color and make sure that there's the right one so anyway
1846560	1851360	um going though to other games I've been playing of course I did Fantasian which I have Fantasian
1851360	1859920	Friday and uh I had to restart on a couple of things um and I also started doing a retro stream
1859920	1866240	on Saturday night after work and I played The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past and I have
1866240	1872000	lost a lot of skills in that game because I haven't played it in 10 years so and he was like oh where
1872000	1875200	was this shit where was that shit do I get this or no I can't get the Zora thing because I need to
1875200	1881760	get the glove and so I'm on to getting the glove although I finished the first palace um I always
1881760	1888160	never know what to call what was his name like Sahasrallah the the old man so I call him
1888160	1895840	Sarsaparilla that works I call him Scheherazade once but Dan and I do that is like if we find
1895840	1899920	someone with a kind of a complicated name even though we can pronounce it we still kind of screw
1899920	1908960	it up um and then uh I actually have a translated copy of Live Alive that I intended to start
1909680	1921200	until the direct came out um the timing so right um and I also uh played Radiant Silver Gun
1921200	1930560	for Saturn fun on my Mac oh fun yeah I um I've managed to get PC Engine and Saturn games
1930560	1936400	and I think I might be able to get a Playstation 1 to work next I'm still trying to find Robit
1936400	1943440	Lundu which I would prefer to have an original of mine but you know I'll play it any way I can
1943440	1949440	games like older than some people I know um and then of course you know I played wordscapes
1949440	1957920	because that's what I do and just yeah watching friends play stuff trying to see what's interesting
1957920	1963840	you know some people are playing that Lost Ark I can't play it so oh and of course Mass Effect 2
1963840	1971440	which I was able to get running in my uh my parallels oh fun so I also got my uh my
1971440	1978080	SteelSeries controller working yay my old one my Nimbus I'm sad I missed your um retro stream I was
1978480	1983280	hosting like my gaming week is a little thin because I was hosting um show shows are starting
1983280	1988560	to come back um with precautions but I was hosting uh last night or yeah last night was
1988560	1992800	Rocky Horror and then two nights ago was a burlesque variety thing so I was very busy
1993440	1997920	out doing that but I know why you uh messaged me that you were gonna do it I was like oh darn
1997920	2001200	uh I would have watched while I was packing boxes if I wasn't out and about so
2002000	2005520	well I'm kind of getting to the point where I'm just gonna throw up the cheats on it just because
2005520	2010160	really I'm playing it for the experience of playing the game and yeah I don't care I I'm
2010160	2016480	at least using the save states because you know when you die you start over and there's one battle
2016480	2021200	that even when I was super good at the game still always gave me problems and that was that big
2021200	2028320	stupid giant worm that's in the second is in the second or third yeah yeah I hate that thing um
2029280	2035440	and uh I don't even know what it was but I always would just like it would take me for like even
2036240	2043440	the newer one the link between worlds that gave me fits too it was a pain in the ass yeah so
2043440	2049840	I'm just like I'm just cheat to win I don't care I'm playing for the story it doesn't matter I'm
2049840	2055760	the one playing the game if anyone has a problem with it fuck you all right I'm the one playing
2055760	2060640	the game and you're not you don't you don't know anyone you play you play the way you want on your
2060640	2065040	stream and that's they don't like it they go somewhere else it's just been like lately I've
2065040	2070320	seen a slew of people like complaining about how people are enjoying things I'm like it's not
2070320	2079520	hurting you yeah fuck off seriously I I I am like right now at the point where I'm just like I don't
2079520	2085680	give a shit I'm the one playing it you can deal with it there you go all right let's go over to
2085680	2094320	loki how was your gaming week um so it's minecraft um but it's also I finished playing well as of
2094320	2098880	right now because they're constantly updating the game but I have completed the entire game
2099600	2108000	of power wash simulator oh wow things have been power washed now congrats so yeah that that was
2108000	2115040	fun um but now yeah I wish there's more to do in there um and then minecraft have been extremely
2115040	2122000	busy the last week or so so I was working on a sorting system and storage system so that was
2122000	2128240	kind of this entire week and I'm putting together my new episode well I started it this morning so
2128240	2136320	I should be hopefully out in the next couple days all right um that's it my gaming week as I
2136320	2139920	mentioned was a little bit slower just with all the other commitments going on I did still play
2139920	2145840	way too much dead by daylight um I got my adept Claudette achievement today so yay yay I got fanged
2145840	2149920	to level 10 so I'm gonna get hers next so just kind of working my way through those for no
2149920	2154800	particular reason it's just a fun I need you to still help me with my Michaela adapt yeah sure
2154800	2160720	just um but I don't want to lose my 100% survival rate uh well then don't play with me because I
2160720	2166160	have had some sweaty ass I had a basement bubba today I haven't seen that gag in like six months
2166160	2171200	and I just forget how exhausting that is to like go down there and rescue someone in the basement
2171200	2178960	and then and it's like oh fucking really I have to tell you I thought of a way to do um a uh like a
2180640	2187600	you know basement uh pig but I was gonna call it um like a pantry pig and I decided instead
2187600	2194960	to call it basement bacon okay so more on that later all right um and then I've still been
2194960	2200160	playing Final Fantasy 14 been pretty much capping my red tomes every week and working on my gear
2200160	2204160	for my gunbreaker which is kind of my main class class that I play in that game uh and then
2204160	2209600	otherwise playing gps games um ingress started their second sunday mission thing officially
2209600	2212960	they've been kind of doing it unofficially for a few months now and now the official one started
2212960	2217760	this month today with the new badge so you know the the walking incentive stuff has been really
2217760	2221760	good um I guess I haven't really mentioned this on olr I've talked about on social media but you
2221760	2226880	know I've talked about some of my health issues um over the past few months um I'm down over 30
2226880	2230960	pounds at this point um with all the changes that I've made since that happened and you know
2230960	2236640	honestly awesome the gp I mean obviously I've been working very hard with you know diet and all that
2236640	2243840	stuff too but the gps games Pikmin um ingress pokemon go which I actually picked up again which
2243840	2249920	I hadn't played in a while those have been huge in like gamifying steps so that I actually get more
2249920	2256080	steps every day so that I really push myself to go out on a walk and things like that is uh very
2256080	2261280	uh very big thank you I see the kind words in chat yeah it's funny um somebody came up to me
2261280	2267200	after a rocky last night and was like oh yeah you you look great I saw you in October and yeah I
2267200	2272160	could tell that you'd put on COVID weight you know I know it was well intentioned because she was
2272160	2277360	like we all have you know she's got that kind of thing uh and then she was like oh but you you're
2277360	2282240	looking great and it's it's nice it's a very nice thing um and I didn't I didn't want to tell her
2282240	2289440	like well I got diagnosed with diabetes and it really whips your ass into gear but we do also
2289440	2298160	need to stop uh you know what's the word I'm thinking of equivocating um size with with
2298160	2302000	aesthetics right and the person I was sitting with who kind of listened all that because I
2302000	2306720	kind of actually leaned in their ear and I said I should have said I should it's a good thing I
2306720	2312000	didn't say oh I got you know the type 2 diabetes will do that to you um and then my friend actually
2312000	2316080	said this is why I don't comment on people's bodies because you don't know people's stories
2316080	2321760	you know and I that's that's kind of my approach too I don't I'm always I'm always afraid I'm
2321760	2326400	going to say something like oh you've lost weight and then shock they gained it and I'm just an
2326400	2330560	idiot you know so I just try not to comment on that sort of thing at all unless some somebody
2330560	2335920	else tells me first oh I've lost weight or oh I'm trying to put on weight for whatever it's like oh
2335920	2340720	congrats are you meeting your goals okay cool good for you I like to tell tell people that
2340720	2346640	they're looking healthy yeah exactly you know not necessarily whether or not they've lost weight but
2346640	2351200	if I see that they've got a glow to their skin and they're energetic like oh you're looking really
2351200	2357360	healthy today yeah there you go you know because that is completely independent now if they happen
2357360	2362160	to have lost weight in order to improve their health then that ties in with it happy for them I
2362160	2366960	mean I'll be honest I was feeling a little bit shallow when I lost all that weight with my
2366960	2378560	surgery but you know it's size isn't a judge of health totally agree and I you know I it's one
2378560	2383280	of those things where weight loss is a very nice side effect of all this other bullshit and that's
2383280	2387760	kind of just how I've explained it is that you know I'll take it this is far said if I'm gonna
2387760	2394560	work hard sure I'll take weight loss why not it's fun all right anyhow let's move on we're gonna
2394560	2398800	get into some other news of course I've mentioned this a few times I just want to make sure y'all
2398800	2404080	know there will be no new OLR next week I know it's kind of a random week to not have a show
2404080	2410080	but it is because the move so we'll be back in two weeks so that means no podcasts no live show
2410800	2415120	but Bobby Blackwolf will be here so for the Sunday night loyal crowd over at twitch.tv
2415120	2419760	slash vog network you will have something to watch next week and for those who on the podcast
2419760	2427200	feed there is a huge library of back episodes available over at orange launch radio.com or
2427200	2432480	vog network under orange launch radio if you want to listen to an oldie moldy episode of
2432480	2437680	OLR to pass the time next week all right let's get into some news and let's talk about a game
2437680	2444160	that a lot of people have been playing this week and I wish I had had time to download it install
2444160	2449760	it play it myself but I said I'm gonna wait till after this moving stuff to get sucked into this
2449760	2458640	so Loki tell us about this yeah so the new uh I guess new for us MMO lost arc has reached a record
2458640	2468560	number of players on steam with 1.3 million online at peak and that is the third most game or played
2468560	2477280	game in the history based off active concurrent players um just not bad not bad at all um and
2477280	2484400	then of course I guess also well I actually now as of when we're looking at this I think it even beat
2484400	2496160	out um csgo because csgo had their record was uh 1.3 it was like 1 million 308 000 and I think now
2496160	2504960	they're just past that as well so uh pub g's through the roof right because you know when pub
2504960	2510240	g yeah like g's like 3.2 million three fortnight there were a ton of people playing uh pub g so
2510240	2517840	yeah so uh not those numbers anymore but yeah at its heyday it was you know pretty high up there so
2517840	2524960	um that's pretty great for a brand new mmo for lisa the us and europe I know this came out
2524960	2531760	originally in south korea in 2019 but um yeah it looks pretty cool well you know it's um I can't
2531760	2538240	take myself into an mmo at this point it's it's free to play which is you know that's a huge part
2538240	2544080	of why a lot of people are able to get into it um amazon has been doing a huge push through twitch
2544080	2549040	you know you probably saw an ad for lost ark before you got here on olr tonight um because
2549040	2553440	you know well that and that's smart that's amazon leveraging you know the fact that they run twitch
2553440	2557440	to put in some ads and you know get the hype going for this game which also seemed to work
2557440	2563200	well for new world uh you know even the new world kind of went like I feel like new world was very
2563200	2568560	much a flash in the pan so that I know it sounds really harsh but like honestly like it came and
2568560	2573680	went like sorry to fans of that game you know you don't need my validation to have fun with the game
2573680	2579040	but it just definitely seems like you know lost or new world was kind of you know the it girl for
2579040	2584160	like a weekend and then suddenly you know faded out real quick so I'm curious what the staying
2584160	2590080	power of this is gonna be if this ends up you know going ended up being a tide that comes in
2590080	2593760	really heavy and then recedes really quick or if this really does end up being something that
2593760	2597680	stays around and that's part of the reason I've been waiting a little bit to jump on board with
2597680	2603200	it I mean my personal life doesn't really give me the time right now to download fight queues and do
2603200	2609040	all that with something new um but you know if it's still relevant in a couple weeks and my
2609040	2615520	friends are still playing it uh I would definitely want to check it out um looking at some comments
2615520	2620560	from chat quest buster says launch was also delayed by several hours because of the demand
2620560	2625600	on the 11th but founders were able to get in a few days before that quest buster continuing uh who
2625600	2629920	also had commented that they've been playing a lot of it this week um it's a ton of fun but the first
2629920	2634720	few hours are a bit slow they tightened some of the experience up from what I had played from
2634720	2640560	the Russian version so it is also interesting that a game that's technically already existed
2640560	2646400	for quite some time yes in other parts of the world and other localizations it's interesting
2646400	2652880	that it's so popular and now I'm curious to see because of this what else is going to suddenly
2652880	2660720	show up that's been out for a long time in other places we'll see any interest in lost ark uh
2661840	2665520	I think dark soccer already said pass but loki did you you have any interest in lost
2665520	2672640	art no I I can't jump into it well I can't oh oh there's no uh mac even though yeah it's not
2672640	2679360	I don't think it runs on windows arm either oh bummer all right all right well moving on let's
2679360	2686160	talk about call of duty because of course with the pending purchase of microsoft to
2686720	2691920	buy activision blizzard a lot of people have been presuming that call of duty is going to end up an
2691920	2695840	exclusive and it certainly would make a lot of sense that it would go that direction however
2696800	2702160	this is very interesting the president of microsoft brad smith made a blog post saying
2702160	2707120	microsoft will continue to make call of duty and other popular activision blizzard titles available
2707120	2713040	on playstation through the term of any existing agreement with activision and we have committed
2713040	2718480	to sony that we will also make them available on playstation beyond the existing agreement
2718480	2723840	and into the future so that sony fans can continue continue to enjoy the games they love
2723840	2728880	we are also interested in taking similar steps to support nintendo's successful platform
2728880	2733520	we believe this is the right thing for the industry uh for gamers and for our business
2734480	2739040	uh many folks that are a little more skeptical about these sorts of things and i don't blame them
2739040	2744720	thinking that this might be microsoft's way to sort of respond to the fact that the ftc is all
2744720	2751200	up in this business uh for the approval of the takeover and so forth so perhaps um sony or
2751200	2758400	excuse me microsoft committing to supporting sony platforms is um gonna help them get through this
2758400	2765280	i guess or what have you um now maybe i'm just being a jerk but i don't think i am i would still
2765280	2770240	be highly skeptical of all this not i call of duty will come out for playstation you know if
2770240	2776480	they said it they're gonna do it but it doesn't mean it's gonna be the version you want because
2776480	2784160	i think we're definitely gonna see the extra maps extra characters extra stuff is going to be the
2784160	2790160	definitive version will be the microsoft version the sony version will be an afterthought uh
2791120	2795440	as will honestly probably nintendo's um just because of the limitations of the platform
2795440	2798800	now of course in a couple years when we're talking about nintendo's successor platform
2799520	2806960	that's a different conversation but um i i i still think microsoft would be foolish to not
2806960	2814560	have call of duty be the must play experience on their own platform and will sony do the same
2814560	2820080	thing with destiny and whatever bungee has cooking for the future abso-fucking-lutely
2820080	2825040	abso-fucking-lutely and of course microsoft also gets call of duty on game pass which is going to
2825040	2831040	be huge and they can continue to charge 60 bucks on playstation at launch i think a lot of it is
2831040	2839120	just that illusion of supporting everything equally um and i'm not so sure it really is
2840000	2843120	but i guess that's nice for people that never ever want to get a
2844640	2851600	xbox or play on their pc i suppose so all right let's move on dark sakura
2855840	2860960	i had to unmute my my mic every time i click it it actually immediately remutes itself is so weird
2861440	2869200	any rate um i remember going to e3 and always finding like the america's army area and they
2869200	2875360	were like always like oh play play this you'll see you know and then and then sign up for for
2875360	2883440	the rest of your life um well they and honestly it was a really revolutionary idea to use a video
2883440	2892080	game as a recruitment tool 20 years ago um now though they have uh uh you know it's free to play
2892080	2897600	it was really successful a lot of people said it was really fun but as of may 5th this year they
2897600	2907440	are going to shut down the servers and uh it's going to be retired so uh it i mean the the thing
2907440	2913040	with this particular with this particular game and and something like it is that it really was
2913040	2918960	a novel concept when it came out you know yeah we all knew oh this is a recruitment tool but
2918960	2926000	it also was supposedly a really good game i mean right and i mean we had so many different you
2926000	2931200	know military related games come out over the years but you know america's army was only supposed
2931200	2940640	to last for seven years but it was so successful that they uh actually the pentagon approved
2940640	2947440	spending more than three million a year to uh to promote the game and expand upon it
2947440	2953040	um i mean and right now the uh their recruiting budget i think is like eight billion
2954400	2959520	so that's not i mean that's only a small percentage of their recruiting budget but still
2959520	2965440	it is a big chunk of change um and then they said you know there was a study in 2008 from
2965440	2971680	uh the massachusetts institute of technology so mit um that said that thirty percent of all
2971680	2977760	americans ages 16 to 24 had a more positive impression of the army because of the game
2977760	2984720	and the game had a large impact on recruiting so it was clearly successful i mean the army has a
2984720	2990160	twitch channel well yes i know about that but that that hasn't always been good news because
2990160	2994800	that was the one where people were going in there and asking about war crimes and so they would get
2994800	2998480	banned but then it was like well the government can't ban people it's freedom of speech right so
2998480	3003360	it started that whole interesting conversation and how there are protocols on that but um going
3003360	3008320	back to the game itself yeah i mean i've i've heard i've i've no interest in the game i'm not
3008320	3012400	going to play it or or really cover it on this show beyond these um interesting pop culture
3012880	3020640	uh and gaming culture notes but um everything i've heard is that for what it is you would expect
3020640	3025440	that it's a shitty game usually these types of games are pretty shitty like you know when
3025440	3030720	corporate corporations and the army in a sense is a corporation trying to catch the corporation
3030720	3037040	yeah trying to cash in on what the cool kids enjoy right is usually kind of doesn't work out very
3037040	3043200	well but apparently this was a pretty decent game from what i heard so um that's part of why it was
3043200	3047840	successful is that you know and and i realize people have their criticisms and and it's fine
3048480	3054800	but it seems like the people that were making this game were actually listening to what gamers kind
3054800	3060560	of wanted to play and actually developing a game that would be fun and not what like research
3060560	3064960	groups said would be fun a boring recruitment tool isn't gonna it won't recruit anybody
3065600	3072720	right so well the other thing too is like the federal aviation administration um had a hiring
3072720	3079280	campaign they were looking for 4300 air traffic controllers in about five years and they focused
3079280	3088160	on gamers and they met they i think supposedly are already well on their way to um to hitting
3088160	3094080	their goal but a lot of you know these different institutions now are eyeing
3095760	3104240	games and gamers for their their hiring base you know because certain skills hand-eye coordination
3104240	3110080	you know of course would carry over and then they also you know can judge mindsets by what type of
3110080	3114480	games people are playing you know so there's a lot of you know very interesting psychology that goes
3114480	3121120	into it but you know and of course there's also then putting out you know i call it the the last
3121120	3127680	star fighter syndrome who all remembers that movie it's been a long time where you know they put out
3127680	3133840	the arcade machine and it was a test to see who was going to be the next star fighter um and then
3133840	3139120	then the guy gets kidnapped and goes to outer space and you know and then his robot twin makes
3139120	3149920	out with his girlfriend but anyway um they're using different games also as sort of uh disguised
3149920	3157040	tests for certain skill sets and so you know i i just still think it's very interesting that
3157040	3162800	we have so many government facilities that are like oh games are bad and the army's like fuck
3162800	3168400	yeah games yeah we're gonna use these games we're gonna get some more some more grunts i had no idea
3168400	3172320	about the air traffic controller thing and then i think about like something like flight simulator
3172320	3178560	where it's like okay maybe flight simulator is not anything like actually flying a real plane
3178560	3184880	but it really is educational as to what all goes into it like if you actually play flight simulator
3184880	3190320	on you know simulator mode you're really thinking about especially this new one that Microsoft put
3190320	3195360	out not that long ago um really gets into the weeds on like here's everything that goes into
3195440	3200480	takeoff and you're taking classes at your computer basically um and again i'm not trying to say that
3200480	3206640	like oh i played flight simulator i can fly a real plane suddenly no but you'll have an absolute leg
3206640	3213040	up on somebody who's never uh touched that you know if you were to uh want to take actual you
3213040	3221200	know plane flying classes so uh very interesting uh with gaming as a recruitment so i'm going to
3221200	3227280	our chat for some additional comments sg100 matt says geez 22 years old since this was in beta i
3227280	3231840	remember seeing america's army at digital life i wouldn't have guessed it was still going on yeah
3231840	3238880	i thought it had faded out a few years ago but i i felt it still had an impressive run um so you know
3238880	3246480	i mean i again games like this usually come out are laughed at and fade away within a year so the
3246560	3251920	fact that this one lasted over 20 years pretty fascinating to be honest yeah yeah and with
3251920	3259600	constant development so pretty cool yeah pretty cool all right let's move on loki all right so
3259600	3264800	of course with all the acquisitions that microsoft is making everyone is kind of asking so you know
3264800	3270640	all these games go in the games pass isn't that gonna raise the price of games pass you know it's
3270640	3274320	gotta happen at some point because where's all this money gonna come from that they're buying
3274320	3280240	all these companies with well apparently phil spencer was trying to kind of uh point out that
3280240	3286080	no no no no they don't have plans right now to raise the price of game pass um so kind of
3286080	3290400	addressing the rumors that it was going to go up in price i feel like i can't prove this negative
3291040	3296560	um people ask one is the game pass price going to go up they're buying all these studios you know
3296560	3302400	it's inevitable even though it's been for what now four years we haven't raised it but it's like you
3302400	3307280	know it's coming when are they when they are number one they're gonna start doing all these
3307280	3313040	exclusive deals like that you know xbox has history and all i can do is make decisions that
3313040	3316880	are in front of us and try to be explicit about what our goals are so it sounds like that they're
3316880	3321840	trying to at least be pretty transparent with it um that they don't have plans to raise the price
3321840	3327520	of games pass and i'm sure when they do that they will let everybody know yeah they'll raise it
3327520	3332880	eventually don't kid yourself or i mean they'll they'll absolutely raise it eventually i what i
3332880	3338240	hope does doesn't happen is i don't want to see them go into tears that would be really crappy
3338240	3342240	um so i really hope microsoft doesn't go that direction but um because then then you end up in
3342240	3348080	the nintendo problem the lowest tier gets hardly any love i mean i guess hooray we got earthbound
3348080	3353760	um but you know what what other bones are they going to throw at it over the next year um so
3353760	3357760	yeah i don't want to see microsoft tear it i think we should all prepare for the price to
3357760	3365760	go up and let's also be real if you are a smart shopper trademark patent pending um you'll never
3365760	3370560	pay full price for game pass and i've talked about it here on the show is that obviously you know i'm
3370560	3376000	sure you all follow those gaming deals whether it be you know the cheap ass gamer wario 64 all those
3376000	3380720	types of put that when those cards go on sale and they will go on sale and i'm sure there are plenty
3380720	3388960	of you show of hands how many of you on black friday or around that time will stock the fuck up
3388960	3395520	on uh your cards for you know playstation microsoft and so forth for the next year
3395520	3401920	i'm sure there's people that do that for sure um uh and uh i've also talked about that i use the
3401920	3407280	microsoft rewards app uh now and i i understand why people might be adverse to using that because
3407280	3411520	essentially you're allowing you know extra data to go to microsoft and all this stuff and you
3411520	3418480	actually have to use bing which some people might fear um but i use it casually and i would say
3419520	3424720	one out of every three months i get comped through microsoft rewards you end up getting 12 000 points
3424720	3429360	and get a free month and so you know i i hope they would keep things like that into place if
3429360	3435440	nothing else you could probably get a discount so you know again if you're if you're a choosy choosy
3435440	3442400	shopper you'll never pay full price for these things so uh pod culture and chat says i loaded
3442400	3449120	up on black friday yep uh mike def says maybe uh sj100 matt saying i'm glad i have game pass
3449120	3455040	locked in for the next two years that xbox live gold trick oh that's probably also keeping them
3455040	3459920	from raising the price these people that are still locked in that won't have to pay it i wonder if
3459920	3464800	they're gonna wait another two years for everybody to be out of that that would be very interesting
3464800	3469440	uh fifth dream points out i think i have playstation network for three more years
3469440	3474480	so again kind of loading up uh maybe when it was cheap and you know what how how far out can you
3474480	3481680	load up xbox live like three years or something like that i mean if we think it's coming maybe
3481680	3486400	load up your account the next time these things go on sale something something to think about
3487200	3493440	but i also know that's a big you know that's a big uh cost and not maybe everybody's super into
3493440	3497600	game pass i don't know but uh i think it's great i love that they're building the cloud stuff into
3497600	3504320	it too so uh i plan to stick with it for a little while so all right uh did your mom says you can
3504320	3510640	load up to five years if i recall correctly uh as shown her matt says three years uh i wonder if you
3510640	3516080	know we might be talking about conversion uh that whole thing versus how much you can actually load
3516080	3519920	up i don't know i'd have i have to look into it i'm not sure the answer but it would be at least
3519920	3524880	i'm sure it's at least two three years that you can load in advance um something to think about
3524880	3531280	if you're that worried about the price going up um anyhow let's talk about a new playstation 5
3531280	3535200	update that's coming out uh since we've been talking a lot about microsoft let's show a little
3535200	3541440	love to sony after all isn't uh i think horizon forbidden west is this week isn't it that's uh
3541440	3545040	that's a big deal for sony so i'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be on that this
3545040	3551920	week um so uh anyway there will be a new system update for place actually sorry i i my mind
3551920	3557760	derailed again but i wanted to say i heard the speaking of horizon forbidden west i heard it is
3557760	3565360	two discs on playstation 4 you don't hear that one very often what year is this well it's because
3565360	3575760	it's a 90 gig install so uh laughs in call of duty updates yeah well yeah it's a lot but i'm
3576640	3581120	i mean there's two ways to look at it there's one going uh it's gonna eat so much of my space but
3581120	3586720	then you also go that means it's a fucking big game well also like if it's a 90 gig install at
3586720	3592240	least they have it on disk and they're not like saying hey you can download that first or you can
3592240	3596480	you know download that first 10 from the disc but you gotta download the rest from the cloud
3596480	3603040	good luck yeah i am so excited y'all my new internet that i'm gonna have as of saturday
3603040	3610000	no limit no limit yay i i can reconnect my xbox to automatic updates again i'm so excited
3610000	3616480	download all of the updates update all you want i cannot wait to download the shit out of everything
3616480	3621520	i can finally run my steam updates that i've been backlogged for like years it's fucking exciting
3621520	3627520	y'all all right anyway yeah or as to 100 matt making the classic bemoni reference going no
3627520	3636480	no limit no no no limit all right um anyway uh as 200 matt also used google fu to find out 36
3636480	3641040	months is the max you can load up uh xbox live but interesting mike def says it depends on the
3641040	3646720	region because mexico is only two and a half years oh that is interesting it could be by region too
3646720	3651360	all right sorry we derailed i wanted to talk about this new update for playstation 4 and playstation
3652000	3658160	that is going to be adding new accessibility and quality of life features including voice commands
3658160	3662800	uh right now a beta is going to be made available to english-speaking users in the u.s and uk
3663360	3668000	that will let you say hey playstation and sorry if i woke yours up but i don't think this beta
3668000	3672640	is actually out yet but it will be soon you can turn this feature off just like all the other
3672640	3677920	home assistants if you want and then you can use your voice to launch games whatever apps
3677920	3684400	open the system menu control media playback and so on and so on i have to say i i never saw myself
3684400	3689920	really using a lot of the voice commands but i have found it awfully convenient for the bedroom
3689920	3698720	tv which has a google chrome cast on it to say hey you know the word smart assistant um uh turn
3698720	3704720	on my television and launch twitch and it's nice to just have it all come up there while i'm you
3704720	3709280	know you know brushing my teeth and other stuff and then i can crawl into bed and watch twitch
3709280	3714720	before uh i drift off so it's just kind of kind of neat uh so they're building the same thing into
3714720	3718720	playstation why not there's a lot of media and stuff on playstation and if you want to launch
3718720	3725360	games that way sure why not also group chats will now be known as parties and you can decide if you
3725360	3731120	want them to be private or public parties so there's that uh if you leave a party public and
3731120	3736080	open your friends can join their friends can join so it definitely will be a party
3736080	3741600	also you'll now be able to filter games by genre and have five of them on the console's home screen
3741600	3747200	for quick access apparently trophy cards are going to be redesigned on ps5 and there will be more
3747200	3752080	screen reader languages which is great for accessibility and some other changes as well
3752080	3758240	you can opt into the beta test if you want over at playstation.com but get on that uh
3758240	3762720	wednesday is when they're gonna uh send out the emails on if you got in or not but that's pretty
3762720	3769200	exciting so uh let's see fifth dream in chat says that was always a good idea but usually muscle
3769200	3775440	memory and clicking buttons to launch games and whatever it's just quicker yes and no i do agree
3775440	3780880	with you but sometimes they change the interface uh and playstation is done at least on playstation
3780880	3785040	four because like you have to launch everything through the tv and video app when it comes to
3785040	3790720	stuff like twitch and stuff like things move around so it is and then like it it starts it's
3790720	3796560	not as fast as it used to be so like i have to launch it and wait for the icons to show up so
3796560	3801040	i can see where twitch is today or if it got rearranged or whatever at least that's been my
3801040	3809120	experience i just it's just easier to tell my uh you know a home assistant by uh g o o g l e to
3809920	3813520	sorry i'm really trying to not launch all of your assistants i have to remember that in this day
3813520	3820240	and age you you could call it uh call it gurgle yeah sure sure so i can say gurgle uh do this
3820240	3825280	thing and uh yeah it's just easier i think you just you you adapt the muscle memory i guess
3826880	3834640	all right uh up next oh it's this headline again we always like to hear this person in the news
3834720	3844480	because it makes for a funny headline right dark sagra yeah so um bowser has a 40 month stint to
3844480	3850000	do in prison yeah but not the bowser you're thinking uh unless you are thinking of the
3850000	3857040	hacker gary bowser so um he was the the person that had the switch hacking group team uh
3857920	3866000	executor um and so uh of course he's not doug bowser just saying even though they got their
3866000	3871920	names mixed up in the original version of the article oops um but he was part of a collective
3872480	3878640	that uh sold devices that you could use to pay to play pirated games on your switch um
3879040	3885520	they the fbi arrested him in 2020 and he agreed to pay 10 million to nintendo
3885520	3890640	for a civil privacy lawsuit and then another 4.5 million for restitution
3891840	3898000	but the sentencing today um not today but when they were doing the sentencing uh he was facing
3898000	3904320	up to 10 years in prison um and also because video game publishers apparently have lost more
3904960	3912880	than 65 million thanks to what team uh executor did they were wanting to to go for that instead
3912880	3919520	he is getting he got 40 months so that's still you know a big chunk out of his life and they're
3919520	3927680	still looking to find um his accomplices so that's really about all we know now but but yeah he's
3927680	3934800	being sentenced assisted well in 40 months maybe is when they'll release super mario odyssey 2
3934800	3940400	because bowser will get out of prison and kidnap the princess yet again uh dart tetsuya in chat
3940400	3944960	says i know everyone is taking up pitchforks against nintendo but i heard this guy had
3944960	3949840	malicious code in his mods i don't know if i can feel too sorry if that's the case um i don't know
3949840	3953360	if i'd believe everything i read on the internet but at the same time i also don't understand the
3953360	3958560	pitchforks against nintendo for this i mean this guy was pretty cocky from what i understand like
3958560	3963360	nintendo had slapped this guy down a couple times before and he was kind of continuing his stuff
3963360	3969200	thinking he was invincible so it kind of sounds like he got what was coming to him like exactly
3969200	3975760	and and the thing is it's one thing that if they're you know giving something away for for
3975840	3983120	free you know right but the fact that he was making money off of someone else's work pretty
3983120	3990880	much you know or as a uh an exploit to get around somebody else's work i mean it's i and now you
3990880	3997440	know i'll be honest i had like you know an r4 back in the day and and all of those but at the
3997440	4004560	end you know those for active systems those are things that are that are taking you know money
4004560	4010160	from the developers from from the people who are making the games and at this like if it was you
4010160	4015840	know say oh we've put out this you know the everdrive you know for a snus that's one thing
4015840	4023280	it's an old system they're not really making any money on you know obscure you know import games
4023280	4027920	unless they're going to put them out you know on the e-shop or something right so that's one thing
4027920	4035520	but for a modern active consistently updated and having released games for system that's many
4035520	4042720	hyphens in that phrase by the way um it makes perfect sense um and then to go around and be
4042720	4048080	oh i can't do shit to me and me and i'm like no do shit to him please yeah do lots of shit to him
4048080	4053840	and don't get me wrong i'm all for you know homebrew on consoles and you know unlocks to
4053840	4058320	do that and i realize it can be a slippery slope with piracy and i don't think we should be
4058320	4062960	pirating games i think we should you know support where we can the developers of worth but i'm all
4062960	4068400	for homebrew and things that open that up but when you're being very flagrant that you're doing it
4068400	4074400	for piracy which i kind of get the sense this guy was then it's kind of one of those why are we all
4074400	4081040	acting shocked that nintendo did this i i don't think you know we we nintendo is known for very
4081040	4085920	being very um aggressive to protect its shit but usually they're not going to try to send you to
4085920	4090880	jail they might shut you down like that youtuber um a few weeks ago but they're not gonna they're
4090880	4096320	not gonna go after that person to jail because they weren't like trying to flagrantly make money
4096320	4102000	off nintendo and pirate games and things of that sort and i think that's where uh this you know bad
4102000	4108320	bowser went wrong to be honest only sonic and chat says yeah modded my we too just a few years ago
4108320	4113440	yeah i modded mine and i'll also say it's the one time i did advocate for piracy because i did it to
4113440	4121600	play a game that nintendo refused to release here um and the sing star abba it uh i did end up doing
4121600	4127600	that but it was the xena i remember that's when tiara was visiting we came over it was xena blade
4127600	4132240	did it and then they ended up doing the game stop exclusive agreement which i still thought was shit
4132240	4137760	so i think in those circumstances i think it's a little more justified um but i mean like again if
4137760	4143440	i can walk into a target or other similar store you know and pick up the item off the shelf i
4143440	4149280	you know i'm probably gonna i'm 99.9 times out of 100 that's what i'll do but in those extreme cases
4149280	4153280	where you know what there's a game i want to play and the company refuses to release it in the us
4153280	4157040	i don't feel bad about piracy whatsoever in fact i would encourage people to pirate mother 3
4157040	4169440	oh um i i have a cartridge yeah i have a translated cartridge so but i will say to
4169440	4176720	companies credit even past where we were at with the nintendo we so many years ago i feel like
4176720	4182480	companies are finally realizing we live in a global sort of environment and we see more stuff
4182480	4187520	get released here um i think taiko no tatsujin is a great example we're seeing a lot of those
4187520	4193840	games ending up releasing here when you know uh we all remember a time when those were very uh
4193840	4200000	nuanced you know japanese releases only that never saw the light of day over here and now we're
4200000	4203520	seeing them because i think these companies realize oh yes we live in a global economy
4203520	4210960	economy so uh mike deaf says sing star abba was ps3 there was a comparable one on the wii um there
4210960	4216480	was it was a it was just dance maybe or what yeah it was just dance there was a comparable abba game
4216480	4221600	on wii so yeah i think it was no it wasn't just dance it was like let's dance abba or something
4221600	4229840	like oh yeah it's even worse knock off something oh like we sing abba yeah yeah we sing abba uh
4229840	4234240	orange right says i would have never guessed taiko would be a worldwide release game that
4234240	4239440	would get announced on nintendo directs back in the 2000s exactly so things are getting better
4239440	4244800	in that regard so that's why you don't hear me like you know this show has been on for 20 years
4244800	4249760	so you could probably go back and find rob roberts advocating piracy in certain scenarios
4250320	4256960	but these days the the reasons to do it are not you know the games are available for you to pay
4256960	4261440	for them and pay the developers for their work and i think that's what you should do in the case of
4261440	4268320	mother 3 that is not an option for us so steal away in this case it's a political protest you
4268320	4274560	know yeah in a way yeah you are protesting the fact that this game has a high demand in the us
4274560	4278560	and they aren't releasing it so we're taking matters into our own hands at the end of story
4278560	4284560	i will be happy to pay for it once it's made available to me indeed same absolute same all
4284560	4289920	right uh yeah as 200 matt says i mean we all modded our playstation ones to play ddr titles
4289920	4296480	well i would argue that konami konami is or you use the plug right but i would argue that konami
4296480	4300880	is one of the worst offenders and this is why i think that it's actually you bring that up
4301440	4307280	i think that's very relevant to the history of our show let's really send off studio n7 tonight
4307280	4313120	and take a look back at the 20-year history of the show in the early years of the show the only
4313120	4321840	way we could play ddr was to either pay excruciatingly high import fees for games or to mod
4321840	4328960	or to steal them essentially and i'm i'm sorry not sorry we stole them because that was the
4328960	4334320	only reasonable way to play them but you know what every time they released a mix here even if
4334320	4341680	it was subpar when ddr the original one came out on playstation the us version bought it konamiks
4341680	4346400	which i think turned like 22 years old this week i saw a tweet or something like that konamiks when
4346400	4351600	that came out bought it and all the other stuff bought those as well so um you know i would
4351600	4357040	support it when it finally would show up here uh and as joe and her map points out i remember it
4357040	4363680	was a big deal when the ds was region free yeah orange right says i even bought beatmania us
4363680	4370400	hey that control same but the controller was better remember uh yeah i well how many times
4370400	4377360	did we shave our 2dx japanese controller buttons and they think that you know mine actually had
4377360	4384400	the little pad mods underneath them um but then they constructed the new ones i think with
4384960	4389280	there's something very similar to those mods i heard there were some japanese players that
4389280	4395280	imported our version for that reason to get that controller yeah yep i i have a couple of friends
4395280	4400880	actually who were like hey can you send me a controller and i'd be like uh i'll see where i
4400880	4404800	can find them if i find oh well we just had someone so important for us sorry about it like
4404800	4411120	okay well i didn't buy it so fine i just i still have mine uh they just turned up in the garage
4411120	4418640	uh our old controllers for that so i have honey i actually need to find my copy of para para because
4418640	4424080	i have my biscuits and i don't have a game oh so and i wanted to bust it out and play it the other
4424080	4432320	day i actually was planning on hooking up uh uh 2dx uh fourth style so i could get no what no
4432320	4438000	was third style that had the right version of the safari oh yeah the slower one yeah the right
4438000	4443920	version of the safari not the crappy speedy one all right anyway let's move on too far down memory
4443920	4450880	lane but good times uh let's move on loki yeah so you know we've talked about how battlefield 2042
4450880	4457600	is kind of bad and because of that there is a change.org petition asking electronic arts to
4457600	4464880	offer refunds on all platforms for their players and they already have more than 150,000 people
4464880	4472880	that has signed that petition because it is pretty bad and they're losing players every day so
4474240	4479920	we'll see if that ends up happening the thing to note though is even though they have 150,000
4480000	4486400	signatures other campaigns have gotten a lot more signatures like for example making shaggy dlc in
4486400	4498720	moral combat 11 381 000 signatures so we'll see uh what pardon my ignorance on this but we all
4498720	4505440	know i don't usually play these type of games so what's wrong with the game loki can you translate
4505440	4512080	to gay for me yes i will translate so it is a very rushed and buggy put together game
4512800	4517360	for example some of the complaints that they have in there there's balancing issues with the
4517360	4521680	vehicles in the game hovercrafts are like way too op you can drive up the side of buildings with
4521680	4528160	those you can constantly respawn them um they may go from mass effect the very basics like a gun
4528160	4533680	play are just broken like you can literally empty a full clip into somebody and it doesn't register
4533680	4541200	a hit against them like just ridiculously stupid things like that so it's just it's very much broken
4542080	4549120	all right thank you for translating it sounds sounds like a hot mess it is a hot mess all right
4550640	4558640	um also a hot mess uh countries that don't support uh equal rights uh for all lgbtq people and we're
4558640	4564800	seeing that play out with a sims 4 wedding expansion and uh this expansion is not going
4564800	4570640	to release in russia because of federal laws over there that will not allow it to release
4570640	4577600	uh there was a law passed in 2013 uh that uh some folks uh outside of uh russia sometimes
4577600	4584480	call it the russia gay propaganda law um so basically uh maxis in a blog post called our
4584480	4589520	commitment to you a letter to our players from the sims team mentions that because there is a
4589520	4595280	wedding themed storyline involving a same-sex marriage between two characters uh it's a quote
4595280	4600720	not something we could freely share around the world and so the team wanted to quote explain the
4600720	4606000	decision that we've made not to release this pack in russia and it basically came down to the fact
4606000	4612960	that the team could either tell this story or uh they could uh and avoid the russia market or they
4612960	4619280	could change the content to meet those sorts of federal laws and they've decided to say uh we'll
4619280	4624480	just choose not to release it there at all um so this would be and i know we have listeners over
4624480	4629120	there so this would be a great this is one of those great opportunities where uh you could just
4629120	4635200	pirate it and play it anyway uh because not but i mean in this case it sucks because we should
4635200	4640800	support the developers but also it's funny because dark sakura talked about sometimes piracy being a
4640800	4648080	political protest and i feel in this particular case it really is right so very interesting so
4649040	4654080	but hey props to maxis first because you know other companies would have just said okay we'll
4654080	4660480	change the gender of the character um which they could have easily done um but they didn't do it
4661040	4665920	so that's great uh dart to see it says uh i remember that being a whole thing back around
4665920	4672240	the time of the winter olympics back then yeah so all right let's let's go back to
4672240	4678080	a simpler time shall we and uh revisit uh this segment that we love to do on our show
4689120	4694560	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull
4694560	4699520	out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week
4700640	4706480	and what did you pick for us this week dark sakura jockey crush as they say in the intro
4706480	4714960	of it jockey crush it is well you remember xtifer playing all the alien crush he could possibly play
4714960	4719040	yeah he he really loved your guys's old place yeah that was on we virtual console yeah
4719760	4729360	um well jockey crush is the third in that whole series so of course the uh the first one being
4729360	4735120	alien crush and then devil's crush well actually dragon's revenge is also i guess would sort of be
4735120	4742080	the third one that came out that was the the uh genesis one that wasn't as great as the others
4742080	4750000	but jockey crush is continuing with that sort of uh otherworldly theme in the fact that it's an
4750000	4758240	ogre themed uh jockey is a type of a japanese demon um but it's another pinball game virtual
4758240	4762160	pinball game this one came out on the super famicon it never came out in the us um and it's
4762160	4769200	an it's an excellent game if you like you know virtual pinball uh one of the the great things
4769200	4774320	about this one is that it has a lot more in common with devil's crush uh in the fact that
4774320	4782640	it has these uh six hidden stages um and you also have alternating two player play um different
4782640	4787600	options where you can have different control control configurations your ball physics things
4787600	4794080	like that you know different speed settings um you also have um you know different tiers like
4794080	4799840	i was saying in the in uh in your levels the third level has like moving targets and uh
4799840	4803440	different lanes that lead you back to the second level you know all kinds of ways that you can get
4803440	4812000	around through there um it's it's really a very beautiful game as well um it is a little on the
4812000	4820240	dark side but dark and vivid if if that makes sense um and in in fact it's actually even
4820240	4827040	considered you know an equal to any of the others in the series you know even slightly crisper in
4827040	4838400	terms of its uh its uh design and color scheme but uh jackie crush uh came out in 1992 uh again for
4838400	4847600	the super famicom put up by an access soft um and it's again in the whole crush series um it also
4847600	4849600	you know i'd have to say that
4851840	4860880	if you've got a way to play this game and you have not i would actually do it yeah this is
4860880	4865520	actually the official third game because that uh that genesis one that came out i don't really
4865520	4869040	think it was actually part of the part of the series like an official part of the series more
4869040	4878240	like a spiritual successor type game but um i i also you know it's got a like story to it
4878240	4886240	and everything about like you know the magical pinball from hell or something um and the the
4886240	4892160	sad thing about it is that while there are a lot of enthusiasts who do recall alien crush and
4892160	4896480	devil's crush um they don't know about jackie crush because it didn't come out over here i
4896480	4900000	know i've mentioned it on the show before fifth stream was talking about demon's tilt and demon's
4900000	4905520	tilt is an absolute spiritual successor to the series i i've actually streamed a decent bit of
4905520	4914480	this game as well um i jackie crush in fact i i might actually just bust this out later this week
4914480	4921120	and show it off um maybe on my wednesday night stream but it's really worth playing um of course
4921120	4926080	also developed by compile and compile has given us one of the other best games in the universe
4926080	4931520	the guardian legend so and on top of that too the music is really good
4933600	4940880	yeah i noticed the music in this is great oh yeah the music in this game it just really sets
4940880	4947600	the entire tone for it and on top of that you know there's uh gosh it's like this one
4948240	4954240	uh stage on the table where it's sort of like this sort of purple rocky
4954960	4961600	side and it's got this uh the jackie in the center of it you know in red and white and it almost
4961600	4967040	makes me think that it's like in this sort of abyss where everything else just has that sort
4967040	4973680	of red outlined and and it honestly feels like there's some true depth in the game even though
4973680	4982320	it's two-dimensional so i i have absolutely been enamored with this game um i wouldn't mind owning
4982880	4988560	an original of it and i've played it you know uh quite a few times i really enjoy it but i
4988560	4994960	just think that there's like a sort of crispness to this one that is missing from quite a few other
4994960	5002080	uh uh pinball tables and in fact uh the one on stream right now is always the mode that i called
5002080	5008880	uh space invader mode sort of um but i think that there are so many different variances in
5008880	5017200	in gameplay between the multiple stages that you have enough to keep you interested in it it's got
5017200	5024320	a good enough challenge to it that the replayability is absolutely there um okay
5024320	5028400	sorry to the podcast listeners but this mode that we're looking at on twitch right now this creepy
5028400	5036800	as fuck yeah it has sort of like this uh almost like kind of reminds me of miss nude world
5038480	5047120	the face in the background is sort of like almost like a type of no mask i think um but uh you also
5047120	5051280	have like these little spheres that are coming coming out almost like little uh scarabs what it
5051280	5057440	looks like and then uh you you're sort of arcanoid style except you've got your your paddles and so
5057440	5063440	you're shooting the little uh demon ball around and trying to destroy them all and then you have
5063440	5069840	to the eyes on the background start blinking in red and you have to shoot the ball into one of
5069840	5077680	those eyeballs and as you go through it the face changes more and more to the style of a hanya mask
5077680	5084560	if you don't know what that is go look it up um where it gets more and more demonic as you know
5084640	5088160	well i'd say more like you know traditional ogre style masks like
5088160	5096320	like i said like a hanya and it's really well detailed and absolutely gorgeous the the shading
5096320	5105920	i mean it's for pixel art it's good artwork wouldn't you say yeah see and and and like in
5105920	5110080	the level it's on now like the face is getting more orange and it definitely looks a lot more
5110080	5116800	like the traditional hanya so i i absolutely love this game especially you know bringing in the
5116800	5124720	mythos of this particular one i i absolutely love it um so i will talk about um the others in the
5124720	5129280	series just a little bit because i think i have talked about alien crush before and devil's crush
5129280	5135120	i think i've done them both as a classic game um the other game that i mentioned is dragon's revenge
5135840	5142800	which is sort of like a genesis answer um it's not really as good the ball physics are
5142800	5150080	not great i mean it's it's it's an amusing play i'll put it that way but it isn't great but there
5150080	5159520	was a uh a we wear release uh updated version of alien crush called alien crush returns
5160160	5164960	and it was pretty neat i mean i'll probably talk about that as a classic game later
5165760	5171520	but you know this is just one in the series i mean every game that's in the official crush
5171520	5176080	series is absolutely worth playing and then if you want the modern take on it like we're saying
5176080	5188000	earlier um there is a uh a demon's tilt on steam it is also available uh on mac on steam absolutely
5188640	5197120	absolutely a good way to satisfy that uh that'll crush pinball uh craving if you get it
5198640	5203520	so that's what i'm gonna throw in there jackie crush if you get a chance to play it absolutely
5203520	5207360	do and if you do play it let me know because i wouldn't know what you think of it it's one of
5207360	5214320	one of my favorite uh virtual pinball games great there it is your classic game of the week uh jackie
5214320	5219600	crush uh and i gotta say you know i'm kind of with the chat like i knew of course about aliens
5219600	5222800	crush and devil's crush like those are very hard games to miss especially if you followed the
5222800	5228160	terrific 16 at all um and i'm sure i think i feel like you've probably mentioned this in passing
5228160	5233760	because i just know you love this series um but i've not really sit down and watched it and listened
5233760	5238720	to it before and it's pretty cool like i wonder how this one kind of got lost i guess maybe maybe
5238720	5242480	it came out and later in the super nintendo's life or something i don't know it was 92.
5243280	5247440	oh yeah weird i just feel like it didn't come out in the u.s compared to the others
5249040	5252960	i mean if you think about it this way it's a pinball game number one which is a little bit
5252960	5262160	more obvious you know a genre for for a video game true and it didn't see the light of day outside of
5262160	5266400	japan back in you know those days it was much harder to get those imports and then of course
5266400	5271680	by the time importing became the big thing that it is like i didn't buy my first import game until
5271680	5278080	like 95 yeah i take that back 94 my first import game that i bought was uh the sailor moon s
5278080	5287840	fighting game um which actually now uh gwen has it i think i think i sold it to gwen um but uh
5287840	5295200	but going back to it i mean importing was like when i imported my sailor moon game i did it
5295200	5307040	by literal magazine mail order cod oh my god yeah so um it it's it was a different
5307040	5312080	is a different world than for for you know importing and we didn't have you know
5313520	5318320	emulators at least that were as sophisticated as this in fact i didn't think i actually even
5318320	5329040	had my first emulated game until maybe the late 90s late late 90s so i mean this game
5329040	5336480	came out when i was in 10th grade it was that long ago but it's i i mean i i know that i have
5336480	5341120	certain games that are like oh yeah play it it's fun and something i'm really like you gotta play
5341120	5347040	i say if you really if you like the the first two crash games you absolutely owe it to yourself to
5347040	5352240	play this one because this is an excellent game it's a wonderful addition to the series and i
5352240	5357520	honestly would love for them to put out like a crush compilation that has that kind of like the
5357520	5362640	monster boy treatment remember where you can switch back and forth between the old mode and
5362640	5370480	like a new updated mode um and i think that that that would sell i would buy i would buy it or
5370480	5375280	where you can play the switch vertically i always thought that was really cool for the um pinball
5375280	5380560	simulators that do that yeah well i mean the wonders the wondrous one the wondrous one color
5380560	5384320	back in the day was set to be played vertical horizontally because a couple of the clindola
5384320	5389440	games worked that way and you know they could easily do that with the switch but
5391200	5397680	when when all right opportunities all right there it is your classic game of the week great pick
5397680	5402560	very very educational for the folks tonight especially if you like pinball fan or if you
5402560	5408240	like pinball at all or like pinball inspired um games you know of which there's there's been a few
5408240	5413920	uh through the years you know uh even things like pinball quest or i think of like you know the
5413920	5419360	translations like uh pinbot and high speed that were so weird on the nes because they did shit
5419360	5425920	that you can't actually do physically uh and then music yeah which the originals really didn't have
5425920	5432080	anything like that i i i thought that someone did a rom hack of pinbot to turn it into jackpot i'd
5432080	5438320	have to take a look for that but the thing the thing with these that are like this in particular
5438320	5444080	and this is where my point is going on this is that these were made solely they're not a
5444080	5450800	translation they're not a recreation like you know pinmame or uh or pinball effects or something like
5450800	5459200	that these are virtual pinball that is meant to be played in that kind of environment it's built
5459200	5467680	for a console and so you get an experience on a table like that that you cannot get at all unless
5467680	5475840	you have like again one of those you know uh uh pinmame cabinets that has you know that a game
5475840	5479600	would be programmed for something like that the closest we even have to i mean that would work
5479600	5485520	something like that would work if you had where it would just move the the tables back and forth you
5485520	5490240	know on a virtual screen something like that would work but you also then miss feeling the
5490240	5496720	ball i guess and being able to control your tilts and whatnot but that's actually one thing i have
5496720	5501120	to go back and say about demon's tilt is that it actually does have a pretty decent tilt function
5501120	5506800	in it so um but i i could i could go on about this all day but that's the thing that makes these
5506800	5513200	games special is that they were programmed this way this is their intent and they're so unique
5513200	5519520	in that that it it's you can be a fan of pinball you could be a fan of puzzle games i'd put it that
5519520	5526800	way too and this game is definitely a test of your hand-eye coordination and it's challenging
5526800	5531440	in a way that conventional pinball isn't well i don't know if you'd want to play this table in
5531440	5535520	real life those those demon faces are scary as fuck i'd run out of the building screaming
5536160	5541280	i don't know i don't think they're that scary but maybe if it was like bleeding all over the place
5541280	5548320	and yeah maybe all right great pick let's get into some other news uh rapid fire style with
5548320	5556800	some rapid fire news loki to go to go along with the announcement and release of earthbound on
5556800	5566240	the snes um nintendo online service uh you can actually download the nintendo strategy guide

5577840	5583520	guide is in english the player's guide but uh you can check it out it's a pretty awesome strategy i
5583520	5587840	remember getting a bunch of those back in the day when you know they were putting them out for
5587840	5595920	different games uh so let's check it out and then uh we have some more announcements for tmnt

5648320	5656000	shack um they are uh they had an announcement at shacks fun house which a concert experience in la
5656000	5663600	um this weekend um actually they made the announcement on friday but um he is uh gonna

5670000	5678400	be a 65.8 inches high uh which is taller than their existing nba jam with a 19-inch screen

5708960	5718560	chibi and still look that constipated seriously um but anyway um he is a season pass exclusive
5718560	5721040	so if you were playing that go for it
5723760	5730400	i just don't like that i'm hearing about 800 mithril season pass and i'm like oh god how much
5731120	5736240	you know games as a service crap are they loading into this because i was really looking forward to
5736240	5740560	this but i'm not looking forward to all these microtransactions is it a free-to-play game
5740560	5745600	oh is it oh i didn't know i thought i just assumed it was a purchase game
5745600	5752080	if it's free to play i guess it's a little less annoying i like i like it's having options like
5752080	5756080	the free-to-play mmos but if you pay the subscription and you get a few bells and whistles
5757200	5763360	you know something like that is perfectly acceptable no all right um let us travel around
5763360	5767680	the world and check out some games that are coming out probably sooner than chocobo gp
5767680	5773200	because they're coming out this week and we'll start in the us uh to clarify apparently chocobo

5956240	5962320	little lighter tonight can't imagine why uh but we'll get to those that want to um uh participate
5962320	5967600	further with the show in our listener round table in a little bit uh but first loki it take to be
5967600	5973600	working on a new midnight club game some people like to think so because the developer visual
5973600	5981600	concepts who has worked on the nba 2k and wwe 2k series they are recruiting for an open world
5981600	5986080	driving game and immediately everyone thinks midnight club because you know rockstar has
5986080	5993120	that and stuff the work could be a new ip we don't know but there is a new driving game coming from
5993120	6002240	take two so we'll just have to see what it is at some point will it be midnight club who knows
6002240	6006400	how would you feel about a new midnight club it's not rockstar working on it i'm kind of
6006400	6014800	disappointed with that but meh whatever it's been a long time yeah it's been a while so i i
6014800	6019600	want i don't want to see some video see it in motion see what it looks like all right yeah
6019600	6027200	definitely dark sakura so uh there is a series that i i would probably say a lot of uh people
6027200	6034480	who are into import games especially dating sims know very well um tokimeki memorial which is uh
6034480	6042160	konami's a big dating sim it was the big one that everyone knew about um so there is an independent
6042160	6050800	uh retro game translator known as retro translator that um has uh his team working uh has sorry their
6050800	6056800	their team working on translating uh one of the tokimeki memorial games into english and it's
6056800	6065760	almost complete but here is uh the thing it is not uh tokimeki memorial forever with me which
6065760	6069040	is like the playstation one the one that everybody likes it was the one that was like the best
6069040	6076480	improved of them it's the snes one or the super famicom one uh which is uh tokimeki memorial
6079200	6083680	which translates to heartthrob memorial under the tree of legends you know i actually have
6083680	6094400	the tokimeki memorial oav on laserdisc um but it's it this is the big game i think that brought
6094400	6102960	dating sims to the fore like i mean they were already kind of big in in japan um and the i'm
6102960	6107440	sorry it's not forever with me it's forever with you um it was actually the upgraded version from
6107440	6115440	the pc engine super cd rom one the turbo graphic cd the snes one came out after the playstation one
6116320	6120480	and uh it didn't have any voice acting of course because it was this mess and it was just like
6120480	6130080	really watered down um so this is this is this is a toki memo that is just really not the one
6130080	6135200	that everyone wanted of course you know i think it would be easier to do a translate a translated
6135200	6145600	copy of the the snus one which for the record several already exist just saying um i yeah
6147120	6154400	um on top of that too you know some other people are like well why not do uh toki memo pocket you
6154400	6162160	know the one of the uh uh you know a handheld one to bring with it but at the same time you know
6162160	6168960	it is what it is for some people this is going to be the way that people start off with toki memo
6168960	6176880	um i personally would uh would like to see a translation uh an official release of uh
6176880	6182240	toki memo girl side where basically you play one of the female characters dating the boys
6183360	6189600	you know which as i was i thought it was pretty cool that you know in all of the world of boy
6189600	6196480	date girl you know dating sim thing they did in the toki memo series they did one where the girls
6196480	6204160	can go after the boys um i mean now of course we have a slew of you know various different
6204160	6212240	options for for dating sims including the very popular uh boyfriend dungeon and uh dream daddy
6212880	6220240	and uh uh the colonel sanders game which i still need to play blink blink but i i think
6221360	6227520	i'm glad i'm glad it's being done i'm not trying to to uh poopoo on the attempt it's just there's
6227520	6232480	better toki memo games to do the playstation one would have been absolutely astounding to have
6232480	6237840	just even the japanese voice acting is fine you know but have it translated into english you get
6237840	6246240	an authentic experience but in dialogue that you know that a westerner can understand
6248880	6253520	i'm sure also just i think you kind of addressed it just the tools kind of being easier and a
6253520	6257600	little more accessible for the super nintendo probably made it the one that was just like
6257600	6262800	the easier one to translate maybe so but hey making the game available for more people to
6262800	6268960	try out but like you said i guess translations already exist so but well there there are a few
6268960	6276800	other um fan translations that are coming out sort of a quote officially uh one of them is uh there
6276800	6283840	was a japanese exclusive yakuza game that came out on psp um that's called uh yakuza black panther in
6283840	6295440	english or uh i'm gonna mispronounce this uh um which yeah because a black panther um and then
6295440	6304880	uh another game called uh miser uh miserna falls so it's a ps1 game that where you can pet a dog
6304880	6310400	apparently that's uh that's getting a fan translation too um i also thought it was very
6310400	6318320	interesting that there's a fan translation out for uh the biohazard uh 1.5 almost a fully playable
6318320	6323440	version so pretty cool what a lot of like you know modders and translators are doing to make
6323440	6327680	more of these games playable by more people around the world pretty cool power of boredom and wanting
6327680	6332400	to play a game yeah well meanwhile while these folks work on new technologies and new things
6332400	6336640	that are great for games we have other big companies doing the exact opposite right loki
6337600	6345680	yes it's your weekly disappointment in the game industry your depression if you will of
6345680	6353840	the future that is coming the unwanted nft future that ubisoft is just running full speed ahead
6353840	6359440	into a wall with um so apparently one of the things that ubisoft is doing is they're
6359440	6368720	collaborating with the sandbox which is a game if you will um that's more of like a virtual space
6369360	6374960	that you can buy real estate in and walk around with avatar it basically looks like playstation
6374960	6380480	home if they monetize the crap out of it and made it blockchain made it stupid um so that's kind of
6380480	6386240	what that is and of course ubisoft's like yep sign me up for that uh so they've brought the
6386240	6392400	rabbits to it because everybody needs that um and then of course you know ubisoft employees
6392400	6399120	are still telling um their you know higher ups that nft suck and that they really shouldn't be
6399120	6406320	in that business um you know one of the there's some fun comments from the ubisoft employees like
6406320	6412000	are we competing with ea for the most hated game studio by the public uh because this is how you do
6412000	6418880	it i think the kids call this entire comment session um being ratioed um you know what else
6418880	6425280	makes a lot of money uh making fun spectacular groundbreaking blockbusters why don't we focus
6425280	6430720	on that instead you know what else is great in the company not sexually harassing your employees
6431760	6437040	but hey you know ubisoft gonna ubisoft so what can you do they just just play by some different
6437040	6442320	rules that's all you know if they could meant sexual harassment into the blockchain i'm sure
6442320	6447840	they would try to do that as well uh uh as she 100 matt and chad says i love that ubisoft's
6447840	6453680	internal employee forum was filled of employees dunking on the company's stance on nfts hey
6453680	6458320	that's why and you know shout out to those frontline employees at ubisoft that are fighting
6458320	6462800	the good fight on the inside because you know we've said this time and time again these stupid
6462800	6467840	decisions are never the fault of the hard-working you know frontline creators of these games it's
6467840	6473120	always some dumb fuck executive who shouldn't even be in this business uh who's making these calls and
6473120	6478640	it's it's very apparently clear with what you see with what's going on at ubisoft and uh good on
6478640	6488000	them for ray showing uh these these stupid things that people don't want um if yeah anyway um and
6488000	6493520	then of course a little bit more details regarding the whole team 17 worms nft announcement thing
6493520	6498640	that we kind of talked about i think last week um talking about how basically the employees
6498640	6505200	had no idea that this was even happening aside from the higher ups um you know and the qa
6505200	6512320	developers of course at team 17 are really not paid very well between 20 000 25 000 annually
6512880	6519280	and while they're yeah and so while they're struggling to pay bills you know there is
6519280	6524160	people that um they're going out there and trying to make a few extra bucks off of some
6524160	6534080	of their assets from the company so obviously um that's not a good look so wow yeah all right
6534800	6540480	uh well uh let's hope these ubisoft executives i get put in their place real soon and stop driving
6540560	6543360	the company in this direction or they're going to just drive them right out of business
6544160	6550160	um for our last uh official story tonight i thought this was a fun one to go out on uh
6550160	6556560	the fact that uh maim uh known as the multiple arcade machine emulator is what maim stands for
6556560	6564480	uh just turned 25 years old uh believe it or not its debut was the feb February 5th of 1997
6564480	6569280	if you've never heard of maim that's kind of surprising uh it's an emulator that runs all
6569280	6576240	sorts of old um arcade emulation uh and a lot of a lot of stuff than throughout the years i remember
6576240	6581040	i mean i'm dating myself obviously but whatever i remember being around when maim kind of first came
6581040	6586400	out and it was a lot of the really old like namco boards and atari boards where they first started
6586400	6591040	but then obviously you know maim started to get into you know newer and newer stuff when they
6591040	6596640	started getting stuff like street fighter 2 and uh mortal combat and then you know even beyond that
6596640	6601120	uh it really became its own thing and of course i wish that they could still do the hikaru
6601120	6606720	software that would have been amazing uh of course maim does state on the official maim website their
6606720	6613200	purpose is to preserve decades of software history uh and maim prevents important vintage software
6613200	6618400	from being lost and forgotten uh achieved by documenting the hardware and how it functions
6618400	6623440	the source code to maim serves as this documentation so um yeah again you know a lot
6623520	6628320	of people might jump to oh these bad things you know maim leads to piracy and all that but
6628320	6633040	you know again there's a lot of rights and a lot of things that get lost out there throughout the
6633040	6637920	years also games are just not available i mean like where are you going to find like it it's
6637920	6642720	like if you want a certain type i mean granted they have you know arcade went up for a lot of
6642720	6647600	things but there's a lot of games that are very obscure out there that good luck finding hardware
6647600	6654480	for that and some old creators from the 80s uh made public domain their roms basically who had
6654480	6660000	the right rights and license to do so and were like yeah maim's pretty cool and so you can uh
6660880	6665200	distribute this however much you want so there are there are there is a set i don't know how
6665200	6670560	many games are uh technically public domain but there's a set of you know at least 10 games
6670560	6675200	probably more at this point it's been a while since i've looked that are absolutely free to
6675200	6678960	get maim and use them and have fun with it and experience some old arcade games
6679840	6685200	and then what also was interesting about this uh the 2021 release capcom arcade stadium which is
6685200	6692560	relatively i have that on the switch apparently it was using code from maim in it so not a huge
6692560	6697360	surprise i'm sure uh interesting how that's come full circle the surprise was they actually
6697360	6703920	credited them which is nice yeah that is true yeah that is nice so but also apartment just being a
6703920	6709920	nice gesture it also does sort of cover their tail legally right because i remember i feel
6709920	6716640	like there was something that didn't do that and it became it was oh yeah yeah no i thought there
6716640	6720400	was something that's obs yes but i thought there was something involving maim too but yeah that
6720400	6727200	was a kind of an adjacent issue for sure yeah it's the same thing you know if they had they
6727200	6731680	weren't supposed to use obs in the name or they were supposed to credit or something and none of
6731680	6736320	that happened uh dart to see is talking about the public domain games talking about robbie
6736320	6740800	roto off the top of my head but there's a few others yeah i think that's the one um they
6740800	6747680	released that uh on like the of the phone stores and uh that's the it was a full running copy of
6747680	6753760	maim that they and you were able to load it basically on your um uh devices and play games
6753760	6758640	that way that's how i have uh on my ipad my old ass ipad at this point uh a version of maim
6758640	6765040	basically is uh from from that being available for like a week uh but orange right says maim
6765040	6771280	preserves so many games that we would have never heard of absolutely uh dart says uh capcom arts
6771280	6776160	arcade stadium has its issues but i do fire it up now and then for some classic arcade fun yeah
6776160	6780480	it's it's like everything else i've talked about when they do like legal versions especially when
6780480	6784800	they you know enhance it a little bit which you know capcom arcade stadium has like the achievements
6784800	6789120	the online leaderboards you know they they some different graphical ways of looking at it they
6789120	6793840	tried to sweeten the pot a little bit i supported it because i like retro gaming it's fun and i like
6793840	6798320	when the companies dip into their back catalogs i wish there would be another midway arcade treasures
6798320	6802400	collections there's some really good stuff in there but um we haven't seen those releases in
6802400	6813760	a very long time so holy crap hmm ivan reitman died oh gosh yeah i i i just saw the the posting
6813760	6820720	about it from associated press it's like just now huh well i didn't mean to derail everything with
6820720	6830800	it but uh but yeah wow no that's fine wow all right time to watch ghostbusters yeah gosh okay
6831440	6840240	uh moving on let's get to our listener round table uh we invite your uh emails at participate
6840400	6846160	orange lounge radio.com and i think i saw one come in uh we do have one so let's get to it let's get
6846160	6853520	to our emails first so it's one email and you'll know who it is email singular and you'll know who
6853520	6862240	it is the moment i start reading it you ready hello lr hi it's been a while but i've been
6862240	6867360	listening to the podcast for just about this whole time congratulations rob to you and alan on the
6867360	6873600	new place i'm looking forward to seeing the new studio smiley face rob you were right we you did
6873600	6878720	in fact release in november of 2012 when it launched with a really really fun tech demo
6879520	6886640	a 2d mario game and a bunch of third-party games that would most likely uh already played on other
6886640	6891920	platforms i would argue that the unexciting launch lineup and the many long stretches between big
6891920	6897280	game releases did as much to hurt the wii u as its awful name i kept defending that name you
6897280	6904800	know that and i still kind of defend it um despite this i do still actively have mine hooked up
6904800	6912080	primarily for don't laugh at me we fit you that now that name is funny i'm just saying no i i and
6912080	6916240	i wouldn't laugh at that either i mean it was a great fitness title right yeah i know i know a
6916240	6921600	lot of people have kind of graduated for lack of a better term to ring fit but i also know it's a
6921600	6927040	different like ring fit and we fit you are are very different games so um no i don't i don't
6927040	6932880	fault you i'm not gonna laugh at you for keeping that hooked up and i um and i have a hard time
6932880	6939680	believing that switch sports will top we sports club but i guess we'll see soon enough i was
6939680	6944240	delighted that wolfenstein 3d was mentioned during the classic game of the week segment recently
6944240	6948960	i was also happy to hear that both the mac version and the modding community were mentioned you
6948960	6953680	probably already know this if you watched my yyr game's 10th anniversary retrospective videos but
6953680	6959920	only a handful of people did so i'll tell you that i was a member of wolf addict software the largest
6959920	6966720	modding group for the mac version during the mid to late 90s 1990s we actually sold several scenarios
6966720	6971280	created by our members including new levels graphics audio and more because the mac version
6971280	6976720	of wolf 3d came out later it featured higher resolution graphics and an engine capable
6976720	6982560	of more things than the original it was super fun to be a part of this but what's really surprising
6982560	6987920	is that there is currently an ongoing effort to bring the mac wolfenstein 3d mods back to modern
6987920	6994160	systems it's called mac and wolf and i highly recommend that you google it if you are interested
6994160	7001200	in checking out some vintage classic gameplay that's m a c e n wolf have fun everyone i'll end
7001200	7007120	on this note i am normally an optimist so um and i would normally never cast doubt on something
7007120	7012800	i truly love but i am sorry to say that unless olr moves to a more frequent broadcast schedule
7012800	7019520	it will never reach episode 9000 with its current hosts well that is unless you're good to go for
7019520	7026880	another 156 years or more if you miss more than a few weeks um i'm sorry to have to deliver the
7026880	7032320	bad news but honestly thank you for another week of this show that we all enjoy so much and enjoy
7032320	7038560	your week off looking forward to whatever is next erin yyr well you know we can number these
7038560	7043440	episodes however the fuck we want to so when we numbering is arbitrary when we want to do episode
7043440	7048880	9000 we will well you know and and you know um there's another podcast out there um gamertag
7048880	7055840	radio who crossed a thousand episodes even though um they started two three years after we did sorry
7055840	7059600	i don't know the exact day is not i'm certainly not here to shade anybody there's a lot of work
7059600	7064880	that went into that um danny and the crew over there work very hard on what they do um but they
7064880	7070560	also put out multiple episodes a week and i think during e3 a lot of episodes like usually like
7070560	7075040	historically so um they were kind of able to and so a lot of people assume that that is the longest
7075040	7082240	running show because they have more episodes um we could have there was a time when i was uh
7082240	7086080	clipping up some of you may remember this some of you longtime listeners where i was clipping up
7086080	7091680	olr and i was putting out the first half on the feed on like monday and the second half on like
7091680	7097600	wednesday to try to kind of fill the week but the big feedback i got after about a year was like
7097600	7101920	stop doing that we just want to listen to it all in one you know go and i did kind of go like why
7101920	7106960	am i doing that but it's funny because you know maybe if i counted those as separate episodes
7106960	7110960	we would have hit a thousand by now but i'm not out to yuck somebody's yum like it's just you know
7110960	7116240	it is what it is we've done a we've done a weekly thing and and uh pissing in the cornflakes exactly
7116240	7125280	exactly so um but uh if but i guess my point is aaron if you do want us to hit uh 9 000 episodes
7125280	7129920	i guess i could start uh chopping up the show into five minute chunks and releasing those all
7129920	7134880	as separate episodes but i'm not sure what the podcast folks would think about that so uh pod
7134880	7140640	culture says there was also olr to go the interesting thing about that is that um before
7140640	7149040	the shows merged so our live show in the podcast merged around episode 180 i want to say question
7149040	7154160	mark it's probably on the wiki somewhere so yeah technically there were 50 episodes or so of the
7154160	7161200	show that weren't like counted accounted for somewhere else but i think there would be other
7161200	7165840	people that would argue well the shows that weren't actually a podcast that we did on live
7165840	7171120	365 shouldn't be counted and i i beg to differ because they exist and we've been doing them but
7171120	7177200	again it's just it's it's arbitrary just like dark soccer said it's all in what you choose to
7177200	7183040	do and how you want to do it so uh as 200 matt says each story is an episode you'll hit 9000
7183040	7190080	no problem uh and yes dark to see absolutely he just wants the chance to make the over 9000 joke
7190080	7195600	absolutely um you know what one of these days over 9000 words spoken that's right
7199120	7207120	so where are we on that uh uh the guinness thing i already they they sent it back remember oh
7207120	7212720	because we have to do it as a as a company i didn't resubmit because i we need to have uh the
7213680	7220320	like some sort of company way to do it i think we could probably submit it under vog network but i
7220320	7224400	think there'd be a charge with that so we'd have to figure that out there's there's still going to
7224400	7229120	be a free when the charge comes if you want the accelerated application oh okay um maybe we can
7229120	7235200	do that then i'm i've got to dig into it but i've had real life stuff going on too so it might my
7235200	7239840	health issues have taken priority because i'm still dealing with that whole uh narcolepsy
7239840	7247760	diagnosis crap all right uh yeah pod culture i remember that we'd record pod culture in a chunk
7247760	7252800	and i'd chop it up yeah and it just you know it just is all depends on how you want to do it no
7252800	7259120	no biggie all right um let's see uh let me i didn't check discord to see if we had any callers over
7259120	7263680	there if you want to give us a call you can just head on over to vog network.com discord and join
7263680	7268720	our green room uh nobody's there now and i know we just we just have a smaller turnout live tonight
7268800	7272960	because of things that are going on on television even though my understanding is it's over now
7272960	7276640	but i'm sure folks are still with their you know friends family and people they hang out with on
7276640	7281200	days like today so it's probably just going to be more of a podcast heavy week and that's okay too
7281200	7286000	we love our podcast audience feel free to say hi to us either on social media like twitter's
7286000	7291280	a great place to say hi at olr uh and of course the email bag as well like aaron did this week
7291280	7296960	participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us an email uh let me check in
7296960	7302480	with loki and see if there's any last minute stories yes there is one so there's a game coming
7302480	7310320	out called martha is dead um it's coming out on pc playstation and saw this on discord yeah
7311120	7316720	so on the playstation version they're actually censoring the game uh because there's a very
7316720	7322320	sensitive scene that's being depicted in the game um spoilers they cut off someone's face and then
7322320	7328480	put it on um so that apparently is not going to be on the playstation five and playstation
7328480	7336560	four versions um but the other versions will be just fine this game sounds like a bit much for me
7336560	7342320	yeah it sounds like that said though like they had really violent stuff though in like last of
7342320	7347520	us two and stuff so like did they cut off someone's face i don't know i didn't play last
7347680	7350960	wasn't there also something about like the sister
7352240	7356960	it's there was something like really weird sounding and i was just like this game isn't
7356960	7362320	for me that's all i was i read it i was like this game isn't for me um sj100 matt in chat says people
7362320	7369600	are so mad about this well then don't buy it on playstation yeah it's like it's pretty simple um
7370480	7377760	sia tabirian chat says it's not as if they were renaming at martha's badly maimed uh fifth dream
7377760	7384160	says oh it's your sister's face that's gross what a weird game but what i hey y'all are into whatever
7384160	7389760	you're into enjoy your horror porn if that's your thing i will be watching over here off once
7389760	7396800	already so it's it's all good i think that was a little different all right uh if there's no other
7396800	7400720	last minute stories then i think we will move to close up shop tonight i know it's a little

7530240	7535440	uh thank you all for being a part of it whether uh you've been here on twitch uh as we made the

7540880	7544960	years as well because this place was really only set up to do audio uh but we've seen all the
7544960	7550160	changes and so forth as well so a big farewell to studio and seven i am really looking forward

7556160	7560560	really want us to all be back in person uh it's just one of those things we'll have to play by ear
