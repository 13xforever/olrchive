1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,320
I've frequently stated how the Wii's runaway success was due largely to Wii Sports and

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,080
casual game buyers, and how Wii U's disappointing sales weren't disappointing, they just weren't

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,880
the lightning in a bottle that the Wii was.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
If that's true, then how has the Nintendo Switch exceeded Wii's console sales?

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,280
Is it the appeal of the docked and mobile switching nature, 2-in-1 value?

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,800
Has the depth of the game library been valuable for every Nintendo target demographic?

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,240
These are questions I've asked rhetorically.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,520
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give you the underlying

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,280
numbers and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Hello, my friends out there on this internet.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:48,120
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,480
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again, episode number 902 of our show

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,760
for this February the 8th of 2022.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,720
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined by my co-hosts.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,160
Say hello as always to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Hello.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Hi.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
How are you?

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
I'm okay.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Good.

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,880
I'm having OBS problems tonight for some weird reason, and I'm seeing something completely

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,680
different other than...

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
There you are.

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Hello.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
Okay.

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
Whew.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
And all the joy will be when we...

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
I've been here.

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
No, I know you have.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,440
It was showing something else on my screen.

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,240
So all the joy is when we broadcast live here at the Voice Geeks Network, because we do tape

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,400
live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,320
show at the Voice Geeks Network on Twitch, twitch.tv slash V-O-G network.

35
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,120
Did I leave anything out?

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,760
No, I think I got it all.

37
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,800
Next week is the decommissioning of Studio N7.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,960
Do you have any favorite Studio N7 memories, Dark Sakura?

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Coffee.

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Coffee.

41
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Oh yeah.

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
Making a lot, because...

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,880
I don't have coffee tonight, because husband said you might go to Starbucks.

44
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Yeah.

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Mr. Smoosh says snort.

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,200
But yeah, hopefully you can come see the new play.

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,920
Of course, for those that missed the news, Alan and I are moving to a new place.

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,680
So this studio will be no more after really next week's episode is going to be the last

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
one.

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,000
So it'll be the last chance to celebrate a lot of shows from this studio.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,640
And because honestly, the transition from us being on Shoutcast to Twitch to virtual

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,560
kind of all happened here.

53
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,520
So it's been a lot of change for the show here.

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Also say hello tonight to Techmaster Loki.

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Hello.

56
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Hey, Loki.

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
What's that game playing behind you tonight?

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
I'm trying to see.

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Lil Nemo.

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,640
Oh my gosh, I haven't played that game in a very long time.

61
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
What made you want to play that?

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,240
Or what made you think of that one for your background tonight?

63
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,520
I don't know.

64
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
So many games I've already picked.

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,720
I was like, I gotta pick something different.

66
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Sure, sure.

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
I understand.

68
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,320
Hey, I know you had an update to give on a frequent guest contributor to the program.

69
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Yeah.

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,720
So it's been a rough week.

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,220
So I found out that the sickness I had last week that we thought was not COVID was COVID.

72
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,800
So there's that, which is fun.

73
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:42,140
So unfortunately, I knew last week that we were going to schedule my cat to be put down.

74
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:51,380
And so it's just her health had been kind of, not like getting, it had been gradually

75
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,380
getting worse.

76
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:59,140
She's been losing weight for, oh gosh, like at least a year and a half.

77
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,660
She was down to under probably around five pounds at the time.

78
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,340
Just all skin and bones, basically.

79
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,700
No matter what we would try to give her, it wasn't really doing anything.

80
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,300
And no, she's just, they didn't know what was wrong with her.

81
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,660
She had neurological problems at one point.

82
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,540
We thought that she might have had a stroke because she was kind of circling in certain

83
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
directions.

84
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,000
That seemed to get better, because I thought she was going blind to it for a while.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,780
But then, so we just made the choice that's like, okay, it's not getting any better.

86
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,380
It's something we can really do for her.

87
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:44,740
We had some pretty rough weeks where she was just throwing up and diarrhea and all that

88
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
stuff.

89
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
She stopped grooming herself.

90
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,180
So yeah, unfortunately on a Thursday, we had to put her down.

91
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,180
Yeah.

92
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,440
I'm really sorry to hear that.

93
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,540
And I know that's not an easy decision, but I know you did what's right for Stella and

94
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,620
it was probably a lot harder for you.

95
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,080
It was especially hard knowing that I knew when it was going to happen.

96
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:16,780
So I had four days to like, so I just try to spend as much time with her as I could.

97
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,420
And good on you doing that.

98
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,440
So many pets don't get to have a great home and a great place to be, but you certainly

99
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
gave her one.

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:31,300
So I think she's very appreciative for that, as is anybody who is a lover of cats for sure.

101
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,940
And nothing but love coming from our chat room right now, of course.

102
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,940
Yeah.

103
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,900
And it's just still, it's getting used to, I still like, you know, as I'm sitting here

104
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,060
at my desk, I'm like, Oh, I better not, like, I better put my foot a certain way so it'll

105
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,220
kick her in the head and she's not there.

106
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,820
So it's like, it's tough.

107
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,660
And then I can't even imagine, I was like that with, with Shermy.

108
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,660
Yeah.

109
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,860
And I can't even imagine having to deal with COVID on top of all of that.

110
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,260
So just, you've, you've had a rough, I'm actually kind of surprised.

111
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
You're here.

112
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,540
You've had a rough week.

113
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,040
But I hope, I hope the show can help take your mind off it a little bit, but yeah, it's

114
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,380
been getting easier every day.

115
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,060
It's just, you know, it's tough.

116
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,540
But I'm sure our listeners, I know I do, are thankful, you know, this, this whole virtual

117
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,700
setup wasn't supposed to happen.

118
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,100
It wasn't supposed to go like this two years ago, but I'm glad that we were able to meet

119
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,780
Stella and I'm glad you were able to kind of share her with so many people throughout,

120
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
you know, the world.

121
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,140
Thanks to what we do here on Sunday nights and our little show.

122
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,880
So lots of people, lots of people feeling that in a chat.

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,980
And as Bobby Blackwolf puts it, we can shit post about video games for the next few hours

124
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,380
to take your mind off it.

125
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,580
Sounds good.

126
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,780
And SSJ100Matt with a nice thing that's kind of sums up a lot of the comments and chats

127
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,340
saying, RIP Stella, you and your family gave her a wonderful life and she shared so much

128
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
love to you guys.

129
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,340
She did the right thing.

130
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,340
Yeah.

131
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
All right.

132
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,500
Well, let's go ahead.

133
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
We're going to move on.

134
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,420
We're going to get into our kickoff topic for the night.

135
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,820
Actually, I kind of have two things.

136
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,020
I have a quick thing for the top of the show before we get into the main kickoff topic

137
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,820
that is up on the board.

138
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,020
I am sometimes I get messages from people that listen to the show and friend, you know,

139
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,180
people become my friends from the show.

140
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,700
I'm a normal person, just like everybody else out there.

141
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,400
Well, I've got problems, but don't we all I'm just normal here, right?

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,500
So like, you know, people will message me and, you know, I do try to respond best I

143
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
can.

144
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,980
I'm really bad and my husband will be the first.

145
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,900
I'm really bad about reading a message and then oops, I got distracted during something

146
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,500
else and I never get around to responding.

147
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,980
I am really bad at that, especially if you message me during the show.

148
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,060
I am trying to do something else right now, but I get DMS on Twitter.

149
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,500
I get, you know, messages on Facebook and, you know, sometimes it's questions about video

150
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,020
games or what's my hot take on a certain thing.

151
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,040
And I'll, you know, give my hot take.

152
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,960
This one though kind of made me go, ooh, I should talk about that on OLR.

153
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,740
So I got a message on Facebook that said, and I guess I can just say it's from Codeman

154
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:12,400
who used to be here live, but I guess I think he's been a listener for a long time.

155
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,060
I think he just more listens on the podcast feed these days than live.

156
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,840
So a Codeman sent me a message that was like, hey, honest question, does this Pokemon game

157
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,280
seem rushed to you?

158
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,760
And we were talking, you know, because we've talked a little bit on the show about Pokemon

159
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,940
Legends and I was talking about my review last week about my impressions and I really

160
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,200
do enjoy it as a Pokemon game.

161
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,580
And honestly, now here we are another week into it.

162
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,480
And I actually said, I need a little more time with this, but I think this might be

163
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,040
my favorite Pokemon game they've done yet.

164
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,800
And I think I'm at the point where I can say, yes, this is my favorite Pokemon game they've

165
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,040
done yet.

166
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
That doesn't mean it's without its flaws.

167
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,840
And as I pointed out last week, a lot of that is in the technical space, right?

168
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,000
It looks like a PlayStation 3 RPG with, you know, a lot of the waves, the scenery looks

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,360
and things like that.

170
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,760
And I think it just falls into the hands of the ever long running joke that Nintendo just

171
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,920
can't compete in the technological department, but especially so the Pokemon company and

172
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,500
Game Freak.

173
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,040
And it was interesting because, you know, I gave my kind of take on this and I'll give

174
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,600
it to you guys in a minute.

175
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,120
But then Codeman kind of pointed out, I've noticed that Sword and Shield look drastically

176
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,480
better graphics wise than this game.

177
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,360
That's why I asked now.

178
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,720
And I agree, Sword and Shield was a better looking game.

179
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,680
It is a little bit apple to oranges in the fact that, you know, while, yes, Sword and

180
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,840
Shield had very wide open areas, it was a very different sort of open area than I think

181
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,360
what we get in this game.

182
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,240
And I think that should be noted as to, you know,

183
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,920
Sword and Shield struggle with like some of those open areas, like didn't like wasn't

184
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,720
the game pretty solid, but like when you got to those big open areas is like kind of chugging

185
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
a bit.

186
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,860
Sometimes I think I think also docked versus handheld would play into that a little bit.

187
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,320
And I only play docked.

188
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,360
So and usually the game will stutter more in handheld.

189
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,760
I pretty much only play games in docked mode on the switch.

190
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,000
So it's hard for me.

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,960
But yes, I mean, even Sword and Shield kind of plays into the old argument of LOL, Nintendo

192
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,520
doesn't make technologically great games.

193
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,800
But then, you know, Breath of the Wild exists and it existed on the Wii U.

194
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,240
So that is very true, right?

195
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Absolutely.

196
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,720
And and, you know, folks in chat, of course, jumping right in.

197
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,640
Mike Deff says it's not perfect, but what it does, it does so good.

198
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
And I absolutely agree.

199
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,120
And again, I just said this is probably my favorite Pokemon game.

200
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,120
I mean, yes, we can kind of say technologically, it's got some issues, but you know what?

201
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,320
At the end of the day, does it really matter?

202
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,000
Eh, no, but I think a lot of us just kind of look at it.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,840
And I said this last week, but I'm going to reiterate the frustrating part is that we

204
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
look at it.

205
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,880
We see the potential because we see the, I don't know, Horizon Forbidden West of the

206
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
world.

207
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,640
We see the Forza Horizon fives of the world.

208
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,400
We see all these, actually, wait, did I just add an extra Forza Horizon game?

209
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
I think I did.

210
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
But someday there'll be a five.

211
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,640
I think I just added another game in the series.

212
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,680
We all know it's coming, but we all see the Forza Horizon series of the world and we see

213
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,000
all these games and it's like, why can't Nintendo be that?

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,960
And to quote a famous drag queen, you will never be glamour.

215
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,480
And I think Nintendo is kind of okay being that.

216
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Okay.

217
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
I'm losing track of games.

218
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Thank you, Bobby.

219
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,520
Bobby says Forza Horizon 5 is the current game.

220
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,240
I had to like count in my head.

221
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Okay.

222
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,520
Anyway, you know what I was, the point I was getting at though is that Pokemon Legends

223
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,260
Arceus isn't that.

224
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,240
It's not that in the graphical sense.

225
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,000
So the question, I want to go back to the question that Codeman raised is that does

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,720
this Pokemon game seem rushed to you?

227
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,440
And my answer is no, but, and here's the real hot take.

228
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,960
And I want to see what you all think of this hot take.

229
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:17,140
Can you rate this hot take on a scale of one to 10, 10 being like pipe and spicy hot and

230
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,560
one being like cold McDonald's fries.

231
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Okay.

232
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,120
So what do you, what do you think of this hot take and my hot take is, I don't think

233
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,800
it was rushed, but I think the scope of the game changed because I think the reason why

234
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,400
this game isn't technologically pushing the way it ought to is because it was originally

235
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,280
designed to be the launch game for the Switch Pro.

236
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,600
And when the Switch Pro suddenly didn't happen because of chip shortage, well I shouldn't

237
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,800
say suddenly didn't happen because I think that's been in the making for a while.

238
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,840
I think when it didn't happen because of chip shortages and things of that nature, they

239
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,280
decided to release the game anyway because the Pokemon games are on a timetable and what

240
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
have you.

241
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,480
But I think a Pokemon style Breath of the Wild candidate would have been the perfect

242
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,800
game to release a new type of like upgraded Switch and all that with, and I, and I think

243
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,000
maybe some more of that potential and maybe some of the stutter and things like that probably

244
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,760
would have been there on a Switch Pro.

245
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,600
And so that's my hot take is that no, I don't think it was rushed, but I think they had

246
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,240
to change it and suddenly as high as it was going to go was the Switch and there wasn't

247
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,200
going to be a Switch Pro in that situation.

248
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,160
Mike Deft in chat says, Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl was rushed.

249
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Legends RKS wasn't rushed.

250
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,080
Mike Deft says, Game Freak has never been praised for their graphics.

251
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,680
Fifth Dream in chat says, Nintendo consoles are one to five gens behind and Pokemon games

252
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,880
are half more behind than that.

253
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,280
I think that's a pretty good way to put it, summarize it there.

254
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,760
D'Artezio says, Yes, I could see that as a big franchise, but like not a big game that

255
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,640
does seem to track as launch title, right?

256
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,200
Sometimes Nintendo kind of does this with their launch titles.

257
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,880
I mean, it's not, you can't say they always do it, but like, look at the launch of the

258
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,440
GameCube.

259
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,840
Like Luigi's Mansion was kind of like their Mario game, but it wasn't really a Mario game

260
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,280
at all.

261
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,700
It was very different.

262
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,940
And so, you know, I think and plus, we know that the Switch Pro, I think, would have been

263
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,060
in mid-grade and anything that was designed for it should work on the Nintendo Switch.

264
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,740
And I think that's why this game still came out at the end of the day is because it was

265
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,820
designed to run on the Nintendo Switch, just like, you know, Breath of the Wild was designed

266
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,220
to run on the Wii U and all that stuff.

267
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,220
Zelda Twilight Princess was designed to run on the GameCube and the Nintendo Wii and all

268
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,220
that stuff.

269
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,300
I just think that it ended up at some point, we're not going to release it on a Switch

270
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,580
Pro after all.

271
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,940
I think if they do release a Switch Pro in the next year or so, I kind of don't think

272
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,020
they will at this point.

273
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:05,420
But if they do, and then suddenly this game works on it or there's a game of the year

274
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,860
edition with the rumored DLC that comes out and all that stuff, I think it almost just

275
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,180
guarantees I'm right in this situation.

276
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,820
If it doesn't happen, I still kind of want to be right, but I may not be, and that's

277
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,820
fine.

278
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,820
I realize it's a hot take.

279
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,820
S2100 Matt says, Game Freak still using the Game Boy era Pokemon growls is a troll for

280
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,260
the haters at this point.

281
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,180
Did you notice that even Pikachu and Eevee have the Game Boy growls?

282
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,900
There's not even a Pikachu in every Pokemon game.

283
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:45,380
Even on Pokemon Yellow, Pikachu went Pikachu and doesn't do it here.

284
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,540
I think that's more to try to fit in with the lore.

285
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,660
You can call it corner cutting, but I think you can say there's an argument to be made

286
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,300
about the whole, it's historical, it's the first Pokedex, it's when Pokemon were still

287
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:05,740
violent and all this stuff that maybe plays into that and why they can kind of do that.

288
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,940
Anyway, LM Orchard in chat says, How'd Pikachu go again?

289
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,940
Pikachu.

290
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Pikachu.

291
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,940
Yeah, Jamie does it better.

292
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,940
All right.

293
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,060
Well, also, Pikachu's voice actor is a lady.

294
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,220
Yes, Bulbasaur is a lady, too.

295
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,380
She was at Dragon Con one year.

296
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,560
I think several of them are ladies.

297
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,840
Not all of them, though, of course, because I think the director of the first Pokemon

298
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,680
movie or something does one of the voices of one of the Pokemon.

299
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
So, anyway.

300
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,680
All right.

301
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,120
I just want to answer that.

302
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,000
I thought it was an interesting question, and I wanted to put that hot take at the start

303
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,600
of the show.

304
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,880
Let's get to another hot take going around the gaming industry right now.

305
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,880
Rumors, rumors, rumors, although this, I don't know if I would put this in the rumor department

306
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,280
because it's more a little bit like there is smoke and potentially fire.

307
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,520
It's something that Business Insider reported on, which has a little bit more of a reputation

308
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,720
for getting things.

309
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,320
Although it's interesting, their entire site is paywalled, or at least the story is.

310
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,040
So a lot of people are having a report on the report.

311
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,320
But many game blogs are pointing out that Business Insider has run a report that says

312
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,480
Stadia has basically been demoted within Google.

313
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,440
And I want to hear what Dark Soccer thinks of this, too, as Twitch's premier Stadia streamer.

314
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,840
But I would need to see the report.

315
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,240
Let me get to some of the information that is coming out of this first.

316
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,480
Apparently, Phil Harrison, and why they're calling this a demotion, basically, Phil Harrison,

317
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,240
who is the VP, I'm sorry, Phil Harrison now reports to Google's VP of Subscription Services

318
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,520
instead of directly to Rick Osterlow, who is Google's hardware boss.

319
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,440
And I think that movement is the catalyst for this whole story in this report.

320
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,920
I think people are really running with this, and now you want to talk about hot takes.

321
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,480
You're seeing the hot takes on Twitter where people are already eulogizing Stadia.

322
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm not sure it's quite that.

323
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,160
In fact, I think we're quite a ways away from that.

324
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,500
However, the report goes on to say, the reason for this is disappointing sales and performing

325
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,080
far below Google's expectations.

326
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,600
Google Stadia will now be focusing on lucrative deals with other companies to create and power

327
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,540
experiences for them.

328
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,860
Folks are talking about a deal with Peloton Bikes, which I think is very interesting,

329
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,140
and it's going to be powered by Google Stream, which people are saying is just Google Stadia

330
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,660
under a different name.

331
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,240
It's the same technology.

332
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,740
Very interesting.

333
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:49,140
But I guess now only about 20% focus at Stadia is on the gaming side as was before, and this

334
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,820
is according to an insider who gossiped to, appropriately, Business Insider.

335
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,420
What's also interesting about this and what lends the Business Insider report to some

336
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,860
credibility potentially is that Google Stadia kind of responded, but they responded with

337
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,920
their tongue in their cheek with a tweet that said, if you hear one thing, hear this.

338
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,940
The Stadia team is working really hard on a great future for Stadia and cloud gaming.

339
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,780
We hope you agree, and we know the proof is in the playing.

340
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,140
The source went on to talk to Business Insider saying, there are plenty of people internally

341
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,140
who would love to keep it going, so they are working really hard to make sure it doesn't

342
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,060
die, but they're not the ones writing the checks.

343
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
It doesn't seem like-

344
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,940
I'm reading the Business Insider article right now.

345
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
Oh, fun.

346
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,420
I'll get your take on that in just a moment.

347
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Let me get a couple-

348
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,540
Yeah, for the record, if you ever want to get past a paywall, go to archive.js and put

349
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,620
in the URL, and it should load it up.

350
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,220
There you go.

351
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,380
Apparently, Google will not probably pull the plug on Stadia anytime soon, but it's

352
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,060
just kind of playing into the whole- Google didn't really play off as much as they wanted.

353
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,940
So I don't think they're going to shut Stadia down tomorrow or anything like that, but here's

354
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
what it is.

355
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,160
And then I definitely want to let Jamie have a say here as our Stadia expert, I guess.

356
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,100
What it is, is this is just playing right into the hands of a lot of people that when

357
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,940
Stadia launched, they said, Google's going to treat this like they do everything else.

358
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,160
They're going to give it two years to be successful, and if it doesn't, they're going to cut it

359
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,400
off at the kneecaps, just like all these other things they launch.

360
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,960
And so people are now reading this, and even though they're not really hearing- Google

361
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,440
Stadia is not being shut down, it's just being deprioritized.

362
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,080
Everybody's kind of going, well, we all knew that's what was going to happen.

363
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
Here it is.

364
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,720
That's not at all what I think this is saying.

365
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Go ahead.

366
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Just looking this over.

367
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,200
What's your take on this?

368
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:53,280
What I think is happening is that they're branching out the technology for Stadia.

369
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Stadia isn't going anywhere.

370
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
They're still supporting it.

371
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
They're still bringing stuff out.

372
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,280
They just actually had a big sale for the Capcom licenses.

373
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,460
I just got the deluxe Resident Evil Village for like 40 bucks.

374
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,420
So they're still pushing on it.

375
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,860
What I think it is is that they're licensing the technology to get more out of it.

376
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,700
I mean, yeah, they've lost some money on it, but it still has a very dedicated user base.

377
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:29,940
And again, for people like me who play on a Mac, for example, it's a better alternative

378
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,960
in my book to using the NVIDIA service.

379
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,020
I don't want to use the NVIDIA service, I mean, because it just hasn't worked out as

380
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,040
well for me.

381
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:52,520
That being said, I think that they're trying to confirm their own bias is what I think

382
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,240
is happening.

383
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,120
And so that's why the Stadia crew had to go in and do damage control, because if anyone

384
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,480
is going to know if it's going to continue or how it's going to be supported, it's going

385
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,060
to be the people that are behind it, right?

386
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,180
And they say that there's some things coming out that they can't talk about, but it does

387
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,060
make it seem like there's going to be new titles and maybe even new services.

388
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:25,060
And they're already talking about UI improvements, like having ways to sort through your games

389
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,220
and having a different type.

390
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,140
They just added in the search feature.

391
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,860
They've really been stepping up the interface for Stadia.

392
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:45,280
Now I'm really reading this more, especially since Google tried to work with Bungie and

393
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,120
we're even looking at acquiring them before Sony stepped in.

394
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,080
We'll get to that.

395
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,820
And on top of that, they also worked with AT&T to allow people to stream Batman Arkham

396
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,240
Knight directly through the web browser.

397
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:12,440
But Google's branding wasn't on it, but AT&T definitely said it's running on Stadia's technology.

398
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,040
So I think that they're looking to branch out their streaming technology to other services

399
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:24,120
like Peloton or maybe other developers to have their stuff out.

400
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:32,120
They've even pitched using Stadia services as beta testing for PC games that are going

401
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,380
to be coming in, PC, Mac games, whatever, that are going to be coming out.

402
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:43,920
So that's what I'm reading into this, especially with bringing up the information about branching

403
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
out like that.

404
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,500
I really do think of it as a branching out.

405
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,240
I think it wasn't a big priority because Google's always been like, if it's not an

406
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,740
overnight success, then it's not a success and need to learn to play the longevity game.

407
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,380
On top of that too, there's been plenty of companies that have just absolutely adopted

408
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,140
the service and find it very useful.

409
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:19,340
I don't want to be alarmist and I don't want to believe any kind of hype until I see a

410
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,500
official word from the official people.

411
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,340
I'll take all of this with a grain of salt, but what I'm translating this to is just that

412
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,480
they're going to be expanding that technology and using it in different ways so the gaming

413
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,460
platform may not seem like it's getting as much attention.

414
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,740
I think it's going to be getting as much attention, but other aspects of it will be getting attention

415
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,140
as well.

416
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,820
I'm of two minds with this and I think a lot of what you say really does hit the nail on

417
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,700
the head because I do think Google is certainly...

418
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:53,380
Why limit the streaming technology to gaming when there's other spaces where it makes sense

419
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,560
to grow this technology into such as like the Peloton thing is actually kind of interesting

420
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:04,540
to me and whatever else might be in the future for mobile and these sorts of things, absolutely.

421
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't think we should be eulogizing Stadia by any means at this point and I think a lot

422
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,500
of that is still very premature and I think there are very exciting uses like you talk

423
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,560
about like the betas and being able to preview things without necessarily downloading something

424
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,240
to your computer where pirates can get in there and data mine, or excuse me, hackers

425
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,700
whatever can get in there and data mine things.

426
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,840
That actually should be a very lucrative thing for companies to want to get into I would

427
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,880
think.

428
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,400
Go ahead with your quote because I do have a however with this because I do think there

429
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,480
is something we have to realize, but go ahead.

430
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,640
Patrick Sabled who is a Google spokesperson, I'm just going to read this verbatim.

431
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,960
We announced our intention of helping publishers and partners deliver games directly to gamers

432
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,480
last year and we have been working toward that.

433
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,160
The first manifestation has been our partnership with AT&T who is offering Batman Arkham Knight

434
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,440
available to their customers for free.

435
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,280
While we won't be commenting on any rumors or speculation regarding other industry partners,

436
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,440
we are still focused on bringing great games to Stadia in 2022.

437
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,280
With 200 plus titles available, we expect to have another hundred plus games added to

438
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:19,400
the platform this year and currently have 50 games available to claim in Stadia Pro.

439
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:26,380
So getting into my however, I do think that Google is taking a focus off of gaming a little

440
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,620
bit and what the original intent was behind Stadia and I think you know the reorganization

441
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,160
makes that very clear.

442
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I think the fact that they kind of stopped, you know, they canceled the games that they

443
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,280
were making, they sold off the, you know, whatever they were, they don't really have

444
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,800
any exclusives in-house anymore and I really think they stopped signing the deals to get

445
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,840
the exclusives outside as well.

446
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,360
So I think this whole idea that like Google Stadia is a console that's going to compete

447
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,880
with Xbox and Switch and the trick is it's not actually a console, it's just there in

448
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,880
the cloud.

449
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,360
I think that whole image that we've had in our minds, that ain't it anymore and that's

450
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
what it is.

451
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,760
And to be honest, in my opinion, that was all missed messaging from the very beginning.

452
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:22,800
And quite honestly, I think the biggest problem in Stadia's pocket right now, I don't think

453
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,400
Phil Harrison is a very good leader.

454
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,880
I just don't think he's, I think he's misfired the messaging on this from the very beginning.

455
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,200
I don't think he's very good for the company.

456
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,320
It's like he has a history of doing this.

457
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Exactly.

458
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,800
I think Phil Harrison is the problem.

459
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,000
And what's going to be interesting, I will bet, I will bet money he leaves within the

460
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
next year.

461
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He's gone.

462
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,320
And people are going to use that to further eulogize Stadia when in fact that would actually

463
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,560
probably be the best possible thing that could happen to the platform in my opinion.

464
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,800
Can you go join the Amico team?

465
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,240
Not going there.

466
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,160
But I, it's interesting because I think if you were to go back to when this was first

467
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,200
announced, I was very apprehensive about cloud gaming, you know, and I was very much like,

468
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,520
I don't think this is the right thing.

469
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,400
There's too many bandwidth caps.

470
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,960
There's too many, you know, restrictions.

471
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,360
How is somebody going to play 4K 60 frames a second?

472
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,400
And that was my, my frame of thought.

473
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,000
I'll admit that.

474
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,280
It honestly wasn't until on this program, Dark Soccer was saying, this is a way for

475
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,840
me to play shit on my Mac that I started to go, huh?

476
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,360
And then Cyberpunk 2077 comes out and the best experience for that game is on Google

477
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,520
Stadia.

478
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,200
And I started to go, huh?

479
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,040
And now I'm hearing about these betas and doesn't it make sense to do that more for

480
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,480
the cloud and so forth.

481
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,060
And I'm really starting to go, interesting.

482
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:06,440
So I think I've really warmed up to the idea of what this cloud and how it fits into gaming's

483
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
future.

484
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,080
And I do think cloud gaming to some extent is going to be in the future of games.

485
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,600
And I've said this before on the show is I've kind of been making this transition in my

486
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,500
own thinking is that as 5G gets more and more popular, as more and more people work

487
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,720
from home and cable companies and so forth get challenged on their data bandwidth caps

488
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,940
as we get more and more connected and so on and so on.

489
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,480
And I'm talking about things that happen 10 years from now.

490
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,640
I'm not talking about things that happen next year or the year after.

491
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,220
I'm talking about the long game people.

492
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,800
I'm talking about OLR in our 50s.

493
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Okay.

494
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,280
Cloud gaming, I think there is.

495
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,640
And that's why so many people are getting into it in very different ways.

496
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,400
And now you have, and this ended up being, I think a bit of an issue for Google as well.

497
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,040
Google gets into it, Amazon gets into it, Microsoft gets into it, Nvidia gets into it.

498
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,960
I mean, there are a lot of cloud gaming solutions right now.

499
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,560
And I think the person that's playing the game the best, in my opinion, not from a technological

500
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,240
perspective, but from a marketing perspective is Microsoft.

501
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,040
And the reason why I say that is because they're not trying to like make a big deal of it.

502
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,520
They're making it an option and they're subtly, it's like they're putting it on a plate and

503
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,280
they're subtly nudging it in front of somebody.

504
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,320
Here, eat this.

505
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,800
You already have this Microsoft game pass.

506
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,200
Did you know you can play all of these games on the cloud?

507
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,600
Just click here to start that.

508
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,160
Here, eat this.

509
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,640
Whereas I think the problem that Stadia was challenged with and the messaging I think

510
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,920
they misfired on was the whole, you've got to fucking have this.

511
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,560
Cloud gaming is the future.

512
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,120
And Stadia, you can play it on a Chromecast and all that stuff, even though it's not going

513
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
to launch that way.

514
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,440
And it's not going to look that way for like six months into it and so forth.

515
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,240
But I sort of think Microsoft is playing the long game on that.

516
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,920
And I think that's going to be successful for them.

517
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,600
And again, I'm not saying that Stadia is going to fail, but I think Stadia misfired.

518
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,800
And I think it's Phil Harrison's fault.

519
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,640
Well, I did sign up for Amazon's service.

520
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,680
Luna is the beta for it.

521
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:28,440
And I'm really looking to see how it compares, you know.

522
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,520
So I'm still going to stay with Stadia as long as I can until I get my PC rebuilt and

523
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,320
then can just play Dead by Daylight on Steam.

524
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:45,200
Well, because I think that because my accounts linked all of my achievements and whatever

525
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,400
and my hours will transfer over, I hope.

526
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:55,240
But that's pretty much the thing I'm playing on Stadia that and I was playing Cyberpunk,

527
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,440
but I'm going to play Resident Evil, although I have other ideas for things I'm going to

528
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
play now.

529
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Yeah.

530
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,400
But I mean, I don't think your crown as the premier Stadia streamer on Twitch is going

531
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,520
to go anywhere anytime soon because I think Stadia is staying around for a little bit.

532
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,160
But I just don't think we're going to see Stadia exclusives or, you know, I don't think

533
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,040
we're going to see a narrative really pushed where like Stadia is this.

534
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,480
I think it's just going to it's going to be there and it's a thing that exists and it's

535
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,280
a thing that you can buy games on.

536
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:33,840
And another way to do it, I think, is is kind of what what it is at this point.

537
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,720
Interesting perspective from Fifth Dream in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network

538
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,100
who says this stuff is this stuff now is like VR in the 90s.

539
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,120
It didn't take off on the first go, but eventually will accept it and it will be taken for granted.

540
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
Interesting.

541
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,640
You know, the graphics and VR weren't all that in the beginning.

542
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,920
And I think a lot of that had to catch up a bit to make it because now everybody thinks

543
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,960
of 90s VR and they think of that movie, The Lawnmower Man, and you go back and you watch

544
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,400
that movie now and it's like, fuck, this was ridiculous.

545
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,240
But that's that's what VR kind of look like in the 90s.

546
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Right.

547
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,960
For those of us that lived it.

548
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,480
But now it's very different.

549
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,080
So I haven't thought movie in an age.

550
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,280
I think most people have it.

551
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
All right.

552
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,120
Anyway, let's go ahead and move on.

553
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,640
We're going to talk about our gaming weeks.

554
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,720
Let's talk about how is your gaming week?

555
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,540
We'll move over to Dark Sakura and I'll start with you.

556
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,040
How is your gaming week?

557
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Productive.

558
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Yeah.

559
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,840
I played Mass Effect 2.

560
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Nice.

561
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,800
On through Windows 11 ARM.

562
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,400
And it it had like right at first it had some syncing issues.

563
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,240
And then after that, it was fine.

564
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,380
I even got my old save files to work.

565
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,660
The thing is that the the first Mass Effect save files will not work.

566
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,920
And you know, I imported like some of my old favorites.

567
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,480
I'm probably going to start the game over and live stream it, I think.

568
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,120
But I've I've I had fun with it.

569
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,560
Now the only other things that I'm trying to do is that like the save file editor, it

570
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,120
will not run in this version of Windows.

571
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,040
So I have to find something else.

572
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,440
But but so far, I mean, it's it's the game I love and remember, you know, had a good

573
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
time with it.

574
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,480
It looks good.

575
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,840
There's already high res textures for it, like even more high res.

576
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,400
So I'm I'm just enjoying I'm enjoying it, you know, I'm playing and of course, playing

577
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,720
copious amounts of Dead by Daylight.

578
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,720
I'm kind of like, it's something that like goes off in my brain that the moment I hit

579
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,440
like silver ranks, I'm just sort of like, okay, I don't care anymore.

580
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,900
I'm just gonna play, you know, meme around with people like.

581
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,880
I don't know how this came about.

582
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:02,920
But when I was playing last night, I was in like the the airy, the the crow ladies area.

583
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,580
And it was his arena just standing there.

584
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,580
And I was playing Freddy.

585
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,540
And we just both nodded at each other and then went in different directions and ended

586
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:18,060
up that like, there was another fuck, what's her name from Halloween, Laurie, Laurie.

587
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,060
Yeah, there was a Laurie there and I was playing her normal.

588
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,940
And then I guess she and the arena player were friends or something.

589
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,700
But then we just sort of just played around and we, you know, farmed the generators a

590
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
little bit.

591
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,380
And I let Laurie out and then Serena showed me the hatch and I closed the hatch and then

592
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,380
Serena left.

593
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,620
So it was just like a funny little game.

594
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,000
And then I had like a mid, you know, a mid game boop match.

595
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,700
I've just been having fun because like people are are being, you know, salty and sweaty

596
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,220
and just taking things too seriously.

597
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,380
And last night I just gave a shit.

598
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:55,900
I just wanted to play, you know, play around, let people know there's another person here.

599
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,420
But I've started doing something in my postgame chat that actually has made my experience

600
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,420
in the game a lot better.

601
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,060
And that's just saying, hey, I had fun.

602
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,300
Have a great evening.

603
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,060
You know, even if someone was a shit, you know, you know, I might say, well, what was

604
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,340
this like, like I had a Jane player last night, there's, you know, when you go into the basement

605
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:25,380
and the stairs turn to the side, there's a corner there that if someone's not down, it

606
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,380
will clip them into that corner and you can't pick them up until I basically worked until

607
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,860
I picked her up and got her there.

608
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,900
You know, that was the only comment I said was like, you know, other than that exploit

609
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,060
by the Jane player, you know, I had fun.

610
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,460
I mean, I didn't do, you know, don't win or anything.

611
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,180
I was playing huntress.

612
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,820
I'm not good at her, but I had a fun time.

613
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:50,580
And I'll make sure that I want people to leave a game that they're playing with me having

614
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,700
a good experience.

615
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,540
I think a lot of people just say GGWP, but I think because you see that so often, it

616
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,180
kind of loses its meaning.

617
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,020
It's desensitized, right?

618
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,380
Yeah.

619
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:08,220
And so for me, I'm just like, you know, Hey, I had a good time, you know, good game.

620
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,180
It was, you know, but the big thing is me just saying, have a good night.

621
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,860
And it changes the entire conversation instead of a, Oh, you got shitted on or whatever.

622
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,540
Like, it was like, I just flat out instead of, you know, someone started with that and

623
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,940
they said, Oh, just were you having an off night?

624
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,780
Like, yeah, I was just, you know, memeing around and like, Oh, okay, that's cool.

625
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,460
You know, well, better luck next time.

626
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,580
I was like, yeah, you have a good one.

627
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:38,220
Made, I even found a person that I got on two different characters on two different

628
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,740
matches.

629
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,860
So I rated them.

630
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:47,660
Now here's how many bits dark Sakura for you to start off that chat very nice and pleasant.

631
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,220
And then at the end say, now go get shit on.

632
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,740
Good night.

633
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,300
How many bits to get you to tell someone to go fuck themselves?

634
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,260
I do it for 2,500 bits.

635
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,020
All right.

636
00:37:59,300 --> 00:37:59,820
Noted.

637
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,180
Noted.

638
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,100
I'll do it.

639
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,300
I'll do it.

640
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,940
You should put that as a channel.

641
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,980
I guess that's not actual money.

642
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,140
It was channel points reward.

643
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,220
Like 50,000 points get shit on.

644
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,540
No, I know, I know.

645
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,020
What's it makes me think of losing colors.

646
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,220
Uh, GG easy.

647
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:21,740
What used to be like his big premier reward, like for him to say GG easy was like 50,000

648
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,660
points or something.

649
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,500
But, um, I think because the, the context of the game has changed a little bit, he reduced

650
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,540
the number of points you needed for that, but yeah.

651
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,900
Well, I spend all of my points on one thing and one thing only, and that's the, uh, rate

652
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,660
my, uh, rate, my cosmetics.

653
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,740
And I don't even know what it is.

654
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,100
Cause you know, the only reason I have survivors anymore is to play dress up with them, but

655
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,220
people like my outfits.

656
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,940
I guess I have good fashion sense in game.

657
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,380
Who knows?

658
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,940
For me, I hardly ever redeemed channel points because I'm always saving for the biggest

659
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,500
e-ticket item I'm saving for VIP.

660
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,900
Uh, you know, or the, you get a sound command and introduction every time you come in here

661
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,060
and that those types of high ticket rewards, VIP shout out and a sound command and Nick's

662
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,420
channel.

663
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,140
Um, I have VIP in droves, hydro.

664
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:19,140
And I think I got it in Isaaco and then Elsie just gave it to me like early on.

665
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:26,460
So, but I, but I mean, but if I, if I'm in somebody's channel that much, I want to be

666
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,300
I want to be productive and help them out and promote them while I'm there, you know?

667
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:39,900
So, um, I'm still though, I think I put play survivor as my high level redeem and mine.

668
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,940
Although I might, I might play tonight.

669
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,580
If I get people to play with me, I have to get people to play with me.

670
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,660
I'm I might be on, we'll see.

671
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,620
All right.

672
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,420
Well, the other, the other stuff I played, of course, I played word scapes, um, played

673
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,900
Star Trek pinball here at my house.

674
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,780
Um, and I am getting things ready.

675
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,020
If the, the, uh, tool that I'm using to play it on works, I'm probably going to start

676
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,780
streaming a link to the past.

677
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,980
Oh, fun for like a retro game night.

678
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,980
Um, other than that, like I said, you know, Sam going to, Oh, and Fantasian, of course,

679
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,340
which I actually beat a boss that had been giving me fits before and I beat it pretty

680
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:22,780
readily.

681
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,460
So it was, it was really cool.

682
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,300
Nice.

683
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,380
Yeah.

684
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,540
All right, let's move on to Loki.

685
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,580
How was your gaming week, Loki?

686
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,460
Uh, I'm playing Minecraft and more, more power washing sim.

687
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,300
Good times.

688
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,460
Well, you've had a week, so comfort food games like those, comfort, comfort food games

689
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,580
like those go a long way.

690
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,020
I'm sure.

691
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,060
Dude, someone should just bring you a pot of macaroni and cheese.

692
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,780
That's not a game.

693
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,380
It should be comfort.

694
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,180
It is comfort.

695
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,020
What's better than video games and eating a pot of macaroni and cheese by yourself?

696
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,700
Mmm.

697
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,180
Coffee.

698
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,620
I don't know.

699
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,300
I don't know.

700
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,900
But yeah, I've just been working on, um, the Minecraft stuff.

701
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:12,180
Um, I filmed a little bit of this week and then I started to edit it down, but yeah, new

702
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,980
episode comes in.

703
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,660
Speaking of, by the way, before I get to my gaming week, uh, since channel point rewards

704
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,980
got brought up and mac and cheese, um, we do need to schedule orange lounge foodie-o.

705
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,300
I, uh, I know it was, it was delayed for several months because of some things I'm going through.

706
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,740
Um, actually I do have a small update in that department.

707
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:35,580
Um, I had, um, uh, update, uh, check on what's called your A1C, which is basically like your

708
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,900
average blood sugar over a two to three month period.

709
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,620
And, uh, I dropped that number by over three points down to, uh, basically a level that

710
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,260
would be considered more pre-diabetic.

711
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,220
So that's pretty exciting.

712
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:51,340
Uh, and my doctor actually said in the email to me, you are doing amazing, which is a nice

713
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,460
thing to hear from your doctor.

714
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:58,300
So, um, that was a very nice, I mean, it's, it's come with some work and, uh, I'm, I'm third.

715
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,820
You maybe you've noticed my, a little bit, cause now I'm getting to the point where like I see

716
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,660
it, some of my weight loss, but I've come down 30 pounds, uh, than where I was last summer.

717
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,060
So, uh, it's been, it's been an adventure.

718
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,660
Thank you.

719
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,300
Thank you.

720
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,060
Uh, it's more about, more about my health than my looks, but.

721
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,820
If I can get you to do weight training with me, that'd be awesome.

722
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:23,100
Well, the nice thing is the new place I'm moving to has like a clubhouse with a gym that we get

723
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,940
access to.

724
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,620
So, and that I feel better, a little better about that than going to a place like, you know, 24

725
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,220
hour, you know, any of those big clubs, because, you know, right now with COVID still, that's a

726
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,420
little more exclusive.

727
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,780
So it's a higher chance I can get in there when it's just me or one other person.

728
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,580
So, um, that'll be easy.

729
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,540
I can, I can do more than just walk.

730
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,780
And I think in my routine, cause Omicron's kind of kept me from the gym during this whole time.

731
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,060
Um, otherwise I would have started working that into my routine.

732
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,060
So, yeah.

733
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:56,740
Uh, anyway, my gaming week and other things, uh, honestly, my gaming week this week looks almost

734
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,020
exactly like last week.

735
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,180
A lot of the same games.

736
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,060
I'm still playing a diverse amount of stuff.

737
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,140
I'm playing Final Fantasy 14 as I usually do.

738
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,180
I'm also continuing Dead by Daylight.

739
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,380
I had a bit of an opposite week than Dark Sakura.

740
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,980
I was, oh, just, just solo queue is so draining.

741
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,220
I rage quit on Monday or Tuesday night.

742
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,780
Like I just, I was getting tunneled.

743
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,380
I was getting left on the hook.

744
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,700
I died on first hook, uh, more than once.

745
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,940
Like it was just really irritating stuff.

746
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,060
And, uh, I like even Alan heard me go like, fuck this game.

747
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,820
Or I just was like really upset.

748
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:36,220
Uh, but then of course, like a dummy, I went back to it yesterday and I was like, all right, maybe this isn't so bad.

749
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,020
MMR finally put me in a lower bracket or something and it was a little more manageable.

750
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,580
That sounds like an abusive relationship.

751
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,940
Pretty much, pretty much, honestly.

752
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,820
Um, so there was that as well.

753
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,820
Uh, and then, uh, Pokemon Legends Arceus.

754
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:57,540
I've, uh, got past the second area in that and the boss there, uh, which I know some of you will probably already beaten the game and you've gotten through much further than I have.

755
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:07,140
But I think there's a lot of people like me who are playing it very slowly and exploring the areas and catching all the Pokemon and getting items and all that stuff.

756
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,500
So, um, I'm still really enjoying that game.

757
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,940
It's, uh, it's great.

758
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,140
We talked about that a lot at the top of the show though, so I won't add a lot to that.

759
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,700
Uh, still played some Taiko no Tatsujin.

760
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,980
I bought my first song.

761
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,900
I also did my first online match, which I lost, which was bullshit because the other guy didn't get a full combo.

762
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,780
I did, but I had more OKs.

763
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,380
Um, but I was able to calibrate my TV and it's a little better.

764
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,260
Um, but I guess I'm still not hitting as exact.

765
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,180
Whatever.

766
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,060
Uh, the game is still kind of fun, I guess.

767
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,340
Yeah, the, the song I bought was like old school.

768
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:46,940
I think it was called Namcott Melody, uh, because it was old school Namco games, like all mishmashed together.

769
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:53,500
It was like the Pac-Man interlude, then the Mappy interlude, then like, you know, it's just like a bunch of stuff, like all kind of mishmashed together.

770
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,140
It was really cute.

771
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:59,100
So, um, but yeah, all that stuff together was pretty much my gaming week.

772
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,020
Played a little bit here and a little bit there.

773
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,140
All right.

774
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,980
Uh, let's move into some other gaming news.

775
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,580
Uh, just a reminder though, there will be no live show or podcast in two weeks.

776
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:22,180
Because next week is, uh, the last show in this house with the studio and I'm moving and then, uh, yeah, it's going to be going to be a fresh coat of paint when we get to episode 904, uh, in a few weeks.

777
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,620
So, um, yeah, but we will be here next week.

778
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,660
I realize next week is a big, silly football game that a lot of people pay attention to.

779
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:36,620
Uh, usually there's a big important concert with that as well, but they decided to go a different route this year than a big diva.

780
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,980
Well, I guess they have Mary J.

781
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,380
Blige.

782
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,140
That's kind of neat.

783
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:49,060
But, um, I'm not, I'm not as excited as I was with say Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira.

784
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,180
It's Gaga.

785
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:56,660
It's not quite that, uh, it's a different concert this year and, and the little, uh, game they play around the concert.

786
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:01,620
Um, but just, just to be clear, that doesn't deter us from doing our show.

787
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,820
We will still be here next Sunday.

788
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,180
Usually I think that we will report on the puppy bowl.

789
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,140
Uh, yes.

790
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,660
Is that still going on this year?

791
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,860
I guess it must be still doing the puppy bowl.

792
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,700
When wouldn't it be?

793
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,180
I don't know.

794
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:12,980
All right.

795
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,780
So, yeah, and like D'Artez uses in chat, it's usually kind of over by then anyway.

796
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,340
Yes.

797
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:25,340
So, um, as 200 Matt says, I envision off camera, Rob is surrounded by boxes and a massive Tetris like pattern.

798
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,340
Not quite yet.

799
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,100
Uh, but maybe next week it'll be a little more like, I would imagine next week.

800
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,060
It's not the studio is not like all this stuff on the wall is going to be down.

801
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,300
Uh, it's going to look very different in here.

802
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:40,900
Uh, so, uh, yeah, but, um, probably not right now.

803
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,580
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf does point out that he will not be here next week.

804
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:55,140
Uh, cause he has a small gathering of folks for, um, the, the little, uh, uh, concert and a side of game that happens next week.

805
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,820
Uh, and speaking of food, that's the other big deal about those types of things.

806
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:06,100
You, you go to see your friends, uh, and, uh, it's all about the potluck and teeny weenies.

807
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,700
That's basically what it is.

808
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,140
It's, uh, next week is a celebration of teeny weenies.

809
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,260
All right.

810
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,980
Glad they get their day.

811
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,740
Let's move on.

812
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,340
Uh, let's get to our big headline of the week.

813
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,180
Uh, Loki.

814
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:28,740
So Sony has decided to go ahead and purchase bungee for $3.6 billion.

815
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:43,300
Um, now, unlike Activision, Blizzard, or any, like some of the other acquisitions have been happening recently, they are still going to be remaining an independent subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment.

816
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:48,100
And also they're going to be publishing games on multi-platform.

817
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,820
So not just PlayStation exclusives.

818
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,940
Of course, you know, that can all change down the road.

819
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,220
We'll have to wait and see.

820
00:47:54,220 --> 00:48:00,820
But for right now, they are committing to at least, um, publishing on other platforms.

821
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,580
So that's good.

822
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:09,420
Um, along with that, Sony has been spending, um, money to keep the devs from leaving.

823
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:21,580
So they've spent $1.2 billion of that to, I guess, you know, keep the staff that are there, um, that are working on Destiny 2 from leaving.

824
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,180
So, and that'll be paid out over several years.

825
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:43,940
So that's very smart, uh, to make sure you pay to keep the talent and not just, you know, cause if you look at Microsoft and Activision and that whole thing, people have been abandoning ship at Activision left and right and Blizzard and all that because of, um, that, you know, dumb fuck who's leading the company right now.

826
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:56,620
Uh, I'm not talking about Microsoft who has an intelligent, uh, man that's leading the company, but I'm talking about, uh, people abandoning ship at ABK because of the dumb fuck that's running things over there, uh, who, uh, shouldn't have a job anymore.

827
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,620
But I digress.

828
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,780
My point is it's very smart of Sony to really pay to keep the talent here.

829
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:13,780
Uh, because, uh, yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't know if like Sony has this bad stigma or whatever, where people would be looking to run, but they might be looking to run because they, they fear like the corporate.

830
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,060
You know what, whatever it is, or it doesn't match their vision or what have you.

831
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,340
Yeah, I suppose.

832
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,780
I mean, it's still good to keep your talent around.

833
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,580
And right now what they have planned is more live service games.

834
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,380
I mean, that's what destiny is, I guess.

835
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:29,900
So.

836
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,420
Well, and it makes sense for Sony to have something like that.

837
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,540
God, a war isn't that horizon isn't that.

838
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,900
So it, it makes sense for them to have something in their pocket.

839
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,140
You know what I think happened?

840
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:47,260
Um, because a lot of folks are saying this is a response to Microsoft buying Activision.

841
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,420
No, no.

842
00:49:49,420 --> 00:50:05,900
First off, if you're, if you're, um, if you're a gaming analyst or gaming commentator has come to that conclusion, that ought to be one of those red flag emojis because real talk, um, this conversation had to be in talks a long time ago.

843
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,580
So this started well before the news that Microsoft.

844
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:16,940
Now, you don't know who talks to who and maybe Sony picks some stuff, but I highly doubt any of that came into play.

845
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,900
This was something that happened independent of that.

846
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:23,740
It is simply interesting that Bungie was a Microsoft company.

847
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,860
Then they weren't.

848
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,980
Then they were an Activision company.

849
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,100
Then they weren't.

850
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,980
And they after the Activision thing, they were like, we're never getting into another relationship.

851
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,820
And, you know, if Bobby Kotick was your CEO, fuck, I'd be pretty scarred, too.

852
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:41,020
But now here we are, they're getting into a relationship again with Sony.

853
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,620
That is interesting.

854
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:48,140
Their trajectory, but, um, and it certainly has nothing to do with the Mike Microsoft Activision thing.

855
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,060
Yeah, these are, these are Ms says it's had to be in the works for at least six months.

856
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,220
Exactly.

857
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:53,620
Exactly.

858
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,900
And it's possible too, that it still could have been somewhat in response with that.

859
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,580
Cause you know, you don't know who was talking to Activision to purchase them.

860
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:06,380
Maybe Sony and Microsoft knew that, you know, one had interest for the others or something like that.

861
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:13,100
So it could be possible that, you know, some of that cause sparked it, but no, it's not like, you know,

862
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:18,460
Microsoft purchased Activision and they're like, well, we got to go buy somebody let's buy a bungee.

863
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,300
Thankfully they didn't say Konami.

864
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,980
That's not worth the money.

865
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,340
Um, they would have gotten it significantly cheaper.

866
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,420
I'll take $1.

867
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,620
At least get the Silent Hill IP from the 99 cent store.

868
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,300
Jesus.

869
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,220
Oh gosh.

870
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:38,380
Off offer the offer to buy an NFT of the Silent Hill franchise with Konami.

871
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,340
Maybe they'll fall for it.

872
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,980
Um, actually, wait quickly though.

873
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:56,540
The, the one thing with, um, uh, bungee and Activision and all that, I think, uh, well, with PlayStation and why they bought bungee, I think, you know, because PlayStation does get to see things that bungee's working on before anyone else does.

874
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,460
And they get to see this.

875
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:11,860
I mean, there's confidentiality agreements, there's, you know, all sorts of things, but how do you think that like, okay, Sony secured the rights for an exclusive map to destiny when it first came out or destiny to, I don't remember which one of those, I got the exclusive map for.

876
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:20,260
They had that whole thing, you know, so they they've had a relationship with bungee for a bit and they get to see these games months in advance to plan that marketing thing.

877
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,340
And, oh, we're going to invest these dollars.

878
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:29,860
So my thought is Sony saw something, whatever's bungee's working on now, and they were like, we have to have this.

879
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:43,820
We don't want anyone else having this, but us, um, or this is something that makes sense with our Sony and PC platform, as I'll tell you, it's going to be PC as well, but it'll be a Sony and PC type of title.

880
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,740
Uh, it makes sense with their strategy.

881
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,780
So I think that is why Sony bought bungee.

882
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:54,180
Oh, you want to, you want to know another red flag for your, uh, video game commentators?

883
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,060
I'm just going to tell it like it is an analyst.

884
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:08,260
If the next question that they're debating on their articles, their podcast or whatever is who's Nintendo going to buy red flag, emoji, red flag, emoji, not flag emoji.

885
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,660
I haven't heard of that studio.

886
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,180
Did we should totally start that studio?

887
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,580
It's right.

888
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,380
Right.

889
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:20,260
Uh, Nintendo, Nintendo is not rule number one.

890
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:27,900
And a thing you should come to realize a long time ago, Nintendo doesn't play the same game as the others in the room.

891
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:42,420
And also, why would Nintendo need to buy a studio to make more exclusive games when nobody is making exclusive games as good as Nintendo?

892
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,420
Some people are going to take issue with what I just said, but I fucking said it.

893
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,620
Nintendo is making the exclusives.

894
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,380
That's why everybody always goes, where, where, why won't Sony buy Nintendo?

895
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,740
Where, where, why can't we have Pokemon legends on PlayStation five?

896
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:04,820
Where, where, because, because Nintendo is making the games y'all want to play.

897
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:08,900
And that's the, it's that, that's the fact they don't need to buy a studio to make games.

898
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,580
They've got studios to make games.

899
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:16,380
They're only going to buy the things that make sense with their French vanilla fantasies.

900
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,580
That's, that's, that's it.

901
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:25,820
They're only going to buy the studios that are already marching in tandem with them and already kind of pretty much a part of the family and so forth.

902
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,540
They're not, Nintendo ain't fucking buying Sega.

903
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,660
They're not going to buy Konami.

904
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,580
They're not, Nintendo is just going to keep making Nintendo games.

905
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,980
So that's it.

906
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,780
Yeah, orange right in chat says Nintendo does what Nintendo does.

907
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,820
Yes, that.

908
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:51,260
Tiger Claw says Nintendo owns a couple studios of their own that develop only on their platform.

909
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,540
Tiger Claw points out Retro Studios, the Pokemon company to name a few.

910
00:54:54,660 --> 00:55:01,540
Yes, companies that worked with them for a while on titles and were already kind of making games for Nintendo.

911
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:10,340
And it just made sense to be in, Hal Laboratories is another, there you go, that just makes sense to be in lockstep with them and where those acquisitions make sense.

912
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:15,700
Nintendo fucking coming out of left field and plunking down a bunch of cash for Sega, not Nintendo's game.

913
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:23,620
So I'm just, I'm just saying I would be, I mean, fuck, it's 2022 and we've all lived in this pandemic era.

914
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,020
Nothing should surprise us anymore.

915
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:32,180
So you know what, if I have to sit here and eat crow because Nintendo does end up buying someone big, then you know what?

916
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:39,740
Fuck it. Get me some ketchup because, uh, it would be certainly interesting, but I just, I think that's all it is, is a fan wank fantasy.

917
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:43,540
I don't think it's rooted in reality, but what is real anymore?

918
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,260
What is real anymore?

919
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:51,780
Anyway, uh, Loki, anything else you want to say with that story?

920
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,380
No, that's it really.

921
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,380
What do you think about the whole thing, Loki?

922
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,660
Do you think this is a good route for Sony?

923
00:55:59,500 --> 00:55:59,940
Sure.

924
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,460
Why not?

925
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:06,260
Cause I'm not a big fan of Destiny, so I don't really care, but cool.

926
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,140
I mean, I'd be curious to see what they develop next.

927
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,300
Probably Destiny 3.

928
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,340
That's how it works nowadays.

929
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:16,580
I like Destiny on paper more than I do actually playing it.

930
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,220
And that is simply because I'm not great at shooters.

931
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,260
That's, that's really it.

932
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,300
That's the end all be all.

933
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,460
But I, I like what it is otherwise.

934
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,180
And I've spent time, I actually, that was a game I played on Stadia for a

935
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,300
bit when I was kind of evaluating and I actually, cause I was like, Oh, I

936
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,700
get to play on my PC as opposed to trying to play it on, you know, Xbox

937
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,500
or something with a controller and get to use my mouse and keyboard.

938
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,460
And it actually, it actually, I enjoyed playing it on, uh, that system.

939
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,340
So, uh, yeah, there is that.

940
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,100
So, all right.

941
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:49,460
Um, let's move on to another story about Sony and about the PlayStation

942
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,820
five and, uh, how they're not selling quite as many of them as they thought

943
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,300
they would, but it's not their fault.

944
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,140
It's the chip shortage.

945
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,380
It's the chip shortage.

946
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:03,700
It's, you know, it's that thing that's been blamed for everything.

947
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:08,260
Um, eh, Sony did the quarterly financial earnings report as these

948
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,540
large companies tend to do.

949
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,580
And they did point out there was a rise in profit in the gaming decision

950
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,740
division, excuse me, but Sony did lower the full year PlayStation five

951
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:22,980
sales forecast from 14.8 million to 11.5 million.

952
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,380
That is a fiscal year forecast.

953
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,060
So that means it ends on March 31st.

954
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,380
That's the year they're talking about.

955
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:32,020
Um, now of course, according to the chief financial officer at Sony, uh,

956
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:37,380
Hiroke Totoke, uh, the, uh, we can't say exactly for sure what

957
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,900
the demand is for next year.

958
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:44,860
Um, sorry, that's not part of the quote, but basically that, um, no, that

959
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,140
what I read is, sorry, I thought this next part was, I was about to read,

960
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:51,620
but, uh, in, in short, basically, uh, chip production and all that is,

961
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:55,180
has been affected by the ongoing chip shortages around the world.

962
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:59,820
So, uh, yeah, uh, Sony's trying to get more PlayStation fives, but these

963
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,500
chip shortages are going to continue for the time being, which again, if

964
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,460
you're paying to paying attention to anything in electronics, cars, the

965
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,940
refrigerator, Alan and I are trying to buy, uh, any of this stuff, it's,

966
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,500
it all plays in any of this.

967
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:16,780
Um, Intel has actually said the semiconductor shortages

968
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,500
can continue into 2023.

969
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:25,380
Um, Nintendo has also slashed a switch production and said a 20% decrease

970
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:30,460
in availability as has X-Box talked about this, uh, basically saying,

971
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,460
um, interesting though, when Phil Spencer talked about it, he said,

972
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:37,260
I think it's probably too isolated to talk about it as just a chip problem.

973
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,380
When I think about what does it mean to get the parts necessary to build a

974
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,220
console today and then get it to the markets where the demand is, there are

975
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,140
multiple kinds of pinch points in that process.

976
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,100
So it's interesting.

977
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,060
He's kind of called out.

978
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,780
There's other interesting things.

979
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:54,700
It's trying to get that boat through the Panama canal.

980
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,860
And then there's one boat that's making them all back up that causes

981
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,740
these consoles to, uh, not happen on time.

982
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,180
It's basically what it's coming down to.

983
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,300
So, yep.

984
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:10,220
Anyway, um, not terribly surprising to hear, but it is interesting when

985
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:14,300
you hear it resulted in the, uh, or you hear it reported in the company's

986
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,180
financial statements, basically it's, uh, yeah, I still don't have a PlayStation

987
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,940
five, but I'm hoping, I'm hoping, um, after this move settles down and now

988
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,900
you all know why I didn't indulge in the holidays, cause I've been saving

989
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,620
for this house stuff, but, um, after that all settles down, I'm hoping I will

990
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:32,540
finally get the PlayStation five, maybe over the summer, uh, if the finances

991
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:36,420
still look good, cause, uh, I don't want to miss Final Fantasy 16 if it comes

992
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,780
out this year, that's for sure.

993
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:38,980
So we'll see.

994
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,420
All right, moving on Dark Sakura.

995
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,620
Why, why talk about new consoles when we can talk about old ones?

996
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,140
Thanks for the spoiler, Rob.

997
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:48,700
Sorry.

998
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,380
It's on the sidebar for what it's worth.

999
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,740
Yeah, but I have my own intro set up for that.

1000
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,580
Oh, my bad.

1001
00:59:54,660 --> 01:00:00,140
Anyway, um, I was going to say there's a new game coming on an old thing.

1002
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:08,300
So, uh, well, the game is coming out on the Wii U in the eShop and it's going

1003
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:13,940
to use the balance board, or at least it can use the balance board, but it is a,

1004
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:20,620
um, a game called Silver Falls, white inside it's Umbra, it's a horror

1005
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,780
game, uh, done by Sun Grand Studios.

1006
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:28,820
Um, it will allow you to use the balance board for, uh, you know,

1007
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,740
for movement if you want to.

1008
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,140
Um, it looks pretty cool.

1009
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:38,020
I mean, this is sort of what I always thought the Wii U would have been great

1010
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:44,140
for, you know, I always wished that, um, that there'd been other games that had

1011
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:49,580
such deep integration with, uh, with the, the game pad, you know, so that you

1012
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:53,460
could see more stuff on there or use it to solve your puzzles or make it a

1013
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,900
camera or something.

1014
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,980
Um, but it looks pretty cool.

1015
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:02,300
I mean, I don't know if it's worth me busting out wherever I put my Wii U to

1016
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,300
play, but Hey, it could be fun.

1017
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,220
And I like, I like kind of scary games.

1018
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:11,300
So, yeah, I think that's a good question.

1019
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,340
You bring up those, how many people still have their Wii U hooked up?

1020
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,380
Cause I don't, I don't even have a Wii U anymore.

1021
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:17,900
Yeah, I know.

1022
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,060
I think a lot of people, I mean, I'm sure there's some, like if I pulled

1023
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,340
the chat, there'd be a couple of people that are like, Oh, I still have it.

1024
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:22,780
I still have it.

1025
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,860
I mean, how many of you actually still have a hooked up to your TV, ready

1026
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,340
to power on in a moment's notice?

1027
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,740
Cause I still have my Wii U it's just in a box.

1028
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:35,060
Ours was actually until like mid last year when we loaned it to Julian.

1029
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:35,660
Hmm.

1030
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,740
So, okay.

1031
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,620
There's a couple of people, it's about half and half.

1032
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,940
Some say I do some say I have it, but it's not hooked up or mine's in store.

1033
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,540
We busted out from time to time for certain games.

1034
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:49,660
Like Dan and I had talked about trying to dig it out to play Shantae.

1035
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,340
So, okay.

1036
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:53,780
Yeah.

1037
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:57,300
And especially I think anybody with a passing retro interest, I mean, a, the

1038
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,700
virtual console is more expansive on the Wii U there's that and be, you know, just

1039
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,860
people that are retro console console enthusiasts are going to tend to have

1040
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:08,540
more systems set up readily accessible when they get the urge to play something

1041
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:12,260
retro, which, you know, the Wii U kind of fits in that category now as a retro

1042
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,340
console, they, I know it's weird to think about, but it kind of is at this point.

1043
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,940
Um, when did the Wii U release?

1044
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:18,940
Was it 20?

1045
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,700
Was it 2012?

1046
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,620
Are we hitting the 10 year point?

1047
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:23,380
No, no, no.

1048
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,580
Cause it was, it was after I started my new job.

1049
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:30,060
So that would have been after 2014 and he was like 2015 or something.

1050
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,180
Was it really that?

1051
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:31,500
I guess.

1052
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:31,900
Oh, wow.

1053
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,540
Maybe it was Bob Coffees is 2013 was the year.

1054
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,020
2013.

1055
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,540
Oh, I might've gotten a little bit late.

1056
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:38,140
Yeah.

1057
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:39,460
All right.

1058
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:40,420
Anyway.

1059
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,100
Uh, let's move on Loki.

1060
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:47,180
So speaking of Nintendo consoles and, you know, sales and stuff, you know, the

1061
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:53,700
switch it's doing well, it's outsold the Nintendo Wii something that, you know, we

1062
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,940
thought that might not actually be possible, but yes, apparently it is quite

1063
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,780
possible to do that.

1064
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,700
So, um, not bad.

1065
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:06,860
Uh, I'm curious to see a word ends up leaving off at the end.

1066
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,820
I mean, cause I mean, if it's already outsold the Wii and it's only been out a

1067
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:19,260
few years, um, it's going to be interesting to see, but, um, yeah, 103

1068
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:25,020
million or 103.5 million units sold since the end of the year.

1069
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,300
So pretty good.

1070
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:28,740
Yeah, not bad.

1071
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:33,220
I'm curious, we'll probably get an updated number to that around March.

1072
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:33,780
I'm guessing.

1073
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,740
Cause that's usually the end of the financial year.

1074
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:40,780
So we'll have to wait and see, you know, a good point that, um, Jason, our, our

1075
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:45,540
voiceover guy brought up is that, um, part of the reason probably why you see

1076
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:47,380
this number is as high as it is.

1077
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,460
I mean, it's, it's a great console and you know, there's good games on it.

1078
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,580
And of course all that's very important and we shouldn't neglect any of that.

1079
01:03:54,340 --> 01:04:00,060
But, um, when the Wii was out, you also still had the Nintendo DS and the 3DS

1080
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,980
that was capturing that part of the handheld market and Nintendo has

1081
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,740
essentially consolidated their two markets.

1082
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:11,420
So the Wii does not exist separately as the DS and 3DS as a platform.

1083
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:15,100
Nintendo has gone from two platforms to one platform that does both.

1084
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,180
And so that's also a big part of this as well is that that number really

1085
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,300
reflects handheld and, you know, uh, console.

1086
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:23,820
I'm surprised.

1087
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:29,380
So like the top selling game is Mario Kart eight deluxe, which is that 43.35

1088
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:33,860
million units, but like you would think like Mario Odyssey would be up there.

1089
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,700
It's only 23 million.

1090
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:40,700
And then even like say, you know, breath of the wild is 25 million.

1091
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,220
So I'm kind of surprised that those are so low.

1092
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,140
I am as well, but it's very, it's very, that's a Wii U game.

1093
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:50,940
Uh, well, I, I think that's actually not a factor anymore

1094
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,140
that it was a Wii U game.

1095
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:55,180
I think that, you know, nobody bought the Wii U.

1096
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,900
I know I'm making a broad stroke there.

1097
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:58,380
Sorry.

1098
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,380
Especially to everybody in chat that just said, my Wii U is still hooked up.

1099
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,060
I think the reality is nobody bought the Wii U.

1100
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:09,700
Uh, and so, um, you know, when we talk about these big numbers and so I think

1101
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,740
that part isn't as much, and I think what it is, it's just, it's just that thing

1102
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:17,580
that Mario Kart is that easy multiplayer party game that people want to own so

1103
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,660
that they have like the party game for people to play or people come over and

1104
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,740
there's game night and I think Mario Kart is just like that thing that's in

1105
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:28,820
our culture that so many people know now, you know, that it's just, I think that's

1106
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:33,460
why it even outsells a brilliant title like breath of the wild where I don't

1107
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,700
think there's as many people that are, cause you know, if you want to play

1108
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:39,300
breath of the wild, you're going to have to sit down and game, you're going to,

1109
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:42,460
you know, spend some time with breath of the wild and not everybody approaches

1110
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,820
their video games like that where they're playing for hours and hours at a time.

1111
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:49,300
Some people just want to be able to play Mario Kart, uh, before or after

1112
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,500
the game that's on television.

1113
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,780
I think that's a big part of it.

1114
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:57,740
Uh, what it is, um, Bob coffee and chat says Mario Kart, deluxe is evergreen.

1115
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,100
Tons of normies buy it every day.

1116
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:00,780
Exactly.

1117
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:02,820
It's normies muggles, I guess.

1118
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:08,820
Although I don't, I don't love using words in her environment, but, um, muggle,

1119
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:14,380
muggles always a way I've explained non-gamers, um, dark Tetsuya said, I mean,

1120
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,660
I thought that we, you was all right, but consider I have like a dozen Wii U games

1121
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,860
compared to over two dozen on switch.

1122
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,740
Yeah, me, me saying no one bought the Wii U does not suddenly make it a bad console

1123
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,060
or all the games on it were bad.

1124
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:26,140
I owned a Wii U.

1125
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:26,940
I thought it was great.

1126
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,580
And there was a lot of games on it I really liked and I think EA really fucked

1127
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,700
them, but that's, that's a whole other story.

1128
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,140
I think Nintendo did do some misfires with the Wii U and the number one

1129
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,580
misfire was the name.

1130
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,180
Um, but that's old news at this point.

1131
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:44,780
Uh, the reality is, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's passed away.

1132
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,700
Uh, and now the switch is the new person in town and that's, uh, that's

1133
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,260
what it is.

1134
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,780
So, uh, E3VL says casuals.

1135
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:53,940
Yes, there is that as well.

1136
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,940
Uh, moving on, uh, you know, what casuals love is Pokemon.

1137
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:01,260
And this is some very welcome news.

1138
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:06,100
I think for a lot of people, um, especially after, remember last week we

1139
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:10,300
had that news story about there was a YouTube channel with all this Nintendo

1140
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,980
music that got shut down.

1141
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:16,060
And, you know, I think our response to that was, boy, it would be great if

1142
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,460
Nintendo would have like a fucking player of their own somewhere where you

1143
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:23,660
could play the music and sure folks pointed out, oh, they're super smash

1144
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:27,900
brothers, but even that is, you know, that's embedded within another game.

1145
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,980
And it's not something that really, you know, it's not like a library online

1146
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,420
you can access and all this stuff.

1147
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,100
Well, this makes the news this week.

1148
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:42,220
Very interesting that Pokemon diamond and Pokemon Pearl audio are now available

1149
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:44,900
for use in personal projects.

1150
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:49,420
That is way off the course of what we would expect for Nintendo, right?

1151
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:53,140
Now, granted, this is the Pokemon company and it's technically separate, but

1152
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:55,420
obviously there's a relationship there, right?

1153
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:00,500
So the Pokemon company launched the DP sound library.

1154
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:03,260
DP stands for diamond Pearl.

1155
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,180
I just want to make that very clear about Pokemon diamond Pearl.

1156
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:09,700
You can use audio from, uh, Pokemon diamond and Pokemon

1157
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,620
Pearl in your personal projects.

1158
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:16,820
You can put sound effects in there in like a social media video, like a YouTube

1159
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:21,580
or Twitch, you could, if, if Bobby Black Wolf wanted to take out his overclocked

1160
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:26,260
music breaks and use Pokemon DP library, he could, I don't think he will.

1161
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:31,140
Cause we still love overclocked here, but that is something that could be available

1162
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,740
here on Twitch and what have you.

1163
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:36,940
Um, also background music is allowed for non-commercial

1164
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,580
event or personal websites.

1165
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,580
So in other words, you can't exactly like put it in a movie and sell the movie.

1166
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:46,900
I imagine though, you could probably play it at a convention and get away with it,

1167
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,460
even though that's kind of more of a gray area, but I digress.

1168
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:52,460
You can also download the music to use.

1169
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:56,700
Uh, you can stream the music if you just want some online radio type of stuff.

1170
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:57,900
It's all there.

1171
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:05,180
Um, now, uh, there are of course bands on commercial uses, so no remix album to

1172
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:07,820
sell, you can't put them in your own game.

1173
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:10,900
No broadcast TV or radio or any of that.

1174
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,860
You cannot use the media.

1175
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:13,900
I think this is interesting.

1176
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:19,060
You cannot use the media and anything that makes specific, ideological,

1177
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:22,540
religious, or political claims.

1178
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:23,580
Sorry.

1179
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:27,140
I'm laughing because I thought of something a streamer did last night and I'm

1180
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:31,140
going to, I'm going to warn Alan's in the kitchen, laughing too.

1181
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:35,900
Sorry.

1182
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,020
I can't no COVID Mon.

1183
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,380
No, Alan in the other room went, you know who also caught them all?

1184
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:42,460
Jesus.

1185
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,940
But here's the thing.

1186
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:46,700
Okay.

1187
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:50,220
So there was, so you would not, you would not be able to use this in your stream.

1188
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,980
So it was actually, it was actually losing color.

1189
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:56,740
Was I, I'm just going to, I'm going to warn, I'm going to warn this could ruffle

1190
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:01,180
some feathers, but I, I think if you just look at his humor and don't read too much

1191
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:03,100
into it, it's actually kind of funny.

1192
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,900
Was doing one of those postgame chats with people and was just like, you know,

1193
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,740
typing or like I remember he was doing this whole thing as a, and then at the

1194
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:17,220
very, very end just put, Oh, and by the way, enter, God doesn't exist left.

1195
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,700
And I don't know why, but like Alan and I thought that was like the funniest troll.

1196
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,420
Like we were watching on the TV in our bedroom.

1197
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,180
We just start dying laughing.

1198
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,620
Oh, the player's name was God's warrior.

1199
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:31,100
I didn't even.

1200
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,780
Oh, that was it.

1201
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:34,900
I didn't even see that.

1202
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,660
Oh, I just thought he randomly pulled that out of thin air.

1203
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,580
Just wanted to let you know, God doesn't exist.

1204
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:40,140
Good night.

1205
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,900
And I just started laughing.

1206
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:48,460
The other one that cracked me up, that was like, like something AR 14 or whatever.

1207
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,620
And then I made some sort of comment about that too.

1208
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,980
And I, I forgot anyway.

1209
01:10:54,180 --> 01:11:00,340
So anyway, my point is probably would not want to use Pokemon DP music during that.

1210
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:07,780
So if you're trying to make a, a religious or what have you a type of thing, a lot of

1211
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:12,820
people noticing this comes right off the heels, off the youth, after the YouTube

1212
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:16,180
channel gets shut down, of course, this isn't Nintendo that did this.

1213
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:19,300
It's the Pokemon company, but still hard to ignore.

1214
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:24,340
And I think a lot of people are looking at this going, please, Pokemon company, please,

1215
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:31,140
please, will you go talk to your daddy Nintendo and tell him what a good idea this

1216
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:34,100
is and how Nintendo should do this?

1217
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:39,460
I mean, how many of you are just sitting here foaming at the mouth, salivating that

1218
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:40,660
Nintendo do this?

1219
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:41,860
I know I am.

1220
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:50,060
Can you, can you fucking imagine if Nintendo actually said, actually said, you can use

1221
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,980
our music and your streams royalty free.

1222
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:52,500
Enjoy.

1223
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,740
You would never hear it already treated like they do that anyway.

1224
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:00,420
So I don't understand what the difference would be, but it's a gray area now.

1225
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:05,860
I guess so, but people already use it carte blanche, so why not?

1226
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,340
It would just be, I just be phenomenal.

1227
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:13,340
Anyway, I hope this isn't the last, I have a feeling this might be a test of sorts.

1228
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,100
We'll see how that all plays out.

1229
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:20,100
But, um, I'm, I'm really hoping it's not the last that we see of this sort of thing.

1230
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,460
Maybe we'll see more Pokemon music make its way into this sort of format or something.

1231
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,060
Uh, I think that would be really great.

1232
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:30,900
So, uh, Bob Coffey says at the very least, Nintendo should put their stuff on CD here

1233
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:36,260
or like the streaming services, Apple music, Spotify, Tidal, pick one of them,

1234
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:36,860
pick all of them.

1235
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,580
I don't give a shit.

1236
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:42,340
Just get the music out there to a place we can actually, you know, stream it very

1237
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:44,220
easily, but meh.

1238
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:45,780
All right.

1239
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,260
Moving on.

1240
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:47,140
Yeah.

1241
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:55,340
Well, um, Epic has filed a trademark for Epic Games, Megaverse.

1242
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:01,780
Um, they are, they filed it at the end of 2021 and it's supposed to cover a wide

1243
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:09,220
range of goods and services and be a new umbrella for their big overall universe

1244
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,020
that they want to do.

1245
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:17,340
Uh, they're sort of putting it out there as sort of a 3D virtual space to play

1246
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,620
and work and people hang out, I guess.

1247
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:20,460
Sort of like a mobile-

1248
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,380
Can they just finish their storefront, please?

1249
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,540
And stop all this nonsense.

1250
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:32,580
It's supposed to be a, as some sort of like mobile conversational service.

1251
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:39,180
So, but I mean, is this like their version of Play?

1252
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:40,540
Is it?

1253
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:44,860
It sounds like their version of the Metaverse, like Facebook's, you want to

1254
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,740
talk about VR 90s shit?

1255
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:47,300
Look at that.

1256
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:50,900
Look at that stuff that Facebook's trying to pull us with, with the Metaverse.

1257
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,740
That's what this sounds like to me.

1258
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:58,140
But like, I'm sorry, in the Metaverse, I don't want to have a me anymore.

1259
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,540
I think we've moved beyond that.

1260
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:02,900
Well, Epic's games, Megaverse have a shopping cart available.

1261
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:07,460
I swear to God, we're going to start our own Metaverse, you know, type thing.

1262
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,980
It's like, you can't even finish the storefront.

1263
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,500
Don't, don't start talking to me.

1264
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:16,660
If Steam wants to start off their own Metaverse thing, by all means, they

1265
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,940
can go ahead and talk about that.

1266
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,020
Cause they, at least they have a functioning storefront.

1267
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:24,780
I, I'm going to say Steam kind of has the opposite problem is that Steam tries to

1268
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:27,860
put their pause in too many things and then doesn't do anything with it.

1269
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:32,100
And I think the case in point is their whole, do you know, Steam has a broadcast,

1270
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,460
like a Twitch competitor built into Steam?

1271
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,420
Where was the last, yeah, exactly.

1272
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,820
When was the last time anyone thought about that?

1273
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:42,980
That Steam has a competitor to Twitch built into Steam.

1274
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:47,540
I, I think every time I go there, it's a lot of Russian streams.

1275
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:50,580
So maybe, and maybe that's also Dota 2's popularity over there.

1276
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:53,060
Um, I don't, so it may be a combination of those things.

1277
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:56,460
Maybe it's just more popular in other countries than it is here, but it's just,

1278
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:59,300
it's one of those things where I'm always like, Steam just kind of like

1279
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,300
builds it and then lets it get moldy.

1280
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,860
Like, it's just like, it's weird.

1281
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:06,980
Anyway.

1282
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,060
But I guess good luck to Epic Games and the Megaverse.

1283
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:14,420
But, uh, it's just one of those things where it's like, I kind of agree with

1284
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,700
Loki is that it's, it's weird that they're even talking about this when

1285
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,940
their storefront is still as bad as it is.

1286
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:22,500
There's like so much cart before the horse type stuff.

1287
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:26,660
Like first off, like the metaverse stuff that they're talking about is like

1288
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:30,500
white, white, it's to satisfy investors.

1289
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:34,580
It's to satisfy investors, but I wish investors could see right through this.

1290
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,300
It feels like the investors don't use any of the products.

1291
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:38,420
Exactly.

1292
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:41,700
Cause like you're talking about, like the metaverse stuff, like let's okay.

1293
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:44,180
It's like basically ready player one kind of nonsense.

1294
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:48,180
You have to talk about wide adoption of VR, which I'm all for.

1295
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:50,020
Like, I really hope we get to that point.

1296
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,860
We are nowhere near that point.

1297
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,460
And then on top of that, your vision of it looks stupid.

1298
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:58,020
I don't want that, that vision of it.

1299
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,820
Like I would rather do the stuff that they were talking about, like with

1300
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:02,580
HoloLens, that seems a lot cooler.

1301
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:03,780
I mean, I just.

1302
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,020
I got it.

1303
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:07,620
I got it.

1304
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,620
Like it's, it's, it's all about, yeah.

1305
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:10,820
It's all about investors.

1306
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:13,620
And like you say a buzz, you know, phrase.

1307
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,260
It's like, that's why I knew everyone's getting in the NFTs.

1308
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,500
It's just because, Ooh, money NFTs.

1309
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,780
I liked NFT.

1310
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,740
I'll give you money now.

1311
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:23,140
It's like, Oh, I've got it.

1312
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:23,700
I've got it.

1313
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:27,300
I'm going to say something and you're going to hate me.

1314
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,500
And if you already hate me, you're going to hate me more.

1315
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:31,800
Ready?

1316
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:41,400
What if Sony bought Bungie to help them make the Sony metaverse home 2.0 and

1317
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,320
always online experience in gaming.

1318
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,920
I don't actually, I don't actually think that, but I wanted to speak it

1319
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:52,360
into existence just to make everybody, uh, bang their head against the

1320
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,640
nearest flat surface.

1321
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,200
You're welcome.

1322
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,080
They would never do that.

1323
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,880
Deetra Rama S in chat says get out.

1324
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,520
Home was pretty good.

1325
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:03,640
I mean, that's a lot closer than say, you know, what, what they're doing

1326
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,800
with like meta and stuff.

1327
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,200
I'm sorry.

1328
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,720
I'm not going to call them that anymore with Facebook's like idea of the, the

1329
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:15,480
metaverse thing, Facebook's being a butthole, which is just a big old rip

1330
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,360
off of ready player one.

1331
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:16,760
Anyways.

1332
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,120
I mean, honestly, have you heard the latest with Facebook where now they're

1333
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:23,160
threatening to pull out of Europe because Europe won't let them violate

1334
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:27,480
privacy and sell the information to U S the company that you want to have.

1335
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:32,600
Like they do, they do understand that they're the IOI of this, you know,

1336
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,520
ready player one story.

1337
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,200
I mean, they're not the good company.

1338
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,480
They're the company that you distrust in like are the evil company.

1339
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,640
So I don't care if they're going to try to bring it to the world.

1340
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,520
It's just, no, it will never work.

1341
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,640
E3 VL in chat says PS home was ahead of its time.

1342
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,640
Just the load times and download was horrible.

1343
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,200
You know what?

1344
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,440
You know what?

1345
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,080
Yes.

1346
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,680
I, you know, and I I've given PlayStation home a fair amount of shit on this show.

1347
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:04,200
Where, who is the guy that used to, um, really evangelize PlayStation home here?

1348
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,640
He used to come in on Sunday nights.

1349
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,840
He used to talk up home and all the good that I, where, where is that?

1350
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,560
I know he rage quit and stopped listening at some point ago.

1351
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,200
Where is that?

1352
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,800
I want to apologize to that guy.

1353
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,240
I, cause I think, I think he was onto something.

1354
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,120
It's just a bummer.

1355
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:22,200
Sony didn't just stick with it a little while longer.

1356
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,680
And I think, I think maybe the PlayStation three wasn't the right place for it.

1357
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:31,560
I think the PlayStation four might've been able to handle a little more what they wanted it to do,

1358
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,400
where it was, um, you know, the, the trophies were actually things that you had

1359
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,440
and all of that stuff.

1360
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,720
Like Sony could have had this a long time ago.

1361
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,600
It's a real bummer.

1362
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:41,960
Could have should have.

1363
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:42,200
Yeah.

1364
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,480
Could have should have would have.

1365
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:43,980
All right.

1366
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,420
Anyway.

1367
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,280
Um, as 200 Matt says, yeah, PlayStation home was ahead of its time.

1368
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,640
Same with game room.

1369
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,880
Same with one versus a hundred, just to touch it.

1370
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:57,560
Well, if I can continue with what I was going to say in my story, I guess.

1371
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,060
Yeah.

1372
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,100
Okay.

1373
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:05,160
Um, they're claiming that the investment is going to, and this is a quote, accelerate the

1374
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:09,800
work around building connected social experiences in Fortnite Rocket League and Fall Guys.

1375
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:16,840
And also, you know, helping, uh, you know, developers and other creators use Unreal

1376
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,960
Engine and the Epic, uh, services and their online store and stuff like that.

1377
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:29,560
So it's, I think it's meant to drive content and communication.

1378
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:35,160
So it also sounds to me that Epic games is saying the mega verse is just Fortnite.

1379
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,440
No rocket league.

1380
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,480
And this is one.

1381
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,080
No, they absolutely do.

1382
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:45,000
But isn't it even better if Epic can tie all that into Fortnite?

1383
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:50,280
I, I, I feel like it's just, it's just be a, such a thing for them to do anyway.

1384
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,520
All right.

1385
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,840
Um, moving on, I think we're over to Loki.

1386
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:56,760
Yeah.

1387
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:03,720
So like the everybody's been asking, Hey, Rockstar, when are you going to make Grand Theft Auto six?

1388
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,600
Except I haven't been asking that cause I just don't care anymore.

1389
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,480
I made you care, right?

1390
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,680
Just, I'm not going to ask about it.

1391
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:15,400
So they finally have decided to publish a statement on it and saying that, Hey, with

1392
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:20,280
unprecedented longevity of Grand Theft Auto five, we know many of you have been asking about a new

1393
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,880
entry in the Grand Theft Auto series.

1394
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,840
Yeah, because it's been over almost 10 years now.

1395
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:30,920
Um, and with every new project we embark on, our goal is the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1396
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,560
Okay.

1397
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:37,720
So basically they're, they're looking to push, you know, the boundaries of gaming and whatnot,

1398
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:41,880
and that their next entry is going to be, is in active development.

1399
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,520
And they're looking to push those boundaries as well.

1400
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:50,520
So yes, in development, who knows when the hell it's coming out?

1401
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,120
Well, it's been in development since like Red Dead Redemption two.

1402
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,560
So I mean, like, I don't know.

1403
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:01,560
I was going to say the fact that they're working on a Grand Theft Auto six should surprise nobody.

1404
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,320
No, it's not a surprise.

1405
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,880
But it's just interesting to hear them acknowledge it for a change.

1406
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:10,680
You know, like, Oh yes, that super obvious thing.

1407
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,840
And they're the big, big elephant in the room.

1408
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,320
Here it is.

1409
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,640
And also on top of that, though, like, I don't like,

1410
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,080
I'm not giving them the benefit of the doubt here.

1411
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,840
Like, I need to see this game.

1412
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,120
You know, I can't throw trust into companies anymore.

1413
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,800
Like, especially with some of the stuff that they've tried to pull with certain games.

1414
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,640
They make quality games, yes.

1415
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:35,080
But they also can kind of rush to get things done.

1416
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,400
Yeah, I'm excited about it.

1417
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,320
Assuming that the online or that the single player campaign's good,

1418
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,560
because that's really all I'm interested in online.

1419
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,480
Yeah, not for me.

1420
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:51,400
LM Orchard in our chat says GTA six in the metaverse.

1421
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,360
Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna need you to come.

1422
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,280
Come put your face close to your mobile device or monitor screen.

1423
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,760
Come come put your face close to it so I can slap you.

1424
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:01,160
Come here.

1425
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:01,480
Come here.

1426
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:03,000
Come here.

1427
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
They're not doing that in the metaverse.

1428
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,200
And they already have, was it?

1429
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,920
They announced that they're doing San Andreas, remember?

1430
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:15,080
And probably about the same company that did the remaster do the VR version.

1431
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,280
So good luck with that.

1432
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,480
That's going to be a horror show.

1433
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,440
But you know, I'm all down.

1434
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,840
I'm down to see it whenever the hell that comes out.

1435
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:29,720
All right, look, enough enough metaverse, enough VR, AR, enough of that.

1436
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:35,160
Why don't we why don't we talk about a company that likes to make retro inspired things?

1437
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,960
Let's talk about Yacht Club Games and their latest project, which they unveiled this week.

1438
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,720
It's called Mina the Hollower is the name of it.

1439
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:48,200
It's a 60 frame a second, and they're calling it a Game Boy Color homage.

1440
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,280
But I don't know if it looks Game Boy Color to me.

1441
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:52,840
I guess so.

1442
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:57,960
It just looks more of a product of that era, like Shovel Knight was and so forth.

1443
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,760
But yeah, they're making it run at 60 frames a second.

1444
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,840
It's a top down adventure game full of mystery and horror.

1445
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,880
They're saying Link's Awakening meets Castlevania with a sprinkle of Dark Souls.

1446
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,480
Why does everything have to be Dark Souls?

1447
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,920
Whatever to me, it's going to be because it's hard.

1448
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,360
Doesn't mean it's Dark Souls.

1449
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:20,280
I saw Star Tropics, but Gothic, that's what I saw in it.

1450
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,640
But I guess there's similarities to all those topics.

1451
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:29,480
Loki, I'm going to need you to put your face really close to the TV, please.

1452
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,520
We're going to need to time you out.

1453
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,800
Someone attempt ban Loki.

1454
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,520
Anyway, time out, Loki, 60 seconds.

1455
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:44,280
All right, the game is currently in production and all this stuff.

1456
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,960
And if you want to get on the game now, you can go to Kickstarter.

1457
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,200
That's kind of interesting.

1458
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:55,400
But it's one of those things where, like, because, you know, I've been very nervous

1459
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,280
about backing.

1460
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:01,160
I really haven't done one in a long time, and I'm probably not going to because just

1461
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:04,040
there's been too many projects on Kickstarter that don't deliver.

1462
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,280
And that's the reality from my perspective.

1463
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:13,000
But I also understand where Yacht Club Games, who found that success for Shovel Knight,

1464
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
which truly was one of the great Kickstarter success stories.

1465
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,840
I can understand why they're going back to their roots a little bit with this.

1466
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,840
I fully expect this game will come out.

1467
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:27,240
I mean, the trailer was pretty outstanding and shows that the game is far enough along

1468
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,120
in development.

1469
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:31,240
And I mean, shit, they've already blown through their goal.

1470
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,800
They were only trying to raise $311,000.

1471
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,960
They've already hit $703,000.

1472
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,400
They're well past their goal.

1473
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,600
The game will happen.

1474
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,520
It's just, you know, how many stretch goals are they going to hit?

1475
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,680
But it is on Kickstarter.

1476
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:48,040
So they're up to, oh, this might interest you, DarkSakura.

1477
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:52,760
The next stretch goal at $800,000, which I'm sure they'll hit because there are 22 days

1478
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:58,520
left in this, is the Mac and Linux port of the game will be the $800,000 goal.

1479
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,440
They've already reached sound test, cheat codes, and new game plus.

1480
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:07,400
So Mac and Linux port is up next for me.

1481
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,040
I did spend money on a Kickstarter.

1482
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,920
Oh, yeah.

1483
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,000
Somebody dropped that on my doorstep too.

1484
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,560
Uh, which, um, you know, again, I just kind of feel the way I feel about Kickstarter.

1485
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:24,360
So I didn't back it, but I'd be curious when that game comes out.

1486
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:26,440
Yeah.

1487
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,120
So anyway, what was the name of drag?

1488
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,560
Her was the name of it or something like that, right?

1489
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:31,720
Yeah.

1490
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,200
Drag her.

1491
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,480
It looks pretty funny.

1492
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,480
It looks like everybody looks like Trixie Mattel.

1493
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:35,980
Yeah.

1494
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:40,040
Uh, and Mike Deaf points out the Kickstarter isn't to fund the game.

1495
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:44,680
The Kickstarter is to fund future projects for the franchise, like merch and future spinoffs.

1496
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,160
Well, but it does affect the game.

1497
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:51,320
Like I know that was the line they're giving, but look, the stretch goal they're on Mac

1498
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,720
and Linux port that directly relates new game.

1499
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:56,120
Plus these are things that relate to the game.

1500
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,360
So it's, I get it.

1501
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:58,840
I get it.

1502
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:05,000
But it, and when I do feel more comfortable about Kickstarters and to be clear is when

1503
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,560
the Kickstarter is more to fund the publishing of the game, like I already have a finished

1504
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:17,240
product, I just need to make the cartridges to put Pixel Poops 2 on to sell, you know,

1505
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,000
the actual NES cartridges.

1506
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,160
That's where Kickstarters make more sense to me.

1507
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:26,120
So that way, you know, you're only funding as many of those as actually need to be made.

1508
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,280
So that's, um, yeah.

1509
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:35,880
Anyway, um, let's see, uh, as shown here, Matt says when yacht club games did the Kickstarter

1510
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:39,880
campaign for Shovel Knight, they provided consistent and fully transparent updates.

1511
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:43,720
So the community never felt it was ghosted and saw a lot of products.

1512
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,160
Um, yeah.

1513
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:50,520
So, uh, I think that's why this Kickstarter kind of feels a little bit different.

1514
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,160
That's for sure.

1515
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:52,360
All right.

1516
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:56,040
Well, on a retro note, roll the bumper for the next segment.

1517
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:12,680
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1518
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,000
out a classic and tell you about it.

1519
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,640
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1520
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,600
All right.

1521
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:27,480
But this time dark Sakura has a, uh, classic electronic handheld that she's going to be

1522
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,920
sharing with us here.

1523
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:33,080
Uh, so dark Sakura, what is the, uh, classic handheld?

1524
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:37,160
It is, uh, Mattel electronics football.

1525
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:44,680
And I'm talking about a old, uh, this was released in 1977.

1526
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:50,040
There was, depending on which version was released, like there was a rerelease of it.

1527
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,000
There was football or football one, cause there was a football two later.

1528
01:27:53,640 --> 01:28:01,000
Um, but it was basically, um, you had like little dots that represented the players and

1529
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:01,960
everything.

1530
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:06,360
Um, there were, it's a lot of differences between some of the different models too.

1531
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:13,720
The, the font on the first edition of it was that sort of seventies looking digital looking

1532
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:14,200
font.

1533
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:23,000
Um, it also, uh, the early ones came with an AC adapter jack that was removed on later

1534
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,080
models so that it would only run on battery.

1535
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:32,920
Um, and, uh, you know, there were other changes that they made for other markets.

1536
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:39,400
Um, but, uh, uh, some of them had like different, uh, stickers on the back.

1537
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:45,400
Like one of them said, try fresh batteries written, uh, on a, the back of the, of the

1538
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:45,800
machine.

1539
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,760
Um, it was released in June, 1977.

1540
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:54,680
It was the second game that was released by Mattel auto race was the first, it was sold

1541
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:55,400
through Sears.

1542
01:28:56,120 --> 01:29:02,200
Um, they, uh, they had made less than a hundred thousand of them.

1543
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:07,640
And then Sears, uh, said that they didn't think the game would be a big seller.

1544
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:13,000
And so, uh, they stopped production on football and auto race.

1545
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,000
And then in six months, uh, Sears was proven wrong.

1546
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,200
So they started the production up again and, uh, sold quite a bit of them.

1547
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:29,960
As many as 500,000, uh, units by a midweek, uh, sorry, by, uh, uh, selling that many a

1548
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,360
week by mid February, 1978.

1549
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,640
Um, so yeah, it's lippy blippy buttons.

1550
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,520
And didn't they do a re-release of this?

1551
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,880
I think, cause I think we have it.

1552
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,840
Um, somebody in chat is asking about that teacher.

1553
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,920
Um, S says, didn't they also re-release this?

1554
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:51,400
And so you are probably on the right track and yeah, cause I know we have it somewhere.

1555
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,400
I'm going to double check something real quick.

1556
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:56,840
Yeah, sure.

1557
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,360
Uh, getting some other comments in chat.

1558
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,480
Um, dark Tatsuya says I've heard of it, but don't think I had one.

1559
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,520
Uh, fifth dream says I played that once at a friend's house and I was little, though

1560
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,800
I have no interest in football, but I had interest in electronic games.

1561
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,600
Big same.

1562
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,800
I played this, but it was because I thought electronics were cool.

1563
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:12,280
Yeah.

1564
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:15,640
It was re-released and you can get it for 150 bucks on Amazon.

1565
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:16,520
Nice.

1566
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:17,720
Uh, tiger cloud points out.

1567
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,440
I had a cameo in guardians of the galaxy volume two.

1568
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,000
Interesting.

1569
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,280
That might also explain why they felt the need to reprint it at some point.

1570
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:28,040
So, uh, fifth dream says the definition of beep boop.

1571
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:29,500
Yes.

1572
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:35,560
Well, and you can still pick up, you know, the original ones for pretty inexpensive,

1573
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,920
like on eBay and whatnot.

1574
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:43,160
Um, there's also a baseball, there was subchase that came out in 1978.

1575
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:49,480
Um, you can even get like a little key chain version of, uh, of football.

1576
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:55,080
It's like, it's like the world's smallest, you know, you know, or yeah, the world's

1577
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,160
coolest or world's smallest edition or something.

1578
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,720
And, uh, it actually works.

1579
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:04,440
So, you know, you can still get in on that action.

1580
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,280
They still take the same bat.

1581
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:10,200
We've been using the same batteries for however many years it'll work.

1582
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,160
Uh, Ella mortured in chat says I loved the seventies and eighties attempts at sports

1583
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:18,200
games that had almost no resemblance to the actual sports.

1584
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,000
Yeah, but electronics were cool.

1585
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,600
So, and hence why we celebrate one every month here in 2022 with our classic electronic

1586
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:32,760
handheld of the month and lots of bleeps and not to be confused with blinks and blunks.

1587
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:33,160
Yes.

1588
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,560
Uh, handheld electronic football.

1589
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:37,080
A very classic.

1590
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,520
And again, if you're listening on the podcast feed, you can't see the video of this.

1591
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:43,720
I think the visual really sparks that memory for a lot of people.

1592
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:48,280
So I really encourage you to Google like image, one of these Mattel handheld electronic

1593
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,680
football and, and I'm sorry, was it Mattel?

1594
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,040
Yeah, Mattel.

1595
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:52,760
Yeah, it was Mattel.

1596
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:56,280
So I really encourage you to look, uh, and by the way, actually this, um, YouTube

1597
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,840
we're playing here actually says this is one of the remade ones.

1598
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,520
This isn't the one from the seventies.

1599
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:05,320
So it's enough, you know, that it shows how the game played.

1600
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:09,560
I mean, gosh, these things, they were pretty inexpensive.

1601
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:13,160
I think the rereleases and now though you can't really find them as well anymore,

1602
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,920
which is why they've gone up inexpensive.

1603
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:15,420
Yeah.

1604
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:16,680
All right.

1605
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:17,640
Well, there you go.

1606
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:18,140
Great pick.

1607
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:24,120
Uh, we'll get another one next month, uh, with our classic electronic handheld of the

1608
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:24,600
month.

1609
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,000
Awesome.

1610
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,500
Awesome.

1611
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:26,540
All right.

1612
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:31,900
Uh, we are going to get into our next segment, which is some rapid fire news and quickly

1613
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:34,540
talk about some other things going on in the gaming industry.

1614
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:35,040
Loki.

1615
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:36,140
Yeah.

1616
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:41,180
So suicide squad killed the justice league has been delayed to 2023.

1617
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:47,260
They need more time, you know, to make the game as polished as they can possibly be.

1618
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:49,500
No big deal.

1619
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:56,380
Um, and then there's this funny mod that's coming out for halo three on PC.

1620
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:59,100
It adds a Chevy Tahoe to it.

1621
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:00,460
Now why a Chevy Tahoe?

1622
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:05,500
Because that was in the trailer for the new paramount plus series, which doesn't make

1623
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:11,660
any sense that this vintage 500 year old Chevy Tahoe would be in there, but because, you

1624
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:13,100
know, product placement is a thing.

1625
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:16,780
Now it's a thing in your PC version of halo three.

1626
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:17,680
Sure.

1627
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:19,340
Why not?

1628
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:21,600
Yeah.

1629
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:22,880
All right.

1630
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:25,180
Uh, Dar Sarah.

1631
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:31,580
So, um, well, that, uh, Nickelodeon, uh, all star brawl is getting a new character.

1632
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:34,940
Uh, they are getting, uh, the shredder.

1633
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:38,140
Maybe all that hardware is for making coleslaw.

1634
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:39,900
Tonight I dine on turtle soup.

1635
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:42,860
But yeah, he is.

1636
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:51,180
Yeah, he is in the game and it is definitely, you know, nineties cartoon shredder.

1637
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:59,020
And then, uh, in other news, uh, and this, this is pertinent to a lot of our listeners

1638
01:33:59,020 --> 01:33:59,520
interests.

1639
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:07,740
Um, the Pokemon legends, uh, has sold, uh, 6.5 million copies worldwide in seven days.

1640
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:13,260
And it puts it above Pokemon sword and shield in terms of its sales.

1641
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:17,260
So good job, consumer horse.

1642
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:19,180
Did you say seven days?

1643
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:21,900
I think you did.

1644
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:26,140
You know, all that makes me one is the, the bingo.

1645
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:30,380
Bob coffee and chat points out.

1646
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:33,420
It would have sold more if they fucking ship more than five copies.

1647
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:34,460
You know, that's a good point.

1648
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:38,300
There's a lot of people that didn't even get their copy until this week.

1649
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:41,180
I guess some of the distribution was having problems.

1650
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:45,500
I mean, shock and in this day and age, uh, you know, I got mine digitally, so it was

1651
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,060
whatever.

1652
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:49,740
But I think a lot of people that did opt for the physical edition, for whatever reason,

1653
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,380
you're entitled to that, uh, had to wait a little longer.

1654
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:58,060
Cause I think the official ones from, from like the Pokemon store online or whatever

1655
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:58,860
took were delayed.

1656
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,060
Like most of those were delayed.

1657
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:06,700
So it is interesting that it sold so well, uh, even amongst all those issues, but I think

1658
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:11,740
just also goes to show the strength that, um, you know, the Pokemon fandom is craving,

1659
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,740
uh, some other types of ideas.

1660
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:18,780
And I think it all but guarantees we will see this legends concept again, whether it

1661
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:24,540
is legitimately a sequel to legends or like even, uh, the next mainline game, looking

1662
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:28,860
a little more, uh, like a hybrid, uh, we'll see, we will see.

1663
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,500
So, oh wow.

1664
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:37,660
Bob coffee says, uh, kind of clarifying their comments as our store only received five copies.

1665
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:38,540
Holy moly.

1666
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:42,300
Yeah, I guess, uh, LOL supply chain.

1667
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,860
I guess the rest were, uh, stuck in the Panama canal.

1668
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:50,300
Uh, DJ Ramirez says one of our staffers got her Pokemon brilliant diamond late due to

1669
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,580
shipping from Pokemon.

1670
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:54,220
When she got it, she ended up with two copies of the game.

1671
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:57,100
I guess good things come to those who wait.

1672
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:57,900
It was interest.

1673
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:01,420
The Pokemon bread while it was in transit.

1674
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:04,860
I don't know the egg hatched insert joke here.

1675
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:06,060
All right.

1676
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:09,980
Let's, uh, travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games, uh,

1677
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:13,500
that are going to try to sell 6.5 million copies next week.

1678
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,740
Let's start in the U S they'll try.

1679
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:16,940
They'll try.

1680
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:18,700
Let's see if any of them can do it.

1681
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:24,620
Loki, any, anything in the U S uh, yeah, we've got all the Ali world on PC, Nintendo switch,

1682
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:32,780
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series, uh, Sifu on PC, PlayStation

1683
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:38,540
four and PlayStation five crossfire X on Xbox one and Xbox series.

1684
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:43,500
And then we have all of the kingdom hearts coming to Nintendo switch.

1685
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:52,780
So kingdom hearts, HD 1.5 remix, uh, HD 2.5 remix, HD 2.8 final chapter prologue and kingdom

1686
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:55,340
hearts three all on Nintendo switch.

1687
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,900
And last but not least lost arc on PC.

1688
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:00,300
Oh, that lost arc.

1689
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,980
A lot of people trying to sell me on that one.

1690
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:03,180
I might have to check that out.

1691
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:04,140
Sounds pretty interesting.

1692
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:08,060
Uh, going over to Japan and checking out the releases this week.

1693
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,940
We've got, we've got some titles this week on the Nintendo switch.

1694
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:14,860
Let me tell you, we have a game called let's play curling is coming out.

1695
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:15,580
Fuck yeah.

1696
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:16,220
Curling.

1697
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:21,100
I mean, and how, how, uh, at pro pro the timing is with the Olympics going on right now.

1698
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:24,620
I know we haven't brought that up yet, but you know, that's, that is going on.

1699
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:30,220
And curling curling is that thing that like used to be like the whole, Hey, did you stay

1700
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:33,660
up until 2 AM and watch the curling and like, it used to be like that thing that nobody

1701
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:34,140
knew about.

1702
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:37,660
And now I do feel like it's that thing that like, people are like, Oh, it's the winter

1703
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:37,980
Olympics.

1704
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:38,780
You know what that means?

1705
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:39,180
Curling.

1706
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:40,540
It's the only time it's on TV.

1707
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:41,020
Fuck yeah.

1708
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:41,500
Curling.

1709
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:42,780
Okay.

1710
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:44,140
I have to make a side note.

1711
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:46,540
That should be the name of the U S release of this game.

1712
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:47,020
Fuck yeah.

1713
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:47,500
Curling.

1714
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:53,260
You know, I like the show Canada's worst driver when it was on.

1715
01:37:53,900 --> 01:38:01,260
They, they, for one of their driving accuracy things like to do control, they have, they

1716
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:02,060
had curling.

1717
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:05,900
They created a giant puck and you had to steer it with the car.

1718
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:09,340
Sounds awesome.

1719
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:11,180
That's the most Canadian thing I've ever heard.

1720
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,380
Another big release in Japan this week.

1721
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:16,860
Uh, I'm sorry, this is too good.

1722
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:23,340
It's by idea factory on the switch called my next life as a villainous, all roots lead

1723
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:24,140
to doom.

1724
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,740
Pirates that stir the waters.

1725
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:27,100
I love it.

1726
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:30,380
There's so many subtitles and they're all great.

1727
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:32,060
That's like three games in one.

1728
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:32,940
Which, what is it?

1729
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:36,140
A villainous routes leading to doom or pirates?

1730
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,260
Are you sure it's not about me?

1731
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:41,500
I did think of you when I read this dark soccer, you should take a look.

1732
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:41,820
Hold on.

1733
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:43,020
I'll just post this in the chat.

1734
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:43,420
I don't care.

1735
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:43,740
Hold on.

1736
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:45,420
I'm going to post this link in the chat.

1737
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,540
Uh, because then when you look at the game, you're going to be like, what the fuck is

1738
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:48,780
this?

1739
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,740
This isn't, this isn't any of those things at all, actually.

1740
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:54,860
Uh, and, uh, let's see orange, right.

1741
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:57,420
In chat points out, it's a light novel.

1742
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:02,780
And yeah, when you actually kind of look at the box art and what it's about, um, it's,

1743
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:08,300
uh, the character has memories of her previous life as a high school girl in the world of

1744
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,020
fortune lover.

1745
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:13,660
She was reincarnated as a villainous who stood in between the love of the main characters

1746
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:19,500
whose endings only lead to a future of exile or death, but managed to avoid the destruction

1747
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,940
flags of the game safely.

1748
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:26,380
So this, there's a whole lot of drama going on in this game.

1749
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:32,300
There's some stories in this, but, um, it's the type of stories.

1750
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,900
It does check out that.

1751
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:38,700
Check out some of those screenshots that, uh, there's some, uh, there's some things going

1752
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:39,740
on in those screenshots.

1753
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:43,260
Anyway, those are your big titles on the squit switch this week.

1754
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:47,500
So you get curling or trashy romance novel game.

1755
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,420
Uh, it's kind of your picks.

1756
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:50,780
Why not both?

1757
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:52,380
Why, why not?

1758
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:56,860
But at the same time, my life as a villainous eternal doom in curling.

1759
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:58,780
All right.

1760
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:01,740
Anyway, there's dark soccer's game.

1761
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:06,940
I actually found something on the site that interests me a lot more.

1762
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:07,740
Oh, what's that?

1763
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:09,900
That's the switch version of Pocky and Rocky.

1764
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:15,980
Oh, uh, meanwhile on the PlayStation five, uh, some releases this week chorus, uh, a

1765
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:19,100
plague tale innocence gets its Japanese release this week.

1766
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,860
And there are some peripherals as well.

1767
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:25,580
There's, uh, um, like a racing wheel that comes out that supports some games and all

1768
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:26,540
that good stuff.

1769
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:28,460
Um, yeah, so there you go.

1770
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:30,060
Those are your Japanese releases.

1771
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:31,340
How about the UK dark soccer?

1772
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:35,420
In the UK, we have summer in Mara.

1773
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:38,380
Uh, that is, um, February 11th.

1774
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:39,980
Actually, all of these are on February 11th.

1775
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:45,660
Uh, we have bass master fishing, deluxe 20, uh, 20, 22.

1776
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:50,060
Uh, you have unbound worlds apart for PlayStation.

1777
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:54,940
And then on the switch, the grand theft auto, uh, the, the trilogy, the definitive.

1778
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:59,740
The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the VV.

1779
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:06,860
Sorry, I'm laughing at dark Tetsuya's comment and chat card curling Sakura.

1780
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:07,760
No.

1781
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:09,760
Yes.

1782
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,000
No.

1783
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:12,800
Yes.

1784
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:14,560
No.

1785
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:15,200
Yes.

1786
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:17,820
Have to say yes to that.

1787
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:18,320
Yay.

1788
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,280
Yes.

1789
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:20,240
All right.

1790
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:23,020
Moving on.

1791
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,420
Let's talk about another thing.

1792
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:28,460
A lot of people say no or yes to in our next story.

1793
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:28,960
Loki.

1794
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:31,020
Uh, yes.

1795
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:34,060
Everyone's favorite game of the week or game of the day.

1796
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:39,420
I guess a wordle has been purchased by the New York times because the New York times

1797
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:46,540
is not one to bow down from, uh, joining in the game or game company acquisition.

1798
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:50,940
That is, you know, Sony and Microsoft New York times Salsas.

1799
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:56,780
Poison to be a, you know, big game developer publisher house or whatever.

1800
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:00,220
Um, no, really like the advertisement.

1801
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:05,580
Maybe, you know, going to bring people to their site or something, um,

1802
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:07,660
put it behind their paywall eventually.

1803
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:07,980
Oh God.

1804
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:08,700
I hope not.

1805
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:09,660
Oh, they will.

1806
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:10,300
They will.

1807
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,900
If you look, if you read their comments, they're like, oh, we're not putting it behind a paywall

1808
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:14,400
initially.

1809
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:16,240
Initially.

1810
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:20,860
Like they're digital subscription growth strategy.

1811
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:21,420
Yeah.

1812
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:21,920
Yeah.

1813
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:29,500
Congrats to the New York times who was, uh, honestly, uh, not knowing enough about technology

1814
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,020
and the fact that people have already right.

1815
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,780
Click, save this game to play for it.

1816
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:34,220
Like literally, literally that's the thing.

1817
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:37,820
Everybody's like, you could just right click, save wordle and you can just play it, uh, for

1818
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:42,220
the, for the next like five years, uh, without worrying about a paywall or anything like

1819
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:42,780
that.

1820
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:47,660
Uh, so congrats to the New York times for really being dumb enough to buy wordle now

1821
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:51,580
before, you know, I just sound like I'm a complete jerk.

1822
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:57,020
I'll say major, major props to the guy and I forgot his name, but his last name is something

1823
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:02,060
like word wordle or something like he has a very, his, like his last name is very similar

1824
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:02,940
to the name of the games.

1825
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:04,220
It's kind of funny.

1826
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:04,700
I do.

1827
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:07,180
I do not fault that guy one bit.

1828
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:07,580
Good.

1829
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,260
In fact, good on him.

1830
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:12,460
Good on the spouse that inspired the game apparently and all that stuff.

1831
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:14,060
Cause she liked word games or whatever.

1832
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:19,020
Good on both of them for taking the money and running and cashing that check and getting

1833
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:20,300
an early retirement.

1834
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:23,340
I don't fault them one goddamn bit and neither should anyone.

1835
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:24,940
Uh, good for them.

1836
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:30,140
Uh, I think the New York times was really boneheaded in this.

1837
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:34,140
Uh, but now they'll own the trademark.

1838
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:39,020
Um, there isn't one now, but you, you betcha, uh, New York times is going to file a trademark

1839
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:42,700
and they would be very smart to try to get on a mobile app or something like that.

1840
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:48,700
But, uh, I just, I think the wordle gas tank only has so much fuel left in it and yeah,

1841
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:52,940
it's kind of the social media thing of the moment, but we're still in the, you know,

1842
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:58,220
hopefully closing days of the pandemic where, you know, we're not getting together in person

1843
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:59,340
the way that we used to.

1844
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:03,580
So sharing our wordle scores online is one of those things that brings some of us joy.

1845
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:06,780
Um, but eventually we're going to be back in person again.

1846
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:11,900
And I just think wordle is going to fade out as quickly into the night as it showed up.

1847
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:15,260
Um, and there's so many wordle clones now.

1848
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:18,700
Uh, thank you, Bobby Blackwell for reminding me, Josh Wardle was the guy's name.

1849
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:19,420
Thank you.

1850
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,220
Uh, and point out.

1851
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,580
And yeah, he talked about this in his story.

1852
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:24,700
I rebuilt wordle in C64 basic.

1853
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:24,940
Yeah.

1854
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:25,660
It's interesting.

1855
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:27,500
Wordle has actually, you know what wordle is?

1856
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:28,940
It's flappy bird.

1857
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,100
Wordle is flappy bird.

1858
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:32,300
That's exactly what it is.

1859
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:34,140
And now it's like that.

1860
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:35,100
It's that clone.

1861
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,700
That's going to show up everywhere.

1862
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:41,660
Cause we've seen, I've seen Mike Deft posting the wordle in Spanish scores.

1863
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:44,940
I see loodle with all the naughty words like twats.

1864
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:47,340
That's that one's fun.

1865
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:51,500
Uh, and then, uh, what I see the one with like the 10 letter long words and all this

1866
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:55,580
stuff, like there are just, there are so many knockoffs of wordle and it's just like when

1867
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:56,700
flappy bird came out.

1868
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:57,340
Right.

1869
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:02,220
Then everything in the app store was some rip off of, or, and Google play and all of

1870
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:04,300
it was just, and then there was flappy vog.

1871
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:08,780
Bobby Blackwell built flappy vog, which I was going to say is still playable on the

1872
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:12,860
site, but I actually think that's a lie because I think the, the integration that

1873
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:14,140
it uses no longer works.

1874
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:19,420
How dare you render it as a HTML five app.

1875
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:19,660
Yeah.

1876
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:21,100
And who's going to take the time to do that.

1877
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:30,220
So, um, so now Bobby says, this is, this is my good pet project to learn new languages.

1878
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:33,980
And he talked about this on his show a little bit is that, uh, you know, when you

1879
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:39,260
build your first game, the way that Loki did it is the wrong way to do it.

1880
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:45,020
You do not start your first game being some overly ambitious project about cars

1881
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:47,660
getting into big wrecks, and then you don't end up finishing them.

1882
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:48,220
No offense.

1883
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:50,380
The game you did finish turned out great.

1884
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:51,100
There was no wrecks.

1885
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:58,460
But Bobby says, start with poker, start with hangman, start with flappy bird, start

1886
01:45:58,460 --> 01:45:59,820
with wordle.

1887
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:05,420
So wordle is just the flappy bird of 2022 is really what it is.

1888
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:06,300
And that's, that's it.

1889
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,220
So, all right.

1890
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,540
And, uh, Bobby bringing the technical explanation.

1891
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:14,140
I knew it was something, uh, it's not playable anymore due to the unity.

1892
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:17,420
Game player is no longer supported by browsers.

1893
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:21,100
So if you had an old browser or something, it might work, but, um, not likely.

1894
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:23,740
So, uh, dark to see it says I concur with Rob.

1895
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:27,500
Start with something simple, breakout space, invaders, that kind of thing.

1896
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,000
Yeah.

1897
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:33,260
Um, or build a game for a system that doesn't exist anymore.

1898
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:33,420
Right?

1899
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:34,060
Dark Sakura.

1900
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:35,520
Hmm.

1901
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:37,180
Yeah, there is that.

1902
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:43,260
So you had to say that right when I'm drinking, um, there is a game called eye of typhoon

1903
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:48,220
and, uh, it is, uh, being released in the United States.

1904
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:53,420
Um, it actually is, uh, a Korea, a South Korean game.

1905
01:46:53,980 --> 01:47:00,860
And, uh, not only is it going to be getting a PC release, it's coming out on the 3dio.

1906
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:04,300
Oh, guess who has a 3dio.

1907
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:07,420
I know you, you must have one.

1908
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:08,700
I think we have a 3dio.

1909
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:10,540
But is it hooked up now?

1910
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:11,420
Let me go.

1911
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:13,740
Bobby Black Wolf is your, of course he just popped up.

1912
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:14,380
I have a 3dio.

1913
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:15,020
Is it hooked up?

1914
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:16,560
It's okay.

1915
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:22,380
Bobby, Bobby, get close to the monitor, Bobby.

1916
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:29,420
I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell, uh, tell Dan that we need this game.

1917
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:31,020
No, I have seen Bobby's living room.

1918
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:32,060
It's, it's pretty great.

1919
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:35,980
Get Bobby to post a picture of the box collection from the seventies and eighties.

1920
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:37,580
That's the really impressive part.

1921
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:43,500
Well, we're, uh, we talked about actually Dan's thinking of selling the Mustang and

1922
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,100
we're going to convert the garage.

1923
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:45,740
Oh, wowee.

1924
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:47,100
That's a big step.

1925
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:52,060
Yeah, but we're thinking of converting the garage to our new game room.

1926
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:58,540
But who, who would have thought a new 3dio game in the year 2022, but this, this is going

1927
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:04,780
to be huge for, um, um, you know, somebody, no people that are in the retro scene, Genesis

1928
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:07,820
game that came out, that everyone was all hot and bothered over.

1929
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:09,020
And then it didn't play very well.

1930
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:15,020
Well, I mean, and people are making games for the Nintendo entertainment system and

1931
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,780
actually putting them on cartridges.

1932
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:21,820
Can you believe what a world who would do that?

1933
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:27,340
Uh, LM orchard and chat says, if I had a 3dio, it would just be the machine that plays Zelda,

1934
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:28,860
the Wanda Gamelon.

1935
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:29,100
Yeah.

1936
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:33,180
For five minutes until you were a member, how fucking terrible that game really was.

1937
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:38,220
I mean, that game exists to be in awesome games done quick and summer games done quick

1938
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:40,300
and, uh, and then that's it.

1939
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:45,420
Like it's a game does not hold up well in my, in my humble opinion.

1940
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:47,100
All right.

1941
01:48:47,740 --> 01:48:51,980
Uh, let's talk about something we hope doesn't hold up very well over time.

1942
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:52,380
Loki.

1943
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:54,140
Yes.

1944
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:55,180
Yes.

1945
01:48:55,180 --> 01:49:00,860
It is our weekly discussion of NFTs and how I just, okay.

1946
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:04,300
I want to point out Loki had like four stories about NFTs tonight.

1947
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,100
I said, you know what?

1948
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:10,060
Not today, Satan, not, not, not, not calling Loki Satan, but I'm calling, you know what

1949
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:15,260
Satan said not to, I'm burying this in part B of the show and you know what we can just,

1950
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:17,980
we're going to put it in one segment and then be done with it.

1951
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:24,060
I'm not going to talk about this half the show again, but please give us our update

1952
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:27,420
on these new fucked up things.

1953
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:28,300
Yeah.

1954
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:33,660
So itch.io, um, made a statement on Twitter talking about NFTs saying NFTs are scams.

1955
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:39,340
And if you think they're legitimately useful for anything other than the exploitation of

1956
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:44,380
creators, financial scams, and the destruction of the planet, we ask, please reevaluate your

1957
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:45,100
life choices.

1958
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:48,540
So that sums of that pretty well, I think.

1959
01:49:49,340 --> 01:50:00,140
Um, and then of course we had team 17 trying to license the worms for NFTs and then that

1960
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:02,940
got, you know, struck down pretty fast.

1961
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:04,860
People were very angry at that.

1962
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:11,580
And so they have decided to, um, not do that anymore.

1963
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:14,860
There's many people in chat by the way, cheering for itch.io.

1964
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:18,940
If you'd like to show your support for itch.io, you can go to the website and then search

1965
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:22,380
for tech master games and then buy the game that's available there.

1966
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:25,260
And that'll be showing itch.io that you support their stance.

1967
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:25,500
Right.

1968
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:25,820
Loki.

1969
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:27,340
Right.

1970
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:32,940
Um, so yeah, they, they decided to go ahead master games and then buy the game that comes

1971
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:35,580
up or just, yeah, search for pixel two summer too.

1972
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:37,180
Um, yeah.

1973
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:42,460
So apparently they have decided to, um, well, I grow crab games.

1974
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:47,900
Basically you put out a tweet saying that they believe that NFTs cannot be environmentally

1975
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:51,660
friendly or useful and are really just an overall grift.

1976
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:57,660
Please do not harass the employees at team 17 or devs under their umbrellas as this decision

1977
01:50:57,660 --> 01:51:00,940
seems to have taken everyone off guard and likely came from the very top.

1978
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:03,900
Um, which is unfortunate.

1979
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:09,340
Then of course, um, you have, you know, companies that are kind of changing their position on

1980
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:09,420
it.

1981
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:17,580
So EA, um, Andrew Wilson is saying now that, um, going from calling NFTs the important

1982
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:23,660
part of the future of our industry to, you know, walking away from them slightly and,

1983
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:24,860
you know, anything that brings.

1984
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:27,420
It's basically, let me try to see here.

1985
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:30,060
It says right now it's not something we're driving hard on.

1986
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:39,180
Um, you know, looking like needed to past, uh, capital fads around 3d AR and VR.

1987
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:44,940
Sony wants, or I should say meta wants to talk to you about their metaverse, you know,

1988
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:46,540
if you want to talk about fads.

1989
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:52,060
Um, by the way, by the way, random tangent, but it's, it's more important than, um, uh,

1990
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:54,140
NFTs and that's talking about poop.

1991
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:58,460
And Bobby Blacklove points out that pixel poops number two apparently came out a year

1992
01:51:58,460 --> 01:51:59,020
ago.

1993
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:03,420
Uh, the itch IO page says he bought it 357 days ago.

1994
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:05,900
I, what is time anymore in a pandemic?

1995
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:06,860
Did you know that Loki?

1996
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:07,820
It's, it's the birthday.

1997
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:09,980
How about that?

1998
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:12,940
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Bobby bought it day one.

1999
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:15,740
So that's, you know, that means yesterday was the first birthday.

2000
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:18,540
How about that?

2001
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:20,300
Happy birthday poop.

2002
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:25,420
Anyway, uh, back to NFT.

2003
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:26,860
Yes.

2004
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:30,540
And then, then of course you have the companies that are doubling down on it.

2005
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:38,300
And so Ubisoft course is, uh, gifting NFTs to their employees, which I'm sure really

2006
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:39,660
appreciate that.

2007
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:44,860
Uh, one of those is, uh, one to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ghost recon.

2008
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:49,740
Um, one developer said, you know, we hate this crypto stuff.

2009
01:52:49,740 --> 01:52:50,140
Okay.

2010
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:53,660
You know, with, um, Ubisoft saying, okay, come get some.

2011
01:52:54,380 --> 01:53:03,260
Um, they don't get it is basically the tone, um, that the developers think that they have

2012
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:05,100
with this whole Ubisoft reports platform.

2013
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:12,220
Um, again, I'm going to interrupt your NFT talk because, uh, it has come to my attention

2014
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:14,140
that my brain blue screened of death.

2015
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:18,380
Uh, when talking about the numbers there, uh, there's actually 365 days in a year and

2016
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:19,980
my brain did something with those numbers.

2017
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:23,500
So it's actually the birthday of pixel poops is February 13th.

2018
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:24,220
So it's coming up.

2019
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:26,780
So it's not too late to buy the game of cake.

2020
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:33,980
I mean, it came out like never was next week, but yeah, but I mean, Loki, seriously, you

2021
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:35,020
deserve a cake.

2022
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:36,220
So get yourself a cake.

2023
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:43,580
Um, and then last but not least, Konami remains committed to the future of the NFT market

2024
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:44,060
projects.

2025
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:46,060
So this is not the end.

2026
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:52,300
They will be producing more NFTs because they made money off of absolutely literally nothing,

2027
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:53,980
zero effort on their part.

2028
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:57,020
And so of course, why wouldn't they double down on this?

2029
01:53:57,020 --> 01:54:00,460
Besides, I hear the pachinko business isn't doing that great in Japan right now.

2030
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:03,020
So yeah.

2031
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:06,140
Um, all right.

2032
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:13,020
Every everybody with me on the count of three, one, two, three.

2033
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:20,220
Thank you.

2034
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:26,300
And as with that, we've purged the entities from our system.

2035
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:27,100
Thank you.

2036
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:31,340
Uh, Chad is suggesting that we have some theme music to go with this, such as Yakety Sax

2037
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:31,820
or something.

2038
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:37,580
I mean, those songs are copyright and I don't know, maybe there's some Pokemon music we

2039
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:38,060
can play.

2040
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:44,460
They'll play the team rocket theme or whatever the equivalent.

2041
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:47,580
Yes.

2042
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:50,380
Okay.

2043
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:50,700
Okay.

2044
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:54,780
I'll be, I'll be, when we get to the new setup, I'll be set up for that.

2045
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:59,740
So we'll do that team galaxy or whatever they were called in gen four.

2046
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:00,700
All right.

2047
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:02,060
Moving on.

2048
01:55:03,180 --> 01:55:05,020
Let's talk about something that's actually pretty cool.

2049
01:55:05,020 --> 01:55:09,580
Let's talk about, uh, finally PlayStation integration with discord.

2050
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:14,220
Um, now I kind of thought you could do this before you could already integrate like your

2051
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:19,580
PlayStation tag in discord, but now you can go a step further and discord will now show

2052
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:23,820
like what games you're actually playing on PlayStation four, PlayStation five.

2053
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:28,940
In fact, when you signed into discord recently, excuse me, sorry.

2054
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:32,780
Hopefully you'd have joined the vog network discord server, which is available at vog

2055
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:35,900
network.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord.

2056
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:39,500
That's one of those places you can send me messages throughout the week that create good

2057
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:42,140
topic ideas that then I want to talk about it on the show.

2058
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:43,820
Um, that's one place to message me.

2059
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:45,740
Um, or dark soccer.

2060
01:55:45,740 --> 01:55:49,260
If you want to talk about Deb by daylight or anything like that, or Loki, if you want

2061
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:53,580
to talk about Minecraft or how much you're watching his videos and enjoying them, uh,

2062
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:57,260
you can do that on our discord vognetwork.com slash discord, and you can also now connect

2063
01:55:57,260 --> 01:56:02,380
your PlayStation four and five, your PSN accounts to show what is it that you're doing.

2064
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:05,100
On your PlayStation will show on your discord profile.

2065
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:07,020
Maybe you don't want people to know that's okay.

2066
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:08,140
Cause you can hide that too.

2067
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:12,860
By the way, this functionality has existed for Xbox and the market for, for a little

2068
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:18,460
while now, but it's nice that Sony is there too, especially because we heard like a while

2069
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:22,540
ago that Sony and discord were doing like a strategic partnership kind of thing.

2070
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:27,820
So I feel like this is weird that it took this long to get here, but okay.

2071
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:30,540
Anyway, the pop-up has come up for a lot of people.

2072
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:35,020
So you probably saw it that way, but if you missed it, go to the discord app on your web,

2073
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:40,860
on the web browser or mobile, whatever, go to the connections section of the user settings.

2074
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:44,940
And then where all the other connected accounts are, cause you can connect your Twitch

2075
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:47,980
and all that stuff, uh, connect your PSN account there.

2076
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:49,660
Uh, and, uh, there you go.

2077
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:56,940
So, uh, we'll see what else comes out of that partnership that they formed back in May,

2078
01:56:57,580 --> 01:56:59,340
um, in the coming months.

2079
01:56:59,340 --> 01:56:59,840
Interesting.

2080
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:03,500
Especially because do you remember this?

2081
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:07,340
Remember at one point, Microsoft was going to buy discord and then that didn't happen.

2082
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:07,900
You remember that?

2083
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:10,060
That was only about a year ago that'll happen.

2084
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:12,140
Uh, they were going to buy them for 10 billion.

2085
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:15,100
Um, but discord is staying an independent company.

2086
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:15,900
So interesting.

2087
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:22,300
Discord in a blog post said we are excited to continue our partnership with PlayStation

2088
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:27,420
and explore how we can collectively create great shared experiences for your friends

2089
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:28,380
and communities.

2090
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:30,060
We'll see what develops.

2091
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:32,940
All right.

2092
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:33,580
Anyway.

2093
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:34,620
Uh, Oh, that's it.

2094
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:40,940
We're now to the listener round table where we invite your calls over at vognetwork.com

2095
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:41,900
slash discord.

2096
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:43,740
So there's another plug for that.

2097
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:47,660
Uh, you can join the green room and we will get to some calls if anybody decides to be

2098
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:48,940
brave enough to call in.

2099
01:57:48,940 --> 01:57:55,500
We also like to do emails, although I can't recall if I saw any, um, participate at orange

2100
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:56,940
lounge radio.com.

2101
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:58,380
No, no.

2102
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:02,860
So usually this would be the place where dark soccer and I talk about drag race, but admittedly

2103
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:04,220
I haven't been watching.

2104
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:06,220
So remind me of this case.

2105
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:11,100
I guess it'd be a good place to really talk about that Kickstarter that, uh, about drag

2106
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,060
her or whatever it was called.

2107
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:14,300
It looked pretty fun.

2108
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:21,260
I mean, the, the rewards on there though were, I mean, some of them got to be pretty big.

2109
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:27,100
Like if you spent like five grand that flight, you had to provide your own ticket, but they'd

2110
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:31,820
go to Los Angeles and participate in all this stuff and whatever.

2111
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:35,500
And I'm like, that doesn't sound like it would happen.

2112
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:41,820
Um, but I just, I just got the one to get my copy of the game.

2113
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:44,780
Um, it looks, it looks like fun.

2114
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:50,380
I mean, I wonder if you're going to have like the shade attack or the reading attack or

2115
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:50,780
something.

2116
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:57,500
Probably just a bunch of isms ripped off from drag race, which in turn was ripped off from

2117
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:58,380
Paris is burning.

2118
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:02,380
And, you know, it's just been, you know, it, it looks interesting though.

2119
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:03,820
I mean, I think it's going to be fun.

2120
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:04,220
Oh yeah.

2121
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,660
It'll be, it'll be cute.

2122
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:07,500
So yeah, I'll check it out.

2123
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:13,580
If it, if it ends up being, you know, actually something that, uh, that does reach its funding.

2124
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:17,740
I do have one thing I'll say about drag race.

2125
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:21,020
And again, we talked drag race because we didn't get any emails participate at orange

2126
01:59:21,020 --> 01:59:21,980
launch radio.com.

2127
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:26,060
So when we don't get emails, we assume the email says, tell us your thoughts on drag

2128
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:26,860
race.

2129
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:33,740
Now I haven't really been watching either series, but I will say this about UK versus

2130
01:59:33,740 --> 01:59:34,300
the world.

2131
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:35,740
That one that's airing right now.

2132
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:37,020
I'm going to say this about that.

2133
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:44,060
I done told you years ago, pangina heels is fucking hot.

2134
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:45,100
Number one.

2135
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:46,220
And it's fucking talented.

2136
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:50,700
Number two, I done said that on that podcast I used to do with, uh, captain spike and slide

2137
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:51,420
kick and Delvin.

2138
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:54,860
We had that show for a while and that was right when Thailand season one came out.

2139
01:59:54,860 --> 02:00:00,140
And I told you then hot, talented.

2140
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:04,940
And now, now y'all learning that watching UK versus the world there, there, there is

2141
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:06,460
no other queen than pangina heels.

2142
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:11,420
In my opinion, she's already been told, I already told you, I already told, I'm glad

2143
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:12,700
the rest of you caught up.

2144
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:17,580
Finally, I, in all reality, I'm actually thrilled that pangina heels gets a spotlight

2145
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:22,220
on this because, you know, unfortunately with drag race, Thailand, not being in English,

2146
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:25,980
let's, you know, be, I mean, it was great for people in that country, but people in

2147
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:31,180
us, Britain, Canada, couldn't really experience or get to know pangina heels.

2148
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:35,420
So I'm really glad that she has this platform for people to be able to get to know her.

2149
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:37,260
So I'm very glad about that.

2150
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:37,580
All right.

2151
02:00:37,580 --> 02:00:38,860
Yeah, there you go.

2152
02:00:38,860 --> 02:00:39,580
That's it.

2153
02:00:39,580 --> 02:00:40,140
Okay.

2154
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:40,780
Straight man.

2155
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:42,300
One more thing.

2156
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:43,100
What?

2157
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:49,180
The, uh, it's like something like a, uh, Twitch, uh, LGBT award that's going on.

2158
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:49,660
Oh yeah.

2159
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:50,140
I heard about it.

2160
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:50,940
We weren't nominated.

2161
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:51,500
How about that?

2162
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:59,900
Well, Evo though, who is, uh, a drag queen, uh, Dead by Daylight streamer has been nominated

2163
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:02,380
and was just recently, uh, named a Twitch ambassador.

2164
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:05,580
I saw, um, I lurk in her channel sometimes.

2165
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:07,420
She doesn't even know who I am, but I lurk in her channel sometimes.

2166
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:09,100
Holly got nominated for something with that?

2167
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:11,820
Uh, yeah, it's me, Holly.

2168
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:12,320
Yeah.

2169
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:16,700
I didn't see Holly on the, uh, there's two categories.

2170
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:18,220
One is like big streamer.

2171
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:21,180
One is like up and coming streamer and she's on the up and coming one.

2172
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:21,740
Yeah.

2173
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:22,240
Yeah.

2174
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:23,740
Holly's great.

2175
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:29,500
I really enjoy Holly's, um, Holly's streams, but I'll be honest.

2176
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:32,700
The person I've been spending a lot more time in lately, um, you know,

2177
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:35,260
apart from my usuals is, uh, the lady bird.

2178
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:36,640
Okay.

2179
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:38,860
Really, really fun.

2180
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:45,420
I actually got her husband as a survivor in Dead by Daylight once.

2181
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:46,140
It was pretty funny.

2182
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:49,260
I was like, wait, are you who I think you are?

2183
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:50,460
It's like, are you dark Sakura?

2184
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:52,220
I'm like, yeah, it was pretty funny.

2185
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:52,720
That's funny.

2186
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:54,220
Um, okay.

2187
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:59,100
So of course we open up this segment as well to, uh, your questions in discord.

2188
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:01,100
And, uh, there's a couple of questions coming in here.

2189
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:05,500
So let's start with Bobby Blackwell's question who says, is Dan getting a rush pinball yet?

2190
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:08,540
He didn't think it looked that exciting.

2191
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:14,860
I want it for the music, but honestly it, it didn't have a lot of the fun twists that

2192
02:02:14,860 --> 02:02:15,980
some of the other pinballs do.

2193
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:17,840
All right.

2194
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:22,540
It's, it's kind of middle of the road as far as a pinball goes,

2195
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:25,340
but I still want it for the music and the theme.

2196
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:25,840
Yeah.

2197
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:29,180
Um, as the show under Matt says, what's everyone's streaming?

2198
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:32,380
I was watching murderville this week, which has been hilarious.

2199
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:37,900
Uh, so not, not streaming games, but like other, I guess, media, uh, TV movie type of thing.

2200
02:02:37,900 --> 02:02:43,180
The book of Boba Fett or AKA the Mandalorian part two.

2201
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:50,540
Um, I don't watch a lot of TV, but I have been watching Australian survivor, um, who I think,

2202
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:53,340
and I know people have very strong opinions on survivor.

2203
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:54,700
They either love it or they hate it.

2204
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:55,500
And I get it.

2205
02:02:55,500 --> 02:03:00,540
But, um, I will say this Australia is producing a better show right now than the U S like I am

2206
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:02,700
so sold on Australia's survivor.

2207
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:03,980
It's so good.

2208
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:08,380
Uh, and this particular season has, uh, and I am a Sandra fan boy.

2209
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:10,220
I think she, she is the queen.

2210
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:14,620
And the fact that the fact that they got her to do the Australia version, I think is huge.

2211
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:17,500
And I just, I just love watching her and her daughter play in the,

2212
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:19,340
the rest of the cast is really good too.

2213
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:21,500
So props to a Australian survivor.

2214
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:26,220
That's what I've been streaming, quote unquote streaming, but secretly,

2215
02:03:26,220 --> 02:03:32,380
it's a secret group online that has links to pirate the episodes because paramount plus

2216
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:37,660
teased us with adding Australian survivor, but won't do it day and date as it's airing live.

2217
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:40,380
And the show like survivor gets spoiled very easy.

2218
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:42,300
So as far as I'm concerned, that's paramount.

2219
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:43,180
Plus is lost.

2220
02:03:43,180 --> 02:03:44,220
Yes, I will pirate it.

2221
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:47,180
Uh, I would have, I would have happily watched it on your platform.

2222
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:49,420
Paramount plus get with, get with the times.

2223
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:52,140
We live in a world environment.

2224
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:55,500
I don't know why, uh, Loki, what are you streaming?

2225
02:03:55,900 --> 02:04:00,460
Um, King of the Hill.

2226
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:04,160
Why not?

2227
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:07,340
Hey, streaming is to watch old stuff too.

2228
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:07,840
Why not?

2229
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:09,260
All right.

2230
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:11,980
It's either King of the Hill or a Barefoot Contessa.

2231
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:15,980
Why not both at the same time?

2232
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:22,540
Um, Dartitsuya says maybe a long shot, but has anyone checked out the Cotton reboot?

2233
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:25,900
The wife got it for me and it's the cutest shmup I've ever played.

2234
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:27,820
I've really been meaning to check it out.

2235
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:30,700
I haven't yet, but it looks super cute.

2236
02:04:30,700 --> 02:04:33,820
Uh, and I'm sure dark soccer has just now been reminded of it and it's like,

2237
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:34,700
I should probably get that.

2238
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:36,060
I have it.

2239
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:36,620
Oh, you do?

2240
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:37,500
Oh, what do you think?

2241
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:39,180
Yeah, it was gifted to me.

2242
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:40,940
Oh, love that.

2243
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:44,220
So, um, I haven't played it yet though.

2244
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:44,720
Nope.

2245
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:45,600
Get on it.

2246
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:53,200
Um, Cotton requires a certain amount of attention that I've been sorely lacking lately.

2247
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:54,560
I understand.

2248
02:04:55,600 --> 02:05:01,200
Uh, ZenMonkey11 says, uh, they're streaming Big Brother, which I got to, usually I'm into

2249
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:07,120
those, but the cast, the cast was so unexciting this year.

2250
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:07,620
Sorry.

2251
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,800
I just, I'm not interested in anyone on the cast.

2252
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:13,200
Sorry about it.

2253
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:19,440
Um, Sia Tiberius suggests the Barefoot King of the Hill or Contessa of the Hill.

2254
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:20,800
I like Barefoot King of the Hill.

2255
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:24,320
Uh, DJ Rama S says King of the Hill is a great anime.

2256
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:24,800
Yes.

2257
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:26,080
King of the Hills of Tatooine.

2258
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:29,360
All right.

2259
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,240
Uh, Loki, do we have any last minute stories tonight?

2260
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:33,620
No.

2261
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:34,660
No.

2262
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:35,840
All right.

2263
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:37,280
Let's, let's see what I'm talking about.

2264
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:40,400
I think someone robbing a bank with a Sonic the Hedgehog mask on.

2265
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:41,600
That's not gaming news.

2266
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:43,120
That's not gaming news.

2267
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:43,680
That's not gaming.

2268
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:44,720
That's a filler piece.

2269
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:51,040
I, and I actually, actually, you know, I will say for a minute, I, I think gaming websites

2270
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:57,440
and news websites that run with those types of headlines should really stop and evaluate

2271
02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:01,680
what is, what is the point of running with that type of headline?

2272
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:07,600
Or like a story that like is like talking about a YouTube video, like a singular YouTube

2273
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:07,920
video.

2274
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:11,680
Like I watched a, like, for example, there was one, I saw that they talked about Doug

2275
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:16,000
Doug's video where he does like silly challenges on Twitch all the time.

2276
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:21,600
And one of them was like, he's going to play, um, he's going to speed run Mario Odyssey.

2277
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:27,280
And every five minutes, he's going to add a HUD from a different game just to his OBS.

2278
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:29,520
And he has to like, look through all that.

2279
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:32,720
And it's just silly, but they wrote an article about that.

2280
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:39,120
But I, I just think in particular, the whole, like, Oh, this thing happened in the real

2281
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:39,600
world.

2282
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:43,760
And it just like had this very loose tie to gaming culture.

2283
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,800
I mean, gaming culture is like everywhere now.

2284
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:52,960
It's like the whole thing with Mario Kart, like anyone in their forties or younger grew

2285
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:58,160
up with Mario Kart and knows what Mario Kart is and played it at a birthday party at least

2286
02:06:58,160 --> 02:06:59,600
once in their life.

2287
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:05,360
Unless, I mean, you live in a very rural and or, you know, I guess in North America, you

2288
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:08,800
know, I realized the world's a big place, but you know what I mean?

2289
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,200
Like people know that type of stuff.

2290
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:14,720
So it's like somebody robbed a bank with a Sonic the Hedgehog mat.

2291
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:18,320
Well, big like people rob a bank with Mickey Mouse masks on.

2292
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:20,720
You don't see deadline reporting on that.

2293
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:28,320
Like, it's just, I just don't, I don't understand what that absolutely has to do with gaming.

2294
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:35,280
I feel like blogs and news sites try to say, Oh, look, it's like, it's proof that gaming

2295
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,280
is out there in pop co okay.

2296
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:38,080
We've been new.

2297
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:40,880
Like we know, we know gaming is out there in pop culture.

2298
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:47,440
Like, you don't, especially these negative things like robbing a bank, we don't need

2299
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:48,320
it pointed out.

2300
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:52,000
Sonic the Hedgehog gamers, they're just robbing banks.

2301
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,720
Now it's probably that grand theft auto teaching them to do that.

2302
02:07:56,720 --> 02:07:58,720
Sonic the Hedgehog fast.

2303
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:05,440
Sonic the Hedgehog was a highly successful movie franchise at this point and that franchise

2304
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:07,440
cause they're doing more than one movie.

2305
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,920
Like that is worth writing about.

2306
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:12,960
Do we need to talk about Sonic robbing a fucking bank?

2307
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,080
I don't think so.

2308
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:14,880
It's just silly.

2309
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:19,920
Uh, and Bobby in chat says, uh, yeah, they still have story quotas at Kotaku.

2310
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:23,360
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, it's usually a Kotaku writer fulfilling a story quota for

2311
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:23,920
the week.

2312
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:28,400
Uh, yes, it's easy to pick on them, but I see a lot of other places too.

2313
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:32,640
So sure we can start the conversation with Kotaku, but this is a problem all throughout

2314
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:33,200
the industry.

2315
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:33,840
Let's be real.

2316
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:35,520
Those types of like report.

2317
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:36,720
Cause, cause guess what?

2318
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,960
Kotaku ran with that headline.

2319
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:42,560
I'll bet you what there's, there's what?

2320
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:46,000
Probably hundreds of active gaming podcasts right now.

2321
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,000
I'll bet you at least a hundred of those gaming podcasts picked up that headline from Kotaku

2322
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
and they're going to talk about the bank robbery with the song.

2323
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,000
I guess we just did, but in a different context are going to talk about the article on the

2324
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:56,720
show.

2325
02:08:56,720 --> 02:09:00,800
And my, my point is why that has nothing to do with gaming.

2326
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:06,320
And I just think we need to, we just need to get above that.

2327
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:07,920
It's just silly.

2328
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:13,760
Uh, Zen monkey in chat says Mario and Sonic do a heist is the next switch game.

2329
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:16,320
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says grand theft Mario.

2330
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:17,840
See now you bitches are funny.

2331
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:21,600
Like if people are going to bring it up to be funny like that, then that's different.

2332
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:24,960
But you know, you know that, you know, the difference, you know.

2333
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:31,840
Anyway, let's just, let's just stop talking about the, it's, it's, it's, and honestly,

2334
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:37,520
it's along the same lines to me as, and this was what, just like three, four years ago,

2335
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:39,040
we would have those headlines.

2336
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:48,080
Uh, woman meets underage man on world of Warcraft and kidnaps him across state lines for like,

2337
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:50,960
cause I know that was a thing a couple of years ago.

2338
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:58,320
And it's just like, is, is that really about world of Warcraft or is that just about weird

2339
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:00,880
people doing weird things and illegal things?

2340
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:04,080
It's not about gaming culture.

2341
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:12,080
It's just gaming is that much in our culture that now all the ugly shit in our culture,

2342
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:15,360
like kidnapping, like robbing banks, et cetera, et cetera.

2343
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:20,160
Is now, you know, gaming gets tied into that stuff.

2344
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:26,800
Uh, pixel pockets and chat says reminds me of that headline this week.

2345
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:30,640
Here's the boat that won't bring Jeff Bezos hair or wife back.

2346
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:32,400
And I was like, that's Savage.

2347
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:33,140
Wow.

2348
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:36,800
When that's the head seat, but that's funny.

2349
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:43,680
Like again, if like, we're all going to be less irritated if it's funny.

2350
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:49,760
If the headline on Kotaku had been Mario and Sonic do a heist or whatever,

2351
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:52,960
I probably would have never brought it up here on OLR because I would have been,

2352
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:54,480
well bitch, at least it was funny.

2353
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:55,540
Right.

2354
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:58,100
Anyway.

2355
02:10:58,260 --> 02:10:58,760
Anyway.

2356
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:02,100
Yeah.

2357
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:05,380
E3VL says clickbait titles for sure, for sure.

2358
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:07,940
And then Facebook threatens to pull out of Europe and I'm like,

2359
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:11,140
why don't you just do the entirety of Europe a gigantic favor?

2360
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:15,220
They won't ever have to see another clickbait headline.

2361
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:20,840
Let's see.

2362
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:21,860
Oh yeah.

2363
02:11:21,860 --> 02:11:25,620
SJ100 Matt brings up the whole Kotaku story about magfest,

2364
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:29,380
where they claimed magfest refused to respond to the story.

2365
02:11:29,380 --> 02:11:32,180
Magfest showed the receipts that said otherwise.

2366
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:37,060
Yeah, because they gave magfest like an hour to respond before they ran with the story.

2367
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:42,100
And then of course they put magfest did not comment on this by a deadline time.

2368
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:46,180
And it's like, girl, that's shady.

2369
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:47,940
That's shady.

2370
02:11:47,940 --> 02:11:51,300
You need to give a company like magfest more than an hour to respond.

2371
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:51,800
Come on.

2372
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:52,920
Come on.

2373
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:56,040
Most companies when they get any kind of correspondence

2374
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:59,480
or contact are at minimum 24 hours to reply.

2375
02:11:59,480 --> 02:11:59,980
Yeah.

2376
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:04,520
I just, and I'm not, I'm not here trying to drag the entirety of games journalism.

2377
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:07,560
I'm just trying to point out, these are things we can probably do better.

2378
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:12,280
These are, these are things that do, do we really need this in our, you know,

2379
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:15,080
if we're, if we're gaming fans and this is gaming fandom,

2380
02:12:15,080 --> 02:12:18,360
do we need bank robbers in this discussion?

2381
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:19,160
I don't think so.

2382
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:22,360
Do we need NFTs in this discussion?

2383
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:27,480
That's a fucking lutely not, but at least I understand why that's coming up because it's

2384
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:32,360
in that context, it's bringing an awareness to these things that gaming executives are.

2385
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:36,360
We think that, you know, they're, they're being convinced and your favorite Hollywood

2386
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:41,400
celebrities like Brie Larson, Tony Hawk are getting pulled into a conference room

2387
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:45,080
and getting convinced by some shill that this is the next big thing.

2388
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:46,440
And they have to get in on it.

2389
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:46,940
Right.

2390
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,360
And they have to write a tweet about it.

2391
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:49,740
Anyway.

2392
02:12:50,700 --> 02:12:53,580
Okay, I'm off my soapbox.

2393
02:12:53,580 --> 02:12:54,940
That's what you get when you don't email us.

2394
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:57,100
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

2395
02:12:58,140 --> 02:13:00,380
That being said, we'll wrap up.

2396
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:05,260
We'll run into everybody's final thoughts, but first I want to thank you as always for

2397
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:08,540
listening to our show, whether you are here live with us on Sunday nights,

2398
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:11,340
or you were listening via the podcast feed on your favorite app.

2399
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:13,980
Thank you so much for doing that.

2400
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:19,660
And hey, either leave us a nice review, please, or tell a friend about the show.

2401
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:22,540
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice and we

2402
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:27,100
want more voices in the room so we can talk constructively about the things going on in

2403
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:29,260
our industry and not about bank robbers.

2404
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:32,300
We'll be back next week, of course.

2405
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:37,340
And then not here in two weeks as the show goes through some changes with the relocation,

2406
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:42,300
but it'll still be the same old good old OLR that you know and love.

2407
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:46,940
But I hope you will join us next week despite the concert bookended by that little ball

2408
02:13:46,940 --> 02:13:47,900
game on TV.

2409
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:50,780
I think that's it.

2410
02:13:51,340 --> 02:13:51,980
Dark Sakura.

2411
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:53,900
What is your final thought tonight?

2412
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:02,060
Keep your salty shit about no way out of my end game chat.

2413
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:03,980
All right.

2414
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:05,180
Have fun and Debbie delight.

2415
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:06,220
We'll see you in a little bit.

2416
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:06,540
All right.

2417
02:14:07,180 --> 02:14:08,460
Why is Debbie so delightful?

2418
02:14:08,460 --> 02:14:11,420
She's kind of a bitch lately because she because she did Dallas.

2419
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:15,500
And she's sore now.

2420
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:16,300
Bye bye.

2421
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:19,180
All right.

2422
02:14:19,180 --> 02:14:20,060
Loki, we'll go to you.

2423
02:14:20,060 --> 02:14:20,780
Your final thought.

2424
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:25,260
Final thought is I need to work more on Minecraft.

2425
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:27,180
I need to figure out some different things to do in there.

2426
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:33,020
So, um, my final thought is I'll probably do like one personal stream this week, but

2427
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:35,180
then I'm going to be on a little bit of a break because of the move.

2428
02:14:35,180 --> 02:14:36,540
I'm sure y'all can understand.

2429
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:40,780
But yeah, I'm really excited to getting to a new place in a new setup.

2430
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:46,860
S200 Matt, I think a good thought here too says mask up, get vaxxed and boosted, stay

2431
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:47,820
home when you're sick.

2432
02:14:48,460 --> 02:14:49,020
Right, Loki?

2433
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:50,380
You're staying home because you're sick.

2434
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:50,880
Right.

2435
02:14:51,740 --> 02:14:51,980
Yeah.

2436
02:14:51,980 --> 02:14:53,260
On a serious note, feel better.

2437
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:56,860
I'm sorry that happened, but I hope it's, it sounds like, has it been, it hasn't been

2438
02:14:56,860 --> 02:14:57,740
that bad, right?

2439
02:14:57,740 --> 02:14:59,100
Cause you, you got vaxxed and boosted.

2440
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:03,660
So it's just been, yeah, it's been, I mean, it's been like a, just like a cold.

2441
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:06,540
I mean, I don't know, like, but right now I just have that.

2442
02:15:06,540 --> 02:15:08,940
I mean, like the cough and phlegm phase.

2443
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:10,860
So I understand.

2444
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:16,060
I was wondering if I, you know, I've just had this most sore throat for like an entire

2445
02:15:16,060 --> 02:15:17,980
week and then that was it.

2446
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:19,100
This is weird.

2447
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:19,980
I don't know.

2448
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:20,620
Maybe it's nothing.

2449
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:21,760
All right.

2450
02:15:22,780 --> 02:15:24,460
That's I did take an at home test actually.

2451
02:15:24,460 --> 02:15:26,220
And it was negative, but I know those at home tests.

2452
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:27,660
Well, here's the funny thing too.

2453
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:30,380
I took an at home test too, and it was also negative.

2454
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:33,500
And then you took the lab test and it was positive.

2455
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:37,980
Um, well, my son took a test at school cause he had gotten a cold.

2456
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:40,140
So we thought, Oh, he just had what I had.

2457
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:42,700
And then he got some symptoms.

2458
02:15:42,700 --> 02:15:47,500
So he, we kept him up for a day or two just to, you know, until his fever went down.

2459
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:50,860
And then he got back to school and he had to take a test there before they let him in.

2460
02:15:50,860 --> 02:15:52,780
They're like, it's positive.

2461
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:54,300
I'm like, uh, dang it.

2462
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:55,980
Yeah.

2463
02:15:55,980 --> 02:16:02,620
But the one, the ones that like, dang it, the one, the actual, the tests actually at

2464
02:16:02,620 --> 02:16:05,900
like the hospitals aren't as good as the at home test.

2465
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:11,020
Cause the ones that the hospitals will detect it up to like 90 days after it's been in your

2466
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:11,900
system.

2467
02:16:11,900 --> 02:16:15,820
So like, it's not a good indicator whether you have COVID still.

2468
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:20,140
Um, it's just, if you've had it recently, um, but the at home tests, at least that's

2469
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:23,020
those pediatricians that said the at home tests are the way to go.

2470
02:16:23,820 --> 02:16:25,740
I don't know, but we'll see.

2471
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:25,980
All right.

2472
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:27,660
Well stay safe everyone.

2473
02:16:27,660 --> 02:16:32,540
I mean, it does seem like it sucks Loki that we're at the, at this finish line basically

2474
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:36,860
when it comes to Omicron and things are going down and lucky you, here you are.

2475
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:41,100
But hopefully, hopefully this is a sign of the, the, the thing.

2476
02:16:41,100 --> 02:16:45,020
Cause the, you know, the long-term stuff isn't a big deal.

2477
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:45,340
Yeah.

2478
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:45,580
Yeah.

2479
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:47,100
Here's hoping fingers and toes crossed.

2480
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:47,900
All right.

2481
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:48,620
That's it everyone.

2482
02:16:48,620 --> 02:16:51,340
We'll be back in seven days for episode 903.

2483
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:52,300
Happy gaming everyone.

2484
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:53,020
Have a great week.

2485
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:53,740
We'll see you next time.

2486
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:56,460
Hey, next week we get to celebrate one year of Pixel Poops.

2487
02:16:56,460 --> 02:16:57,980
So tune in next week for that.

2488
02:16:57,980 --> 02:16:59,740
The actual one year anniversary.

2489
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:00,620
Uh, good night everybody.

2490
02:17:00,620 --> 02:17:01,500
We'll see you next time.

2491
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:02,220
Uh, have a good one.

2492
02:17:03,580 --> 02:17:03,900
Oops.

2493
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:10,140
Maybe it would help if I hit the right button that says credits and not classic game B roll.

2494
02:17:10,140 --> 02:17:11,260
Let's try that again.

2495
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:12,140
Good night everybody.

2496
02:17:12,940 --> 02:17:15,660
