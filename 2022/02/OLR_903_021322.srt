00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,160
My favorite headline this week involves the current arcade machine renaissance. Those

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,800
that want an actual cabinet can get them, those that want a fractional scale model but

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,880
visually identical version can, and innovators can do fun, unique things too. Like NBA Jam

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,920
Shack Edition. Despite only ever playing as the Chicago Bulls and NBA Jam, reading about

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,080
this still put a smile on my face. This is just one larger than life story. Now it's

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,440
time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,720
rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. Another week of the show where

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,960
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:03,520
903 of our show for tonight, February the 13th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined by

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,960
my co-hosts at the keyboard at the moment. Say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. Hi Loki,

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,160
how are you doing? It's somewhat pain but I'm okay. Oh no, all right I want to ask about that

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,760
but quickly I just want to say DarkSakura is here. She had a cooking mama emergency in the other

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,840
room. So don't worry, Sakura is fixing it right now with the cooking. She'll be right back. So

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,280
but the pre-show video thing ended. I was gonna let it go like another minute and I was like well

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,320
this is awkward. I guess I'll just start the show. The joys of being here live because of course we

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,880
do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the

18
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,920
Bobby Black Wolf show. Not tonight though. Bobby Black Wolf is enjoying seven layer bean dip with

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,880
friends tonight. Oh hello there's DarkSakura back from cooking mama emergency. Hey DarkSakura.

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,120
Hey. Hey did mama fix it? My couscous actually burned a little bit on my pot so since it was

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,520
a very expensive enamel dutch oven. I had to get that scrubbed real quick before I put it in the

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,320
in the dishwasher. Thankfully I can dish wash it. It's fine but I had to get the burnt couscous.

23
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,480
But for people on camera I have chicken and carrot and black truffle and onion

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,920
and couscous with my homemade broth and I've added cheese because that's what you do.

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
Did you bring enough for everyone?

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,800
You should see how much I have. I have two containers of it in the fridge. I mean I used

27
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,520
all my couscous thinking oh this will make a little bit no no it made it made a lot.

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,360
I would say I'm coming over but things are a little busy with my move going on right now so

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,720
I've been talking about it for oh go ahead. Well if you want something to eat like on

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,320
Thursday I'm sure there'll be some left because Dan won't won't eat the couscous. I made it all

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,280
for me so I'll bring you some couscous. I've been talking about it for a few weeks on the show but

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,000
I am moving so Bobby it's interesting Bobby's not here tonight because of friends and chips

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,960
and traditions and things like that. The Owl show. Yeah the Owl show is on well actually I

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,720
hear there was a really decent halftime show I didn't I didn't catch it but I heard it was

35
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,200
pretty good so um so I guess there's that there's that that's usually the way it is there's a really

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,440
cool concert that happens once a year and then there's this little football game that they play

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,680
before and after it so apparently the concert kind of lived up to it this year so. Who cares

38
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,600
about sports ball? I know some people do whatever I find it's more traditions for a lot of people

39
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,560
but anyway uh so Bobby's not here tonight we won't be here next week because uh I'm moving

40
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,480
uh and I've been talking about this for a few weeks on the show so technically this is the

41
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,160
last night in studio N7. I haven't taken down any of the decorations yet um that'll probably be

42
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,400
tomorrow um but uh yeah uh this this studio we've been using this probably for the last seven years

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,320
I think is about as long as I've lived here and so it's interesting because the studio space saw

44
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,960
the end of our run on shoutcast which was audio only and um saw the beginning of twitch

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,240
uh for video which is funny because this space wasn't really set up for twitch but we made it

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,120
work and uh here we are now taping virtually which is what we're going to continue to do

47
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,440
uh in two weeks when we come back uh with our next episode uh where my my setup will change

48
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,680
drastically from what you see tonight I'm not exactly sure what it will look like yet but I

49
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,280
will say that Alan and I got to go to the house and actually see everything this week and it was

50
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,080
it was really cool I'm getting more and more excited so uh very very cool um I do want to

51
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,480
welcome those of you in our chat room and and big uh thank you as I see the hype train going on in

52
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,520
chat right now thank you so much to all of our live folks that are that are here despite the

53
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,320
concert and game on tv right now uh you all are here and super appreciate that but of course if

54
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,680
you listen on our podcast feed uh we appreciate that as well uh I want to go back to Loki real

55
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,520
quick before we get into the kickoff topic because I didn't I didn't catch what's playing behind you

56
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,920
tonight it looks like a Zelda game but like a DS thing what's what is what is that which which game

57
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:23,200
is it I can't tell from this far back is that is it Minish Cap no no which one it's Spirit Tracks

58
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,080
oh okay all right what made you say I did Dr Hatta well because the the DS Zelda games are

59
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,160
awesome and they really should bring them to the switch um like I mean when we're talking about

60
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,320
like how like oh yes it would be completely ruined if we brought like a game that Nintendo made to

61
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:50,560
mobile like Mario um whereas I think actually Zelda would work very well because it worked

62
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,720
well in the DS it was mainly using the stylus and so I that is a possibility I still wouldn't

63
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,400
want to see them come to mobile just put them on the switch but like you know it would still be

64
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,280
kind of cool yeah um going to our chat uh over twitch.tv slash vog network pod culture says uh

65
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:18,000
ah no more live shows ever never say never never say never ever uh on that note uh yeah Loki

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,880
brought up Nintendo uh and Zelda so I think we should probably talk about the big surprise

67
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,600
never say never to a new Nintendo Direct because once again we had no idea it was coming and then

68
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,480
you know in the middle of the week they said bam you're gonna get a new Nintendo Direct tomorrow

69
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,280
and uh it happened and I gotta say we'll recap everything they talked about but I've gotta say

70
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,720
um I couldn't watch it live which was a bummer um I just had work obligations which you know work is

71
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,320
more important um so I had to take care of that and then I was gonna watch it like on stream

72
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,560
delayed to get reactions but um I got twit or uh twitter notifications pushed to my phone that kind

73
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,960
of spoiled the big news uh so I was like all right I guess I'll just read up on it so I admittedly I

74
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,480
never watched the Nintendo Direct I just saw the bullet points but it still sounded like it was

75
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,920
a pretty action-packed good direct uh for all things considered it was I saw some folks online

76
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,560
that were very meh about it which kind of surprised me I thought there was a lot of good

77
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,520
stuff in it um but let's let's talk about some of the big headlines that were in the direct uh do

78
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,960
you have it up Loki you want me to talk about it yeah so it was it was all right I mean there was

79
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,760
some big announcements I guess there's a lot of games I just don't play the series of so it's not

80
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,000
like you know I was super hyped about things but you know overall they had some stuff I'm interested

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,400
in yeah there's lots of like interesting things on there like Chrono Cross yeah that's it's

82
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
interesting to see that and there's the Tel Aviv stuff that they have for that as well which is

83
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,240
kind of neat um you know that one was rumored you know for all the crap we get about reporting on

84
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,280
rumors sometimes that Chrono Cross I remember was a thing like four weeks ago because we were

85
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,360
wondering why are they doing Chrono Cross and they won't touch Chrono Trigger I remember that

86
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,120
discussion coming up a few weeks ago on the show um so uh it does seem like those Square Enix

87
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,800
remasters of like Secret of Mana you know and so forth are bringing fruit although I guess Chrono

88
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,120
Cross is not really a remaster it's just kind of repackaged for the Switch I suppose and I would

89
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,520
bet mobile I don't think they're gonna only have it on the Switch it's gotta be for mobile as well

90
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,720
because that's been Square's mo lately so yeah so they um showed off a Fire Emblem Three Houses

91
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:44,560
um Musou game so they've got Fire Emblem uh Warriors I guess or three yeah Fire Emblem

92
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,160
Warriors Three Hopes so I believe that's the sequel to the last game that they had come out

93
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,480
I feel like those Warriors games do pretty well on the Switch like you know obviously the um Hyrule

94
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,960
Warriors you know has done very well on the Switch there's the Persona one I'm just so sick

95
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,520
of Fire Emblem but you know some people like it so it's fine well I think what's it's gonna be

96
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,000
a completely different style for Fire Emblem too so you know I think I think it it works for the

97
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,320
Musou type of you know game so I think it'll be fun um what else so uh No Man's Sky is coming to

98
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,120
the Switch that's pretty interesting to see that actually happening I've been asked about my

99
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,280
thoughts on this one because I'm kind of the resident No Man's Sky fanboy a little bit um

100
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,400
and uh I mean it's I'm I'm all for more people getting exposed to the game and there are people

101
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,440
that will get to play it on Switch who haven't played it on other platforms yet um and I know

102
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,600
a lot of the concern is is it gonna run on the Switch it'll run on the Switch I mean it runs on

103
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,240
an OG Playstation 4 and an OG Xbox One it doesn't run very well um I would imagine they're gonna be

104
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,880
targeting a lower resolution especially when the game is handheld um so they'll probably be able

105
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,800
to do some things but I I I it's not gonna be ideal I don't think it's gonna be the ideal way

106
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,840
to play No Man's Sky unless your gaming is largely portable if you take transit a lot or you know you

107
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,720
just happen to play Switch in portable mode then hey having the No Man's Sky experience portable

108
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,600
will be kind of nice but I I don't think it'll be the optimal way to play it but I'm all for

109
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
more people um coming on board and I hope it retains the cross-play functionality

110
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:37,440
um because it'll be one of those few games uh that play across Sony, PC, Microsoft and Switch

111
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,920
so it'd be be pretty cool um we have a new Mario Strikers game so that's Mario Strikers

112
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,200
Battle League that's coming out in June 10th which looked kind of cool um those are that's

113
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,520
the series I don't really care about but cool yeah as we mentioned uh Chrome of Cross the

114
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:03,280
remasters coming to Switch on April 7th um there was the announcement of Mother and Earthbound

115
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,760
being added to Nintendo Switch online so for the NES and SNES finally I'm alive

116
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,720
makes me happy yeah Live Alive that's getting uh ported and remastered on the Switch uh which is

117
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,880
pretty awesome and I have like voice acting in there and stuff I'm just gonna say Live Alive

118
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:32,000
I think was the biggest and best news in the entire Direct. I'm gonna say why I think the

119
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,400
Live Alive was the biggest and best news it's because unlike the Chrono Cross one and some

120
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,720
of the other things we've seen Square Enix do and I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of toot on something

121
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:53,680
I said months ago on this show we're seeing Square leverage that um Octopath Traveler

122
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,080
slash Triangle Strategy Engine for something really different now and I remember I remember

123
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,560
when I brought this up it was when I was reviewing that game Dungeon Encounters remember when that

124
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,800
came out um a couple months it was by the uh minds behind Final Fantasy 12 kind of created

125
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,560
this very minimalistic RPG um and some people are super into it and I I just I liked it but

126
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,040
I didn't understand why it had to be minimalistic and I said they've got this engine why aren't they

127
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,360
using this engine to build more things and that kind of went into the talk about what if the

128
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,800
Final Fantasy remasters ended up in this engine or something like that you met right but well

129
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,000
it's not Final Fantasy remaster but I feel like it's something adjacent is now going into this

130
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,280
engine and I think that's really exciting um and I you know between that and the Chrono Cross news

131
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,720
I think we should all cross our fingers cross our toes hold our breath that that's why Chrono

132
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,760
Trigger is taking so long that Chrono Trigger is going to like maybe Live Alive is like a test

133
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,000
to kind of port these sorts of games over and maybe Chrono Trigger is going to get the Triangle

134
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,080
Strategy Octopath treatment um you know I know it's a it's a wild theory but I just think that

135
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,960
that was the most exciting news I think out of the whole direct I I it's interesting I know people

136
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:15,040
that really love that game um I I must admit I I know of it I don't I'm not very familiar with it

137
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,840
so it is you know especially for those of us in this you know in the states and you know North

138
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,120
America who have never uh really experienced that before except through a translated ROM it's almost

139
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,320
like it's a new product of sorts but I I think you know it's it's neat that Square is digging

140
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,920
into the vaults meanwhile Nintendo kind of does the bare minimum of finally putting their Earthbound

141
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,480
ROMs up on the service don't get me wrong I'm happy I'm thrilled for that that's great but of

142
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,800
course we're all sitting here going Mother 3 when and everyone's like and they're like nope and even

143
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,840
the Earthbound creator was out there on Twitter going I didn't know this was going to happen I'm

144
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,240
really happy that folks are getting to play this yeah I'd love to see Earthbound 3 happen too

145
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,800
you know is in this and then of course I'm sure Reggie was fucking teasing Earthbound 3 as always

146
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,200
or Mother 3 excuse me as always so it's just silly I'm glad I'm glad the um I'm glad the games

147
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,960
are finally where they need to be I'm glad they didn't put it on the plus version of the service

148
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:18,480
or anything stupid like that and I'm really glad about Live Alive yeah um some other announcements

149
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,040
that they had so they have um some collections coming to the Switch they're getting ported over

150
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,400
so there's a portal companion collection which is portal one and two uh there's also the Klonoa

151
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,320
series that's getting ported over as well uh front mission first is a remake of the first front

152
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,120
mission game that's going to be coming out on the Switch as well uh they showed off a trailer for

153
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,320
the salmon run next wave which is part of Splatoon 3 uh what else oh and Splatoon 3 is this summer

154
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,240
I didn't know I didn't expect we'd get it that fast to be honest yeah this summer um they showed

155
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,960
off a new trailer for Kirby and the forgotten land um so that looked funny with the uh mouthful mode

156
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,320
and what else a new trailer for triangle strategy uh which is kind of less exciting after the Live

157
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,800
Alive announcement then um some of the bigger stuff so now we're getting a Wii sports kind of

158
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,280
sequel with Nintendo Switch Sports which I could have done without their demonstration of

159
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:27,040
volleyball but um cool well this is that game where it's like of course like this is what we

160
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,760
should have had at the beginning instead of one two switch and it's kind of surprising you know

161
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,040
especially with how huge Wii Sports was and you know and in my brain I went boy they really should

162
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:44,160
have done this for the Wii U and I neglect oh they did oops but the Wii U kind of fizzled out

163
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,840
that fast I completely forgot and I think most people did let's be real so it's it I mean this

164
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,280
is one of Nintendo's biggest titles it's weird to think about but it is so it's nice that Nintendo

165
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,440
Switch is finally like getting its due with and it's one of those things where it's like oh of

166
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,160
course they had to announce this someday like this seems very logical that we'd get here at some

167
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,720
point I just really wanted to get some comments from chat real quick Mike Deft is talking about

168
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,840
Klonoa which I know Dark Sakura was excited about too and Mike Deft says yeah the Klonoa 1 is

169
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:19,680
running on the same base they used for the Wii remake but they're using the old models Klonoa 2

170
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,880
looks like a simple remaster which I'm fine with I'm so happy we got Klonoa again and Dark Sakura

171
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sure you echo that a little bit as well uh for getting Klonoa yeah um speaking of uh stuff

172
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,880
also being ported over I forgot about the uh Force Unleashed is being ported over from it's

173
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,680
the Wii version that they're bringing to the Switch which looks it's really showing its age um

174
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,520
what else uh so other bigger announcements Xenoblade Chronicles 3 coming to the Switch

175
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,120
in September looks amazing another one of those oh of course this would happen at some point I

176
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,760
think for me I was more uh impressed with the speed I mean this is something I wouldn't have

177
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,640
expected for a couple years but um actually it came up in Discord I uh I shared that comment

178
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,600
over on our Discord over at vognetwork.com discord I was kind of talking about that and somebody

179
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,720
did say you know the the chatter is that they actually started two and three around the same

180
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,440
time um kind of knowing they were gonna make a trilogy the whole time so this has just been sort

181
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:24,000
of um you know finished up after two released basically so we got the news that there's probably

182
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,680
not going to be a new Mario Kart 9 until at least 2024 that's because Mario Kart 8 is getting more

183
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:37,680
DLC 48 new tracks that have been ported over from a remastered I guess from other Mario Kart games

184
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:44,480
including Mario Kart Tour which is the mobile game so those are going to be coming this year

185
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:52,160
and in next year and it's like $25 for the DLC and of course they're throwing that into the

186
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,360
expansion pass as well but smart um not a bad deal for 48 tracks over the course of you know

187
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,640
few years but yeah I also I see it as them trying to sweeten the pot with their expansion pass

188
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,560
I think I think they're overcharging for what it is quite honestly especially with no new characters

189
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,120
I think they're really trying to push people to that pass because now yeah they've got that

190
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,920
they've got of course the Genesis and you know that the Nintendo 64 stuff and then they got the

191
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,160
Animal Crossing right so I think they're really trying to push yeah why can't they do more

192
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,480
characters like that I'm surprised that they're not doing that I don't know you know have you seen

193
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,840
a lot of the um you know discourse about that the tracks didn't look great in the preview some folks

194
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,000
thought they were kind of playing well they were like this they were at least the one example they

195
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,840
were showing like they completely changed the way it looks and it looks a lot more simpler

196
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:50,720
from you know it's not as nice looking as even the mobile version which I'm kind of surprised

197
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,440
well I mean to some extent like I understand a map like what Chaco Mountain was on there right

198
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,000
from the N64 I think that we saw caught a glimpse of that it looked all right yeah but I mean but if

199
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,040
you think about it the N64 that's the problem when you kind of upskill a lot of those old maps they

200
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,680
were playing because the N64 could only handle so much I don't think they were necessarily referring

201
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,800
to the Nintendo 64 stuff I think they're talking about the Mario Kart Tour maps um being kind of

202
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,320
like downscaled almost um I think the stuff the retro tracks are obviously going to look better

203
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,360
because they're based off older versions of the game and they have a lot more room to add detail

204
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,800
and stuff to it so it'll make it look nicer but when you take something from Mario Kart Tour which

205
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,120
is probably running I don't really know how well the mobile game runs or what the hardware

206
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,800
requirements are for that but like you know it probably has some better fidelity to it and a

207
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,440
little bit more detail in the models and stuff in the tracks and so they're probably not able to

208
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,560
pull that down into the switch and maintain a good frame rate so they're obviously going to

209
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,720
make some you know alterations that kind of do that and we're talking about like what it looks

210
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:04,160
like based off of an early shot that you know who knows when this is coming out and it's just like

211
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,720
a few second clips so it's very subjective right now um I think it's interesting though

212
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,360
especially with all the rumors about Mario Kart 9 which obviously I mean it could have been people

213
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,960
switch I agree HD yeah it's it'll be a launch title yeah Mario the next Mario Kart is going

214
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,160
to be for whatever Nintendo's successor to the Switch is it's going to be the next console I

215
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,840
think at this point Mario Kart 8 is kind of like the full life of the Switch and uh I think Mario

216
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,160
Kart 8 again and we'll just make Mario Kart infinity we'll turn the eight sideways you know

217
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:44,080
well honestly I think we'd all love a Mario Kart game that just encompasses every single track

218
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,880
right take the Smash Brothers get in there how many how many tracks are left take the Smash

219
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,240
Smash Brothers approach everyone is here right every character and every track from a prior game

220
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,800
why not seriously think about that because like if you look at it you know a lot of the tracks

221
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,720
in some of the other games I don't remember when they started recycling tracks a little

222
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,240
maybe that's DS um but like there's a lot of the other games have just tracks from other

223
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,800
titles in there like I can't imagine that we're left with many unique tracks from you know

224
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,880
just in general and also why can't they just make new tracks you know well did they say every track

225
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,160
was recycled or are people in every track because no it's what they said I thought there was still

226
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,280
room for new tracks interesting I mean they still could put more DLC out there I think that they

227
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,600
should put the pass out for the tracks and maybe have like some additional characters or something

228
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,040
that they should throw in there like I don't know I would have thought that maybe since Mario Kart

229
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,600
Tour kind of ended up fizzling maybe there were some planned things for that that they would push

230
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,480
over that's where I thought they might squeeze some new tracks from but I guess not interesting

231
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:01,280
all right anything else um no that's I think it I'm trying to think back if there's any other

232
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,320
announcements that they kind of showed off there was like some updates for Metroid Dread that's

233
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,480
going to be coming out so they have a few different difficulty modes basically a one hit

234
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,560
kill one hit death mode that's going to be a dread mode that's coming out soon and then also they're

235
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,040
having an easier mode that's in there as well and then they're going to be adding later on a boss

236
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,680
rush mode that's going to be coming I'm glad to hear that Metroid's getting a Bobby Black Wolf

237
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,320
mode that's great yeah yeah and then they showed off a new trailer for Advance Wars 1 and 2

238
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:38,480
reboot camp that's coming out on April 8th the only thing I wanted to comment on that I didn't

239
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,320
catch was the portal so they're doing like portal 2 on the switch basically I thought it was portal

240
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,000
one and two is a one and two well yeah it sounds like kind of a repackaging of the games which

241
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,320
you know those I mean don't get me wrong I love portal I love that series it's cool that it's

242
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,280
portable but it's also like who hasn't played it at this point but you know what would be neat

243
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:07,200
about it and I didn't see this to the point but there were also those fan released level edits

244
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,480
that I thought they went back and put on steam and it would be nice if the switch version included

245
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,760
those well what struck me as odd is that you know of course there's that whole like yay let's get

246
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:27,680
uh portal portable but we have the steam deck so it seems weird that valve is lending portal over

247
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,600
to the Nintendo switch when I don't think so I mean but portal would still be a great reason to

248
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,720
get a steam deck it's just interesting that valve is doing that that's all portal portal is old no

249
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,240
one's going to get a steam deck for portal yeah true I guess there's that I mean on top of that

250
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,920
how many different versions of the orange box do they put out and you know I I it should have been

251
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,160
the orange box well portal portal 2 has been released on everything and then they've had all

252
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,040
the the edits and everything portal 2 right now is old enough that it's not going to be a steam

253
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,600
deck seller what would be a steam deck seller is being able to have you know some of the current

254
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,600
biggest games that will work on the steam deck from multiple publishers that's what's going to

255
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:23,600
sell a steam deck or for people you know like me who uh doesn't have exactly a pc capable you know

256
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,800
system although I've worked around it and I don't need a steam deck now but that's what's going to

257
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,920
sell a steam deck um I don't think portal 2 is is remotely going to be in the ballpark of it

258
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,760
sorry interesting pod culture and chat says well I and to to be clear I'm not exactly saying like

259
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,920
oh god people are getting steam decks just for portal but I just think it's interesting

260
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:50,880
that valve is giving an exclusive to nintendo at this same time that they have a console

261
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,120
now that they're putting out basically that could benefit from all sorts of exclusives

262
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,560
so additional sales it's not even really I mean it's like it's it's a game that came out on the

263
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:07,440
xbox 360 you know that several years ago yeah I I'm not sure there's a huge audience for this to

264
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,560
begin with except for the fact that I and I think this is the reality too and something we all have

265
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,880
to kind of just is that there are going to be kids out there that were eight when portal two

266
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,400
first came out that are now approaching 20 uh that maybe are going to be playing these games

267
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,040
for the first time because they were a little young for it the first time I think there's

268
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,560
I think that's where the audience for these games are quite honestly as shona matt says don't say

269
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:41,520
that rob sorry I it is what it is I really think that's where the audience is um pod culture says

270
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,920
portal three would be a steam deck seller now that would that would be too easy for valve to do

271
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,480
but it wouldn't be just on steam though it would be on and we know that they can't count to three

272
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,200
anyway well that is true how long did it take capcom to learn how to count to three

273
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,000
a long time but yes steam deck is not isolated in its own world but still even just the fact

274
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,160
that portal three you know all these years later is still not a thing is interesting to me but it

275
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:17,360
is what it is valve has their plan I guess so all right well I I thought it was a very solid

276
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,080
nintendo direct at the end of the day um a lot of good announcements I thought there was some

277
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,520
really good surprises in there especially the live alive and you know chrono cross and just

278
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,880
clano a lot of good stuff coming back and a lot of um you know forward-looking stuff I think the

279
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,480
mario kart tracks was kind of a surprise um splatoon 3 not being holiday but paying for

280
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,720
their service I mean like I know it I know it's like kind of stupid just to buy it outright but

281
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,280
I'm going to buy it out right I'm not supporting that expansion pass service yeah I'm I'm still on

282
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,520
the fence I mean honestly I'm not playing enough mario kart 8 I'm not sure I would even get the

283
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:00,640
tracks it's I'm on I'm on jds plan so I spent so little on it anyway that it doesn't matter

284
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,200
there you go all right well let's talk about the types of things that we are playing this

285
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,400
week nintendo switch or otherwise in how was your gaming week so uh we'll start with dark

286
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,920
sakura how was your gaming week what do you been playing this week I played stuff um of course dead

287
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,560
by daylight um they've disabled nurse which is kind of uh weird for me because I said after rank

288
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:30,160
reset which is what today yesterday today yeah that my plan was to go back and practice nurse

289
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,880
a lot more um although what I'm also doing is uh I've got my first p350 which is freddy

290
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:45,440
oh congrats um and I finally decided to prestige pig um so now I am doing nothing but putting all

291
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,160
of my points on um in in uh miss pigu so that I can uh uh make her my second p350

292
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,880
and for those who don't know um every time you hit 50 you can prestige but you can only

293
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,560
prestige three times and then you get another achievement when you hit 50 on prestige level

294
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,280
three I've also figured out how to rip the models from dead by daylight now and import them into

295
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:16,400
blender I saw you tweeting some of this stuff it was interesting yeah they actually redid pig's

296
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:23,520
face when they put out the new cosmetics so before that um her face was just sort of like almost kind

297
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:31,120
of flat and now um she actually like like for the the head actually goes with that outfit that I

298
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,720
have on her there's a different head for the mask uh you know the mask with the bear trap crown

299
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,840
right uh mask the bear trap crown has like a sort of a shaded kind of like under the batman mask

300
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,400
sort of makeup thing her regular face is all covered in blood um which she didn't even get

301
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,160
that bloody in the real movies hell even when she got shot in the neck she didn't get that bloody

302
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,760
um so uh I I thought it was really really interesting um I still haven't figured out how

303
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,760
to get the the skeletons imported right so that I can use some other animation stuff but really

304
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,800
my goal is just a converter to a uh a v tube thing anyway um and I'm going to be trying to edit the

305
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,280
the face mesh to uh to look a little bit more realistic I'm going to stylize it quite a bit

306
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:25,040
but right now I've got my first work done and I'm also going to rip uh a meg in the pig mask

307
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:33,200
so I don't have to animate her face interesting okay so um actually I tried to apply Jill's face

308
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:42,960
to to pig and the survivor's heads are a little bit smaller so um the eye holes are like here

309
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,400
like right where normal eyes are and then like the actual eyeballs just so you know oh is it

310
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,800
yeah oh crap okay sorry so the eyes would be like right here um you know we're normal the eye holes

311
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,520
would be there but like the eyeballs themselves since the eyeballs are part of the face mesh

312
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:06,080
are like under uh like where the cheekbone would be whereas you know amandas are like right in the

313
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,640
right place so I kind of need to figure out how to I haven't done mesh editing except for like

314
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,080
v tube studio which is really simple so this is going to be a test of my skills so wish me luck

315
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:27,040
but my eventual goal is to get Jill's face um applied over amanda's uh uh mask

316
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,280
so that at least it's a decent looking face so anyway um and going I also need to double check

317
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,240
what uh what eye color Shawnee had the I forgot her last name but she was the actress that played

318
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,560
Amanda and Saul so I need to look up her eye color and make sure that there's the right one so anyway

319
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,360
um going though to other games I've been playing of course I did Fantasian which I have Fantasian

320
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:59,920
Friday and uh I had to restart on a couple of things um and I also started doing a retro stream

321
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,240
on Saturday night after work and I played The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past and I have

322
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,000
lost a lot of skills in that game because I haven't played it in 10 years so and he was like oh where

323
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,200
was this shit where was that shit do I get this or no I can't get the Zora thing because I need to

324
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,760
get the glove and so I'm on to getting the glove although I finished the first palace um I always

325
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,160
never know what to call what was his name like Sahasrallah the the old man so I call him

326
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:35,840
Sarsaparilla that works I call him Scheherazade once but Dan and I do that is like if we find

327
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,920
someone with a kind of a complicated name even though we can pronounce it we still kind of screw

328
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:48,960
it up um and then uh I actually have a translated copy of Live Alive that I intended to start

329
00:31:49,680 --> 00:32:01,200
until the direct came out um the timing so right um and I also uh played Radiant Silver Gun

330
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:10,560
for Saturn fun on my Mac oh fun yeah I um I've managed to get PC Engine and Saturn games

331
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,400
and I think I might be able to get a Playstation 1 to work next I'm still trying to find Robit

332
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:23,440
Lundu which I would prefer to have an original of mine but you know I'll play it any way I can

333
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,440
games like older than some people I know um and then of course you know I played wordscapes

334
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:37,920
because that's what I do and just yeah watching friends play stuff trying to see what's interesting

335
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,840
you know some people are playing that Lost Ark I can't play it so oh and of course Mass Effect 2

336
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:51,440
which I was able to get running in my uh my parallels oh fun so I also got my uh my

337
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,080
SteelSeries controller working yay my old one my Nimbus I'm sad I missed your um retro stream I was

338
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,280
hosting like my gaming week is a little thin because I was hosting um show shows are starting

339
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,560
to come back um with precautions but I was hosting uh last night or yeah last night was

340
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,800
Rocky Horror and then two nights ago was a burlesque variety thing so I was very busy

341
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,920
out doing that but I know why you uh messaged me that you were gonna do it I was like oh darn

342
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,200
uh I would have watched while I was packing boxes if I wasn't out and about so

343
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,520
well I'm kind of getting to the point where I'm just gonna throw up the cheats on it just because

344
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,160
really I'm playing it for the experience of playing the game and yeah I don't care I I'm

345
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,480
at least using the save states because you know when you die you start over and there's one battle

346
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,200
that even when I was super good at the game still always gave me problems and that was that big

347
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,320
stupid giant worm that's in the second is in the second or third yeah yeah I hate that thing um

348
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:55,440
and uh I don't even know what it was but I always would just like it would take me for like even

349
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:03,440
the newer one the link between worlds that gave me fits too it was a pain in the ass yeah so

350
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,840
I'm just like I'm just cheat to win I don't care I'm playing for the story it doesn't matter I'm

351
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,760
the one playing the game if anyone has a problem with it fuck you all right I'm the one playing

352
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,640
the game and you're not you don't you don't know anyone you play you play the way you want on your

353
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,040
stream and that's they don't like it they go somewhere else it's just been like lately I've

354
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,320
seen a slew of people like complaining about how people are enjoying things I'm like it's not

355
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:39,520
hurting you yeah fuck off seriously I I I am like right now at the point where I'm just like I don't

356
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,680
give a shit I'm the one playing it you can deal with it there you go all right let's go over to

357
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:54,320
loki how was your gaming week um so it's minecraft um but it's also I finished playing well as of

358
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,880
right now because they're constantly updating the game but I have completed the entire game

359
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:08,000
of power wash simulator oh wow things have been power washed now congrats so yeah that that was

360
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,040
fun um but now yeah I wish there's more to do in there um and then minecraft have been extremely

361
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:22,000
busy the last week or so so I was working on a sorting system and storage system so that was

362
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,240
kind of this entire week and I'm putting together my new episode well I started it this morning so

363
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:36,320
I should be hopefully out in the next couple days all right um that's it my gaming week as I

364
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,920
mentioned was a little bit slower just with all the other commitments going on I did still play

365
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,840
way too much dead by daylight um I got my adept Claudette achievement today so yay yay I got fanged

366
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,920
to level 10 so I'm gonna get hers next so just kind of working my way through those for no

367
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,800
particular reason it's just a fun I need you to still help me with my Michaela adapt yeah sure

368
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,720
just um but I don't want to lose my 100% survival rate uh well then don't play with me because I

369
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,160
have had some sweaty ass I had a basement bubba today I haven't seen that gag in like six months

370
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,200
and I just forget how exhausting that is to like go down there and rescue someone in the basement

371
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,960
and then and it's like oh fucking really I have to tell you I thought of a way to do um a uh like a

372
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,600
you know basement uh pig but I was gonna call it um like a pantry pig and I decided instead

373
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:34,960
to call it basement bacon okay so more on that later all right um and then I've still been

374
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,160
playing Final Fantasy 14 been pretty much capping my red tomes every week and working on my gear

375
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,160
for my gunbreaker which is kind of my main class class that I play in that game uh and then

376
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,600
otherwise playing gps games um ingress started their second sunday mission thing officially

377
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,960
they've been kind of doing it unofficially for a few months now and now the official one started

378
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,760
this month today with the new badge so you know the the walking incentive stuff has been really

379
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,760
good um I guess I haven't really mentioned this on olr I've talked about on social media but you

380
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,880
know I've talked about some of my health issues um over the past few months um I'm down over 30

381
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,960
pounds at this point um with all the changes that I've made since that happened and you know

382
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,640
honestly awesome the gp I mean obviously I've been working very hard with you know diet and all that

383
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:23,840
stuff too but the gps games Pikmin um ingress pokemon go which I actually picked up again which

384
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,920
I hadn't played in a while those have been huge in like gamifying steps so that I actually get more

385
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,080
steps every day so that I really push myself to go out on a walk and things like that is uh very

386
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,280
uh very big thank you I see the kind words in chat yeah it's funny um somebody came up to me

387
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,200
after a rocky last night and was like oh yeah you you look great I saw you in October and yeah I

388
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,160
could tell that you'd put on COVID weight you know I know it was well intentioned because she was

389
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,360
like we all have you know she's got that kind of thing uh and then she was like oh but you you're

390
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,240
looking great and it's it's nice it's a very nice thing um and I didn't I didn't want to tell her

391
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:09,440
like well I got diagnosed with diabetes and it really whips your ass into gear but we do also

392
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:18,160
need to stop uh you know what's the word I'm thinking of equivocating um size with with

393
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,000
aesthetics right and the person I was sitting with who kind of listened all that because I

394
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,720
kind of actually leaned in their ear and I said I should have said I should it's a good thing I

395
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,000
didn't say oh I got you know the type 2 diabetes will do that to you um and then my friend actually

396
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,080
said this is why I don't comment on people's bodies because you don't know people's stories

397
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,760
you know and I that's that's kind of my approach too I don't I'm always I'm always afraid I'm

398
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,400
going to say something like oh you've lost weight and then shock they gained it and I'm just an

399
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,560
idiot you know so I just try not to comment on that sort of thing at all unless some somebody

400
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,920
else tells me first oh I've lost weight or oh I'm trying to put on weight for whatever it's like oh

401
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,720
congrats are you meeting your goals okay cool good for you I like to tell tell people that

402
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,640
they're looking healthy yeah exactly you know not necessarily whether or not they've lost weight but

403
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,200
if I see that they've got a glow to their skin and they're energetic like oh you're looking really

404
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,360
healthy today yeah there you go you know because that is completely independent now if they happen

405
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,160
to have lost weight in order to improve their health then that ties in with it happy for them I

406
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,960
mean I'll be honest I was feeling a little bit shallow when I lost all that weight with my

407
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:38,560
surgery but you know it's size isn't a judge of health totally agree and I you know I it's one

408
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,280
of those things where weight loss is a very nice side effect of all this other bullshit and that's

409
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,760
kind of just how I've explained it is that you know I'll take it this is far said if I'm gonna

410
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:54,560
work hard sure I'll take weight loss why not it's fun all right anyhow let's move on we're gonna

411
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,800

it play it myself but I said I'm gonna wait till after this moving stuff to get sucked into this

421
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:58,640
so Loki tell us about this yeah so the new uh I guess new for us MMO lost arc has reached a record

422
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:08,560
number of players on steam with 1.3 million online at peak and that is the third most game or played

423
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:17,280
game in the history based off active concurrent players um just not bad not bad at all um and

424
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,400
then of course I guess also well I actually now as of when we're looking at this I think it even beat

425
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:36,160
out um csgo because csgo had their record was uh 1.3 it was like 1 million 308 000 and I think now

426
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:44,960
they're just past that as well so uh pub g's through the roof right because you know when pub

427
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,240
g yeah like g's like 3.2 million three fortnight there were a ton of people playing uh pub g so

428
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:57,840
yeah so uh not those numbers anymore but yeah at its heyday it was you know pretty high up there so

429
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,960
um that's pretty great for a brand new mmo for lisa the us and europe I know this came out

430
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,760
originally in south korea in 2019 but um yeah it looks pretty cool well you know it's um I can't

431
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,240
take myself into an mmo at this point it's it's free to play which is you know that's a huge part

432
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,080
of why a lot of people are able to get into it um amazon has been doing a huge push through twitch

433
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,040
you know you probably saw an ad for lost ark before you got here on olr tonight um because

434
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,440
you know well that and that's smart that's amazon leveraging you know the fact that they run twitch

435
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,440
to put in some ads and you know get the hype going for this game which also seemed to work

436
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,200
well for new world uh you know even the new world kind of went like I feel like new world was very

437
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,560
much a flash in the pan so that I know it sounds really harsh but like honestly like it came and

438
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,680
went like sorry to fans of that game you know you don't need my validation to have fun with the game

439
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,040
but it just definitely seems like you know lost or new world was kind of you know the it girl for

440
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,160
like a weekend and then suddenly you know faded out real quick so I'm curious what the staying

441
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:10,080
power of this is gonna be if this ends up you know going ended up being a tide that comes in

442
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,760
really heavy and then recedes really quick or if this really does end up being something that

443
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,680
stays around and that's part of the reason I've been waiting a little bit to jump on board with

444
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,200
it I mean my personal life doesn't really give me the time right now to download fight queues and do

445
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,040
all that with something new um but you know if it's still relevant in a couple weeks and my

446
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,520
friends are still playing it uh I would definitely want to check it out um looking at some comments

447
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,560
from chat quest buster says launch was also delayed by several hours because of the demand

448
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,600
on the 11th but founders were able to get in a few days before that quest buster continuing uh who

449
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,920
also had commented that they've been playing a lot of it this week um it's a ton of fun but the first

450
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,720
few hours are a bit slow they tightened some of the experience up from what I had played from

451
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,560
the Russian version so it is also interesting that a game that's technically already existed

452
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:06,400
for quite some time yes in other parts of the world and other localizations it's interesting

453
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,880
that it's so popular and now I'm curious to see because of this what else is going to suddenly

454
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:20,720
show up that's been out for a long time in other places we'll see any interest in lost ark uh

455
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,520
I think dark soccer already said pass but loki did you you have any interest in lost

456
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:32,640
art no I I can't jump into it well I can't oh oh there's no uh mac even though yeah it's not

457
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,360
I don't think it runs on windows arm either oh bummer all right all right well moving on let's

458
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:46,160
talk about call of duty because of course with the pending purchase of microsoft to

459
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,920
buy activision blizzard a lot of people have been presuming that call of duty is going to end up an

460
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,840
exclusive and it certainly would make a lot of sense that it would go that direction however

461
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,160
this is very interesting the president of microsoft brad smith made a blog post saying

462
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,120
microsoft will continue to make call of duty and other popular activision blizzard titles available

463
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:13,040
on playstation through the term of any existing agreement with activision and we have committed

464
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,480
to sony that we will also make them available on playstation beyond the existing agreement

465
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,840
and into the future so that sony fans can continue continue to enjoy the games they love

466
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:28,880
we are also interested in taking similar steps to support nintendo's successful platform

467
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,520
we believe this is the right thing for the industry uh for gamers and for our business

468
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,040
uh many folks that are a little more skeptical about these sorts of things and i don't blame them

469
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,720
thinking that this might be microsoft's way to sort of respond to the fact that the ftc is all

470
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,200
up in this business uh for the approval of the takeover and so forth so perhaps um sony or

471
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,400
excuse me microsoft committing to supporting sony platforms is um gonna help them get through this

472
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,280
i guess or what have you um now maybe i'm just being a jerk but i don't think i am i would still

473
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,240
be highly skeptical of all this not i call of duty will come out for playstation you know if

474
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,480
they said it they're gonna do it but it doesn't mean it's gonna be the version you want because

475
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:24,160
i think we're definitely gonna see the extra maps extra characters extra stuff is going to be the

476
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,160
definitive version will be the microsoft version the sony version will be an afterthought uh

477
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,440
as will honestly probably nintendo's um just because of the limitations of the platform

478
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,800
now of course in a couple years when we're talking about nintendo's successor platform

479
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:46,960
that's a different conversation but um i i i still think microsoft would be foolish to not

480
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:54,560
have call of duty be the must play experience on their own platform and will sony do the same

481
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:00,080
thing with destiny and whatever bungee has cooking for the future abso-fucking-lutely

482
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,040
abso-fucking-lutely and of course microsoft also gets call of duty on game pass which is going to

483
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,040
be huge and they can continue to charge 60 bucks on playstation at launch i think a lot of it is

484
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:19,120
just that illusion of supporting everything equally um and i'm not so sure it really is

485
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,120
but i guess that's nice for people that never ever want to get a

486
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:31,600
xbox or play on their pc i suppose so all right let's move on dark sakura

487
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:40,960
i had to unmute my my mic every time i click it it actually immediately remutes itself is so weird

488
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:49,200
any rate um i remember going to e3 and always finding like the america's army area and they

489
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,360
were like always like oh play play this you'll see you know and then and then sign up for for

490
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:03,440
the rest of your life um well they and honestly it was a really revolutionary idea to use a video

491
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:12,080
game as a recruitment tool 20 years ago um now though they have uh uh you know it's free to play

492
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:17,600
it was really successful a lot of people said it was really fun but as of may 5th this year they

493
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:27,440
are going to shut down the servers and uh it's going to be retired so uh it i mean the the thing

494
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:33,040
with this particular with this particular game and and something like it is that it really was

495
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:38,960
a novel concept when it came out you know yeah we all knew oh this is a recruitment tool but

496
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:46,000
it also was supposedly a really good game i mean right and i mean we had so many different you

497
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,200
know military related games come out over the years but you know america's army was only supposed

498
00:48:51,200 --> 00:49:00,640
to last for seven years but it was so successful that they uh actually the pentagon approved

499
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:07,440
spending more than three million a year to uh to promote the game and expand upon it

500
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,040
um i mean and right now the uh their recruiting budget i think is like eight billion

501
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,520
so that's not i mean that's only a small percentage of their recruiting budget but still

502
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,440
it is a big chunk of change um and then they said you know there was a study in 2008 from

503
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,680
uh the massachusetts institute of technology so mit um that said that thirty percent of all

504
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,760
americans ages 16 to 24 had a more positive impression of the army because of the game

505
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:44,720
and the game had a large impact on recruiting so it was clearly successful i mean the army has a

506
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,160
twitch channel well yes i know about that but that that hasn't always been good news because

507
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,800
that was the one where people were going in there and asking about war crimes and so they would get

508
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,480
banned but then it was like well the government can't ban people it's freedom of speech right so

509
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,360
it started that whole interesting conversation and how there are protocols on that but um going

510
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,320
back to the game itself yeah i mean i've i've heard i've i've no interest in the game i'm not

511
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,400
going to play it or or really cover it on this show beyond these um interesting pop culture

512
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:20,640
uh and gaming culture notes but um everything i've heard is that for what it is you would expect

513
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,440
that it's a shitty game usually these types of games are pretty shitty like you know when

514
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,720
corporate corporations and the army in a sense is a corporation trying to catch the corporation

515
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:37,040
yeah trying to cash in on what the cool kids enjoy right is usually kind of doesn't work out very

516
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:43,200
well but apparently this was a pretty decent game from what i heard so um that's part of why it was

517
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,840
successful is that you know and and i realize people have their criticisms and and it's fine

518
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,800
but it seems like the people that were making this game were actually listening to what gamers kind

519
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,560
of wanted to play and actually developing a game that would be fun and not what like research

520
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,960
groups said would be fun a boring recruitment tool isn't gonna it won't recruit anybody

521
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:12,720
right so well the other thing too is like the federal aviation administration um had a hiring

522
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:19,280
campaign they were looking for 4300 air traffic controllers in about five years and they focused

523
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:28,160
on gamers and they met they i think supposedly are already well on their way to um to hitting

524
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:34,080
their goal but a lot of you know these different institutions now are eyeing

525
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:44,240
games and gamers for their their hiring base you know because certain skills hand-eye coordination

526
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,080
you know of course would carry over and then they also you know can judge mindsets by what type of

527
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,480
games people are playing you know so there's a lot of you know very interesting psychology that goes

528
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,120
into it but you know and of course there's also then putting out you know i call it the the last

529
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:07,680
star fighter syndrome who all remembers that movie it's been a long time where you know they put out

530
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,840
the arcade machine and it was a test to see who was going to be the next star fighter um and then

531
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:19,120
then the guy gets kidnapped and goes to outer space and you know and then his robot twin makes

532
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:29,920
out with his girlfriend but anyway um they're using different games also as sort of uh disguised

533
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:37,040
tests for certain skill sets and so you know i i just still think it's very interesting that

534
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:42,800
we have so many government facilities that are like oh games are bad and the army's like fuck

535
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,400
yeah games yeah we're gonna use these games we're gonna get some more some more grunts i had no idea

536
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,320
about the air traffic controller thing and then i think about like something like flight simulator

537
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:58,560
where it's like okay maybe flight simulator is not anything like actually flying a real plane

538
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:04,880
but it really is educational as to what all goes into it like if you actually play flight simulator

539
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,320
on you know simulator mode you're really thinking about especially this new one that Microsoft put

540
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:15,360
out not that long ago um really gets into the weeds on like here's everything that goes into

541
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,480
takeoff and you're taking classes at your computer basically um and again i'm not trying to say that

542
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:26,640
like oh i played flight simulator i can fly a real plane suddenly no but you'll have an absolute leg

543
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:33,040
up on somebody who's never uh touched that you know if you were to uh want to take actual you

544
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:41,200
know plane flying classes so uh very interesting uh with gaming as a recruitment so i'm going to

545
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:47,280
our chat for some additional comments sg100 matt says geez 22 years old since this was in beta i

546
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,840
remember seeing america's army at digital life i wouldn't have guessed it was still going on yeah

547
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:58,880
i thought it had faded out a few years ago but i i felt it still had an impressive run um so you know

548
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:06,480
i mean i again games like this usually come out are laughed at and fade away within a year so the

549
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:11,920
fact that this one lasted over 20 years pretty fascinating to be honest yeah yeah and with

550
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:19,600
constant development so pretty cool yeah pretty cool all right let's move on loki all right so

551
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,800
of course with all the acquisitions that microsoft is making everyone is kind of asking so you know

552
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,640
all these games go in the games pass isn't that gonna raise the price of games pass you know it's

553
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,320
gotta happen at some point because where's all this money gonna come from that they're buying

554
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:40,240
all these companies with well apparently phil spencer was trying to kind of uh point out that

555
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:46,080
no no no no they don't have plans right now to raise the price of game pass um so kind of

556
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,400
addressing the rumors that it was going to go up in price i feel like i can't prove this negative

557
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,560
um people ask one is the game pass price going to go up they're buying all these studios you know

558
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:02,400
it's inevitable even though it's been for what now four years we haven't raised it but it's like you

559
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,280
know it's coming when are they when they are number one they're gonna start doing all these

560
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:13,040
exclusive deals like that you know xbox has history and all i can do is make decisions that

561
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,880
are in front of us and try to be explicit about what our goals are so it sounds like that they're

562
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,840
trying to at least be pretty transparent with it um that they don't have plans to raise the price

563
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:27,520
of games pass and i'm sure when they do that they will let everybody know yeah they'll raise it

564
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,880
eventually don't kid yourself or i mean they'll they'll absolutely raise it eventually i what i

565
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,240
hope does doesn't happen is i don't want to see them go into tears that would be really crappy

566
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,240
um so i really hope microsoft doesn't go that direction but um because then then you end up in

567
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:48,080
the nintendo problem the lowest tier gets hardly any love i mean i guess hooray we got earthbound

568
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:53,760
um but you know what what other bones are they going to throw at it over the next year um so

569
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,760
yeah i don't want to see microsoft tear it i think we should all prepare for the price to

570
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:05,760
go up and let's also be real if you are a smart shopper trademark patent pending um you'll never

571
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,560
pay full price for game pass and i've talked about it here on the show is that obviously you know i'm

572
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:16,000
sure you all follow those gaming deals whether it be you know the cheap ass gamer wario 64 all those

573
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,720
types of put that when those cards go on sale and they will go on sale and i'm sure there are plenty

574
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:28,960
of you show of hands how many of you on black friday or around that time will stock the fuck up

575
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,520
on uh your cards for you know playstation microsoft and so forth for the next year

576
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:41,920
i'm sure there's people that do that for sure um uh and uh i've also talked about that i use the

577
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,280
microsoft rewards app uh now and i i understand why people might be adverse to using that because

578
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,520
essentially you're allowing you know extra data to go to microsoft and all this stuff and you

579
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:58,480
actually have to use bing which some people might fear um but i use it casually and i would say

580
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,720
one out of every three months i get comped through microsoft rewards you end up getting 12 000 points

581
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,360
and get a free month and so you know i i hope they would keep things like that into place if

582
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:15,440
nothing else you could probably get a discount so you know again if you're if you're a choosy choosy

583
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:22,400
shopper you'll never pay full price for these things so uh pod culture and chat says i loaded

584
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:29,120
up on black friday yep uh mike def says maybe uh sj100 matt saying i'm glad i have game pass

585
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:35,040
locked in for the next two years that xbox live gold trick oh that's probably also keeping them

586
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,920
from raising the price these people that are still locked in that won't have to pay it i wonder if

587
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,800
they're gonna wait another two years for everybody to be out of that that would be very interesting

588
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,440
uh fifth dream points out i think i have playstation network for three more years

589
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,480
so again kind of loading up uh maybe when it was cheap and you know what how how far out can you

590
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:01,680
load up xbox live like three years or something like that i mean if we think it's coming maybe

591
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,400
load up your account the next time these things go on sale something something to think about

592
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,440
but i also know that's a big you know that's a big uh cost and not maybe everybody's super into

593
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,600
game pass i don't know but uh i think it's great i love that they're building the cloud stuff into

594
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:24,320
it too so uh i plan to stick with it for a little while so all right uh did your mom says you can

595
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:30,640
load up to five years if i recall correctly uh as shown her matt says three years uh i wonder if you

596
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:36,080
know we might be talking about conversion uh that whole thing versus how much you can actually load

597
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,920
up i don't know i'd have i have to look into it i'm not sure the answer but it would be at least

598
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,880
i'm sure it's at least two three years that you can load in advance um something to think about

599
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:51,280
if you're that worried about the price going up um anyhow let's talk about a new playstation 5

600
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,200
update that's coming out uh since we've been talking a lot about microsoft let's show a little

601
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:01,440
love to sony after all isn't uh i think horizon forbidden west is this week isn't it that's uh

602
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,040
that's a big deal for sony so i'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be on that this

603
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:11,920
week um so uh anyway there will be a new system update for place actually sorry i i my mind

604
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,760
derailed again but i wanted to say i heard the speaking of horizon forbidden west i heard it is

605
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:25,360
two discs on playstation 4 you don't hear that one very often what year is this well it's because

606
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:35,760
it's a 90 gig install so uh laughs in call of duty updates yeah well yeah it's a lot but i'm

607
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:41,120
i mean there's two ways to look at it there's one going uh it's gonna eat so much of my space but

608
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:46,720
then you also go that means it's a fucking big game well also like if it's a 90 gig install at

609
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,240
least they have it on disk and they're not like saying hey you can download that first or you can

610
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,480
you know download that first 10 from the disc but you gotta download the rest from the cloud

611
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:03,040
good luck yeah i am so excited y'all my new internet that i'm gonna have as of saturday

612
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:10,000
no limit no limit yay i i can reconnect my xbox to automatic updates again i'm so excited

613
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,480
download all of the updates update all you want i cannot wait to download the shit out of everything

614
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,520
i can finally run my steam updates that i've been backlogged for like years it's fucking exciting

615
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:27,520
y'all all right anyway yeah or as to 100 matt making the classic bemoni reference going no

616
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:36,480
no limit no no no limit all right um anyway uh as 200 matt also used google fu to find out 36

617
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,040
months is the max you can load up uh xbox live but interesting mike def says it depends on the

618
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:46,720
region because mexico is only two and a half years oh that is interesting it could be by region too

619
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,360
all right sorry we derailed i wanted to talk about this new update for playstation 4 and playstation

620
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,160
that is going to be adding new accessibility and quality of life features including voice commands

621
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,800
uh right now a beta is going to be made available to english-speaking users in the u.s and uk

622
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:08,000
that will let you say hey playstation and sorry if i woke yours up but i don't think this beta

623
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,640
is actually out yet but it will be soon you can turn this feature off just like all the other

624
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:17,920
home assistants if you want and then you can use your voice to launch games whatever apps

625
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:24,400
open the system menu control media playback and so on and so on i have to say i i never saw myself

626
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,920
really using a lot of the voice commands but i have found it awfully convenient for the bedroom

627
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:38,720
tv which has a google chrome cast on it to say hey you know the word smart assistant um uh turn

628
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:44,720
on my television and launch twitch and it's nice to just have it all come up there while i'm you

629
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,280
know you know brushing my teeth and other stuff and then i can crawl into bed and watch twitch

630
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,720
before uh i drift off so it's just kind of kind of neat uh so they're building the same thing into

631
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,720
playstation why not there's a lot of media and stuff on playstation and if you want to launch

632
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:05,360
games that way sure why not also group chats will now be known as parties and you can decide if you

633
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:11,120
want them to be private or public parties so there's that uh if you leave a party public and

634
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:16,080
open your friends can join their friends can join so it definitely will be a party

635
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:21,600
also you'll now be able to filter games by genre and have five of them on the console's home screen

636
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:27,200
for quick access apparently trophy cards are going to be redesigned on ps5 and there will be more

637
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:32,080
screen reader languages which is great for accessibility and some other changes as well

638
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:38,240
you can opt into the beta test if you want over at playstation.com but get on that uh

639
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,720
wednesday is when they're gonna uh send out the emails on if you got in or not but that's pretty

640
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:49,200
exciting so uh let's see fifth dream in chat says that was always a good idea but usually muscle

641
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:55,440
memory and clicking buttons to launch games and whatever it's just quicker yes and no i do agree

642
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,880
with you but sometimes they change the interface uh and playstation is done at least on playstation

643
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,040
four because like you have to launch everything through the tv and video app when it comes to

644
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,720
stuff like twitch and stuff like things move around so it is and then like it it starts it's

645
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:16,560
not as fast as it used to be so like i have to launch it and wait for the icons to show up so

646
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:21,040
i can see where twitch is today or if it got rearranged or whatever at least that's been my

647
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:29,120
experience i just it's just easier to tell my uh you know a home assistant by uh g o o g l e to

648
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,520
sorry i'm really trying to not launch all of your assistants i have to remember that in this day

649
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:40,240
and age you you could call it uh call it gurgle yeah sure sure so i can say gurgle uh do this

650
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,280
thing and uh yeah it's just easier i think you just you you adapt the muscle memory i guess

651
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:54,640
all right uh up next oh it's this headline again we always like to hear this person in the news

652
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:04,480
because it makes for a funny headline right dark sagra yeah so um bowser has a 40 month stint to

653
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:10,000
do in prison yeah but not the bowser you're thinking uh unless you are thinking of the

654
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:17,040
hacker gary bowser so um he was the the person that had the switch hacking group team uh

655
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:26,000
executor um and so uh of course he's not doug bowser just saying even though they got their

656
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,920
names mixed up in the original version of the article oops um but he was part of a collective

657
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,640
that uh sold devices that you could use to pay to play pirated games on your switch um

658
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:45,520
they the fbi arrested him in 2020 and he agreed to pay 10 million to nintendo

659
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,640
for a civil privacy lawsuit and then another 4.5 million for restitution

660
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:58,000
but the sentencing today um not today but when they were doing the sentencing uh he was facing

661
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,320
up to 10 years in prison um and also because video game publishers apparently have lost more

662
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:12,880
than 65 million thanks to what team uh executor did they were wanting to to go for that instead

663
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:19,520
he is getting he got 40 months so that's still you know a big chunk out of his life and they're

664
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:27,680
still looking to find um his accomplices so that's really about all we know now but but yeah he's

665
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:34,800
being sentenced assisted well in 40 months maybe is when they'll release super mario odyssey 2

666
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:40,400
because bowser will get out of prison and kidnap the princess yet again uh dart tetsuya in chat

667
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,960
says i know everyone is taking up pitchforks against nintendo but i heard this guy had

668
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,840
malicious code in his mods i don't know if i can feel too sorry if that's the case um i don't know

669
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:53,360
if i'd believe everything i read on the internet but at the same time i also don't understand the

670
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,560
pitchforks against nintendo for this i mean this guy was pretty cocky from what i understand like

671
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:03,360
nintendo had slapped this guy down a couple times before and he was kind of continuing his stuff

672
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,200
thinking he was invincible so it kind of sounds like he got what was coming to him like exactly

673
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:15,760
and and the thing is it's one thing that if they're you know giving something away for for

674
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:23,120
free you know right but the fact that he was making money off of someone else's work pretty

675
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:30,880
much you know or as a uh an exploit to get around somebody else's work i mean it's i and now you

676
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:37,440
know i'll be honest i had like you know an r4 back in the day and and all of those but at the

677
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:44,560
end you know those for active systems those are things that are that are taking you know money

678
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:50,160
from the developers from from the people who are making the games and at this like if it was you

679
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:55,840
know say oh we've put out this you know the everdrive you know for a snus that's one thing

680
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:03,280
it's an old system they're not really making any money on you know obscure you know import games

681
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,920
unless they're going to put them out you know on the e-shop or something right so that's one thing

682
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:15,520
but for a modern active consistently updated and having released games for system that's many

683
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:22,720
hyphens in that phrase by the way um it makes perfect sense um and then to go around and be

684
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:28,080
oh i can't do shit to me and me and i'm like no do shit to him please yeah do lots of shit to him

685
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:33,840
and don't get me wrong i'm all for you know homebrew on consoles and you know unlocks to

686
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:38,320
do that and i realize it can be a slippery slope with piracy and i don't think we should be

687
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,960
pirating games i think we should you know support where we can the developers of worth but i'm all

688
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:48,400
for homebrew and things that open that up but when you're being very flagrant that you're doing it

689
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:54,400
for piracy which i kind of get the sense this guy was then it's kind of one of those why are we all

690
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:01,040
acting shocked that nintendo did this i i don't think you know we we nintendo is known for very

691
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:05,920
being very um aggressive to protect its shit but usually they're not going to try to send you to

692
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,880
jail they might shut you down like that youtuber um a few weeks ago but they're not gonna they're

693
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,320
not gonna go after that person to jail because they weren't like trying to flagrantly make money

694
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:22,000
off nintendo and pirate games and things of that sort and i think that's where uh this you know bad

695
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,320
bowser went wrong to be honest only sonic and chat says yeah modded my we too just a few years ago

696
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:33,440
yeah i modded mine and i'll also say it's the one time i did advocate for piracy because i did it to

697
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:41,600
play a game that nintendo refused to release here um and the sing star abba it uh i did end up doing

698
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:47,600
that but it was the xena i remember that's when tiara was visiting we came over it was xena blade

699
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,240
did it and then they ended up doing the game stop exclusive agreement which i still thought was shit

700
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:57,760
so i think in those circumstances i think it's a little more justified um but i mean like again if

701
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:03,440
i can walk into a target or other similar store you know and pick up the item off the shelf i

702
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:09,280
you know i'm probably gonna i'm 99.9 times out of 100 that's what i'll do but in those extreme cases

703
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:13,280
where you know what there's a game i want to play and the company refuses to release it in the us

704
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:17,040
i don't feel bad about piracy whatsoever in fact i would encourage people to pirate mother 3

705
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:29,440
oh um i i have a cartridge yeah i have a translated cartridge so but i will say to

706
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:36,720
companies credit even past where we were at with the nintendo we so many years ago i feel like

707
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:42,480
companies are finally realizing we live in a global sort of environment and we see more stuff

708
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:47,520
get released here um i think taiko no tatsujin is a great example we're seeing a lot of those

709
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,840
games ending up releasing here when you know uh we all remember a time when those were very uh

710
01:09:53,840 --> 01:10:00,000
nuanced you know japanese releases only that never saw the light of day over here and now we're

711
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,520
seeing them because i think these companies realize oh yes we live in a global economy

712
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:10,960
economy so uh mike deaf says sing star abba was ps3 there was a comparable one on the wii um there

713
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,480
was it was a it was just dance maybe or what yeah it was just dance there was a comparable abba game

714
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:21,600
on wii so yeah i think it was no it wasn't just dance it was like let's dance abba or something

715
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:29,840
like oh yeah it's even worse knock off something oh like we sing abba yeah yeah we sing abba uh

716
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:34,240
orange right says i would have never guessed taiko would be a worldwide release game that

717
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:39,440
would get announced on nintendo directs back in the 2000s exactly so things are getting better

718
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:44,800
in that regard so that's why you don't hear me like you know this show has been on for 20 years

719
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,760
so you could probably go back and find rob roberts advocating piracy in certain scenarios

720
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:56,960
but these days the the reasons to do it are not you know the games are available for you to pay

721
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,440
for them and pay the developers for their work and i think that's what you should do in the case of

722
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:08,320
mother 3 that is not an option for us so steal away in this case it's a political protest you

723
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:14,560
know yeah in a way yeah you are protesting the fact that this game has a high demand in the us

724
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,560
and they aren't releasing it so we're taking matters into our own hands at the end of story

725
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:24,560
i will be happy to pay for it once it's made available to me indeed same absolute same all

726
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,920
right uh yeah as 200 matt says i mean we all modded our playstation ones to play ddr titles

727
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:36,480
well i would argue that konami konami is or you use the plug right but i would argue that konami

728
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,880
is one of the worst offenders and this is why i think that it's actually you bring that up

729
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:47,280
i think that's very relevant to the history of our show let's really send off studio n7 tonight

730
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:53,120
and take a look back at the 20-year history of the show in the early years of the show the only

731
01:11:53,120 --> 01:12:01,840
way we could play ddr was to either pay excruciatingly high import fees for games or to mod

732
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:08,960
or to steal them essentially and i'm i'm sorry not sorry we stole them because that was the

733
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:14,320
only reasonable way to play them but you know what every time they released a mix here even if

734
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:21,680
it was subpar when ddr the original one came out on playstation the us version bought it konamiks

735
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:26,400
which i think turned like 22 years old this week i saw a tweet or something like that konamiks when

736
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:31,600
that came out bought it and all the other stuff bought those as well so um you know i would

737
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:37,040
support it when it finally would show up here uh and as joe and her map points out i remember it

738
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:43,680
was a big deal when the ds was region free yeah orange right says i even bought beatmania us

739
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:50,400
hey that control same but the controller was better remember uh yeah i well how many times

740
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:57,360
did we shave our 2dx japanese controller buttons and they think that you know mine actually had

741
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:04,400
the little pad mods underneath them um but then they constructed the new ones i think with

742
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,280
there's something very similar to those mods i heard there were some japanese players that

743
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:15,280
imported our version for that reason to get that controller yeah yep i i have a couple of friends

744
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:20,880
actually who were like hey can you send me a controller and i'd be like uh i'll see where i

745
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,800
can find them if i find oh well we just had someone so important for us sorry about it like

746
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:31,120
okay well i didn't buy it so fine i just i still have mine uh they just turned up in the garage

747
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:38,640
uh our old controllers for that so i have honey i actually need to find my copy of para para because

748
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:44,080
i have my biscuits and i don't have a game oh so and i wanted to bust it out and play it the other

749
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:52,320
day i actually was planning on hooking up uh uh 2dx uh fourth style so i could get no what no

750
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:58,000
was third style that had the right version of the safari oh yeah the slower one yeah the right

751
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,920
version of the safari not the crappy speedy one all right anyway let's move on too far down memory

752
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:10,880
lane but good times uh let's move on loki yeah so you know we've talked about how battlefield 2042

753
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:17,600
is kind of bad and because of that there is a change.org petition asking electronic arts to

754
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:24,880
offer refunds on all platforms for their players and they already have more than 150,000 people

755
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:32,880
that has signed that petition because it is pretty bad and they're losing players every day so

756
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:39,920
we'll see if that ends up happening the thing to note though is even though they have 150,000

757
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,400
signatures other campaigns have gotten a lot more signatures like for example making shaggy dlc in

758
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:58,720
moral combat 11 381 000 signatures so we'll see uh what pardon my ignorance on this but we all

759
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:05,440
know i don't usually play these type of games so what's wrong with the game loki can you translate

760
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:12,080
to gay for me yes i will translate so it is a very rushed and buggy put together game

761
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,360
for example some of the complaints that they have in there there's balancing issues with the

762
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,680
vehicles in the game hovercrafts are like way too op you can drive up the side of buildings with

763
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:28,160
those you can constantly respawn them um they may go from mass effect the very basics like a gun

764
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:33,680
play are just broken like you can literally empty a full clip into somebody and it doesn't register

765
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:41,200
a hit against them like just ridiculously stupid things like that so it's just it's very much broken

766
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:49,120
all right thank you for translating it sounds sounds like a hot mess it is a hot mess all right

767
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:58,640
um also a hot mess uh countries that don't support uh equal rights uh for all lgbtq people and we're

768
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:04,800
seeing that play out with a sims 4 wedding expansion and uh this expansion is not going

769
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:10,640
to release in russia because of federal laws over there that will not allow it to release

770
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:17,600
uh there was a law passed in 2013 uh that uh some folks uh outside of uh russia sometimes

771
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:24,480
call it the russia gay propaganda law um so basically uh maxis in a blog post called our

772
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:29,520
commitment to you a letter to our players from the sims team mentions that because there is a

773
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:35,280
wedding themed storyline involving a same-sex marriage between two characters uh it's a quote

774
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,720
not something we could freely share around the world and so the team wanted to quote explain the

775
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:46,000
decision that we've made not to release this pack in russia and it basically came down to the fact

776
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,960
that the team could either tell this story or uh they could uh and avoid the russia market or they

777
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:59,280
could change the content to meet those sorts of federal laws and they've decided to say uh we'll

778
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:04,480
just choose not to release it there at all um so this would be and i know we have listeners over

779
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:09,120
there so this would be a great this is one of those great opportunities where uh you could just

780
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:15,200
pirate it and play it anyway uh because not but i mean in this case it sucks because we should

781
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:20,800
support the developers but also it's funny because dark sakura talked about sometimes piracy being a

782
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:28,080
political protest and i feel in this particular case it really is right so very interesting so

783
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:34,080
but hey props to maxis first because you know other companies would have just said okay we'll

784
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:40,480
change the gender of the character um which they could have easily done um but they didn't do it

785
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,920
so that's great uh dart to see it says uh i remember that being a whole thing back around

786
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:52,240
the time of the winter olympics back then yeah so all right let's let's go back to

787
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:58,080
a simpler time shall we and uh revisit uh this segment that we love to do on our show

788
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:14,560
and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull

789
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,520
out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week

790
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:26,480
and what did you pick for us this week dark sakura jockey crush as they say in the intro

791
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:34,960
of it jockey crush it is well you remember xtifer playing all the alien crush he could possibly play

792
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,040
yeah he he really loved your guys's old place yeah that was on we virtual console yeah

793
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:49,360
um well jockey crush is the third in that whole series so of course the uh the first one being

794
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:55,120
alien crush and then devil's crush well actually dragon's revenge is also i guess would sort of be

795
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:02,080
the third one that came out that was the the uh genesis one that wasn't as great as the others

796
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:10,000
but jockey crush is continuing with that sort of uh otherworldly theme in the fact that it's an

797
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:18,240
ogre themed uh jockey is a type of a japanese demon um but it's another pinball game virtual

798
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:22,160
pinball game this one came out on the super famicon it never came out in the us um and it's

799
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:29,200
an it's an excellent game if you like you know virtual pinball uh one of the the great things

800
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:34,320
about this one is that it has a lot more in common with devil's crush uh in the fact that

801
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:42,640
it has these uh six hidden stages um and you also have alternating two player play um different

802
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:47,600
options where you can have different control control configurations your ball physics things

803
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:54,080
like that you know different speed settings um you also have um you know different tiers like

804
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,840
i was saying in the in uh in your levels the third level has like moving targets and uh

805
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,440
different lanes that lead you back to the second level you know all kinds of ways that you can get

806
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:12,000
around through there um it's it's really a very beautiful game as well um it is a little on the

807
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:20,240
dark side but dark and vivid if if that makes sense um and in in fact it's actually even

808
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:27,040
considered you know an equal to any of the others in the series you know even slightly crisper in

809
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:38,400
terms of its uh its uh design and color scheme but uh jackie crush uh came out in 1992 uh again for

810
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:47,600
the super famicom put up by an access soft um and it's again in the whole crush series um it also

811
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,600
you know i'd have to say that

812
01:20:51,840 --> 01:21:00,880
if you've got a way to play this game and you have not i would actually do it yeah this is

813
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,520
actually the official third game because that uh that genesis one that came out i don't really

814
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,040
think it was actually part of the part of the series like an official part of the series more

815
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:18,240
like a spiritual successor type game but um i i also you know it's got a like story to it

816
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:26,240
and everything about like you know the magical pinball from hell or something um and the the

817
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:32,160
sad thing about it is that while there are a lot of enthusiasts who do recall alien crush and

818
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:36,480
devil's crush um they don't know about jackie crush because it didn't come out over here i

819
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:40,000
know i've mentioned it on the show before fifth stream was talking about demon's tilt and demon's

820
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,520
tilt is an absolute spiritual successor to the series i i've actually streamed a decent bit of

821
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:54,480
this game as well um i jackie crush in fact i i might actually just bust this out later this week

822
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:01,120
and show it off um maybe on my wednesday night stream but it's really worth playing um of course

823
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:06,080
also developed by compile and compile has given us one of the other best games in the universe

824
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:11,520
the guardian legend so and on top of that too the music is really good

825
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:20,880
yeah i noticed the music in this is great oh yeah the music in this game it just really sets

826
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:27,600
the entire tone for it and on top of that you know there's uh gosh it's like this one

827
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:34,240
uh stage on the table where it's sort of like this sort of purple rocky

828
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:41,600
side and it's got this uh the jackie in the center of it you know in red and white and it almost

829
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:47,040
makes me think that it's like in this sort of abyss where everything else just has that sort

830
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:53,680
of red outlined and and it honestly feels like there's some true depth in the game even though

831
01:22:53,680 --> 01:23:02,320
it's two-dimensional so i i have absolutely been enamored with this game um i wouldn't mind owning

832
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:08,560
an original of it and i've played it you know uh quite a few times i really enjoy it but i

833
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:14,960
just think that there's like a sort of crispness to this one that is missing from quite a few other

834
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:22,080
uh uh pinball tables and in fact uh the one on stream right now is always the mode that i called

835
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:28,880
uh space invader mode sort of um but i think that there are so many different variances in

836
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:37,200
in gameplay between the multiple stages that you have enough to keep you interested in it it's got

837
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:44,320
a good enough challenge to it that the replayability is absolutely there um okay

838
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,400
sorry to the podcast listeners but this mode that we're looking at on twitch right now this creepy

839
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:56,800
as fuck yeah it has sort of like this uh almost like kind of reminds me of miss nude world

840
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:07,120
the face in the background is sort of like almost like a type of no mask i think um but uh you also

841
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:11,280
have like these little spheres that are coming coming out almost like little uh scarabs what it

842
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:17,440
looks like and then uh you you're sort of arcanoid style except you've got your your paddles and so

843
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:23,440
you're shooting the little uh demon ball around and trying to destroy them all and then you have

844
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:29,840
to the eyes on the background start blinking in red and you have to shoot the ball into one of

845
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:37,680
those eyeballs and as you go through it the face changes more and more to the style of a hanya mask

846
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:44,560
if you don't know what that is go look it up um where it gets more and more demonic as you know

847
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:48,160
well i'd say more like you know traditional ogre style masks like

848
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:56,320
like i said like a hanya and it's really well detailed and absolutely gorgeous the the shading

849
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:05,920
i mean it's for pixel art it's good artwork wouldn't you say yeah see and and and like in

850
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,080
the level it's on now like the face is getting more orange and it definitely looks a lot more

851
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:16,800
like the traditional hanya so i i absolutely love this game especially you know bringing in the

852
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:24,720
mythos of this particular one i i absolutely love it um so i will talk about um the others in the

853
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:29,280
series just a little bit because i think i have talked about alien crush before and devil's crush

854
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:35,120
i think i've done them both as a classic game um the other game that i mentioned is dragon's revenge

855
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:42,800
which is sort of like a genesis answer um it's not really as good the ball physics are

856
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:50,080
not great i mean it's it's it's an amusing play i'll put it that way but it isn't great but there

857
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:59,520
was a uh a we wear release uh updated version of alien crush called alien crush returns

858
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,960
and it was pretty neat i mean i'll probably talk about that as a classic game later

859
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:11,520
but you know this is just one in the series i mean every game that's in the official crush

860
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:16,080
series is absolutely worth playing and then if you want the modern take on it like we're saying

861
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:28,000
earlier um there is a uh a demon's tilt on steam it is also available uh on mac on steam absolutely

862
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:37,120
absolutely a good way to satisfy that uh that'll crush pinball uh craving if you get it

863
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:43,520
so that's what i'm gonna throw in there jackie crush if you get a chance to play it absolutely

864
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:47,360
do and if you do play it let me know because i wouldn't know what you think of it it's one of

865
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:54,320
one of my favorite uh virtual pinball games great there it is your classic game of the week uh jackie

866
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:59,600
crush uh and i gotta say you know i'm kind of with the chat like i knew of course about aliens

867
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,800
crush and devil's crush like those are very hard games to miss especially if you followed the

868
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:08,160
terrific 16 at all um and i'm sure i think i feel like you've probably mentioned this in passing

869
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:13,760
because i just know you love this series um but i've not really sit down and watched it and listened

870
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,720
to it before and it's pretty cool like i wonder how this one kind of got lost i guess maybe maybe

871
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,480
it came out and later in the super nintendo's life or something i don't know it was 92.

872
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:27,440
oh yeah weird i just feel like it didn't come out in the u.s compared to the others

873
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,960
i mean if you think about it this way it's a pinball game number one which is a little bit

874
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:42,160
more obvious you know a genre for for a video game true and it didn't see the light of day outside of

875
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:46,400
japan back in you know those days it was much harder to get those imports and then of course

876
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:51,680
by the time importing became the big thing that it is like i didn't buy my first import game until

877
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:58,080
like 95 yeah i take that back 94 my first import game that i bought was uh the sailor moon s

878
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:07,840
fighting game um which actually now uh gwen has it i think i think i sold it to gwen um but uh

879
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:15,200
but going back to it i mean importing was like when i imported my sailor moon game i did it

880
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:27,040
by literal magazine mail order cod oh my god yeah so um it it's it was a different

881
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:32,080
is a different world than for for you know importing and we didn't have you know

882
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:38,320
emulators at least that were as sophisticated as this in fact i didn't think i actually even

883
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:49,040
had my first emulated game until maybe the late 90s late late 90s so i mean this game

884
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:56,480
came out when i was in 10th grade it was that long ago but it's i i mean i i know that i have

885
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:01,120
certain games that are like oh yeah play it it's fun and something i'm really like you gotta play

886
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:07,040
i say if you really if you like the the first two crash games you absolutely owe it to yourself to

887
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:12,240
play this one because this is an excellent game it's a wonderful addition to the series and i

888
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:17,520
honestly would love for them to put out like a crush compilation that has that kind of like the

889
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:22,640
monster boy treatment remember where you can switch back and forth between the old mode and

890
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:30,480
like a new updated mode um and i think that that that would sell i would buy i would buy it or

891
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:35,280
where you can play the switch vertically i always thought that was really cool for the um pinball

892
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:40,560
simulators that do that yeah well i mean the wonders the wondrous one the wondrous one color

893
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,320
back in the day was set to be played vertical horizontally because a couple of the clindola

894
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:49,440
games worked that way and you know they could easily do that with the switch but

895
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:57,680
when when all right opportunities all right there it is your classic game of the week great pick

896
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:02,560
very very educational for the folks tonight especially if you like pinball fan or if you

897
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:08,240
like pinball at all or like pinball inspired um games you know of which there's there's been a few

898
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:13,920
uh through the years you know uh even things like pinball quest or i think of like you know the

899
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:19,360
translations like uh pinbot and high speed that were so weird on the nes because they did shit

900
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:25,920
that you can't actually do physically uh and then music yeah which the originals really didn't have

901
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:32,080
anything like that i i i thought that someone did a rom hack of pinbot to turn it into jackpot i'd

902
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:38,320
have to take a look for that but the thing the thing with these that are like this in particular

903
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:44,080
and this is where my point is going on this is that these were made solely they're not a

904
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:50,800
translation they're not a recreation like you know pinmame or uh or pinball effects or something like

905
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:59,200
that these are virtual pinball that is meant to be played in that kind of environment it's built

906
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:07,680
for a console and so you get an experience on a table like that that you cannot get at all unless

907
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:15,840
you have like again one of those you know uh uh pinmame cabinets that has you know that a game

908
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,600
would be programmed for something like that the closest we even have to i mean that would work

909
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:25,520
something like that would work if you had where it would just move the the tables back and forth you

910
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,240
know on a virtual screen something like that would work but you also then miss feeling the

911
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:36,720
ball i guess and being able to control your tilts and whatnot but that's actually one thing i have

912
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:41,120
to go back and say about demon's tilt is that it actually does have a pretty decent tilt function

913
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:46,800
in it so um but i i could i could go on about this all day but that's the thing that makes these

914
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:53,200
games special is that they were programmed this way this is their intent and they're so unique

915
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:59,520
in that that it it's you can be a fan of pinball you could be a fan of puzzle games i'd put it that

916
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:06,800
way too and this game is definitely a test of your hand-eye coordination and it's challenging

917
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:11,440
in a way that conventional pinball isn't well i don't know if you'd want to play this table in

918
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,520
real life those those demon faces are scary as fuck i'd run out of the building screaming

919
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:21,280
i don't know i don't think they're that scary but maybe if it was like bleeding all over the place

920
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:28,320
and yeah maybe all right great pick let's get into some other news uh rapid fire style with

921
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:36,800
some rapid fire news loki to go to go along with the announcement and release of earthbound on

933
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:53,760
little blast in the past i remember there's yeah i mean it's just nice to have yeah so let's move

934
01:33:53,760 --> 01:34:01,680
on yeah so um well shakila neil and arcade one up is doing an nba jam shack edition arcade machine

935
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:08,320
so uh just in case we haven't had enough uh enough shack going on back in the day we have some new

936
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:16,000
shack um they are uh they had an announcement at shacks fun house which a concert experience in la

937
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:23,600
um this weekend um actually they made the announcement on friday but um he is uh gonna

938
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:30,000
be doing the uh he's actually uh gonna be playing the nba jam on that custom one up and so it will

939
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:38,400
be a 65.8 inches high uh which is taller than their existing nba jam with a 19-inch screen

940
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:45,040
wi-fi enabled and three playable games just nba jam nba jam tournament edition and nba hang time

941
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:53,200
and of course he was in the original nba jam with the orlando magic uh moving on uh cloud from final

942
01:34:53,200 --> 01:35:01,920
fantasy 7 will be available in chocobo grand prix in their first season pass uh and uh have a 800

943
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:08,960
mithril login bonus oh my gosh this model is so freaking cute um like how can you be an adorable

944
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:18,560
chibi and still look that constipated seriously um but anyway um he is a season pass exclusive

945
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,040
so if you were playing that go for it

946
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:30,400
i just don't like that i'm hearing about 800 mithril season pass and i'm like oh god how much

947
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:36,240
you know games as a service crap are they loading into this because i was really looking forward to

948
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:40,560
this but i'm not looking forward to all these microtransactions is it a free-to-play game

949
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:45,600
oh is it oh i didn't know i thought i just assumed it was a purchase game

950
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:52,080
if it's free to play i guess it's a little less annoying i like i like it's having options like

951
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:56,080
the free-to-play mmos but if you pay the subscription and you get a few bells and whistles

952
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:03,360
you know something like that is perfectly acceptable no all right um let us travel around

953
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:07,680
the world and check out some games that are coming out probably sooner than chocobo gp

954
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:13,200

01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:27,600
further with the show in our listener round table in a little bit uh but first loki it take to be

983
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:33,600
working on a new midnight club game some people like to think so because the developer visual

984
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:41,600
concepts who has worked on the nba 2k and wwe 2k series they are recruiting for an open world

985
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:46,080
driving game and immediately everyone thinks midnight club because you know rockstar has

986
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:53,120
that and stuff the work could be a new ip we don't know but there is a new driving game coming from

987
01:39:53,120 --> 01:40:02,240
take two so we'll just have to see what it is at some point will it be midnight club who knows

988
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:06,400
how would you feel about a new midnight club it's not rockstar working on it i'm kind of

989
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:14,800
disappointed with that but meh whatever it's been a long time yeah it's been a while so i i

990
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:19,600
want i don't want to see some video see it in motion see what it looks like all right yeah

991
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:27,200
definitely dark sakura so uh there is a series that i i would probably say a lot of uh people

992
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:34,480
who are into import games especially dating sims know very well um tokimeki memorial which is uh

993
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:42,160
konami's a big dating sim it was the big one that everyone knew about um so there is an independent

994
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:50,800
uh retro game translator known as retro translator that um has uh his team working uh has sorry their

995
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:56,800
their team working on translating uh one of the tokimeki memorial games into english and it's

996
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:05,760
almost complete but here is uh the thing it is not uh tokimeki memorial forever with me which

997
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,040
is like the playstation one the one that everybody likes it was the one that was like the best

998
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:16,480
improved of them it's the snes one or the super famicom one uh which is uh tokimeki memorial

999
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:23,680
which translates to heartthrob memorial under the tree of legends you know i actually have

1000
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:34,400
the tokimeki memorial oav on laserdisc um but it's it this is the big game i think that brought

1001
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:42,960
dating sims to the fore like i mean they were already kind of big in in japan um and the i'm

1002
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,440
sorry it's not forever with me it's forever with you um it was actually the upgraded version from

1003
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:55,440
the pc engine super cd rom one the turbo graphic cd the snes one came out after the playstation one

1004
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,480
and uh it didn't have any voice acting of course because it was this mess and it was just like

1005
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:10,080
really watered down um so this is this is this is a toki memo that is just really not the one

1006
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:15,200
that everyone wanted of course you know i think it would be easier to do a translate a translated

1007
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:25,600
copy of the the snus one which for the record several already exist just saying um i yeah

1008
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:34,400
um on top of that too you know some other people are like well why not do uh toki memo pocket you

1009
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:42,160
know the one of the uh uh you know a handheld one to bring with it but at the same time you know

1010
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:48,960
it is what it is for some people this is going to be the way that people start off with toki memo

1011
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:56,880
um i personally would uh would like to see a translation uh an official release of uh

1012
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:02,240
toki memo girl side where basically you play one of the female characters dating the boys

1013
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:09,600
you know which as i was i thought it was pretty cool that you know in all of the world of boy

1014
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:16,480
date girl you know dating sim thing they did in the toki memo series they did one where the girls

1015
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:24,160
can go after the boys um i mean now of course we have a slew of you know various different

1016
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:32,240
options for for dating sims including the very popular uh boyfriend dungeon and uh dream daddy

1017
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:40,240
and uh uh the colonel sanders game which i still need to play blink blink but i i think

1018
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:47,520
i'm glad i'm glad it's being done i'm not trying to to uh poopoo on the attempt it's just there's

1019
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:52,480
better toki memo games to do the playstation one would have been absolutely astounding to have

1020
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:57,840
just even the japanese voice acting is fine you know but have it translated into english you get

1021
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:06,240
an authentic experience but in dialogue that you know that a westerner can understand

1022
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:13,520
i'm sure also just i think you kind of addressed it just the tools kind of being easier and a

1023
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,600
little more accessible for the super nintendo probably made it the one that was just like

1024
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:22,800
the easier one to translate maybe so but hey making the game available for more people to

1025
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:28,960
try out but like you said i guess translations already exist so but well there there are a few

1026
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:36,800
other um fan translations that are coming out sort of a quote officially uh one of them is uh there

1027
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:43,840
was a japanese exclusive yakuza game that came out on psp um that's called uh yakuza black panther in

1028
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:55,440
english or uh i'm gonna mispronounce this uh um which yeah because a black panther um and then

1029
01:44:55,440 --> 01:45:04,880
uh another game called uh miser uh miserna falls so it's a ps1 game that where you can pet a dog

1030
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:10,400
apparently that's uh that's getting a fan translation too um i also thought it was very

1031
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:18,320
interesting that there's a fan translation out for uh the biohazard uh 1.5 almost a fully playable

1032
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:23,440
version so pretty cool what a lot of like you know modders and translators are doing to make

1033
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:27,680
more of these games playable by more people around the world pretty cool power of boredom and wanting

1034
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:32,400
to play a game yeah well meanwhile while these folks work on new technologies and new things

1035
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:36,640
that are great for games we have other big companies doing the exact opposite right loki

1036
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:45,680
yes it's your weekly disappointment in the game industry your depression if you will of

1037
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:53,840
the future that is coming the unwanted nft future that ubisoft is just running full speed ahead

1038
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:59,440
into a wall with um so apparently one of the things that ubisoft is doing is they're

1039
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:08,720
collaborating with the sandbox which is a game if you will um that's more of like a virtual space

1040
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:14,960
that you can buy real estate in and walk around with avatar it basically looks like playstation

1041
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:20,480
home if they monetize the crap out of it and made it blockchain made it stupid um so that's kind of

1042
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:26,240
what that is and of course ubisoft's like yep sign me up for that uh so they've brought the

1043
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:32,400
rabbits to it because everybody needs that um and then of course you know ubisoft employees

1044
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:39,120
are still telling um their you know higher ups that nft suck and that they really shouldn't be

1045
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:46,320
in that business um you know one of the there's some fun comments from the ubisoft employees like

1046
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:52,000
are we competing with ea for the most hated game studio by the public uh because this is how you do

1047
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:58,880
it i think the kids call this entire comment session um being ratioed um you know what else

1048
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:05,280
makes a lot of money uh making fun spectacular groundbreaking blockbusters why don't we focus

1049
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:10,720
on that instead you know what else is great in the company not sexually harassing your employees

1050
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:17,040
but hey you know ubisoft gonna ubisoft so what can you do they just just play by some different

1051
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:22,320
rules that's all you know if they could meant sexual harassment into the blockchain i'm sure

1052
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:27,840
they would try to do that as well uh uh as she 100 matt and chad says i love that ubisoft's

1053
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:33,680
internal employee forum was filled of employees dunking on the company's stance on nfts hey

1054
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:38,320
that's why and you know shout out to those frontline employees at ubisoft that are fighting

1055
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:42,800
the good fight on the inside because you know we've said this time and time again these stupid

1056
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:47,840
decisions are never the fault of the hard-working you know frontline creators of these games it's

1057
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:53,120
always some dumb fuck executive who shouldn't even be in this business uh who's making these calls and

1058
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:58,640
it's it's very apparently clear with what you see with what's going on at ubisoft and uh good on

1059
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:08,000
them for ray showing uh these these stupid things that people don't want um if yeah anyway um and

1060
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,520
then of course a little bit more details regarding the whole team 17 worms nft announcement thing

1061
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:18,640
that we kind of talked about i think last week um talking about how basically the employees

1062
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:25,200
had no idea that this was even happening aside from the higher ups um you know and the qa

1063
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:32,320
developers of course at team 17 are really not paid very well between 20 000 25 000 annually

1064
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:39,280
and while they're yeah and so while they're struggling to pay bills you know there is

1065
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:44,160
people that um they're going out there and trying to make a few extra bucks off of some

1066
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:54,080
of their assets from the company so obviously um that's not a good look so wow yeah all right

1067
01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:00,480
uh well uh let's hope these ubisoft executives i get put in their place real soon and stop driving

1068
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,360
the company in this direction or they're going to just drive them right out of business

1069
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:10,160
um for our last uh official story tonight i thought this was a fun one to go out on uh

1070
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:16,560
the fact that uh maim uh known as the multiple arcade machine emulator is what maim stands for

1071
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:24,480
uh just turned 25 years old uh believe it or not its debut was the feb February 5th of 1997

1072
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:29,280
if you've never heard of maim that's kind of surprising uh it's an emulator that runs all

1073
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:36,240
sorts of old um arcade emulation uh and a lot of a lot of stuff than throughout the years i remember

1074
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:41,040
i mean i'm dating myself obviously but whatever i remember being around when maim kind of first came

1075
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:46,400
out and it was a lot of the really old like namco boards and atari boards where they first started

1076
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:51,040
but then obviously you know maim started to get into you know newer and newer stuff when they

1077
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:56,640
started getting stuff like street fighter 2 and uh mortal combat and then you know even beyond that

1078
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:01,120
uh it really became its own thing and of course i wish that they could still do the hikaru

1079
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:06,720
software that would have been amazing uh of course maim does state on the official maim website their

1080
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:13,200
purpose is to preserve decades of software history uh and maim prevents important vintage software

1081
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:18,400
from being lost and forgotten uh achieved by documenting the hardware and how it functions

1082
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:23,440
the source code to maim serves as this documentation so um yeah again you know a lot

1083
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:28,320
of people might jump to oh these bad things you know maim leads to piracy and all that but

1084
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:33,040
you know again there's a lot of rights and a lot of things that get lost out there throughout the

1085
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:37,920
years also games are just not available i mean like where are you going to find like it it's

1086
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:42,720
like if you want a certain type i mean granted they have you know arcade went up for a lot of

1087
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:47,600
things but there's a lot of games that are very obscure out there that good luck finding hardware

1088
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:54,480
for that and some old creators from the 80s uh made public domain their roms basically who had

1089
01:50:54,480 --> 01:51:00,000
the right rights and license to do so and were like yeah maim's pretty cool and so you can uh

1090
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:05,200
distribute this however much you want so there are there are there is a set i don't know how

1091
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:10,560
many games are uh technically public domain but there's a set of you know at least 10 games

1092
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:15,200
probably more at this point it's been a while since i've looked that are absolutely free to

1093
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,960
get maim and use them and have fun with it and experience some old arcade games

1094
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:25,200
and then what also was interesting about this uh the 2021 release capcom arcade stadium which is

1095
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:32,560
relatively i have that on the switch apparently it was using code from maim in it so not a huge

1096
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:37,360
surprise i'm sure uh interesting how that's come full circle the surprise was they actually

1097
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:43,920
credited them which is nice yeah that is true yeah that is nice so but also apartment just being a

1098
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:49,920
nice gesture it also does sort of cover their tail legally right because i remember i feel

1099
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:56,640
like there was something that didn't do that and it became it was oh yeah yeah no i thought there

1100
01:51:56,640 --> 01:52:00,400
was something that's obs yes but i thought there was something involving maim too but yeah that

1101
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:07,200
was a kind of an adjacent issue for sure yeah it's the same thing you know if they had they

1102
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:11,680
weren't supposed to use obs in the name or they were supposed to credit or something and none of

1103
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:16,320
that happened uh dart to see is talking about the public domain games talking about robbie

1104
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:20,800
roto off the top of my head but there's a few others yeah i think that's the one um they

1105
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:27,680
released that uh on like the of the phone stores and uh that's the it was a full running copy of

1106
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:33,760
maim that they and you were able to load it basically on your um uh devices and play games

1107
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:38,640
that way that's how i have uh on my ipad my old ass ipad at this point uh a version of maim

1108
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:45,040
basically is uh from from that being available for like a week uh but orange right says maim

1109
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:51,280
preserves so many games that we would have never heard of absolutely uh dart says uh capcom arts

1110
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:56,160
arcade stadium has its issues but i do fire it up now and then for some classic arcade fun yeah

1111
01:52:56,160 --> 01:53:00,480
it's it's like everything else i've talked about when they do like legal versions especially when

1112
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:04,800
they you know enhance it a little bit which you know capcom arcade stadium has like the achievements

1113
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:09,120
the online leaderboards you know they they some different graphical ways of looking at it they

1114
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:13,840
tried to sweeten the pot a little bit i supported it because i like retro gaming it's fun and i like

1115
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:18,320
when the companies dip into their back catalogs i wish there would be another midway arcade treasures

1116
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:22,400
collections there's some really good stuff in there but um we haven't seen those releases in

1117
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:33,760
a very long time so holy crap hmm ivan reitman died oh gosh yeah i i i just saw the the posting

1118
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:40,720
about it from associated press it's like just now huh well i didn't mean to derail everything with

1119
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:50,800
it but uh but yeah wow no that's fine wow all right time to watch ghostbusters yeah gosh okay

1120

uh moving on let's get to our listener round table uh we invite your uh emails at participate

1121
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:06,160
orange lounge radio.com and i think i saw one come in uh we do have one so let's get to it let's get

1122
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:13,520
to our emails first so it's one email and you'll know who it is email singular and you'll know who

1123
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:22,240
it is the moment i start reading it you ready hello lr hi it's been a while but i've been

1124
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:27,360
listening to the podcast for just about this whole time congratulations rob to you and alan on the

1125
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:33,600
new place i'm looking forward to seeing the new studio smiley face rob you were right we you did

1126
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:38,720
in fact release in november of 2012 when it launched with a really really fun tech demo

1127
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:46,640
a 2d mario game and a bunch of third-party games that would most likely uh already played on other

1128
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:51,920
platforms i would argue that the unexciting launch lineup and the many long stretches between big

1129
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:57,280
game releases did as much to hurt the wii u as its awful name i kept defending that name you

1130
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:04,800
know that and i still kind of defend it um despite this i do still actively have mine hooked up

1131
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:12,080
primarily for don't laugh at me we fit you that now that name is funny i'm just saying no i i and

1132
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:16,240
i wouldn't laugh at that either i mean it was a great fitness title right yeah i know i know a

1133
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:21,600
lot of people have kind of graduated for lack of a better term to ring fit but i also know it's a

1134
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:27,040
different like ring fit and we fit you are are very different games so um no i don't i don't

1135
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:32,880
fault you i'm not gonna laugh at you for keeping that hooked up and i um and i have a hard time

1136
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:39,680
believing that switch sports will top we sports club but i guess we'll see soon enough i was

1137
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:44,240
delighted that wolfenstein 3d was mentioned during the classic game of the week segment recently

1138
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:48,960
i was also happy to hear that both the mac version and the modding community were mentioned you

1139
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:53,680
probably already know this if you watched my yyr game's 10th anniversary retrospective videos but

1140
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:59,920
only a handful of people did so i'll tell you that i was a member of wolf addict software the largest

1141
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:06,720
modding group for the mac version during the mid to late 90s 1990s we actually sold several scenarios

1142
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:11,280
created by our members including new levels graphics audio and more because the mac version

1143
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:16,720
of wolf 3d came out later it featured higher resolution graphics and an engine capable

1144
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:22,560
of more things than the original it was super fun to be a part of this but what's really surprising

1145
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:27,920
is that there is currently an ongoing effort to bring the mac wolfenstein 3d mods back to modern

1146
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:34,160
systems it's called mac and wolf and i highly recommend that you google it if you are interested

1147
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:41,200
in checking out some vintage classic gameplay that's m a c e n wolf have fun everyone i'll end

1148
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:47,120
on this note i am normally an optimist so um and i would normally never cast doubt on something

1149
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:52,800
i truly love but i am sorry to say that unless olr moves to a more frequent broadcast schedule

1150
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:59,520
it will never reach episode 9000 with its current hosts well that is unless you're good to go for

1151
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:06,880
another 156 years or more if you miss more than a few weeks um i'm sorry to have to deliver the

1152
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:12,320
bad news but honestly thank you for another week of this show that we all enjoy so much and enjoy

1153
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:18,560
your week off looking forward to whatever is next erin yyr well you know we can number these

1154
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:23,440
episodes however the fuck we want to so when we numbering is arbitrary when we want to do episode

1155
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:28,880
9000 we will well you know and and you know um there's another podcast out there um gamertag

1156
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:35,840
radio who crossed a thousand episodes even though um they started two three years after we did sorry

1157
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:39,600
i don't know the exact day is not i'm certainly not here to shade anybody there's a lot of work

1158
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:44,880
that went into that um danny and the crew over there work very hard on what they do um but they

1159
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:50,560
also put out multiple episodes a week and i think during e3 a lot of episodes like usually like

1160
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:55,040
historically so um they were kind of able to and so a lot of people assume that that is the longest

1161
01:57:55,040 --> 01:58:02,240
running show because they have more episodes um we could have there was a time when i was uh

1162
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:06,080
clipping up some of you may remember this some of you longtime listeners where i was clipping up

1163
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:11,680
olr and i was putting out the first half on the feed on like monday and the second half on like

1164
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:17,600
wednesday to try to kind of fill the week but the big feedback i got after about a year was like

1165
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:21,920
stop doing that we just want to listen to it all in one you know go and i did kind of go like why

1166
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:26,960
am i doing that but it's funny because you know maybe if i counted those as separate episodes

1167
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:30,960
we would have hit a thousand by now but i'm not out to yuck somebody's yum like it's just you know

1168
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:36,240
it is what it is we've done a we've done a weekly thing and and uh pissing in the cornflakes exactly

1169
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:45,280
exactly so um but uh if but i guess my point is aaron if you do want us to hit uh 9 000 episodes

1170
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:49,920
i guess i could start uh chopping up the show into five minute chunks and releasing those all

1171
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:54,880
as separate episodes but i'm not sure what the podcast folks would think about that so uh pod

1172
01:58:54,880 --> 01:59:00,640
culture says there was also olr to go the interesting thing about that is that um before

1173
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:09,040
the shows merged so our live show in the podcast merged around episode 180 i want to say question

1174
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:14,160
mark it's probably on the wiki somewhere so yeah technically there were 50 episodes or so of the

1175
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:21,200
show that weren't like counted accounted for somewhere else but i think there would be other

1176
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:25,840
people that would argue well the shows that weren't actually a podcast that we did on live

1177
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:31,120
365 shouldn't be counted and i i beg to differ because they exist and we've been doing them but

1178
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:37,200
again it's just it's it's arbitrary just like dark soccer said it's all in what you choose to

1179
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:43,040
do and how you want to do it so uh as 200 matt says each story is an episode you'll hit 9000

1180
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:50,080
no problem uh and yes dark to see absolutely he just wants the chance to make the over 9000 joke

1181
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:55,600
absolutely um you know what one of these days over 9000 words spoken that's right

1182
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:07,120
so where are we on that uh uh the guinness thing i already they they sent it back remember oh

1183
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:12,720
because we have to do it as a as a company i didn't resubmit because i we need to have uh the

1184
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:20,320
like some sort of company way to do it i think we could probably submit it under vog network but i

1185
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:24,400
think there'd be a charge with that so we'd have to figure that out there's there's still going to

1186
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:29,120
be a free when the charge comes if you want the accelerated application oh okay um maybe we can

1187
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:35,200
do that then i'm i've got to dig into it but i've had real life stuff going on too so it might my

1188
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:39,840
health issues have taken priority because i'm still dealing with that whole uh narcolepsy

1189
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:47,760
diagnosis crap all right uh yeah pod culture i remember that we'd record pod culture in a chunk

1190
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:52,800
and i'd chop it up yeah and it just you know it just is all depends on how you want to do it no

1191
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:59,120
no biggie all right um let's see uh let me i didn't check discord to see if we had any callers over

1192
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:03,680
there if you want to give us a call you can just head on over to vog network.com discord and join

1193
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:08,720
our green room uh nobody's there now and i know we just we just have a smaller turnout live tonight

1194
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:12,960
because of things that are going on on television even though my understanding is it's over now

1195
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,640
but i'm sure folks are still with their you know friends family and people they hang out with on

1196
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:21,200
days like today so it's probably just going to be more of a podcast heavy week and that's okay too

1197
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:26,000
we love our podcast audience feel free to say hi to us either on social media like twitter's

1198
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,280
a great place to say hi at olr uh and of course the email bag as well like aaron did this week

1199
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:36,960
participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us an email uh let me check in

1200
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:42,480
with loki and see if there's any last minute stories yes there is one so there's a game coming

1201
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:50,320
out called martha is dead um it's coming out on pc playstation and saw this on discord yeah

1202
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:56,720
so on the playstation version they're actually censoring the game uh because there's a very

1203
02:01:56,720 --> 02:02:02,320
sensitive scene that's being depicted in the game um spoilers they cut off someone's face and then

1204
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:08,480
put it on um so that apparently is not going to be on the playstation five and playstation

1205
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:16,560
four versions um but the other versions will be just fine this game sounds like a bit much for me

1206
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:22,320
yeah it sounds like that said though like they had really violent stuff though in like last of

1207
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:27,520
us two and stuff so like did they cut off someone's face i don't know i didn't play last

1208
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:30,960
wasn't there also something about like the sister

1209
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:36,960
it's there was something like really weird sounding and i was just like this game isn't

1210
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:42,320
for me that's all i was i read it i was like this game isn't for me um sj100 matt in chat says people

1211
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:49,600
are so mad about this well then don't buy it on playstation yeah it's like it's pretty simple um

1212
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:57,760
sia tabirian chat says it's not as if they were renaming at martha's badly maimed uh fifth dream

1213
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:04,160
says oh it's your sister's face that's gross what a weird game but what i hey y'all are into whatever

1214
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:09,760
you're into enjoy your horror porn if that's your thing i will be watching over here off once

1215
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:16,800
already so it's it's all good i think that was a little different all right uh if there's no other

1216
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:20,720
last minute stories then i think we will move to close up shop tonight i know it's a little

1217
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:27,040
bit earlier we still broke two hours but um it is what it is so uh let's go around and wrap things

1218
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:31,280

1236
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:12,800
in the streaming yes you should yes you should all right uh and for my final thought tonight i

1237
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:17,520
guess i'll i'll change the shot here and you may see some unsightly things in the shot oh no it's

1238
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:24,720
still pretty in pretty decent shape here but uh there it is uh the studio and uh the last hurrah

1239
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:30,240
from this particular studio that served us well um over these last few years about seven years

1240
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:35,440
uh thank you all for being a part of it whether uh you've been here on twitch uh as we made the

1241
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:40,880
transition to go to video on twitch or whether you were here through the uh um uh shoutcast

1242
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:44,960
years as well because this place was really only set up to do audio uh but we've seen all the

1243
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:50,160
changes and so forth as well so a big farewell to studio and seven i am really looking forward

1244
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:56,160
to the future though i appreciate everyone's support as we get there uh i know uh some people

1245
02:05:56,160 --> 02:06:00,560
really want us to all be back in person uh it's just one of those things we'll have to play by ear

1246
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:04,480
because again the new space is going to be a little weird for that especially with twitch

1247
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:09,120
um but we'll see i think we're still having fun here um the way we're doing things i really can't

1248
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:14,400
wait to be in the next space though and i'm really excited to share it all with you um so i'll see

1249
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:20,480
you in two weeks if not maybe a little sooner on my personal feed we'll see maybe maybe but no

1250
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:26,800
promises so have a great week two weeks everybody we'll see you next time here on orange lounge radio
