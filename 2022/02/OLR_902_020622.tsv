0	13320	I've frequently stated how the Wii's runaway success was due largely to Wii Sports and
13320	17080	casual game buyers, and how Wii U's disappointing sales weren't disappointing, they just weren't
17080	18880	the lightning in a bottle that the Wii was.
18880	22080	If that's true, then how has the Nintendo Switch exceeded Wii's console sales?
22080	25280	Is it the appeal of the docked and mobile switching nature, 2-in-1 value?
25280	28800	Has the depth of the game library been valuable for every Nintendo target demographic?
28800	30240	These are questions I've asked rhetorically.
30240	33520	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give you the underlying
33520	36280	numbers and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where
36280	37280	every gamer has a voice.
37280	38280	Hello, my friends out there on this internet.
38280	48120	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48120	55480	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again, episode number 902 of our show
55480	59760	for this February the 8th of 2022.
59760	63720	My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined by my co-hosts.
63720	68160	Say hello as always to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
68160	69160	Hello.
69160	70160	Hi.
70160	71160	How are you?
71160	72160	I'm okay.
72160	73160	Good.
73160	78880	I'm having OBS problems tonight for some weird reason, and I'm seeing something completely
78880	80680	different other than...
80680	81680	There you are.
81680	82680	Hello.
82680	83680	Okay.
83680	84680	Whew.
84880	86880	And all the joy will be when we...
86880	87880	I've been here.
87880	88880	No, I know you have.
88880	91440	It was showing something else on my screen.
91440	96240	So all the joy is when we broadcast live here at the Voice Geeks Network, because we do tape
96240	100400	live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf
100400	105320	show at the Voice Geeks Network on Twitch, twitch.tv slash V-O-G network.
105320	107120	Did I leave anything out?
107120	111760	No, I think I got it all.
111760	115800	Next week is the decommissioning of Studio N7.
115800	119960	Do you have any favorite Studio N7 memories, Dark Sakura?
119960	120960	Coffee.
120960	121960	Coffee.
121960	122960	Oh yeah.
122960	123960	Making a lot, because...
123960	127880	I don't have coffee tonight, because husband said you might go to Starbucks.
127880	128880	Yeah.
128880	131880	Mr. Smoosh says snort.
131880	135200	But yeah, hopefully you can come see the new play.
135200	138920	Of course, for those that missed the news, Alan and I are moving to a new place.
138920	144680	So this studio will be no more after really next week's episode is going to be the last
144680	145680	one.
145680	152000	So it'll be the last chance to celebrate a lot of shows from this studio.
152000	158640	And because honestly, the transition from us being on Shoutcast to Twitch to virtual
158640	160560	kind of all happened here.
160560	164520	So it's been a lot of change for the show here.
164520	166520	Also say hello tonight to Techmaster Loki.
166520	167520	Hello.
167520	168520	Hey, Loki.
169120	170120	What's that game playing behind you tonight?
170120	171120	I'm trying to see.
171120	172120	Lil Nemo.
172120	177640	Oh my gosh, I haven't played that game in a very long time.
177640	178640	What made you want to play that?
178640	181240	Or what made you think of that one for your background tonight?
181240	184520	I don't know.
184520	185520	So many games I've already picked.
185520	187720	I was like, I gotta pick something different.
187720	188720	Sure, sure.
188720	189720	I understand.
189720	195320	Hey, I know you had an update to give on a frequent guest contributor to the program.
195320	196320	Yeah.
197120	200720	So it's been a rough week.
200720	207220	So I found out that the sickness I had last week that we thought was not COVID was COVID.
207220	211800	So there's that, which is fun.
211800	222140	So unfortunately, I knew last week that we were going to schedule my cat to be put down.
222140	231380	And so it's just her health had been kind of, not like getting, it had been gradually
231380	232380	getting worse.
232380	239140	She's been losing weight for, oh gosh, like at least a year and a half.
239140	243660	She was down to under probably around five pounds at the time.
243660	246340	Just all skin and bones, basically.
246340	251700	No matter what we would try to give her, it wasn't really doing anything.
251700	257300	And no, she's just, they didn't know what was wrong with her.
257300	259660	She had neurological problems at one point.
259660	263540	We thought that she might have had a stroke because she was kind of circling in certain
263540	264540	directions.
264540	270000	That seemed to get better, because I thought she was going blind to it for a while.
270000	275780	But then, so we just made the choice that's like, okay, it's not getting any better.
275780	277380	It's something we can really do for her.
277380	284740	We had some pretty rough weeks where she was just throwing up and diarrhea and all that
284740	285740	stuff.
285740	286740	She stopped grooming herself.
286740	291180	So yeah, unfortunately on a Thursday, we had to put her down.
291180	292180	Yeah.
292180	293440	I'm really sorry to hear that.
293440	299540	And I know that's not an easy decision, but I know you did what's right for Stella and
299540	301620	it was probably a lot harder for you.
301620	308080	It was especially hard knowing that I knew when it was going to happen.
308080	316780	So I had four days to like, so I just try to spend as much time with her as I could.
316780	318420	And good on you doing that.
318420	323440	So many pets don't get to have a great home and a great place to be, but you certainly
323440	324440	gave her one.
324440	331300	So I think she's very appreciative for that, as is anybody who is a lover of cats for sure.
331300	334940	And nothing but love coming from our chat room right now, of course.
334940	335940	Yeah.
335940	340900	And it's just still, it's getting used to, I still like, you know, as I'm sitting here
340900	345060	at my desk, I'm like, Oh, I better not, like, I better put my foot a certain way so it'll
345060	347220	kick her in the head and she's not there.
347220	349820	So it's like, it's tough.
349820	353660	And then I can't even imagine, I was like that with, with Shermy.
353660	354660	Yeah.
354660	357860	And I can't even imagine having to deal with COVID on top of all of that.
357860	361260	So just, you've, you've had a rough, I'm actually kind of surprised.
361260	362260	You're here.
362260	364540	You've had a rough week.
364540	369040	But I hope, I hope the show can help take your mind off it a little bit, but yeah, it's
369040	370380	been getting easier every day.
370380	374060	It's just, you know, it's tough.
374060	378540	But I'm sure our listeners, I know I do, are thankful, you know, this, this whole virtual
378540	380700	setup wasn't supposed to happen.
380700	385100	It wasn't supposed to go like this two years ago, but I'm glad that we were able to meet
385100	389780	Stella and I'm glad you were able to kind of share her with so many people throughout,
389780	390780	you know, the world.
391300	394140	Thanks to what we do here on Sunday nights and our little show.
394140	398880	So lots of people, lots of people feeling that in a chat.
398880	402980	And as Bobby Blackwolf puts it, we can shit post about video games for the next few hours
402980	404380	to take your mind off it.
404380	405580	Sounds good.
405580	409780	And SSJ100Matt with a nice thing that's kind of sums up a lot of the comments and chats
409780	414340	saying, RIP Stella, you and your family gave her a wonderful life and she shared so much
414340	415340	love to you guys.
415340	416340	She did the right thing.
416340	417340	Yeah.
417340	418340	All right.
418340	419500	Well, let's go ahead.
419500	420500	We're going to move on.
421220	422420	We're going to get into our kickoff topic for the night.
422420	423820	Actually, I kind of have two things.
423820	427020	I have a quick thing for the top of the show before we get into the main kickoff topic
427020	428820	that is up on the board.
428820	434020	I am sometimes I get messages from people that listen to the show and friend, you know,
434020	436180	people become my friends from the show.
436180	438700	I'm a normal person, just like everybody else out there.
438700	443400	Well, I've got problems, but don't we all I'm just normal here, right?
443400	447500	So like, you know, people will message me and, you know, I do try to respond best I
447500	448500	can.
448500	450980	I'm really bad and my husband will be the first.
450980	455900	I'm really bad about reading a message and then oops, I got distracted during something
455900	457500	else and I never get around to responding.
457500	461980	I am really bad at that, especially if you message me during the show.
461980	467060	I am trying to do something else right now, but I get DMS on Twitter.
467060	472500	I get, you know, messages on Facebook and, you know, sometimes it's questions about video
472500	475020	games or what's my hot take on a certain thing.
475020	477040	And I'll, you know, give my hot take.
477080	480960	This one though kind of made me go, ooh, I should talk about that on OLR.
480960	485740	So I got a message on Facebook that said, and I guess I can just say it's from Codeman
485740	492400	who used to be here live, but I guess I think he's been a listener for a long time.
492400	496060	I think he just more listens on the podcast feed these days than live.
496060	500840	So a Codeman sent me a message that was like, hey, honest question, does this Pokemon game
500840	503280	seem rushed to you?
503280	506760	And we were talking, you know, because we've talked a little bit on the show about Pokemon
506760	510940	Legends and I was talking about my review last week about my impressions and I really
510940	513200	do enjoy it as a Pokemon game.
513200	515580	And honestly, now here we are another week into it.
515580	519480	And I actually said, I need a little more time with this, but I think this might be
519480	522040	my favorite Pokemon game they've done yet.
522040	525800	And I think I'm at the point where I can say, yes, this is my favorite Pokemon game they've
525800	527040	done yet.
527040	529360	That doesn't mean it's without its flaws.
529360	532840	And as I pointed out last week, a lot of that is in the technical space, right?
532840	539000	It looks like a PlayStation 3 RPG with, you know, a lot of the waves, the scenery looks
539000	540360	and things like that.
540360	546760	And I think it just falls into the hands of the ever long running joke that Nintendo just
546760	551920	can't compete in the technological department, but especially so the Pokemon company and
551920	554500	Game Freak.
554500	558040	And it was interesting because, you know, I gave my kind of take on this and I'll give
558040	559600	it to you guys in a minute.
559600	564120	But then Codeman kind of pointed out, I've noticed that Sword and Shield look drastically
564120	566480	better graphics wise than this game.
566480	568360	That's why I asked now.
568360	571720	And I agree, Sword and Shield was a better looking game.
571720	575680	It is a little bit apple to oranges in the fact that, you know, while, yes, Sword and
575680	581840	Shield had very wide open areas, it was a very different sort of open area than I think
581840	583360	what we get in this game.
583360	587240	And I think that should be noted as to, you know,
587760	591920	Sword and Shield struggle with like some of those open areas, like didn't like wasn't
591920	596720	the game pretty solid, but like when you got to those big open areas is like kind of chugging
596720	597720	a bit.
597720	603860	Sometimes I think I think also docked versus handheld would play into that a little bit.
603860	605320	And I only play docked.
605320	608360	So and usually the game will stutter more in handheld.
608360	611760	I pretty much only play games in docked mode on the switch.
611760	613000	So it's hard for me.
613000	619960	But yes, I mean, even Sword and Shield kind of plays into the old argument of LOL, Nintendo
619960	622520	doesn't make technologically great games.
622520	626800	But then, you know, Breath of the Wild exists and it existed on the Wii U.
626800	630240	So that is very true, right?
630240	631240	Absolutely.
631240	633720	And and, you know, folks in chat, of course, jumping right in.
633720	637640	Mike Deff says it's not perfect, but what it does, it does so good.
637640	638640	And I absolutely agree.
638640	642120	And again, I just said this is probably my favorite Pokemon game.
642240	647120	I mean, yes, we can kind of say technologically, it's got some issues, but you know what?
647120	649320	At the end of the day, does it really matter?
649320	653000	Eh, no, but I think a lot of us just kind of look at it.
653000	657840	And I said this last week, but I'm going to reiterate the frustrating part is that we
657840	658840	look at it.
658840	663880	We see the potential because we see the, I don't know, Horizon Forbidden West of the
663880	664880	world.
664880	668640	We see the Forza Horizon fives of the world.
668640	673400	We see all these, actually, wait, did I just add an extra Forza Horizon game?
673400	674400	I think I did.
674400	676400	But someday there'll be a five.
676400	679640	I think I just added another game in the series.
679640	683680	We all know it's coming, but we all see the Forza Horizon series of the world and we see
683680	689000	all these games and it's like, why can't Nintendo be that?
689000	694960	And to quote a famous drag queen, you will never be glamour.
694960	698480	And I think Nintendo is kind of okay being that.
698480	699480	Okay.
699480	700720	I'm losing track of games.
700720	701720	Thank you, Bobby.
701720	703520	Bobby says Forza Horizon 5 is the current game.
703520	705240	I had to like count in my head.
705240	706240	Okay.
706240	711520	Anyway, you know what I was, the point I was getting at though is that Pokemon Legends
711520	713260	Arceus isn't that.
713260	716240	It's not that in the graphical sense.
716240	720000	So the question, I want to go back to the question that Codeman raised is that does
720000	722720	this Pokemon game seem rushed to you?
722720	727440	And my answer is no, but, and here's the real hot take.
727440	729960	And I want to see what you all think of this hot take.
729960	737140	Can you rate this hot take on a scale of one to 10, 10 being like pipe and spicy hot and
737140	739560	one being like cold McDonald's fries.
739560	740560	Okay.
740560	746120	So what do you, what do you think of this hot take and my hot take is, I don't think
746120	752800	it was rushed, but I think the scope of the game changed because I think the reason why
752800	757400	this game isn't technologically pushing the way it ought to is because it was originally
757400	762280	designed to be the launch game for the Switch Pro.
762280	766600	And when the Switch Pro suddenly didn't happen because of chip shortage, well I shouldn't
766600	770800	say suddenly didn't happen because I think that's been in the making for a while.
770800	775840	I think when it didn't happen because of chip shortages and things of that nature, they
775840	780280	decided to release the game anyway because the Pokemon games are on a timetable and what
780280	781280	have you.
781280	785480	But I think a Pokemon style Breath of the Wild candidate would have been the perfect
785480	792800	game to release a new type of like upgraded Switch and all that with, and I, and I think
792800	797000	maybe some more of that potential and maybe some of the stutter and things like that probably
797000	798760	would have been there on a Switch Pro.
798760	802600	And so that's my hot take is that no, I don't think it was rushed, but I think they had
802600	807240	to change it and suddenly as high as it was going to go was the Switch and there wasn't
807240	811200	going to be a Switch Pro in that situation.
811200	815160	Mike Deft in chat says, Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl was rushed.
815160	818160	Legends RKS wasn't rushed.
818160	822080	Mike Deft says, Game Freak has never been praised for their graphics.
822080	826680	Fifth Dream in chat says, Nintendo consoles are one to five gens behind and Pokemon games
826680	828880	are half more behind than that.
828880	832280	I think that's a pretty good way to put it, summarize it there.
832280	836760	D'Artezio says, Yes, I could see that as a big franchise, but like not a big game that
836760	840640	does seem to track as launch title, right?
840640	843200	Sometimes Nintendo kind of does this with their launch titles.
843200	846880	I mean, it's not, you can't say they always do it, but like, look at the launch of the
846880	848440	GameCube.
848440	854840	Like Luigi's Mansion was kind of like their Mario game, but it wasn't really a Mario game
854840	856280	at all.
856280	858700	It was very different.
858700	862940	And so, you know, I think and plus, we know that the Switch Pro, I think, would have been
862940	868060	in mid-grade and anything that was designed for it should work on the Nintendo Switch.
868060	872740	And I think that's why this game still came out at the end of the day is because it was
872740	876820	designed to run on the Nintendo Switch, just like, you know, Breath of the Wild was designed
876820	879220	to run on the Wii U and all that stuff.
879220	884220	Zelda Twilight Princess was designed to run on the GameCube and the Nintendo Wii and all
884220	885220	that stuff.
885260	890300	I just think that it ended up at some point, we're not going to release it on a Switch
890300	891580	Pro after all.
891580	896940	I think if they do release a Switch Pro in the next year or so, I kind of don't think
896940	899020	they will at this point.
899020	905420	But if they do, and then suddenly this game works on it or there's a game of the year
905420	910860	edition with the rumored DLC that comes out and all that stuff, I think it almost just
910860	916180	guarantees I'm right in this situation.
916180	919820	If it doesn't happen, I still kind of want to be right, but I may not be, and that's
919820	920820	fine.
920820	921820	I realize it's a hot take.
921820	927820	S2100 Matt says, Game Freak still using the Game Boy era Pokemon growls is a troll for
927820	929260	the haters at this point.
929260	934180	Did you notice that even Pikachu and Eevee have the Game Boy growls?
934180	937900	There's not even a Pikachu in every Pokemon game.
937940	945380	Even on Pokemon Yellow, Pikachu went Pikachu and doesn't do it here.
945380	949540	I think that's more to try to fit in with the lore.
949540	953660	You can call it corner cutting, but I think you can say there's an argument to be made
953660	959300	about the whole, it's historical, it's the first Pokedex, it's when Pokemon were still
959300	965740	violent and all this stuff that maybe plays into that and why they can kind of do that.
966580	971940	Anyway, LM Orchard in chat says, How'd Pikachu go again?
971940	972940	Pikachu.
972940	973940	Pikachu.
973940	976940	Yeah, Jamie does it better.
976940	977940	All right.
977940	982060	Well, also, Pikachu's voice actor is a lady.
982060	985220	Yes, Bulbasaur is a lady, too.
985220	986380	She was at Dragon Con one year.
986380	988560	I think several of them are ladies.
988560	993840	Not all of them, though, of course, because I think the director of the first Pokemon
993840	996680	movie or something does one of the voices of one of the Pokemon.
996680	997680	So, anyway.
997680	998680	All right.
998680	1000120	I just want to answer that.
1000120	1004000	I thought it was an interesting question, and I wanted to put that hot take at the start
1004000	1005600	of the show.
1005600	1008880	Let's get to another hot take going around the gaming industry right now.
1008880	1013880	Rumors, rumors, rumors, although this, I don't know if I would put this in the rumor department
1013880	1018280	because it's more a little bit like there is smoke and potentially fire.
1018280	1023520	It's something that Business Insider reported on, which has a little bit more of a reputation
1023520	1024720	for getting things.
1024720	1028320	Although it's interesting, their entire site is paywalled, or at least the story is.
1028320	1033040	So a lot of people are having a report on the report.
1033040	1037320	But many game blogs are pointing out that Business Insider has run a report that says
1037320	1042480	Stadia has basically been demoted within Google.
1042480	1049440	And I want to hear what Dark Soccer thinks of this, too, as Twitch's premier Stadia streamer.
1049440	1051840	But I would need to see the report.
1051880	1056240	Let me get to some of the information that is coming out of this first.
1056240	1061480	Apparently, Phil Harrison, and why they're calling this a demotion, basically, Phil Harrison,
1061480	1069240	who is the VP, I'm sorry, Phil Harrison now reports to Google's VP of Subscription Services
1069240	1073520	instead of directly to Rick Osterlow, who is Google's hardware boss.
1073520	1078440	And I think that movement is the catalyst for this whole story in this report.
1078440	1082920	I think people are really running with this, and now you want to talk about hot takes.
1082920	1087480	You're seeing the hot takes on Twitter where people are already eulogizing Stadia.
1087480	1089800	I'm not sure it's quite that.
1089800	1092160	In fact, I think we're quite a ways away from that.
1092160	1098500	However, the report goes on to say, the reason for this is disappointing sales and performing
1098500	1101080	far below Google's expectations.
1101080	1105600	Google Stadia will now be focusing on lucrative deals with other companies to create and power
1105600	1107540	experiences for them.
1107540	1111860	Folks are talking about a deal with Peloton Bikes, which I think is very interesting,
1111860	1116140	and it's going to be powered by Google Stream, which people are saying is just Google Stadia
1116140	1117660	under a different name.
1117660	1121240	It's the same technology.
1121240	1122740	Very interesting.
1122740	1129140	But I guess now only about 20% focus at Stadia is on the gaming side as was before, and this
1129140	1135820	is according to an insider who gossiped to, appropriately, Business Insider.
1135820	1139420	What's also interesting about this and what lends the Business Insider report to some
1139420	1143860	credibility potentially is that Google Stadia kind of responded, but they responded with
1143860	1148920	their tongue in their cheek with a tweet that said, if you hear one thing, hear this.
1148920	1153940	The Stadia team is working really hard on a great future for Stadia and cloud gaming.
1153940	1157780	We hope you agree, and we know the proof is in the playing.
1157780	1162140	The source went on to talk to Business Insider saying, there are plenty of people internally
1162140	1166140	who would love to keep it going, so they are working really hard to make sure it doesn't
1166140	1171060	die, but they're not the ones writing the checks.
1171060	1172060	It doesn't seem like-
1172060	1173940	I'm reading the Business Insider article right now.
1173940	1174940	Oh, fun.
1174940	1176420	I'll get your take on that in just a moment.
1176420	1177420	Let me get a couple-
1177420	1181540	Yeah, for the record, if you ever want to get past a paywall, go to archive.js and put
1181540	1183620	in the URL, and it should load it up.
1183620	1185220	There you go.
1185220	1190380	Apparently, Google will not probably pull the plug on Stadia anytime soon, but it's
1190380	1196060	just kind of playing into the whole- Google didn't really play off as much as they wanted.
1196060	1199940	So I don't think they're going to shut Stadia down tomorrow or anything like that, but here's
1199940	1200940	what it is.
1200940	1206160	And then I definitely want to let Jamie have a say here as our Stadia expert, I guess.
1206160	1211100	What it is, is this is just playing right into the hands of a lot of people that when
1211100	1215940	Stadia launched, they said, Google's going to treat this like they do everything else.
1215940	1220160	They're going to give it two years to be successful, and if it doesn't, they're going to cut it
1220160	1223400	off at the kneecaps, just like all these other things they launch.
1223400	1227960	And so people are now reading this, and even though they're not really hearing- Google
1227960	1232440	Stadia is not being shut down, it's just being deprioritized.
1232440	1238080	Everybody's kind of going, well, we all knew that's what was going to happen.
1238080	1239080	Here it is.
1239080	1240720	That's not at all what I think this is saying.
1240720	1241720	Go ahead.
1241720	1242720	Just looking this over.
1242720	1245200	What's your take on this?
1245240	1253280	What I think is happening is that they're branching out the technology for Stadia.
1253280	1254280	Stadia isn't going anywhere.
1254280	1255280	They're still supporting it.
1255280	1256280	They're still bringing stuff out.
1256280	1262280	They just actually had a big sale for the Capcom licenses.
1262280	1267460	I just got the deluxe Resident Evil Village for like 40 bucks.
1267460	1271420	So they're still pushing on it.
1271420	1276860	What I think it is is that they're licensing the technology to get more out of it.
1276860	1282700	I mean, yeah, they've lost some money on it, but it still has a very dedicated user base.
1282700	1289940	And again, for people like me who play on a Mac, for example, it's a better alternative
1289940	1294960	in my book to using the NVIDIA service.
1294960	1300020	I don't want to use the NVIDIA service, I mean, because it just hasn't worked out as
1300020	1304040	well for me.
1304040	1312520	That being said, I think that they're trying to confirm their own bias is what I think
1312520	1314240	is happening.
1314240	1320120	And so that's why the Stadia crew had to go in and do damage control, because if anyone
1320120	1325480	is going to know if it's going to continue or how it's going to be supported, it's going
1325480	1330060	to be the people that are behind it, right?
1330060	1334180	And they say that there's some things coming out that they can't talk about, but it does
1334180	1339060	make it seem like there's going to be new titles and maybe even new services.
1339060	1345060	And they're already talking about UI improvements, like having ways to sort through your games
1345060	1347220	and having a different type.
1347220	1350140	They just added in the search feature.
1350140	1353860	They've really been stepping up the interface for Stadia.
1353860	1365280	Now I'm really reading this more, especially since Google tried to work with Bungie and
1365280	1368120	we're even looking at acquiring them before Sony stepped in.
1368120	1373080	We'll get to that.
1373080	1379820	And on top of that, they also worked with AT&T to allow people to stream Batman Arkham
1379820	1385240	Knight directly through the web browser.
1385240	1392440	But Google's branding wasn't on it, but AT&T definitely said it's running on Stadia's technology.
1392440	1397040	So I think that they're looking to branch out their streaming technology to other services
1397040	1404120	like Peloton or maybe other developers to have their stuff out.
1404120	1412120	They've even pitched using Stadia services as beta testing for PC games that are going
1412120	1415380	to be coming in, PC, Mac games, whatever, that are going to be coming out.
1415380	1423920	So that's what I'm reading into this, especially with bringing up the information about branching
1423920	1424920	out like that.
1424920	1429500	I really do think of it as a branching out.
1429500	1434240	I think it wasn't a big priority because Google's always been like, if it's not an
1434240	1441740	overnight success, then it's not a success and need to learn to play the longevity game.
1441740	1447380	On top of that too, there's been plenty of companies that have just absolutely adopted
1447380	1452140	the service and find it very useful.
1452140	1459340	I don't want to be alarmist and I don't want to believe any kind of hype until I see a
1459340	1462500	official word from the official people.
1462500	1466340	I'll take all of this with a grain of salt, but what I'm translating this to is just that
1466340	1470480	they're going to be expanding that technology and using it in different ways so the gaming
1470480	1474460	platform may not seem like it's getting as much attention.
1474460	1478740	I think it's going to be getting as much attention, but other aspects of it will be getting attention
1478740	1480140	as well.
1480140	1483820	I'm of two minds with this and I think a lot of what you say really does hit the nail on
1483820	1487700	the head because I do think Google is certainly...
1487700	1493380	Why limit the streaming technology to gaming when there's other spaces where it makes sense
1493380	1497560	to grow this technology into such as like the Peloton thing is actually kind of interesting
1497560	1504540	to me and whatever else might be in the future for mobile and these sorts of things, absolutely.
1504540	1510000	I don't think we should be eulogizing Stadia by any means at this point and I think a lot
1510000	1516500	of that is still very premature and I think there are very exciting uses like you talk
1516500	1522560	about like the betas and being able to preview things without necessarily downloading something
1522560	1526240	to your computer where pirates can get in there and data mine, or excuse me, hackers
1526240	1528700	whatever can get in there and data mine things.
1528700	1531840	That actually should be a very lucrative thing for companies to want to get into I would
1531840	1535880	think.
1535880	1539400	Go ahead with your quote because I do have a however with this because I do think there
1539400	1541480	is something we have to realize, but go ahead.
1541480	1545640	Patrick Sabled who is a Google spokesperson, I'm just going to read this verbatim.
1545640	1549960	We announced our intention of helping publishers and partners deliver games directly to gamers
1549960	1552480	last year and we have been working toward that.
1552480	1557160	The first manifestation has been our partnership with AT&T who is offering Batman Arkham Knight
1557160	1559440	available to their customers for free.
1559440	1564280	While we won't be commenting on any rumors or speculation regarding other industry partners,
1564280	1568440	we are still focused on bringing great games to Stadia in 2022.
1568440	1572280	With 200 plus titles available, we expect to have another hundred plus games added to
1572280	1579400	the platform this year and currently have 50 games available to claim in Stadia Pro.
1579400	1586380	So getting into my however, I do think that Google is taking a focus off of gaming a little
1586380	1591620	bit and what the original intent was behind Stadia and I think you know the reorganization
1591620	1593160	makes that very clear.
1593200	1598200	I think the fact that they kind of stopped, you know, they canceled the games that they
1598200	1602280	were making, they sold off the, you know, whatever they were, they don't really have
1602280	1606800	any exclusives in-house anymore and I really think they stopped signing the deals to get
1606800	1609840	the exclusives outside as well.
1609840	1614360	So I think this whole idea that like Google Stadia is a console that's going to compete
1614360	1619880	with Xbox and Switch and the trick is it's not actually a console, it's just there in
1619880	1620880	the cloud.
1620880	1627360	I think that whole image that we've had in our minds, that ain't it anymore and that's
1627360	1628360	what it is.
1628360	1634760	And to be honest, in my opinion, that was all missed messaging from the very beginning.
1634760	1642800	And quite honestly, I think the biggest problem in Stadia's pocket right now, I don't think
1642800	1645400	Phil Harrison is a very good leader.
1645400	1650880	I just don't think he's, I think he's misfired the messaging on this from the very beginning.
1650880	1653200	I don't think he's very good for the company.
1653200	1655320	It's like he has a history of doing this.
1655320	1656320	Exactly.
1656320	1658800	I think Phil Harrison is the problem.
1658800	1664000	And what's going to be interesting, I will bet, I will bet money he leaves within the
1664000	1665000	next year.
1665000	1666000	He's gone.
1666000	1672320	And people are going to use that to further eulogize Stadia when in fact that would actually
1672320	1675560	probably be the best possible thing that could happen to the platform in my opinion.
1675560	1680800	Can you go join the Amico team?
1680800	1684240	Not going there.
1684240	1690160	But I, it's interesting because I think if you were to go back to when this was first
1690160	1695200	announced, I was very apprehensive about cloud gaming, you know, and I was very much like,
1695200	1697520	I don't think this is the right thing.
1697520	1699400	There's too many bandwidth caps.
1699400	1701960	There's too many, you know, restrictions.
1701960	1705360	How is somebody going to play 4K 60 frames a second?
1705360	1707400	And that was my, my frame of thought.
1707400	1709000	I'll admit that.
1709000	1714280	It honestly wasn't until on this program, Dark Soccer was saying, this is a way for
1714280	1720840	me to play shit on my Mac that I started to go, huh?
1720840	1727360	And then Cyberpunk 2077 comes out and the best experience for that game is on Google
1727360	1728520	Stadia.
1728520	1731200	And I started to go, huh?
1731200	1735040	And now I'm hearing about these betas and doesn't it make sense to do that more for
1735040	1736480	the cloud and so forth.
1736480	1740060	And I'm really starting to go, interesting.
1740060	1746440	So I think I've really warmed up to the idea of what this cloud and how it fits into gaming's
1746440	1747440	future.
1747440	1753080	And I do think cloud gaming to some extent is going to be in the future of games.
1753080	1756600	And I've said this before on the show is I've kind of been making this transition in my
1756600	1763500	own thinking is that as 5G gets more and more popular, as more and more people work
1763500	1769720	from home and cable companies and so forth get challenged on their data bandwidth caps
1769720	1772940	as we get more and more connected and so on and so on.
1772940	1776480	And I'm talking about things that happen 10 years from now.
1776480	1778640	I'm not talking about things that happen next year or the year after.
1778640	1781220	I'm talking about the long game people.
1781220	1783800	I'm talking about OLR in our 50s.
1783800	1784800	Okay.
1784800	1787280	Cloud gaming, I think there is.
1787280	1791640	And that's why so many people are getting into it in very different ways.
1791640	1796400	And now you have, and this ended up being, I think a bit of an issue for Google as well.
1796400	1801040	Google gets into it, Amazon gets into it, Microsoft gets into it, Nvidia gets into it.
1801040	1805960	I mean, there are a lot of cloud gaming solutions right now.
1805960	1811560	And I think the person that's playing the game the best, in my opinion, not from a technological
1811560	1815240	perspective, but from a marketing perspective is Microsoft.
1815240	1821040	And the reason why I say that is because they're not trying to like make a big deal of it.
1821040	1826520	They're making it an option and they're subtly, it's like they're putting it on a plate and
1826520	1829280	they're subtly nudging it in front of somebody.
1829280	1831320	Here, eat this.
1831320	1833800	You already have this Microsoft game pass.
1833800	1836200	Did you know you can play all of these games on the cloud?
1836200	1837600	Just click here to start that.
1837600	1839160	Here, eat this.
1839160	1842640	Whereas I think the problem that Stadia was challenged with and the messaging I think
1842640	1846920	they misfired on was the whole, you've got to fucking have this.
1846920	1848560	Cloud gaming is the future.
1848560	1852120	And Stadia, you can play it on a Chromecast and all that stuff, even though it's not going
1852120	1853120	to launch that way.
1853120	1857440	And it's not going to look that way for like six months into it and so forth.
1857440	1862240	But I sort of think Microsoft is playing the long game on that.
1862240	1864920	And I think that's going to be successful for them.
1865320	1869600	And again, I'm not saying that Stadia is going to fail, but I think Stadia misfired.
1869600	1871800	And I think it's Phil Harrison's fault.
1873800	1878640	Well, I did sign up for Amazon's service.
1878640	1882680	Luna is the beta for it.
1882680	1888440	And I'm really looking to see how it compares, you know.
1888440	1895520	So I'm still going to stay with Stadia as long as I can until I get my PC rebuilt and
1895520	1898320	then can just play Dead by Daylight on Steam.
1898320	1905200	Well, because I think that because my accounts linked all of my achievements and whatever
1905200	1909400	and my hours will transfer over, I hope.
1909400	1915240	But that's pretty much the thing I'm playing on Stadia that and I was playing Cyberpunk,
1915240	1919440	but I'm going to play Resident Evil, although I have other ideas for things I'm going to
1919440	1920440	play now.
1920440	1921440	Yeah.
1921440	1928400	But I mean, I don't think your crown as the premier Stadia streamer on Twitch is going
1928400	1933520	to go anywhere anytime soon because I think Stadia is staying around for a little bit.
1933520	1938160	But I just don't think we're going to see Stadia exclusives or, you know, I don't think
1938160	1942040	we're going to see a narrative really pushed where like Stadia is this.
1942040	1945480	I think it's just going to it's going to be there and it's a thing that exists and it's
1945480	1947280	a thing that you can buy games on.
1947280	1953840	And another way to do it, I think, is is kind of what what it is at this point.
1953840	1957720	Interesting perspective from Fifth Dream in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network
1957720	1963100	who says this stuff is this stuff now is like VR in the 90s.
1963100	1969120	It didn't take off on the first go, but eventually will accept it and it will be taken for granted.
1969120	1970120	Interesting.
1970200	1974640	You know, the graphics and VR weren't all that in the beginning.
1974640	1978920	And I think a lot of that had to catch up a bit to make it because now everybody thinks
1978920	1982960	of 90s VR and they think of that movie, The Lawnmower Man, and you go back and you watch
1982960	1986400	that movie now and it's like, fuck, this was ridiculous.
1986400	1989240	But that's that's what VR kind of look like in the 90s.
1989240	1990240	Right.
1990240	1991960	For those of us that lived it.
1991960	1993480	But now it's very different.
1993480	1997080	So I haven't thought movie in an age.
1997080	1999280	I think most people have it.
1999440	2000440	All right.
2000440	2002120	Anyway, let's go ahead and move on.
2002120	2004640	We're going to talk about our gaming weeks.
2004640	2007720	Let's talk about how is your gaming week?
2007720	2010540	We'll move over to Dark Sakura and I'll start with you.
2010540	2013040	How is your gaming week?
2013040	2014040	Productive.
2014040	2015040	Yeah.
2015040	2018840	I played Mass Effect 2.
2018840	2019840	Nice.
2019840	2024800	On through Windows 11 ARM.
2024800	2029400	And it it had like right at first it had some syncing issues.
2029400	2031240	And then after that, it was fine.
2031240	2034380	I even got my old save files to work.
2034380	2039660	The thing is that the the first Mass Effect save files will not work.
2039660	2042920	And you know, I imported like some of my old favorites.
2042920	2048480	I'm probably going to start the game over and live stream it, I think.
2048480	2051120	But I've I've I had fun with it.
2051120	2055560	Now the only other things that I'm trying to do is that like the save file editor, it
2055560	2058120	will not run in this version of Windows.
2058120	2060040	So I have to find something else.
2060040	2066440	But but so far, I mean, it's it's the game I love and remember, you know, had a good
2066440	2067440	time with it.
2067440	2068480	It looks good.
2068480	2073840	There's already high res textures for it, like even more high res.
2073840	2078400	So I'm I'm just enjoying I'm enjoying it, you know, I'm playing and of course, playing
2078400	2081720	copious amounts of Dead by Daylight.
2081720	2086720	I'm kind of like, it's something that like goes off in my brain that the moment I hit
2086720	2089440	like silver ranks, I'm just sort of like, okay, I don't care anymore.
2089440	2093900	I'm just gonna play, you know, meme around with people like.
2093900	2095880	I don't know how this came about.
2095880	2102920	But when I was playing last night, I was in like the the airy, the the crow ladies area.
2102920	2105580	And it was his arena just standing there.
2105580	2106580	And I was playing Freddy.
2106580	2110540	And we just both nodded at each other and then went in different directions and ended
2110540	2118060	up that like, there was another fuck, what's her name from Halloween, Laurie, Laurie.
2118060	2121060	Yeah, there was a Laurie there and I was playing her normal.
2121060	2123940	And then I guess she and the arena player were friends or something.
2123940	2128700	But then we just sort of just played around and we, you know, farmed the generators a
2128700	2129700	little bit.
2129700	2133380	And I let Laurie out and then Serena showed me the hatch and I closed the hatch and then
2133380	2134380	Serena left.
2134380	2137620	So it was just like a funny little game.
2137620	2142000	And then I had like a mid, you know, a mid game boop match.
2142000	2146700	I've just been having fun because like people are are being, you know, salty and sweaty
2146700	2149220	and just taking things too seriously.
2149220	2150380	And last night I just gave a shit.
2150380	2155900	I just wanted to play, you know, play around, let people know there's another person here.
2155900	2161420	But I've started doing something in my postgame chat that actually has made my experience
2161420	2163420	in the game a lot better.
2163460	2168060	And that's just saying, hey, I had fun.
2168060	2170300	Have a great evening.
2170300	2175060	You know, even if someone was a shit, you know, you know, I might say, well, what was
2175060	2179340	this like, like I had a Jane player last night, there's, you know, when you go into the basement
2179340	2185380	and the stairs turn to the side, there's a corner there that if someone's not down, it
2185380	2190380	will clip them into that corner and you can't pick them up until I basically worked until
2190380	2191860	I picked her up and got her there.
2192300	2195900	You know, that was the only comment I said was like, you know, other than that exploit
2195900	2198060	by the Jane player, you know, I had fun.
2198060	2200460	I mean, I didn't do, you know, don't win or anything.
2200460	2201180	I was playing huntress.
2201180	2203820	I'm not good at her, but I had a fun time.
2203820	2210580	And I'll make sure that I want people to leave a game that they're playing with me having
2210580	2211700	a good experience.
2212100	2216540	I think a lot of people just say GGWP, but I think because you see that so often, it
2216540	2218180	kind of loses its meaning.
2218700	2220020	It's desensitized, right?
2220020	2220380	Yeah.
2220420	2228220	And so for me, I'm just like, you know, Hey, I had a good time, you know, good game.
2228220	2233180	It was, you know, but the big thing is me just saying, have a good night.
2234420	2239860	And it changes the entire conversation instead of a, Oh, you got shitted on or whatever.
2239860	2244540	Like, it was like, I just flat out instead of, you know, someone started with that and
2244540	2245940	they said, Oh, just were you having an off night?
2245940	2248780	Like, yeah, I was just, you know, memeing around and like, Oh, okay, that's cool.
2248980	2250460	You know, well, better luck next time.
2250460	2251580	I was like, yeah, you have a good one.
2253100	2258220	Made, I even found a person that I got on two different characters on two different
2258220	2258740	matches.
2258940	2259860	So I rated them.
2261220	2267660	Now here's how many bits dark Sakura for you to start off that chat very nice and pleasant.
2267860	2270220	And then at the end say, now go get shit on.
2270260	2270740	Good night.
2272300	2276300	How many bits to get you to tell someone to go fuck themselves?
2276780	2278260	I do it for 2,500 bits.
2278500	2279020	All right.
2279300	2279820	Noted.
2280700	2281180	Noted.
2281620	2282100	I'll do it.
2282100	2282300	I'll do it.
2282900	2283940	You should put that as a channel.
2283940	2284980	I guess that's not actual money.
2284980	2286140	It was channel points reward.
2286260	2288220	Like 50,000 points get shit on.
2289820	2291540	No, I know, I know.
2291820	2294020	What's it makes me think of losing colors.
2294020	2295220	Uh, GG easy.
2295340	2301740	What used to be like his big premier reward, like for him to say GG easy was like 50,000
2301740	2302660	points or something.
2302660	2307500	But, um, I think because the, the context of the game has changed a little bit, he reduced
2307540	2309540	the number of points you needed for that, but yeah.
2309980	2315900	Well, I spend all of my points on one thing and one thing only, and that's the, uh, rate
2315900	2317660	my, uh, rate, my cosmetics.
2319300	2320740	And I don't even know what it is.
2320740	2325100	Cause you know, the only reason I have survivors anymore is to play dress up with them, but
2325980	2327220	people like my outfits.
2327340	2328940	I guess I have good fashion sense in game.
2328940	2329380	Who knows?
2329700	2333940	For me, I hardly ever redeemed channel points because I'm always saving for the biggest
2333980	2336500	e-ticket item I'm saving for VIP.
2336940	2341900	Uh, you know, or the, you get a sound command and introduction every time you come in here
2341900	2347060	and that those types of high ticket rewards, VIP shout out and a sound command and Nick's
2347060	2347420	channel.
2348140	2352140	Um, I have VIP in droves, hydro.
2353500	2359140	And I think I got it in Isaaco and then Elsie just gave it to me like early on.
2359140	2366460	So, but I, but I mean, but if I, if I'm in somebody's channel that much, I want to be
2367500	2372300	I want to be productive and help them out and promote them while I'm there, you know?
2372740	2379900	So, um, I'm still though, I think I put play survivor as my high level redeem and mine.
2381540	2384940	Although I might, I might play tonight.
2385700	2388580	If I get people to play with me, I have to get people to play with me.
2388820	2390660	I'm I might be on, we'll see.
2391460	2391620	All right.
2391620	2395420	Well, the other, the other stuff I played, of course, I played word scapes, um, played
2395820	2397900	Star Trek pinball here at my house.
2398860	2402780	Um, and I am getting things ready.
2402780	2408020	If the, the, uh, tool that I'm using to play it on works, I'm probably going to start
2408020	2409780	streaming a link to the past.
2410620	2412980	Oh, fun for like a retro game night.
2413140	2417980	Um, other than that, like I said, you know, Sam going to, Oh, and Fantasian, of course,
2418100	2422340	which I actually beat a boss that had been giving me fits before and I beat it pretty
2422340	2422780	readily.
2422780	2424460	So it was, it was really cool.
2424980	2425300	Nice.
2426140	2426380	Yeah.
2426580	2428540	All right, let's move on to Loki.
2428540	2429580	How was your gaming week, Loki?
2430260	2434460	Uh, I'm playing Minecraft and more, more power washing sim.
2435660	2436300	Good times.
2436660	2442460	Well, you've had a week, so comfort food games like those, comfort, comfort food games
2442460	2443580	like those go a long way.
2443580	2444020	I'm sure.
2444340	2447060	Dude, someone should just bring you a pot of macaroni and cheese.
2448020	2448780	That's not a game.
2449500	2450380	It should be comfort.
2450540	2451180	It is comfort.
2451660	2455020	What's better than video games and eating a pot of macaroni and cheese by yourself?
2455900	2456700	Mmm.
2456740	2457180	Coffee.
2457180	2457620	I don't know.
2459780	2460300	I don't know.
2461460	2464900	But yeah, I've just been working on, um, the Minecraft stuff.
2464980	2472180	Um, I filmed a little bit of this week and then I started to edit it down, but yeah, new
2472180	2472980	episode comes in.
2474220	2477660	Speaking of, by the way, before I get to my gaming week, uh, since channel point rewards
2477660	2481980	got brought up and mac and cheese, um, we do need to schedule orange lounge foodie-o.
2482100	2486300	I, uh, I know it was, it was delayed for several months because of some things I'm going through.
2486780	2489740	Um, actually I do have a small update in that department.
2489860	2495580	Um, I had, um, uh, update, uh, check on what's called your A1C, which is basically like your
2495580	2497900	average blood sugar over a two to three month period.
2498340	2503620	And, uh, I dropped that number by over three points down to, uh, basically a level that
2503620	2505260	would be considered more pre-diabetic.
2505260	2506220	So that's pretty exciting.
2506580	2511340	Uh, and my doctor actually said in the email to me, you are doing amazing, which is a nice
2511340	2512460	thing to hear from your doctor.
2512460	2518300	So, um, that was a very nice, I mean, it's, it's come with some work and, uh, I'm, I'm third.
2518340	2521820	You maybe you've noticed my, a little bit, cause now I'm getting to the point where like I see
2521820	2526660	it, some of my weight loss, but I've come down 30 pounds, uh, than where I was last summer.
2526660	2529060	So, uh, it's been, it's been an adventure.
2529100	2529660	Thank you.
2529820	2530300	Thank you.
2530660	2534060	Uh, it's more about, more about my health than my looks, but.
2534500	2536820	If I can get you to do weight training with me, that'd be awesome.
2537340	2543100	Well, the nice thing is the new place I'm moving to has like a clubhouse with a gym that we get
2543100	2543940	access to.
2543940	2548620	So, and that I feel better, a little better about that than going to a place like, you know, 24
2548620	2552220	hour, you know, any of those big clubs, because, you know, right now with COVID still, that's a
2552220	2553420	little more exclusive.
2553420	2557780	So it's a higher chance I can get in there when it's just me or one other person.
2557940	2559580	So, um, that'll be easy.
2559620	2561540	I can, I can do more than just walk.
2561660	2565780	And I think in my routine, cause Omicron's kind of kept me from the gym during this whole time.
2566180	2569060	Um, otherwise I would have started working that into my routine.
2569340	2570060	So, yeah.
2571380	2576740	Uh, anyway, my gaming week and other things, uh, honestly, my gaming week this week looks almost
2576740	2578020	exactly like last week.
2578060	2579180	A lot of the same games.
2579180	2581060	I'm still playing a diverse amount of stuff.
2581060	2583140	I'm playing Final Fantasy 14 as I usually do.
2583380	2585180	I'm also continuing Dead by Daylight.
2585180	2587380	I had a bit of an opposite week than Dark Sakura.
2587380	2590980	I was, oh, just, just solo queue is so draining.
2590980	2593220	I rage quit on Monday or Tuesday night.
2593260	2595780	Like I just, I was getting tunneled.
2595780	2597380	I was getting left on the hook.
2597420	2600700	I died on first hook, uh, more than once.
2600700	2602940	Like it was just really irritating stuff.
2603300	2607060	And, uh, I like even Alan heard me go like, fuck this game.
2607060	2608820	Or I just was like really upset.
2609180	2616220	Uh, but then of course, like a dummy, I went back to it yesterday and I was like, all right, maybe this isn't so bad.
2616540	2620020	MMR finally put me in a lower bracket or something and it was a little more manageable.
2620020	2621580	That sounds like an abusive relationship.
2621580	2623940	Pretty much, pretty much, honestly.
2624340	2625820	Um, so there was that as well.
2626100	2628820	Uh, and then, uh, Pokemon Legends Arceus.
2628860	2637540	I've, uh, got past the second area in that and the boss there, uh, which I know some of you will probably already beaten the game and you've gotten through much further than I have.
2637820	2647140	But I think there's a lot of people like me who are playing it very slowly and exploring the areas and catching all the Pokemon and getting items and all that stuff.
2647140	2649500	So, um, I'm still really enjoying that game.
2649500	2650940	It's, uh, it's great.
2650940	2654140	We talked about that a lot at the top of the show though, so I won't add a lot to that.
2654460	2656700	Uh, still played some Taiko no Tatsujin.
2656700	2657980	I bought my first song.
2658420	2664900	I also did my first online match, which I lost, which was bullshit because the other guy didn't get a full combo.
2664900	2667780	I did, but I had more OKs.
2668140	2671380	Um, but I was able to calibrate my TV and it's a little better.
2671620	2674260	Um, but I guess I'm still not hitting as exact.
2674260	2675180	Whatever.
2675420	2677060	Uh, the game is still kind of fun, I guess.
2677220	2680340	Yeah, the, the song I bought was like old school.
2680340	2686940	I think it was called Namcott Melody, uh, because it was old school Namco games, like all mishmashed together.
2687140	2693500	It was like the Pac-Man interlude, then the Mappy interlude, then like, you know, it's just like a bunch of stuff, like all kind of mishmashed together.
2693500	2694140	It was really cute.
2694300	2699100	So, um, but yeah, all that stuff together was pretty much my gaming week.
2699580	2701020	Played a little bit here and a little bit there.
2701700	2702140	All right.
2702380	2704980	Uh, let's move into some other gaming news.
2704980	2709580	Uh, just a reminder though, there will be no live show or podcast in two weeks.
2709820	2722180	Because next week is, uh, the last show in this house with the studio and I'm moving and then, uh, yeah, it's going to be going to be a fresh coat of paint when we get to episode 904, uh, in a few weeks.
2722220	2724620	So, um, yeah, but we will be here next week.
2724820	2729660	I realize next week is a big, silly football game that a lot of people pay attention to.
2729900	2736620	Uh, usually there's a big important concert with that as well, but they decided to go a different route this year than a big diva.
2736780	2737980	Well, I guess they have Mary J.
2737980	2738380	Blige.
2738380	2739140	That's kind of neat.
2739340	2749060	But, um, I'm not, I'm not as excited as I was with say Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira.
2749300	2750180	It's Gaga.
2750180	2756660	It's not quite that, uh, it's a different concert this year and, and the little, uh, game they play around the concert.
2757020	2761620	Um, but just, just to be clear, that doesn't deter us from doing our show.
2761620	2762820	We will still be here next Sunday.
2762820	2765180	Usually I think that we will report on the puppy bowl.
2766060	2767140	Uh, yes.
2767460	2768660	Is that still going on this year?
2768900	2770860	I guess it must be still doing the puppy bowl.
2770940	2771700	When wouldn't it be?
2771700	2772180	I don't know.
2772620	2772980	All right.
2773420	2777780	So, yeah, and like D'Artez uses in chat, it's usually kind of over by then anyway.
2777820	2778340	Yes.
2778500	2785340	So, um, as 200 Matt says, I envision off camera, Rob is surrounded by boxes and a massive Tetris like pattern.
2785620	2787340	Not quite yet.
2787380	2791100	Uh, but maybe next week it'll be a little more like, I would imagine next week.
2791180	2794060	It's not the studio is not like all this stuff on the wall is going to be down.
2794420	2796300	Uh, it's going to look very different in here.
2796620	2800900	Uh, so, uh, yeah, but, um, probably not right now.
2801260	2804580	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf does point out that he will not be here next week.
2804620	2815140	Uh, cause he has a small gathering of folks for, um, the, the little, uh, uh, concert and a side of game that happens next week.
2815300	2819820	Uh, and speaking of food, that's the other big deal about those types of things.
2820020	2826100	You, you go to see your friends, uh, and, uh, it's all about the potluck and teeny weenies.
2826540	2827700	That's basically what it is.
2827700	2831140	It's, uh, next week is a celebration of teeny weenies.
2832780	2833260	All right.
2833940	2834980	Glad they get their day.
2836940	2837740	Let's move on.
2837780	2840340	Uh, let's get to our big headline of the week.
2840380	2841180	Uh, Loki.
2842260	2848740	So Sony has decided to go ahead and purchase bungee for $3.6 billion.
2849140	2863300	Um, now, unlike Activision, Blizzard, or any, like some of the other acquisitions have been happening recently, they are still going to be remaining an independent subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment.
2863780	2868100	And also they're going to be publishing games on multi-platform.
2868460	2870820	So not just PlayStation exclusives.
2871300	2872940	Of course, you know, that can all change down the road.
2873380	2874220	We'll have to wait and see.
2874220	2880820	But for right now, they are committing to at least, um, publishing on other platforms.
2881460	2882580	So that's good.
2882900	2889420	Um, along with that, Sony has been spending, um, money to keep the devs from leaving.
2889420	2901580	So they've spent $1.2 billion of that to, I guess, you know, keep the staff that are there, um, that are working on Destiny 2 from leaving.
2902060	2905180	So, and that'll be paid out over several years.
2906660	2923940	So that's very smart, uh, to make sure you pay to keep the talent and not just, you know, cause if you look at Microsoft and Activision and that whole thing, people have been abandoning ship at Activision left and right and Blizzard and all that because of, um, that, you know, dumb fuck who's leading the company right now.
2924140	2936620	Uh, I'm not talking about Microsoft who has an intelligent, uh, man that's leading the company, but I'm talking about, uh, people abandoning ship at ABK because of the dumb fuck that's running things over there, uh, who, uh, shouldn't have a job anymore.
2936620	2937620	But I digress.
2937820	2941780	My point is it's very smart of Sony to really pay to keep the talent here.
2942060	2953780	Uh, because, uh, yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't know if like Sony has this bad stigma or whatever, where people would be looking to run, but they might be looking to run because they, they fear like the corporate.
2953940	2957060	You know what, whatever it is, or it doesn't match their vision or what have you.
2957140	2958340	Yeah, I suppose.
2958340	2961780	I mean, it's still good to keep your talent around.
2961820	2966580	And right now what they have planned is more live service games.
2967740	2969380	I mean, that's what destiny is, I guess.
2969380	2969900	So.
2971020	2973420	Well, and it makes sense for Sony to have something like that.
2973460	2976540	God, a war isn't that horizon isn't that.
2976660	2979900	So it, it makes sense for them to have something in their pocket.
2980060	2981140	You know what I think happened?
2982140	2987260	Um, because a lot of folks are saying this is a response to Microsoft buying Activision.
2987300	2989420	No, no.
2989420	3005900	First off, if you're, if you're, um, if you're a gaming analyst or gaming commentator has come to that conclusion, that ought to be one of those red flag emojis because real talk, um, this conversation had to be in talks a long time ago.
3005940	3009580	So this started well before the news that Microsoft.
3010220	3016940	Now, you don't know who talks to who and maybe Sony picks some stuff, but I highly doubt any of that came into play.
3016980	3018900	This was something that happened independent of that.
3019220	3023740	It is simply interesting that Bungie was a Microsoft company.
3024020	3024860	Then they weren't.
3025180	3026980	Then they were an Activision company.
3027220	3028100	Then they weren't.
3028100	3032980	And they after the Activision thing, they were like, we're never getting into another relationship.
3032980	3037820	And, you know, if Bobby Kotick was your CEO, fuck, I'd be pretty scarred, too.
3038140	3041020	But now here we are, they're getting into a relationship again with Sony.
3041220	3042620	That is interesting.
3042660	3048140	Their trajectory, but, um, and it certainly has nothing to do with the Mike Microsoft Activision thing.
3048620	3052060	Yeah, these are, these are Ms says it's had to be in the works for at least six months.
3052660	3053220	Exactly.
3053220	3053620	Exactly.
3053860	3057900	And it's possible too, that it still could have been somewhat in response with that.
3057900	3061580	Cause you know, you don't know who was talking to Activision to purchase them.
3061820	3066380	Maybe Sony and Microsoft knew that, you know, one had interest for the others or something like that.
3066620	3073100	So it could be possible that, you know, some of that cause sparked it, but no, it's not like, you know,
3073100	3078460	Microsoft purchased Activision and they're like, well, we got to go buy somebody let's buy a bungee.
3078660	3080300	Thankfully they didn't say Konami.
3080940	3081980	That's not worth the money.
3082300	3086340	Um, they would have gotten it significantly cheaper.
3087260	3088420	I'll take $1.
3088740	3092620	At least get the Silent Hill IP from the 99 cent store.
3092620	3093300	Jesus.
3093340	3094220	Oh gosh.
3094260	3098380	Off offer the offer to buy an NFT of the Silent Hill franchise with Konami.
3098380	3099340	Maybe they'll fall for it.
3099780	3101980	Um, actually, wait quickly though.
3101980	3116540	The, the one thing with, um, uh, bungee and Activision and all that, I think, uh, well, with PlayStation and why they bought bungee, I think, you know, because PlayStation does get to see things that bungee's working on before anyone else does.
3116740	3117460	And they get to see this.
3117660	3131860	I mean, there's confidentiality agreements, there's, you know, all sorts of things, but how do you think that like, okay, Sony secured the rights for an exclusive map to destiny when it first came out or destiny to, I don't remember which one of those, I got the exclusive map for.
3131860	3140260	They had that whole thing, you know, so they they've had a relationship with bungee for a bit and they get to see these games months in advance to plan that marketing thing.
3140260	3141340	And, oh, we're going to invest these dollars.
3141580	3149860	So my thought is Sony saw something, whatever's bungee's working on now, and they were like, we have to have this.
3150300	3163820	We don't want anyone else having this, but us, um, or this is something that makes sense with our Sony and PC platform, as I'll tell you, it's going to be PC as well, but it'll be a Sony and PC type of title.
3164020	3165740	Uh, it makes sense with their strategy.
3165980	3168780	So I think that is why Sony bought bungee.
3169780	3174180	Oh, you want to, you want to know another red flag for your, uh, video game commentators?
3174180	3176060	I'm just going to tell it like it is an analyst.
3176460	3188260	If the next question that they're debating on their articles, their podcast or whatever is who's Nintendo going to buy red flag, emoji, red flag, emoji, not flag emoji.
3188260	3189660	I haven't heard of that studio.
3191380	3193180	Did we should totally start that studio?
3193500	3194580	It's right.
3194980	3195380	Right.
3195700	3200260	Uh, Nintendo, Nintendo is not rule number one.
3200260	3207900	And a thing you should come to realize a long time ago, Nintendo doesn't play the same game as the others in the room.
3208980	3222420	And also, why would Nintendo need to buy a studio to make more exclusive games when nobody is making exclusive games as good as Nintendo?
3222940	3226420	Some people are going to take issue with what I just said, but I fucking said it.
3227260	3229620	Nintendo is making the exclusives.
3229980	3234380	That's why everybody always goes, where, where, why won't Sony buy Nintendo?
3234380	3237740	Where, where, why can't we have Pokemon legends on PlayStation five?
3237740	3244820	Where, where, because, because Nintendo is making the games y'all want to play.
3245180	3248900	And that's the, it's that, that's the fact they don't need to buy a studio to make games.
3248900	3250580	They've got studios to make games.
3250820	3256380	They're only going to buy the things that make sense with their French vanilla fantasies.
3256820	3258580	That's, that's, that's it.
3258820	3265820	They're only going to buy the studios that are already marching in tandem with them and already kind of pretty much a part of the family and so forth.
3265980	3268540	They're not, Nintendo ain't fucking buying Sega.
3269180	3270660	They're not going to buy Konami.
3270660	3274580	They're not, Nintendo is just going to keep making Nintendo games.
3275580	3276980	So that's it.
3276980	3281780	Yeah, orange right in chat says Nintendo does what Nintendo does.
3282420	3283820	Yes, that.
3285660	3291260	Tiger Claw says Nintendo owns a couple studios of their own that develop only on their platform.
3291420	3294540	Tiger Claw points out Retro Studios, the Pokemon company to name a few.
3294660	3301540	Yes, companies that worked with them for a while on titles and were already kind of making games for Nintendo.
3301540	3310340	And it just made sense to be in, Hal Laboratories is another, there you go, that just makes sense to be in lockstep with them and where those acquisitions make sense.
3310540	3315700	Nintendo fucking coming out of left field and plunking down a bunch of cash for Sega, not Nintendo's game.
3315700	3323620	So I'm just, I'm just saying I would be, I mean, fuck, it's 2022 and we've all lived in this pandemic era.
3324020	3326020	Nothing should surprise us anymore.
3326020	3332180	So you know what, if I have to sit here and eat crow because Nintendo does end up buying someone big, then you know what?
3332180	3339740	Fuck it. Get me some ketchup because, uh, it would be certainly interesting, but I just, I think that's all it is, is a fan wank fantasy.
3339740	3343540	I don't think it's rooted in reality, but what is real anymore?
3344660	3346260	What is real anymore?
3348060	3351780	Anyway, uh, Loki, anything else you want to say with that story?
3351980	3353380	No, that's it really.
3354340	3356380	What do you think about the whole thing, Loki?
3356380	3358660	Do you think this is a good route for Sony?
3359500	3359940	Sure.
3359940	3360460	Why not?
3360460	3366260	Cause I'm not a big fan of Destiny, so I don't really care, but cool.
3366340	3369140	I mean, I'd be curious to see what they develop next.
3369140	3370300	Probably Destiny 3.
3370980	3372340	That's how it works nowadays.
3373060	3376580	I like Destiny on paper more than I do actually playing it.
3376580	3379220	And that is simply because I'm not great at shooters.
3379220	3380260	That's, that's really it.
3380260	3381300	That's the end all be all.
3381300	3383460	But I, I like what it is otherwise.
3383460	3387180	And I've spent time, I actually, that was a game I played on Stadia for a
3387180	3390300	bit when I was kind of evaluating and I actually, cause I was like, Oh, I
3390300	3393700	get to play on my PC as opposed to trying to play it on, you know, Xbox
3393700	3396500	or something with a controller and get to use my mouse and keyboard.
3396500	3400460	And it actually, it actually, I enjoyed playing it on, uh, that system.
3400460	3402340	So, uh, yeah, there is that.
3402780	3404100	So, all right.
3404380	3409460	Um, let's move on to another story about Sony and about the PlayStation
3409500	3413820	five and, uh, how they're not selling quite as many of them as they thought
3413820	3415300	they would, but it's not their fault.
3416020	3417140	It's the chip shortage.
3417220	3418380	It's the chip shortage.
3418540	3423700	It's, you know, it's that thing that's been blamed for everything.
3424180	3428260	Um, eh, Sony did the quarterly financial earnings report as these
3428260	3429540	large companies tend to do.
3429540	3432580	And they did point out there was a rise in profit in the gaming decision
3432940	3437740	division, excuse me, but Sony did lower the full year PlayStation five
3437740	3442980	sales forecast from 14.8 million to 11.5 million.
3442980	3444380	That is a fiscal year forecast.
3444380	3446060	So that means it ends on March 31st.
3446060	3447380	That's the year they're talking about.
3447700	3452020	Um, now of course, according to the chief financial officer at Sony, uh,
3452020	3457380	Hiroke Totoke, uh, the, uh, we can't say exactly for sure what
3457380	3458900	the demand is for next year.
3459220	3464860	Um, sorry, that's not part of the quote, but basically that, um, no, that
3464860	3467140	what I read is, sorry, I thought this next part was, I was about to read,
3467140	3471620	but, uh, in, in short, basically, uh, chip production and all that is,
3471620	3475180	has been affected by the ongoing chip shortages around the world.
3475180	3479820	So, uh, yeah, uh, Sony's trying to get more PlayStation fives, but these
3479820	3482500	chip shortages are going to continue for the time being, which again, if
3482500	3486460	you're paying to paying attention to anything in electronics, cars, the
3486460	3490940	refrigerator, Alan and I are trying to buy, uh, any of this stuff, it's,
3490980	3492500	it all plays in any of this.
3492580	3496780	Um, Intel has actually said the semiconductor shortages
3496780	3498500	can continue into 2023.
3499820	3505380	Um, Nintendo has also slashed a switch production and said a 20% decrease
3505380	3510460	in availability as has X-Box talked about this, uh, basically saying,
3510460	3513460	um, interesting though, when Phil Spencer talked about it, he said,
3513580	3517260	I think it's probably too isolated to talk about it as just a chip problem.
3517460	3520380	When I think about what does it mean to get the parts necessary to build a
3520380	3524220	console today and then get it to the markets where the demand is, there are
3524220	3527140	multiple kinds of pinch points in that process.
3527300	3528100	So it's interesting.
3528100	3529060	He's kind of called out.
3529060	3530780	There's other interesting things.
3530980	3534700	It's trying to get that boat through the Panama canal.
3534700	3537860	And then there's one boat that's making them all back up that causes
3537860	3540740	these consoles to, uh, not happen on time.
3540740	3542180	It's basically what it's coming down to.
3542260	3544300	So, yep.
3544980	3550220	Anyway, um, not terribly surprising to hear, but it is interesting when
3550220	3554300	you hear it resulted in the, uh, or you hear it reported in the company's
3554300	3558180	financial statements, basically it's, uh, yeah, I still don't have a PlayStation
3558180	3561940	five, but I'm hoping, I'm hoping, um, after this move settles down and now
3561940	3564900	you all know why I didn't indulge in the holidays, cause I've been saving
3564900	3568620	for this house stuff, but, um, after that all settles down, I'm hoping I will
3568620	3572540	finally get the PlayStation five, maybe over the summer, uh, if the finances
3572540	3576420	still look good, cause, uh, I don't want to miss Final Fantasy 16 if it comes
3576420	3577780	out this year, that's for sure.
3578260	3578980	So we'll see.
3580260	3582420	All right, moving on Dark Sakura.
3582860	3585620	Why, why talk about new consoles when we can talk about old ones?
3586780	3588140	Thanks for the spoiler, Rob.
3588140	3588700	Sorry.
3588700	3590380	It's on the sidebar for what it's worth.
3591100	3593740	Yeah, but I have my own intro set up for that.
3593980	3594580	Oh, my bad.
3594660	3600140	Anyway, um, I was going to say there's a new game coming on an old thing.
3601500	3608300	So, uh, well, the game is coming out on the Wii U in the eShop and it's going
3608300	3613940	to use the balance board, or at least it can use the balance board, but it is a,
3613980	3620620	um, a game called Silver Falls, white inside it's Umbra, it's a horror
3620620	3623780	game, uh, done by Sun Grand Studios.
3624140	3628820	Um, it will allow you to use the balance board for, uh, you know,
3628820	3630740	for movement if you want to.
3631220	3633140	Um, it looks pretty cool.
3633140	3638020	I mean, this is sort of what I always thought the Wii U would have been great
3638020	3644140	for, you know, I always wished that, um, that there'd been other games that had
3644140	3649580	such deep integration with, uh, with the, the game pad, you know, so that you
3649580	3653460	could see more stuff on there or use it to solve your puzzles or make it a
3653460	3654900	camera or something.
3655380	3656980	Um, but it looks pretty cool.
3656980	3662300	I mean, I don't know if it's worth me busting out wherever I put my Wii U to
3662300	3664300	play, but Hey, it could be fun.
3664900	3667220	And I like, I like kind of scary games.
3667260	3671300	So, yeah, I think that's a good question.
3671300	3674340	You bring up those, how many people still have their Wii U hooked up?
3674620	3677380	Cause I don't, I don't even have a Wii U anymore.
3677420	3677900	Yeah, I know.
3677900	3680060	I think a lot of people, I mean, I'm sure there's some, like if I pulled
3680060	3682340	the chat, there'd be a couple of people that are like, Oh, I still have it.
3682340	3682780	I still have it.
3682980	3685860	I mean, how many of you actually still have a hooked up to your TV, ready
3685860	3687340	to power on in a moment's notice?
3687620	3689740	Cause I still have my Wii U it's just in a box.
3690780	3695060	Ours was actually until like mid last year when we loaned it to Julian.
3695220	3695660	Hmm.
3696620	3698740	So, okay.
3698740	3700620	There's a couple of people, it's about half and half.
3700620	3703940	Some say I do some say I have it, but it's not hooked up or mine's in store.
3703940	3706540	We busted out from time to time for certain games.
3706540	3709660	Like Dan and I had talked about trying to dig it out to play Shantae.
3710140	3711340	So, okay.
3713500	3713780	Yeah.
3713780	3717300	And especially I think anybody with a passing retro interest, I mean, a, the
3717300	3721700	virtual console is more expansive on the Wii U there's that and be, you know, just
3721700	3724860	people that are retro console console enthusiasts are going to tend to have
3724860	3728540	more systems set up readily accessible when they get the urge to play something
3728540	3732260	retro, which, you know, the Wii U kind of fits in that category now as a retro
3732260	3735340	console, they, I know it's weird to think about, but it kind of is at this point.
3735820	3737940	Um, when did the Wii U release?
3737940	3738940	Was it 20?
3739740	3740700	Was it 2012?
3741380	3742620	Are we hitting the 10 year point?
3742620	3743380	No, no, no.
3743420	3745580	Cause it was, it was after I started my new job.
3745580	3750060	So that would have been after 2014 and he was like 2015 or something.
3750100	3751180	Was it really that?
3751220	3751500	I guess.
3751500	3751900	Oh, wow.
3751900	3755540	Maybe it was Bob Coffees is 2013 was the year.
3755540	3756020	2013.
3756060	3757540	Oh, I might've gotten a little bit late.
3757820	3758140	Yeah.
3759060	3759460	All right.
3760020	3760420	Anyway.
3760660	3762100	Uh, let's move on Loki.
3763180	3767180	So speaking of Nintendo consoles and, you know, sales and stuff, you know, the
3767180	3773700	switch it's doing well, it's outsold the Nintendo Wii something that, you know, we
3773700	3776940	thought that might not actually be possible, but yes, apparently it is quite
3776940	3777780	possible to do that.
3778340	3780700	So, um, not bad.
3781700	3786860	Uh, I'm curious to see a word ends up leaving off at the end.
3786860	3790820	I mean, cause I mean, if it's already outsold the Wii and it's only been out a
3790820	3799260	few years, um, it's going to be interesting to see, but, um, yeah, 103
3799420	3805020	million or 103.5 million units sold since the end of the year.
3806340	3807300	So pretty good.
3807660	3808740	Yeah, not bad.
3808740	3813220	I'm curious, we'll probably get an updated number to that around March.
3813220	3813780	I'm guessing.
3813780	3815740	Cause that's usually the end of the financial year.
3816220	3820780	So we'll have to wait and see, you know, a good point that, um, Jason, our, our
3820780	3825540	voiceover guy brought up is that, um, part of the reason probably why you see
3825540	3827380	this number is as high as it is.
3827380	3830460	I mean, it's, it's a great console and you know, there's good games on it.
3830460	3833580	And of course all that's very important and we shouldn't neglect any of that.
3834340	3840060	But, um, when the Wii was out, you also still had the Nintendo DS and the 3DS
3840060	3842980	that was capturing that part of the handheld market and Nintendo has
3842980	3845740	essentially consolidated their two markets.
3845780	3851420	So the Wii does not exist separately as the DS and 3DS as a platform.
3851660	3855100	Nintendo has gone from two platforms to one platform that does both.
3855300	3858180	And so that's also a big part of this as well is that that number really
3858180	3862300	reflects handheld and, you know, uh, console.
3863140	3863820	I'm surprised.
3863820	3869380	So like the top selling game is Mario Kart eight deluxe, which is that 43.35
3869380	3873860	million units, but like you would think like Mario Odyssey would be up there.
3873900	3875700	It's only 23 million.
3875940	3880700	And then even like say, you know, breath of the wild is 25 million.
3881180	3883220	So I'm kind of surprised that those are so low.
3884060	3887140	I am as well, but it's very, it's very, that's a Wii U game.
3887740	3890940	Uh, well, I, I think that's actually not a factor anymore
3890980	3892140	that it was a Wii U game.
3892140	3895180	I think that, you know, nobody bought the Wii U.
3895180	3897900	I know I'm making a broad stroke there.
3897900	3898380	Sorry.
3898380	3901380	Especially to everybody in chat that just said, my Wii U is still hooked up.
3901660	3904060	I think the reality is nobody bought the Wii U.
3904300	3909700	Uh, and so, um, you know, when we talk about these big numbers and so I think
3909700	3912740	that part isn't as much, and I think what it is, it's just, it's just that thing
3912740	3917580	that Mario Kart is that easy multiplayer party game that people want to own so
3917580	3921660	that they have like the party game for people to play or people come over and
3921660	3924740	there's game night and I think Mario Kart is just like that thing that's in
3924740	3928820	our culture that so many people know now, you know, that it's just, I think that's
3928820	3933460	why it even outsells a brilliant title like breath of the wild where I don't
3933460	3935700	think there's as many people that are, cause you know, if you want to play
3935700	3939300	breath of the wild, you're going to have to sit down and game, you're going to,
3939340	3942460	you know, spend some time with breath of the wild and not everybody approaches
3942460	3945820	their video games like that where they're playing for hours and hours at a time.
3945820	3949300	Some people just want to be able to play Mario Kart, uh, before or after
3949300	3950500	the game that's on television.
3950940	3952780	I think that's a big part of it.
3953140	3957740	Uh, what it is, um, Bob coffee and chat says Mario Kart, deluxe is evergreen.
3957940	3960100	Tons of normies buy it every day.
3960140	3960780	Exactly.
3960780	3962820	It's normies muggles, I guess.
3963100	3968820	Although I don't, I don't love using words in her environment, but, um, muggle,
3968900	3974380	muggles always a way I've explained non-gamers, um, dark Tetsuya said, I mean,
3974380	3977660	I thought that we, you was all right, but consider I have like a dozen Wii U games
3977660	3978860	compared to over two dozen on switch.
3979100	3983740	Yeah, me, me saying no one bought the Wii U does not suddenly make it a bad console
3983740	3985060	or all the games on it were bad.
3985220	3986140	I owned a Wii U.
3986180	3986940	I thought it was great.
3986940	3990580	And there was a lot of games on it I really liked and I think EA really fucked
3990580	3992700	them, but that's, that's a whole other story.
3992700	3996140	I think Nintendo did do some misfires with the Wii U and the number one
3996140	3997580	misfire was the name.
3998180	4000180	Um, but that's old news at this point.
4000300	4004780	Uh, the reality is, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's passed away.
4005100	4008700	Uh, and now the switch is the new person in town and that's, uh, that's
4008700	4009260	what it is.
4009300	4012780	So, uh, E3VL says casuals.
4012780	4013940	Yes, there is that as well.
4015100	4018940	Uh, moving on, uh, you know, what casuals love is Pokemon.
4018940	4021260	And this is some very welcome news.
4021260	4026100	I think for a lot of people, um, especially after, remember last week we
4026100	4030300	had that news story about there was a YouTube channel with all this Nintendo
4030300	4031980	music that got shut down.
4032220	4036060	And, you know, I think our response to that was, boy, it would be great if
4036060	4039460	Nintendo would have like a fucking player of their own somewhere where you
4039460	4043660	could play the music and sure folks pointed out, oh, they're super smash
4043660	4047900	brothers, but even that is, you know, that's embedded within another game.
4047900	4050980	And it's not something that really, you know, it's not like a library online
4050980	4052420	you can access and all this stuff.
4052820	4055100	Well, this makes the news this week.
4055140	4062220	Very interesting that Pokemon diamond and Pokemon Pearl audio are now available
4062220	4064900	for use in personal projects.
4064940	4069420	That is way off the course of what we would expect for Nintendo, right?
4069420	4073140	Now, granted, this is the Pokemon company and it's technically separate, but
4073660	4075420	obviously there's a relationship there, right?
4075740	4080500	So the Pokemon company launched the DP sound library.
4080860	4083260	DP stands for diamond Pearl.
4083260	4086180	I just want to make that very clear about Pokemon diamond Pearl.
4086420	4089700	You can use audio from, uh, Pokemon diamond and Pokemon
4089700	4091620	Pearl in your personal projects.
4092460	4096820	You can put sound effects in there in like a social media video, like a YouTube
4096820	4101580	or Twitch, you could, if, if Bobby Black Wolf wanted to take out his overclocked
4101580	4106260	music breaks and use Pokemon DP library, he could, I don't think he will.
4106260	4111140	Cause we still love overclocked here, but that is something that could be available
4111140	4112740	here on Twitch and what have you.
4113060	4116940	Um, also background music is allowed for non-commercial
4116940	4118580	event or personal websites.
4118620	4122580	So in other words, you can't exactly like put it in a movie and sell the movie.
4122580	4126900	I imagine though, you could probably play it at a convention and get away with it,
4126900	4129460	even though that's kind of more of a gray area, but I digress.
4129860	4132460	You can also download the music to use.
4132740	4136700	Uh, you can stream the music if you just want some online radio type of stuff.
4137060	4137900	It's all there.
4138260	4145180	Um, now, uh, there are of course bands on commercial uses, so no remix album to
4145180	4147820	sell, you can't put them in your own game.
4147860	4150900	No broadcast TV or radio or any of that.
4151100	4152860	You cannot use the media.
4152860	4153900	I think this is interesting.
4154060	4159060	You cannot use the media and anything that makes specific, ideological,
4159380	4162540	religious, or political claims.
4163140	4163580	Sorry.
4163580	4167140	I'm laughing because I thought of something a streamer did last night and I'm
4167140	4171140	going to, I'm going to warn Alan's in the kitchen, laughing too.
4175660	4175900	Sorry.
4176660	4178020	I can't no COVID Mon.
4178060	4181380	No, Alan in the other room went, you know who also caught them all?
4181740	4182460	Jesus.
4184300	4185940	But here's the thing.
4186260	4186700	Okay.
4187140	4190220	So there was, so you would not, you would not be able to use this in your stream.
4190220	4191980	So it was actually, it was actually losing color.
4192180	4196740	Was I, I'm just going to, I'm going to warn, I'm going to warn this could ruffle
4196740	4201180	some feathers, but I, I think if you just look at his humor and don't read too much
4201180	4203100	into it, it's actually kind of funny.
4203620	4206900	Was doing one of those postgame chats with people and was just like, you know,
4206900	4210740	typing or like I remember he was doing this whole thing as a, and then at the
4210740	4217220	very, very end just put, Oh, and by the way, enter, God doesn't exist left.
4219100	4222700	And I don't know why, but like Alan and I thought that was like the funniest troll.
4222700	4225420	Like we were watching on the TV in our bedroom.
4225420	4227180	We just start dying laughing.
4228300	4230620	Oh, the player's name was God's warrior.
4230620	4231100	I didn't even.
4231300	4232780	Oh, that was it.
4233340	4234900	I didn't even see that.
4234900	4237660	Oh, I just thought he randomly pulled that out of thin air.
4237660	4239580	Just wanted to let you know, God doesn't exist.
4239580	4240140	Good night.
4240140	4241900	And I just started laughing.
4242460	4248460	The other one that cracked me up, that was like, like something AR 14 or whatever.
4249860	4252620	And then I made some sort of comment about that too.
4252620	4253980	And I, I forgot anyway.
4254180	4260340	So anyway, my point is probably would not want to use Pokemon DP music during that.
4261260	4267780	So if you're trying to make a, a religious or what have you a type of thing, a lot of
4267780	4272820	people noticing this comes right off the heels, off the youth, after the YouTube
4272820	4276180	channel gets shut down, of course, this isn't Nintendo that did this.
4276180	4279300	It's the Pokemon company, but still hard to ignore.
4279500	4284340	And I think a lot of people are looking at this going, please, Pokemon company, please,
4284340	4291140	please, will you go talk to your daddy Nintendo and tell him what a good idea this
4291140	4294100	is and how Nintendo should do this?
4294220	4299460	I mean, how many of you are just sitting here foaming at the mouth, salivating that
4299460	4300660	Nintendo do this?
4301020	4301860	I know I am.
4302020	4310060	Can you, can you fucking imagine if Nintendo actually said, actually said, you can use
4310060	4311980	our music and your streams royalty free.
4312020	4312500	Enjoy.
4313500	4316740	You would never hear it already treated like they do that anyway.
4316740	4320420	So I don't understand what the difference would be, but it's a gray area now.
4321300	4325860	I guess so, but people already use it carte blanche, so why not?
4327700	4329340	It would just be, I just be phenomenal.
4329340	4333340	Anyway, I hope this isn't the last, I have a feeling this might be a test of sorts.
4333580	4335100	We'll see how that all plays out.
4335100	4340100	But, um, I'm, I'm really hoping it's not the last that we see of this sort of thing.
4340340	4344460	Maybe we'll see more Pokemon music make its way into this sort of format or something.
4344660	4346060	Uh, I think that would be really great.
4346260	4350900	So, uh, Bob Coffey says at the very least, Nintendo should put their stuff on CD here
4351180	4356260	or like the streaming services, Apple music, Spotify, Tidal, pick one of them,
4356260	4356860	pick all of them.
4356860	4357580	I don't give a shit.
4357580	4362340	Just get the music out there to a place we can actually, you know, stream it very
4362340	4364220	easily, but meh.
4365420	4365780	All right.
4365780	4366260	Moving on.
4366820	4367140	Yeah.
4370180	4375340	Well, um, Epic has filed a trademark for Epic Games, Megaverse.
4376100	4381780	Um, they are, they filed it at the end of 2021 and it's supposed to cover a wide
4381780	4389220	range of goods and services and be a new umbrella for their big overall universe
4389220	4390020	that they want to do.
4390460	4397340	Uh, they're sort of putting it out there as sort of a 3D virtual space to play
4397340	4399620	and work and people hang out, I guess.
4399940	4400460	Sort of like a mobile-
4400460	4402380	Can they just finish their storefront, please?
4402780	4404540	And stop all this nonsense.
4405420	4412580	It's supposed to be a, as some sort of like mobile conversational service.
4413420	4419180	So, but I mean, is this like their version of Play?
4420140	4420540	Is it?
4420860	4424860	It sounds like their version of the Metaverse, like Facebook's, you want to
4424860	4426740	talk about VR 90s shit?
4426740	4427300	Look at that.
4427300	4430900	Look at that stuff that Facebook's trying to pull us with, with the Metaverse.
4431140	4432740	That's what this sounds like to me.
4433460	4438140	But like, I'm sorry, in the Metaverse, I don't want to have a me anymore.
4438140	4439540	I think we've moved beyond that.
4439580	4442900	Well, Epic's games, Megaverse have a shopping cart available.
4444580	4447460	I swear to God, we're going to start our own Metaverse, you know, type thing.
4447460	4449980	It's like, you can't even finish the storefront.
4450380	4452500	Don't, don't start talking to me.
4452660	4456660	If Steam wants to start off their own Metaverse thing, by all means, they
4456660	4457940	can go ahead and talk about that.
4457940	4460020	Cause they, at least they have a functioning storefront.
4460100	4464780	I, I'm going to say Steam kind of has the opposite problem is that Steam tries to
4464780	4467860	put their pause in too many things and then doesn't do anything with it.
4467860	4472100	And I think the case in point is their whole, do you know, Steam has a broadcast,
4472100	4474460	like a Twitch competitor built into Steam?
4474820	4476420	Where was the last, yeah, exactly.
4476580	4478820	When was the last time anyone thought about that?
4479980	4482980	That Steam has a competitor to Twitch built into Steam.
4483580	4487540	I, I think every time I go there, it's a lot of Russian streams.
4487580	4490580	So maybe, and maybe that's also Dota 2's popularity over there.
4490660	4493060	Um, I don't, so it may be a combination of those things.
4493060	4496460	Maybe it's just more popular in other countries than it is here, but it's just,
4496580	4499300	it's one of those things where I'm always like, Steam just kind of like
4499300	4501300	builds it and then lets it get moldy.
4501860	4503860	Like, it's just like, it's weird.
4506500	4506980	Anyway.
4508500	4511060	But I guess good luck to Epic Games and the Megaverse.
4511060	4514420	But, uh, it's just one of those things where it's like, I kind of agree with
4514420	4517700	Loki is that it's, it's weird that they're even talking about this when
4517700	4519940	their storefront is still as bad as it is.
4519940	4522500	There's like so much cart before the horse type stuff.
4522500	4526660	Like first off, like the metaverse stuff that they're talking about is like
4526660	4530500	white, white, it's to satisfy investors.
4530540	4534580	It's to satisfy investors, but I wish investors could see right through this.
4534900	4537300	It feels like the investors don't use any of the products.
4537780	4538420	Exactly.
4538420	4541700	Cause like you're talking about, like the metaverse stuff, like let's okay.
4541860	4544180	It's like basically ready player one kind of nonsense.
4544500	4548180	You have to talk about wide adoption of VR, which I'm all for.
4548180	4550020	Like, I really hope we get to that point.
4550180	4551860	We are nowhere near that point.
4552180	4555460	And then on top of that, your vision of it looks stupid.
4555780	4558020	I don't want that, that vision of it.
4558020	4560820	Like I would rather do the stuff that they were talking about, like with
4560820	4562580	HoloLens, that seems a lot cooler.
4562900	4563780	I mean, I just.
4565460	4566020	I got it.
4566980	4567620	I got it.
4567620	4569620	Like it's, it's, it's all about, yeah.
4569620	4570820	It's all about investors.
4570820	4573620	And like you say a buzz, you know, phrase.
4573620	4576260	It's like, that's why I knew everyone's getting in the NFTs.
4576260	4578500	It's just because, Ooh, money NFTs.
4578500	4579780	I liked NFT.
4579780	4580740	I'll give you money now.
4580740	4583140	It's like, Oh, I've got it.
4583140	4583700	I've got it.
4584740	4587300	I'm going to say something and you're going to hate me.
4587860	4590500	And if you already hate me, you're going to hate me more.
4591300	4591800	Ready?
4592760	4601400	What if Sony bought Bungie to help them make the Sony metaverse home 2.0 and
4601400	4603320	always online experience in gaming.
4605400	4608920	I don't actually, I don't actually think that, but I wanted to speak it
4608920	4612360	into existence just to make everybody, uh, bang their head against the
4612360	4613640	nearest flat surface.
4613640	4614200	You're welcome.
4614200	4615080	They would never do that.
4618280	4619880	Deetra Rama S in chat says get out.
4619880	4620520	Home was pretty good.
4620520	4623640	I mean, that's a lot closer than say, you know, what, what they're doing
4623640	4625800	with like meta and stuff.
4625800	4626200	I'm sorry.
4626200	4629720	I'm not going to call them that anymore with Facebook's like idea of the, the
4629720	4635480	metaverse thing, Facebook's being a butthole, which is just a big old rip
4635480	4636360	off of ready player one.
4636360	4636760	Anyways.
4636760	4640120	I mean, honestly, have you heard the latest with Facebook where now they're
4640120	4643160	threatening to pull out of Europe because Europe won't let them violate
4643160	4647480	privacy and sell the information to U S the company that you want to have.
4647480	4652600	Like they do, they do understand that they're the IOI of this, you know,
4652600	4654520	ready player one story.
4654520	4656200	I mean, they're not the good company.
4656200	4659480	They're the company that you distrust in like are the evil company.
4660040	4663640	So I don't care if they're going to try to bring it to the world.
4663640	4666520	It's just, no, it will never work.
4666520	4669640	E3 VL in chat says PS home was ahead of its time.
4669640	4671640	Just the load times and download was horrible.
4671640	4672200	You know what?
4673800	4674440	You know what?
4674440	4675080	Yes.
4675080	4678680	I, you know, and I I've given PlayStation home a fair amount of shit on this show.
4679400	4684200	Where, who is the guy that used to, um, really evangelize PlayStation home here?
4684200	4685640	He used to come in on Sunday nights.
4685640	4688840	He used to talk up home and all the good that I, where, where is that?
4688840	4691560	I know he rage quit and stopped listening at some point ago.
4691560	4692200	Where is that?
4692200	4693800	I want to apologize to that guy.
4693800	4697240	I, cause I think, I think he was onto something.
4697240	4698120	It's just a bummer.
4698120	4702200	Sony didn't just stick with it a little while longer.
4702200	4706680	And I think, I think maybe the PlayStation three wasn't the right place for it.
4706680	4711560	I think the PlayStation four might've been able to handle a little more what they wanted it to do,
4711560	4715400	where it was, um, you know, the, the trophies were actually things that you had
4715400	4716440	and all of that stuff.
4716440	4719720	Like Sony could have had this a long time ago.
4719720	4720600	It's a real bummer.
4721240	4721960	Could have should have.
4721960	4722200	Yeah.
4722200	4723480	Could have should have would have.
4723480	4723980	All right.
4724920	4725420	Anyway.
4725880	4730280	Um, as 200 Matt says, yeah, PlayStation home was ahead of its time.
4730280	4731640	Same with game room.
4731640	4733880	Same with one versus a hundred, just to touch it.
4733880	4737560	Well, if I can continue with what I was going to say in my story, I guess.
4737560	4738060	Yeah.
4738600	4739100	Okay.
4739400	4745160	Um, they're claiming that the investment is going to, and this is a quote, accelerate the
4745160	4749800	work around building connected social experiences in Fortnite Rocket League and Fall Guys.
4750360	4756840	And also, you know, helping, uh, you know, developers and other creators use Unreal
4756840	4761960	Engine and the Epic, uh, services and their online store and stuff like that.
4761960	4769560	So it's, I think it's meant to drive content and communication.
4769560	4775160	So it also sounds to me that Epic games is saying the mega verse is just Fortnite.
4777400	4778440	No rocket league.
4778440	4779480	And this is one.
4779480	4781080	No, they absolutely do.
4781080	4785000	But isn't it even better if Epic can tie all that into Fortnite?
4785640	4790280	I, I, I feel like it's just, it's just be a, such a thing for them to do anyway.
4791640	4792520	All right.
4792520	4794840	Um, moving on, I think we're over to Loki.
4795960	4796760	Yeah.
4796760	4803720	So like the everybody's been asking, Hey, Rockstar, when are you going to make Grand Theft Auto six?
4803720	4806600	Except I haven't been asking that cause I just don't care anymore.
4806600	4807480	I made you care, right?
4807480	4808680	Just, I'm not going to ask about it.
4809480	4815400	So they finally have decided to publish a statement on it and saying that, Hey, with
4815400	4820280	unprecedented longevity of Grand Theft Auto five, we know many of you have been asking about a new
4820280	4821880	entry in the Grand Theft Auto series.
4821880	4824840	Yeah, because it's been over almost 10 years now.
4824840	4830920	Um, and with every new project we embark on, our goal is the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4830920	4831560	Okay.
4831560	4837720	So basically they're, they're looking to push, you know, the boundaries of gaming and whatnot,
4837720	4841880	and that their next entry is going to be, is in active development.
4841880	4844520	And they're looking to push those boundaries as well.
4846440	4850520	So yes, in development, who knows when the hell it's coming out?
4851720	4854120	Well, it's been in development since like Red Dead Redemption two.
4854120	4855560	So I mean, like, I don't know.
4855560	4861560	I was going to say the fact that they're working on a Grand Theft Auto six should surprise nobody.
4862120	4863320	No, it's not a surprise.
4864280	4867880	But it's just interesting to hear them acknowledge it for a change.
4867880	4870680	You know, like, Oh yes, that super obvious thing.
4870680	4872840	And they're the big, big elephant in the room.
4872840	4873320	Here it is.
4873320	4875640	And also on top of that, though, like, I don't like,
4876360	4879080	I'm not giving them the benefit of the doubt here.
4879080	4880840	Like, I need to see this game.
4882200	4886120	You know, I can't throw trust into companies anymore.
4886120	4889800	Like, especially with some of the stuff that they've tried to pull with certain games.
4889800	4891640	They make quality games, yes.
4891640	4895080	But they also can kind of rush to get things done.
4895720	4897400	Yeah, I'm excited about it.
4897400	4901320	Assuming that the online or that the single player campaign's good,
4901320	4903560	because that's really all I'm interested in online.
4904600	4905480	Yeah, not for me.
4907480	4911400	LM Orchard in our chat says GTA six in the metaverse.
4912040	4914360	Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna need you to come.
4914360	4918280	Come put your face close to your mobile device or monitor screen.
4918280	4920760	Come come put your face close to it so I can slap you.
4920760	4921160	Come here.
4921160	4921480	Come here.
4922680	4923000	Come here.
4923000	4925000	They're not doing that in the metaverse.
4925000	4926200	And they already have, was it?
4926200	4928920	They announced that they're doing San Andreas, remember?
4928920	4935080	And probably about the same company that did the remaster do the VR version.
4935080	4936280	So good luck with that.
4936280	4937480	That's going to be a horror show.
4939400	4940440	But you know, I'm all down.
4940440	4942840	I'm down to see it whenever the hell that comes out.
4943720	4949720	All right, look, enough enough metaverse, enough VR, AR, enough of that.
4949720	4955160	Why don't we why don't we talk about a company that likes to make retro inspired things?
4955160	4959960	Let's talk about Yacht Club Games and their latest project, which they unveiled this week.
4959960	4963720	It's called Mina the Hollower is the name of it.
4963720	4968200	It's a 60 frame a second, and they're calling it a Game Boy Color homage.
4969080	4972280	But I don't know if it looks Game Boy Color to me.
4972280	4972840	I guess so.
4972840	4977960	It just looks more of a product of that era, like Shovel Knight was and so forth.
4978520	4980760	But yeah, they're making it run at 60 frames a second.
4980760	4984840	It's a top down adventure game full of mystery and horror.
4984840	4989880	They're saying Link's Awakening meets Castlevania with a sprinkle of Dark Souls.
4989880	4991480	Why does everything have to be Dark Souls?
4991480	4994920	Whatever to me, it's going to be because it's hard.
4994920	4996360	Doesn't mean it's Dark Souls.
4996360	5000280	I saw Star Tropics, but Gothic, that's what I saw in it.
5000280	5003640	But I guess there's similarities to all those topics.
5006120	5009480	Loki, I'm going to need you to put your face really close to the TV, please.
5009480	5010520	We're going to need to time you out.
5013960	5015800	Someone attempt ban Loki.
5015800	5018520	Anyway, time out, Loki, 60 seconds.
5018520	5024280	All right, the game is currently in production and all this stuff.
5024280	5027960	And if you want to get on the game now, you can go to Kickstarter.
5028840	5030200	That's kind of interesting.
5031160	5035400	But it's one of those things where, like, because, you know, I've been very nervous
5035400	5036280	about backing.
5036280	5041160	I really haven't done one in a long time, and I'm probably not going to because just
5041160	5044040	there's been too many projects on Kickstarter that don't deliver.
5044040	5046280	And that's the reality from my perspective.
5047400	5053000	But I also understand where Yacht Club Games, who found that success for Shovel Knight,
5053000	5057000	which truly was one of the great Kickstarter success stories.
5057000	5060840	I can understand why they're going back to their roots a little bit with this.
5060840	5062840	I fully expect this game will come out.
5062840	5067240	I mean, the trailer was pretty outstanding and shows that the game is far enough along
5067240	5068120	in development.
5068120	5071240	And I mean, shit, they've already blown through their goal.
5071240	5073800	They were only trying to raise $311,000.
5073800	5075960	They've already hit $703,000.
5075960	5077400	They're well past their goal.
5077400	5078600	The game will happen.
5078600	5080520	It's just, you know, how many stretch goals are they going to hit?
5081800	5084680	But it is on Kickstarter.
5084680	5088040	So they're up to, oh, this might interest you, DarkSakura.
5088040	5092760	The next stretch goal at $800,000, which I'm sure they'll hit because there are 22 days
5092760	5098520	left in this, is the Mac and Linux port of the game will be the $800,000 goal.
5098520	5102440	They've already reached sound test, cheat codes, and new game plus.
5103080	5107400	So Mac and Linux port is up next for me.
5109400	5112040	I did spend money on a Kickstarter.
5112120	5114920	Oh, yeah.
5114920	5117000	Somebody dropped that on my doorstep too.
5117000	5121560	Uh, which, um, you know, again, I just kind of feel the way I feel about Kickstarter.
5121560	5124360	So I didn't back it, but I'd be curious when that game comes out.
5126200	5126440	Yeah.
5127000	5130120	So anyway, what was the name of drag?
5130120	5131560	Her was the name of it or something like that, right?
5131560	5131720	Yeah.
5131720	5132200	Drag her.
5132200	5133480	It looks pretty funny.
5133480	5135480	It looks like everybody looks like Trixie Mattel.
5135480	5135980	Yeah.
5136760	5140040	Uh, and Mike Deaf points out the Kickstarter isn't to fund the game.
5140040	5144680	The Kickstarter is to fund future projects for the franchise, like merch and future spinoffs.
5144680	5147160	Well, but it does affect the game.
5147160	5151320	Like I know that was the line they're giving, but look, the stretch goal they're on Mac
5151320	5153720	and Linux port that directly relates new game.
5153720	5156120	Plus these are things that relate to the game.
5156120	5158360	So it's, I get it.
5158360	5158840	I get it.
5158840	5165000	But it, and when I do feel more comfortable about Kickstarters and to be clear is when
5165000	5169560	the Kickstarter is more to fund the publishing of the game, like I already have a finished
5169560	5177240	product, I just need to make the cartridges to put Pixel Poops 2 on to sell, you know,
5177240	5179000	the actual NES cartridges.
5179000	5181160	That's where Kickstarters make more sense to me.
5181160	5186120	So that way, you know, you're only funding as many of those as actually need to be made.
5186120	5188280	So that's, um, yeah.
5189480	5195880	Anyway, um, let's see, uh, as shown here, Matt says when yacht club games did the Kickstarter
5195880	5199880	campaign for Shovel Knight, they provided consistent and fully transparent updates.
5199880	5203720	So the community never felt it was ghosted and saw a lot of products.
5203720	5205160	Um, yeah.
5205160	5210520	So, uh, I think that's why this Kickstarter kind of feels a little bit different.
5210520	5211160	That's for sure.
5211960	5212360	All right.
5212360	5216040	Well, on a retro note, roll the bumper for the next segment.
5227160	5232680	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5232680	5235000	out a classic and tell you about it.
5235000	5237640	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5237640	5240600	All right.
5240600	5247480	But this time dark Sakura has a, uh, classic electronic handheld that she's going to be
5247480	5248920	sharing with us here.
5248920	5253080	Uh, so dark Sakura, what is the, uh, classic handheld?
5254280	5257160	It is, uh, Mattel electronics football.
5258120	5264680	And I'm talking about a old, uh, this was released in 1977.
5265240	5270040	There was, depending on which version was released, like there was a rerelease of it.
5270040	5273000	There was football or football one, cause there was a football two later.
5273640	5281000	Um, but it was basically, um, you had like little dots that represented the players and
5281000	5281960	everything.
5281960	5286360	Um, there were, it's a lot of differences between some of the different models too.
5286360	5293720	The, the font on the first edition of it was that sort of seventies looking digital looking
5293800	5294200	font.
5295240	5303000	Um, it also, uh, the early ones came with an AC adapter jack that was removed on later
5303000	5305080	models so that it would only run on battery.
5305800	5312920	Um, and, uh, you know, there were other changes that they made for other markets.
5312920	5319400	Um, but, uh, uh, some of them had like different, uh, stickers on the back.
5319400	5325400	Like one of them said, try fresh batteries written, uh, on a, the back of the, of the
5325400	5325800	machine.
5326360	5328760	Um, it was released in June, 1977.
5328760	5334680	It was the second game that was released by Mattel auto race was the first, it was sold
5334680	5335400	through Sears.
5336120	5342200	Um, they, uh, they had made less than a hundred thousand of them.
5342200	5347640	And then Sears, uh, said that they didn't think the game would be a big seller.
5348360	5353000	And so, uh, they stopped production on football and auto race.
5353000	5357000	And then in six months, uh, Sears was proven wrong.
5357000	5362200	So they started the production up again and, uh, sold quite a bit of them.
5362200	5369960	As many as 500,000, uh, units by a midweek, uh, sorry, by, uh, uh, selling that many a
5369960	5372360	week by mid February, 1978.
5373080	5377640	Um, so yeah, it's lippy blippy buttons.
5377640	5380520	And didn't they do a re-release of this?
5380520	5381880	I think, cause I think we have it.
5382680	5384840	Um, somebody in chat is asking about that teacher.
5384840	5386920	Um, S says, didn't they also re-release this?
5386920	5391400	And so you are probably on the right track and yeah, cause I know we have it somewhere.
5393800	5395400	I'm going to double check something real quick.
5396040	5396840	Yeah, sure.
5396840	5398360	Uh, getting some other comments in chat.
5398360	5401480	Um, dark Tatsuya says I've heard of it, but don't think I had one.
5401480	5404520	Uh, fifth dream says I played that once at a friend's house and I was little, though
5404520	5407800	I have no interest in football, but I had interest in electronic games.
5407800	5408600	Big same.
5408600	5411800	I played this, but it was because I thought electronics were cool.
5411800	5412280	Yeah.
5412280	5415640	It was re-released and you can get it for 150 bucks on Amazon.
5415640	5416520	Nice.
5416520	5417720	Uh, tiger cloud points out.
5417720	5420440	I had a cameo in guardians of the galaxy volume two.
5420440	5421000	Interesting.
5421000	5424280	That might also explain why they felt the need to reprint it at some point.
5424280	5428040	So, uh, fifth dream says the definition of beep boop.
5429000	5429500	Yes.
5430440	5435560	Well, and you can still pick up, you know, the original ones for pretty inexpensive,
5435560	5436920	like on eBay and whatnot.
5437480	5443160	Um, there's also a baseball, there was subchase that came out in 1978.
5443960	5449480	Um, you can even get like a little key chain version of, uh, of football.
5450440	5455080	It's like, it's like the world's smallest, you know, you know, or yeah, the world's
5455080	5457160	coolest or world's smallest edition or something.
5457720	5459720	And, uh, it actually works.
5459720	5464440	So, you know, you can still get in on that action.
5465240	5466280	They still take the same bat.
5466280	5470200	We've been using the same batteries for however many years it'll work.
5471000	5475160	Uh, Ella mortured in chat says I loved the seventies and eighties attempts at sports
5475160	5478200	games that had almost no resemblance to the actual sports.
5479640	5481000	Yeah, but electronics were cool.
5481000	5486600	So, and hence why we celebrate one every month here in 2022 with our classic electronic
5486600	5492760	handheld of the month and lots of bleeps and not to be confused with blinks and blunks.
5492760	5493160	Yes.
5493160	5495560	Uh, handheld electronic football.
5496280	5497080	A very classic.
5497080	5500520	And again, if you're listening on the podcast feed, you can't see the video of this.
5500520	5503720	I think the visual really sparks that memory for a lot of people.
5503720	5508280	So I really encourage you to Google like image, one of these Mattel handheld electronic
5508280	5510680	football and, and I'm sorry, was it Mattel?
5511400	5512040	Yeah, Mattel.
5512040	5512760	Yeah, it was Mattel.
5512760	5516280	So I really encourage you to look, uh, and by the way, actually this, um, YouTube
5516280	5518840	we're playing here actually says this is one of the remade ones.
5518840	5520520	This isn't the one from the seventies.
5520520	5525320	So it's enough, you know, that it shows how the game played.
5525320	5529560	I mean, gosh, these things, they were pretty inexpensive.
5529560	5533160	I think the rereleases and now though you can't really find them as well anymore,
5533160	5534920	which is why they've gone up inexpensive.
5534920	5535420	Yeah.
5535960	5536680	All right.
5536680	5537640	Well, there you go.
5537640	5538140	Great pick.
5539080	5544120	Uh, we'll get another one next month, uh, with our classic electronic handheld of the
5544120	5544600	month.
5544600	5545000	Awesome.
5545000	5545500	Awesome.
5546060	5546540	All right.
5546540	5551900	Uh, we are going to get into our next segment, which is some rapid fire news and quickly
5551900	5554540	talk about some other things going on in the gaming industry.
5554540	5555040	Loki.
5555820	5556140	Yeah.
5556140	5561180	So suicide squad killed the justice league has been delayed to 2023.
5561900	5567260	They need more time, you know, to make the game as polished as they can possibly be.
5568860	5569500	No big deal.
5570300	5576380	Um, and then there's this funny mod that's coming out for halo three on PC.
5576940	5579100	It adds a Chevy Tahoe to it.
5579100	5580460	Now why a Chevy Tahoe?
5580460	5585500	Because that was in the trailer for the new paramount plus series, which doesn't make
5585500	5591660	any sense that this vintage 500 year old Chevy Tahoe would be in there, but because, you
5591660	5593100	know, product placement is a thing.
5594220	5596780	Now it's a thing in your PC version of halo three.
5597180	5597680	Sure.
5598700	5599340	Why not?
5601100	5601600	Yeah.
5602380	5602880	All right.
5604540	5605180	Uh, Dar Sarah.
5606220	5611580	So, um, well, that, uh, Nickelodeon, uh, all star brawl is getting a new character.
5612140	5614940	Uh, they are getting, uh, the shredder.
5615980	5618140	Maybe all that hardware is for making coleslaw.
5618140	5619900	Tonight I dine on turtle soup.
5622060	5622860	But yeah, he is.
5622940	5631180	Yeah, he is in the game and it is definitely, you know, nineties cartoon shredder.
5632140	5639020	And then, uh, in other news, uh, and this, this is pertinent to a lot of our listeners
5639020	5639520	interests.
5640060	5647740	Um, the Pokemon legends, uh, has sold, uh, 6.5 million copies worldwide in seven days.
5648300	5653260	And it puts it above Pokemon sword and shield in terms of its sales.
5653980	5657260	So good job, consumer horse.
5657260	5659180	Did you say seven days?
5660940	5661900	I think you did.
5663420	5666140	You know, all that makes me one is the, the bingo.
5668860	5670380	Bob coffee and chat points out.
5670380	5673420	It would have sold more if they fucking ship more than five copies.
5673420	5674460	You know, that's a good point.
5674540	5678300	There's a lot of people that didn't even get their copy until this week.
5678300	5681180	I guess some of the distribution was having problems.
5681180	5685500	I mean, shock and in this day and age, uh, you know, I got mine digitally, so it was
5685500	5686060	whatever.
5686060	5689740	But I think a lot of people that did opt for the physical edition, for whatever reason,
5689740	5692380	you're entitled to that, uh, had to wait a little longer.
5692380	5698060	Cause I think the official ones from, from like the Pokemon store online or whatever
5698060	5698860	took were delayed.
5698860	5700060	Like most of those were delayed.
5700060	5706700	So it is interesting that it sold so well, uh, even amongst all those issues, but I think
5706700	5711740	just also goes to show the strength that, um, you know, the Pokemon fandom is craving,
5711740	5713740	uh, some other types of ideas.
5713740	5718780	And I think it all but guarantees we will see this legends concept again, whether it
5718780	5724540	is legitimately a sequel to legends or like even, uh, the next mainline game, looking
5724540	5728860	a little more, uh, like a hybrid, uh, we'll see, we will see.
5730140	5731500	So, oh wow.
5731500	5737660	Bob coffee says, uh, kind of clarifying their comments as our store only received five copies.
5737660	5738540	Holy moly.
5738540	5742300	Yeah, I guess, uh, LOL supply chain.
5742300	5744860	I guess the rest were, uh, stuck in the Panama canal.
5745580	5750300	Uh, DJ Ramirez says one of our staffers got her Pokemon brilliant diamond late due to
5750300	5751580	shipping from Pokemon.
5751580	5754220	When she got it, she ended up with two copies of the game.
5754860	5757100	I guess good things come to those who wait.
5757100	5757900	It was interest.
5758700	5761420	The Pokemon bread while it was in transit.
5761420	5764860	I don't know the egg hatched insert joke here.
5765580	5766060	All right.
5766060	5769980	Let's, uh, travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games, uh,
5769980	5773500	that are going to try to sell 6.5 million copies next week.
5773500	5775740	Let's start in the U S they'll try.
5775740	5776940	They'll try.
5776940	5778700	Let's see if any of them can do it.
5778700	5784620	Loki, any, anything in the U S uh, yeah, we've got all the Ali world on PC, Nintendo switch,
5785260	5792780	PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series, uh, Sifu on PC, PlayStation
5792780	5798540	four and PlayStation five crossfire X on Xbox one and Xbox series.
5799500	5803500	And then we have all of the kingdom hearts coming to Nintendo switch.
5803500	5812780	So kingdom hearts, HD 1.5 remix, uh, HD 2.5 remix, HD 2.8 final chapter prologue and kingdom
5812780	5815340	hearts three all on Nintendo switch.
5815340	5817900	And last but not least lost arc on PC.
5819020	5820300	Oh, that lost arc.
5820300	5821980	A lot of people trying to sell me on that one.
5821980	5823180	I might have to check that out.
5823180	5824140	Sounds pretty interesting.
5825260	5828060	Uh, going over to Japan and checking out the releases this week.
5828060	5830940	We've got, we've got some titles this week on the Nintendo switch.
5830940	5834860	Let me tell you, we have a game called let's play curling is coming out.
5834860	5835580	Fuck yeah.
5835580	5836220	Curling.
5836220	5841100	I mean, and how, how, uh, at pro pro the timing is with the Olympics going on right now.
5841100	5844620	I know we haven't brought that up yet, but you know, that's, that is going on.
5844620	5850220	And curling curling is that thing that like used to be like the whole, Hey, did you stay
5850220	5853660	up until 2 AM and watch the curling and like, it used to be like that thing that nobody
5853660	5854140	knew about.
5854140	5857660	And now I do feel like it's that thing that like, people are like, Oh, it's the winter
5857660	5857980	Olympics.
5857980	5858780	You know what that means?
5858780	5859180	Curling.
5859180	5860540	It's the only time it's on TV.
5860540	5861020	Fuck yeah.
5861020	5861500	Curling.
5862060	5862780	Okay.
5862780	5864140	I have to make a side note.
5864140	5866540	That should be the name of the U S release of this game.
5866540	5867020	Fuck yeah.
5867020	5867500	Curling.
5867500	5873260	You know, I like the show Canada's worst driver when it was on.
5873900	5881260	They, they, for one of their driving accuracy things like to do control, they have, they
5881260	5882060	had curling.
5882060	5885900	They created a giant puck and you had to steer it with the car.
5888540	5889340	Sounds awesome.
5889340	5891180	That's the most Canadian thing I've ever heard.
5892060	5894380	Another big release in Japan this week.
5894380	5896860	Uh, I'm sorry, this is too good.
5896860	5903340	It's by idea factory on the switch called my next life as a villainous, all roots lead
5903340	5904140	to doom.
5904140	5905740	Pirates that stir the waters.
5906540	5907100	I love it.
5908060	5910380	There's so many subtitles and they're all great.
5910380	5912060	That's like three games in one.
5912060	5912940	Which, what is it?
5912940	5916140	A villainous routes leading to doom or pirates?
5916140	5917260	Are you sure it's not about me?
5918220	5921500	I did think of you when I read this dark soccer, you should take a look.
5921500	5921820	Hold on.
5921820	5923020	I'll just post this in the chat.
5923020	5923420	I don't care.
5923420	5923740	Hold on.
5923740	5925420	I'm going to post this link in the chat.
5925420	5928540	Uh, because then when you look at the game, you're going to be like, what the fuck is
5928540	5928780	this?
5928780	5931740	This isn't, this isn't any of those things at all, actually.
5932780	5934860	Uh, and, uh, let's see orange, right.
5934860	5937420	In chat points out, it's a light novel.
5937420	5942780	And yeah, when you actually kind of look at the box art and what it's about, um, it's,
5942780	5948300	uh, the character has memories of her previous life as a high school girl in the world of
5948300	5949020	fortune lover.
5949020	5953660	She was reincarnated as a villainous who stood in between the love of the main characters
5954140	5959500	whose endings only lead to a future of exile or death, but managed to avoid the destruction
5959500	5960940	flags of the game safely.
5961500	5966380	So this, there's a whole lot of drama going on in this game.
5966380	5972300	There's some stories in this, but, um, it's the type of stories.
5972300	5973900	It does check out that.
5973900	5978700	Check out some of those screenshots that, uh, there's some, uh, there's some things going
5978700	5979740	on in those screenshots.
5979740	5983260	Anyway, those are your big titles on the squit switch this week.
5983260	5987500	So you get curling or trashy romance novel game.
5987500	5989420	Uh, it's kind of your picks.
5990060	5990780	Why not both?
5991660	5992380	Why, why not?
5992380	5996860	But at the same time, my life as a villainous eternal doom in curling.
5998300	5998780	All right.
5998780	6001740	Anyway, there's dark soccer's game.
6003900	6006940	I actually found something on the site that interests me a lot more.
6006940	6007740	Oh, what's that?
6007740	6009900	That's the switch version of Pocky and Rocky.
6009900	6015980	Oh, uh, meanwhile on the PlayStation five, uh, some releases this week chorus, uh, a
6015980	6019100	plague tale innocence gets its Japanese release this week.
6019100	6020860	And there are some peripherals as well.
6020860	6025580	There's, uh, um, like a racing wheel that comes out that supports some games and all
6025580	6026540	that good stuff.
6026540	6028460	Um, yeah, so there you go.
6028460	6030060	Those are your Japanese releases.
6030060	6031340	How about the UK dark soccer?
6032300	6035420	In the UK, we have summer in Mara.
6035900	6038380	Uh, that is, um, February 11th.
6038380	6039980	Actually, all of these are on February 11th.
6040540	6045660	Uh, we have bass master fishing, deluxe 20, uh, 20, 22.
6045660	6050060	Uh, you have unbound worlds apart for PlayStation.
6050060	6054940	And then on the switch, the grand theft auto, uh, the, the trilogy, the definitive.
6057180	6059740	The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the VV.
6062700	6066860	Sorry, I'm laughing at dark Tetsuya's comment and chat card curling Sakura.
6067260	6067760	No.
6069260	6069760	Yes.
6071500	6072000	No.
6072300	6072800	Yes.
6074060	6074560	No.
6074700	6075200	Yes.
6076220	6077820	Have to say yes to that.
6077820	6078320	Yay.
6078780	6079280	Yes.
6079740	6080240	All right.
6082220	6083020	Moving on.
6084220	6085420	Let's talk about another thing.
6085420	6088460	A lot of people say no or yes to in our next story.
6088460	6088960	Loki.
6090300	6091020	Uh, yes.
6091020	6094060	Everyone's favorite game of the week or game of the day.
6094060	6099420	I guess a wordle has been purchased by the New York times because the New York times
6099420	6106540	is not one to bow down from, uh, joining in the game or game company acquisition.
6106540	6110940	That is, you know, Sony and Microsoft New York times Salsas.
6111900	6116780	Poison to be a, you know, big game developer publisher house or whatever.
6117340	6120220	Um, no, really like the advertisement.
6120220	6125580	Maybe, you know, going to bring people to their site or something, um,
6125580	6127660	put it behind their paywall eventually.
6127660	6127980	Oh God.
6127980	6128700	I hope not.
6128700	6129660	Oh, they will.
6129660	6130300	They will.
6130300	6133900	If you look, if you read their comments, they're like, oh, we're not putting it behind a paywall
6133900	6134400	initially.
6135740	6136240	Initially.
6136860	6140860	Like they're digital subscription growth strategy.
6140860	6141420	Yeah.
6141420	6141920	Yeah.
6143580	6149500	Congrats to the New York times who was, uh, honestly, uh, not knowing enough about technology
6149500	6151020	and the fact that people have already right.
6151020	6152780	Click, save this game to play for it.
6152780	6154220	Like literally, literally that's the thing.
6154220	6157820	Everybody's like, you could just right click, save wordle and you can just play it, uh, for
6157820	6162220	the, for the next like five years, uh, without worrying about a paywall or anything like
6162220	6162780	that.
6162780	6167660	Uh, so congrats to the New York times for really being dumb enough to buy wordle now
6168780	6171580	before, you know, I just sound like I'm a complete jerk.
6172220	6177020	I'll say major, major props to the guy and I forgot his name, but his last name is something
6177020	6182060	like word wordle or something like he has a very, his, like his last name is very similar
6182060	6182940	to the name of the games.
6182940	6184220	It's kind of funny.
6184220	6184700	I do.
6184700	6187180	I do not fault that guy one bit.
6187180	6187580	Good.
6187580	6189260	In fact, good on him.
6189260	6192460	Good on the spouse that inspired the game apparently and all that stuff.
6192460	6194060	Cause she liked word games or whatever.
6194060	6199020	Good on both of them for taking the money and running and cashing that check and getting
6199020	6200300	an early retirement.
6200300	6203340	I don't fault them one goddamn bit and neither should anyone.
6203340	6204940	Uh, good for them.
6204940	6210140	Uh, I think the New York times was really boneheaded in this.
6210140	6214140	Uh, but now they'll own the trademark.
6214140	6219020	Um, there isn't one now, but you, you betcha, uh, New York times is going to file a trademark
6219020	6222700	and they would be very smart to try to get on a mobile app or something like that.
6222700	6228700	But, uh, I just, I think the wordle gas tank only has so much fuel left in it and yeah,
6228700	6232940	it's kind of the social media thing of the moment, but we're still in the, you know,
6232940	6238220	hopefully closing days of the pandemic where, you know, we're not getting together in person
6238220	6239340	the way that we used to.
6239340	6243580	So sharing our wordle scores online is one of those things that brings some of us joy.
6243580	6246780	Um, but eventually we're going to be back in person again.
6246780	6251900	And I just think wordle is going to fade out as quickly into the night as it showed up.
6251900	6255260	Um, and there's so many wordle clones now.
6255260	6258700	Uh, thank you, Bobby Blackwell for reminding me, Josh Wardle was the guy's name.
6258700	6259420	Thank you.
6259420	6260220	Uh, and point out.
6260220	6261580	And yeah, he talked about this in his story.
6261580	6264700	I rebuilt wordle in C64 basic.
6264700	6264940	Yeah.
6264940	6265660	It's interesting.
6265660	6267500	Wordle has actually, you know what wordle is?
6268060	6268940	It's flappy bird.
6269580	6271100	Wordle is flappy bird.
6271100	6272300	That's exactly what it is.
6272860	6274140	And now it's like that.
6274140	6275100	It's that clone.
6275100	6276700	That's going to show up everywhere.
6276700	6281660	Cause we've seen, I've seen Mike Deft posting the wordle in Spanish scores.
6281660	6284940	I see loodle with all the naughty words like twats.
6285740	6287340	That's that one's fun.
6287340	6291500	Uh, and then, uh, what I see the one with like the 10 letter long words and all this
6291500	6295580	stuff, like there are just, there are so many knockoffs of wordle and it's just like when
6295580	6296700	flappy bird came out.
6296700	6297340	Right.
6297340	6302220	Then everything in the app store was some rip off of, or, and Google play and all of
6302220	6304300	it was just, and then there was flappy vog.
6304300	6308780	Bobby Blackwell built flappy vog, which I was going to say is still playable on the
6308780	6312860	site, but I actually think that's a lie because I think the, the integration that
6312860	6314140	it uses no longer works.
6314860	6319420	How dare you render it as a HTML five app.
6319420	6319660	Yeah.
6319660	6321100	And who's going to take the time to do that.
6323500	6330220	So, um, so now Bobby says, this is, this is my good pet project to learn new languages.
6330220	6333980	And he talked about this on his show a little bit is that, uh, you know, when you
6333980	6339260	build your first game, the way that Loki did it is the wrong way to do it.
6339260	6345020	You do not start your first game being some overly ambitious project about cars
6345020	6347660	getting into big wrecks, and then you don't end up finishing them.
6347660	6348220	No offense.
6348860	6350380	The game you did finish turned out great.
6350380	6351100	There was no wrecks.
6351900	6358460	But Bobby says, start with poker, start with hangman, start with flappy bird, start
6358460	6359820	with wordle.
6360700	6365420	So wordle is just the flappy bird of 2022 is really what it is.
6365420	6366300	And that's, that's it.
6366860	6368220	So, all right.
6368220	6370540	And, uh, Bobby bringing the technical explanation.
6370540	6374140	I knew it was something, uh, it's not playable anymore due to the unity.
6374140	6377420	Game player is no longer supported by browsers.
6377420	6381100	So if you had an old browser or something, it might work, but, um, not likely.
6381100	6383740	So, uh, dark to see it says I concur with Rob.
6383740	6387500	Start with something simple, breakout space, invaders, that kind of thing.
6387500	6388000	Yeah.
6389020	6393260	Um, or build a game for a system that doesn't exist anymore.
6393260	6393420	Right?
6393420	6394060	Dark Sakura.
6395020	6395520	Hmm.
6396380	6397180	Yeah, there is that.
6397180	6403260	So you had to say that right when I'm drinking, um, there is a game called eye of typhoon
6403260	6408220	and, uh, it is, uh, being released in the United States.
6408780	6413420	Um, it actually is, uh, a Korea, a South Korean game.
6413980	6420860	And, uh, not only is it going to be getting a PC release, it's coming out on the 3dio.
6420860	6424300	Oh, guess who has a 3dio.
6425340	6427420	I know you, you must have one.
6427420	6428700	I think we have a 3dio.
6428700	6430540	But is it hooked up now?
6430540	6431420	Let me go.
6431420	6433740	Bobby Black Wolf is your, of course he just popped up.
6433740	6434380	I have a 3dio.
6434380	6435020	Is it hooked up?
6436060	6436560	It's okay.
6439740	6442380	Bobby, Bobby, get close to the monitor, Bobby.
6445100	6449420	I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell, uh, tell Dan that we need this game.
6449420	6451020	No, I have seen Bobby's living room.
6451020	6452060	It's, it's pretty great.
6452700	6455980	Get Bobby to post a picture of the box collection from the seventies and eighties.
6455980	6457580	That's the really impressive part.
6458780	6463500	Well, we're, uh, we talked about actually Dan's thinking of selling the Mustang and
6463500	6465100	we're going to convert the garage.
6465100	6465740	Oh, wowee.
6466300	6467100	That's a big step.
6468300	6472060	Yeah, but we're thinking of converting the garage to our new game room.
6474220	6478540	But who, who would have thought a new 3dio game in the year 2022, but this, this is going
6478540	6484780	to be huge for, um, um, you know, somebody, no people that are in the retro scene, Genesis
6484780	6487820	game that came out, that everyone was all hot and bothered over.
6487820	6489020	And then it didn't play very well.
6489660	6495020	Well, I mean, and people are making games for the Nintendo entertainment system and
6495020	6496780	actually putting them on cartridges.
6496780	6501820	Can you believe what a world who would do that?
6502780	6507340	Uh, LM orchard and chat says, if I had a 3dio, it would just be the machine that plays Zelda,
6507340	6508860	the Wanda Gamelon.
6508860	6509100	Yeah.
6509100	6513180	For five minutes until you were a member, how fucking terrible that game really was.
6513180	6518220	I mean, that game exists to be in awesome games done quick and summer games done quick
6518220	6520300	and, uh, and then that's it.
6520300	6525420	Like it's a game does not hold up well in my, in my humble opinion.
6526780	6527100	All right.
6527740	6531980	Uh, let's talk about something we hope doesn't hold up very well over time.
6531980	6532380	Loki.
6533740	6534140	Yes.
6534700	6535180	Yes.
6535180	6540860	It is our weekly discussion of NFTs and how I just, okay.
6540860	6544300	I want to point out Loki had like four stories about NFTs tonight.
6544300	6545100	I said, you know what?
6545980	6550060	Not today, Satan, not, not, not, not calling Loki Satan, but I'm calling, you know what
6550060	6555260	Satan said not to, I'm burying this in part B of the show and you know what we can just,
6555260	6557980	we're going to put it in one segment and then be done with it.
6557980	6564060	I'm not going to talk about this half the show again, but please give us our update
6564060	6567420	on these new fucked up things.
6567980	6568300	Yeah.
6568300	6573660	So itch.io, um, made a statement on Twitter talking about NFTs saying NFTs are scams.
6574220	6579340	And if you think they're legitimately useful for anything other than the exploitation of
6579340	6584380	creators, financial scams, and the destruction of the planet, we ask, please reevaluate your
6584380	6585100	life choices.
6585900	6588540	So that sums of that pretty well, I think.
6589340	6600140	Um, and then of course we had team 17 trying to license the worms for NFTs and then that
6600140	6602940	got, you know, struck down pretty fast.
6602940	6604860	People were very angry at that.
6605500	6611580	And so they have decided to, um, not do that anymore.
6611580	6614860	There's many people in chat by the way, cheering for itch.io.
6614940	6618940	If you'd like to show your support for itch.io, you can go to the website and then search
6618940	6622380	for tech master games and then buy the game that's available there.
6622380	6625260	And that'll be showing itch.io that you support their stance.
6625260	6625500	Right.
6625500	6625820	Loki.
6627020	6627340	Right.
6628460	6632940	Um, so yeah, they, they decided to go ahead master games and then buy the game that comes
6632940	6635580	up or just, yeah, search for pixel two summer too.
6635580	6637180	Um, yeah.
6637180	6642460	So apparently they have decided to, um, well, I grow crab games.
6642460	6647900	Basically you put out a tweet saying that they believe that NFTs cannot be environmentally
6647900	6651660	friendly or useful and are really just an overall grift.
6651660	6657660	Please do not harass the employees at team 17 or devs under their umbrellas as this decision
6657660	6660940	seems to have taken everyone off guard and likely came from the very top.
6661740	6663900	Um, which is unfortunate.
6663900	6669340	Then of course, um, you have, you know, companies that are kind of changing their position on
6669340	6669420	it.
6669420	6677580	So EA, um, Andrew Wilson is saying now that, um, going from calling NFTs the important
6677580	6683660	part of the future of our industry to, you know, walking away from them slightly and,
6683660	6684860	you know, anything that brings.
6685660	6687420	It's basically, let me try to see here.
6687420	6690060	It says right now it's not something we're driving hard on.
6690860	6699180	Um, you know, looking like needed to past, uh, capital fads around 3d AR and VR.
6701420	6704940	Sony wants, or I should say meta wants to talk to you about their metaverse, you know,
6704940	6706540	if you want to talk about fads.
6706540	6712060	Um, by the way, by the way, random tangent, but it's, it's more important than, um, uh,
6712060	6714140	NFTs and that's talking about poop.
6714140	6718460	And Bobby Blacklove points out that pixel poops number two apparently came out a year
6718460	6719020	ago.
6719020	6723420	Uh, the itch IO page says he bought it 357 days ago.
6723420	6725900	I, what is time anymore in a pandemic?
6725900	6726860	Did you know that Loki?
6726860	6727820	It's, it's the birthday.
6729420	6729980	How about that?
6730700	6732940	Yeah, I'm pretty sure Bobby bought it day one.
6732940	6735740	So that's, you know, that means yesterday was the first birthday.
6737980	6738540	How about that?
6739180	6740300	Happy birthday poop.
6743660	6745420	Anyway, uh, back to NFT.
6746380	6746860	Yes.
6746860	6750540	And then, then of course you have the companies that are doubling down on it.
6751180	6758300	And so Ubisoft course is, uh, gifting NFTs to their employees, which I'm sure really
6758300	6759660	appreciate that.
6759660	6764860	Uh, one of those is, uh, one to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ghost recon.
6765740	6769740	Um, one developer said, you know, we hate this crypto stuff.
6769740	6770140	Okay.
6770860	6773660	You know, with, um, Ubisoft saying, okay, come get some.
6774380	6783260	Um, they don't get it is basically the tone, um, that the developers think that they have
6783260	6785100	with this whole Ubisoft reports platform.
6785820	6792220	Um, again, I'm going to interrupt your NFT talk because, uh, it has come to my attention
6792220	6794140	that my brain blue screened of death.
6794140	6798380	Uh, when talking about the numbers there, uh, there's actually 365 days in a year and
6798380	6799980	my brain did something with those numbers.
6799980	6803500	So it's actually the birthday of pixel poops is February 13th.
6803500	6804220	So it's coming up.
6804220	6806780	So it's not too late to buy the game of cake.
6808620	6813980	I mean, it came out like never was next week, but yeah, but I mean, Loki, seriously, you
6813980	6815020	deserve a cake.
6815020	6816220	So get yourself a cake.
6817500	6823580	Um, and then last but not least, Konami remains committed to the future of the NFT market
6823580	6824060	projects.
6824620	6826060	So this is not the end.
6826060	6832300	They will be producing more NFTs because they made money off of absolutely literally nothing,
6832300	6833980	zero effort on their part.
6833980	6837020	And so of course, why wouldn't they double down on this?
6837020	6840460	Besides, I hear the pachinko business isn't doing that great in Japan right now.
6840460	6843020	So yeah.
6843020	6846140	Um, all right.
6846140	6853020	Every everybody with me on the count of three, one, two, three.
6853020	6860220	Thank you.
6862300	6866300	And as with that, we've purged the entities from our system.
6866300	6867100	Thank you.
6867100	6871340	Uh, Chad is suggesting that we have some theme music to go with this, such as Yakety Sax
6871340	6871820	or something.
6871820	6877580	I mean, those songs are copyright and I don't know, maybe there's some Pokemon music we
6877580	6878060	can play.
6878060	6884460	They'll play the team rocket theme or whatever the equivalent.
6887260	6887580	Yes.
6889660	6890380	Okay.
6890380	6890700	Okay.
6890700	6894780	I'll be, I'll be, when we get to the new setup, I'll be set up for that.
6895340	6899740	So we'll do that team galaxy or whatever they were called in gen four.
6900380	6900700	All right.
6901340	6902060	Moving on.
6903180	6905020	Let's talk about something that's actually pretty cool.
6905020	6909580	Let's talk about, uh, finally PlayStation integration with discord.
6909580	6914220	Um, now I kind of thought you could do this before you could already integrate like your
6914220	6919580	PlayStation tag in discord, but now you can go a step further and discord will now show
6919580	6923820	like what games you're actually playing on PlayStation four, PlayStation five.
6923820	6928940	In fact, when you signed into discord recently, excuse me, sorry.
6928940	6932780	Hopefully you'd have joined the vog network discord server, which is available at vog
6932780	6935900	network.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord.
6935900	6939500	That's one of those places you can send me messages throughout the week that create good
6939500	6942140	topic ideas that then I want to talk about it on the show.
6942140	6943820	Um, that's one place to message me.
6943820	6945740	Um, or dark soccer.
6945740	6949260	If you want to talk about Deb by daylight or anything like that, or Loki, if you want
6949260	6953580	to talk about Minecraft or how much you're watching his videos and enjoying them, uh,
6953580	6957260	you can do that on our discord vognetwork.com slash discord, and you can also now connect
6957260	6962380	your PlayStation four and five, your PSN accounts to show what is it that you're doing.
6962620	6965100	On your PlayStation will show on your discord profile.
6965100	6967020	Maybe you don't want people to know that's okay.
6967020	6968140	Cause you can hide that too.
6968780	6972860	By the way, this functionality has existed for Xbox and the market for, for a little
6972860	6978460	while now, but it's nice that Sony is there too, especially because we heard like a while
6978460	6982540	ago that Sony and discord were doing like a strategic partnership kind of thing.
6982540	6987820	So I feel like this is weird that it took this long to get here, but okay.
6988380	6990540	Anyway, the pop-up has come up for a lot of people.
6990540	6995020	So you probably saw it that way, but if you missed it, go to the discord app on your web,
6995020	7000860	on the web browser or mobile, whatever, go to the connections section of the user settings.
7000860	7004940	And then where all the other connected accounts are, cause you can connect your Twitch
7004940	7007980	and all that stuff, uh, connect your PSN account there.
7007980	7009660	Uh, and, uh, there you go.
7011260	7016940	So, uh, we'll see what else comes out of that partnership that they formed back in May,
7017580	7019340	um, in the coming months.
7019340	7019840	Interesting.
7021100	7023500	Especially because do you remember this?
7023500	7027340	Remember at one point, Microsoft was going to buy discord and then that didn't happen.
7027340	7027900	You remember that?
7027900	7030060	That was only about a year ago that'll happen.
7030060	7032140	Uh, they were going to buy them for 10 billion.
7032140	7035100	Um, but discord is staying an independent company.
7035100	7035900	So interesting.
7037420	7042300	Discord in a blog post said we are excited to continue our partnership with PlayStation
7042300	7047420	and explore how we can collectively create great shared experiences for your friends
7047420	7048380	and communities.
7049100	7050060	We'll see what develops.
7052060	7052940	All right.
7052940	7053580	Anyway.
7053580	7054620	Uh, Oh, that's it.
7055740	7060940	We're now to the listener round table where we invite your calls over at vognetwork.com
7060940	7061900	slash discord.
7061900	7063740	So there's another plug for that.
7063740	7067660	Uh, you can join the green room and we will get to some calls if anybody decides to be
7067660	7068940	brave enough to call in.
7068940	7075500	We also like to do emails, although I can't recall if I saw any, um, participate at orange
7075500	7076940	lounge radio.com.
7076940	7078380	No, no.
7079180	7082860	So usually this would be the place where dark soccer and I talk about drag race, but admittedly
7082860	7084220	I haven't been watching.
7084220	7086220	So remind me of this case.
7086220	7091100	I guess it'd be a good place to really talk about that Kickstarter that, uh, about drag
7091100	7092060	her or whatever it was called.
7093020	7094300	It looked pretty fun.
7094300	7101260	I mean, the, the rewards on there though were, I mean, some of them got to be pretty big.
7101820	7107100	Like if you spent like five grand that flight, you had to provide your own ticket, but they'd
7107100	7111820	go to Los Angeles and participate in all this stuff and whatever.
7111820	7115500	And I'm like, that doesn't sound like it would happen.
7116460	7121820	Um, but I just, I just got the one to get my copy of the game.
7121820	7124780	Um, it looks, it looks like fun.
7124780	7130380	I mean, I wonder if you're going to have like the shade attack or the reading attack or
7130380	7130780	something.
7131500	7137500	Probably just a bunch of isms ripped off from drag race, which in turn was ripped off from
7137500	7138380	Paris is burning.
7138380	7142380	And, you know, it's just been, you know, it, it looks interesting though.
7142380	7143820	I mean, I think it's going to be fun.
7143820	7144220	Oh yeah.
7144220	7145660	It'll be, it'll be cute.
7145660	7147500	So yeah, I'll check it out.
7147500	7153580	If it, if it ends up being, you know, actually something that, uh, that does reach its funding.
7155500	7157740	I do have one thing I'll say about drag race.
7157740	7161020	And again, we talked drag race because we didn't get any emails participate at orange
7161020	7161980	launch radio.com.
7161980	7166060	So when we don't get emails, we assume the email says, tell us your thoughts on drag
7166060	7166860	race.
7166860	7173740	Now I haven't really been watching either series, but I will say this about UK versus
7173740	7174300	the world.
7174300	7175740	That one that's airing right now.
7175740	7177020	I'm going to say this about that.
7177900	7184060	I done told you years ago, pangina heels is fucking hot.
7184060	7185100	Number one.
7185100	7186220	And it's fucking talented.
7186220	7190700	Number two, I done said that on that podcast I used to do with, uh, captain spike and slide
7190700	7191420	kick and Delvin.
7191420	7194860	We had that show for a while and that was right when Thailand season one came out.
7194860	7200140	And I told you then hot, talented.
7200140	7204940	And now, now y'all learning that watching UK versus the world there, there, there is
7204940	7206460	no other queen than pangina heels.
7206460	7211420	In my opinion, she's already been told, I already told you, I already told, I'm glad
7211420	7212700	the rest of you caught up.
7212700	7217580	Finally, I, in all reality, I'm actually thrilled that pangina heels gets a spotlight
7217580	7222220	on this because, you know, unfortunately with drag race, Thailand, not being in English,
7222220	7225980	let's, you know, be, I mean, it was great for people in that country, but people in
7225980	7231180	us, Britain, Canada, couldn't really experience or get to know pangina heels.
7231180	7235420	So I'm really glad that she has this platform for people to be able to get to know her.
7235420	7237260	So I'm very glad about that.
7237260	7237580	All right.
7237580	7238860	Yeah, there you go.
7238860	7239580	That's it.
7239580	7240140	Okay.
7240140	7240780	Straight man.
7241420	7242300	One more thing.
7242300	7243100	What?
7243100	7249180	The, uh, it's like something like a, uh, Twitch, uh, LGBT award that's going on.
7249180	7249660	Oh yeah.
7249660	7250140	I heard about it.
7250140	7250940	We weren't nominated.
7250940	7251500	How about that?
7252540	7259900	Well, Evo though, who is, uh, a drag queen, uh, Dead by Daylight streamer has been nominated
7259900	7262380	and was just recently, uh, named a Twitch ambassador.
7263020	7265580	I saw, um, I lurk in her channel sometimes.
7265580	7267420	She doesn't even know who I am, but I lurk in her channel sometimes.
7267420	7269100	Holly got nominated for something with that?
7269740	7271820	Uh, yeah, it's me, Holly.
7271820	7272320	Yeah.
7273180	7276700	I didn't see Holly on the, uh, there's two categories.
7276700	7278220	One is like big streamer.
7278220	7281180	One is like up and coming streamer and she's on the up and coming one.
7281180	7281740	Yeah.
7281740	7282240	Yeah.
7282700	7283740	Holly's great.
7283740	7289500	I really enjoy Holly's, um, Holly's streams, but I'll be honest.
7289500	7292700	The person I've been spending a lot more time in lately, um, you know,
7292700	7295260	apart from my usuals is, uh, the lady bird.
7296140	7296640	Okay.
7297740	7298860	Really, really fun.
7299100	7305420	I actually got her husband as a survivor in Dead by Daylight once.
7305420	7306140	It was pretty funny.
7307100	7309260	I was like, wait, are you who I think you are?
7309260	7310460	It's like, are you dark Sakura?
7310460	7312220	I'm like, yeah, it was pretty funny.
7312220	7312720	That's funny.
7313340	7314220	Um, okay.
7314220	7319100	So of course we open up this segment as well to, uh, your questions in discord.
7319100	7321100	And, uh, there's a couple of questions coming in here.
7321100	7325500	So let's start with Bobby Blackwell's question who says, is Dan getting a rush pinball yet?
7327100	7328540	He didn't think it looked that exciting.
7329100	7334860	I want it for the music, but honestly it, it didn't have a lot of the fun twists that
7334860	7335980	some of the other pinballs do.
7337340	7337840	All right.
7338540	7342540	It's, it's kind of middle of the road as far as a pinball goes,
7342540	7345340	but I still want it for the music and the theme.
7345340	7345840	Yeah.
7346300	7349180	Um, as the show under Matt says, what's everyone's streaming?
7349180	7352380	I was watching murderville this week, which has been hilarious.
7352380	7357900	Uh, so not, not streaming games, but like other, I guess, media, uh, TV movie type of thing.
7357900	7363180	The book of Boba Fett or AKA the Mandalorian part two.
7364780	7370540	Um, I don't watch a lot of TV, but I have been watching Australian survivor, um, who I think,
7370540	7373340	and I know people have very strong opinions on survivor.
7373340	7374700	They either love it or they hate it.
7374700	7375500	And I get it.
7375500	7380540	But, um, I will say this Australia is producing a better show right now than the U S like I am
7380540	7382700	so sold on Australia's survivor.
7382700	7383980	It's so good.
7383980	7388380	Uh, and this particular season has, uh, and I am a Sandra fan boy.
7388380	7390220	I think she, she is the queen.
7390220	7394620	And the fact that the fact that they got her to do the Australia version, I think is huge.
7394620	7397500	And I just, I just love watching her and her daughter play in the,
7397500	7399340	the rest of the cast is really good too.
7399340	7401500	So props to a Australian survivor.
7401500	7406220	That's what I've been streaming, quote unquote streaming, but secretly,
7406220	7412380	it's a secret group online that has links to pirate the episodes because paramount plus
7412380	7417660	teased us with adding Australian survivor, but won't do it day and date as it's airing live.
7417660	7420380	And the show like survivor gets spoiled very easy.
7420380	7422300	So as far as I'm concerned, that's paramount.
7422300	7423180	Plus is lost.
7423180	7424220	Yes, I will pirate it.
7424700	7427180	Uh, I would have, I would have happily watched it on your platform.
7427180	7429420	Paramount plus get with, get with the times.
7429420	7432140	We live in a world environment.
7432140	7435500	I don't know why, uh, Loki, what are you streaming?
7435900	7440460	Um, King of the Hill.
7443660	7444160	Why not?
7445420	7447340	Hey, streaming is to watch old stuff too.
7447340	7447840	Why not?
7448700	7449260	All right.
7449260	7451980	It's either King of the Hill or a Barefoot Contessa.
7454540	7455980	Why not both at the same time?
7457260	7462540	Um, Dartitsuya says maybe a long shot, but has anyone checked out the Cotton reboot?
7462620	7465900	The wife got it for me and it's the cutest shmup I've ever played.
7465900	7467820	I've really been meaning to check it out.
7467820	7470700	I haven't yet, but it looks super cute.
7470700	7473820	Uh, and I'm sure dark soccer has just now been reminded of it and it's like,
7473820	7474700	I should probably get that.
7475420	7476060	I have it.
7476060	7476620	Oh, you do?
7476620	7477500	Oh, what do you think?
7477500	7479180	Yeah, it was gifted to me.
7479180	7480940	Oh, love that.
7481980	7484220	So, um, I haven't played it yet though.
7484220	7484720	Nope.
7485100	7485600	Get on it.
7486240	7493200	Um, Cotton requires a certain amount of attention that I've been sorely lacking lately.
7493920	7494560	I understand.
7495600	7501200	Uh, ZenMonkey11 says, uh, they're streaming Big Brother, which I got to, usually I'm into
7501200	7507120	those, but the cast, the cast was so unexciting this year.
7507120	7507620	Sorry.
7508480	7510800	I just, I'm not interested in anyone on the cast.
7512560	7513200	Sorry about it.
7514080	7519440	Um, Sia Tiberius suggests the Barefoot King of the Hill or Contessa of the Hill.
7519440	7520800	I like Barefoot King of the Hill.
7521760	7524320	Uh, DJ Rama S says King of the Hill is a great anime.
7524320	7524800	Yes.
7524800	7526080	King of the Hills of Tatooine.
7528560	7529360	All right.
7529360	7532240	Uh, Loki, do we have any last minute stories tonight?
7533120	7533620	No.
7534160	7534660	No.
7535200	7535840	All right.
7535840	7537280	Let's, let's see what I'm talking about.
7537280	7540400	I think someone robbing a bank with a Sonic the Hedgehog mask on.
7540400	7541600	That's not gaming news.
7542240	7543120	That's not gaming news.
7543120	7543680	That's not gaming.
7543680	7544720	That's a filler piece.
7545280	7551040	I, and I actually, actually, you know, I will say for a minute, I, I think gaming websites
7551040	7557440	and news websites that run with those types of headlines should really stop and evaluate
7557440	7561680	what is, what is the point of running with that type of headline?
7561680	7567600	Or like a story that like is like talking about a YouTube video, like a singular YouTube
7567600	7567920	video.
7567920	7571680	Like I watched a, like, for example, there was one, I saw that they talked about Doug
7571680	7576000	Doug's video where he does like silly challenges on Twitch all the time.
7576000	7581600	And one of them was like, he's going to play, um, he's going to speed run Mario Odyssey.
7581600	7587280	And every five minutes, he's going to add a HUD from a different game just to his OBS.
7587920	7589520	And he has to like, look through all that.
7590160	7592720	And it's just silly, but they wrote an article about that.
7593680	7599120	But I, I just think in particular, the whole, like, Oh, this thing happened in the real
7599120	7599600	world.
7599600	7603760	And it just like had this very loose tie to gaming culture.
7603760	7606800	I mean, gaming culture is like everywhere now.
7606800	7612960	It's like the whole thing with Mario Kart, like anyone in their forties or younger grew
7612960	7618160	up with Mario Kart and knows what Mario Kart is and played it at a birthday party at least
7618160	7619600	once in their life.
7619600	7625360	Unless, I mean, you live in a very rural and or, you know, I guess in North America, you
7625360	7628800	know, I realized the world's a big place, but you know what I mean?
7628800	7631200	Like people know that type of stuff.
7631200	7634720	So it's like somebody robbed a bank with a Sonic the Hedgehog mat.
7634720	7638320	Well, big like people rob a bank with Mickey Mouse masks on.
7638320	7640720	You don't see deadline reporting on that.
7640800	7648320	Like, it's just, I just don't, I don't understand what that absolutely has to do with gaming.
7648320	7655280	I feel like blogs and news sites try to say, Oh, look, it's like, it's proof that gaming
7655280	7657280	is out there in pop co okay.
7657280	7658080	We've been new.
7658080	7660880	Like we know, we know gaming is out there in pop culture.
7661440	7667440	Like, you don't, especially these negative things like robbing a bank, we don't need
7667440	7668320	it pointed out.
7668960	7672000	Sonic the Hedgehog gamers, they're just robbing banks.
7672000	7674720	Now it's probably that grand theft auto teaching them to do that.
7676720	7678720	Sonic the Hedgehog fast.
7678720	7685440	Sonic the Hedgehog was a highly successful movie franchise at this point and that franchise
7685440	7687440	cause they're doing more than one movie.
7687440	7689920	Like that is worth writing about.
7690480	7692960	Do we need to talk about Sonic robbing a fucking bank?
7692960	7694080	I don't think so.
7694080	7694880	It's just silly.
7695520	7699920	Uh, and Bobby in chat says, uh, yeah, they still have story quotas at Kotaku.
7699920	7703360	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, it's usually a Kotaku writer fulfilling a story quota for
7703360	7703920	the week.
7703920	7708400	Uh, yes, it's easy to pick on them, but I see a lot of other places too.
7708400	7712640	So sure we can start the conversation with Kotaku, but this is a problem all throughout
7712640	7713200	the industry.
7713200	7713840	Let's be real.
7713840	7715520	Those types of like report.
7715520	7716720	Cause, cause guess what?
7717280	7718960	Kotaku ran with that headline.
7719680	7722560	I'll bet you what there's, there's what?
7722560	7726000	Probably hundreds of active gaming podcasts right now.
7726000	7730000	I'll bet you at least a hundred of those gaming podcasts picked up that headline from Kotaku
7730000	7732000	and they're going to talk about the bank robbery with the song.
7732000	7736000	I guess we just did, but in a different context are going to talk about the article on the
7736000	7736720	show.
7736720	7740800	And my, my point is why that has nothing to do with gaming.
7742480	7746320	And I just think we need to, we just need to get above that.
7747120	7747920	It's just silly.
7748800	7753760	Uh, Zen monkey in chat says Mario and Sonic do a heist is the next switch game.
7753760	7756320	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says grand theft Mario.
7756320	7757840	See now you bitches are funny.
7757840	7761600	Like if people are going to bring it up to be funny like that, then that's different.
7761600	7764960	But you know, you know that, you know, the difference, you know.
7767040	7771840	Anyway, let's just, let's just stop talking about the, it's, it's, it's, and honestly,
7771840	7777520	it's along the same lines to me as, and this was what, just like three, four years ago,
7777600	7779040	we would have those headlines.
7779920	7788080	Uh, woman meets underage man on world of Warcraft and kidnaps him across state lines for like,
7788080	7790960	cause I know that was a thing a couple of years ago.
7790960	7798320	And it's just like, is, is that really about world of Warcraft or is that just about weird
7798320	7800880	people doing weird things and illegal things?
7802720	7804080	It's not about gaming culture.
7805040	7812080	It's just gaming is that much in our culture that now all the ugly shit in our culture,
7812080	7815360	like kidnapping, like robbing banks, et cetera, et cetera.
7817120	7820160	Is now, you know, gaming gets tied into that stuff.
7822480	7826800	Uh, pixel pockets and chat says reminds me of that headline this week.
7826800	7830640	Here's the boat that won't bring Jeff Bezos hair or wife back.
7830640	7832400	And I was like, that's Savage.
7832640	7833140	Wow.
7834640	7836800	When that's the head seat, but that's funny.
7836800	7843680	Like again, if like, we're all going to be less irritated if it's funny.
7843680	7849760	If the headline on Kotaku had been Mario and Sonic do a heist or whatever,
7849760	7852960	I probably would have never brought it up here on OLR because I would have been,
7852960	7854480	well bitch, at least it was funny.
7855040	7855540	Right.
7857600	7858100	Anyway.
7858260	7858760	Anyway.
7861860	7862100	Yeah.
7862100	7865380	E3VL says clickbait titles for sure, for sure.
7865380	7867940	And then Facebook threatens to pull out of Europe and I'm like,
7867940	7871140	why don't you just do the entirety of Europe a gigantic favor?
7872900	7875220	They won't ever have to see another clickbait headline.
7880340	7880840	Let's see.
7881380	7881860	Oh yeah.
7881860	7885620	SJ100 Matt brings up the whole Kotaku story about magfest,
7885620	7889380	where they claimed magfest refused to respond to the story.
7889380	7892180	Magfest showed the receipts that said otherwise.
7892180	7897060	Yeah, because they gave magfest like an hour to respond before they ran with the story.
7897060	7902100	And then of course they put magfest did not comment on this by a deadline time.
7902100	7906180	And it's like, girl, that's shady.
7907300	7907940	That's shady.
7907940	7911300	You need to give a company like magfest more than an hour to respond.
7911300	7911800	Come on.
7912420	7912920	Come on.
7913880	7916040	Most companies when they get any kind of correspondence
7916040	7919480	or contact are at minimum 24 hours to reply.
7919480	7919980	Yeah.
7920440	7924520	I just, and I'm not, I'm not here trying to drag the entirety of games journalism.
7924520	7927560	I'm just trying to point out, these are things we can probably do better.
7927560	7932280	These are, these are things that do, do we really need this in our, you know,
7932280	7935080	if we're, if we're gaming fans and this is gaming fandom,
7935080	7938360	do we need bank robbers in this discussion?
7938360	7939160	I don't think so.
7939800	7942360	Do we need NFTs in this discussion?
7942360	7947480	That's a fucking lutely not, but at least I understand why that's coming up because it's
7947480	7952360	in that context, it's bringing an awareness to these things that gaming executives are.
7952360	7956360	We think that, you know, they're, they're being convinced and your favorite Hollywood
7956360	7961400	celebrities like Brie Larson, Tony Hawk are getting pulled into a conference room
7961400	7965080	and getting convinced by some shill that this is the next big thing.
7965080	7966440	And they have to get in on it.
7966440	7966940	Right.
7967000	7968360	And they have to write a tweet about it.
7969240	7969740	Anyway.
7970700	7973580	Okay, I'm off my soapbox.
7973580	7974940	That's what you get when you don't email us.
7974940	7977100	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
7978140	7980380	That being said, we'll wrap up.
7981100	7985260	We'll run into everybody's final thoughts, but first I want to thank you as always for
7985260	7988540	listening to our show, whether you are here live with us on Sunday nights,
7988540	7991340	or you were listening via the podcast feed on your favorite app.
7992060	7993980	Thank you so much for doing that.
7993980	7999660	And hey, either leave us a nice review, please, or tell a friend about the show.
7999660	8002540	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice and we
8002540	8007100	want more voices in the room so we can talk constructively about the things going on in
8007100	8009260	our industry and not about bank robbers.
8010780	8012300	We'll be back next week, of course.
8012940	8017340	And then not here in two weeks as the show goes through some changes with the relocation,
8017340	8022300	but it'll still be the same old good old OLR that you know and love.
8022300	8026940	But I hope you will join us next week despite the concert bookended by that little ball
8026940	8027900	game on TV.
8030140	8030780	I think that's it.
8031340	8031980	Dark Sakura.
8032700	8033900	What is your final thought tonight?
8039740	8042060	Keep your salty shit about no way out of my end game chat.
8043660	8043980	All right.
8043980	8045180	Have fun and Debbie delight.
8045180	8046220	We'll see you in a little bit.
8046220	8046540	All right.
8047180	8048460	Why is Debbie so delightful?
8048460	8051420	She's kind of a bitch lately because she because she did Dallas.
8054700	8055500	And she's sore now.
8055500	8056300	Bye bye.
8058380	8059180	All right.
8059180	8060060	Loki, we'll go to you.
8060060	8060780	Your final thought.
8061820	8065260	Final thought is I need to work more on Minecraft.
8065260	8067180	I need to figure out some different things to do in there.
8068300	8073020	So, um, my final thought is I'll probably do like one personal stream this week, but
8073020	8075180	then I'm going to be on a little bit of a break because of the move.
8075180	8076540	I'm sure y'all can understand.
8077340	8080780	But yeah, I'm really excited to getting to a new place in a new setup.
8081740	8086860	S200 Matt, I think a good thought here too says mask up, get vaxxed and boosted, stay
8086860	8087820	home when you're sick.
8088460	8089020	Right, Loki?
8089020	8090380	You're staying home because you're sick.
8090380	8090880	Right.
8091740	8091980	Yeah.
8091980	8093260	On a serious note, feel better.
8093260	8096860	I'm sorry that happened, but I hope it's, it sounds like, has it been, it hasn't been
8096860	8097740	that bad, right?
8097740	8099100	Cause you, you got vaxxed and boosted.
8099100	8103660	So it's just been, yeah, it's been, I mean, it's been like a, just like a cold.
8103660	8106540	I mean, I don't know, like, but right now I just have that.
8106540	8108940	I mean, like the cough and phlegm phase.
8109740	8110860	So I understand.
8112300	8116060	I was wondering if I, you know, I've just had this most sore throat for like an entire
8116060	8117980	week and then that was it.
8118540	8119100	This is weird.
8119100	8119980	I don't know.
8119980	8120620	Maybe it's nothing.
8121260	8121760	All right.
8122780	8124460	That's I did take an at home test actually.
8124460	8126220	And it was negative, but I know those at home tests.
8126220	8127660	Well, here's the funny thing too.
8127660	8130380	I took an at home test too, and it was also negative.
8131260	8133500	And then you took the lab test and it was positive.
8133500	8137980	Um, well, my son took a test at school cause he had gotten a cold.
8137980	8140140	So we thought, Oh, he just had what I had.
8140780	8142700	And then he got some symptoms.
8142700	8147500	So he, we kept him up for a day or two just to, you know, until his fever went down.
8147500	8150860	And then he got back to school and he had to take a test there before they let him in.
8150860	8152780	They're like, it's positive.
8152780	8154300	I'm like, uh, dang it.
8155820	8155980	Yeah.
8155980	8162620	But the one, the ones that like, dang it, the one, the actual, the tests actually at
8162620	8165900	like the hospitals aren't as good as the at home test.
8165900	8171020	Cause the ones that the hospitals will detect it up to like 90 days after it's been in your
8171020	8171900	system.
8171900	8175820	So like, it's not a good indicator whether you have COVID still.
8175820	8180140	Um, it's just, if you've had it recently, um, but the at home tests, at least that's
8180140	8183020	those pediatricians that said the at home tests are the way to go.
8183820	8185740	I don't know, but we'll see.
8185740	8185980	All right.
8185980	8187660	Well stay safe everyone.
8187660	8192540	I mean, it does seem like it sucks Loki that we're at the, at this finish line basically
8192540	8196860	when it comes to Omicron and things are going down and lucky you, here you are.
8196860	8201100	But hopefully, hopefully this is a sign of the, the, the thing.
8201100	8205020	Cause the, you know, the long-term stuff isn't a big deal.
8205020	8205340	Yeah.
8205340	8205580	Yeah.
8205580	8207100	Here's hoping fingers and toes crossed.
8207660	8207900	All right.
8207900	8208620	That's it everyone.
8208620	8211340	We'll be back in seven days for episode 903.
8211340	8212300	Happy gaming everyone.
8212300	8213020	Have a great week.
8213020	8213740	We'll see you next time.
8213740	8216460	Hey, next week we get to celebrate one year of Pixel Poops.
8216460	8217980	So tune in next week for that.
8217980	8219740	The actual one year anniversary.
8219740	8220620	Uh, good night everybody.
8220620	8221500	We'll see you next time.
8221500	8222220	Uh, have a good one.
8223580	8223900	Oops.
8224780	8230140	Maybe it would help if I hit the right button that says credits and not classic game B roll.
8230140	8231260	Let's try that again.
8231260	8232140	Good night everybody.
8232940	8235660	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
