00:00.000 --> 00:13.160
My favorite headline this week involves the current arcade machine renaissance. Those

00:13.160 --> 00:16.800
that want an actual cabinet can get them, those that want a fractional scale model but

00:16.800 --> 00:21.880
visually identical version can, and innovators can do fun, unique things too. Like NBA Jam

00:21.880 --> 00:25.920
Shack Edition. Despite only ever playing as the Chicago Bulls and NBA Jam, reading about

00:25.920 --> 00:30.080
this still put a smile on my face. This is just one larger than life story. Now it's

00:30.080 --> 00:33.440
time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the

00:33.440 --> 00:36.720
rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:41.840 --> 00:47.680
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. Another week of the show where

00:47.680 --> 00:54.960
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number

00:55.040 --> 01:03.520
903 of our show for tonight, February the 13th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined by

01:03.520 --> 01:10.960
my co-hosts at the keyboard at the moment. Say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. Hi Loki,

01:10.960 --> 01:18.160
how are you doing? It's somewhat pain but I'm okay. Oh no, all right I want to ask about that

01:18.160 --> 01:23.760
but quickly I just want to say DarkSakura is here. She had a cooking mama emergency in the other

01:23.760 --> 01:29.840
room. So don't worry, Sakura is fixing it right now with the cooking. She'll be right back. So

01:30.720 --> 01:37.280
but the pre-show video thing ended. I was gonna let it go like another minute and I was like well

01:37.280 --> 01:42.320
this is awkward. I guess I'll just start the show. The joys of being here live because of course we

01:42.320 --> 01:46.880
do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the

01:46.880 --> 01:51.920
Bobby Black Wolf show. Not tonight though. Bobby Black Wolf is enjoying seven layer bean dip with

01:51.920 --> 01:56.880
friends tonight. Oh hello there's DarkSakura back from cooking mama emergency. Hey DarkSakura.

01:57.520 --> 02:05.120
Hey. Hey did mama fix it? My couscous actually burned a little bit on my pot so since it was

02:05.120 --> 02:11.520
a very expensive enamel dutch oven. I had to get that scrubbed real quick before I put it in the

02:11.520 --> 02:16.320
in the dishwasher. Thankfully I can dish wash it. It's fine but I had to get the burnt couscous.

02:16.320 --> 02:22.480
But for people on camera I have chicken and carrot and black truffle and onion

02:23.120 --> 02:27.920
and couscous with my homemade broth and I've added cheese because that's what you do.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.520
Did you bring enough for everyone?

02:31.360 --> 02:34.800
You should see how much I have. I have two containers of it in the fridge. I mean I used

02:34.800 --> 02:41.520
all my couscous thinking oh this will make a little bit no no it made it made a lot.

02:41.520 --> 02:47.360
I would say I'm coming over but things are a little busy with my move going on right now so

02:47.360 --> 02:52.720
I've been talking about it for oh go ahead. Well if you want something to eat like on

02:52.720 --> 02:58.320
Thursday I'm sure there'll be some left because Dan won't won't eat the couscous. I made it all

02:58.320 --> 03:03.280
for me so I'll bring you some couscous. I've been talking about it for a few weeks on the show but

03:03.280 --> 03:10.000
I am moving so Bobby it's interesting Bobby's not here tonight because of friends and chips

03:10.000 --> 03:14.960
and traditions and things like that. The Owl show. Yeah the Owl show is on well actually I

03:14.960 --> 03:18.720
hear there was a really decent halftime show I didn't I didn't catch it but I heard it was

03:18.720 --> 03:23.200
pretty good so um so I guess there's that there's that that's usually the way it is there's a really

03:23.200 --> 03:27.440
cool concert that happens once a year and then there's this little football game that they play

03:27.440 --> 03:31.680
before and after it so apparently the concert kind of lived up to it this year so. Who cares

03:31.680 --> 03:37.600
about sports ball? I know some people do whatever I find it's more traditions for a lot of people

03:37.600 --> 03:44.560
but anyway uh so Bobby's not here tonight we won't be here next week because uh I'm moving

03:44.560 --> 03:48.480
uh and I've been talking about this for a few weeks on the show so technically this is the

03:48.480 --> 03:54.160
last night in studio N7. I haven't taken down any of the decorations yet um that'll probably be

03:54.160 --> 04:00.400
tomorrow um but uh yeah uh this this studio we've been using this probably for the last seven years

04:00.400 --> 04:04.320
I think is about as long as I've lived here and so it's interesting because the studio space saw

04:04.320 --> 04:10.960
the end of our run on shoutcast which was audio only and um saw the beginning of twitch

04:10.960 --> 04:16.240
uh for video which is funny because this space wasn't really set up for twitch but we made it

04:16.240 --> 04:21.120
work and uh here we are now taping virtually which is what we're going to continue to do

04:21.120 --> 04:27.440
uh in two weeks when we come back uh with our next episode uh where my my setup will change

04:27.440 --> 04:31.680
drastically from what you see tonight I'm not exactly sure what it will look like yet but I

04:31.680 --> 04:37.280
will say that Alan and I got to go to the house and actually see everything this week and it was

04:37.280 --> 04:42.080
it was really cool I'm getting more and more excited so uh very very cool um I do want to

04:42.080 --> 04:46.480
welcome those of you in our chat room and and big uh thank you as I see the hype train going on in

04:46.480 --> 04:51.520
chat right now thank you so much to all of our live folks that are that are here despite the

04:51.520 --> 04:56.320
concert and game on tv right now uh you all are here and super appreciate that but of course if

04:56.320 --> 05:01.680
you listen on our podcast feed uh we appreciate that as well uh I want to go back to Loki real

05:01.680 --> 05:05.520
quick before we get into the kickoff topic because I didn't I didn't catch what's playing behind you

05:05.520 --> 05:11.920
tonight it looks like a Zelda game but like a DS thing what's what is what is that which which game

05:11.920 --> 05:23.200
is it I can't tell from this far back is that is it Minish Cap no no which one it's Spirit Tracks

05:23.200 --> 05:30.080
oh okay all right what made you say I did Dr Hatta well because the the DS Zelda games are

05:30.080 --> 05:36.160
awesome and they really should bring them to the switch um like I mean when we're talking about

05:36.160 --> 05:42.320
like how like oh yes it would be completely ruined if we brought like a game that Nintendo made to

05:42.320 --> 05:50.560
mobile like Mario um whereas I think actually Zelda would work very well because it worked

05:50.560 --> 05:58.720
well in the DS it was mainly using the stylus and so I that is a possibility I still wouldn't

05:58.720 --> 06:02.400
want to see them come to mobile just put them on the switch but like you know it would still be

06:02.400 --> 06:09.280
kind of cool yeah um going to our chat uh over twitch.tv slash vog network pod culture says uh

06:09.280 --> 06:18.000
ah no more live shows ever never say never never say never ever uh on that note uh yeah Loki

06:18.000 --> 06:22.880
brought up Nintendo uh and Zelda so I think we should probably talk about the big surprise

06:23.520 --> 06:29.600
never say never to a new Nintendo Direct because once again we had no idea it was coming and then

06:29.600 --> 06:34.480
you know in the middle of the week they said bam you're gonna get a new Nintendo Direct tomorrow

06:34.480 --> 06:39.280
and uh it happened and I gotta say we'll recap everything they talked about but I've gotta say

06:39.280 --> 06:44.720
um I couldn't watch it live which was a bummer um I just had work obligations which you know work is

06:44.720 --> 06:50.320
more important um so I had to take care of that and then I was gonna watch it like on stream

06:50.320 --> 06:56.560
delayed to get reactions but um I got twit or uh twitter notifications pushed to my phone that kind

06:56.560 --> 07:02.960
of spoiled the big news uh so I was like all right I guess I'll just read up on it so I admittedly I

07:02.960 --> 07:08.480
never watched the Nintendo Direct I just saw the bullet points but it still sounded like it was

07:08.480 --> 07:13.920
a pretty action-packed good direct uh for all things considered it was I saw some folks online

07:13.920 --> 07:18.560
that were very meh about it which kind of surprised me I thought there was a lot of good

07:18.560 --> 07:23.520
stuff in it um but let's let's talk about some of the big headlines that were in the direct uh do

07:23.520 --> 07:28.960
you have it up Loki you want me to talk about it yeah so it was it was all right I mean there was

07:28.960 --> 07:33.760
some big announcements I guess there's a lot of games I just don't play the series of so it's not

07:33.760 --> 07:40.000
like you know I was super hyped about things but you know overall they had some stuff I'm interested

07:40.000 --> 07:46.400
in yeah there's lots of like interesting things on there like Chrono Cross yeah that's it's

07:46.400 --> 07:50.400
interesting to see that and there's the Tel Aviv stuff that they have for that as well which is

07:50.400 --> 07:56.240
kind of neat um you know that one was rumored you know for all the crap we get about reporting on

07:56.240 --> 08:01.280
rumors sometimes that Chrono Cross I remember was a thing like four weeks ago because we were

08:01.280 --> 08:05.360
wondering why are they doing Chrono Cross and they won't touch Chrono Trigger I remember that

08:05.360 --> 08:11.120
discussion coming up a few weeks ago on the show um so uh it does seem like those Square Enix

08:11.120 --> 08:16.800
remasters of like Secret of Mana you know and so forth are bringing fruit although I guess Chrono

08:16.800 --> 08:23.120
Cross is not really a remaster it's just kind of repackaged for the Switch I suppose and I would

08:23.120 --> 08:29.520
bet mobile I don't think they're gonna only have it on the Switch it's gotta be for mobile as well

08:29.520 --> 08:36.720
because that's been Square's mo lately so yeah so they um showed off a Fire Emblem Three Houses

08:36.720 --> 08:44.560
um Musou game so they've got Fire Emblem uh Warriors I guess or three yeah Fire Emblem

08:44.560 --> 08:50.160
Warriors Three Hopes so I believe that's the sequel to the last game that they had come out

08:50.160 --> 08:56.480
I feel like those Warriors games do pretty well on the Switch like you know obviously the um Hyrule

08:56.480 --> 09:02.960
Warriors you know has done very well on the Switch there's the Persona one I'm just so sick

09:02.960 --> 09:09.520
of Fire Emblem but you know some people like it so it's fine well I think what's it's gonna be

09:09.520 --> 09:16.000
a completely different style for Fire Emblem too so you know I think I think it it works for the

09:16.000 --> 09:24.320
Musou type of you know game so I think it'll be fun um what else so uh No Man's Sky is coming to

09:24.320 --> 09:29.120
the Switch that's pretty interesting to see that actually happening I've been asked about my

09:29.120 --> 09:33.280
thoughts on this one because I'm kind of the resident No Man's Sky fanboy a little bit um

09:33.280 --> 09:38.400
and uh I mean it's I'm I'm all for more people getting exposed to the game and there are people

09:38.400 --> 09:43.440
that will get to play it on Switch who haven't played it on other platforms yet um and I know

09:43.440 --> 09:49.600
a lot of the concern is is it gonna run on the Switch it'll run on the Switch I mean it runs on

09:49.600 --> 09:56.240
an OG Playstation 4 and an OG Xbox One it doesn't run very well um I would imagine they're gonna be

09:56.240 --> 10:00.880
targeting a lower resolution especially when the game is handheld um so they'll probably be able

10:00.880 --> 10:06.800
to do some things but I I I it's not gonna be ideal I don't think it's gonna be the ideal way

10:06.800 --> 10:13.840
to play No Man's Sky unless your gaming is largely portable if you take transit a lot or you know you

10:13.840 --> 10:18.720
just happen to play Switch in portable mode then hey having the No Man's Sky experience portable

10:18.720 --> 10:23.600
will be kind of nice but I I don't think it'll be the optimal way to play it but I'm all for

10:23.600 --> 10:28.560
more people um coming on board and I hope it retains the cross-play functionality

10:28.560 --> 10:37.440
um because it'll be one of those few games uh that play across Sony, PC, Microsoft and Switch

10:37.440 --> 10:43.920
so it'd be be pretty cool um we have a new Mario Strikers game so that's Mario Strikers

10:43.920 --> 10:49.200
Battle League that's coming out in June 10th which looked kind of cool um those are that's

10:49.200 --> 10:53.520
the series I don't really care about but cool yeah as we mentioned uh Chrome of Cross the

10:53.520 --> 11:03.280
remasters coming to Switch on April 7th um there was the announcement of Mother and Earthbound

11:03.280 --> 11:09.760
being added to Nintendo Switch online so for the NES and SNES finally I'm alive

11:10.640 --> 11:18.720
makes me happy yeah Live Alive that's getting uh ported and remastered on the Switch uh which is

11:18.720 --> 11:24.880
pretty awesome and I have like voice acting in there and stuff I'm just gonna say Live Alive

11:24.880 --> 11:32.000
I think was the biggest and best news in the entire Direct. I'm gonna say why I think the

11:32.000 --> 11:38.400
Live Alive was the biggest and best news it's because unlike the Chrono Cross one and some

11:38.400 --> 11:44.720
of the other things we've seen Square Enix do and I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of toot on something

11:44.720 --> 11:53.680
I said months ago on this show we're seeing Square leverage that um Octopath Traveler

11:53.680 --> 12:00.080
slash Triangle Strategy Engine for something really different now and I remember I remember

12:00.080 --> 12:04.560
when I brought this up it was when I was reviewing that game Dungeon Encounters remember when that

12:04.560 --> 12:08.800
came out um a couple months it was by the uh minds behind Final Fantasy 12 kind of created

12:08.800 --> 12:14.560
this very minimalistic RPG um and some people are super into it and I I just I liked it but

12:14.560 --> 12:19.040
I didn't understand why it had to be minimalistic and I said they've got this engine why aren't they

12:19.040 --> 12:23.360
using this engine to build more things and that kind of went into the talk about what if the

12:23.360 --> 12:28.800
Final Fantasy remasters ended up in this engine or something like that you met right but well

12:29.360 --> 12:36.000
it's not Final Fantasy remaster but I feel like it's something adjacent is now going into this

12:36.000 --> 12:43.280
engine and I think that's really exciting um and I you know between that and the Chrono Cross news

12:43.280 --> 12:48.720
I think we should all cross our fingers cross our toes hold our breath that that's why Chrono

12:48.720 --> 12:53.760
Trigger is taking so long that Chrono Trigger is going to like maybe Live Alive is like a test

12:53.760 --> 12:58.000
to kind of port these sorts of games over and maybe Chrono Trigger is going to get the Triangle

12:58.000 --> 13:04.080
Strategy Octopath treatment um you know I know it's a it's a wild theory but I just think that

13:04.080 --> 13:08.960
that was the most exciting news I think out of the whole direct I I it's interesting I know people

13:08.960 --> 13:15.040
that really love that game um I I must admit I I know of it I don't I'm not very familiar with it

13:15.040 --> 13:19.840
so it is you know especially for those of us in this you know in the states and you know North

13:19.840 --> 13:25.120
America who have never uh really experienced that before except through a translated ROM it's almost

13:25.120 --> 13:30.320
like it's a new product of sorts but I I think you know it's it's neat that Square is digging

13:30.320 --> 13:35.920
into the vaults meanwhile Nintendo kind of does the bare minimum of finally putting their Earthbound

13:35.920 --> 13:40.480
ROMs up on the service don't get me wrong I'm happy I'm thrilled for that that's great but of

13:40.480 --> 13:46.800
course we're all sitting here going Mother 3 when and everyone's like and they're like nope and even

13:46.800 --> 13:51.840
the Earthbound creator was out there on Twitter going I didn't know this was going to happen I'm

13:51.840 --> 13:56.240
really happy that folks are getting to play this yeah I'd love to see Earthbound 3 happen too

13:56.240 --> 14:00.800
you know is in this and then of course I'm sure Reggie was fucking teasing Earthbound 3 as always

14:00.800 --> 14:07.200
or Mother 3 excuse me as always so it's just silly I'm glad I'm glad the um I'm glad the games

14:07.200 --> 14:10.960
are finally where they need to be I'm glad they didn't put it on the plus version of the service

14:10.960 --> 14:18.480
or anything stupid like that and I'm really glad about Live Alive yeah um some other announcements

14:18.480 --> 14:23.040
that they had so they have um some collections coming to the Switch they're getting ported over

14:23.040 --> 14:28.400
so there's a portal companion collection which is portal one and two uh there's also the Klonoa

14:28.400 --> 14:34.320
series that's getting ported over as well uh front mission first is a remake of the first front

14:34.320 --> 14:39.120
mission game that's going to be coming out on the Switch as well uh they showed off a trailer for

14:39.120 --> 14:46.320
the salmon run next wave which is part of Splatoon 3 uh what else oh and Splatoon 3 is this summer

14:46.320 --> 14:52.240
I didn't know I didn't expect we'd get it that fast to be honest yeah this summer um they showed

14:52.240 --> 14:58.960
off a new trailer for Kirby and the forgotten land um so that looked funny with the uh mouthful mode

14:59.760 --> 15:06.320
and what else a new trailer for triangle strategy uh which is kind of less exciting after the Live

15:06.320 --> 15:12.800
Alive announcement then um some of the bigger stuff so now we're getting a Wii sports kind of

15:12.800 --> 15:19.280
sequel with Nintendo Switch Sports which I could have done without their demonstration of

15:19.280 --> 15:27.040
volleyball but um cool well this is that game where it's like of course like this is what we

15:27.040 --> 15:31.760
should have had at the beginning instead of one two switch and it's kind of surprising you know

15:31.760 --> 15:37.040
especially with how huge Wii Sports was and you know and in my brain I went boy they really should

15:37.040 --> 15:44.160
have done this for the Wii U and I neglect oh they did oops but the Wii U kind of fizzled out

15:44.160 --> 15:49.840
that fast I completely forgot and I think most people did let's be real so it's it I mean this

15:49.840 --> 15:55.280
is one of Nintendo's biggest titles it's weird to think about but it is so it's nice that Nintendo

15:55.280 --> 15:59.440
Switch is finally like getting its due with and it's one of those things where it's like oh of

15:59.440 --> 16:04.160
course they had to announce this someday like this seems very logical that we'd get here at some

16:04.160 --> 16:08.720
point I just really wanted to get some comments from chat real quick Mike Deft is talking about

16:08.720 --> 16:13.840
Klonoa which I know Dark Sakura was excited about too and Mike Deft says yeah the Klonoa 1 is

16:13.840 --> 16:19.680
running on the same base they used for the Wii remake but they're using the old models Klonoa 2

16:19.680 --> 16:24.880
looks like a simple remaster which I'm fine with I'm so happy we got Klonoa again and Dark Sakura

16:24.880 --> 16:32.000
I'm sure you echo that a little bit as well uh for getting Klonoa yeah um speaking of uh stuff

16:32.000 --> 16:36.880
also being ported over I forgot about the uh Force Unleashed is being ported over from it's

16:36.880 --> 16:41.680
the Wii version that they're bringing to the Switch which looks it's really showing its age um

16:42.880 --> 16:47.520
what else uh so other bigger announcements Xenoblade Chronicles 3 coming to the Switch

16:47.520 --> 16:53.120
in September looks amazing another one of those oh of course this would happen at some point I

16:53.120 --> 16:57.760
think for me I was more uh impressed with the speed I mean this is something I wouldn't have

16:57.760 --> 17:02.640
expected for a couple years but um actually it came up in Discord I uh I shared that comment

17:02.640 --> 17:07.600
over on our Discord over at vognetwork.com discord I was kind of talking about that and somebody

17:07.600 --> 17:12.720
did say you know the the chatter is that they actually started two and three around the same

17:12.720 --> 17:17.440
time um kind of knowing they were gonna make a trilogy the whole time so this has just been sort

17:17.440 --> 17:24.000
of um you know finished up after two released basically so we got the news that there's probably

17:24.000 --> 17:29.680
not going to be a new Mario Kart 9 until at least 2024 that's because Mario Kart 8 is getting more

17:29.680 --> 17:37.680
DLC 48 new tracks that have been ported over from a remastered I guess from other Mario Kart games

17:37.680 --> 17:44.480
including Mario Kart Tour which is the mobile game so those are going to be coming this year

17:44.480 --> 17:52.160
and in next year and it's like $25 for the DLC and of course they're throwing that into the

17:52.160 --> 17:59.360
expansion pass as well but smart um not a bad deal for 48 tracks over the course of you know

18:00.000 --> 18:06.640
few years but yeah I also I see it as them trying to sweeten the pot with their expansion pass

18:06.640 --> 18:12.560
I think I think they're overcharging for what it is quite honestly especially with no new characters

18:12.560 --> 18:17.120
I think they're really trying to push people to that pass because now yeah they've got that

18:17.120 --> 18:21.920
they've got of course the Genesis and you know that the Nintendo 64 stuff and then they got the

18:21.920 --> 18:26.160
Animal Crossing right so I think they're really trying to push yeah why can't they do more

18:26.160 --> 18:30.480
characters like that I'm surprised that they're not doing that I don't know you know have you seen

18:30.480 --> 18:35.840
a lot of the um you know discourse about that the tracks didn't look great in the preview some folks

18:35.840 --> 18:40.000
thought they were kind of playing well they were like this they were at least the one example they

18:40.000 --> 18:43.840
were showing like they completely changed the way it looks and it looks a lot more simpler

18:44.560 --> 18:50.720
from you know it's not as nice looking as even the mobile version which I'm kind of surprised

18:50.720 --> 18:55.440
well I mean to some extent like I understand a map like what Chaco Mountain was on there right

18:55.440 --> 19:00.000
from the N64 I think that we saw caught a glimpse of that it looked all right yeah but I mean but if

19:00.000 --> 19:05.040
you think about it the N64 that's the problem when you kind of upskill a lot of those old maps they

19:05.040 --> 19:09.680
were playing because the N64 could only handle so much I don't think they were necessarily referring

19:09.680 --> 19:14.800
to the Nintendo 64 stuff I think they're talking about the Mario Kart Tour maps um being kind of

19:14.800 --> 19:20.320
like downscaled almost um I think the stuff the retro tracks are obviously going to look better

19:20.400 --> 19:25.360
because they're based off older versions of the game and they have a lot more room to add detail

19:25.360 --> 19:30.800
and stuff to it so it'll make it look nicer but when you take something from Mario Kart Tour which

19:30.800 --> 19:35.120
is probably running I don't really know how well the mobile game runs or what the hardware

19:35.120 --> 19:40.800
requirements are for that but like you know it probably has some better fidelity to it and a

19:40.800 --> 19:45.440
little bit more detail in the models and stuff in the tracks and so they're probably not able to

19:45.440 --> 19:50.560
pull that down into the switch and maintain a good frame rate so they're obviously going to

19:50.560 --> 19:56.720
make some you know alterations that kind of do that and we're talking about like what it looks

19:56.720 --> 20:04.160
like based off of an early shot that you know who knows when this is coming out and it's just like

20:04.160 --> 20:10.720
a few second clips so it's very subjective right now um I think it's interesting though

20:10.720 --> 20:15.360
especially with all the rumors about Mario Kart 9 which obviously I mean it could have been people

20:16.000 --> 20:22.960
switch I agree HD yeah it's it'll be a launch title yeah Mario the next Mario Kart is going

20:22.960 --> 20:28.160
to be for whatever Nintendo's successor to the Switch is it's going to be the next console I

20:28.160 --> 20:33.840
think at this point Mario Kart 8 is kind of like the full life of the Switch and uh I think Mario

20:33.840 --> 20:38.160
Kart 8 again and we'll just make Mario Kart infinity we'll turn the eight sideways you know

20:38.160 --> 20:44.080
well honestly I think we'd all love a Mario Kart game that just encompasses every single track

20:44.080 --> 20:48.880
right take the Smash Brothers get in there how many how many tracks are left take the Smash

20:48.880 --> 20:54.240
Smash Brothers approach everyone is here right every character and every track from a prior game

20:54.240 --> 20:58.800
why not seriously think about that because like if you look at it you know a lot of the tracks

20:58.800 --> 21:02.720
in some of the other games I don't remember when they started recycling tracks a little

21:02.720 --> 21:08.240
maybe that's DS um but like there's a lot of the other games have just tracks from other

21:08.240 --> 21:14.800
titles in there like I can't imagine that we're left with many unique tracks from you know

21:15.840 --> 21:22.880
just in general and also why can't they just make new tracks you know well did they say every track

21:22.880 --> 21:28.160
was recycled or are people in every track because no it's what they said I thought there was still

21:28.160 --> 21:33.280
room for new tracks interesting I mean they still could put more DLC out there I think that they

21:33.280 --> 21:37.600
should put the pass out for the tracks and maybe have like some additional characters or something

21:37.600 --> 21:43.040
that they should throw in there like I don't know I would have thought that maybe since Mario Kart

21:43.040 --> 21:47.600
Tour kind of ended up fizzling maybe there were some planned things for that that they would push

21:47.600 --> 21:52.480
over that's where I thought they might squeeze some new tracks from but I guess not interesting

21:53.520 --> 22:01.280
all right anything else um no that's I think it I'm trying to think back if there's any other

22:01.280 --> 22:06.320
announcements that they kind of showed off there was like some updates for Metroid Dread that's

22:06.320 --> 22:10.480
going to be coming out so they have a few different difficulty modes basically a one hit

22:10.480 --> 22:16.560
kill one hit death mode that's going to be a dread mode that's coming out soon and then also they're

22:16.560 --> 22:21.040
having an easier mode that's in there as well and then they're going to be adding later on a boss

22:21.040 --> 22:25.680
rush mode that's going to be coming I'm glad to hear that Metroid's getting a Bobby Black Wolf

22:25.680 --> 22:30.320
mode that's great yeah yeah and then they showed off a new trailer for Advance Wars 1 and 2

22:31.120 --> 22:38.480
reboot camp that's coming out on April 8th the only thing I wanted to comment on that I didn't

22:38.480 --> 22:44.320
catch was the portal so they're doing like portal 2 on the switch basically I thought it was portal

22:44.320 --> 22:50.000
one and two is a one and two well yeah it sounds like kind of a repackaging of the games which

22:50.000 --> 22:54.320
you know those I mean don't get me wrong I love portal I love that series it's cool that it's

22:54.320 --> 22:59.280
portable but it's also like who hasn't played it at this point but you know what would be neat

22:59.280 --> 23:07.200
about it and I didn't see this to the point but there were also those fan released level edits

23:07.200 --> 23:14.480
that I thought they went back and put on steam and it would be nice if the switch version included

23:14.480 --> 23:19.760
those well what struck me as odd is that you know of course there's that whole like yay let's get

23:19.760 --> 23:27.680
uh portal portable but we have the steam deck so it seems weird that valve is lending portal over

23:27.680 --> 23:33.600
to the Nintendo switch when I don't think so I mean but portal would still be a great reason to

23:33.600 --> 23:38.720
get a steam deck it's just interesting that valve is doing that that's all portal portal is old no

23:38.720 --> 23:44.240
one's going to get a steam deck for portal yeah true I guess there's that I mean on top of that

23:44.240 --> 23:51.920
how many different versions of the orange box do they put out and you know I I it should have been

23:51.920 --> 23:58.160
the orange box well portal portal 2 has been released on everything and then they've had all

23:58.160 --> 24:03.040
the the edits and everything portal 2 right now is old enough that it's not going to be a steam

24:03.040 --> 24:09.600
deck seller what would be a steam deck seller is being able to have you know some of the current

24:09.600 --> 24:15.600
biggest games that will work on the steam deck from multiple publishers that's what's going to

24:15.600 --> 24:23.600
sell a steam deck or for people you know like me who uh doesn't have exactly a pc capable you know

24:23.600 --> 24:28.800
system although I've worked around it and I don't need a steam deck now but that's what's going to

24:28.800 --> 24:33.920
sell a steam deck um I don't think portal 2 is is remotely going to be in the ballpark of it

24:33.920 --> 24:39.760
sorry interesting pod culture and chat says well I and to to be clear I'm not exactly saying like

24:39.760 --> 24:43.920
oh god people are getting steam decks just for portal but I just think it's interesting

24:43.920 --> 24:50.880
that valve is giving an exclusive to nintendo at this same time that they have a console

24:50.880 --> 24:55.120
now that they're putting out basically that could benefit from all sorts of exclusives

24:55.120 --> 25:00.560
so additional sales it's not even really I mean it's like it's it's a game that came out on the

25:00.560 --> 25:07.440
xbox 360 you know that several years ago yeah I I'm not sure there's a huge audience for this to

25:07.440 --> 25:12.560
begin with except for the fact that I and I think this is the reality too and something we all have

25:12.560 --> 25:18.880
to kind of just is that there are going to be kids out there that were eight when portal two

25:18.880 --> 25:24.400
first came out that are now approaching 20 uh that maybe are going to be playing these games

25:24.400 --> 25:29.040
for the first time because they were a little young for it the first time I think there's

25:29.040 --> 25:34.560
I think that's where the audience for these games are quite honestly as shona matt says don't say

25:34.560 --> 25:41.520
that rob sorry I it is what it is I really think that's where the audience is um pod culture says

25:41.520 --> 25:47.920
portal three would be a steam deck seller now that would that would be too easy for valve to do

25:47.920 --> 25:52.480
but it wouldn't be just on steam though it would be on and we know that they can't count to three

25:52.480 --> 25:57.200
anyway well that is true how long did it take capcom to learn how to count to three

25:58.320 --> 26:04.000
a long time but yes steam deck is not isolated in its own world but still even just the fact

26:04.000 --> 26:10.160
that portal three you know all these years later is still not a thing is interesting to me but it

26:10.160 --> 26:17.360
is what it is valve has their plan I guess so all right well I I thought it was a very solid

26:17.360 --> 26:22.080
nintendo direct at the end of the day um a lot of good announcements I thought there was some

26:22.080 --> 26:27.520
really good surprises in there especially the live alive and you know chrono cross and just

26:27.520 --> 26:32.880
clano a lot of good stuff coming back and a lot of um you know forward-looking stuff I think the

26:32.880 --> 26:38.480
mario kart tracks was kind of a surprise um splatoon 3 not being holiday but paying for

26:38.480 --> 26:44.720
their service I mean like I know it I know it's like kind of stupid just to buy it outright but

26:44.720 --> 26:49.280
I'm going to buy it out right I'm not supporting that expansion pass service yeah I'm I'm still on

26:49.280 --> 26:53.520
the fence I mean honestly I'm not playing enough mario kart 8 I'm not sure I would even get the

26:53.520 --> 27:00.640
tracks it's I'm on I'm on jds plan so I spent so little on it anyway that it doesn't matter

27:00.640 --> 27:05.200
there you go all right well let's talk about the types of things that we are playing this

27:05.200 --> 27:10.400
week nintendo switch or otherwise in how was your gaming week so uh we'll start with dark

27:10.400 --> 27:15.920
sakura how was your gaming week what do you been playing this week I played stuff um of course dead

27:15.920 --> 27:22.560
by daylight um they've disabled nurse which is kind of uh weird for me because I said after rank

27:22.560 --> 27:30.160
reset which is what today yesterday today yeah that my plan was to go back and practice nurse

27:30.160 --> 27:36.880
a lot more um although what I'm also doing is uh I've got my first p350 which is freddy

27:37.680 --> 27:45.440
oh congrats um and I finally decided to prestige pig um so now I am doing nothing but putting all

27:45.440 --> 27:52.160
of my points on um in in uh miss pigu so that I can uh uh make her my second p350

27:53.360 --> 27:58.880
and for those who don't know um every time you hit 50 you can prestige but you can only

27:58.880 --> 28:04.560
prestige three times and then you get another achievement when you hit 50 on prestige level

28:04.560 --> 28:09.280
three I've also figured out how to rip the models from dead by daylight now and import them into

28:09.280 --> 28:16.400
blender I saw you tweeting some of this stuff it was interesting yeah they actually redid pig's

28:16.400 --> 28:23.520
face when they put out the new cosmetics so before that um her face was just sort of like almost kind

28:23.520 --> 28:31.120
of flat and now um she actually like like for the the head actually goes with that outfit that I

28:31.120 --> 28:36.720
have on her there's a different head for the mask uh you know the mask with the bear trap crown

28:36.720 --> 28:41.840
right uh mask the bear trap crown has like a sort of a shaded kind of like under the batman mask

28:41.840 --> 28:48.400
sort of makeup thing her regular face is all covered in blood um which she didn't even get

28:48.400 --> 28:52.160
that bloody in the real movies hell even when she got shot in the neck she didn't get that bloody

28:52.640 --> 28:59.760
um so uh I I thought it was really really interesting um I still haven't figured out how

28:59.760 --> 29:05.760
to get the the skeletons imported right so that I can use some other animation stuff but really

29:05.760 --> 29:12.800
my goal is just a converter to a uh a v tube thing anyway um and I'm going to be trying to edit the

29:12.800 --> 29:19.280
the face mesh to uh to look a little bit more realistic I'm going to stylize it quite a bit

29:19.280 --> 29:25.040
but right now I've got my first work done and I'm also going to rip uh a meg in the pig mask

29:25.040 --> 29:33.200
so I don't have to animate her face interesting okay so um actually I tried to apply Jill's face

29:33.200 --> 29:42.960
to to pig and the survivor's heads are a little bit smaller so um the eye holes are like here

29:43.680 --> 29:48.400
like right where normal eyes are and then like the actual eyeballs just so you know oh is it

29:48.400 --> 29:54.800
yeah oh crap okay sorry so the eyes would be like right here um you know we're normal the eye holes

29:54.800 --> 29:59.520
would be there but like the eyeballs themselves since the eyeballs are part of the face mesh

30:00.160 --> 30:06.080
are like under uh like where the cheekbone would be whereas you know amandas are like right in the

30:06.080 --> 30:12.640
right place so I kind of need to figure out how to I haven't done mesh editing except for like

30:12.640 --> 30:18.080
v tube studio which is really simple so this is going to be a test of my skills so wish me luck

30:18.960 --> 30:27.040
but my eventual goal is to get Jill's face um applied over amanda's uh uh mask

30:28.000 --> 30:35.280
so that at least it's a decent looking face so anyway um and going I also need to double check

30:35.280 --> 30:40.240
what uh what eye color Shawnee had the I forgot her last name but she was the actress that played

30:40.240 --> 30:46.560
Amanda and Saul so I need to look up her eye color and make sure that there's the right one so anyway

30:46.560 --> 30:51.360
um going though to other games I've been playing of course I did Fantasian which I have Fantasian

30:51.360 --> 30:59.920
Friday and uh I had to restart on a couple of things um and I also started doing a retro stream

30:59.920 --> 31:06.240
on Saturday night after work and I played The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past and I have

31:06.240 --> 31:12.000
lost a lot of skills in that game because I haven't played it in 10 years so and he was like oh where

31:12.000 --> 31:15.200
was this shit where was that shit do I get this or no I can't get the Zora thing because I need to

31:15.200 --> 31:21.760
get the glove and so I'm on to getting the glove although I finished the first palace um I always

31:21.760 --> 31:28.160
never know what to call what was his name like Sahasrallah the the old man so I call him

31:28.160 --> 31:35.840
Sarsaparilla that works I call him Scheherazade once but Dan and I do that is like if we find

31:35.840 --> 31:39.920
someone with a kind of a complicated name even though we can pronounce it we still kind of screw

31:39.920 --> 31:48.960
it up um and then uh I actually have a translated copy of Live Alive that I intended to start

31:49.680 --> 32:01.200
until the direct came out um the timing so right um and I also uh played Radiant Silver Gun

32:01.200 --> 32:10.560
for Saturn fun on my Mac oh fun yeah I um I've managed to get PC Engine and Saturn games

32:10.560 --> 32:16.400
and I think I might be able to get a Playstation 1 to work next I'm still trying to find Robit

32:16.400 --> 32:23.440
Lundu which I would prefer to have an original of mine but you know I'll play it any way I can

32:23.440 --> 32:29.440
games like older than some people I know um and then of course you know I played wordscapes

32:29.440 --> 32:37.920
because that's what I do and just yeah watching friends play stuff trying to see what's interesting

32:37.920 --> 32:43.840
you know some people are playing that Lost Ark I can't play it so oh and of course Mass Effect 2

32:43.840 --> 32:51.440
which I was able to get running in my uh my parallels oh fun so I also got my uh my

32:51.440 --> 32:58.080
SteelSeries controller working yay my old one my Nimbus I'm sad I missed your um retro stream I was

32:58.480 --> 33:03.280
hosting like my gaming week is a little thin because I was hosting um show shows are starting

33:03.280 --> 33:08.560
to come back um with precautions but I was hosting uh last night or yeah last night was

33:08.560 --> 33:12.800
Rocky Horror and then two nights ago was a burlesque variety thing so I was very busy

33:13.440 --> 33:17.920
out doing that but I know why you uh messaged me that you were gonna do it I was like oh darn

33:17.920 --> 33:21.200
uh I would have watched while I was packing boxes if I wasn't out and about so

33:22.000 --> 33:25.520
well I'm kind of getting to the point where I'm just gonna throw up the cheats on it just because

33:25.520 --> 33:30.160
really I'm playing it for the experience of playing the game and yeah I don't care I I'm

33:30.160 --> 33:36.480
at least using the save states because you know when you die you start over and there's one battle

33:36.480 --> 33:41.200
that even when I was super good at the game still always gave me problems and that was that big

33:41.200 --> 33:48.320
stupid giant worm that's in the second is in the second or third yeah yeah I hate that thing um

33:49.280 --> 33:55.440
and uh I don't even know what it was but I always would just like it would take me for like even

33:56.240 --> 34:03.440
the newer one the link between worlds that gave me fits too it was a pain in the ass yeah so

34:03.440 --> 34:09.840
I'm just like I'm just cheat to win I don't care I'm playing for the story it doesn't matter I'm

34:09.840 --> 34:15.760
the one playing the game if anyone has a problem with it fuck you all right I'm the one playing

34:15.760 --> 34:20.640
the game and you're not you don't you don't know anyone you play you play the way you want on your

34:20.640 --> 34:25.040
stream and that's they don't like it they go somewhere else it's just been like lately I've

34:25.040 --> 34:30.320
seen a slew of people like complaining about how people are enjoying things I'm like it's not

34:30.320 --> 34:39.520
hurting you yeah fuck off seriously I I I am like right now at the point where I'm just like I don't

give a shit I'm the one playing it you can deal with it there you go all right let's go over to

34:45.680 --> 34:54.320
loki how was your gaming week um so it's minecraft um but it's also I finished playing well as of

34:54.320 --> 34:58.880
right now because they're constantly updating the game but I have completed the entire game

34:59.600 --> 35:08.000
of power wash simulator oh wow things have been power washed now congrats so yeah that that was

35:08.000 --> 35:15.040
fun um but now yeah I wish there's more to do in there um and then minecraft have been extremely

35:15.040 --> 35:22.000
busy the last week or so so I was working on a sorting system and storage system so that was

35:22.000 --> 35:28.240
kind of this entire week and I'm putting together my new episode well I started it this morning so

35:28.240 --> 35:36.320
I should be hopefully out in the next couple days all right um that's it my gaming week as I

35:36.320 --> 35:39.920
mentioned was a little bit slower just with all the other commitments going on I did still play

35:39.920 --> 35:45.840
way too much dead by daylight um I got my adept Claudette achievement today so yay yay I got fanged

35:45.840 --> 35:49.920
to level 10 so I'm gonna get hers next so just kind of working my way through those for no

35:49.920 --> 35:54.800
particular reason it's just a fun I need you to still help me with my Michaela adapt yeah sure

35:54.800 --> 36:00.720
just um but I don't want to lose my 100% survival rate uh well then don't play with me because I

36:00.720 --> 36:06.160
have had some sweaty ass I had a basement bubba today I haven't seen that gag in like six months

36:06.160 --> 36:11.200
and I just forget how exhausting that is to like go down there and rescue someone in the basement

36:11.200 --> 36:18.960
and then and it's like oh fucking really I have to tell you I thought of a way to do um a uh like a

36:20.640 --> 36:27.600
you know basement uh pig but I was gonna call it um like a pantry pig and I decided instead

36:27.600 --> 36:34.960
to call it basement bacon okay so more on that later all right um and then I've still been

36:34.960 --> 36:40.160
playing Final Fantasy 14 been pretty much capping my red tomes every week and working on my gear

36:40.160 --> 36:44.160
for my gunbreaker which is kind of my main class class that I play in that game uh and then

36:44.160 --> 36:49.600
otherwise playing gps games um ingress started their second sunday mission thing officially

36:49.600 --> 36:52.960
they've been kind of doing it unofficially for a few months now and now the official one started

36:52.960 --> 36:57.760
this month today with the new badge so you know the the walking incentive stuff has been really

36:57.760 --> 37:01.760
good um I guess I haven't really mentioned this on olr I've talked about on social media but you

37:01.760 --> 37:06.880
know I've talked about some of my health issues um over the past few months um I'm down over 30

37:06.880 --> 37:10.960
pounds at this point um with all the changes that I've made since that happened and you know

37:10.960 --> 37:16.640
honestly awesome the gp I mean obviously I've been working very hard with you know diet and all that

37:16.640 --> 37:23.840
stuff too but the gps games Pikmin um ingress pokemon go which I actually picked up again which

37:23.840 --> 37:29.920
I hadn't played in a while those have been huge in like gamifying steps so that I actually get more

37:29.920 --> 37:36.080
steps every day so that I really push myself to go out on a walk and things like that is uh very

37:36.080 --> 37:41.280
uh very big thank you I see the kind words in chat yeah it's funny um somebody came up to me

37:41.280 --> 37:47.200
after a rocky last night and was like oh yeah you you look great I saw you in October and yeah I

37:47.200 --> 37:52.160
could tell that you'd put on COVID weight you know I know it was well intentioned because she was

37:52.160 --> 37:57.360
like we all have you know she's got that kind of thing uh and then she was like oh but you you're

37:57.360 --> 38:02.240
looking great and it's it's nice it's a very nice thing um and I didn't I didn't want to tell her

38:02.240 --> 38:09.440
like well I got diagnosed with diabetes and it really whips your ass into gear but we do also

38:09.440 --> 38:18.160
need to stop uh you know what's the word I'm thinking of equivocating um size with with

38:18.160 --> 38:22.000
aesthetics right and the person I was sitting with who kind of listened all that because I

38:22.000 --> 38:26.720
kind of actually leaned in their ear and I said I should have said I should it's a good thing I

38:26.720 --> 38:32.000
didn't say oh I got you know the type 2 diabetes will do that to you um and then my friend actually

38:32.000 --> 38:36.080
said this is why I don't comment on people's bodies because you don't know people's stories

38:36.080 --> 38:41.760
you know and I that's that's kind of my approach too I don't I'm always I'm always afraid I'm

38:41.760 --> 38:46.400
going to say something like oh you've lost weight and then shock they gained it and I'm just an

38:46.400 --> 38:50.560
idiot you know so I just try not to comment on that sort of thing at all unless some somebody

38:50.560 --> 38:55.920
else tells me first oh I've lost weight or oh I'm trying to put on weight for whatever it's like oh

38:55.920 --> 39:00.720
congrats are you meeting your goals okay cool good for you I like to tell tell people that

39:00.720 --> 39:06.640
they're looking healthy yeah exactly you know not necessarily whether or not they've lost weight but

39:06.640 --> 39:11.200
if I see that they've got a glow to their skin and they're energetic like oh you're looking really

39:11.200 --> 39:17.360
healthy today yeah there you go you know because that is completely independent now if they happen

39:17.360 --> 39:22.160
to have lost weight in order to improve their health then that ties in with it happy for them I

39:22.160 --> 39:26.960
mean I'll be honest I was feeling a little bit shallow when I lost all that weight with my

39:26.960 --> 39:38.560
surgery but you know it's size isn't a judge of health totally agree and I you know I it's one

39:38.560 --> 39:43.280
of those things where weight loss is a very nice side effect of all this other bullshit and that's

39:43.280 --> 39:47.760
kind of just how I've explained it is that you know I'll take it this is far said if I'm gonna

39:47.760 --> 39:54.560
work hard sure I'll take weight loss why not it's fun all right anyhow let's move on we're gonna

39:54.560 --> 39:58.800
get into some other news of course I've mentioned this a few times I just want to make sure y'all

39:58.800 --> 40:04.080
know there will be no new OLR next week I know it's kind of a random week to not have a show

40:04.080 --> 40:10.080
but it is because the move so we'll be back in two weeks so that means no podcasts no live show

40:10.800 --> 40:15.120
but Bobby Blackwolf will be here so for the Sunday night loyal crowd over at twitch.tv

40:15.120 --> 40:19.760
slash vog network you will have something to watch next week and for those who on the podcast

40:19.760 --> 40:27.200
feed there is a huge library of back episodes available over at orange launch radio.com or

40:27.200 --> 40:32.480
vog network under orange launch radio if you want to listen to an oldie moldy episode of

40:32.480 --> 40:37.680
OLR to pass the time next week all right let's get into some news and let's talk about a game

40:37.680 --> 40:44.160
that a lot of people have been playing this week and I wish I had had time to download it install

40:44.160 --> 40:49.760
it play it myself but I said I'm gonna wait till after this moving stuff to get sucked into this

40:49.760 --> 40:58.640
so Loki tell us about this yeah so the new uh I guess new for us MMO lost arc has reached a record

40:58.640 --> 41:08.560
number of players on steam with 1.3 million online at peak and that is the third most game or played

41:08.560 --> 41:17.280
game in the history based off active concurrent players um just not bad not bad at all um and

41:17.280 --> 41:24.400
then of course I guess also well I actually now as of when we're looking at this I think it even beat

41:24.400 --> 41:36.160
out um csgo because csgo had their record was uh 1.3 it was like 1 million 308 000 and I think now

41:36.160 --> 41:44.960
they're just past that as well so uh pub g's through the roof right because you know when pub

41:44.960 --> 41:50.240
g yeah like g's like 3.2 million three fortnight there were a ton of people playing uh pub g so

41:50.240 --> 41:57.840
yeah so uh not those numbers anymore but yeah at its heyday it was you know pretty high up there so

41:57.840 --> 42:04.960
um that's pretty great for a brand new mmo for lisa the us and europe I know this came out

42:04.960 --> 42:11.760
originally in south korea in 2019 but um yeah it looks pretty cool well you know it's um I can't

42:11.760 --> 42:18.240
take myself into an mmo at this point it's it's free to play which is you know that's a huge part

42:18.240 --> 42:24.080
of why a lot of people are able to get into it um amazon has been doing a huge push through twitch

42:24.080 --> 42:29.040
you know you probably saw an ad for lost ark before you got here on olr tonight um because

42:29.040 --> 42:33.440
you know well that and that's smart that's amazon leveraging you know the fact that they run twitch

42:33.440 --> 42:37.440
to put in some ads and you know get the hype going for this game which also seemed to work

42:37.440 --> 42:43.200
well for new world uh you know even the new world kind of went like I feel like new world was very

42:43.200 --> 42:48.560
much a flash in the pan so that I know it sounds really harsh but like honestly like it came and

42:48.560 --> 42:53.680
went like sorry to fans of that game you know you don't need my validation to have fun with the game

42:53.680 --> 42:59.040
but it just definitely seems like you know lost or new world was kind of you know the it girl for

42:59.040 --> 43:04.160
like a weekend and then suddenly you know faded out real quick so I'm curious what the staying

43:04.160 --> 43:10.080
power of this is gonna be if this ends up you know going ended up being a tide that comes in

43:10.080 --> 43:13.760
really heavy and then recedes really quick or if this really does end up being something that

43:13.760 --> 43:17.680
stays around and that's part of the reason I've been waiting a little bit to jump on board with

43:17.680 --> 43:23.200
it I mean my personal life doesn't really give me the time right now to download fight queues and do

43:23.200 --> 43:29.040
all that with something new um but you know if it's still relevant in a couple weeks and my

43:29.040 --> 43:35.520
friends are still playing it uh I would definitely want to check it out um looking at some comments

43:35.520 --> 43:40.560
from chat quest buster says launch was also delayed by several hours because of the demand

43:40.560 --> 43:45.600
on the 11th but founders were able to get in a few days before that quest buster continuing uh who

43:45.600 --> 43:49.920
also had commented that they've been playing a lot of it this week um it's a ton of fun but the first

43:49.920 --> 43:54.720
few hours are a bit slow they tightened some of the experience up from what I had played from

43:54.720 --> 44:00.560
the Russian version so it is also interesting that a game that's technically already existed

44:00.560 --> 44:06.400
for quite some time yes in other parts of the world and other localizations it's interesting

44:06.400 --> 44:12.880
that it's so popular and now I'm curious to see because of this what else is going to suddenly

44:12.880 --> 44:20.720
show up that's been out for a long time in other places we'll see any interest in lost ark uh

44:21.840 --> 44:25.520
I think dark soccer already said pass but loki did you you have any interest in lost

44:25.520 --> 44:32.640
art no I I can't jump into it well I can't oh oh there's no uh mac even though yeah it's not

44:32.640 --> 44:39.360
I don't think it runs on windows arm either oh bummer all right all right well moving on let's

44:39.360 --> 44:46.160
talk about call of duty because of course with the pending purchase of microsoft to

44:46.720 --> 44:51.920
buy activision blizzard a lot of people have been presuming that call of duty is going to end up an

44:51.920 --> 44:55.840
exclusive and it certainly would make a lot of sense that it would go that direction however

44:56.800 --> 45:02.160
this is very interesting the president of microsoft brad smith made a blog post saying

45:02.160 --> 45:07.120
microsoft will continue to make call of duty and other popular activision blizzard titles available

45:07.120 --> 45:13.040
on playstation through the term of any existing agreement with activision and we have committed

45:13.040 --> 45:18.480
to sony that we will also make them available on playstation beyond the existing agreement

45:18.480 --> 45:23.840
and into the future so that sony fans can continue continue to enjoy the games they love

45:23.840 --> 45:28.880
we are also interested in taking similar steps to support nintendo's successful platform

45:28.880 --> 45:33.520
we believe this is the right thing for the industry uh for gamers and for our business

45:34.480 --> 45:39.040
uh many folks that are a little more skeptical about these sorts of things and i don't blame them

45:39.040 --> 45:44.720
thinking that this might be microsoft's way to sort of respond to the fact that the ftc is all

45:44.720 --> 45:51.200
up in this business uh for the approval of the takeover and so forth so perhaps um sony or

45:51.200 --> 45:58.400
excuse me microsoft committing to supporting sony platforms is um gonna help them get through this

45:58.400 --> 46:05.280
i guess or what have you um now maybe i'm just being a jerk but i don't think i am i would still

46:05.280 --> 46:10.240
be highly skeptical of all this not i call of duty will come out for playstation you know if

46:10.240 --> 46:16.480
they said it they're gonna do it but it doesn't mean it's gonna be the version you want because

46:16.480 --> 46:24.160
i think we're definitely gonna see the extra maps extra characters extra stuff is going to be the

46:24.160 --> 46:30.160
definitive version will be the microsoft version the sony version will be an afterthought uh

46:31.120 --> 46:35.440
as will honestly probably nintendo's um just because of the limitations of the platform

46:35.440 --> 46:38.800
now of course in a couple years when we're talking about nintendo's successor platform

46:39.520 --> 46:46.960
that's a different conversation but um i i i still think microsoft would be foolish to not

46:46.960 --> 46:54.560
have call of duty be the must play experience on their own platform and will sony do the same

46:54.560 --> 47:00.080
thing with destiny and whatever bungee has cooking for the future abso-fucking-lutely

47:00.080 --> 47:05.040
abso-fucking-lutely and of course microsoft also gets call of duty on game pass which is going to

47:05.040 --> 47:11.040
be huge and they can continue to charge 60 bucks on playstation at launch i think a lot of it is

47:11.040 --> 47:19.120
just that illusion of supporting everything equally um and i'm not so sure it really is

47:20.000 --> 47:23.120
but i guess that's nice for people that never ever want to get a

47:24.640 --> 47:31.600
xbox or play on their pc i suppose so all right let's move on dark sakura

47:35.840 --> 47:40.960
i had to unmute my my mic every time i click it it actually immediately remutes itself is so weird

47:41.440 --> 47:49.200
any rate um i remember going to e3 and always finding like the america's army area and they

47:49.200 --> 47:55.360
were like always like oh play play this you'll see you know and then and then sign up for for

47:55.360 --> 48:03.440
the rest of your life um well they and honestly it was a really revolutionary idea to use a video

48:03.440 --> 48:12.080
game as a recruitment tool 20 years ago um now though they have uh uh you know it's free to play

48:12.080 --> 48:17.600
it was really successful a lot of people said it was really fun but as of may 5th this year they

48:17.600 --> 48:27.440
are going to shut down the servers and uh it's going to be retired so uh it i mean the the thing

48:27.440 --> 48:33.040
with this particular with this particular game and and something like it is that it really was

48:33.040 --> 48:38.960
a novel concept when it came out you know yeah we all knew oh this is a recruitment tool but

48:38.960 --> 48:46.000
it also was supposedly a really good game i mean right and i mean we had so many different you

48:46.000 --> 48:51.200
know military related games come out over the years but you know america's army was only supposed

48:51.200 --> 49:00.640
to last for seven years but it was so successful that they uh actually the pentagon approved

49:00.640 --> 49:07.440
spending more than three million a year to uh to promote the game and expand upon it

49:07.440 --> 49:13.040
um i mean and right now the uh their recruiting budget i think is like eight billion

49:14.400 --> 49:19.520
so that's not i mean that's only a small percentage of their recruiting budget but still

49:19.520 --> 49:25.440
it is a big chunk of change um and then they said you know there was a study in 2008 from

49:25.440 --> 49:31.680
uh the massachusetts institute of technology so mit um that said that thirty percent of all

49:31.680 --> 49:37.760
americans ages 16 to 24 had a more positive impression of the army because of the game

49:37.760 --> 49:44.720
and the game had a large impact on recruiting so it was clearly successful i mean the army has a

49:44.720 --> 49:50.160
twitch channel well yes i know about that but that that hasn't always been good news because

49:50.160 --> 49:54.800
that was the one where people were going in there and asking about war crimes and so they would get

49:54.800 --> 49:58.480
banned but then it was like well the government can't ban people it's freedom of speech right so

49:58.480 --> 50:03.360
it started that whole interesting conversation and how there are protocols on that but um going

50:03.360 --> 50:08.320
back to the game itself yeah i mean i've i've heard i've i've no interest in the game i'm not

50:08.320 --> 50:12.400
going to play it or or really cover it on this show beyond these um interesting pop culture

50:12.880 --> 50:20.640
uh and gaming culture notes but um everything i've heard is that for what it is you would expect

50:20.640 --> 50:25.440
that it's a shitty game usually these types of games are pretty shitty like you know when

50:25.440 --> 50:30.720
corporate corporations and the army in a sense is a corporation trying to catch the corporation

50:30.720 --> 50:37.040
yeah trying to cash in on what the cool kids enjoy right is usually kind of doesn't work out very

50:37.040 --> 50:43.200
well but apparently this was a pretty decent game from what i heard so um that's part of why it was

50:43.200 --> 50:47.840
successful is that you know and and i realize people have their criticisms and and it's fine

50:48.480 --> 50:54.800
but it seems like the people that were making this game were actually listening to what gamers kind

50:54.800 --> 51:00.560
of wanted to play and actually developing a game that would be fun and not what like research

51:00.560 --> 51:04.960
groups said would be fun a boring recruitment tool isn't gonna it won't recruit anybody

51:05.600 --> 51:12.720
right so well the other thing too is like the federal aviation administration um had a hiring

51:12.720 --> 51:19.280
campaign they were looking for 4300 air traffic controllers in about five years and they focused

51:19.280 --> 51:28.160
on gamers and they met they i think supposedly are already well on their way to um to hitting

51:28.160 --> 51:34.080
their goal but a lot of you know these different institutions now are eyeing

51:35.760 --> 51:44.240
games and gamers for their their hiring base you know because certain skills hand-eye coordination

51:44.240 --> 51:50.080
you know of course would carry over and then they also you know can judge mindsets by what type of

51:50.080 --> 51:54.480
games people are playing you know so there's a lot of you know very interesting psychology that goes

51:54.480 --> 52:01.120
into it but you know and of course there's also then putting out you know i call it the the last

52:01.120 --> 52:07.680
star fighter syndrome who all remembers that movie it's been a long time where you know they put out

52:07.680 --> 52:13.840
the arcade machine and it was a test to see who was going to be the next star fighter um and then

52:13.840 --> 52:19.120
then the guy gets kidnapped and goes to outer space and you know and then his robot twin makes

52:19.120 --> 52:29.920
out with his girlfriend but anyway um they're using different games also as sort of uh disguised

52:29.920 --> 52:37.040
tests for certain skill sets and so you know i i just still think it's very interesting that

52:37.040 --> 52:42.800
we have so many government facilities that are like oh games are bad and the army's like fuck

52:42.800 --> 52:48.400
yeah games yeah we're gonna use these games we're gonna get some more some more grunts i had no idea

52:48.400 --> 52:52.320
about the air traffic controller thing and then i think about like something like flight simulator

52:52.320 --> 52:58.560
where it's like okay maybe flight simulator is not anything like actually flying a real plane

52:58.560 --> 53:04.880
but it really is educational as to what all goes into it like if you actually play flight simulator

53:04.880 --> 53:10.320
on you know simulator mode you're really thinking about especially this new one that Microsoft put

53:10.320 --> 53:15.360
out not that long ago um really gets into the weeds on like here's everything that goes into

53:15.440 --> 53:20.480
takeoff and you're taking classes at your computer basically um and again i'm not trying to say that

53:20.480 --> 53:26.640
like oh i played flight simulator i can fly a real plane suddenly no but you'll have an absolute leg

53:26.640 --> 53:33.040
up on somebody who's never uh touched that you know if you were to uh want to take actual you

53:33.040 --> 53:41.200
know plane flying classes so uh very interesting uh with gaming as a recruitment so i'm going to

53:41.200 --> 53:47.280
our chat for some additional comments sg100 matt says geez 22 years old since this was in beta i

53:47.280 --> 53:51.840
remember seeing america's army at digital life i wouldn't have guessed it was still going on yeah

53:51.840 --> 53:58.880
i thought it had faded out a few years ago but i i felt it still had an impressive run um so you know

53:58.880 --> 54:06.480
i mean i again games like this usually come out are laughed at and fade away within a year so the

54:06.560 --> 54:11.920
fact that this one lasted over 20 years pretty fascinating to be honest yeah yeah and with

54:11.920 --> 54:19.600
constant development so pretty cool yeah pretty cool all right let's move on loki all right so

54:19.600 --> 54:24.800
of course with all the acquisitions that microsoft is making everyone is kind of asking so you know

54:24.800 --> 54:30.640
all these games go in the games pass isn't that gonna raise the price of games pass you know it's

54:30.640 --> 54:34.320
gotta happen at some point because where's all this money gonna come from that they're buying

54:34.320 --> 54:40.240
all these companies with well apparently phil spencer was trying to kind of uh point out that

54:40.240 --> 54:46.080
no no no no they don't have plans right now to raise the price of game pass um so kind of

54:46.080 --> 54:50.400
addressing the rumors that it was going to go up in price i feel like i can't prove this negative

54:51.040 --> 54:56.560
um people ask one is the game pass price going to go up they're buying all these studios you know

54:56.560 --> 55:02.400
it's inevitable even though it's been for what now four years we haven't raised it but it's like you

55:02.400 --> 55:07.280
know it's coming when are they when they are number one they're gonna start doing all these

55:07.280 --> 55:13.040
exclusive deals like that you know xbox has history and all i can do is make decisions that

55:13.040 --> 55:16.880
are in front of us and try to be explicit about what our goals are so it sounds like that they're

55:16.880 --> 55:21.840
trying to at least be pretty transparent with it um that they don't have plans to raise the price

55:21.840 --> 55:27.520
of games pass and i'm sure when they do that they will let everybody know yeah they'll raise it

55:27.520 --> 55:32.880
eventually don't kid yourself or i mean they'll they'll absolutely raise it eventually i what i

55:32.880 --> 55:38.240
hope does doesn't happen is i don't want to see them go into tears that would be really crappy

55:38.240 --> 55:42.240
um so i really hope microsoft doesn't go that direction but um because then then you end up in

55:42.240 --> 55:48.080
the nintendo problem the lowest tier gets hardly any love i mean i guess hooray we got earthbound

55:48.080 --> 55:53.760
um but you know what what other bones are they going to throw at it over the next year um so

55:53.760 --> 55:57.760
yeah i don't want to see microsoft tear it i think we should all prepare for the price to

55:57.760 --> 56:05.760
go up and let's also be real if you are a smart shopper trademark patent pending um you'll never

56:05.760 --> 56:10.560
pay full price for game pass and i've talked about it here on the show is that obviously you know i'm

56:10.560 --> 56:16.000
sure you all follow those gaming deals whether it be you know the cheap ass gamer wario 64 all those

56:16.000 --> 56:20.720
types of put that when those cards go on sale and they will go on sale and i'm sure there are plenty

56:20.720 --> 56:28.960
of you show of hands how many of you on black friday or around that time will stock the fuck up

56:28.960 --> 56:35.520
on uh your cards for you know playstation microsoft and so forth for the next year

56:35.520 --> 56:41.920
i'm sure there's people that do that for sure um uh and uh i've also talked about that i use the

56:41.920 --> 56:47.280
microsoft rewards app uh now and i i understand why people might be adverse to using that because

56:47.280 --> 56:51.520
essentially you're allowing you know extra data to go to microsoft and all this stuff and you

56:51.520 --> 56:58.480
actually have to use bing which some people might fear um but i use it casually and i would say

56:59.520 --> 57:04.720
one out of every three months i get comped through microsoft rewards you end up getting 12 000 points

57:04.720 --> 57:09.360
and get a free month and so you know i i hope they would keep things like that into place if

57:09.360 --> 57:15.440
nothing else you could probably get a discount so you know again if you're if you're a choosy choosy

57:15.440 --> 57:22.400
shopper you'll never pay full price for these things so uh pod culture and chat says i loaded

57:22.400 --> 57:29.120
up on black friday yep uh mike def says maybe uh sj100 matt saying i'm glad i have game pass

57:29.120 --> 57:35.040
locked in for the next two years that xbox live gold trick oh that's probably also keeping them

57:35.040 --> 57:39.920
from raising the price these people that are still locked in that won't have to pay it i wonder if

57:39.920 --> 57:44.800
they're gonna wait another two years for everybody to be out of that that would be very interesting

57:44.800 --> 57:49.440
uh fifth dream points out i think i have playstation network for three more years

57:49.440 --> 57:54.480
so again kind of loading up uh maybe when it was cheap and you know what how how far out can you

57:54.480 --> 58:01.680
load up xbox live like three years or something like that i mean if we think it's coming maybe

58:01.680 --> 58:06.400
load up your account the next time these things go on sale something something to think about

58:07.200 --> 58:13.440
but i also know that's a big you know that's a big uh cost and not maybe everybody's super into

58:13.440 --> 58:17.600
game pass i don't know but uh i think it's great i love that they're building the cloud stuff into

58:17.600 --> 58:24.320
it too so uh i plan to stick with it for a little while so all right uh did your mom says you can

58:24.320 --> 58:30.640
load up to five years if i recall correctly uh as shown her matt says three years uh i wonder if you

58:30.640 --> 58:36.080
know we might be talking about conversion uh that whole thing versus how much you can actually load

58:36.080 --> 58:39.920
up i don't know i'd have i have to look into it i'm not sure the answer but it would be at least

58:39.920 --> 58:44.880
i'm sure it's at least two three years that you can load in advance um something to think about

58:44.880 --> 58:51.280
if you're that worried about the price going up um anyhow let's talk about a new playstation 5

58:51.280 --> 58:55.200
update that's coming out uh since we've been talking a lot about microsoft let's show a little

58:55.200 --> 59:01.440
love to sony after all isn't uh i think horizon forbidden west is this week isn't it that's uh

59:01.440 --> 59:05.040
that's a big deal for sony so i'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be on that this

59:05.040 --> 59:11.920
week um so uh anyway there will be a new system update for place actually sorry i i my mind

59:11.920 --> 59:17.760
derailed again but i wanted to say i heard the speaking of horizon forbidden west i heard it is

59:17.760 --> 59:25.360
two discs on playstation 4 you don't hear that one very often what year is this well it's because

59:25.360 --> 59:35.760
it's a 90 gig install so uh laughs in call of duty updates yeah well yeah it's a lot but i'm

59:36.640 --> 59:41.120
i mean there's two ways to look at it there's one going uh it's gonna eat so much of my space but

59:41.120 --> 59:46.720
then you also go that means it's a fucking big game well also like if it's a 90 gig install at

59:46.720 --> 59:52.240
least they have it on disk and they're not like saying hey you can download that first or you can

59:52.240 --> 59:56.480
you know download that first 10 from the disc but you gotta download the rest from the cloud

59:56.480 --> 01:00:03.040
good luck yeah i am so excited y'all my new internet that i'm gonna have as of saturday

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:10.000
no limit no limit yay i i can reconnect my xbox to automatic updates again i'm so excited

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.480
download all of the updates update all you want i cannot wait to download the shit out of everything

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.520
i can finally run my steam updates that i've been backlogged for like years it's fucking exciting

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:27.520
y'all all right anyway yeah or as to 100 matt making the classic bemoni reference going no

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:36.480
no limit no no no limit all right um anyway uh as 200 matt also used google fu to find out 36

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.040
months is the max you can load up uh xbox live but interesting mike def says it depends on the

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:46.720
region because mexico is only two and a half years oh that is interesting it could be by region too

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.360
all right sorry we derailed i wanted to talk about this new update for playstation 4 and playstation

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.160
that is going to be adding new accessibility and quality of life features including voice commands

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.800
uh right now a beta is going to be made available to english-speaking users in the u.s and uk

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.000
that will let you say hey playstation and sorry if i woke yours up but i don't think this beta

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.640
is actually out yet but it will be soon you can turn this feature off just like all the other

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.920
home assistants if you want and then you can use your voice to launch games whatever apps

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:24.400
open the system menu control media playback and so on and so on i have to say i i never saw myself

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.920
really using a lot of the voice commands but i have found it awfully convenient for the bedroom

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:38.720
tv which has a google chrome cast on it to say hey you know the word smart assistant um uh turn

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:44.720
on my television and launch twitch and it's nice to just have it all come up there while i'm you

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:49.280
know you know brushing my teeth and other stuff and then i can crawl into bed and watch twitch

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:54.720
before uh i drift off so it's just kind of kind of neat uh so they're building the same thing into

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.720
playstation why not there's a lot of media and stuff on playstation and if you want to launch

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:05.360
games that way sure why not also group chats will now be known as parties and you can decide if you

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:11.120
want them to be private or public parties so there's that uh if you leave a party public and

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:16.080
open your friends can join their friends can join so it definitely will be a party

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:21.600
also you'll now be able to filter games by genre and have five of them on the console's home screen

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:27.200
for quick access apparently trophy cards are going to be redesigned on ps5 and there will be more

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.080
screen reader languages which is great for accessibility and some other changes as well

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:38.240
you can opt into the beta test if you want over at playstation.com but get on that uh

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.720
wednesday is when they're gonna uh send out the emails on if you got in or not but that's pretty

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:49.200
exciting so uh let's see fifth dream in chat says that was always a good idea but usually muscle

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:55.440
memory and clicking buttons to launch games and whatever it's just quicker yes and no i do agree

01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:00.880
with you but sometimes they change the interface uh and playstation is done at least on playstation

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.040
four because like you have to launch everything through the tv and video app when it comes to

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:10.720
stuff like twitch and stuff like things move around so it is and then like it it starts it's

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.560
not as fast as it used to be so like i have to launch it and wait for the icons to show up so

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.040
i can see where twitch is today or if it got rearranged or whatever at least that's been my

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:29.120
experience i just it's just easier to tell my uh you know a home assistant by uh g o o g l e to

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.520
sorry i'm really trying to not launch all of your assistants i have to remember that in this day

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:40.240
and age you you could call it uh call it gurgle yeah sure sure so i can say gurgle uh do this

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.280
thing and uh yeah it's just easier i think you just you you adapt the muscle memory i guess

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:54.640
all right uh up next oh it's this headline again we always like to hear this person in the news

01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:04.480
because it makes for a funny headline right dark sagra yeah so um bowser has a 40 month stint to

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:10.000
do in prison yeah but not the bowser you're thinking uh unless you are thinking of the

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.040
hacker gary bowser so um he was the the person that had the switch hacking group team uh

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:26.000
executor um and so uh of course he's not doug bowser just saying even though they got their

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.920
names mixed up in the original version of the article oops um but he was part of a collective

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:38.640
that uh sold devices that you could use to pay to play pirated games on your switch um

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:45.520
they the fbi arrested him in 2020 and he agreed to pay 10 million to nintendo

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.640
for a civil privacy lawsuit and then another 4.5 million for restitution

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:58.000
but the sentencing today um not today but when they were doing the sentencing uh he was facing

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.320
up to 10 years in prison um and also because video game publishers apparently have lost more

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:12.880
than 65 million thanks to what team uh executor did they were wanting to to go for that instead

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:19.520
he is getting he got 40 months so that's still you know a big chunk out of his life and they're

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:27.680
still looking to find um his accomplices so that's really about all we know now but but yeah he's

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:34.800
being sentenced assisted well in 40 months maybe is when they'll release super mario odyssey 2

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:40.400
because bowser will get out of prison and kidnap the princess yet again uh dart tetsuya in chat

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.960
says i know everyone is taking up pitchforks against nintendo but i heard this guy had

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:49.840
malicious code in his mods i don't know if i can feel too sorry if that's the case um i don't know

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:53.360
if i'd believe everything i read on the internet but at the same time i also don't understand the

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:58.560
pitchforks against nintendo for this i mean this guy was pretty cocky from what i understand like

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:03.360
nintendo had slapped this guy down a couple times before and he was kind of continuing his stuff

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:09.200
thinking he was invincible so it kind of sounds like he got what was coming to him like exactly

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:15.760
and and the thing is it's one thing that if they're you know giving something away for for

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:23.120
free you know right but the fact that he was making money off of someone else's work pretty

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:30.880
much you know or as a uh an exploit to get around somebody else's work i mean it's i and now you

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:37.440
know i'll be honest i had like you know an r4 back in the day and and all of those but at the

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:44.560
end you know those for active systems those are things that are that are taking you know money

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.160
from the developers from from the people who are making the games and at this like if it was you

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.840
know say oh we've put out this you know the everdrive you know for a snus that's one thing

01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:03.280
it's an old system they're not really making any money on you know obscure you know import games

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.920
unless they're going to put them out you know on the e-shop or something right so that's one thing

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:15.520
but for a modern active consistently updated and having released games for system that's many

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:22.720
hyphens in that phrase by the way um it makes perfect sense um and then to go around and be

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:28.080
oh i can't do shit to me and me and i'm like no do shit to him please yeah do lots of shit to him

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:33.840
and don't get me wrong i'm all for you know homebrew on consoles and you know unlocks to

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:38.320
do that and i realize it can be a slippery slope with piracy and i don't think we should be

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.960
pirating games i think we should you know support where we can the developers of worth but i'm all

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:48.400
for homebrew and things that open that up but when you're being very flagrant that you're doing it

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:54.400
for piracy which i kind of get the sense this guy was then it's kind of one of those why are we all

01:07:54.400 --> 01:08:01.040
acting shocked that nintendo did this i i don't think you know we we nintendo is known for very

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:05.920
being very um aggressive to protect its shit but usually they're not going to try to send you to

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.880
jail they might shut you down like that youtuber um a few weeks ago but they're not gonna they're

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:16.320
not gonna go after that person to jail because they weren't like trying to flagrantly make money

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:22.000
off nintendo and pirate games and things of that sort and i think that's where uh this you know bad

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:28.320
bowser went wrong to be honest only sonic and chat says yeah modded my we too just a few years ago

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:33.440
yeah i modded mine and i'll also say it's the one time i did advocate for piracy because i did it to

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:41.600
play a game that nintendo refused to release here um and the sing star abba it uh i did end up doing

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:47.600
that but it was the xena i remember that's when tiara was visiting we came over it was xena blade

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.240
did it and then they ended up doing the game stop exclusive agreement which i still thought was shit

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.760
so i think in those circumstances i think it's a little more justified um but i mean like again if

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:03.440
i can walk into a target or other similar store you know and pick up the item off the shelf i

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.280
you know i'm probably gonna i'm 99.9 times out of 100 that's what i'll do but in those extreme cases

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:13.280
where you know what there's a game i want to play and the company refuses to release it in the us

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.040
i don't feel bad about piracy whatsoever in fact i would encourage people to pirate mother 3

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:29.440
oh um i i have a cartridge yeah i have a translated cartridge so but i will say to

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:36.720
companies credit even past where we were at with the nintendo we so many years ago i feel like

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.480
companies are finally realizing we live in a global sort of environment and we see more stuff

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:47.520
get released here um i think taiko no tatsujin is a great example we're seeing a lot of those

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:53.840
games ending up releasing here when you know uh we all remember a time when those were very uh

01:09:53.840 --> 01:10:00.000
nuanced you know japanese releases only that never saw the light of day over here and now we're

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.520
seeing them because i think these companies realize oh yes we live in a global economy

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:10.960
economy so uh mike deaf says sing star abba was ps3 there was a comparable one on the wii um there

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.480
was it was a it was just dance maybe or what yeah it was just dance there was a comparable abba game

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.600
on wii so yeah i think it was no it wasn't just dance it was like let's dance abba or something

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:29.840
like oh yeah it's even worse knock off something oh like we sing abba yeah yeah we sing abba uh

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.240
orange right says i would have never guessed taiko would be a worldwide release game that

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.440
would get announced on nintendo directs back in the 2000s exactly so things are getting better

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.800
in that regard so that's why you don't hear me like you know this show has been on for 20 years

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.760
so you could probably go back and find rob roberts advocating piracy in certain scenarios

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:56.960
but these days the the reasons to do it are not you know the games are available for you to pay

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.440
for them and pay the developers for their work and i think that's what you should do in the case of

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:08.320
mother 3 that is not an option for us so steal away in this case it's a political protest you

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.560
know yeah in a way yeah you are protesting the fact that this game has a high demand in the us

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.560
and they aren't releasing it so we're taking matters into our own hands at the end of story

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.560
i will be happy to pay for it once it's made available to me indeed same absolute same all

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:29.920
right uh yeah as 200 matt says i mean we all modded our playstation ones to play ddr titles

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:36.480
well i would argue that konami konami is or you use the plug right but i would argue that konami

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:40.880
is one of the worst offenders and this is why i think that it's actually you bring that up

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:47.280
i think that's very relevant to the history of our show let's really send off studio n7 tonight

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:53.120
and take a look back at the 20-year history of the show in the early years of the show the only

01:11:53.120 --> 01:12:01.840
way we could play ddr was to either pay excruciatingly high import fees for games or to mod

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:08.960
or to steal them essentially and i'm i'm sorry not sorry we stole them because that was the

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:14.320
only reasonable way to play them but you know what every time they released a mix here even if

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:21.680
it was subpar when ddr the original one came out on playstation the us version bought it konamiks

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.400
which i think turned like 22 years old this week i saw a tweet or something like that konamiks when

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.600
that came out bought it and all the other stuff bought those as well so um you know i would

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:37.040
support it when it finally would show up here uh and as joe and her map points out i remember it

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:43.680
was a big deal when the ds was region free yeah orange right says i even bought beatmania us

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:50.400
hey that control same but the controller was better remember uh yeah i well how many times

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:57.360
did we shave our 2dx japanese controller buttons and they think that you know mine actually had

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:04.400
the little pad mods underneath them um but then they constructed the new ones i think with

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.280
there's something very similar to those mods i heard there were some japanese players that

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:15.280
imported our version for that reason to get that controller yeah yep i i have a couple of friends

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:20.880
actually who were like hey can you send me a controller and i'd be like uh i'll see where i

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.800
can find them if i find oh well we just had someone so important for us sorry about it like

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:31.120
okay well i didn't buy it so fine i just i still have mine uh they just turned up in the garage

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:38.640
uh our old controllers for that so i have honey i actually need to find my copy of para para because

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:44.080
i have my biscuits and i don't have a game oh so and i wanted to bust it out and play it the other

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:52.320
day i actually was planning on hooking up uh uh 2dx uh fourth style so i could get no what no

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:58.000
was third style that had the right version of the safari oh yeah the slower one yeah the right

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.920
version of the safari not the crappy speedy one all right anyway let's move on too far down memory

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:10.880
lane but good times uh let's move on loki yeah so you know we've talked about how battlefield 2042

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:17.600
is kind of bad and because of that there is a change.org petition asking electronic arts to

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:24.880
offer refunds on all platforms for their players and they already have more than 150,000 people

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:32.880
that has signed that petition because it is pretty bad and they're losing players every day so

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.920
we'll see if that ends up happening the thing to note though is even though they have 150,000

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.400
signatures other campaigns have gotten a lot more signatures like for example making shaggy dlc in

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:58.720
moral combat 11 381 000 signatures so we'll see uh what pardon my ignorance on this but we all

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:05.440
know i don't usually play these type of games so what's wrong with the game loki can you translate

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:12.080
to gay for me yes i will translate so it is a very rushed and buggy put together game

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:17.360
for example some of the complaints that they have in there there's balancing issues with the

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.680
vehicles in the game hovercrafts are like way too op you can drive up the side of buildings with

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:28.160
those you can constantly respawn them um they may go from mass effect the very basics like a gun

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:33.680
play are just broken like you can literally empty a full clip into somebody and it doesn't register

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:41.200
a hit against them like just ridiculously stupid things like that so it's just it's very much broken

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:49.120
all right thank you for translating it sounds sounds like a hot mess it is a hot mess all right

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:58.640
um also a hot mess uh countries that don't support uh equal rights uh for all lgbtq people and we're

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.800
seeing that play out with a sims 4 wedding expansion and uh this expansion is not going

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:10.640
to release in russia because of federal laws over there that will not allow it to release

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:17.600
uh there was a law passed in 2013 uh that uh some folks uh outside of uh russia sometimes

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:24.480
call it the russia gay propaganda law um so basically uh maxis in a blog post called our

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.520
commitment to you a letter to our players from the sims team mentions that because there is a

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:35.280
wedding themed storyline involving a same-sex marriage between two characters uh it's a quote

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.720
not something we could freely share around the world and so the team wanted to quote explain the

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:46.000
decision that we've made not to release this pack in russia and it basically came down to the fact

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.960
that the team could either tell this story or uh they could uh and avoid the russia market or they

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:59.280
could change the content to meet those sorts of federal laws and they've decided to say uh we'll

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:04.480
just choose not to release it there at all um so this would be and i know we have listeners over

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:09.120
there so this would be a great this is one of those great opportunities where uh you could just

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:15.200
pirate it and play it anyway uh because not but i mean in this case it sucks because we should

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.800
support the developers but also it's funny because dark sakura talked about sometimes piracy being a

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:28.080
political protest and i feel in this particular case it really is right so very interesting so

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:34.080
but hey props to maxis first because you know other companies would have just said okay we'll

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:40.480
change the gender of the character um which they could have easily done um but they didn't do it

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:45.920
so that's great uh dart to see it says uh i remember that being a whole thing back around

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:52.240
the time of the winter olympics back then yeah so all right let's let's go back to

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.080
a simpler time shall we and uh revisit uh this segment that we love to do on our show

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:14.560
and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:19.520
out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:26.480
and what did you pick for us this week dark sakura jockey crush as they say in the intro

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:34.960
of it jockey crush it is well you remember xtifer playing all the alien crush he could possibly play

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:39.040
yeah he he really loved your guys's old place yeah that was on we virtual console yeah

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:49.360
um well jockey crush is the third in that whole series so of course the uh the first one being

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:55.120
alien crush and then devil's crush well actually dragon's revenge is also i guess would sort of be

01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:02.080
the third one that came out that was the the uh genesis one that wasn't as great as the others

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:10.000
but jockey crush is continuing with that sort of uh otherworldly theme in the fact that it's an

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:18.240
ogre themed uh jockey is a type of a japanese demon um but it's another pinball game virtual

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.160
pinball game this one came out on the super famicon it never came out in the us um and it's

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:29.200
an it's an excellent game if you like you know virtual pinball uh one of the the great things

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:34.320
about this one is that it has a lot more in common with devil's crush uh in the fact that

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:42.640
it has these uh six hidden stages um and you also have alternating two player play um different

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:47.600
options where you can have different control control configurations your ball physics things

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:54.080
like that you know different speed settings um you also have um you know different tiers like

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:59.840
i was saying in the in uh in your levels the third level has like moving targets and uh

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:03.440
different lanes that lead you back to the second level you know all kinds of ways that you can get

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:12.000
around through there um it's it's really a very beautiful game as well um it is a little on the

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:20.240
dark side but dark and vivid if if that makes sense um and in in fact it's actually even

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:27.040
considered you know an equal to any of the others in the series you know even slightly crisper in

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:38.400
terms of its uh its uh design and color scheme but uh jackie crush uh came out in 1992 uh again for

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:47.600
the super famicom put up by an access soft um and it's again in the whole crush series um it also

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.600
you know i'd have to say that

01:20:51.840 --> 01:21:00.880
if you've got a way to play this game and you have not i would actually do it yeah this is

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.520
actually the official third game because that uh that genesis one that came out i don't really

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.040
think it was actually part of the part of the series like an official part of the series more

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:18.240
like a spiritual successor type game but um i i also you know it's got a like story to it

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:26.240
and everything about like you know the magical pinball from hell or something um and the the

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.160
sad thing about it is that while there are a lot of enthusiasts who do recall alien crush and

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.480
devil's crush um they don't know about jackie crush because it didn't come out over here i

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.000
know i've mentioned it on the show before fifth stream was talking about demon's tilt and demon's

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.520
tilt is an absolute spiritual successor to the series i i've actually streamed a decent bit of

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:54.480
this game as well um i jackie crush in fact i i might actually just bust this out later this week

01:21:54.480 --> 01:22:01.120
and show it off um maybe on my wednesday night stream but it's really worth playing um of course

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:06.080
also developed by compile and compile has given us one of the other best games in the universe

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:11.520
the guardian legend so and on top of that too the music is really good

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:20.880
yeah i noticed the music in this is great oh yeah the music in this game it just really sets

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:27.600
the entire tone for it and on top of that you know there's uh gosh it's like this one

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:34.240
uh stage on the table where it's sort of like this sort of purple rocky

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:41.600
side and it's got this uh the jackie in the center of it you know in red and white and it almost

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:47.040
makes me think that it's like in this sort of abyss where everything else just has that sort

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:53.680
of red outlined and and it honestly feels like there's some true depth in the game even though

01:22:53.680 --> 01:23:02.320
it's two-dimensional so i i have absolutely been enamored with this game um i wouldn't mind owning

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:08.560
an original of it and i've played it you know uh quite a few times i really enjoy it but i

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:14.960
just think that there's like a sort of crispness to this one that is missing from quite a few other

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:22.080
uh uh pinball tables and in fact uh the one on stream right now is always the mode that i called

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:28.880
uh space invader mode sort of um but i think that there are so many different variances in

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:37.200
in gameplay between the multiple stages that you have enough to keep you interested in it it's got

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:44.320
a good enough challenge to it that the replayability is absolutely there um okay

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.400
sorry to the podcast listeners but this mode that we're looking at on twitch right now this creepy

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:56.800
as fuck yeah it has sort of like this uh almost like kind of reminds me of miss nude world

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:07.120
the face in the background is sort of like almost like a type of no mask i think um but uh you also

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.280
have like these little spheres that are coming coming out almost like little uh scarabs what it

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:17.440
looks like and then uh you you're sort of arcanoid style except you've got your your paddles and so

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:23.440
you're shooting the little uh demon ball around and trying to destroy them all and then you have

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:29.840
to the eyes on the background start blinking in red and you have to shoot the ball into one of

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:37.680
those eyeballs and as you go through it the face changes more and more to the style of a hanya mask

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:44.560
if you don't know what that is go look it up um where it gets more and more demonic as you know

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:48.160
well i'd say more like you know traditional ogre style masks like

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:56.320
like i said like a hanya and it's really well detailed and absolutely gorgeous the the shading

01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:05.920
i mean it's for pixel art it's good artwork wouldn't you say yeah see and and and like in

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:10.080
the level it's on now like the face is getting more orange and it definitely looks a lot more

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:16.800
like the traditional hanya so i i absolutely love this game especially you know bringing in the

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:24.720
mythos of this particular one i i absolutely love it um so i will talk about um the others in the

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.280
series just a little bit because i think i have talked about alien crush before and devil's crush

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:35.120
i think i've done them both as a classic game um the other game that i mentioned is dragon's revenge

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:42.800
which is sort of like a genesis answer um it's not really as good the ball physics are

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:50.080
not great i mean it's it's it's an amusing play i'll put it that way but it isn't great but there

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:59.520
was a uh a we wear release uh updated version of alien crush called alien crush returns

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.960
and it was pretty neat i mean i'll probably talk about that as a classic game later

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:11.520
but you know this is just one in the series i mean every game that's in the official crush

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:16.080
series is absolutely worth playing and then if you want the modern take on it like we're saying

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:28.000
earlier um there is a uh a demon's tilt on steam it is also available uh on mac on steam absolutely

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:37.120
absolutely a good way to satisfy that uh that'll crush pinball uh craving if you get it

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.520
so that's what i'm gonna throw in there jackie crush if you get a chance to play it absolutely

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.360
do and if you do play it let me know because i wouldn't know what you think of it it's one of

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:54.320
one of my favorite uh virtual pinball games great there it is your classic game of the week uh jackie

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:59.600
crush uh and i gotta say you know i'm kind of with the chat like i knew of course about aliens

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.800
crush and devil's crush like those are very hard games to miss especially if you followed the

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:08.160
terrific 16 at all um and i'm sure i think i feel like you've probably mentioned this in passing

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:13.760
because i just know you love this series um but i've not really sit down and watched it and listened

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:18.720
to it before and it's pretty cool like i wonder how this one kind of got lost i guess maybe maybe

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.480
it came out and later in the super nintendo's life or something i don't know it was 92.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.440
oh yeah weird i just feel like it didn't come out in the u.s compared to the others

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:32.960
i mean if you think about it this way it's a pinball game number one which is a little bit

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:42.160
more obvious you know a genre for for a video game true and it didn't see the light of day outside of

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.400
japan back in you know those days it was much harder to get those imports and then of course

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.680
by the time importing became the big thing that it is like i didn't buy my first import game until

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:58.080
like 95 yeah i take that back 94 my first import game that i bought was uh the sailor moon s

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:07.840
fighting game um which actually now uh gwen has it i think i think i sold it to gwen um but uh

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:15.200
but going back to it i mean importing was like when i imported my sailor moon game i did it

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:27.040
by literal magazine mail order cod oh my god yeah so um it it's it was a different

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:32.080
is a different world than for for you know importing and we didn't have you know

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.320
emulators at least that were as sophisticated as this in fact i didn't think i actually even

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:49.040
had my first emulated game until maybe the late 90s late late 90s so i mean this game

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:56.480
came out when i was in 10th grade it was that long ago but it's i i mean i i know that i have

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:01.120
certain games that are like oh yeah play it it's fun and something i'm really like you gotta play

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:07.040
i say if you really if you like the the first two crash games you absolutely owe it to yourself to

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:12.240
play this one because this is an excellent game it's a wonderful addition to the series and i

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:17.520
honestly would love for them to put out like a crush compilation that has that kind of like the

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:22.640
monster boy treatment remember where you can switch back and forth between the old mode and

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:30.480
like a new updated mode um and i think that that that would sell i would buy i would buy it or

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.280
where you can play the switch vertically i always thought that was really cool for the um pinball

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:40.560
simulators that do that yeah well i mean the wonders the wondrous one the wondrous one color

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.320
back in the day was set to be played vertical horizontally because a couple of the clindola

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:49.440
games worked that way and you know they could easily do that with the switch but

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:57.680
when when all right opportunities all right there it is your classic game of the week great pick

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:02.560
very very educational for the folks tonight especially if you like pinball fan or if you

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:08.240
like pinball at all or like pinball inspired um games you know of which there's there's been a few

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:13.920
uh through the years you know uh even things like pinball quest or i think of like you know the

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:19.360
translations like uh pinbot and high speed that were so weird on the nes because they did shit

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:25.920
that you can't actually do physically uh and then music yeah which the originals really didn't have

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:32.080
anything like that i i i thought that someone did a rom hack of pinbot to turn it into jackpot i'd

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:38.320
have to take a look for that but the thing the thing with these that are like this in particular

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:44.080
and this is where my point is going on this is that these were made solely they're not a

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:50.800
translation they're not a recreation like you know pinmame or uh or pinball effects or something like

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:59.200
that these are virtual pinball that is meant to be played in that kind of environment it's built

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:07.680
for a console and so you get an experience on a table like that that you cannot get at all unless

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:15.840
you have like again one of those you know uh uh pinmame cabinets that has you know that a game

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:19.600
would be programmed for something like that the closest we even have to i mean that would work

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:25.520
something like that would work if you had where it would just move the the tables back and forth you

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:30.240
know on a virtual screen something like that would work but you also then miss feeling the

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:36.720
ball i guess and being able to control your tilts and whatnot but that's actually one thing i have

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:41.120
to go back and say about demon's tilt is that it actually does have a pretty decent tilt function

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:46.800
in it so um but i i could i could go on about this all day but that's the thing that makes these

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:53.200
games special is that they were programmed this way this is their intent and they're so unique

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:59.520
in that that it it's you can be a fan of pinball you could be a fan of puzzle games i'd put it that

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:06.800
way too and this game is definitely a test of your hand-eye coordination and it's challenging

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:11.440
in a way that conventional pinball isn't well i don't know if you'd want to play this table in

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.520
real life those those demon faces are scary as fuck i'd run out of the building screaming

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:21.280
i don't know i don't think they're that scary but maybe if it was like bleeding all over the place

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:28.320
and yeah maybe all right great pick let's get into some other news uh rapid fire style with

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:36.800
some rapid fire news loki to go to go along with the announcement and release of earthbound on

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:53.760
little blast in the past i remember there's yeah i mean it's just nice to have yeah so let's move

01:33:53.760 --> 01:34:01.680
on yeah so um well shakila neil and arcade one up is doing an nba jam shack edition arcade machine

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:08.320
so uh just in case we haven't had enough uh enough shack going on back in the day we have some new

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:16.000
shack um they are uh they had an announcement at shacks fun house which a concert experience in la

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:23.600
um this weekend um actually they made the announcement on friday but um he is uh gonna

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:30.000
be doing the uh he's actually uh gonna be playing the nba jam on that custom one up and so it will

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:38.400
be a 65.8 inches high uh which is taller than their existing nba jam with a 19-inch screen

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:45.040
wi-fi enabled and three playable games just nba jam nba jam tournament edition and nba hang time

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:53.200
and of course he was in the original nba jam with the orlando magic uh moving on uh cloud from final

01:34:53.200 --> 01:35:01.920
fantasy 7 will be available in chocobo grand prix in their first season pass uh and uh have a 800

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:08.960
mithril login bonus oh my gosh this model is so freaking cute um like how can you be an adorable

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:18.560
chibi and still look that constipated seriously um but anyway um he is a season pass exclusive

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.040
so if you were playing that go for it

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:30.400
i just don't like that i'm hearing about 800 mithril season pass and i'm like oh god how much

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:36.240
you know games as a service crap are they loading into this because i was really looking forward to

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:40.560
this but i'm not looking forward to all these microtransactions is it a free-to-play game

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.600
oh is it oh i didn't know i thought i just assumed it was a purchase game

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:52.080
if it's free to play i guess it's a little less annoying i like i like it's having options like

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.080
the free-to-play mmos but if you pay the subscription and you get a few bells and whistles

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:03.360
you know something like that is perfectly acceptable no all right um let us travel around

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:07.680
the world and check out some games that are coming out probably sooner than chocobo gp

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:13.200
because they're coming out this week and we'll start in the us uh to clarify apparently chocobo

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:18.480
grand prix is going to be on the switch as a full game or they're going to have a free-to-play

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:30.320

then on the 18th we have horizon forbidden west on playstation and that is it we have a lot of

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:11.280
common threads all throughout the world this week so busy week all right let's get into some more

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:16.240
stories and then we'll be taking your questions and your calls um i know the live turnout is a

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:22.320
little lighter tonight can't imagine why uh but we'll get to those that want to um uh participate

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:27.600
further with the show in our listener round table in a little bit uh but first loki it take to be

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:33.600
working on a new midnight club game some people like to think so because the developer visual

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:41.600
concepts who has worked on the nba 2k and wwe 2k series they are recruiting for an open world

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:46.080
driving game and immediately everyone thinks midnight club because you know rockstar has

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:53.120
that and stuff the work could be a new ip we don't know but there is a new driving game coming from

01:39:53.120 --> 01:40:02.240
take two so we'll just have to see what it is at some point will it be midnight club who knows

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:06.400
how would you feel about a new midnight club it's not rockstar working on it i'm kind of

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:14.800
disappointed with that but meh whatever it's been a long time yeah it's been a while so i i

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:19.600
want i don't want to see some video see it in motion see what it looks like all right yeah

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:27.200
definitely dark sakura so uh there is a series that i i would probably say a lot of uh people

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:34.480
who are into import games especially dating sims know very well um tokimeki memorial which is uh

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:42.160
konami's a big dating sim it was the big one that everyone knew about um so there is an independent

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:50.800
uh retro game translator known as retro translator that um has uh his team working uh has sorry their

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.800
their team working on translating uh one of the tokimeki memorial games into english and it's

01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:05.760
almost complete but here is uh the thing it is not uh tokimeki memorial forever with me which

01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:09.040
is like the playstation one the one that everybody likes it was the one that was like the best

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:16.480
improved of them it's the snes one or the super famicom one uh which is uh tokimeki memorial

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:23.680
which translates to heartthrob memorial under the tree of legends you know i actually have

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:34.400
the tokimeki memorial oav on laserdisc um but it's it this is the big game i think that brought

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:42.960
dating sims to the fore like i mean they were already kind of big in in japan um and the i'm

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.440
sorry it's not forever with me it's forever with you um it was actually the upgraded version from

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:55.440
the pc engine super cd rom one the turbo graphic cd the snes one came out after the playstation one

01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.480
and uh it didn't have any voice acting of course because it was this mess and it was just like

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:10.080
really watered down um so this is this is this is a toki memo that is just really not the one

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:15.200
that everyone wanted of course you know i think it would be easier to do a translate a translated

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:25.600
copy of the the snus one which for the record several already exist just saying um i yeah

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:34.400
um on top of that too you know some other people are like well why not do uh toki memo pocket you

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:42.160
know the one of the uh uh you know a handheld one to bring with it but at the same time you know

01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:48.960
it is what it is for some people this is going to be the way that people start off with toki memo

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:56.880
um i personally would uh would like to see a translation uh an official release of uh

01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:02.240
toki memo girl side where basically you play one of the female characters dating the boys

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:09.600
you know which as i was i thought it was pretty cool that you know in all of the world of boy

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:16.480
date girl you know dating sim thing they did in the toki memo series they did one where the girls

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:24.160
can go after the boys um i mean now of course we have a slew of you know various different

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:32.240
options for for dating sims including the very popular uh boyfriend dungeon and uh dream daddy

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:40.240
and uh uh the colonel sanders game which i still need to play blink blink but i i think

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:47.520
i'm glad i'm glad it's being done i'm not trying to to uh poopoo on the attempt it's just there's

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:52.480
better toki memo games to do the playstation one would have been absolutely astounding to have

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:57.840
just even the japanese voice acting is fine you know but have it translated into english you get

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:06.240
an authentic experience but in dialogue that you know that a westerner can understand

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:13.520
i'm sure also just i think you kind of addressed it just the tools kind of being easier and a

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:17.600
little more accessible for the super nintendo probably made it the one that was just like

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:22.800
the easier one to translate maybe so but hey making the game available for more people to

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:28.960
try out but like you said i guess translations already exist so but well there there are a few

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:36.800
other um fan translations that are coming out sort of a quote officially uh one of them is uh there

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:43.840
was a japanese exclusive yakuza game that came out on psp um that's called uh yakuza black panther in

01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:55.440
english or uh i'm gonna mispronounce this uh um which yeah because a black panther um and then

01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:04.880
uh another game called uh miser uh miserna falls so it's a ps1 game that where you can pet a dog

01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:10.400
apparently that's uh that's getting a fan translation too um i also thought it was very

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:18.320
interesting that there's a fan translation out for uh the biohazard uh 1.5 almost a fully playable

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:23.440
version so pretty cool what a lot of like you know modders and translators are doing to make

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:27.680
more of these games playable by more people around the world pretty cool power of boredom and wanting

01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:32.400
to play a game yeah well meanwhile while these folks work on new technologies and new things

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:36.640
that are great for games we have other big companies doing the exact opposite right loki

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:45.680
yes it's your weekly disappointment in the game industry your depression if you will of

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:53.840
the future that is coming the unwanted nft future that ubisoft is just running full speed ahead

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:59.440
into a wall with um so apparently one of the things that ubisoft is doing is they're

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:08.720
collaborating with the sandbox which is a game if you will um that's more of like a virtual space

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:14.960
that you can buy real estate in and walk around with avatar it basically looks like playstation

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:20.480
home if they monetize the crap out of it and made it blockchain made it stupid um so that's kind of

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:26.240
what that is and of course ubisoft's like yep sign me up for that uh so they've brought the

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:32.400
rabbits to it because everybody needs that um and then of course you know ubisoft employees

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:39.120
are still telling um their you know higher ups that nft suck and that they really shouldn't be

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:46.320
in that business um you know one of the there's some fun comments from the ubisoft employees like

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:52.000
are we competing with ea for the most hated game studio by the public uh because this is how you do

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:58.880
it i think the kids call this entire comment session um being ratioed um you know what else

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:05.280
makes a lot of money uh making fun spectacular groundbreaking blockbusters why don't we focus

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:10.720
on that instead you know what else is great in the company not sexually harassing your employees

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:17.040
but hey you know ubisoft gonna ubisoft so what can you do they just just play by some different

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:22.320
rules that's all you know if they could meant sexual harassment into the blockchain i'm sure

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:27.840
they would try to do that as well uh uh as she 100 matt and chad says i love that ubisoft's

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:33.680
internal employee forum was filled of employees dunking on the company's stance on nfts hey

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.320
that's why and you know shout out to those frontline employees at ubisoft that are fighting

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:42.800
the good fight on the inside because you know we've said this time and time again these stupid

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:47.840
decisions are never the fault of the hard-working you know frontline creators of these games it's

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:53.120
always some dumb fuck executive who shouldn't even be in this business uh who's making these calls and

01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:58.640
it's it's very apparently clear with what you see with what's going on at ubisoft and uh good on

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:08.000
them for ray showing uh these these stupid things that people don't want um if yeah anyway um and

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.520
then of course a little bit more details regarding the whole team 17 worms nft announcement thing

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:18.640
that we kind of talked about i think last week um talking about how basically the employees

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:25.200
had no idea that this was even happening aside from the higher ups um you know and the qa

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:32.320
developers of course at team 17 are really not paid very well between 20 000 25 000 annually

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:39.280
and while they're yeah and so while they're struggling to pay bills you know there is

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:44.160
people that um they're going out there and trying to make a few extra bucks off of some

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:54.080
of their assets from the company so obviously um that's not a good look so wow yeah all right

01:48:54.800 --> 01:49:00.480
uh well uh let's hope these ubisoft executives i get put in their place real soon and stop driving

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:03.360
the company in this direction or they're going to just drive them right out of business

01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:10.160
um for our last uh official story tonight i thought this was a fun one to go out on uh

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:16.560
the fact that uh maim uh known as the multiple arcade machine emulator is what maim stands for

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:24.480
uh just turned 25 years old uh believe it or not its debut was the feb February 5th of 1997

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:29.280
if you've never heard of maim that's kind of surprising uh it's an emulator that runs all

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:36.240
sorts of old um arcade emulation uh and a lot of a lot of stuff than throughout the years i remember

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:41.040
i mean i'm dating myself obviously but whatever i remember being around when maim kind of first came

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:46.400
out and it was a lot of the really old like namco boards and atari boards where they first started

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:51.040
but then obviously you know maim started to get into you know newer and newer stuff when they

01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:56.640
started getting stuff like street fighter 2 and uh mortal combat and then you know even beyond that

01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:01.120
uh it really became its own thing and of course i wish that they could still do the hikaru

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:06.720
software that would have been amazing uh of course maim does state on the official maim website their

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:13.200
purpose is to preserve decades of software history uh and maim prevents important vintage software

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:18.400
from being lost and forgotten uh achieved by documenting the hardware and how it functions

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.440
the source code to maim serves as this documentation so um yeah again you know a lot

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:28.320
of people might jump to oh these bad things you know maim leads to piracy and all that but

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:33.040
you know again there's a lot of rights and a lot of things that get lost out there throughout the

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:37.920
years also games are just not available i mean like where are you going to find like it it's

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:42.720
like if you want a certain type i mean granted they have you know arcade went up for a lot of

01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:47.600
things but there's a lot of games that are very obscure out there that good luck finding hardware

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:54.480
for that and some old creators from the 80s uh made public domain their roms basically who had

01:50:54.480 --> 01:51:00.000
the right rights and license to do so and were like yeah maim's pretty cool and so you can uh

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:05.200
distribute this however much you want so there are there are there is a set i don't know how

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:10.560
many games are uh technically public domain but there's a set of you know at least 10 games

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:15.200
probably more at this point it's been a while since i've looked that are absolutely free to

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:18.960
get maim and use them and have fun with it and experience some old arcade games

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:25.200
and then what also was interesting about this uh the 2021 release capcom arcade stadium which is

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:32.560
relatively i have that on the switch apparently it was using code from maim in it so not a huge

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:37.360
surprise i'm sure uh interesting how that's come full circle the surprise was they actually

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:43.920
credited them which is nice yeah that is true yeah that is nice so but also apartment just being a

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:49.920
nice gesture it also does sort of cover their tail legally right because i remember i feel

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:56.640
like there was something that didn't do that and it became it was oh yeah yeah no i thought there

01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:00.400
was something that's obs yes but i thought there was something involving maim too but yeah that

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:07.200
was a kind of an adjacent issue for sure yeah it's the same thing you know if they had they

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:11.680
weren't supposed to use obs in the name or they were supposed to credit or something and none of

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:16.320
that happened uh dart to see is talking about the public domain games talking about robbie

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:20.800
roto off the top of my head but there's a few others yeah i think that's the one um they

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:27.680
released that uh on like the of the phone stores and uh that's the it was a full running copy of

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:33.760
maim that they and you were able to load it basically on your um uh devices and play games

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:38.640
that way that's how i have uh on my ipad my old ass ipad at this point uh a version of maim

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:45.040
basically is uh from from that being available for like a week uh but orange right says maim

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:51.280
preserves so many games that we would have never heard of absolutely uh dart says uh capcom arts

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:56.160
arcade stadium has its issues but i do fire it up now and then for some classic arcade fun yeah

01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:00.480
it's it's like everything else i've talked about when they do like legal versions especially when

01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:04.800
they you know enhance it a little bit which you know capcom arcade stadium has like the achievements

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:09.120
the online leaderboards you know they they some different graphical ways of looking at it they

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:13.840
tried to sweeten the pot a little bit i supported it because i like retro gaming it's fun and i like

01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:18.320
when the companies dip into their back catalogs i wish there would be another midway arcade treasures

01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:22.400
collections there's some really good stuff in there but um we haven't seen those releases in

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:33.760
a very long time so holy crap hmm ivan reitman died oh gosh yeah i i i just saw the the posting

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:40.720
about it from associated press it's like just now huh well i didn't mean to derail everything with

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:50.800
it but uh but yeah wow no that's fine wow all right time to watch ghostbusters yeah gosh okay

01:53:51.440 --> 01:54:00.240
uh moving on let's get to our listener round table uh we invite your uh emails at participate

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:06.160
orange lounge radio.com and i think i saw one come in uh we do have one so let's get to it let's get

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:13.520
to our emails first so it's one email and you'll know who it is email singular and you'll know who

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:22.240
it is the moment i start reading it you ready hello lr hi it's been a while but i've been

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:27.360
listening to the podcast for just about this whole time congratulations rob to you and alan on the

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:33.600
new place i'm looking forward to seeing the new studio smiley face rob you were right we you did

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:38.720
in fact release in november of 2012 when it launched with a really really fun tech demo

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:46.640
a 2d mario game and a bunch of third-party games that would most likely uh already played on other

01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:51.920
platforms i would argue that the unexciting launch lineup and the many long stretches between big

01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:57.280
game releases did as much to hurt the wii u as its awful name i kept defending that name you

01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:04.800
know that and i still kind of defend it um despite this i do still actively have mine hooked up

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:12.080
primarily for don't laugh at me we fit you that now that name is funny i'm just saying no i i and

01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:16.240
i wouldn't laugh at that either i mean it was a great fitness title right yeah i know i know a

01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:21.600
lot of people have kind of graduated for lack of a better term to ring fit but i also know it's a

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:27.040
different like ring fit and we fit you are are very different games so um no i don't i don't

01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.880
fault you i'm not gonna laugh at you for keeping that hooked up and i um and i have a hard time

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:39.680
believing that switch sports will top we sports club but i guess we'll see soon enough i was

01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:44.240
delighted that wolfenstein 3d was mentioned during the classic game of the week segment recently

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:48.960
i was also happy to hear that both the mac version and the modding community were mentioned you

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:53.680
probably already know this if you watched my yyr game's 10th anniversary retrospective videos but

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:59.920
only a handful of people did so i'll tell you that i was a member of wolf addict software the largest

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:06.720
modding group for the mac version during the mid to late 90s 1990s we actually sold several scenarios

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:11.280
created by our members including new levels graphics audio and more because the mac version

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.720
of wolf 3d came out later it featured higher resolution graphics and an engine capable

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:22.560
of more things than the original it was super fun to be a part of this but what's really surprising

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.920
is that there is currently an ongoing effort to bring the mac wolfenstein 3d mods back to modern

01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:34.160
systems it's called mac and wolf and i highly recommend that you google it if you are interested

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:41.200
in checking out some vintage classic gameplay that's m a c e n wolf have fun everyone i'll end

01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:47.120
on this note i am normally an optimist so um and i would normally never cast doubt on something

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:52.800
i truly love but i am sorry to say that unless olr moves to a more frequent broadcast schedule

01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:59.520
it will never reach episode 9000 with its current hosts well that is unless you're good to go for

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:06.880
another 156 years or more if you miss more than a few weeks um i'm sorry to have to deliver the

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:12.320
bad news but honestly thank you for another week of this show that we all enjoy so much and enjoy

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:18.560
your week off looking forward to whatever is next erin yyr well you know we can number these

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:23.440
episodes however the fuck we want to so when we numbering is arbitrary when we want to do episode

01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:28.880
9000 we will well you know and and you know um there's another podcast out there um gamertag

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:35.840
radio who crossed a thousand episodes even though um they started two three years after we did sorry

01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:39.600
i don't know the exact day is not i'm certainly not here to shade anybody there's a lot of work

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:44.880
that went into that um danny and the crew over there work very hard on what they do um but they

01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:50.560
also put out multiple episodes a week and i think during e3 a lot of episodes like usually like

01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:55.040
historically so um they were kind of able to and so a lot of people assume that that is the longest

01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:02.240
running show because they have more episodes um we could have there was a time when i was uh

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:06.080
clipping up some of you may remember this some of you longtime listeners where i was clipping up

01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:11.680
olr and i was putting out the first half on the feed on like monday and the second half on like

01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:17.600
wednesday to try to kind of fill the week but the big feedback i got after about a year was like

01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:21.920
stop doing that we just want to listen to it all in one you know go and i did kind of go like why

01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:26.960
am i doing that but it's funny because you know maybe if i counted those as separate episodes

01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:30.960
we would have hit a thousand by now but i'm not out to yuck somebody's yum like it's just you know

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:36.240
it is what it is we've done a we've done a weekly thing and and uh pissing in the cornflakes exactly

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:45.280
exactly so um but uh if but i guess my point is aaron if you do want us to hit uh 9 000 episodes

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:49.920
i guess i could start uh chopping up the show into five minute chunks and releasing those all

01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:54.880
as separate episodes but i'm not sure what the podcast folks would think about that so uh pod

01:58:54.880 --> 01:59:00.640
culture says there was also olr to go the interesting thing about that is that um before

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:09.040
the shows merged so our live show in the podcast merged around episode 180 i want to say question

01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:14.160
mark it's probably on the wiki somewhere so yeah technically there were 50 episodes or so of the

01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:21.200
show that weren't like counted accounted for somewhere else but i think there would be other

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:25.840
people that would argue well the shows that weren't actually a podcast that we did on live

01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:31.120
365 shouldn't be counted and i i beg to differ because they exist and we've been doing them but

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:37.200
again it's just it's it's arbitrary just like dark soccer said it's all in what you choose to

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:43.040
do and how you want to do it so uh as 200 matt says each story is an episode you'll hit 9000

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:50.080
no problem uh and yes dark to see absolutely he just wants the chance to make the over 9000 joke

01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:55.600
absolutely um you know what one of these days over 9000 words spoken that's right

01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:07.120
so where are we on that uh uh the guinness thing i already they they sent it back remember oh

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:12.720
because we have to do it as a as a company i didn't resubmit because i we need to have uh the

02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:20.320
like some sort of company way to do it i think we could probably submit it under vog network but i

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.400
think there'd be a charge with that so we'd have to figure that out there's there's still going to

02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:29.120
be a free when the charge comes if you want the accelerated application oh okay um maybe we can

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:35.200
do that then i'm i've got to dig into it but i've had real life stuff going on too so it might my

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:39.840
health issues have taken priority because i'm still dealing with that whole uh narcolepsy

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:47.760
diagnosis crap all right uh yeah pod culture i remember that we'd record pod culture in a chunk

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:52.800
and i'd chop it up yeah and it just you know it just is all depends on how you want to do it no

02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:59.120
no biggie all right um let's see uh let me i didn't check discord to see if we had any callers over

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:03.680
there if you want to give us a call you can just head on over to vog network.com discord and join

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:08.720
our green room uh nobody's there now and i know we just we just have a smaller turnout live tonight

02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:12.960
because of things that are going on on television even though my understanding is it's over now

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:16.640
but i'm sure folks are still with their you know friends family and people they hang out with on

02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:21.200
days like today so it's probably just going to be more of a podcast heavy week and that's okay too

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:26.000
we love our podcast audience feel free to say hi to us either on social media like twitter's

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.280
a great place to say hi at olr uh and of course the email bag as well like aaron did this week

02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:36.960
participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us an email uh let me check in

02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:42.480
with loki and see if there's any last minute stories yes there is one so there's a game coming

02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:50.320
out called martha is dead um it's coming out on pc playstation and saw this on discord yeah

02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:56.720
so on the playstation version they're actually censoring the game uh because there's a very

02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:02.320
sensitive scene that's being depicted in the game um spoilers they cut off someone's face and then

02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:08.480
put it on um so that apparently is not going to be on the playstation five and playstation

02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:16.560
four versions um but the other versions will be just fine this game sounds like a bit much for me

02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:22.320
yeah it sounds like that said though like they had really violent stuff though in like last of

02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:27.520
us two and stuff so like did they cut off someone's face i don't know i didn't play last

02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:30.960
wasn't there also something about like the sister

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:36.960
it's there was something like really weird sounding and i was just like this game isn't

02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:42.320
for me that's all i was i read it i was like this game isn't for me um sj100 matt in chat says people

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:49.600
are so mad about this well then don't buy it on playstation yeah it's like it's pretty simple um

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:57.760
sia tabirian chat says it's not as if they were renaming at martha's badly maimed uh fifth dream

02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:04.160
says oh it's your sister's face that's gross what a weird game but what i hey y'all are into whatever

02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:09.760
you're into enjoy your horror porn if that's your thing i will be watching over here off once

02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:16.800
already so it's it's all good i think that was a little different all right uh if there's no other

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.720
last minute stories then i think we will move to close up shop tonight i know it's a little

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:27.040
bit earlier we still broke two hours but um it is what it is so uh let's go around and wrap things

02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:31.280

02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:06.960

02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:12.800

02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:17.520
guess i'll i'll change the shot here and you may see some unsightly things in the shot oh no it's

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:24.720
still pretty in pretty decent shape here but uh there it is uh the studio and uh the last hurrah

02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:30.240
from this particular studio that served us well um over these last few years about seven years

02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:35.440
uh thank you all for being a part of it whether uh you've been here on twitch uh as we made the

02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:40.880
transition to go to video on twitch or whether you were here through the uh um uh shoutcast

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:44.960
years as well because this place was really only set up to do audio uh but we've seen all the

02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:50.160
changes and so forth as well so a big farewell to studio and seven i am really looking forward

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:56.160
to the future though i appreciate everyone's support as we get there uh i know uh some people

02:05:56.160 --> 02:06:00.560
really want us to all be back in person uh it's just one of those things we'll have to play by ear

02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:04.480
because again the new space is going to be a little weird for that especially with twitch

02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:09.120
um but we'll see i think we're still having fun here um the way we're doing things i really can't

02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:14.400
wait to be in the next space though and i'm really excited to share it all with you um so i'll see

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:20.480
you in two weeks if not maybe a little sooner on my personal feed we'll see maybe maybe but no

02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:26.800
