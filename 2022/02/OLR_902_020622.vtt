00:00.000 --> 00:13.320
I've frequently stated how the Wii's runaway success was due largely to Wii Sports and

00:13.320 --> 00:17.080
casual game buyers, and how Wii U's disappointing sales weren't disappointing, they just weren't

00:17.080 --> 00:18.880
the lightning in a bottle that the Wii was.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.080
If that's true, then how has the Nintendo Switch exceeded Wii's console sales?

00:22.080 --> 00:25.280
Is it the appeal of the docked and mobile switching nature, 2-in-1 value?

00:25.280 --> 00:28.800
Has the depth of the game library been valuable for every Nintendo target demographic?

00:28.800 --> 00:30.240
These are questions I've asked rhetorically.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.520
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give you the underlying

00:33.520 --> 00:36.280
numbers and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

00:36.280 --> 00:37.280
every gamer has a voice.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.280
Hello, my friends out there on this internet.

00:38.280 --> 00:48.120
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:48.120 --> 00:55.480
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again, episode number 902 of our show

00:55.480 --> 00:59.760
for this February the 8th of 2022.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.720
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined by my co-hosts.

01:03.720 --> 01:08.160
Say hello as always to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.160
Hello.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.160
Hi.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.160
How are you?

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
I'm okay.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.160
Good.

01:13.160 --> 01:18.880
I'm having OBS problems tonight for some weird reason, and I'm seeing something completely

01:18.880 --> 01:20.680
different other than...

01:20.680 --> 01:21.680
There you are.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.680
Hello.

01:22.680 --> 01:23.680
Okay.

01:23.680 --> 01:24.680
Whew.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.880
And all the joy will be when we...

01:26.880 --> 01:27.880
I've been here.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.880
No, I know you have.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.440
It was showing something else on my screen.

01:31.440 --> 01:36.240
So all the joy is when we broadcast live here at the Voice Geeks Network, because we do tape

01:36.240 --> 01:40.400
live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

01:40.400 --> 01:45.320
show at the Voice Geeks Network on Twitch, twitch.tv slash V-O-G network.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.120
Did I leave anything out?

01:47.120 --> 01:51.760
No, I think I got it all.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.800
Next week is the decommissioning of Studio N7.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.960
Do you have any favorite Studio N7 memories, Dark Sakura?

01:59.960 --> 02:00.960
Coffee.

02:00.960 --> 02:01.960
Coffee.

02:01.960 --> 02:02.960
Oh yeah.

02:02.960 --> 02:03.960
Making a lot, because...

02:03.960 --> 02:07.880
I don't have coffee tonight, because husband said you might go to Starbucks.

02:07.880 --> 02:08.880
Yeah.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.880
Mr. Smoosh says snort.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.200
But yeah, hopefully you can come see the new play.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.920
Of course, for those that missed the news, Alan and I are moving to a new place.

02:18.920 --> 02:24.680
So this studio will be no more after really next week's episode is going to be the last

02:24.680 --> 02:25.680
one.

02:25.680 --> 02:32.000
So it'll be the last chance to celebrate a lot of shows from this studio.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.640
And because honestly, the transition from us being on Shoutcast to Twitch to virtual

02:38.640 --> 02:40.560
kind of all happened here.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.520
So it's been a lot of change for the show here.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.520
Also say hello tonight to Techmaster Loki.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
Hello.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.520
Hey, Loki.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.120
What's that game playing behind you tonight?

02:50.120 --> 02:51.120
I'm trying to see.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.120
Lil Nemo.

02:52.120 --> 02:57.640
Oh my gosh, I haven't played that game in a very long time.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.640
What made you want to play that?

02:58.640 --> 03:01.240
Or what made you think of that one for your background tonight?

03:01.240 --> 03:04.520
I don't know.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.520
So many games I've already picked.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.720
I was like, I gotta pick something different.

03:07.720 --> 03:08.720
Sure, sure.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.720
I understand.

03:09.720 --> 03:15.320
Hey, I know you had an update to give on a frequent guest contributor to the program.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.320
Yeah.

03:17.120 --> 03:20.720
So it's been a rough week.

03:20.720 --> 03:27.220
So I found out that the sickness I had last week that we thought was not COVID was COVID.

03:27.220 --> 03:31.800
So there's that, which is fun.

03:31.800 --> 03:42.140
So unfortunately, I knew last week that we were going to schedule my cat to be put down.

03:42.140 --> 03:51.380
And so it's just her health had been kind of, not like getting, it had been gradually

03:51.380 --> 03:52.380
getting worse.

03:52.380 --> 03:59.140
She's been losing weight for, oh gosh, like at least a year and a half.

03:59.140 --> 04:03.660
She was down to under probably around five pounds at the time.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.340
Just all skin and bones, basically.

04:06.340 --> 04:11.700
No matter what we would try to give her, it wasn't really doing anything.

04:11.700 --> 04:17.300
And no, she's just, they didn't know what was wrong with her.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.660
She had neurological problems at one point.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.540
We thought that she might have had a stroke because she was kind of circling in certain

04:23.540 --> 04:24.540
directions.

04:24.540 --> 04:30.000
That seemed to get better, because I thought she was going blind to it for a while.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.780
But then, so we just made the choice that's like, okay, it's not getting any better.

04:35.780 --> 04:37.380
It's something we can really do for her.

04:37.380 --> 04:44.740
We had some pretty rough weeks where she was just throwing up and diarrhea and all that

04:44.740 --> 04:45.740
stuff.

04:45.740 --> 04:46.740
She stopped grooming herself.

04:46.740 --> 04:51.180
So yeah, unfortunately on a Thursday, we had to put her down.

04:51.180 --> 04:52.180
Yeah.

04:52.180 --> 04:53.440
I'm really sorry to hear that.

04:53.440 --> 04:59.540
And I know that's not an easy decision, but I know you did what's right for Stella and

04:59.540 --> 05:01.620
it was probably a lot harder for you.

05:01.620 --> 05:08.080
It was especially hard knowing that I knew when it was going to happen.

05:08.080 --> 05:16.780
So I had four days to like, so I just try to spend as much time with her as I could.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.420
And good on you doing that.

05:18.420 --> 05:23.440
So many pets don't get to have a great home and a great place to be, but you certainly

05:23.440 --> 05:24.440
gave her one.

05:24.440 --> 05:31.300
So I think she's very appreciative for that, as is anybody who is a lover of cats for sure.

05:31.300 --> 05:34.940
And nothing but love coming from our chat room right now, of course.

05:34.940 --> 05:35.940
Yeah.

05:35.940 --> 05:40.900
And it's just still, it's getting used to, I still like, you know, as I'm sitting here

05:40.900 --> 05:45.060
at my desk, I'm like, Oh, I better not, like, I better put my foot a certain way so it'll

05:45.060 --> 05:47.220
kick her in the head and she's not there.

05:47.220 --> 05:49.820
So it's like, it's tough.

05:49.820 --> 05:53.660
And then I can't even imagine, I was like that with, with Shermy.

05:53.660 --> 05:54.660
Yeah.

05:54.660 --> 05:57.860
And I can't even imagine having to deal with COVID on top of all of that.

05:57.860 --> 06:01.260
So just, you've, you've had a rough, I'm actually kind of surprised.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.260
You're here.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.540
You've had a rough week.

06:04.540 --> 06:09.040
But I hope, I hope the show can help take your mind off it a little bit, but yeah, it's

06:09.040 --> 06:10.380
been getting easier every day.

06:10.380 --> 06:14.060
It's just, you know, it's tough.

06:14.060 --> 06:18.540
But I'm sure our listeners, I know I do, are thankful, you know, this, this whole virtual

06:18.540 --> 06:20.700
setup wasn't supposed to happen.

06:20.700 --> 06:25.100
It wasn't supposed to go like this two years ago, but I'm glad that we were able to meet

06:25.100 --> 06:29.780
Stella and I'm glad you were able to kind of share her with so many people throughout,

06:29.780 --> 06:30.780
you know, the world.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.140
Thanks to what we do here on Sunday nights and our little show.

06:34.140 --> 06:38.880
So lots of people, lots of people feeling that in a chat.

06:38.880 --> 06:42.980
And as Bobby Blackwolf puts it, we can shit post about video games for the next few hours

06:42.980 --> 06:44.380
to take your mind off it.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.580
Sounds good.

06:45.580 --> 06:49.780
And SSJ100Matt with a nice thing that's kind of sums up a lot of the comments and chats

06:49.780 --> 06:54.340
saying, RIP Stella, you and your family gave her a wonderful life and she shared so much

06:54.340 --> 06:55.340
love to you guys.

06:55.340 --> 06:56.340
She did the right thing.

06:56.340 --> 06:57.340
Yeah.

06:57.340 --> 06:58.340
All right.

06:58.340 --> 06:59.500
Well, let's go ahead.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
We're going to move on.

07:01.220 --> 07:02.420
We're going to get into our kickoff topic for the night.

07:02.420 --> 07:03.820
Actually, I kind of have two things.

07:03.820 --> 07:07.020
I have a quick thing for the top of the show before we get into the main kickoff topic

07:07.020 --> 07:08.820
that is up on the board.

07:08.820 --> 07:14.020
I am sometimes I get messages from people that listen to the show and friend, you know,

07:14.020 --> 07:16.180
people become my friends from the show.

07:16.180 --> 07:18.700
I'm a normal person, just like everybody else out there.

07:18.700 --> 07:23.400
Well, I've got problems, but don't we all I'm just normal here, right?

07:23.400 --> 07:27.500
So like, you know, people will message me and, you know, I do try to respond best I

07:27.500 --> 07:28.500
can.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.980
I'm really bad and my husband will be the first.

07:30.980 --> 07:35.900
I'm really bad about reading a message and then oops, I got distracted during something

07:35.900 --> 07:37.500
else and I never get around to responding.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.980
I am really bad at that, especially if you message me during the show.

07:41.980 --> 07:47.060
I am trying to do something else right now, but I get DMS on Twitter.

07:47.060 --> 07:52.500
I get, you know, messages on Facebook and, you know, sometimes it's questions about video

07:52.500 --> 07:55.020
games or what's my hot take on a certain thing.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.040
And I'll, you know, give my hot take.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.960
This one though kind of made me go, ooh, I should talk about that on OLR.

08:00.960 --> 08:05.740
So I got a message on Facebook that said, and I guess I can just say it's from Codeman

08:05.740 --> 08:12.400
who used to be here live, but I guess I think he's been a listener for a long time.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.060
I think he just more listens on the podcast feed these days than live.

08:16.060 --> 08:20.840
So a Codeman sent me a message that was like, hey, honest question, does this Pokemon game

08:20.840 --> 08:23.280
seem rushed to you?

08:23.280 --> 08:26.760
And we were talking, you know, because we've talked a little bit on the show about Pokemon

08:26.760 --> 08:30.940
Legends and I was talking about my review last week about my impressions and I really

08:30.940 --> 08:33.200
do enjoy it as a Pokemon game.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.580
And honestly, now here we are another week into it.

08:35.580 --> 08:39.480
And I actually said, I need a little more time with this, but I think this might be

08:39.480 --> 08:42.040
my favorite Pokemon game they've done yet.

08:42.040 --> 08:45.800
And I think I'm at the point where I can say, yes, this is my favorite Pokemon game they've

08:45.800 --> 08:47.040
done yet.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.360
That doesn't mean it's without its flaws.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.840
And as I pointed out last week, a lot of that is in the technical space, right?

08:52.840 --> 08:59.000
It looks like a PlayStation 3 RPG with, you know, a lot of the waves, the scenery looks

08:59.000 --> 09:00.360
and things like that.

09:00.360 --> 09:06.760
And I think it just falls into the hands of the ever long running joke that Nintendo just

09:06.760 --> 09:11.920
can't compete in the technological department, but especially so the Pokemon company and

09:11.920 --> 09:14.500
Game Freak.

09:14.500 --> 09:18.040
And it was interesting because, you know, I gave my kind of take on this and I'll give

09:18.040 --> 09:19.600
it to you guys in a minute.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.120
But then Codeman kind of pointed out, I've noticed that Sword and Shield look drastically

09:24.120 --> 09:26.480
better graphics wise than this game.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.360
That's why I asked now.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.720
And I agree, Sword and Shield was a better looking game.

09:31.720 --> 09:35.680
It is a little bit apple to oranges in the fact that, you know, while, yes, Sword and

09:35.680 --> 09:41.840
Shield had very wide open areas, it was a very different sort of open area than I think

09:41.840 --> 09:43.360
what we get in this game.

09:43.360 --> 09:47.240
And I think that should be noted as to, you know,

09:47.760 --> 09:51.920
Sword and Shield struggle with like some of those open areas, like didn't like wasn't

09:51.920 --> 09:56.720
the game pretty solid, but like when you got to those big open areas is like kind of chugging

09:56.720 --> 09:57.720
a bit.

09:57.720 --> 10:03.860
Sometimes I think I think also docked versus handheld would play into that a little bit.

10:03.860 --> 10:05.320
And I only play docked.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.360
So and usually the game will stutter more in handheld.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.760
I pretty much only play games in docked mode on the switch.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.000
So it's hard for me.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.960
But yes, I mean, even Sword and Shield kind of plays into the old argument of LOL, Nintendo

10:19.960 --> 10:22.520
doesn't make technologically great games.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.800
But then, you know, Breath of the Wild exists and it existed on the Wii U.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.240
So that is very true, right?

10:30.240 --> 10:31.240
Absolutely.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.720
And and, you know, folks in chat, of course, jumping right in.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.640
Mike Deff says it's not perfect, but what it does, it does so good.

10:37.640 --> 10:38.640
And I absolutely agree.

10:38.640 --> 10:42.120
And again, I just said this is probably my favorite Pokemon game.

10:42.240 --> 10:47.120
I mean, yes, we can kind of say technologically, it's got some issues, but you know what?

10:47.120 --> 10:49.320
At the end of the day, does it really matter?

10:49.320 --> 10:53.000
Eh, no, but I think a lot of us just kind of look at it.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.840
And I said this last week, but I'm going to reiterate the frustrating part is that we

10:57.840 --> 10:58.840
look at it.

10:58.840 --> 11:03.880
We see the potential because we see the, I don't know, Horizon Forbidden West of the

11:03.880 --> 11:04.880
world.

11:04.880 --> 11:08.640
We see the Forza Horizon fives of the world.

11:08.640 --> 11:13.400
We see all these, actually, wait, did I just add an extra Forza Horizon game?

11:13.400 --> 11:14.400
I think I did.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
But someday there'll be a five.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.640
I think I just added another game in the series.

11:19.640 --> 11:23.680
We all know it's coming, but we all see the Forza Horizon series of the world and we see

11:23.680 --> 11:29.000
all these games and it's like, why can't Nintendo be that?

11:29.000 --> 11:34.960
And to quote a famous drag queen, you will never be glamour.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.480
And I think Nintendo is kind of okay being that.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.480
Okay.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.720
I'm losing track of games.

11:40.720 --> 11:41.720
Thank you, Bobby.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.520
Bobby says Forza Horizon 5 is the current game.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.240
I had to like count in my head.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.240
Okay.

11:46.240 --> 11:51.520
Anyway, you know what I was, the point I was getting at though is that Pokemon Legends

11:51.520 --> 11:53.260
Arceus isn't that.

11:53.260 --> 11:56.240
It's not that in the graphical sense.

11:56.240 --> 12:00.000
So the question, I want to go back to the question that Codeman raised is that does

12:00.000 --> 12:02.720
this Pokemon game seem rushed to you?

12:02.720 --> 12:07.440
And my answer is no, but, and here's the real hot take.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.960
And I want to see what you all think of this hot take.

12:09.960 --> 12:17.140
Can you rate this hot take on a scale of one to 10, 10 being like pipe and spicy hot and

12:17.140 --> 12:19.560
one being like cold McDonald's fries.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.560
Okay.

12:20.560 --> 12:26.120
So what do you, what do you think of this hot take and my hot take is, I don't think

12:26.120 --> 12:32.800
it was rushed, but I think the scope of the game changed because I think the reason why

12:32.800 --> 12:37.400
this game isn't technologically pushing the way it ought to is because it was originally

12:37.400 --> 12:42.280
designed to be the launch game for the Switch Pro.

12:42.280 --> 12:46.600
And when the Switch Pro suddenly didn't happen because of chip shortage, well I shouldn't

12:46.600 --> 12:50.800
say suddenly didn't happen because I think that's been in the making for a while.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.840
I think when it didn't happen because of chip shortages and things of that nature, they

12:55.840 --> 13:00.280
decided to release the game anyway because the Pokemon games are on a timetable and what

13:00.280 --> 13:01.280
have you.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.480
But I think a Pokemon style Breath of the Wild candidate would have been the perfect

13:05.480 --> 13:12.800
game to release a new type of like upgraded Switch and all that with, and I, and I think

13:12.800 --> 13:17.000
maybe some more of that potential and maybe some of the stutter and things like that probably

13:17.000 --> 13:18.760
would have been there on a Switch Pro.

13:18.760 --> 13:22.600
And so that's my hot take is that no, I don't think it was rushed, but I think they had

13:22.600 --> 13:27.240
to change it and suddenly as high as it was going to go was the Switch and there wasn't

13:27.240 --> 13:31.200
going to be a Switch Pro in that situation.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.160
Mike Deft in chat says, Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl was rushed.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.160
Legends RKS wasn't rushed.

13:38.160 --> 13:42.080
Mike Deft says, Game Freak has never been praised for their graphics.

13:42.080 --> 13:46.680
Fifth Dream in chat says, Nintendo consoles are one to five gens behind and Pokemon games

13:46.680 --> 13:48.880
are half more behind than that.

13:48.880 --> 13:52.280
I think that's a pretty good way to put it, summarize it there.

13:52.280 --> 13:56.760
D'Artezio says, Yes, I could see that as a big franchise, but like not a big game that

13:56.760 --> 14:00.640
does seem to track as launch title, right?

14:00.640 --> 14:03.200
Sometimes Nintendo kind of does this with their launch titles.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.880
I mean, it's not, you can't say they always do it, but like, look at the launch of the

14:06.880 --> 14:08.440
GameCube.

14:08.440 --> 14:14.840
Like Luigi's Mansion was kind of like their Mario game, but it wasn't really a Mario game

14:14.840 --> 14:16.280
at all.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.700
It was very different.

14:18.700 --> 14:22.940
And so, you know, I think and plus, we know that the Switch Pro, I think, would have been

14:22.940 --> 14:28.060
in mid-grade and anything that was designed for it should work on the Nintendo Switch.

14:28.060 --> 14:32.740
And I think that's why this game still came out at the end of the day is because it was

14:32.740 --> 14:36.820
designed to run on the Nintendo Switch, just like, you know, Breath of the Wild was designed

14:36.820 --> 14:39.220
to run on the Wii U and all that stuff.

14:39.220 --> 14:44.220
Zelda Twilight Princess was designed to run on the GameCube and the Nintendo Wii and all

14:44.220 --> 14:45.220
that stuff.

14:45.260 --> 14:50.300
I just think that it ended up at some point, we're not going to release it on a Switch

14:50.300 --> 14:51.580
Pro after all.

14:51.580 --> 14:56.940
I think if they do release a Switch Pro in the next year or so, I kind of don't think

14:56.940 --> 14:59.020
they will at this point.

14:59.020 --> 15:05.420
But if they do, and then suddenly this game works on it or there's a game of the year

15:05.420 --> 15:10.860
edition with the rumored DLC that comes out and all that stuff, I think it almost just

15:10.860 --> 15:16.180
guarantees I'm right in this situation.

15:16.180 --> 15:19.820
If it doesn't happen, I still kind of want to be right, but I may not be, and that's

15:19.820 --> 15:20.820
fine.

15:20.820 --> 15:21.820
I realize it's a hot take.

15:21.820 --> 15:27.820
S2100 Matt says, Game Freak still using the Game Boy era Pokemon growls is a troll for

15:27.820 --> 15:29.260
the haters at this point.

15:29.260 --> 15:34.180
Did you notice that even Pikachu and Eevee have the Game Boy growls?

15:34.180 --> 15:37.900
There's not even a Pikachu in every Pokemon game.

15:37.940 --> 15:45.380
Even on Pokemon Yellow, Pikachu went Pikachu and doesn't do it here.

15:45.380 --> 15:49.540
I think that's more to try to fit in with the lore.

15:49.540 --> 15:53.660
You can call it corner cutting, but I think you can say there's an argument to be made

15:53.660 --> 15:59.300
about the whole, it's historical, it's the first Pokedex, it's when Pokemon were still

15:59.300 --> 16:05.740
violent and all this stuff that maybe plays into that and why they can kind of do that.

16:06.580 --> 16:11.940
Anyway, LM Orchard in chat says, How'd Pikachu go again?

16:11.940 --> 16:12.940
Pikachu.

16:12.940 --> 16:13.940
Pikachu.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.940
Yeah, Jamie does it better.

16:16.940 --> 16:17.940
All right.

16:17.940 --> 16:22.060
Well, also, Pikachu's voice actor is a lady.

16:22.060 --> 16:25.220
Yes, Bulbasaur is a lady, too.

16:25.220 --> 16:26.380
She was at Dragon Con one year.

16:26.380 --> 16:28.560
I think several of them are ladies.

16:28.560 --> 16:33.840
Not all of them, though, of course, because I think the director of the first Pokemon

16:33.840 --> 16:36.680
movie or something does one of the voices of one of the Pokemon.

16:36.680 --> 16:37.680
So, anyway.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.680
All right.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.120
I just want to answer that.

16:40.120 --> 16:44.000
I thought it was an interesting question, and I wanted to put that hot take at the start

16:44.000 --> 16:45.600
of the show.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.880
Let's get to another hot take going around the gaming industry right now.

16:48.880 --> 16:53.880
Rumors, rumors, rumors, although this, I don't know if I would put this in the rumor department

16:53.880 --> 16:58.280
because it's more a little bit like there is smoke and potentially fire.

16:58.280 --> 17:03.520
It's something that Business Insider reported on, which has a little bit more of a reputation

17:03.520 --> 17:04.720
for getting things.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.320
Although it's interesting, their entire site is paywalled, or at least the story is.

17:08.320 --> 17:13.040
So a lot of people are having a report on the report.

17:13.040 --> 17:17.320
But many game blogs are pointing out that Business Insider has run a report that says

17:17.320 --> 17:22.480
Stadia has basically been demoted within Google.

17:22.480 --> 17:29.440
And I want to hear what Dark Soccer thinks of this, too, as Twitch's premier Stadia streamer.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.840
But I would need to see the report.

17:31.880 --> 17:36.240
Let me get to some of the information that is coming out of this first.

17:36.240 --> 17:41.480
Apparently, Phil Harrison, and why they're calling this a demotion, basically, Phil Harrison,

17:41.480 --> 17:49.240
who is the VP, I'm sorry, Phil Harrison now reports to Google's VP of Subscription Services

17:49.240 --> 17:53.520
instead of directly to Rick Osterlow, who is Google's hardware boss.

17:53.520 --> 17:58.440
And I think that movement is the catalyst for this whole story in this report.

17:58.440 --> 18:02.920
I think people are really running with this, and now you want to talk about hot takes.

18:02.920 --> 18:07.480
You're seeing the hot takes on Twitter where people are already eulogizing Stadia.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.800
I'm not sure it's quite that.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.160
In fact, I think we're quite a ways away from that.

18:12.160 --> 18:18.500
However, the report goes on to say, the reason for this is disappointing sales and performing

18:18.500 --> 18:21.080
far below Google's expectations.

18:21.080 --> 18:25.600
Google Stadia will now be focusing on lucrative deals with other companies to create and power

18:25.600 --> 18:27.540
experiences for them.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.860
Folks are talking about a deal with Peloton Bikes, which I think is very interesting,

18:31.860 --> 18:36.140
and it's going to be powered by Google Stream, which people are saying is just Google Stadia

18:36.140 --> 18:37.660
under a different name.

18:37.660 --> 18:41.240
It's the same technology.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.740
Very interesting.

18:42.740 --> 18:49.140
But I guess now only about 20% focus at Stadia is on the gaming side as was before, and this

18:49.140 --> 18:55.820
is according to an insider who gossiped to, appropriately, Business Insider.

18:55.820 --> 18:59.420
What's also interesting about this and what lends the Business Insider report to some

18:59.420 --> 19:03.860
credibility potentially is that Google Stadia kind of responded, but they responded with

19:03.860 --> 19:08.920
their tongue in their cheek with a tweet that said, if you hear one thing, hear this.

19:08.920 --> 19:13.940
The Stadia team is working really hard on a great future for Stadia and cloud gaming.

19:13.940 --> 19:17.780
We hope you agree, and we know the proof is in the playing.

19:17.780 --> 19:22.140
The source went on to talk to Business Insider saying, there are plenty of people internally

19:22.140 --> 19:26.140
who would love to keep it going, so they are working really hard to make sure it doesn't

19:26.140 --> 19:31.060
die, but they're not the ones writing the checks.

19:31.060 --> 19:32.060
It doesn't seem like-

19:32.060 --> 19:33.940
I'm reading the Business Insider article right now.

19:33.940 --> 19:34.940
Oh, fun.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.420
I'll get your take on that in just a moment.

19:36.420 --> 19:37.420
Let me get a couple-

19:37.420 --> 19:41.540
Yeah, for the record, if you ever want to get past a paywall, go to archive.js and put

19:41.540 --> 19:43.620
in the URL, and it should load it up.

19:43.620 --> 19:45.220
There you go.

19:45.220 --> 19:50.380
Apparently, Google will not probably pull the plug on Stadia anytime soon, but it's

19:50.380 --> 19:56.060
just kind of playing into the whole- Google didn't really play off as much as they wanted.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.940
So I don't think they're going to shut Stadia down tomorrow or anything like that, but here's

19:59.940 --> 20:00.940
what it is.

20:00.940 --> 20:06.160
And then I definitely want to let Jamie have a say here as our Stadia expert, I guess.

20:06.160 --> 20:11.100
What it is, is this is just playing right into the hands of a lot of people that when

20:11.100 --> 20:15.940
Stadia launched, they said, Google's going to treat this like they do everything else.

20:15.940 --> 20:20.160
They're going to give it two years to be successful, and if it doesn't, they're going to cut it

20:20.160 --> 20:23.400
off at the kneecaps, just like all these other things they launch.

20:23.400 --> 20:27.960
And so people are now reading this, and even though they're not really hearing- Google

20:27.960 --> 20:32.440
Stadia is not being shut down, it's just being deprioritized.

20:32.440 --> 20:38.080
Everybody's kind of going, well, we all knew that's what was going to happen.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.080
Here it is.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.720
That's not at all what I think this is saying.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.720
Go ahead.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.720
Just looking this over.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.200
What's your take on this?

20:45.240 --> 20:53.280
What I think is happening is that they're branching out the technology for Stadia.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.280
Stadia isn't going anywhere.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.280
They're still supporting it.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.280
They're still bringing stuff out.

20:56.280 --> 21:02.280
They just actually had a big sale for the Capcom licenses.

21:02.280 --> 21:07.460
I just got the deluxe Resident Evil Village for like 40 bucks.

21:07.460 --> 21:11.420
So they're still pushing on it.

21:11.420 --> 21:16.860
What I think it is is that they're licensing the technology to get more out of it.

21:16.860 --> 21:22.700
I mean, yeah, they've lost some money on it, but it still has a very dedicated user base.

21:22.700 --> 21:29.940
And again, for people like me who play on a Mac, for example, it's a better alternative

21:29.940 --> 21:34.960
in my book to using the NVIDIA service.

21:34.960 --> 21:40.020
I don't want to use the NVIDIA service, I mean, because it just hasn't worked out as

21:40.020 --> 21:44.040
well for me.

21:44.040 --> 21:52.520
That being said, I think that they're trying to confirm their own bias is what I think

21:52.520 --> 21:54.240
is happening.

21:54.240 --> 22:00.120
And so that's why the Stadia crew had to go in and do damage control, because if anyone

22:00.120 --> 22:05.480
is going to know if it's going to continue or how it's going to be supported, it's going

22:05.480 --> 22:10.060
to be the people that are behind it, right?

22:10.060 --> 22:14.180
And they say that there's some things coming out that they can't talk about, but it does

22:14.180 --> 22:19.060
make it seem like there's going to be new titles and maybe even new services.

22:19.060 --> 22:25.060
And they're already talking about UI improvements, like having ways to sort through your games

22:25.060 --> 22:27.220
and having a different type.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.140
They just added in the search feature.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.860
They've really been stepping up the interface for Stadia.

22:33.860 --> 22:45.280
Now I'm really reading this more, especially since Google tried to work with Bungie and

22:45.280 --> 22:48.120
we're even looking at acquiring them before Sony stepped in.

22:48.120 --> 22:53.080
We'll get to that.

22:53.080 --> 22:59.820
And on top of that, they also worked with AT&T to allow people to stream Batman Arkham

22:59.820 --> 23:05.240
Knight directly through the web browser.

23:05.240 --> 23:12.440
But Google's branding wasn't on it, but AT&T definitely said it's running on Stadia's technology.

23:12.440 --> 23:17.040
So I think that they're looking to branch out their streaming technology to other services

23:17.040 --> 23:24.120
like Peloton or maybe other developers to have their stuff out.

23:24.120 --> 23:32.120
They've even pitched using Stadia services as beta testing for PC games that are going

23:32.120 --> 23:35.380
to be coming in, PC, Mac games, whatever, that are going to be coming out.

23:35.380 --> 23:43.920
So that's what I'm reading into this, especially with bringing up the information about branching

23:43.920 --> 23:44.920
out like that.

23:44.920 --> 23:49.500
I really do think of it as a branching out.

23:49.500 --> 23:54.240
I think it wasn't a big priority because Google's always been like, if it's not an

23:54.240 --> 24:01.740
overnight success, then it's not a success and need to learn to play the longevity game.

24:01.740 --> 24:07.380
On top of that too, there's been plenty of companies that have just absolutely adopted

24:07.380 --> 24:12.140
the service and find it very useful.

24:12.140 --> 24:19.340
I don't want to be alarmist and I don't want to believe any kind of hype until I see a

24:19.340 --> 24:22.500
official word from the official people.

24:22.500 --> 24:26.340
I'll take all of this with a grain of salt, but what I'm translating this to is just that

24:26.340 --> 24:30.480
they're going to be expanding that technology and using it in different ways so the gaming

24:30.480 --> 24:34.460
platform may not seem like it's getting as much attention.

24:34.460 --> 24:38.740
I think it's going to be getting as much attention, but other aspects of it will be getting attention

24:38.740 --> 24:40.140
as well.

24:40.140 --> 24:43.820
I'm of two minds with this and I think a lot of what you say really does hit the nail on

24:43.820 --> 24:47.700
the head because I do think Google is certainly...

24:47.700 --> 24:53.380
Why limit the streaming technology to gaming when there's other spaces where it makes sense

24:53.380 --> 24:57.560
to grow this technology into such as like the Peloton thing is actually kind of interesting

24:57.560 --> 25:04.540
to me and whatever else might be in the future for mobile and these sorts of things, absolutely.

25:04.540 --> 25:10.000
I don't think we should be eulogizing Stadia by any means at this point and I think a lot

25:10.000 --> 25:16.500
of that is still very premature and I think there are very exciting uses like you talk

25:16.500 --> 25:22.560
about like the betas and being able to preview things without necessarily downloading something

25:22.560 --> 25:26.240
to your computer where pirates can get in there and data mine, or excuse me, hackers

25:26.240 --> 25:28.700
whatever can get in there and data mine things.

25:28.700 --> 25:31.840
That actually should be a very lucrative thing for companies to want to get into I would

25:31.840 --> 25:35.880
think.

25:35.880 --> 25:39.400
Go ahead with your quote because I do have a however with this because I do think there

25:39.400 --> 25:41.480
is something we have to realize, but go ahead.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.640
Patrick Sabled who is a Google spokesperson, I'm just going to read this verbatim.

25:45.640 --> 25:49.960
We announced our intention of helping publishers and partners deliver games directly to gamers

25:49.960 --> 25:52.480
last year and we have been working toward that.

25:52.480 --> 25:57.160
The first manifestation has been our partnership with AT&T who is offering Batman Arkham Knight

25:57.160 --> 25:59.440
available to their customers for free.

25:59.440 --> 26:04.280
While we won't be commenting on any rumors or speculation regarding other industry partners,

26:04.280 --> 26:08.440
we are still focused on bringing great games to Stadia in 2022.

26:08.440 --> 26:12.280
With 200 plus titles available, we expect to have another hundred plus games added to

26:12.280 --> 26:19.400
the platform this year and currently have 50 games available to claim in Stadia Pro.

26:19.400 --> 26:26.380
So getting into my however, I do think that Google is taking a focus off of gaming a little

26:26.380 --> 26:31.620
bit and what the original intent was behind Stadia and I think you know the reorganization

26:31.620 --> 26:33.160
makes that very clear.

26:33.200 --> 26:38.200
I think the fact that they kind of stopped, you know, they canceled the games that they

26:38.200 --> 26:42.280
were making, they sold off the, you know, whatever they were, they don't really have

26:42.280 --> 26:46.800
any exclusives in-house anymore and I really think they stopped signing the deals to get

26:46.800 --> 26:49.840
the exclusives outside as well.

26:49.840 --> 26:54.360
So I think this whole idea that like Google Stadia is a console that's going to compete

26:54.360 --> 26:59.880
with Xbox and Switch and the trick is it's not actually a console, it's just there in

26:59.880 --> 27:00.880
the cloud.

27:00.880 --> 27:07.360
I think that whole image that we've had in our minds, that ain't it anymore and that's

27:07.360 --> 27:08.360
what it is.

27:08.360 --> 27:14.760
And to be honest, in my opinion, that was all missed messaging from the very beginning.

27:14.760 --> 27:22.800
And quite honestly, I think the biggest problem in Stadia's pocket right now, I don't think

27:22.800 --> 27:25.400
Phil Harrison is a very good leader.

27:25.400 --> 27:30.880
I just don't think he's, I think he's misfired the messaging on this from the very beginning.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.200
I don't think he's very good for the company.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.320
It's like he has a history of doing this.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.320
Exactly.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.800
I think Phil Harrison is the problem.

27:38.800 --> 27:44.000
And what's going to be interesting, I will bet, I will bet money he leaves within the

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
next year.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
He's gone.

27:46.000 --> 27:52.320
And people are going to use that to further eulogize Stadia when in fact that would actually

27:52.320 --> 27:55.560
probably be the best possible thing that could happen to the platform in my opinion.

27:55.560 --> 28:00.800
Can you go join the Amico team?

28:00.800 --> 28:04.240
Not going there.

28:04.240 --> 28:10.160
But I, it's interesting because I think if you were to go back to when this was first

28:10.160 --> 28:15.200
announced, I was very apprehensive about cloud gaming, you know, and I was very much like,

28:15.200 --> 28:17.520
I don't think this is the right thing.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.400
There's too many bandwidth caps.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.960
There's too many, you know, restrictions.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.360
How is somebody going to play 4K 60 frames a second?

28:25.360 --> 28:27.400
And that was my, my frame of thought.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.000
I'll admit that.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.280
It honestly wasn't until on this program, Dark Soccer was saying, this is a way for

28:34.280 --> 28:40.840
me to play shit on my Mac that I started to go, huh?

28:40.840 --> 28:47.360
And then Cyberpunk 2077 comes out and the best experience for that game is on Google

28:47.360 --> 28:48.520
Stadia.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.200
And I started to go, huh?

28:51.200 --> 28:55.040
And now I'm hearing about these betas and doesn't it make sense to do that more for

28:55.040 --> 28:56.480
the cloud and so forth.

28:56.480 --> 29:00.060
And I'm really starting to go, interesting.

29:00.060 --> 29:06.440
So I think I've really warmed up to the idea of what this cloud and how it fits into gaming's

29:06.440 --> 29:07.440
future.

29:07.440 --> 29:13.080
And I do think cloud gaming to some extent is going to be in the future of games.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.600
And I've said this before on the show is I've kind of been making this transition in my

29:16.600 --> 29:23.500
own thinking is that as 5G gets more and more popular, as more and more people work

29:23.500 --> 29:29.720
from home and cable companies and so forth get challenged on their data bandwidth caps

29:29.720 --> 29:32.940
as we get more and more connected and so on and so on.

29:32.940 --> 29:36.480
And I'm talking about things that happen 10 years from now.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.640
I'm not talking about things that happen next year or the year after.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.220
I'm talking about the long game people.

29:41.220 --> 29:43.800
I'm talking about OLR in our 50s.

29:43.800 --> 29:44.800
Okay.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.280
Cloud gaming, I think there is.

29:47.280 --> 29:51.640
And that's why so many people are getting into it in very different ways.

29:51.640 --> 29:56.400
And now you have, and this ended up being, I think a bit of an issue for Google as well.

29:56.400 --> 30:01.040
Google gets into it, Amazon gets into it, Microsoft gets into it, Nvidia gets into it.

30:01.040 --> 30:05.960
I mean, there are a lot of cloud gaming solutions right now.

30:05.960 --> 30:11.560
And I think the person that's playing the game the best, in my opinion, not from a technological

30:11.560 --> 30:15.240
perspective, but from a marketing perspective is Microsoft.

30:15.240 --> 30:21.040
And the reason why I say that is because they're not trying to like make a big deal of it.

30:21.040 --> 30:26.520
They're making it an option and they're subtly, it's like they're putting it on a plate and

30:26.520 --> 30:29.280
they're subtly nudging it in front of somebody.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.320
Here, eat this.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.800
You already have this Microsoft game pass.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.200
Did you know you can play all of these games on the cloud?

30:36.200 --> 30:37.600
Just click here to start that.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.160
Here, eat this.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.640
Whereas I think the problem that Stadia was challenged with and the messaging I think

30:42.640 --> 30:46.920
they misfired on was the whole, you've got to fucking have this.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.560
Cloud gaming is the future.

30:48.560 --> 30:52.120
And Stadia, you can play it on a Chromecast and all that stuff, even though it's not going

30:52.120 --> 30:53.120
to launch that way.

30:53.120 --> 30:57.440
And it's not going to look that way for like six months into it and so forth.

30:57.440 --> 31:02.240
But I sort of think Microsoft is playing the long game on that.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.920
And I think that's going to be successful for them.

31:05.320 --> 31:09.600
And again, I'm not saying that Stadia is going to fail, but I think Stadia misfired.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.800
And I think it's Phil Harrison's fault.

31:13.800 --> 31:18.640
Well, I did sign up for Amazon's service.

31:18.640 --> 31:22.680
Luna is the beta for it.

31:22.680 --> 31:28.440
And I'm really looking to see how it compares, you know.

31:28.440 --> 31:35.520
So I'm still going to stay with Stadia as long as I can until I get my PC rebuilt and

31:35.520 --> 31:38.320
then can just play Dead by Daylight on Steam.

31:38.320 --> 31:45.200
Well, because I think that because my accounts linked all of my achievements and whatever

31:45.200 --> 31:49.400
and my hours will transfer over, I hope.

31:49.400 --> 31:55.240
But that's pretty much the thing I'm playing on Stadia that and I was playing Cyberpunk,

31:55.240 --> 31:59.440
but I'm going to play Resident Evil, although I have other ideas for things I'm going to

31:59.440 --> 32:00.440
play now.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.440
Yeah.

32:01.440 --> 32:08.400
But I mean, I don't think your crown as the premier Stadia streamer on Twitch is going

32:08.400 --> 32:13.520
to go anywhere anytime soon because I think Stadia is staying around for a little bit.

32:13.520 --> 32:18.160
But I just don't think we're going to see Stadia exclusives or, you know, I don't think

32:18.160 --> 32:22.040
we're going to see a narrative really pushed where like Stadia is this.

32:22.040 --> 32:25.480
I think it's just going to it's going to be there and it's a thing that exists and it's

32:25.480 --> 32:27.280
a thing that you can buy games on.

32:27.280 --> 32:33.840
And another way to do it, I think, is is kind of what what it is at this point.

32:33.840 --> 32:37.720
Interesting perspective from Fifth Dream in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network

32:37.720 --> 32:43.100
who says this stuff is this stuff now is like VR in the 90s.

32:43.100 --> 32:49.120
It didn't take off on the first go, but eventually will accept it and it will be taken for granted.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.120
Interesting.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.640
You know, the graphics and VR weren't all that in the beginning.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.920
And I think a lot of that had to catch up a bit to make it because now everybody thinks

32:58.920 --> 33:02.960
of 90s VR and they think of that movie, The Lawnmower Man, and you go back and you watch

33:02.960 --> 33:06.400
that movie now and it's like, fuck, this was ridiculous.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.240
But that's that's what VR kind of look like in the 90s.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.240
Right.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.960
For those of us that lived it.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.480
But now it's very different.

33:13.480 --> 33:17.080
So I haven't thought movie in an age.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.280
I think most people have it.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.440
All right.

33:20.440 --> 33:22.120
Anyway, let's go ahead and move on.

33:22.120 --> 33:24.640
We're going to talk about our gaming weeks.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.720
Let's talk about how is your gaming week?

33:27.720 --> 33:30.540
We'll move over to Dark Sakura and I'll start with you.

33:30.540 --> 33:33.040
How is your gaming week?

33:33.040 --> 33:34.040
Productive.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.040
Yeah.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.840
I played Mass Effect 2.

33:38.840 --> 33:39.840
Nice.

33:39.840 --> 33:44.800
On through Windows 11 ARM.

33:44.800 --> 33:49.400
And it it had like right at first it had some syncing issues.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.240
And then after that, it was fine.

33:51.240 --> 33:54.380
I even got my old save files to work.

33:54.380 --> 33:59.660
The thing is that the the first Mass Effect save files will not work.

33:59.660 --> 34:02.920
And you know, I imported like some of my old favorites.

34:02.920 --> 34:08.480
I'm probably going to start the game over and live stream it, I think.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.120
But I've I've I had fun with it.

34:11.120 --> 34:15.560
Now the only other things that I'm trying to do is that like the save file editor, it

34:15.560 --> 34:18.120
will not run in this version of Windows.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.040
So I have to find something else.

34:20.040 --> 34:26.440
But but so far, I mean, it's it's the game I love and remember, you know, had a good

34:26.440 --> 34:27.440
time with it.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.480
It looks good.

34:28.480 --> 34:33.840
There's already high res textures for it, like even more high res.

34:33.840 --> 34:38.400
So I'm I'm just enjoying I'm enjoying it, you know, I'm playing and of course, playing

34:38.400 --> 34:41.720
copious amounts of Dead by Daylight.

34:41.720 --> 34:46.720
I'm kind of like, it's something that like goes off in my brain that the moment I hit

34:46.720 --> 34:49.440
like silver ranks, I'm just sort of like, okay, I don't care anymore.

34:49.440 --> 34:53.900
I'm just gonna play, you know, meme around with people like.

34:53.900 --> 34:55.880
I don't know how this came about.

34:55.880 --> 35:02.920
But when I was playing last night, I was in like the the airy, the the crow ladies area.

35:02.920 --> 35:05.580
And it was his arena just standing there.

35:05.580 --> 35:06.580
And I was playing Freddy.

35:06.580 --> 35:10.540
And we just both nodded at each other and then went in different directions and ended

35:10.540 --> 35:18.060
up that like, there was another fuck, what's her name from Halloween, Laurie, Laurie.

35:18.060 --> 35:21.060
Yeah, there was a Laurie there and I was playing her normal.

35:21.060 --> 35:23.940
And then I guess she and the arena player were friends or something.

35:23.940 --> 35:28.700
But then we just sort of just played around and we, you know, farmed the generators a

35:28.700 --> 35:29.700
little bit.

35:29.700 --> 35:33.380
And I let Laurie out and then Serena showed me the hatch and I closed the hatch and then

35:33.380 --> 35:34.380
Serena left.

35:34.380 --> 35:37.620
So it was just like a funny little game.

35:37.620 --> 35:42.000
And then I had like a mid, you know, a mid game boop match.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.700
I've just been having fun because like people are are being, you know, salty and sweaty

35:46.700 --> 35:49.220
and just taking things too seriously.

35:49.220 --> 35:50.380
And last night I just gave a shit.

35:50.380 --> 35:55.900
I just wanted to play, you know, play around, let people know there's another person here.

35:55.900 --> 36:01.420
But I've started doing something in my postgame chat that actually has made my experience

36:01.420 --> 36:03.420
in the game a lot better.

36:03.460 --> 36:08.060
And that's just saying, hey, I had fun.

36:08.060 --> 36:10.300
Have a great evening.

36:10.300 --> 36:15.060
You know, even if someone was a shit, you know, you know, I might say, well, what was

36:15.060 --> 36:19.340
this like, like I had a Jane player last night, there's, you know, when you go into the basement

36:19.340 --> 36:25.380
and the stairs turn to the side, there's a corner there that if someone's not down, it

36:25.380 --> 36:30.380
will clip them into that corner and you can't pick them up until I basically worked until

36:30.380 --> 36:31.860
I picked her up and got her there.

36:32.300 --> 36:35.900
You know, that was the only comment I said was like, you know, other than that exploit

36:35.900 --> 36:38.060
by the Jane player, you know, I had fun.

36:38.060 --> 36:40.460
I mean, I didn't do, you know, don't win or anything.

36:40.460 --> 36:41.180
I was playing huntress.

36:41.180 --> 36:43.820
I'm not good at her, but I had a fun time.

36:43.820 --> 36:50.580
And I'll make sure that I want people to leave a game that they're playing with me having

36:50.580 --> 36:51.700
a good experience.

36:52.100 --> 36:56.540
I think a lot of people just say GGWP, but I think because you see that so often, it

36:56.540 --> 36:58.180
kind of loses its meaning.

36:58.700 --> 37:00.020
It's desensitized, right?

37:00.020 --> 37:00.380
Yeah.

37:00.420 --> 37:08.220
And so for me, I'm just like, you know, Hey, I had a good time, you know, good game.

37:08.220 --> 37:13.180
It was, you know, but the big thing is me just saying, have a good night.

37:14.420 --> 37:19.860
And it changes the entire conversation instead of a, Oh, you got shitted on or whatever.

37:19.860 --> 37:24.540
Like, it was like, I just flat out instead of, you know, someone started with that and

37:24.540 --> 37:25.940
they said, Oh, just were you having an off night?

37:25.940 --> 37:28.780
Like, yeah, I was just, you know, memeing around and like, Oh, okay, that's cool.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.460
You know, well, better luck next time.

37:30.460 --> 37:31.580
I was like, yeah, you have a good one.

37:33.100 --> 37:38.220
Made, I even found a person that I got on two different characters on two different

37:38.220 --> 37:38.740
matches.

37:38.940 --> 37:39.860
So I rated them.

37:41.220 --> 37:47.660
Now here's how many bits dark Sakura for you to start off that chat very nice and pleasant.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.220
And then at the end say, now go get shit on.

37:50.260 --> 37:50.740
Good night.

37:52.300 --> 37:56.300
How many bits to get you to tell someone to go fuck themselves?

37:56.780 --> 37:58.260
I do it for 2,500 bits.

37:58.500 --> 37:59.020
All right.

37:59.300 --> 37:59.820
Noted.

38:00.700 --> 38:01.180
Noted.

38:01.620 --> 38:02.100
I'll do it.

38:02.100 --> 38:02.300
I'll do it.

38:02.900 --> 38:03.940
You should put that as a channel.

38:03.940 --> 38:04.980
I guess that's not actual money.

38:04.980 --> 38:06.140
It was channel points reward.

38:06.260 --> 38:08.220
Like 50,000 points get shit on.

38:09.820 --> 38:11.540
No, I know, I know.

38:11.820 --> 38:14.020
What's it makes me think of losing colors.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.220
Uh, GG easy.

38:15.340 --> 38:21.740
What used to be like his big premier reward, like for him to say GG easy was like 50,000

38:21.740 --> 38:22.660
points or something.

38:22.660 --> 38:27.500
But, um, I think because the, the context of the game has changed a little bit, he reduced

38:27.540 --> 38:29.540
the number of points you needed for that, but yeah.

38:29.980 --> 38:35.900
Well, I spend all of my points on one thing and one thing only, and that's the, uh, rate

38:35.900 --> 38:37.660
my, uh, rate, my cosmetics.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.740
And I don't even know what it is.

38:40.740 --> 38:45.100
Cause you know, the only reason I have survivors anymore is to play dress up with them, but

38:45.980 --> 38:47.220
people like my outfits.

38:47.340 --> 38:48.940
I guess I have good fashion sense in game.

38:48.940 --> 38:49.380
Who knows?

38:49.700 --> 38:53.940
For me, I hardly ever redeemed channel points because I'm always saving for the biggest

38:53.980 --> 38:56.500
e-ticket item I'm saving for VIP.

38:56.940 --> 39:01.900
Uh, you know, or the, you get a sound command and introduction every time you come in here

39:01.900 --> 39:07.060
and that those types of high ticket rewards, VIP shout out and a sound command and Nick's

39:07.060 --> 39:07.420
channel.

39:08.140 --> 39:12.140
Um, I have VIP in droves, hydro.

39:13.500 --> 39:19.140
And I think I got it in Isaaco and then Elsie just gave it to me like early on.

39:19.140 --> 39:26.460
So, but I, but I mean, but if I, if I'm in somebody's channel that much, I want to be

39:27.500 --> 39:32.300
I want to be productive and help them out and promote them while I'm there, you know?

39:32.740 --> 39:39.900
So, um, I'm still though, I think I put play survivor as my high level redeem and mine.

39:41.540 --> 39:44.940
Although I might, I might play tonight.

39:45.700 --> 39:48.580
If I get people to play with me, I have to get people to play with me.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.660
I'm I might be on, we'll see.

39:51.460 --> 39:51.620
All right.

39:51.620 --> 39:55.420
Well, the other, the other stuff I played, of course, I played word scapes, um, played

39:55.820 --> 39:57.900
Star Trek pinball here at my house.

39:58.860 --> 40:02.780
Um, and I am getting things ready.

40:02.780 --> 40:08.020
If the, the, uh, tool that I'm using to play it on works, I'm probably going to start

40:08.020 --> 40:09.780
streaming a link to the past.

40:10.620 --> 40:12.980
Oh, fun for like a retro game night.

40:13.140 --> 40:17.980
Um, other than that, like I said, you know, Sam going to, Oh, and Fantasian, of course,

40:18.100 --> 40:22.340
which I actually beat a boss that had been giving me fits before and I beat it pretty

40:22.340 --> 40:22.780
readily.

40:22.780 --> 40:24.460
So it was, it was really cool.

40:24.980 --> 40:25.300
Nice.

40:26.140 --> 40:26.380
Yeah.

40:26.580 --> 40:28.540
All right, let's move on to Loki.

40:28.540 --> 40:29.580
How was your gaming week, Loki?

40:30.260 --> 40:34.460
Uh, I'm playing Minecraft and more, more power washing sim.

40:35.660 --> 40:36.300
Good times.

40:36.660 --> 40:42.460
Well, you've had a week, so comfort food games like those, comfort, comfort food games

40:42.460 --> 40:43.580
like those go a long way.

40:43.580 --> 40:44.020
I'm sure.

40:44.340 --> 40:47.060
Dude, someone should just bring you a pot of macaroni and cheese.

40:48.020 --> 40:48.780
That's not a game.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.380
It should be comfort.

40:50.540 --> 40:51.180
It is comfort.

40:51.660 --> 40:55.020
What's better than video games and eating a pot of macaroni and cheese by yourself?

40:55.900 --> 40:56.700
Mmm.

40:56.740 --> 40:57.180
Coffee.

40:57.180 --> 40:57.620
I don't know.

40:59.780 --> 41:00.300
I don't know.

41:01.460 --> 41:04.900
But yeah, I've just been working on, um, the Minecraft stuff.

41:04.980 --> 41:12.180
Um, I filmed a little bit of this week and then I started to edit it down, but yeah, new

41:12.180 --> 41:12.980
episode comes in.

41:14.220 --> 41:17.660
Speaking of, by the way, before I get to my gaming week, uh, since channel point rewards

41:17.660 --> 41:21.980
got brought up and mac and cheese, um, we do need to schedule orange lounge foodie-o.

41:22.100 --> 41:26.300
I, uh, I know it was, it was delayed for several months because of some things I'm going through.

41:26.780 --> 41:29.740
Um, actually I do have a small update in that department.

41:29.860 --> 41:35.580
Um, I had, um, uh, update, uh, check on what's called your A1C, which is basically like your

41:35.580 --> 41:37.900
average blood sugar over a two to three month period.

41:38.340 --> 41:43.620
And, uh, I dropped that number by over three points down to, uh, basically a level that

41:43.620 --> 41:45.260
would be considered more pre-diabetic.

41:45.260 --> 41:46.220
So that's pretty exciting.

41:46.580 --> 41:51.340
Uh, and my doctor actually said in the email to me, you are doing amazing, which is a nice

41:51.340 --> 41:52.460
thing to hear from your doctor.

41:52.460 --> 41:58.300
So, um, that was a very nice, I mean, it's, it's come with some work and, uh, I'm, I'm third.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.820
You maybe you've noticed my, a little bit, cause now I'm getting to the point where like I see

42:01.820 --> 42:06.660
it, some of my weight loss, but I've come down 30 pounds, uh, than where I was last summer.

42:06.660 --> 42:09.060
So, uh, it's been, it's been an adventure.

42:09.100 --> 42:09.660
Thank you.

42:09.820 --> 42:10.300
Thank you.

42:10.660 --> 42:14.060
Uh, it's more about, more about my health than my looks, but.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.820
If I can get you to do weight training with me, that'd be awesome.

42:17.340 --> 42:23.100
Well, the nice thing is the new place I'm moving to has like a clubhouse with a gym that we get

42:23.100 --> 42:23.940
access to.

42:23.940 --> 42:28.620
So, and that I feel better, a little better about that than going to a place like, you know, 24

42:28.620 --> 42:32.220
hour, you know, any of those big clubs, because, you know, right now with COVID still, that's a

42:32.220 --> 42:33.420
little more exclusive.

42:33.420 --> 42:37.780
So it's a higher chance I can get in there when it's just me or one other person.

42:37.940 --> 42:39.580
So, um, that'll be easy.

42:39.620 --> 42:41.540
I can, I can do more than just walk.

42:41.660 --> 42:45.780
And I think in my routine, cause Omicron's kind of kept me from the gym during this whole time.

42:46.180 --> 42:49.060
Um, otherwise I would have started working that into my routine.

42:49.340 --> 42:50.060
So, yeah.

42:51.380 --> 42:56.740
Uh, anyway, my gaming week and other things, uh, honestly, my gaming week this week looks almost

42:56.740 --> 42:58.020
exactly like last week.

42:58.060 --> 42:59.180
A lot of the same games.

42:59.180 --> 43:01.060
I'm still playing a diverse amount of stuff.

43:01.060 --> 43:03.140
I'm playing Final Fantasy 14 as I usually do.

43:03.380 --> 43:05.180
I'm also continuing Dead by Daylight.

43:05.180 --> 43:07.380
I had a bit of an opposite week than Dark Sakura.

43:07.380 --> 43:10.980
I was, oh, just, just solo queue is so draining.

43:10.980 --> 43:13.220
I rage quit on Monday or Tuesday night.

43:13.260 --> 43:15.780
Like I just, I was getting tunneled.

43:15.780 --> 43:17.380
I was getting left on the hook.

43:17.420 --> 43:20.700
I died on first hook, uh, more than once.

43:20.700 --> 43:22.940
Like it was just really irritating stuff.

43:23.300 --> 43:27.060
And, uh, I like even Alan heard me go like, fuck this game.

43:27.060 --> 43:28.820
Or I just was like really upset.

43:29.180 --> 43:36.220
Uh, but then of course, like a dummy, I went back to it yesterday and I was like, all right, maybe this isn't so bad.

43:36.540 --> 43:40.020
MMR finally put me in a lower bracket or something and it was a little more manageable.

43:40.020 --> 43:41.580
That sounds like an abusive relationship.

43:41.580 --> 43:43.940
Pretty much, pretty much, honestly.

43:44.340 --> 43:45.820
Um, so there was that as well.

43:46.100 --> 43:48.820
Uh, and then, uh, Pokemon Legends Arceus.

43:48.860 --> 43:57.540
I've, uh, got past the second area in that and the boss there, uh, which I know some of you will probably already beaten the game and you've gotten through much further than I have.

43:57.820 --> 44:07.140
But I think there's a lot of people like me who are playing it very slowly and exploring the areas and catching all the Pokemon and getting items and all that stuff.

44:07.140 --> 44:09.500
So, um, I'm still really enjoying that game.

44:09.500 --> 44:10.940
It's, uh, it's great.

44:10.940 --> 44:14.140
We talked about that a lot at the top of the show though, so I won't add a lot to that.

44:14.460 --> 44:16.700
Uh, still played some Taiko no Tatsujin.

44:16.700 --> 44:17.980
I bought my first song.

44:18.420 --> 44:24.900
I also did my first online match, which I lost, which was bullshit because the other guy didn't get a full combo.

44:24.900 --> 44:27.780
I did, but I had more OKs.

44:28.140 --> 44:31.380
Um, but I was able to calibrate my TV and it's a little better.

44:31.620 --> 44:34.260
Um, but I guess I'm still not hitting as exact.

44:34.260 --> 44:35.180
Whatever.

44:35.420 --> 44:37.060
Uh, the game is still kind of fun, I guess.

44:37.220 --> 44:40.340
Yeah, the, the song I bought was like old school.

44:40.340 --> 44:46.940
I think it was called Namcott Melody, uh, because it was old school Namco games, like all mishmashed together.

44:47.140 --> 44:53.500
It was like the Pac-Man interlude, then the Mappy interlude, then like, you know, it's just like a bunch of stuff, like all kind of mishmashed together.

44:53.500 --> 44:54.140
It was really cute.

44:54.300 --> 44:59.100
So, um, but yeah, all that stuff together was pretty much my gaming week.

44:59.580 --> 45:01.020
Played a little bit here and a little bit there.

45:01.700 --> 45:02.140
All right.

45:02.380 --> 45:04.980
Uh, let's move into some other gaming news.

45:04.980 --> 45:09.580
Uh, just a reminder though, there will be no live show or podcast in two weeks.

45:09.820 --> 45:22.180
Because next week is, uh, the last show in this house with the studio and I'm moving and then, uh, yeah, it's going to be going to be a fresh coat of paint when we get to episode 904, uh, in a few weeks.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.620
So, um, yeah, but we will be here next week.

45:24.820 --> 45:29.660
I realize next week is a big, silly football game that a lot of people pay attention to.

45:29.900 --> 45:36.620
Uh, usually there's a big important concert with that as well, but they decided to go a different route this year than a big diva.

45:36.780 --> 45:37.980
Well, I guess they have Mary J.

45:37.980 --> 45:38.380
Blige.

45:38.380 --> 45:39.140
That's kind of neat.

45:39.340 --> 45:49.060
But, um, I'm not, I'm not as excited as I was with say Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira.

45:49.300 --> 45:50.180
It's Gaga.

45:50.180 --> 45:56.660
It's not quite that, uh, it's a different concert this year and, and the little, uh, game they play around the concert.

45:57.020 --> 46:01.620
Um, but just, just to be clear, that doesn't deter us from doing our show.

46:01.620 --> 46:02.820
We will still be here next Sunday.

46:02.820 --> 46:05.180
Usually I think that we will report on the puppy bowl.

46:06.060 --> 46:07.140
Uh, yes.

46:07.460 --> 46:08.660
Is that still going on this year?

46:08.900 --> 46:10.860
I guess it must be still doing the puppy bowl.

46:10.940 --> 46:11.700
When wouldn't it be?

46:11.700 --> 46:12.180
I don't know.

46:12.620 --> 46:12.980
All right.

46:13.420 --> 46:17.780
So, yeah, and like D'Artez uses in chat, it's usually kind of over by then anyway.

46:17.820 --> 46:18.340
Yes.

46:18.500 --> 46:25.340
So, um, as 200 Matt says, I envision off camera, Rob is surrounded by boxes and a massive Tetris like pattern.

46:25.620 --> 46:27.340
Not quite yet.

46:27.380 --> 46:31.100
Uh, but maybe next week it'll be a little more like, I would imagine next week.

46:31.180 --> 46:34.060
It's not the studio is not like all this stuff on the wall is going to be down.

46:34.420 --> 46:36.300
Uh, it's going to look very different in here.

46:36.620 --> 46:40.900
Uh, so, uh, yeah, but, um, probably not right now.

46:41.260 --> 46:44.580
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf does point out that he will not be here next week.

46:44.620 --> 46:55.140
Uh, cause he has a small gathering of folks for, um, the, the little, uh, uh, concert and a side of game that happens next week.

46:55.300 --> 46:59.820
Uh, and speaking of food, that's the other big deal about those types of things.

47:00.020 --> 47:06.100
You, you go to see your friends, uh, and, uh, it's all about the potluck and teeny weenies.

47:06.540 --> 47:07.700
That's basically what it is.

47:07.700 --> 47:11.140
It's, uh, next week is a celebration of teeny weenies.

47:12.780 --> 47:13.260
All right.

47:13.940 --> 47:14.980
Glad they get their day.

47:16.940 --> 47:17.740
Let's move on.

47:17.780 --> 47:20.340
Uh, let's get to our big headline of the week.

47:20.380 --> 47:21.180
Uh, Loki.

47:22.260 --> 47:28.740
So Sony has decided to go ahead and purchase bungee for $3.6 billion.

47:29.140 --> 47:43.300
Um, now, unlike Activision, Blizzard, or any, like some of the other acquisitions have been happening recently, they are still going to be remaining an independent subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment.

47:43.780 --> 47:48.100
And also they're going to be publishing games on multi-platform.

47:48.460 --> 47:50.820
So not just PlayStation exclusives.

47:51.300 --> 47:52.940
Of course, you know, that can all change down the road.

47:53.380 --> 47:54.220
We'll have to wait and see.

47:54.220 --> 48:00.820
But for right now, they are committing to at least, um, publishing on other platforms.

48:01.460 --> 48:02.580
So that's good.

48:02.900 --> 48:09.420
Um, along with that, Sony has been spending, um, money to keep the devs from leaving.

48:09.420 --> 48:21.580
So they've spent $1.2 billion of that to, I guess, you know, keep the staff that are there, um, that are working on Destiny 2 from leaving.

48:22.060 --> 48:25.180
So, and that'll be paid out over several years.

48:26.660 --> 48:43.940
So that's very smart, uh, to make sure you pay to keep the talent and not just, you know, cause if you look at Microsoft and Activision and that whole thing, people have been abandoning ship at Activision left and right and Blizzard and all that because of, um, that, you know, dumb fuck who's leading the company right now.

48:44.140 --> 48:56.620
Uh, I'm not talking about Microsoft who has an intelligent, uh, man that's leading the company, but I'm talking about, uh, people abandoning ship at ABK because of the dumb fuck that's running things over there, uh, who, uh, shouldn't have a job anymore.

48:56.620 --> 48:57.620
But I digress.

48:57.820 --> 49:01.780
My point is it's very smart of Sony to really pay to keep the talent here.

49:02.060 --> 49:13.780
Uh, because, uh, yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't know if like Sony has this bad stigma or whatever, where people would be looking to run, but they might be looking to run because they, they fear like the corporate.

49:13.940 --> 49:17.060
You know what, whatever it is, or it doesn't match their vision or what have you.

49:17.140 --> 49:18.340
Yeah, I suppose.

49:18.340 --> 49:21.780
I mean, it's still good to keep your talent around.

49:21.820 --> 49:26.580
And right now what they have planned is more live service games.

49:27.740 --> 49:29.380
I mean, that's what destiny is, I guess.

49:29.380 --> 49:29.900
So.

49:31.020 --> 49:33.420
Well, and it makes sense for Sony to have something like that.

49:33.460 --> 49:36.540
God, a war isn't that horizon isn't that.

49:36.660 --> 49:39.900
So it, it makes sense for them to have something in their pocket.

49:40.060 --> 49:41.140
You know what I think happened?

49:42.140 --> 49:47.260
Um, because a lot of folks are saying this is a response to Microsoft buying Activision.

49:47.300 --> 49:49.420
No, no.

49:49.420 --> 50:05.900
First off, if you're, if you're, um, if you're a gaming analyst or gaming commentator has come to that conclusion, that ought to be one of those red flag emojis because real talk, um, this conversation had to be in talks a long time ago.

50:05.940 --> 50:09.580
So this started well before the news that Microsoft.

50:10.220 --> 50:16.940
Now, you don't know who talks to who and maybe Sony picks some stuff, but I highly doubt any of that came into play.

50:16.980 --> 50:18.900
This was something that happened independent of that.

50:19.220 --> 50:23.740
It is simply interesting that Bungie was a Microsoft company.

50:24.020 --> 50:24.860
Then they weren't.

50:25.180 --> 50:26.980
Then they were an Activision company.

50:27.220 --> 50:28.100
Then they weren't.

50:28.100 --> 50:32.980
And they after the Activision thing, they were like, we're never getting into another relationship.

50:32.980 --> 50:37.820
And, you know, if Bobby Kotick was your CEO, fuck, I'd be pretty scarred, too.

50:38.140 --> 50:41.020
But now here we are, they're getting into a relationship again with Sony.

50:41.220 --> 50:42.620
That is interesting.

50:42.660 --> 50:48.140
Their trajectory, but, um, and it certainly has nothing to do with the Mike Microsoft Activision thing.

50:48.620 --> 50:52.060
Yeah, these are, these are Ms says it's had to be in the works for at least six months.

50:52.660 --> 50:53.220
Exactly.

50:53.220 --> 50:53.620
Exactly.

50:53.860 --> 50:57.900
And it's possible too, that it still could have been somewhat in response with that.

50:57.900 --> 51:01.580
Cause you know, you don't know who was talking to Activision to purchase them.

51:01.820 --> 51:06.380
Maybe Sony and Microsoft knew that, you know, one had interest for the others or something like that.

51:06.620 --> 51:13.100
So it could be possible that, you know, some of that cause sparked it, but no, it's not like, you know,

51:13.100 --> 51:18.460
Microsoft purchased Activision and they're like, well, we got to go buy somebody let's buy a bungee.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.300
Thankfully they didn't say Konami.

51:20.940 --> 51:21.980
That's not worth the money.

51:22.300 --> 51:26.340
Um, they would have gotten it significantly cheaper.

51:27.260 --> 51:28.420
I'll take $1.

51:28.740 --> 51:32.620
At least get the Silent Hill IP from the 99 cent store.

51:32.620 --> 51:33.300
Jesus.

51:33.340 --> 51:34.220
Oh gosh.

51:34.260 --> 51:38.380
Off offer the offer to buy an NFT of the Silent Hill franchise with Konami.

51:38.380 --> 51:39.340
Maybe they'll fall for it.

51:39.780 --> 51:41.980
Um, actually, wait quickly though.

51:41.980 --> 51:56.540
The, the one thing with, um, uh, bungee and Activision and all that, I think, uh, well, with PlayStation and why they bought bungee, I think, you know, because PlayStation does get to see things that bungee's working on before anyone else does.

51:56.740 --> 51:57.460
And they get to see this.

51:57.660 --> 52:11.860
I mean, there's confidentiality agreements, there's, you know, all sorts of things, but how do you think that like, okay, Sony secured the rights for an exclusive map to destiny when it first came out or destiny to, I don't remember which one of those, I got the exclusive map for.

52:11.860 --> 52:20.260
They had that whole thing, you know, so they they've had a relationship with bungee for a bit and they get to see these games months in advance to plan that marketing thing.

52:20.260 --> 52:21.340
And, oh, we're going to invest these dollars.

52:21.580 --> 52:29.860
So my thought is Sony saw something, whatever's bungee's working on now, and they were like, we have to have this.

52:30.300 --> 52:43.820
We don't want anyone else having this, but us, um, or this is something that makes sense with our Sony and PC platform, as I'll tell you, it's going to be PC as well, but it'll be a Sony and PC type of title.

52:44.020 --> 52:45.740
Uh, it makes sense with their strategy.

52:45.980 --> 52:48.780
So I think that is why Sony bought bungee.

52:49.780 --> 52:54.180
Oh, you want to, you want to know another red flag for your, uh, video game commentators?

52:54.180 --> 52:56.060
I'm just going to tell it like it is an analyst.

52:56.460 --> 53:08.260
If the next question that they're debating on their articles, their podcast or whatever is who's Nintendo going to buy red flag, emoji, red flag, emoji, not flag emoji.

53:08.260 --> 53:09.660
I haven't heard of that studio.

53:11.380 --> 53:13.180
Did we should totally start that studio?

53:13.500 --> 53:14.580
It's right.

53:14.980 --> 53:15.380
Right.

53:15.700 --> 53:20.260
Uh, Nintendo, Nintendo is not rule number one.

53:20.260 --> 53:27.900
And a thing you should come to realize a long time ago, Nintendo doesn't play the same game as the others in the room.

53:28.980 --> 53:42.420
And also, why would Nintendo need to buy a studio to make more exclusive games when nobody is making exclusive games as good as Nintendo?

53:42.940 --> 53:46.420
Some people are going to take issue with what I just said, but I fucking said it.

53:47.260 --> 53:49.620
Nintendo is making the exclusives.

53:49.980 --> 53:54.380
That's why everybody always goes, where, where, why won't Sony buy Nintendo?

53:54.380 --> 53:57.740
Where, where, why can't we have Pokemon legends on PlayStation five?

53:57.740 --> 54:04.820
Where, where, because, because Nintendo is making the games y'all want to play.

54:05.180 --> 54:08.900
And that's the, it's that, that's the fact they don't need to buy a studio to make games.

54:08.900 --> 54:10.580
They've got studios to make games.

54:10.820 --> 54:16.380
They're only going to buy the things that make sense with their French vanilla fantasies.

54:16.820 --> 54:18.580
That's, that's, that's it.

54:18.820 --> 54:25.820
They're only going to buy the studios that are already marching in tandem with them and already kind of pretty much a part of the family and so forth.

54:25.980 --> 54:28.540
They're not, Nintendo ain't fucking buying Sega.

54:29.180 --> 54:30.660
They're not going to buy Konami.

54:30.660 --> 54:34.580
They're not, Nintendo is just going to keep making Nintendo games.

54:35.580 --> 54:36.980
So that's it.

54:36.980 --> 54:41.780
Yeah, orange right in chat says Nintendo does what Nintendo does.

54:42.420 --> 54:43.820
Yes, that.

54:45.660 --> 54:51.260
Tiger Claw says Nintendo owns a couple studios of their own that develop only on their platform.

54:51.420 --> 54:54.540
Tiger Claw points out Retro Studios, the Pokemon company to name a few.

54:54.660 --> 55:01.540
Yes, companies that worked with them for a while on titles and were already kind of making games for Nintendo.

55:01.540 --> 55:10.340
And it just made sense to be in, Hal Laboratories is another, there you go, that just makes sense to be in lockstep with them and where those acquisitions make sense.

55:10.540 --> 55:15.700
Nintendo fucking coming out of left field and plunking down a bunch of cash for Sega, not Nintendo's game.

55:15.700 --> 55:23.620
So I'm just, I'm just saying I would be, I mean, fuck, it's 2022 and we've all lived in this pandemic era.

55:24.020 --> 55:26.020
Nothing should surprise us anymore.

55:26.020 --> 55:32.180
So you know what, if I have to sit here and eat crow because Nintendo does end up buying someone big, then you know what?

55:32.180 --> 55:39.740
Fuck it. Get me some ketchup because, uh, it would be certainly interesting, but I just, I think that's all it is, is a fan wank fantasy.

55:39.740 --> 55:43.540
I don't think it's rooted in reality, but what is real anymore?

55:44.660 --> 55:46.260
What is real anymore?

55:48.060 --> 55:51.780
Anyway, uh, Loki, anything else you want to say with that story?

55:51.980 --> 55:53.380
No, that's it really.

55:54.340 --> 55:56.380
What do you think about the whole thing, Loki?

55:56.380 --> 55:58.660
Do you think this is a good route for Sony?

55:59.500 --> 55:59.940
Sure.

55:59.940 --> 56:00.460
Why not?

56:00.460 --> 56:06.260
Cause I'm not a big fan of Destiny, so I don't really care, but cool.

56:06.340 --> 56:09.140
I mean, I'd be curious to see what they develop next.

56:09.140 --> 56:10.300
Probably Destiny 3.

56:10.980 --> 56:12.340
That's how it works nowadays.

56:13.060 --> 56:16.580
I like Destiny on paper more than I do actually playing it.

56:16.580 --> 56:19.220
And that is simply because I'm not great at shooters.

56:19.220 --> 56:20.260
That's, that's really it.

56:20.260 --> 56:21.300
That's the end all be all.

56:21.300 --> 56:23.460
But I, I like what it is otherwise.

56:23.460 --> 56:27.180
And I've spent time, I actually, that was a game I played on Stadia for a

56:27.180 --> 56:30.300
bit when I was kind of evaluating and I actually, cause I was like, Oh, I

56:30.300 --> 56:33.700
get to play on my PC as opposed to trying to play it on, you know, Xbox

56:33.700 --> 56:36.500
or something with a controller and get to use my mouse and keyboard.

56:36.500 --> 56:40.460
And it actually, it actually, I enjoyed playing it on, uh, that system.

56:40.460 --> 56:42.340
So, uh, yeah, there is that.

56:42.780 --> 56:44.100
So, all right.

56:44.380 --> 56:49.460
Um, let's move on to another story about Sony and about the PlayStation

56:49.500 --> 56:53.820
five and, uh, how they're not selling quite as many of them as they thought

56:53.820 --> 56:55.300
they would, but it's not their fault.

56:56.020 --> 56:57.140
It's the chip shortage.

56:57.220 --> 56:58.380
It's the chip shortage.

56:58.540 --> 57:03.700
It's, you know, it's that thing that's been blamed for everything.

57:04.180 --> 57:08.260
Um, eh, Sony did the quarterly financial earnings report as these

57:08.260 --> 57:09.540
large companies tend to do.

57:09.540 --> 57:12.580
And they did point out there was a rise in profit in the gaming decision

57:12.940 --> 57:17.740
division, excuse me, but Sony did lower the full year PlayStation five

57:17.740 --> 57:22.980
sales forecast from 14.8 million to 11.5 million.

57:22.980 --> 57:24.380
That is a fiscal year forecast.

57:24.380 --> 57:26.060
So that means it ends on March 31st.

57:26.060 --> 57:27.380
That's the year they're talking about.

57:27.700 --> 57:32.020
Um, now of course, according to the chief financial officer at Sony, uh,

57:32.020 --> 57:37.380
Hiroke Totoke, uh, the, uh, we can't say exactly for sure what

57:37.380 --> 57:38.900
the demand is for next year.

57:39.220 --> 57:44.860
Um, sorry, that's not part of the quote, but basically that, um, no, that

57:44.860 --> 57:47.140
what I read is, sorry, I thought this next part was, I was about to read,

57:47.140 --> 57:51.620
but, uh, in, in short, basically, uh, chip production and all that is,

57:51.620 --> 57:55.180
has been affected by the ongoing chip shortages around the world.

57:55.180 --> 57:59.820
So, uh, yeah, uh, Sony's trying to get more PlayStation fives, but these

57:59.820 --> 58:02.500
chip shortages are going to continue for the time being, which again, if

58:02.500 --> 58:06.460
you're paying to paying attention to anything in electronics, cars, the

58:06.460 --> 58:10.940
refrigerator, Alan and I are trying to buy, uh, any of this stuff, it's,

58:10.980 --> 58:12.500
it all plays in any of this.

58:12.580 --> 58:16.780
Um, Intel has actually said the semiconductor shortages

58:16.780 --> 58:18.500
can continue into 2023.

58:19.820 --> 58:25.380
Um, Nintendo has also slashed a switch production and said a 20% decrease

58:25.380 --> 58:30.460
in availability as has X-Box talked about this, uh, basically saying,

58:30.460 --> 58:33.460
um, interesting though, when Phil Spencer talked about it, he said,

58:33.580 --> 58:37.260
I think it's probably too isolated to talk about it as just a chip problem.

58:37.460 --> 58:40.380
When I think about what does it mean to get the parts necessary to build a

58:40.380 --> 58:44.220
console today and then get it to the markets where the demand is, there are

58:44.220 --> 58:47.140
multiple kinds of pinch points in that process.

58:47.300 --> 58:48.100
So it's interesting.

58:48.100 --> 58:49.060
He's kind of called out.

58:49.060 --> 58:50.780
There's other interesting things.

58:50.980 --> 58:54.700
It's trying to get that boat through the Panama canal.

58:54.700 --> 58:57.860
And then there's one boat that's making them all back up that causes

58:57.860 --> 59:00.740
these consoles to, uh, not happen on time.

59:00.740 --> 59:02.180
It's basically what it's coming down to.

59:02.260 --> 59:04.300
So, yep.

59:04.980 --> 59:10.220
Anyway, um, not terribly surprising to hear, but it is interesting when

59:10.220 --> 59:14.300
you hear it resulted in the, uh, or you hear it reported in the company's

59:14.300 --> 59:18.180
financial statements, basically it's, uh, yeah, I still don't have a PlayStation

59:18.180 --> 59:21.940
five, but I'm hoping, I'm hoping, um, after this move settles down and now

59:21.940 --> 59:24.900
you all know why I didn't indulge in the holidays, cause I've been saving

59:24.900 --> 59:28.620
for this house stuff, but, um, after that all settles down, I'm hoping I will

59:28.620 --> 59:32.540
finally get the PlayStation five, maybe over the summer, uh, if the finances

59:32.540 --> 59:36.420
still look good, cause, uh, I don't want to miss Final Fantasy 16 if it comes

59:36.420 --> 59:37.780
out this year, that's for sure.

59:38.260 --> 59:38.980
So we'll see.

59:40.260 --> 59:42.420
All right, moving on Dark Sakura.

59:42.860 --> 59:45.620
Why, why talk about new consoles when we can talk about old ones?

59:46.780 --> 59:48.140
Thanks for the spoiler, Rob.

59:48.140 --> 59:48.700
Sorry.

59:48.700 --> 59:50.380
It's on the sidebar for what it's worth.

59:51.100 --> 59:53.740
Yeah, but I have my own intro set up for that.

59:53.980 --> 59:54.580
Oh, my bad.

59:54.660 --> 01:00:00.140
Anyway, um, I was going to say there's a new game coming on an old thing.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:08.300
So, uh, well, the game is coming out on the Wii U in the eShop and it's going

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:13.940
to use the balance board, or at least it can use the balance board, but it is a,

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:20.620
um, a game called Silver Falls, white inside it's Umbra, it's a horror

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.780
game, uh, done by Sun Grand Studios.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:28.820
Um, it will allow you to use the balance board for, uh, you know,

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.740
for movement if you want to.

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.140
Um, it looks pretty cool.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:38.020
I mean, this is sort of what I always thought the Wii U would have been great

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:44.140
for, you know, I always wished that, um, that there'd been other games that had

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:49.580
such deep integration with, uh, with the, the game pad, you know, so that you

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:53.460
could see more stuff on there or use it to solve your puzzles or make it a

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.900
camera or something.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.980
Um, but it looks pretty cool.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:02.300
I mean, I don't know if it's worth me busting out wherever I put my Wii U to

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.300
play, but Hey, it could be fun.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.220
And I like, I like kind of scary games.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:11.300
So, yeah, I think that's a good question.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.340
You bring up those, how many people still have their Wii U hooked up?

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.380
Cause I don't, I don't even have a Wii U anymore.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:17.900
Yeah, I know.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.060
I think a lot of people, I mean, I'm sure there's some, like if I pulled

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.340
the chat, there'd be a couple of people that are like, Oh, I still have it.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:22.780
I still have it.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.860
I mean, how many of you actually still have a hooked up to your TV, ready

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.340
to power on in a moment's notice?

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.740
Cause I still have my Wii U it's just in a box.

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:35.060
Ours was actually until like mid last year when we loaned it to Julian.

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:35.660
Hmm.

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.740
So, okay.

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.620
There's a couple of people, it's about half and half.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:43.940
Some say I do some say I have it, but it's not hooked up or mine's in store.

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.540
We busted out from time to time for certain games.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:49.660
Like Dan and I had talked about trying to dig it out to play Shantae.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.340
So, okay.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:53.780
Yeah.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:57.300
And especially I think anybody with a passing retro interest, I mean, a, the

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:01.700
virtual console is more expansive on the Wii U there's that and be, you know, just

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.860
people that are retro console console enthusiasts are going to tend to have

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:08.540
more systems set up readily accessible when they get the urge to play something

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:12.260
retro, which, you know, the Wii U kind of fits in that category now as a retro

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.340
console, they, I know it's weird to think about, but it kind of is at this point.

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.940
Um, when did the Wii U release?

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:18.940
Was it 20?

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.700
Was it 2012?

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.620
Are we hitting the 10 year point?

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.380
No, no, no.

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.580
Cause it was, it was after I started my new job.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:30.060
So that would have been after 2014 and he was like 2015 or something.

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:31.180
Was it really that?

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:31.500
I guess.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:31.900
Oh, wow.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.540
Maybe it was Bob Coffees is 2013 was the year.

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:36.020
2013.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.540
Oh, I might've gotten a little bit late.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:38.140
Yeah.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:39.460
All right.

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:40.420
Anyway.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.100
Uh, let's move on Loki.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:47.180
So speaking of Nintendo consoles and, you know, sales and stuff, you know, the

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:53.700
switch it's doing well, it's outsold the Nintendo Wii something that, you know, we

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.940
thought that might not actually be possible, but yes, apparently it is quite

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.780
possible to do that.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:00.700
So, um, not bad.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:06.860
Uh, I'm curious to see a word ends up leaving off at the end.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:10.820
I mean, cause I mean, if it's already outsold the Wii and it's only been out a

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:19.260
few years, um, it's going to be interesting to see, but, um, yeah, 103

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:25.020
million or 103.5 million units sold since the end of the year.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.300
So pretty good.

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:28.740
Yeah, not bad.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.220
I'm curious, we'll probably get an updated number to that around March.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:33.780
I'm guessing.

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.740
Cause that's usually the end of the financial year.

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:40.780
So we'll have to wait and see, you know, a good point that, um, Jason, our, our

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:45.540
voiceover guy brought up is that, um, part of the reason probably why you see

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.380
this number is as high as it is.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:50.460
I mean, it's, it's a great console and you know, there's good games on it.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.580
And of course all that's very important and we shouldn't neglect any of that.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:04:00.060
But, um, when the Wii was out, you also still had the Nintendo DS and the 3DS

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.980
that was capturing that part of the handheld market and Nintendo has

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.740
essentially consolidated their two markets.

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:11.420
So the Wii does not exist separately as the DS and 3DS as a platform.

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:15.100
Nintendo has gone from two platforms to one platform that does both.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.180
And so that's also a big part of this as well is that that number really

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:22.300
reflects handheld and, you know, uh, console.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:23.820
I'm surprised.

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:29.380
So like the top selling game is Mario Kart eight deluxe, which is that 43.35

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:33.860
million units, but like you would think like Mario Odyssey would be up there.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.700
It's only 23 million.

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:40.700
And then even like say, you know, breath of the wild is 25 million.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.220
So I'm kind of surprised that those are so low.

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:47.140
I am as well, but it's very, it's very, that's a Wii U game.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.940
Uh, well, I, I think that's actually not a factor anymore

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.140
that it was a Wii U game.

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.180
I think that, you know, nobody bought the Wii U.

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.900
I know I'm making a broad stroke there.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:58.380
Sorry.

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.380
Especially to everybody in chat that just said, my Wii U is still hooked up.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.060
I think the reality is nobody bought the Wii U.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:09.700
Uh, and so, um, you know, when we talk about these big numbers and so I think

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:12.740
that part isn't as much, and I think what it is, it's just, it's just that thing

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:17.580
that Mario Kart is that easy multiplayer party game that people want to own so

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:21.660
that they have like the party game for people to play or people come over and

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.740
there's game night and I think Mario Kart is just like that thing that's in

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:28.820
our culture that so many people know now, you know, that it's just, I think that's

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:33.460
why it even outsells a brilliant title like breath of the wild where I don't

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.700
think there's as many people that are, cause you know, if you want to play

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:39.300
breath of the wild, you're going to have to sit down and game, you're going to,

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.460
you know, spend some time with breath of the wild and not everybody approaches

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.820
their video games like that where they're playing for hours and hours at a time.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:49.300
Some people just want to be able to play Mario Kart, uh, before or after

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.500
the game that's on television.

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.780
I think that's a big part of it.

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:57.740
Uh, what it is, um, Bob coffee and chat says Mario Kart, deluxe is evergreen.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:00.100
Tons of normies buy it every day.

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:00.780
Exactly.

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.820
It's normies muggles, I guess.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:08.820
Although I don't, I don't love using words in her environment, but, um, muggle,

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:14.380
muggles always a way I've explained non-gamers, um, dark Tetsuya said, I mean,

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.660
I thought that we, you was all right, but consider I have like a dozen Wii U games

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:18.860
compared to over two dozen on switch.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:23.740
Yeah, me, me saying no one bought the Wii U does not suddenly make it a bad console

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:25.060
or all the games on it were bad.

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:26.140
I owned a Wii U.

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:26.940
I thought it was great.

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:30.580
And there was a lot of games on it I really liked and I think EA really fucked

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.700
them, but that's, that's a whole other story.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:36.140
I think Nintendo did do some misfires with the Wii U and the number one

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.580
misfire was the name.

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.180
Um, but that's old news at this point.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.780
Uh, the reality is, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's passed away.

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:48.700
Uh, and now the switch is the new person in town and that's, uh, that's

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.260
what it is.

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.780
So, uh, E3VL says casuals.

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:53.940
Yes, there is that as well.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:58.940
Uh, moving on, uh, you know, what casuals love is Pokemon.

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:01.260
And this is some very welcome news.

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:06.100
I think for a lot of people, um, especially after, remember last week we

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:10.300
had that news story about there was a YouTube channel with all this Nintendo

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.980
music that got shut down.

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:16.060
And, you know, I think our response to that was, boy, it would be great if

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:19.460
Nintendo would have like a fucking player of their own somewhere where you

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:23.660
could play the music and sure folks pointed out, oh, they're super smash

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.900
brothers, but even that is, you know, that's embedded within another game.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.980
And it's not something that really, you know, it's not like a library online

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.420
you can access and all this stuff.

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.100
Well, this makes the news this week.

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:42.220
Very interesting that Pokemon diamond and Pokemon Pearl audio are now available

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.900
for use in personal projects.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:49.420
That is way off the course of what we would expect for Nintendo, right?

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:53.140
Now, granted, this is the Pokemon company and it's technically separate, but

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:55.420
obviously there's a relationship there, right?

01:07:55.740 --> 01:08:00.500
So the Pokemon company launched the DP sound library.

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.260
DP stands for diamond Pearl.

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.180
I just want to make that very clear about Pokemon diamond Pearl.

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:09.700
You can use audio from, uh, Pokemon diamond and Pokemon

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.620
Pearl in your personal projects.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:16.820
You can put sound effects in there in like a social media video, like a YouTube

01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:21.580
or Twitch, you could, if, if Bobby Black Wolf wanted to take out his overclocked

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:26.260
music breaks and use Pokemon DP library, he could, I don't think he will.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:31.140
Cause we still love overclocked here, but that is something that could be available

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.740
here on Twitch and what have you.

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.940
Um, also background music is allowed for non-commercial

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.580
event or personal websites.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:42.580
So in other words, you can't exactly like put it in a movie and sell the movie.

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:46.900
I imagine though, you could probably play it at a convention and get away with it,

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:49.460
even though that's kind of more of a gray area, but I digress.

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:52.460
You can also download the music to use.

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:56.700
Uh, you can stream the music if you just want some online radio type of stuff.

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:57.900
It's all there.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:05.180
Um, now, uh, there are of course bands on commercial uses, so no remix album to

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.820
sell, you can't put them in your own game.

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:10.900
No broadcast TV or radio or any of that.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.860
You cannot use the media.

01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:13.900
I think this is interesting.

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:19.060
You cannot use the media and anything that makes specific, ideological,

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:22.540
religious, or political claims.

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:23.580
Sorry.

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:27.140
I'm laughing because I thought of something a streamer did last night and I'm

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:31.140
going to, I'm going to warn Alan's in the kitchen, laughing too.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:35.900
Sorry.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.020
I can't no COVID Mon.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:41.380
No, Alan in the other room went, you know who also caught them all?

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:42.460
Jesus.

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.940
But here's the thing.

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:46.700
Okay.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:50.220
So there was, so you would not, you would not be able to use this in your stream.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.980
So it was actually, it was actually losing color.

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:56.740
Was I, I'm just going to, I'm going to warn, I'm going to warn this could ruffle

01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:01.180
some feathers, but I, I think if you just look at his humor and don't read too much

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:03.100
into it, it's actually kind of funny.

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.900
Was doing one of those postgame chats with people and was just like, you know,

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:10.740
typing or like I remember he was doing this whole thing as a, and then at the

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:17.220
very, very end just put, Oh, and by the way, enter, God doesn't exist left.

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:22.700
And I don't know why, but like Alan and I thought that was like the funniest troll.

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.420
Like we were watching on the TV in our bedroom.

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:27.180
We just start dying laughing.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.620
Oh, the player's name was God's warrior.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.100
I didn't even.

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.780
Oh, that was it.

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:34.900
I didn't even see that.

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:37.660
Oh, I just thought he randomly pulled that out of thin air.

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:39.580
Just wanted to let you know, God doesn't exist.

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:40.140
Good night.

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.900
And I just started laughing.

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:48.460
The other one that cracked me up, that was like, like something AR 14 or whatever.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.620
And then I made some sort of comment about that too.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.980
And I, I forgot anyway.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:11:00.340
So anyway, my point is probably would not want to use Pokemon DP music during that.

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:07.780
So if you're trying to make a, a religious or what have you a type of thing, a lot of

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:12.820
people noticing this comes right off the heels, off the youth, after the YouTube

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:16.180
channel gets shut down, of course, this isn't Nintendo that did this.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.300
It's the Pokemon company, but still hard to ignore.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:24.340
And I think a lot of people are looking at this going, please, Pokemon company, please,

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:31.140
please, will you go talk to your daddy Nintendo and tell him what a good idea this

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:34.100
is and how Nintendo should do this?

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:39.460
I mean, how many of you are just sitting here foaming at the mouth, salivating that

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:40.660
Nintendo do this?

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:41.860
I know I am.

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:50.060
Can you, can you fucking imagine if Nintendo actually said, actually said, you can use

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.980
our music and your streams royalty free.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:52.500
Enjoy.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.740
You would never hear it already treated like they do that anyway.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:00.420
So I don't understand what the difference would be, but it's a gray area now.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:05.860
I guess so, but people already use it carte blanche, so why not?

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.340
It would just be, I just be phenomenal.

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:13.340
Anyway, I hope this isn't the last, I have a feeling this might be a test of sorts.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.100
We'll see how that all plays out.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:20.100
But, um, I'm, I'm really hoping it's not the last that we see of this sort of thing.

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:24.460
Maybe we'll see more Pokemon music make its way into this sort of format or something.

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.060
Uh, I think that would be really great.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:30.900
So, uh, Bob Coffey says at the very least, Nintendo should put their stuff on CD here

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:36.260
or like the streaming services, Apple music, Spotify, Tidal, pick one of them,

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:36.860
pick all of them.

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:37.580
I don't give a shit.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:42.340
Just get the music out there to a place we can actually, you know, stream it very

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:44.220
easily, but meh.

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:45.780
All right.

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.260
Moving on.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:47.140
Yeah.

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:55.340
Well, um, Epic has filed a trademark for Epic Games, Megaverse.

01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:01.780
Um, they are, they filed it at the end of 2021 and it's supposed to cover a wide

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:09.220
range of goods and services and be a new umbrella for their big overall universe

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:10.020
that they want to do.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:17.340
Uh, they're sort of putting it out there as sort of a 3D virtual space to play

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:19.620
and work and people hang out, I guess.

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:20.460
Sort of like a mobile-

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:22.380
Can they just finish their storefront, please?

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.540
And stop all this nonsense.

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:32.580
It's supposed to be a, as some sort of like mobile conversational service.

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:39.180
So, but I mean, is this like their version of Play?

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:40.540
Is it?

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:44.860
It sounds like their version of the Metaverse, like Facebook's, you want to

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.740
talk about VR 90s shit?

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:47.300
Look at that.

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.900
Look at that stuff that Facebook's trying to pull us with, with the Metaverse.

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.740
That's what this sounds like to me.

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:58.140
But like, I'm sorry, in the Metaverse, I don't want to have a me anymore.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.540
I think we've moved beyond that.

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:02.900
Well, Epic's games, Megaverse have a shopping cart available.

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.460
I swear to God, we're going to start our own Metaverse, you know, type thing.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.980
It's like, you can't even finish the storefront.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.500
Don't, don't start talking to me.

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:16.660
If Steam wants to start off their own Metaverse thing, by all means, they

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:17.940
can go ahead and talk about that.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:20.020
Cause they, at least they have a functioning storefront.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:24.780
I, I'm going to say Steam kind of has the opposite problem is that Steam tries to

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:27.860
put their pause in too many things and then doesn't do anything with it.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:32.100
And I think the case in point is their whole, do you know, Steam has a broadcast,

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.460
like a Twitch competitor built into Steam?

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.420
Where was the last, yeah, exactly.

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.820
When was the last time anyone thought about that?

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.980
That Steam has a competitor to Twitch built into Steam.

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:47.540
I, I think every time I go there, it's a lot of Russian streams.

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.580
So maybe, and maybe that's also Dota 2's popularity over there.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.060
Um, I don't, so it may be a combination of those things.

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:56.460
Maybe it's just more popular in other countries than it is here, but it's just,

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.300
it's one of those things where I'm always like, Steam just kind of like

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.300
builds it and then lets it get moldy.

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.860
Like, it's just like, it's weird.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:06.980
Anyway.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.060
But I guess good luck to Epic Games and the Megaverse.

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:14.420
But, uh, it's just one of those things where it's like, I kind of agree with

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:17.700
Loki is that it's, it's weird that they're even talking about this when

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.940
their storefront is still as bad as it is.

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:22.500
There's like so much cart before the horse type stuff.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:26.660
Like first off, like the metaverse stuff that they're talking about is like

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:30.500
white, white, it's to satisfy investors.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:34.580
It's to satisfy investors, but I wish investors could see right through this.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:37.300
It feels like the investors don't use any of the products.

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:38.420
Exactly.

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:41.700
Cause like you're talking about, like the metaverse stuff, like let's okay.

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:44.180
It's like basically ready player one kind of nonsense.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:48.180
You have to talk about wide adoption of VR, which I'm all for.

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:50.020
Like, I really hope we get to that point.

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:51.860
We are nowhere near that point.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:55.460
And then on top of that, your vision of it looks stupid.

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.020
I don't want that, that vision of it.

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:00.820
Like I would rather do the stuff that they were talking about, like with

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:02.580
HoloLens, that seems a lot cooler.

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:03.780
I mean, I just.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:06.020
I got it.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:07.620
I got it.

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.620
Like it's, it's, it's all about, yeah.

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:10.820
It's all about investors.

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:13.620
And like you say a buzz, you know, phrase.

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:16.260
It's like, that's why I knew everyone's getting in the NFTs.

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.500
It's just because, Ooh, money NFTs.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.780
I liked NFT.

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:20.740
I'll give you money now.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:23.140
It's like, Oh, I've got it.

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:23.700
I've got it.

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:27.300
I'm going to say something and you're going to hate me.

01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:30.500
And if you already hate me, you're going to hate me more.

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:31.800
Ready?

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:41.400
What if Sony bought Bungie to help them make the Sony metaverse home 2.0 and

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.320
always online experience in gaming.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.920
I don't actually, I don't actually think that, but I wanted to speak it

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:52.360
into existence just to make everybody, uh, bang their head against the

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.640
nearest flat surface.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:54.200
You're welcome.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.080
They would never do that.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.880
Deetra Rama S in chat says get out.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:00.520
Home was pretty good.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.640
I mean, that's a lot closer than say, you know, what, what they're doing

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.800
with like meta and stuff.

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:06.200
I'm sorry.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.720
I'm not going to call them that anymore with Facebook's like idea of the, the

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:15.480
metaverse thing, Facebook's being a butthole, which is just a big old rip

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:16.360
off of ready player one.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:16.760
Anyways.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.120
I mean, honestly, have you heard the latest with Facebook where now they're

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.160
threatening to pull out of Europe because Europe won't let them violate

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:27.480
privacy and sell the information to U S the company that you want to have.

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:32.600
Like they do, they do understand that they're the IOI of this, you know,

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.520
ready player one story.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.200
I mean, they're not the good company.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.480
They're the company that you distrust in like are the evil company.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.640
So I don't care if they're going to try to bring it to the world.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.520
It's just, no, it will never work.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.640
E3 VL in chat says PS home was ahead of its time.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.640
Just the load times and download was horrible.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.200
You know what?

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:54.440
You know what?

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.080
Yes.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.680
I, you know, and I I've given PlayStation home a fair amount of shit on this show.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:04.200
Where, who is the guy that used to, um, really evangelize PlayStation home here?

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.640
He used to come in on Sunday nights.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.840
He used to talk up home and all the good that I, where, where is that?

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.560
I know he rage quit and stopped listening at some point ago.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.200
Where is that?

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.800
I want to apologize to that guy.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.240
I, cause I think, I think he was onto something.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.120
It's just a bummer.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.200
Sony didn't just stick with it a little while longer.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.680
And I think, I think maybe the PlayStation three wasn't the right place for it.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:31.560
I think the PlayStation four might've been able to handle a little more what they wanted it to do,

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:35.400
where it was, um, you know, the, the trophies were actually things that you had

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.440
and all of that stuff.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:39.720
Like Sony could have had this a long time ago.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.600
It's a real bummer.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:41.960
Could have should have.

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:42.200
Yeah.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.480
Could have should have would have.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:43.980
All right.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:45.420
Anyway.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.280
Um, as 200 Matt says, yeah, PlayStation home was ahead of its time.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.640
Same with game room.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.880
Same with one versus a hundred, just to touch it.

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:57.560
Well, if I can continue with what I was going to say in my story, I guess.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.060
Yeah.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.100
Okay.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:05.160
Um, they're claiming that the investment is going to, and this is a quote, accelerate the

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.800
work around building connected social experiences in Fortnite Rocket League and Fall Guys.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:16.840
And also, you know, helping, uh, you know, developers and other creators use Unreal

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.960
Engine and the Epic, uh, services and their online store and stuff like that.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:29.560
So it's, I think it's meant to drive content and communication.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:35.160
So it also sounds to me that Epic games is saying the mega verse is just Fortnite.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.440
No rocket league.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.480
And this is one.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.080
No, they absolutely do.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:45.000
But isn't it even better if Epic can tie all that into Fortnite?

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:50.280
I, I, I feel like it's just, it's just be a, such a thing for them to do anyway.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.520
All right.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.840
Um, moving on, I think we're over to Loki.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:56.760
Yeah.

01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:03.720
So like the everybody's been asking, Hey, Rockstar, when are you going to make Grand Theft Auto six?

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:06.600
Except I haven't been asking that cause I just don't care anymore.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.480
I made you care, right?

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.680
Just, I'm not going to ask about it.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:15.400
So they finally have decided to publish a statement on it and saying that, Hey, with

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:20.280
unprecedented longevity of Grand Theft Auto five, we know many of you have been asking about a new

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.880
entry in the Grand Theft Auto series.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.840
Yeah, because it's been over almost 10 years now.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:30.920
Um, and with every new project we embark on, our goal is the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.560
Okay.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:37.720
So basically they're, they're looking to push, you know, the boundaries of gaming and whatnot,

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:41.880
and that their next entry is going to be, is in active development.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.520
And they're looking to push those boundaries as well.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:50.520
So yes, in development, who knows when the hell it's coming out?

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.120
Well, it's been in development since like Red Dead Redemption two.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:55.560
So I mean, like, I don't know.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:01.560
I was going to say the fact that they're working on a Grand Theft Auto six should surprise nobody.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.320
No, it's not a surprise.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.880
But it's just interesting to hear them acknowledge it for a change.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.680
You know, like, Oh yes, that super obvious thing.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.840
And they're the big, big elephant in the room.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.320
Here it is.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.640
And also on top of that, though, like, I don't like,

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.080
I'm not giving them the benefit of the doubt here.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.840
Like, I need to see this game.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:26.120
You know, I can't throw trust into companies anymore.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.800
Like, especially with some of the stuff that they've tried to pull with certain games.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.640
They make quality games, yes.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:35.080
But they also can kind of rush to get things done.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.400
Yeah, I'm excited about it.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:41.320
Assuming that the online or that the single player campaign's good,

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.560
because that's really all I'm interested in online.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.480
Yeah, not for me.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:51.400
LM Orchard in our chat says GTA six in the metaverse.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.360
Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna need you to come.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.280
Come put your face close to your mobile device or monitor screen.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.760
Come come put your face close to it so I can slap you.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.160
Come here.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:01.480
Come here.

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.000
Come here.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
They're not doing that in the metaverse.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.200
And they already have, was it?

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.920
They announced that they're doing San Andreas, remember?

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:15.080
And probably about the same company that did the remaster do the VR version.

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.280
So good luck with that.

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.480
That's going to be a horror show.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.440
But you know, I'm all down.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.840
I'm down to see it whenever the hell that comes out.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:29.720
All right, look, enough enough metaverse, enough VR, AR, enough of that.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:35.160
Why don't we why don't we talk about a company that likes to make retro inspired things?

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.960
Let's talk about Yacht Club Games and their latest project, which they unveiled this week.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:43.720
It's called Mina the Hollower is the name of it.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.200
It's a 60 frame a second, and they're calling it a Game Boy Color homage.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.280
But I don't know if it looks Game Boy Color to me.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:52.840
I guess so.

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:57.960
It just looks more of a product of that era, like Shovel Knight was and so forth.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.760
But yeah, they're making it run at 60 frames a second.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:04.840
It's a top down adventure game full of mystery and horror.

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.880
They're saying Link's Awakening meets Castlevania with a sprinkle of Dark Souls.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.480
Why does everything have to be Dark Souls?

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:14.920
Whatever to me, it's going to be because it's hard.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.360
Doesn't mean it's Dark Souls.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:20.280
I saw Star Tropics, but Gothic, that's what I saw in it.

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:23.640
But I guess there's similarities to all those topics.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.480
Loki, I'm going to need you to put your face really close to the TV, please.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.520
We're going to need to time you out.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.800
Someone attempt ban Loki.

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.520
Anyway, time out, Loki, 60 seconds.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:44.280
All right, the game is currently in production and all this stuff.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:47.960
And if you want to get on the game now, you can go to Kickstarter.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.200
That's kind of interesting.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:55.400
But it's one of those things where, like, because, you know, I've been very nervous

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.280
about backing.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:01.160
I really haven't done one in a long time, and I'm probably not going to because just

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:04.040
there's been too many projects on Kickstarter that don't deliver.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.280
And that's the reality from my perspective.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:13.000
But I also understand where Yacht Club Games, who found that success for Shovel Knight,

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
which truly was one of the great Kickstarter success stories.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.840
I can understand why they're going back to their roots a little bit with this.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.840
I fully expect this game will come out.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:27.240
I mean, the trailer was pretty outstanding and shows that the game is far enough along

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.120
in development.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:31.240
And I mean, shit, they've already blown through their goal.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.800
They were only trying to raise $311,000.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.960
They've already hit $703,000.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.400
They're well past their goal.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.600
The game will happen.

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.520
It's just, you know, how many stretch goals are they going to hit?

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.680
But it is on Kickstarter.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.040
So they're up to, oh, this might interest you, DarkSakura.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:52.760
The next stretch goal at $800,000, which I'm sure they'll hit because there are 22 days

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:58.520
left in this, is the Mac and Linux port of the game will be the $800,000 goal.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.440
They've already reached sound test, cheat codes, and new game plus.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.400
So Mac and Linux port is up next for me.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.040
I did spend money on a Kickstarter.

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.920
Oh, yeah.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.000
Somebody dropped that on my doorstep too.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.560
Uh, which, um, you know, again, I just kind of feel the way I feel about Kickstarter.

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.360
So I didn't back it, but I'd be curious when that game comes out.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:26.440
Yeah.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.120
So anyway, what was the name of drag?

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.560
Her was the name of it or something like that, right?

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:31.720
Yeah.

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:32.200
Drag her.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.480
It looks pretty funny.

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.480
It looks like everybody looks like Trixie Mattel.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:35.980
Yeah.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.040
Uh, and Mike Deaf points out the Kickstarter isn't to fund the game.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.680
The Kickstarter is to fund future projects for the franchise, like merch and future spinoffs.

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.160
Well, but it does affect the game.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.320
Like I know that was the line they're giving, but look, the stretch goal they're on Mac

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.720
and Linux port that directly relates new game.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.120
Plus these are things that relate to the game.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.360
So it's, I get it.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:58.840
I get it.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:05.000
But it, and when I do feel more comfortable about Kickstarters and to be clear is when

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.560
the Kickstarter is more to fund the publishing of the game, like I already have a finished

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:17.240
product, I just need to make the cartridges to put Pixel Poops 2 on to sell, you know,

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.000
the actual NES cartridges.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.160
That's where Kickstarters make more sense to me.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.120
So that way, you know, you're only funding as many of those as actually need to be made.

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.280
So that's, um, yeah.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:35.880
Anyway, um, let's see, uh, as shown here, Matt says when yacht club games did the Kickstarter

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.880
campaign for Shovel Knight, they provided consistent and fully transparent updates.

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.720
So the community never felt it was ghosted and saw a lot of products.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.160
Um, yeah.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:50.520
So, uh, I think that's why this Kickstarter kind of feels a little bit different.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.160
That's for sure.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:52.360
All right.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:56.040
Well, on a retro note, roll the bumper for the next segment.

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:12.680
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.000
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.640
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.600
All right.

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:27.480
But this time dark Sakura has a, uh, classic electronic handheld that she's going to be

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.920
sharing with us here.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.080
Uh, so dark Sakura, what is the, uh, classic handheld?

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.160
It is, uh, Mattel electronics football.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:44.680
And I'm talking about a old, uh, this was released in 1977.

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:50.040
There was, depending on which version was released, like there was a rerelease of it.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.000
There was football or football one, cause there was a football two later.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:28:01.000
Um, but it was basically, um, you had like little dots that represented the players and

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:01.960
everything.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:06.360
Um, there were, it's a lot of differences between some of the different models too.

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:13.720
The, the font on the first edition of it was that sort of seventies looking digital looking

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.200
font.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:23.000
Um, it also, uh, the early ones came with an AC adapter jack that was removed on later

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.080
models so that it would only run on battery.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:32.920
Um, and, uh, you know, there were other changes that they made for other markets.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:39.400
Um, but, uh, uh, some of them had like different, uh, stickers on the back.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:45.400
Like one of them said, try fresh batteries written, uh, on a, the back of the, of the

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:45.800
machine.

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.760
Um, it was released in June, 1977.

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:54.680
It was the second game that was released by Mattel auto race was the first, it was sold

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:55.400
through Sears.

01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:02.200
Um, they, uh, they had made less than a hundred thousand of them.

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:07.640
And then Sears, uh, said that they didn't think the game would be a big seller.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:13.000
And so, uh, they stopped production on football and auto race.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
And then in six months, uh, Sears was proven wrong.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.200
So they started the production up again and, uh, sold quite a bit of them.

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:29.960
As many as 500,000, uh, units by a midweek, uh, sorry, by, uh, uh, selling that many a

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.360
week by mid February, 1978.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.640
Um, so yeah, it's lippy blippy buttons.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.520
And didn't they do a re-release of this?

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:41.880
I think, cause I think we have it.

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:44.840
Um, somebody in chat is asking about that teacher.

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.920
Um, S says, didn't they also re-release this?

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:51.400
And so you are probably on the right track and yeah, cause I know we have it somewhere.

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.400
I'm going to double check something real quick.

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:56.840
Yeah, sure.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.360
Uh, getting some other comments in chat.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:01.480
Um, dark Tatsuya says I've heard of it, but don't think I had one.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:04.520
Uh, fifth dream says I played that once at a friend's house and I was little, though

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.800
I have no interest in football, but I had interest in electronic games.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:08.600
Big same.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.800
I played this, but it was because I thought electronics were cool.

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:12.280
Yeah.

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:15.640
It was re-released and you can get it for 150 bucks on Amazon.

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:16.520
Nice.

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:17.720
Uh, tiger cloud points out.

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.440
I had a cameo in guardians of the galaxy volume two.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.000
Interesting.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.280
That might also explain why they felt the need to reprint it at some point.

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:28.040
So, uh, fifth dream says the definition of beep boop.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:29.500
Yes.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:35.560
Well, and you can still pick up, you know, the original ones for pretty inexpensive,

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.920
like on eBay and whatnot.

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:43.160
Um, there's also a baseball, there was subchase that came out in 1978.

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:49.480
Um, you can even get like a little key chain version of, uh, of football.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:55.080
It's like, it's like the world's smallest, you know, you know, or yeah, the world's

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:57.160
coolest or world's smallest edition or something.

01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.720
And, uh, it actually works.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:04.440
So, you know, you can still get in on that action.

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.280
They still take the same bat.

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:10.200
We've been using the same batteries for however many years it'll work.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.160
Uh, Ella mortured in chat says I loved the seventies and eighties attempts at sports

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:18.200
games that had almost no resemblance to the actual sports.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.000
Yeah, but electronics were cool.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.600
So, and hence why we celebrate one every month here in 2022 with our classic electronic

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:32.760
handheld of the month and lots of bleeps and not to be confused with blinks and blunks.

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:33.160
Yes.

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:35.560
Uh, handheld electronic football.

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:37.080
A very classic.

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.520
And again, if you're listening on the podcast feed, you can't see the video of this.

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:43.720
I think the visual really sparks that memory for a lot of people.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:48.280
So I really encourage you to Google like image, one of these Mattel handheld electronic

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.680
football and, and I'm sorry, was it Mattel?

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:52.040
Yeah, Mattel.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:52.760
Yeah, it was Mattel.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:56.280
So I really encourage you to look, uh, and by the way, actually this, um, YouTube

01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:58.840
we're playing here actually says this is one of the remade ones.

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.520
This isn't the one from the seventies.

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:05.320
So it's enough, you know, that it shows how the game played.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:09.560
I mean, gosh, these things, they were pretty inexpensive.

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:13.160
I think the rereleases and now though you can't really find them as well anymore,

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.920
which is why they've gone up inexpensive.

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:15.420
Yeah.

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:16.680
All right.

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:17.640
Well, there you go.

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:18.140
Great pick.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:24.120
Uh, we'll get another one next month, uh, with our classic electronic handheld of the

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:24.600
month.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:25.000
Awesome.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:25.500
Awesome.

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:26.540
All right.

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:31.900
Uh, we are going to get into our next segment, which is some rapid fire news and quickly

01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:34.540
talk about some other things going on in the gaming industry.

01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:35.040
Loki.

01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:36.140
Yeah.

01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:41.180
So suicide squad killed the justice league has been delayed to 2023.

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:47.260
They need more time, you know, to make the game as polished as they can possibly be.

01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:49.500
No big deal.

01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:56.380
Um, and then there's this funny mod that's coming out for halo three on PC.

01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.100
It adds a Chevy Tahoe to it.

01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:00.460
Now why a Chevy Tahoe?

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:05.500
Because that was in the trailer for the new paramount plus series, which doesn't make

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:11.660
any sense that this vintage 500 year old Chevy Tahoe would be in there, but because, you

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:13.100
know, product placement is a thing.

01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:16.780
Now it's a thing in your PC version of halo three.

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:17.680
Sure.

01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:19.340
Why not?

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:21.600
Yeah.

01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:22.880
All right.

01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:25.180
Uh, Dar Sarah.

01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:31.580
So, um, well, that, uh, Nickelodeon, uh, all star brawl is getting a new character.

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:34.940
Uh, they are getting, uh, the shredder.

01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:38.140
Maybe all that hardware is for making coleslaw.

01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:39.900
Tonight I dine on turtle soup.

01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:42.860
But yeah, he is.

01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:51.180
Yeah, he is in the game and it is definitely, you know, nineties cartoon shredder.

01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:59.020
And then, uh, in other news, uh, and this, this is pertinent to a lot of our listeners

01:33:59.020 --> 01:33:59.520
interests.

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:07.740
Um, the Pokemon legends, uh, has sold, uh, 6.5 million copies worldwide in seven days.

01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:13.260
And it puts it above Pokemon sword and shield in terms of its sales.

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:17.260
So good job, consumer horse.

01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:19.180
Did you say seven days?

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:21.900
I think you did.

01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:26.140
You know, all that makes me one is the, the bingo.

01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:30.380
Bob coffee and chat points out.

01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:33.420
It would have sold more if they fucking ship more than five copies.

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:34.460
You know, that's a good point.

01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:38.300
There's a lot of people that didn't even get their copy until this week.

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:41.180
I guess some of the distribution was having problems.

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:45.500
I mean, shock and in this day and age, uh, you know, I got mine digitally, so it was

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.060
whatever.

01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:49.740
But I think a lot of people that did opt for the physical edition, for whatever reason,

01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:52.380
you're entitled to that, uh, had to wait a little longer.

01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:58.060
Cause I think the official ones from, from like the Pokemon store online or whatever

01:34:58.060 --> 01:34:58.860
took were delayed.

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:00.060
Like most of those were delayed.

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:06.700
So it is interesting that it sold so well, uh, even amongst all those issues, but I think

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:11.740
just also goes to show the strength that, um, you know, the Pokemon fandom is craving,

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.740
uh, some other types of ideas.

01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:18.780
And I think it all but guarantees we will see this legends concept again, whether it

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:24.540
is legitimately a sequel to legends or like even, uh, the next mainline game, looking

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:28.860
a little more, uh, like a hybrid, uh, we'll see, we will see.

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:31.500
So, oh wow.

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:37.660
Bob coffee says, uh, kind of clarifying their comments as our store only received five copies.

01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:38.540
Holy moly.

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:42.300
Yeah, I guess, uh, LOL supply chain.

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.860
I guess the rest were, uh, stuck in the Panama canal.

01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:50.300
Uh, DJ Ramirez says one of our staffers got her Pokemon brilliant diamond late due to

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.580
shipping from Pokemon.

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:54.220
When she got it, she ended up with two copies of the game.

01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:57.100
I guess good things come to those who wait.

01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:57.900
It was interest.

01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:01.420
The Pokemon bread while it was in transit.

01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:04.860
I don't know the egg hatched insert joke here.

01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:06.060
All right.

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.980
Let's, uh, travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games, uh,

01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:13.500
that are going to try to sell 6.5 million copies next week.

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.740
Let's start in the U S they'll try.

01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:16.940
They'll try.

01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:18.700
Let's see if any of them can do it.

01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:24.620
Loki, any, anything in the U S uh, yeah, we've got all the Ali world on PC, Nintendo switch,

01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:32.780
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series, uh, Sifu on PC, PlayStation

01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:38.540
four and PlayStation five crossfire X on Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:43.500
And then we have all of the kingdom hearts coming to Nintendo switch.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:52.780
So kingdom hearts, HD 1.5 remix, uh, HD 2.5 remix, HD 2.8 final chapter prologue and kingdom

01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:55.340
hearts three all on Nintendo switch.

01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:57.900
And last but not least lost arc on PC.

01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:00.300
Oh, that lost arc.

01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:01.980
A lot of people trying to sell me on that one.

01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:03.180
I might have to check that out.

01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:04.140
Sounds pretty interesting.

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.060
Uh, going over to Japan and checking out the releases this week.

01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.940
We've got, we've got some titles this week on the Nintendo switch.

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:14.860
Let me tell you, we have a game called let's play curling is coming out.

01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:15.580
Fuck yeah.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:16.220
Curling.

01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:21.100
I mean, and how, how, uh, at pro pro the timing is with the Olympics going on right now.

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:24.620
I know we haven't brought that up yet, but you know, that's, that is going on.

01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:30.220
And curling curling is that thing that like used to be like the whole, Hey, did you stay

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:33.660
up until 2 AM and watch the curling and like, it used to be like that thing that nobody

01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:34.140
knew about.

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:37.660
And now I do feel like it's that thing that like, people are like, Oh, it's the winter

01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:37.980
Olympics.

01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:38.780
You know what that means?

01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:39.180
Curling.

01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:40.540
It's the only time it's on TV.

01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:41.020
Fuck yeah.

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:41.500
Curling.

01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:42.780
Okay.

01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:44.140
I have to make a side note.

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:46.540
That should be the name of the U S release of this game.

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:47.020
Fuck yeah.

01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:47.500
Curling.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:53.260
You know, I like the show Canada's worst driver when it was on.

01:37:53.900 --> 01:38:01.260
They, they, for one of their driving accuracy things like to do control, they have, they

01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:02.060
had curling.

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:05.900
They created a giant puck and you had to steer it with the car.

01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:09.340
Sounds awesome.

01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:11.180
That's the most Canadian thing I've ever heard.

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:14.380
Another big release in Japan this week.

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:16.860
Uh, I'm sorry, this is too good.

01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:23.340
It's by idea factory on the switch called my next life as a villainous, all roots lead

01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:24.140
to doom.

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.740
Pirates that stir the waters.

01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:27.100
I love it.

01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:30.380
There's so many subtitles and they're all great.

01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:32.060
That's like three games in one.

01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:32.940
Which, what is it?

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:36.140
A villainous routes leading to doom or pirates?

01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:37.260
Are you sure it's not about me?

01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:41.500
I did think of you when I read this dark soccer, you should take a look.

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:41.820
Hold on.

01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.020
I'll just post this in the chat.

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:43.420
I don't care.

01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:43.740
Hold on.

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:45.420
I'm going to post this link in the chat.

01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:48.540
Uh, because then when you look at the game, you're going to be like, what the fuck is

01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:48.780
this?

01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:51.740
This isn't, this isn't any of those things at all, actually.

01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:54.860
Uh, and, uh, let's see orange, right.

01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:57.420
In chat points out, it's a light novel.

01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:02.780
And yeah, when you actually kind of look at the box art and what it's about, um, it's,

01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:08.300
uh, the character has memories of her previous life as a high school girl in the world of

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.020
fortune lover.

01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:13.660
She was reincarnated as a villainous who stood in between the love of the main characters

01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:19.500
whose endings only lead to a future of exile or death, but managed to avoid the destruction

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.940
flags of the game safely.

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:26.380
So this, there's a whole lot of drama going on in this game.

01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:32.300
There's some stories in this, but, um, it's the type of stories.

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:33.900
It does check out that.

01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:38.700
Check out some of those screenshots that, uh, there's some, uh, there's some things going

01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:39.740
on in those screenshots.

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:43.260
Anyway, those are your big titles on the squit switch this week.

01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:47.500
So you get curling or trashy romance novel game.

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.420
Uh, it's kind of your picks.

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:50.780
Why not both?

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:52.380
Why, why not?

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:56.860
But at the same time, my life as a villainous eternal doom in curling.

01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:58.780
All right.

01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:01.740
Anyway, there's dark soccer's game.

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:06.940
I actually found something on the site that interests me a lot more.

01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:07.740
Oh, what's that?

01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.900
That's the switch version of Pocky and Rocky.

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:15.980
Oh, uh, meanwhile on the PlayStation five, uh, some releases this week chorus, uh, a

01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:19.100
plague tale innocence gets its Japanese release this week.

01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:20.860
And there are some peripherals as well.

01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:25.580
There's, uh, um, like a racing wheel that comes out that supports some games and all

01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:26.540
that good stuff.

01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:28.460
Um, yeah, so there you go.

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:30.060
Those are your Japanese releases.

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.340
How about the UK dark soccer?

01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:35.420
In the UK, we have summer in Mara.

01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:38.380
Uh, that is, um, February 11th.

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:39.980
Actually, all of these are on February 11th.

01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:45.660
Uh, we have bass master fishing, deluxe 20, uh, 20, 22.

01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:50.060
Uh, you have unbound worlds apart for PlayStation.

01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:54.940
And then on the switch, the grand theft auto, uh, the, the trilogy, the definitive.

01:40:57.180 --> 01:40:59.740
The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the VV.

01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:06.860
Sorry, I'm laughing at dark Tetsuya's comment and chat card curling Sakura.

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:07.760
No.

01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:09.760
Yes.

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:12.000
No.

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:12.800
Yes.

01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:14.560
No.

01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:15.200
Yes.

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:17.820
Have to say yes to that.

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:18.320
Yay.

01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:19.280
Yes.

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:20.240
All right.

01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:23.020
Moving on.

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.420
Let's talk about another thing.

01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:28.460
A lot of people say no or yes to in our next story.

01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:28.960
Loki.

01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:31.020
Uh, yes.

01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:34.060
Everyone's favorite game of the week or game of the day.

01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:39.420
I guess a wordle has been purchased by the New York times because the New York times

01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:46.540
is not one to bow down from, uh, joining in the game or game company acquisition.

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:50.940
That is, you know, Sony and Microsoft New York times Salsas.

01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:56.780
Poison to be a, you know, big game developer publisher house or whatever.

01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:00.220
Um, no, really like the advertisement.

01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:05.580
Maybe, you know, going to bring people to their site or something, um,

01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:07.660
put it behind their paywall eventually.

01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:07.980
Oh God.

01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:08.700
I hope not.

01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:09.660
Oh, they will.

01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:10.300
They will.

01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:13.900
If you look, if you read their comments, they're like, oh, we're not putting it behind a paywall

01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:14.400
initially.

01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:16.240
Initially.

01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:20.860
Like they're digital subscription growth strategy.

01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:21.420
Yeah.

01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:21.920
Yeah.

01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:29.500
Congrats to the New York times who was, uh, honestly, uh, not knowing enough about technology

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.020
and the fact that people have already right.

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:32.780
Click, save this game to play for it.

01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:34.220
Like literally, literally that's the thing.

01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:37.820
Everybody's like, you could just right click, save wordle and you can just play it, uh, for

01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:42.220
the, for the next like five years, uh, without worrying about a paywall or anything like

01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:42.780
that.

01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:47.660
Uh, so congrats to the New York times for really being dumb enough to buy wordle now

01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:51.580
before, you know, I just sound like I'm a complete jerk.

01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:57.020
I'll say major, major props to the guy and I forgot his name, but his last name is something

01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:02.060
like word wordle or something like he has a very, his, like his last name is very similar

01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:02.940
to the name of the games.

01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:04.220
It's kind of funny.

01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:04.700
I do.

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:07.180
I do not fault that guy one bit.

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:07.580
Good.

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.260
In fact, good on him.

01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:12.460
Good on the spouse that inspired the game apparently and all that stuff.

01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:14.060
Cause she liked word games or whatever.

01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:19.020
Good on both of them for taking the money and running and cashing that check and getting

01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:20.300
an early retirement.

01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:23.340
I don't fault them one goddamn bit and neither should anyone.

01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:24.940
Uh, good for them.

01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:30.140
Uh, I think the New York times was really boneheaded in this.

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:34.140
Uh, but now they'll own the trademark.

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:39.020
Um, there isn't one now, but you, you betcha, uh, New York times is going to file a trademark

01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:42.700
and they would be very smart to try to get on a mobile app or something like that.

01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:48.700
But, uh, I just, I think the wordle gas tank only has so much fuel left in it and yeah,

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:52.940
it's kind of the social media thing of the moment, but we're still in the, you know,

01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:58.220
hopefully closing days of the pandemic where, you know, we're not getting together in person

01:43:58.220 --> 01:43:59.340
the way that we used to.

01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:03.580
So sharing our wordle scores online is one of those things that brings some of us joy.

01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:06.780
Um, but eventually we're going to be back in person again.

01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:11.900
And I just think wordle is going to fade out as quickly into the night as it showed up.

01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:15.260
Um, and there's so many wordle clones now.

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:18.700
Uh, thank you, Bobby Blackwell for reminding me, Josh Wardle was the guy's name.

01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:19.420
Thank you.

01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:20.220
Uh, and point out.

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.580
And yeah, he talked about this in his story.

01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:24.700
I rebuilt wordle in C64 basic.

01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:24.940
Yeah.

01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:25.660
It's interesting.

01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:27.500
Wordle has actually, you know what wordle is?

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:28.940
It's flappy bird.

01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:31.100
Wordle is flappy bird.

01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:32.300
That's exactly what it is.

01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:34.140
And now it's like that.

01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:35.100
It's that clone.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:36.700
That's going to show up everywhere.

01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:41.660
Cause we've seen, I've seen Mike Deft posting the wordle in Spanish scores.

01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:44.940
I see loodle with all the naughty words like twats.

01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:47.340
That's that one's fun.

01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:51.500
Uh, and then, uh, what I see the one with like the 10 letter long words and all this

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:55.580
stuff, like there are just, there are so many knockoffs of wordle and it's just like when

01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:56.700
flappy bird came out.

01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:57.340
Right.

01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:02.220
Then everything in the app store was some rip off of, or, and Google play and all of

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:04.300
it was just, and then there was flappy vog.

01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:08.780
Bobby Blackwell built flappy vog, which I was going to say is still playable on the

01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:12.860
site, but I actually think that's a lie because I think the, the integration that

01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:14.140
it uses no longer works.

01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:19.420
How dare you render it as a HTML five app.

01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:19.660
Yeah.

01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:21.100
And who's going to take the time to do that.

01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:30.220
So, um, so now Bobby says, this is, this is my good pet project to learn new languages.

01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:33.980
And he talked about this on his show a little bit is that, uh, you know, when you

01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:39.260
build your first game, the way that Loki did it is the wrong way to do it.

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:45.020
You do not start your first game being some overly ambitious project about cars

01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:47.660
getting into big wrecks, and then you don't end up finishing them.

01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:48.220
No offense.

01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:50.380
The game you did finish turned out great.

01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:51.100
There was no wrecks.

01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:58.460
But Bobby says, start with poker, start with hangman, start with flappy bird, start

01:45:58.460 --> 01:45:59.820
with wordle.

01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:05.420
So wordle is just the flappy bird of 2022 is really what it is.

01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:06.300
And that's, that's it.

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.220
So, all right.

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.540
And, uh, Bobby bringing the technical explanation.

01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:14.140
I knew it was something, uh, it's not playable anymore due to the unity.

01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:17.420
Game player is no longer supported by browsers.

01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:21.100
So if you had an old browser or something, it might work, but, um, not likely.

01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:23.740
So, uh, dark to see it says I concur with Rob.

01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:27.500
Start with something simple, breakout space, invaders, that kind of thing.

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:28.000
Yeah.

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:33.260
Um, or build a game for a system that doesn't exist anymore.

01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:33.420
Right?

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:34.060
Dark Sakura.

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:35.520
Hmm.

01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:37.180
Yeah, there is that.

01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:43.260
So you had to say that right when I'm drinking, um, there is a game called eye of typhoon

01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:48.220
and, uh, it is, uh, being released in the United States.

01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:53.420
Um, it actually is, uh, a Korea, a South Korean game.

01:46:53.980 --> 01:47:00.860
And, uh, not only is it going to be getting a PC release, it's coming out on the 3dio.

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:04.300
Oh, guess who has a 3dio.

01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:07.420
I know you, you must have one.

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:08.700
I think we have a 3dio.

01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:10.540
But is it hooked up now?

01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.420
Let me go.

01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:13.740
Bobby Black Wolf is your, of course he just popped up.

01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:14.380
I have a 3dio.

01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:15.020
Is it hooked up?

01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:16.560
It's okay.

01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:22.380
Bobby, Bobby, get close to the monitor, Bobby.

01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:29.420
I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell, uh, tell Dan that we need this game.

01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:31.020
No, I have seen Bobby's living room.

01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:32.060
It's, it's pretty great.

01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:35.980
Get Bobby to post a picture of the box collection from the seventies and eighties.

01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:37.580
That's the really impressive part.

01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:43.500
Well, we're, uh, we talked about actually Dan's thinking of selling the Mustang and

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.100
we're going to convert the garage.

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:45.740
Oh, wowee.

01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:47.100
That's a big step.

01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:52.060
Yeah, but we're thinking of converting the garage to our new game room.

01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:58.540
But who, who would have thought a new 3dio game in the year 2022, but this, this is going

01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:04.780
to be huge for, um, um, you know, somebody, no people that are in the retro scene, Genesis

01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:07.820
game that came out, that everyone was all hot and bothered over.

01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:09.020
And then it didn't play very well.

01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:15.020
Well, I mean, and people are making games for the Nintendo entertainment system and

01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:16.780
actually putting them on cartridges.

01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:21.820
Can you believe what a world who would do that?

01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:27.340
Uh, LM orchard and chat says, if I had a 3dio, it would just be the machine that plays Zelda,

01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:28.860
the Wanda Gamelon.

01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:29.100
Yeah.

01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:33.180
For five minutes until you were a member, how fucking terrible that game really was.

01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:38.220
I mean, that game exists to be in awesome games done quick and summer games done quick

01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.300
and, uh, and then that's it.

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:45.420
Like it's a game does not hold up well in my, in my humble opinion.

01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:47.100
All right.

01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:51.980
Uh, let's talk about something we hope doesn't hold up very well over time.

01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:52.380
Loki.

01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:54.140
Yes.

01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:55.180
Yes.

01:48:55.180 --> 01:49:00.860
It is our weekly discussion of NFTs and how I just, okay.

01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:04.300
I want to point out Loki had like four stories about NFTs tonight.

01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:05.100
I said, you know what?

01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:10.060
Not today, Satan, not, not, not, not calling Loki Satan, but I'm calling, you know what

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:15.260
Satan said not to, I'm burying this in part B of the show and you know what we can just,

01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:17.980
we're going to put it in one segment and then be done with it.

01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:24.060
I'm not going to talk about this half the show again, but please give us our update

01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:27.420
on these new fucked up things.

01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:28.300
Yeah.

01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:33.660
So itch.io, um, made a statement on Twitter talking about NFTs saying NFTs are scams.

01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:39.340
And if you think they're legitimately useful for anything other than the exploitation of

01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:44.380
creators, financial scams, and the destruction of the planet, we ask, please reevaluate your

01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:45.100
life choices.

01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:48.540
So that sums of that pretty well, I think.

01:49:49.340 --> 01:50:00.140
Um, and then of course we had team 17 trying to license the worms for NFTs and then that

01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:02.940
got, you know, struck down pretty fast.

01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.860
People were very angry at that.

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:11.580
And so they have decided to, um, not do that anymore.

01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:14.860
There's many people in chat by the way, cheering for itch.io.

01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:18.940
If you'd like to show your support for itch.io, you can go to the website and then search

01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:22.380
for tech master games and then buy the game that's available there.

01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:25.260
And that'll be showing itch.io that you support their stance.

01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:25.500
Right.

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:25.820
Loki.

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:27.340
Right.

01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:32.940
Um, so yeah, they, they decided to go ahead master games and then buy the game that comes

01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:35.580
up or just, yeah, search for pixel two summer too.

01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:37.180
Um, yeah.

01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:42.460
So apparently they have decided to, um, well, I grow crab games.

01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:47.900
Basically you put out a tweet saying that they believe that NFTs cannot be environmentally

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:51.660
friendly or useful and are really just an overall grift.

01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:57.660
Please do not harass the employees at team 17 or devs under their umbrellas as this decision

01:50:57.660 --> 01:51:00.940
seems to have taken everyone off guard and likely came from the very top.

01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:03.900
Um, which is unfortunate.

01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:09.340
Then of course, um, you have, you know, companies that are kind of changing their position on

01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:09.420
it.

01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:17.580
So EA, um, Andrew Wilson is saying now that, um, going from calling NFTs the important

01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:23.660
part of the future of our industry to, you know, walking away from them slightly and,

01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:24.860
you know, anything that brings.

01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:27.420
It's basically, let me try to see here.

01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:30.060
It says right now it's not something we're driving hard on.

01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:39.180
Um, you know, looking like needed to past, uh, capital fads around 3d AR and VR.

01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:44.940
Sony wants, or I should say meta wants to talk to you about their metaverse, you know,

01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:46.540
if you want to talk about fads.

01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:52.060
Um, by the way, by the way, random tangent, but it's, it's more important than, um, uh,

01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:54.140
NFTs and that's talking about poop.

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:58.460
And Bobby Blacklove points out that pixel poops number two apparently came out a year

01:51:58.460 --> 01:51:59.020
ago.

01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:03.420
Uh, the itch IO page says he bought it 357 days ago.

01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:05.900
I, what is time anymore in a pandemic?

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:06.860
Did you know that Loki?

01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:07.820
It's, it's the birthday.

01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:09.980
How about that?

01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:12.940
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Bobby bought it day one.

01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:15.740
So that's, you know, that means yesterday was the first birthday.

01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:18.540
How about that?

01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.300
Happy birthday poop.

01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:25.420
Anyway, uh, back to NFT.

01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:26.860
Yes.

01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:30.540
And then, then of course you have the companies that are doubling down on it.

01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:38.300
And so Ubisoft course is, uh, gifting NFTs to their employees, which I'm sure really

01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:39.660
appreciate that.

01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:44.860
Uh, one of those is, uh, one to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ghost recon.

01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:49.740
Um, one developer said, you know, we hate this crypto stuff.

01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:50.140
Okay.

01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:53.660
You know, with, um, Ubisoft saying, okay, come get some.

01:52:54.380 --> 01:53:03.260
Um, they don't get it is basically the tone, um, that the developers think that they have

01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:05.100
with this whole Ubisoft reports platform.

01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:12.220
Um, again, I'm going to interrupt your NFT talk because, uh, it has come to my attention

01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:14.140
that my brain blue screened of death.

01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:18.380
Uh, when talking about the numbers there, uh, there's actually 365 days in a year and

01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:19.980
my brain did something with those numbers.

01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:23.500
So it's actually the birthday of pixel poops is February 13th.

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:24.220
So it's coming up.

01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:26.780
So it's not too late to buy the game of cake.

01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:33.980
I mean, it came out like never was next week, but yeah, but I mean, Loki, seriously, you

01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:35.020
deserve a cake.

01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:36.220
So get yourself a cake.

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:43.580
Um, and then last but not least, Konami remains committed to the future of the NFT market

01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:44.060
projects.

01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:46.060
So this is not the end.

01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:52.300
They will be producing more NFTs because they made money off of absolutely literally nothing,

01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:53.980
zero effort on their part.

01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:57.020
And so of course, why wouldn't they double down on this?

01:53:57.020 --> 01:54:00.460
Besides, I hear the pachinko business isn't doing that great in Japan right now.

01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:03.020
So yeah.

01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:06.140
Um, all right.

01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:13.020
Every everybody with me on the count of three, one, two, three.

01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:20.220
Thank you.

01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:26.300
And as with that, we've purged the entities from our system.

01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:27.100
Thank you.

01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:31.340
Uh, Chad is suggesting that we have some theme music to go with this, such as Yakety Sax

01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:31.820
or something.

01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:37.580
I mean, those songs are copyright and I don't know, maybe there's some Pokemon music we

01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:38.060
can play.

01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:44.460
They'll play the team rocket theme or whatever the equivalent.

01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:47.580
Yes.

01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:50.380
Okay.

01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:50.700
Okay.

01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:54.780
I'll be, I'll be, when we get to the new setup, I'll be set up for that.

01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:59.740
So we'll do that team galaxy or whatever they were called in gen four.

01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:00.700
All right.

01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:02.060
Moving on.

01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:05.020
Let's talk about something that's actually pretty cool.

01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:09.580
Let's talk about, uh, finally PlayStation integration with discord.

01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:14.220
Um, now I kind of thought you could do this before you could already integrate like your

01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:19.580
PlayStation tag in discord, but now you can go a step further and discord will now show

01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:23.820
like what games you're actually playing on PlayStation four, PlayStation five.

01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:28.940
In fact, when you signed into discord recently, excuse me, sorry.

01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:32.780
Hopefully you'd have joined the vog network discord server, which is available at vog

01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:35.900
network.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord.

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:39.500
That's one of those places you can send me messages throughout the week that create good

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:42.140
topic ideas that then I want to talk about it on the show.

01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:43.820
Um, that's one place to message me.

01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:45.740
Um, or dark soccer.

01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:49.260
If you want to talk about Deb by daylight or anything like that, or Loki, if you want

01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:53.580
to talk about Minecraft or how much you're watching his videos and enjoying them, uh,

01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:57.260
you can do that on our discord vognetwork.com slash discord, and you can also now connect

01:55:57.260 --> 01:56:02.380
your PlayStation four and five, your PSN accounts to show what is it that you're doing.

01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:05.100
On your PlayStation will show on your discord profile.

01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:07.020
Maybe you don't want people to know that's okay.

01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:08.140
Cause you can hide that too.

01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:12.860
By the way, this functionality has existed for Xbox and the market for, for a little

01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:18.460
while now, but it's nice that Sony is there too, especially because we heard like a while

01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:22.540
ago that Sony and discord were doing like a strategic partnership kind of thing.

01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:27.820
So I feel like this is weird that it took this long to get here, but okay.

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.540
Anyway, the pop-up has come up for a lot of people.

01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:35.020
So you probably saw it that way, but if you missed it, go to the discord app on your web,

01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:40.860
on the web browser or mobile, whatever, go to the connections section of the user settings.

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:44.940
And then where all the other connected accounts are, cause you can connect your Twitch

01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:47.980
and all that stuff, uh, connect your PSN account there.

01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:49.660
Uh, and, uh, there you go.

01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:56.940
So, uh, we'll see what else comes out of that partnership that they formed back in May,

01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:59.340
um, in the coming months.

01:56:59.340 --> 01:56:59.840
Interesting.

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:03.500
Especially because do you remember this?

01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:07.340
Remember at one point, Microsoft was going to buy discord and then that didn't happen.

01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:07.900
You remember that?

01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:10.060
That was only about a year ago that'll happen.

01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:12.140
Uh, they were going to buy them for 10 billion.

01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:15.100
Um, but discord is staying an independent company.

01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:15.900
So interesting.

01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:22.300
Discord in a blog post said we are excited to continue our partnership with PlayStation

01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:27.420
and explore how we can collectively create great shared experiences for your friends

01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:28.380
and communities.

01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:30.060
We'll see what develops.

01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:32.940
All right.

01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:33.580
Anyway.

01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:34.620
Uh, Oh, that's it.

01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:40.940
We're now to the listener round table where we invite your calls over at vognetwork.com

01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:41.900
slash discord.

01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:43.740
So there's another plug for that.

01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:47.660
Uh, you can join the green room and we will get to some calls if anybody decides to be

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:48.940
brave enough to call in.

01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:55.500
We also like to do emails, although I can't recall if I saw any, um, participate at orange

01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:56.940
lounge radio.com.

01:57:56.940 --> 01:57:58.380
No, no.

01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:02.860
So usually this would be the place where dark soccer and I talk about drag race, but admittedly

01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:04.220
I haven't been watching.

01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:06.220
So remind me of this case.

01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:11.100
I guess it'd be a good place to really talk about that Kickstarter that, uh, about drag

01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.060
her or whatever it was called.

01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:14.300
It looked pretty fun.

01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:21.260
I mean, the, the rewards on there though were, I mean, some of them got to be pretty big.

01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:27.100
Like if you spent like five grand that flight, you had to provide your own ticket, but they'd

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:31.820
go to Los Angeles and participate in all this stuff and whatever.

01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:35.500
And I'm like, that doesn't sound like it would happen.

01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:41.820
Um, but I just, I just got the one to get my copy of the game.

01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:44.780
Um, it looks, it looks like fun.

01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:50.380
I mean, I wonder if you're going to have like the shade attack or the reading attack or

01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:50.780
something.

01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:57.500
Probably just a bunch of isms ripped off from drag race, which in turn was ripped off from

01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:58.380
Paris is burning.

01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:02.380
And, you know, it's just been, you know, it, it looks interesting though.

01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:03.820
I mean, I think it's going to be fun.

01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:04.220
Oh yeah.

01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:05.660
It'll be, it'll be cute.

01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:07.500
So yeah, I'll check it out.

01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:13.580
If it, if it ends up being, you know, actually something that, uh, that does reach its funding.

01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:17.740
I do have one thing I'll say about drag race.

01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:21.020
And again, we talked drag race because we didn't get any emails participate at orange

01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:21.980
launch radio.com.

01:59:21.980 --> 01:59:26.060
So when we don't get emails, we assume the email says, tell us your thoughts on drag

01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:26.860
race.

01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:33.740
Now I haven't really been watching either series, but I will say this about UK versus

01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:34.300
the world.

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:35.740
That one that's airing right now.

01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:37.020
I'm going to say this about that.

01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:44.060
I done told you years ago, pangina heels is fucking hot.

01:59:44.060 --> 01:59:45.100
Number one.

01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:46.220
And it's fucking talented.

01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:50.700
Number two, I done said that on that podcast I used to do with, uh, captain spike and slide

01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:51.420
kick and Delvin.

01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:54.860
We had that show for a while and that was right when Thailand season one came out.

01:59:54.860 --> 02:00:00.140
And I told you then hot, talented.

02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:04.940
And now, now y'all learning that watching UK versus the world there, there, there is

02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:06.460
no other queen than pangina heels.

02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:11.420
In my opinion, she's already been told, I already told you, I already told, I'm glad

02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:12.700
the rest of you caught up.

02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:17.580
Finally, I, in all reality, I'm actually thrilled that pangina heels gets a spotlight

02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:22.220
on this because, you know, unfortunately with drag race, Thailand, not being in English,

02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:25.980
let's, you know, be, I mean, it was great for people in that country, but people in

02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:31.180
us, Britain, Canada, couldn't really experience or get to know pangina heels.

02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:35.420
So I'm really glad that she has this platform for people to be able to get to know her.

02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:37.260
So I'm very glad about that.

02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:37.580
All right.

02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:38.860
Yeah, there you go.

02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:39.580
That's it.

02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:40.140
Okay.

02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:40.780
Straight man.

02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:42.300
One more thing.

02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:43.100
What?

02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:49.180
The, uh, it's like something like a, uh, Twitch, uh, LGBT award that's going on.

02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:49.660
Oh yeah.

02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:50.140
I heard about it.

02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:50.940
We weren't nominated.

02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:51.500
How about that?

02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:59.900
Well, Evo though, who is, uh, a drag queen, uh, Dead by Daylight streamer has been nominated

02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:02.380
and was just recently, uh, named a Twitch ambassador.

02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:05.580
I saw, um, I lurk in her channel sometimes.

02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:07.420
She doesn't even know who I am, but I lurk in her channel sometimes.

02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:09.100
Holly got nominated for something with that?

02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:11.820
Uh, yeah, it's me, Holly.

02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:12.320
Yeah.

02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:16.700
I didn't see Holly on the, uh, there's two categories.

02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:18.220
One is like big streamer.

02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:21.180
One is like up and coming streamer and she's on the up and coming one.

02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:21.740
Yeah.

02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:22.240
Yeah.

02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:23.740
Holly's great.

02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:29.500
I really enjoy Holly's, um, Holly's streams, but I'll be honest.

02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:32.700
The person I've been spending a lot more time in lately, um, you know,

02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:35.260
apart from my usuals is, uh, the lady bird.

02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:36.640
Okay.

02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:38.860
Really, really fun.

02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:45.420
I actually got her husband as a survivor in Dead by Daylight once.

02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:46.140
It was pretty funny.

02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:49.260
I was like, wait, are you who I think you are?

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:50.460
It's like, are you dark Sakura?

02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:52.220
I'm like, yeah, it was pretty funny.

02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:52.720
That's funny.

02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:54.220
Um, okay.

02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:59.100
So of course we open up this segment as well to, uh, your questions in discord.

02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:01.100
And, uh, there's a couple of questions coming in here.

02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:05.500
So let's start with Bobby Blackwell's question who says, is Dan getting a rush pinball yet?

02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:08.540
He didn't think it looked that exciting.

02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:14.860
I want it for the music, but honestly it, it didn't have a lot of the fun twists that

02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:15.980
some of the other pinballs do.

02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:17.840
All right.

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:22.540
It's, it's kind of middle of the road as far as a pinball goes,

02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:25.340
but I still want it for the music and the theme.

02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:25.840
Yeah.

02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:29.180
Um, as the show under Matt says, what's everyone's streaming?

02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:32.380
I was watching murderville this week, which has been hilarious.

02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:37.900
Uh, so not, not streaming games, but like other, I guess, media, uh, TV movie type of thing.

02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:43.180
The book of Boba Fett or AKA the Mandalorian part two.

02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:50.540
Um, I don't watch a lot of TV, but I have been watching Australian survivor, um, who I think,

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:53.340
and I know people have very strong opinions on survivor.

02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:54.700
They either love it or they hate it.

02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:55.500
And I get it.

02:02:55.500 --> 02:03:00.540
But, um, I will say this Australia is producing a better show right now than the U S like I am

02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:02.700
so sold on Australia's survivor.

02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:03.980
It's so good.

02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:08.380
Uh, and this particular season has, uh, and I am a Sandra fan boy.

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.220
I think she, she is the queen.

02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:14.620
And the fact that the fact that they got her to do the Australia version, I think is huge.

02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:17.500
And I just, I just love watching her and her daughter play in the,

02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:19.340
the rest of the cast is really good too.

02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:21.500
So props to a Australian survivor.

02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:26.220
That's what I've been streaming, quote unquote streaming, but secretly,

02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:32.380
it's a secret group online that has links to pirate the episodes because paramount plus

02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:37.660
teased us with adding Australian survivor, but won't do it day and date as it's airing live.

02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:40.380
And the show like survivor gets spoiled very easy.

02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:42.300
So as far as I'm concerned, that's paramount.

02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:43.180
Plus is lost.

02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:44.220
Yes, I will pirate it.

02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:47.180
Uh, I would have, I would have happily watched it on your platform.

02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:49.420
Paramount plus get with, get with the times.

02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:52.140
We live in a world environment.

02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:55.500
I don't know why, uh, Loki, what are you streaming?

02:03:55.900 --> 02:04:00.460
Um, King of the Hill.

02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:04.160
Why not?

02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:07.340
Hey, streaming is to watch old stuff too.

02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:07.840
Why not?

02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:09.260
All right.

02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:11.980
It's either King of the Hill or a Barefoot Contessa.

02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:15.980
Why not both at the same time?

02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:22.540
Um, Dartitsuya says maybe a long shot, but has anyone checked out the Cotton reboot?

02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:25.900
The wife got it for me and it's the cutest shmup I've ever played.

02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:27.820
I've really been meaning to check it out.

02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:30.700
I haven't yet, but it looks super cute.

02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:33.820
Uh, and I'm sure dark soccer has just now been reminded of it and it's like,

02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:34.700
I should probably get that.

02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:36.060
I have it.

02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:36.620
Oh, you do?

02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:37.500
Oh, what do you think?

02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:39.180
Yeah, it was gifted to me.

02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:40.940
Oh, love that.

02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:44.220
So, um, I haven't played it yet though.

02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:44.720
Nope.

02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:45.600
Get on it.

02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:53.200
Um, Cotton requires a certain amount of attention that I've been sorely lacking lately.

02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:54.560
I understand.

02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:01.200
Uh, ZenMonkey11 says, uh, they're streaming Big Brother, which I got to, usually I'm into

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:07.120
those, but the cast, the cast was so unexciting this year.

02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:07.620
Sorry.

02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:10.800
I just, I'm not interested in anyone on the cast.

02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:13.200
Sorry about it.

02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:19.440
Um, Sia Tiberius suggests the Barefoot King of the Hill or Contessa of the Hill.

02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:20.800
I like Barefoot King of the Hill.

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:24.320
Uh, DJ Rama S says King of the Hill is a great anime.

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:24.800
Yes.

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:26.080
King of the Hills of Tatooine.

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:29.360
All right.

02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:32.240
Uh, Loki, do we have any last minute stories tonight?

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:33.620
No.

02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:34.660
No.

02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:35.840
All right.

02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:37.280
Let's, let's see what I'm talking about.

02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:40.400
I think someone robbing a bank with a Sonic the Hedgehog mask on.

02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:41.600
That's not gaming news.

02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:43.120
That's not gaming news.

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:43.680
That's not gaming.

02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:44.720
That's a filler piece.

02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:51.040
I, and I actually, actually, you know, I will say for a minute, I, I think gaming websites

02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:57.440
and news websites that run with those types of headlines should really stop and evaluate

02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:01.680
what is, what is the point of running with that type of headline?

02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:07.600
Or like a story that like is like talking about a YouTube video, like a singular YouTube

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:07.920
video.

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:11.680
Like I watched a, like, for example, there was one, I saw that they talked about Doug

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:16.000
Doug's video where he does like silly challenges on Twitch all the time.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:21.600
And one of them was like, he's going to play, um, he's going to speed run Mario Odyssey.

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:27.280
And every five minutes, he's going to add a HUD from a different game just to his OBS.

02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:29.520
And he has to like, look through all that.

02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:32.720
And it's just silly, but they wrote an article about that.

02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:39.120
But I, I just think in particular, the whole, like, Oh, this thing happened in the real

02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:39.600
world.

02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:43.760
And it just like had this very loose tie to gaming culture.

02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:46.800
I mean, gaming culture is like everywhere now.

02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:52.960
It's like the whole thing with Mario Kart, like anyone in their forties or younger grew

02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:58.160
up with Mario Kart and knows what Mario Kart is and played it at a birthday party at least

02:06:58.160 --> 02:06:59.600
once in their life.

02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:05.360
Unless, I mean, you live in a very rural and or, you know, I guess in North America, you

02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:08.800
know, I realized the world's a big place, but you know what I mean?

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:11.200
Like people know that type of stuff.

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:14.720
So it's like somebody robbed a bank with a Sonic the Hedgehog mat.

02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:18.320
Well, big like people rob a bank with Mickey Mouse masks on.

02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:20.720
You don't see deadline reporting on that.

02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:28.320
Like, it's just, I just don't, I don't understand what that absolutely has to do with gaming.

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:35.280
I feel like blogs and news sites try to say, Oh, look, it's like, it's proof that gaming

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:37.280
is out there in pop co okay.

02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.080
We've been new.

02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.880
Like we know, we know gaming is out there in pop culture.

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:47.440
Like, you don't, especially these negative things like robbing a bank, we don't need

02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:48.320
it pointed out.

02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:52.000
Sonic the Hedgehog gamers, they're just robbing banks.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.720
Now it's probably that grand theft auto teaching them to do that.

02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:58.720
Sonic the Hedgehog fast.

02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:05.440
Sonic the Hedgehog was a highly successful movie franchise at this point and that franchise

02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:07.440
cause they're doing more than one movie.

02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:09.920
Like that is worth writing about.

02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:12.960
Do we need to talk about Sonic robbing a fucking bank?

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:14.080
I don't think so.

02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:14.880
It's just silly.

02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:19.920
Uh, and Bobby in chat says, uh, yeah, they still have story quotas at Kotaku.

02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:23.360
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, it's usually a Kotaku writer fulfilling a story quota for

02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:23.920
the week.

02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:28.400
Uh, yes, it's easy to pick on them, but I see a lot of other places too.

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.640
So sure we can start the conversation with Kotaku, but this is a problem all throughout

02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:33.200
the industry.

02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:33.840
Let's be real.

02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:35.520
Those types of like report.

02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:36.720
Cause, cause guess what?

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:38.960
Kotaku ran with that headline.

02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:42.560
I'll bet you what there's, there's what?

02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:46.000
Probably hundreds of active gaming podcasts right now.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.000
I'll bet you at least a hundred of those gaming podcasts picked up that headline from Kotaku

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
and they're going to talk about the bank robbery with the song.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
I guess we just did, but in a different context are going to talk about the article on the

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:56.720
show.

02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:00.800
And my, my point is why that has nothing to do with gaming.

02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:06.320
And I just think we need to, we just need to get above that.

02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:07.920
It's just silly.

02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:13.760
Uh, Zen monkey in chat says Mario and Sonic do a heist is the next switch game.

02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:16.320
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says grand theft Mario.

02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.840
See now you bitches are funny.

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:21.600
Like if people are going to bring it up to be funny like that, then that's different.

02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:24.960
But you know, you know that, you know, the difference, you know.

02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:31.840
Anyway, let's just, let's just stop talking about the, it's, it's, it's, and honestly,

02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:37.520
it's along the same lines to me as, and this was what, just like three, four years ago,

02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:39.040
we would have those headlines.

02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:48.080
Uh, woman meets underage man on world of Warcraft and kidnaps him across state lines for like,

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:50.960
cause I know that was a thing a couple of years ago.

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:58.320
And it's just like, is, is that really about world of Warcraft or is that just about weird

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:00.880
people doing weird things and illegal things?

02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:04.080
It's not about gaming culture.

02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:12.080
It's just gaming is that much in our culture that now all the ugly shit in our culture,

02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:15.360
like kidnapping, like robbing banks, et cetera, et cetera.

02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:20.160
Is now, you know, gaming gets tied into that stuff.

02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:26.800
Uh, pixel pockets and chat says reminds me of that headline this week.

02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:30.640
Here's the boat that won't bring Jeff Bezos hair or wife back.

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:32.400
And I was like, that's Savage.

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:33.140
Wow.

02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:36.800
When that's the head seat, but that's funny.

02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:43.680
Like again, if like, we're all going to be less irritated if it's funny.

02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:49.760
If the headline on Kotaku had been Mario and Sonic do a heist or whatever,

02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:52.960
I probably would have never brought it up here on OLR because I would have been,

02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:54.480
well bitch, at least it was funny.

02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:55.540
Right.

02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:58.100
Anyway.

02:10:58.260 --> 02:10:58.760
Anyway.

02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:02.100
Yeah.

02:11:02.100 --> 02:11:05.380
E3VL says clickbait titles for sure, for sure.

02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:07.940
And then Facebook threatens to pull out of Europe and I'm like,

02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:11.140
why don't you just do the entirety of Europe a gigantic favor?

02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:15.220
They won't ever have to see another clickbait headline.

02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:20.840
Let's see.

02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:21.860
Oh yeah.

02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:25.620
SJ100 Matt brings up the whole Kotaku story about magfest,

02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:29.380
where they claimed magfest refused to respond to the story.

02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:32.180
Magfest showed the receipts that said otherwise.

02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:37.060
Yeah, because they gave magfest like an hour to respond before they ran with the story.

02:11:37.060 --> 02:11:42.100
And then of course they put magfest did not comment on this by a deadline time.

02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:46.180
And it's like, girl, that's shady.

02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:47.940
That's shady.

02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:51.300
You need to give a company like magfest more than an hour to respond.

02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:51.800
Come on.

02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:52.920
Come on.

02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:56.040
Most companies when they get any kind of correspondence

02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:59.480
or contact are at minimum 24 hours to reply.

02:11:59.480 --> 02:11:59.980
Yeah.

02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:04.520
I just, and I'm not, I'm not here trying to drag the entirety of games journalism.

02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:07.560
I'm just trying to point out, these are things we can probably do better.

02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:12.280
These are, these are things that do, do we really need this in our, you know,

02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:15.080
if we're, if we're gaming fans and this is gaming fandom,

02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:18.360
do we need bank robbers in this discussion?

02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:19.160
I don't think so.

02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:22.360
Do we need NFTs in this discussion?

02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:27.480
That's a fucking lutely not, but at least I understand why that's coming up because it's

02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:32.360
in that context, it's bringing an awareness to these things that gaming executives are.

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:36.360
We think that, you know, they're, they're being convinced and your favorite Hollywood

02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:41.400
celebrities like Brie Larson, Tony Hawk are getting pulled into a conference room

02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:45.080
and getting convinced by some shill that this is the next big thing.

02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:46.440
And they have to get in on it.

02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:46.940
Right.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.360
And they have to write a tweet about it.

02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:49.740
Anyway.

02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:53.580
Okay, I'm off my soapbox.

02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:54.940
That's what you get when you don't email us.

02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:57.100
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:12:58.140 --> 02:13:00.380
That being said, we'll wrap up.

02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:05.260
We'll run into everybody's final thoughts, but first I want to thank you as always for

02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:08.540
listening to our show, whether you are here live with us on Sunday nights,

02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:11.340
or you were listening via the podcast feed on your favorite app.

02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:13.980
Thank you so much for doing that.

02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:19.660
And hey, either leave us a nice review, please, or tell a friend about the show.

02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:22.540
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice and we

02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:27.100
want more voices in the room so we can talk constructively about the things going on in

02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:29.260
our industry and not about bank robbers.

02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:32.300
We'll be back next week, of course.

02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:37.340
And then not here in two weeks as the show goes through some changes with the relocation,

02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:42.300
but it'll still be the same old good old OLR that you know and love.

02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:46.940
But I hope you will join us next week despite the concert bookended by that little ball

02:13:46.940 --> 02:13:47.900
game on TV.

02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:50.780
I think that's it.

02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:51.980
Dark Sakura.

02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:53.900
What is your final thought tonight?

02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:02.060
Keep your salty shit about no way out of my end game chat.

02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:03.980
All right.

02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:05.180
Have fun and Debbie delight.

02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:06.220
We'll see you in a little bit.

02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:06.540
All right.

02:14:07.180 --> 02:14:08.460
Why is Debbie so delightful?

02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:11.420
She's kind of a bitch lately because she because she did Dallas.

02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:15.500
And she's sore now.

02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:16.300
Bye bye.

02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:19.180
All right.

02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:20.060
Loki, we'll go to you.

02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:20.780
Your final thought.

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:25.260
Final thought is I need to work more on Minecraft.

02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:27.180
I need to figure out some different things to do in there.

02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:33.020
So, um, my final thought is I'll probably do like one personal stream this week, but

02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:35.180
then I'm going to be on a little bit of a break because of the move.

02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:36.540
I'm sure y'all can understand.

02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:40.780
But yeah, I'm really excited to getting to a new place in a new setup.

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:46.860
S200 Matt, I think a good thought here too says mask up, get vaxxed and boosted, stay

02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:47.820
home when you're sick.

02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:49.020
Right, Loki?

02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:50.380
You're staying home because you're sick.

02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:50.880
Right.

02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:51.980
Yeah.

02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:53.260
On a serious note, feel better.

02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:56.860
I'm sorry that happened, but I hope it's, it sounds like, has it been, it hasn't been

02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:57.740
that bad, right?

02:14:57.740 --> 02:14:59.100
Cause you, you got vaxxed and boosted.

02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:03.660
So it's just been, yeah, it's been, I mean, it's been like a, just like a cold.

02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:06.540
I mean, I don't know, like, but right now I just have that.

02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:08.940
I mean, like the cough and phlegm phase.

02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:10.860
So I understand.

02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:16.060
I was wondering if I, you know, I've just had this most sore throat for like an entire

02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:17.980
week and then that was it.

02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:19.100
This is weird.

02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:19.980
I don't know.

02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:20.620
Maybe it's nothing.

02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:21.760
All right.

02:15:22.780 --> 02:15:24.460
That's I did take an at home test actually.

02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:26.220
And it was negative, but I know those at home tests.

02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:27.660
Well, here's the funny thing too.

02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:30.380
I took an at home test too, and it was also negative.

02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:33.500
And then you took the lab test and it was positive.

02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:37.980
Um, well, my son took a test at school cause he had gotten a cold.

02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:40.140
So we thought, Oh, he just had what I had.

02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:42.700
And then he got some symptoms.

02:15:42.700 --> 02:15:47.500
So he, we kept him up for a day or two just to, you know, until his fever went down.

02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:50.860
And then he got back to school and he had to take a test there before they let him in.

02:15:50.860 --> 02:15:52.780
They're like, it's positive.

02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:54.300
I'm like, uh, dang it.

02:15:55.820 --> 02:15:55.980
Yeah.

02:15:55.980 --> 02:16:02.620
But the one, the ones that like, dang it, the one, the actual, the tests actually at

02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:05.900
like the hospitals aren't as good as the at home test.

02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:11.020
Cause the ones that the hospitals will detect it up to like 90 days after it's been in your

02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:11.900
system.

02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:15.820
So like, it's not a good indicator whether you have COVID still.

02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:20.140
Um, it's just, if you've had it recently, um, but the at home tests, at least that's

02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:23.020
those pediatricians that said the at home tests are the way to go.

02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:25.740
I don't know, but we'll see.

02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:25.980
All right.

02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:27.660
Well stay safe everyone.

02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:32.540
I mean, it does seem like it sucks Loki that we're at the, at this finish line basically

02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:36.860
when it comes to Omicron and things are going down and lucky you, here you are.

02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:41.100
But hopefully, hopefully this is a sign of the, the, the thing.

02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:45.020
Cause the, you know, the long-term stuff isn't a big deal.

02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:45.340
Yeah.

02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:45.580
Yeah.

02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:47.100
Here's hoping fingers and toes crossed.

02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:47.900
All right.

02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:48.620
That's it everyone.

02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:51.340
We'll be back in seven days for episode 903.

02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:52.300
Happy gaming everyone.

02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:53.020
Have a great week.

02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:53.740
We'll see you next time.

02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:56.460
Hey, next week we get to celebrate one year of Pixel Poops.

02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:57.980
So tune in next week for that.

02:16:57.980 --> 02:16:59.740
The actual one year anniversary.

02:16:59.740 --> 02:17:00.620
Uh, good night everybody.

02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:01.500
We'll see you next time.

02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:02.220
Uh, have a good one.

02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:03.900
Oops.

02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:10.140
Maybe it would help if I hit the right button that says credits and not classic game B roll.

02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:11.260
Let's try that again.

02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:12.140
Good night everybody.

02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:15.660
