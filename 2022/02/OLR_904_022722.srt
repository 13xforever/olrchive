1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,200
The software publisher Laundry Landscape has been flowing for years.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
God Galaxy, Epic Games Store, Battle.net, a few among the many.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
The landscape is ebbing just a touch with Bethesda choosing to close up their direct

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,160
storefront shop and move their library back to Steam.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,520
Consolidation in action, business in motion, time ticks on.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,520
P.S.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,520
Fuck war.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,720
This is my standout story.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,040
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,960
this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where Every

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Gamer Has a Voice

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,840
where Every Gamer Has a Voice.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:58,840
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again for episode number 904 of our show.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,120
For tonight, February the 27th of 2022.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,820
My name is Rob Roberts.

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,960
Do not adjust your TV sets over here at Twitch.tv.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,280
Yes, it looks different tonight because as we've been hyping up on the show for the last

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,120
few weeks, I've moved.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,520
I'm in a brand new location and yeah, we just did a minor facelift on some things to accommodate

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,720
for that.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,400
At the same bandwidth, same token, some things might be off that they were before.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,720
I'm understanding my audio might be a little bit echoey.

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,000
I've got some things to kind of fix there.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,040
This room is not quite set up completely the way I want it to for the future, but please

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,640
bear with us while we work through some of the kinks.

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,860
Literally was working on the show up until 15 minutes before we went live tonight.

28
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,960
So there probably will be some things that go wrong as we get used to broadcasting here

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,960
from studio number 8 for the show or as I've been calling it studio infinity because as

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,720
you know, it's in a virtual environment, so the space is limitless.

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
And joining me-

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
So it's not studio Sense8?

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Yes.

34
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,080
Say hello, hello Dark Sakura as she is always here.

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
No, it is not studio Sense8.

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,080
That was canceled, unfortunately, by Netflix.

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
And it lives on through us.

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Wait.

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
That's right.

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
That's right.

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,280
It does in a way, or at least it lives on in the Wachowski universe because I believe

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,520
a lot of those folks that were acting in that were in the Matrix movie, which I never did

43
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
see.

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
I was-

45
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
I need to see the new one.

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,560
And of course, we do tape live still as we do every week over at the Voice Geeks Network

47
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,320
twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,000
Black Wolf show.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,040
And it was nice to have both of our shows on this week because last week we were off

50
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,360
two weeks ago, Bobby was off.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,440
So we were both here tonight.

52
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,720
And I see you all in chat.

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Hello, hello.

54
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,880
Pod Culture saying Sense8 was great.

55
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Had one of my faves in it.

56
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
I love Sense8 too.

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,140
It was a great show.

58
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,840
I didn't watch the movie.

59
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,840
I still have to get caught up on that.

60
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,440
I will at some point.

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,000
Also joining us as he does every week.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hello.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hi, Loki.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How are you?

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm fine.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Good.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Did you ever watch Sense8?

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Were you a fan of that?

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I didn't watch it.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, I actually never watched it either.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm just saying.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What?

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What?

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All right.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,760
If they're already made, you should check it out.

78
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,240
I did at least watch like the first season.

79
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm pretty sure I saw the second season too.

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,600
It's pretty good.

81
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,000
If you guys do notice like, oh my gosh, the audio is like way off or something, please

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
feel free to holler and chat and I'll do my best to fix it as we go live.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,760
But this is very much a screw it.

84
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,000
We'll do it live tonight because yeah, again, I just got settled into this space not even

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,240
a week ago and like got everything set up for OLR just in the past few days.

86
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,680
And today I've been very busy.

87
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,640
It's not just been unpacking with this new place, but it's been trying to get the old

88
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,320
place settled and taken care of as well.

89
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,840
And we purged a lot of shit at the old place.

90
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,600
And yeah, so there's that as well.

91
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,880
So pop culture says you got to dial it in and that takes time.

92
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Well, thank you.

93
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Thank you for understanding.

94
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
Appreciate that.

95
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
That is for sure.

96
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,360
We'll try to figure out.

97
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Yeah.

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
All the fun stuff going on.

99
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
I expect immediate perfection.

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Do you?

101
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
No.

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
From us, no.

103
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Yeah, I know.

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,520
It's, it's, it's going to always be a little, a little weird.

105
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,280
That's just a, that's just the way it is here at a OLR.

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
Yeah.

107
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,800
They're saying that I sound distant, which I wonder if I'm not coming through the webcam,

108
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,680
but I'm supposed to in fact be coming through this mic that's sitting here.

109
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,800
I wonder if somehow that didn't get screwed up at some point, which is certainly, it's

110
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,300
certainly possible.

111
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
That's for sure.

112
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,300
But we'll see.

113
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
Oh, we'll see.

114
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,300
It says mic default.

115
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,320
Maybe if I, maybe if I do that, don't put it as default, just make the

116
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
selection.

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,240
I wonder, that's trusting windows and you can never trust windows.

118
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,960
Did that change anything?

119
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
I just did.

120
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Maybe.

121
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Not really.

122
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Oh, dammit.

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
I thought that might be it.

124
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
All right.

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Well, that's something I'll have to take a look at a little bit later.

126
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
So sorry if I sound a little weird.

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,640
Uh, I am using, I would say the weird thing is I'm using the same mic, the wave three

128
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,000
that I use for streaming, or at least I'm supposed to be, which sounds really nice when

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm streaming.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
So, um, yeah, I don't know what's going on.

131
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,080
So, um, if worse comes to worse, I still have the old mixing board and mic and I can always

132
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,600
get that all set up again.

133
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,920
Um, and maybe that's just what I'll end up doing.

134
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
We'll see.

135
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,880
It's, it's a learning experience here in our new studio, but do y'all like my, do y'all

136
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,600
like my burger time machine that you see behind me here on Twitch?

137
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,520
I'm noticing there's a little bit of a space next to it as well, that a nice little something

138
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,920
something could fit over here.

139
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,040
But what I also don't have set up is I have a ton of amiibo figures and other little things

140
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,400
and trinkets that I want, um, that I want to be using.

141
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800
And I want that to all be set up as well.

142
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,320
And uh, yeah, so there's also what you guys don't see just off frame.

143
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,840
There's a walk-in closet and I've actually thought about having the arcade machines in

144
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,060
the walk-in closet.

145
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,080
So it's actually like a little walk-in arcade.

146
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,800
Um, that might be kind of fun.

147
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
We'll see.

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
We'll see.

149
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
There's still a lot of things to decide.

150
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,280
Anyway, we're going to get into the news, uh, as we do here, let's get into our kickoff

151
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
topic tonight.

152
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,240
Uh, a very big, uh, direct that happened this morning, right?

153
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Uh, Loki, maybe you want to start us off here.

154
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Yes.

155
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,480
It's a Pokemon themed.

156
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
I don't know.

157
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,920
Was it a direct or was it just like some other thing?

158
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I don't think it was a direct.

159
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,040
It was like, well, today is actually the anniversary of Pokemon.

160
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,680
So today is like the anniversary of the games releasing, uh, the original red and green,

161
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,920
uh, in Japan.

162
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,280
And so, uh, they usually try to do a little something today.

163
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,360
So it was like Pokemon, Pokemon day celebration, if you will.

164
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,360
Uh, Mike Deaf says it's Pokemon presents was the actual name of it.

165
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Uh, yeah.

166
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Pokemon presents?

167
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Sign me up.

168
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Pretty much.

169
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Yeah.

170
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,280
So they had a big announcement, well, lots of announcements actually.

171
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,380
So kind of going down the list here, uh, the biggest one obviously is new mainline entry.

172
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:02,060
So Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which are coming to Nintendo switch later this year to which

173
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,820
those trailers look pretty cool.

174
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,180
It looks open world.

175
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,180
It looks like Pokemon ArcSIS.

176
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,740
Did we have the B team working on the art for ArcSIS because this looks a lot better

177
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
than that.

178
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:20,940
And if you compare contrast to the game that just came out and it's like, eh, all those

179
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,820
complaints that people were saying about the art style, yeah, kind of valid.

180
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Um, so that's coming out and of course the three starters that they have for that as

181
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,820
well.

182
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,100
Um, which one looks kind of like Donald Duck.

183
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:40,700
And then, uh, we've got a, it looks like now I'm assuming that this, are they all of

184
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,920
the Alolan Pokemon, but apparently Pokemon goes getting Alolan Pokemon March 1st.

185
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:51,300
We've already had some Alolan Pokemon as part of different events, but, uh, apparently we're

186
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,580
going to be getting more of them or all of them.

187
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,060
I don't know.

188
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,620
So that's coming very soon.

189
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,540
Pokemon Go tends to run things or roll things out like slowly.

190
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,300
Um, so when they say Alolan Pokemon are coming to Pokemon Go, it'll probably be like the

191
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,940
starters and, uh, maybe some of the, like, really like S or not S tier, but like F tier

192
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,180
kind of Pokemon in that game, you know, the normal types in the first area, uh, that'll

193
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,200
come through, uh, probably won't be a lot.

194
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,980
And then they'll release more throughout the year if it goes by, by like, um, the, the,

195
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,300
uh, like gen five and six and all that did.

196
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
Yeah.

197
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:36,580
Uh, apparently the mobile Pokemon game, um, so I'm assuming they're talking about Pokemon

198
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
Go.

199
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,180
Maybe, um, they're saying the Pokemon Dex is expanded to include gen seven editions

200
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,140
from sun and moon.

201
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:52,700
Um, Pokemon masters, ex ads, victory road and Pokemon cafe remix.

202
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,740
It gets a delivery feature as well.

203
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,540
All these games, I have no idea what they are.

204
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,180
Um, what else?

205
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:06,220
Uh, Pokemon unite is getting a mayhem mode and let's see brilliant diamond and shining

206
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,460
Pearl are getting shaman.

207
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,200
And I think Arxis had some updates as well.

208
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,900
There's supposed to be a 1.1 version cats or K whatever.

209
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
I don't care.

210
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Arxis it Arceus.

211
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,420
I don't know how you pronounce it.

212
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,340
I don't care because they cut corners on their art.

213
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,300
So I'm going to cut corners on the pronunciation.

214
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,180
You can use a code, I guess, to get some free balls in the game.

215
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,980
So our case, Arxis adventure, whatever, however you want to pronounce that, um, if you use

216
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:45,940
that by March 31st, you get some free pokey balls and they're getting an anime adaptation

217
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,380
of it as well.

218
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,900
And I saw there was like actual DLC or something, but maybe not, maybe it's a bit early for

219
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
that.

220
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,700
There's just that patch, which it wasn't clear to me what all is in the patch.

221
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,900
I think it sounds like they're doing, um, like from what I was picking up, like some

222
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,300
of those, um, the, the encounters in the wild where like a ton of them show up, which I

223
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,780
can't remember the name of in the moment.

224
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:15,180
Um, but there was a whole quest line that I think will show more of those, that more

225
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,280
of those will show up.

226
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,140
So it wasn't DLC, but it's more like, just like a patch basically.

227
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,240
That's going to put more content in the game, massive mass outbreaks.

228
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,780
That's what Mike Deaf says in the chat, uh, outbreaks of alpha Pokemon.

229
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,140
I don't remember that being in the main game and I caught that that was in the trailer.

230
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,100
So I was like, Oh, that was scary.

231
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Yeah.

232
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,060
And then, um, Pokemon sleep, um, nothing like that.

233
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,820
Pokemon sleep forever.

234
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Yeah.

235
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,980
Uh, Mike Deaf says you get multiple outbreaks now instead of one.

236
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Oh, that's good.

237
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,220
Cause the outbreaks are a really good way to catch shinies.

238
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,940
I know that's like the preferred shiny hunting method at this point.

239
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,060
You kind of combine that with having a really complete pokey decks and I think the shiny

240
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,220
charm and you put all that together and it makes the shinies like a lot more obtainable

241
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,220
than they were before.

242
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
So yeah.

243
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,740
So yeah, basically what they've done with the new update is they're modeling the outbreaks

244
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,300
of Pokemon based on COVID-19 outbreaks.

245
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,860
And so you'll see a lot more, a lot, a lot more Pokemon now because of that.

246
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
I see.

247
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,860
I see.

248
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,860
And it'll fade pretty quick, hopefully.

249
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,860
Yes.

250
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,860
It'll fade pretty quick.

251
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,100
It'll come out and everybody will forget our arcades didn't exist.

252
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:31,420
For a little while you'll lose your taste and play like bad Pokemon games.

253
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,900
You'll lose your taste for Pokemon and go play Elden Ring for a little while, which

254
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,460
is what it seems like everybody is doing this week.

255
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,080
I have zero interest in that game.

256
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,100
Everybody fucking dropped what they were doing to go play Elden Ring.

257
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Yeah.

258
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Here's the thing.

259
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,400
I'm not super big on Souls games.

260
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,460
I'm not big on George R.R. Martin.

261
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,440
I'm not here to yuck somebody's yum.

262
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,480
My husband loves those soul games, so I'm excited for him.

263
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,440
I've watched people streaming the game.

264
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
I get it.

265
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,800
It's just one of those things where I'm like, I just, I got other stuff I need to play right

266
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
now.

267
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,480
I won't piss in y'all's cornflakes, but I'll go eat some Froot Loops.

268
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,320
That that part.

269
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Exactly that.

270
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
All right.

271
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
So, yeah.

272
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,520
So that was a nice little, again, Gen 9.

273
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,740
I was not expecting that whatsoever for that to come out.

274
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,740
And this year.

275
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,260
I thought like this would have been the Pokemon game of the year and that'd be it.

276
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,420
I would, especially with everything else on the Switch, having getting been pushed back,

277
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,260
I am shocked really that we are getting a new mainline Pokemon game this year.

278
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
That is for sure.

279
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,060
So, yeah, that is cool.

280
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,300
I'm really excited to play that at some point.

281
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,300
So let's see.

282
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,700
Dartisia in chat says, oh, my wife got Elden Ring.

283
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,740
I think she's digging it.

284
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,340
I might try it, although I'm knee deep in my second Cyberpunk playthrough.

285
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,580
Let's see.

286
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,500
Fifth Dream says, I've been watching an Australian lady catch all the shinies, then all the alpha

287
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
shinies.

288
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Oh, my God.

289
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,620
That sounds like a nightmare to do that, too.

290
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,620
She's amazing.

291
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,620
Awesome.

292
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,580
Hey, that's like Elden Ring.

293
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,340
I watch people play it and it's fun, but I just don't think the you died, you died, you

294
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,740
died, you died is for me.

295
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,740
I've tried it.

296
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,060
I tried to play the original Demon's Souls.

297
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,460
I tried to play Dark Souls, I think, or one of the other ones.

298
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,820
I tried to play Bloodborne.

299
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,340
I just wasn't feeling it.

300
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,340
Sorry.

301
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,740
Mike Deft in chat says, the new games may be based on Spain or at least in the Mediterranean

302
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Sea area.

303
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,100
Yeah, they haven't said for sure, but the name of one of the Pokémon to me kind of

304
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,780
sounded like, oh, I wonder if that isn't like influenced, like with Spain or something was

305
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,820
kind of interesting.

306
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,420
Which did you guys see the new starter type Pokémon?

307
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,940
I was curious what you guys thought of that.

308
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,500
I didn't bother.

309
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,900
Oh, look them up.

310
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,300
I like the Weed Cat.

311
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,260
There's Weed Kitty, there's Applegator and there's Emoduck.

312
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,740
Emod.

313
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,860
That's what I'm calling him anyway.

314
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,020
Mike Deft says, Springatito and Fuecoco.

315
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,140
Now see, that sounds like what Dark Sakura might actually name a pet, except it would

316
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,940
be FuegoGo, not Fuecoco.

317
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,940
But it's really close.

318
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,140
DJ RomaeF says, it's Kingdom Hearts Donald, not Emoduck.

319
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,420
I think they're all cute.

320
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,500
Like I don't, I have to see what they evolve into, but we'll see.

321
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,860
I don't know if these names sound more, yeah, they definitely do sound Italian, like not

322
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:30,220
so much Castilian, but more Italian because like Fuecoco, you know, like, I don't know,

323
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,820
that would think that would be more Fiore, Fue would be like related to Spanish, I would

324
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
think.

325
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:46,140
But the, I'm missing the other T in Springatito and I'm wanting to say Springatitio, you know,

326
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:53,140
so maybe, yeah, I guess they are a little bit more of the Castilian variety.

327
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,220
We're getting a little lesson from Mike Deft in chat, who I know is fluent in Spanish,

328
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,740
saying Gatitio equals little cat in Spanish and Coco equals Coco Drilo, which is also

329
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,740
Spanish.

330
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Interesting.

331
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,240
So, well, we'll see.

332
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:17,220
My heart hurts that the cat is a grass type and that the fire type looks so freaking ridiculous.

333
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,220
Like I hate it.

334
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,860
I like that he's a cute little alligator.

335
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,300
I might just move on and play, you know, Dewey Duck.

336
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,440
I think a lot of people are going to play Dewey Duck.

337
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
That's for sure.

338
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
I don't know.

339
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,060
This might be the first time I start with a grass type if I play it because I'll be

340
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,820
honest, the last Pokemon game, I got halfway through it and I was like, this is why I don't

341
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,820
play Pokemon.

342
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,160
That was me with every single Pokemon game until Sword and Shield, which I absolutely

343
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,860
loved and beat.

344
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:54,780
So I did exactly the same with Sword and Shield as I do with every other Pokemon game.

345
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Exactly the same.

346
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,780
I made it a little bit further in that one.

347
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,860
I actually got like to the fifth gym and then I was like, oh, I'm bored now.

348
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
It's just repetitive.

349
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,980
Yeah, I get it.

350
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:12,240
For me, it's like, oh my God, I feel the need that I have to collect everything in one area.

351
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,620
And that can be very overwhelming.

352
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,580
But with Sword and Shield's very open area, it was, I don't know, it felt a little less

353
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,780
like daunting.

354
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,400
And now that this game is going to be all open area, it sounds like kind of like Arceus

355
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
a little bit.

356
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,120
It's just still separated into five areas.

357
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Let's be real.

358
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,920
But I'm into it.

359
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
I'm really open minded about it.

360
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
That's for sure.

361
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Let's see.

362
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,880
Okay, before we get into our gaming weeks, as we usually do towards the top of the show,

363
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,320
I think we have to say something.

364
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,840
I know we play video games to escape some of the dramas of the real world, but I think

365
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,920
we really have to acknowledge what's going on with Putin's invasion of Ukraine right

366
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,840
now, which is obviously an extraordinarily shitty situation.

367
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,320
I know a lot of people are saying it's Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is technically

368
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
accurate.

369
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,880
But I know there's a lot of Russian people that aren't happy about it either.

370
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,480
So I'm calling it Putin's one crazed madman's unnecessary invasion of a country.

371
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,120
And obviously, my heart goes out to, I don't know if we have listeners in Ukraine or that

372
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,520
area, but my heart goes out to the folks there and I hope everybody is safe throughout all

373
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
that.

374
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,920
There's an artist though that I follow in Russia, who I'm on Patreon.

375
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:32,040
He does NSFW stuff, but his art is beautiful, named Dima.

376
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,780
And he sent out a letter to all his patrons talking about how he's expecting like a full

377
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,640
internet lockdown.

378
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,760
And I mean, this is, you know, his livelihood.

379
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,360
And it's really, really depressing.

380
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,800
There's a lot of people in Russia who are negatively affected by this and completely

381
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,640
don't support the action whatsoever.

382
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,640
They're dealing with their you-know-who, you know?

383
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Yep.

384
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Yep.

385
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,440
And I've heard, unfortunately, some stuff on Facebook.

386
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,840
So I always take it with a grain of salt, but that we have a very large Russian population

387
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,320
here in the Sacramento area.

388
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,120
And unfortunately, I'm already hearing about people are bashing local businesses and stuff

389
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,020
when it's like, that makes no sense whatsoever because most people came over here to get

390
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,640
away from Putin and all that.

391
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,320
I mean, and then on top of the fact that again, not everybody in Russia is supporting what

392
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Putin's doing.

393
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,440
So don't be stupid about it.

394
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Yeah.

395
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,920
So let's just hope that a peaceful resolution can be found quickly.

396
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,840
And Putin obviously needs to lose a lot of the access that he has now.

397
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,200
I'm digressing a little bit, but this does have to do with video games, absolutely, because

398
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,320
a lot of your video games are being developed in Ukraine and the region and of course, streamers

399
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,400
and fans, of course, lots in Ukraine.

400
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,060
I was going to mention there's a very well-known Final Fantasy XIV streamer that was an American,

401
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,440
I believe, living in Ukraine, going to school or something like that.

402
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,680
And she's been given updates and I think she's in Poland right now as a lot of people have

403
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,940
gone over there and so forth.

404
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:20,860
So there's just a whole big fucking country getting attacked.

405
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,020
It's mind blowing when you're on the other side of the world.

406
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,060
You can't fathom what's going on.

407
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:30,580
But you're definitely hearing from people that are over there and gaming companies that

408
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,940
are over there and how they are reacting.

409
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:41,100
So we have GSE Game World, who is the studio that's behind the Stalker series or S-T-A-L-K-E-R.

410
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:49,620
They wrote a tweet that is asking folks to share their post with special aid information.

411
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,420
4A Games, who makes the Metro games, also shared a statement.

412
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,620
Frogwares said in their Twitter, we can't just stand by.

413
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,900
Russia attacks our homeland and denies the sovereignty of Ukraine.

414
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,840
We are trying to stay safe, but this is war.

415
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,140
There's no two ways about it.

416
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,380
We call on everyone to force Putin to withdraw from our lands.

417
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:15,220
Esports organizations, Navi is based out of Ukraine and shared a donation link.

418
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:21,060
Publishers, Crativo, TinyBuild, trying to help their employees that are based out of Ukraine.

419
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,340
I mean, this goes on and on and on.

420
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,900
I'm sure you've seen an awful lot on social media about it.

421
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,100
It definitely seems like, I don't know how y'all feel, but I definitely feel almost helpless

422
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,500
sometimes watching this stuff unfold on TV.

423
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,740
Obviously, there are humanitarian organizations that if you are able to, would happily be

424
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,540
able to accept donations and money and things like that, and there's no shortage of suggestions

425
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,180
out there online.

426
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,720
Spreading awareness is actually very important because there's disinformation campaigns going

427
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,380
on within Russia about what is actually happening.

428
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,540
Where have I heard of disinformation campaigns being a thing before?

429
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,340
Anyway, I don't want to get off the mark too much, but we know that disinformation goes

430
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,460
on out there, so sharing information is very important as well.

431
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,100
Mike Deaf points out, this war of mine is donating all their profits to help out Ukraine.

432
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Yes, I saw that.

433
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
The devs of that game.

434
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,860
The game is called This War of Mine.

435
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,860
That is 11-bit studios that made that game, that is doing that as well.

436
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,760
Obviously, the games industry is absolutely impacted by this because the entire world

437
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,900
is impacted by this.

438
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:35,500
I think this is why many of us really pray for, or whatever it is you do, for a quick

439
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,620
resolution to this whole situation.

440
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,660
Anything that any of my co-hosts wanted to add on that before we get to our gaming weeks?

441
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,940
No, I didn't really have anything.

442
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
He could stop.

443
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
That's the thing.

444
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
He could stop.

445
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
Anytime.

446
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,940
Supposedly, they are going to do some talks in Belarus.

447
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,460
I'm trying not to get too optimistic, but what else can I do?

448
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,620
But try to have hope.

449
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:15,620
I saw that people are wondering why Ukraine isn't trying to go for other methods, reach

450
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,260
out, but there was a sign that I saw that summed that up perfectly that Russia could

451
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,700
stop anytime and the war would be over.

452
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,940
If Ukraine stops, there's no more Ukraine.

453
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,660
That's an excellent point.

454
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:36,580
There's already pictures of bodies.

455
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,020
They may be triggering for some people.

456
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,620
I don't want to shy away from the fact.

457
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,240
That's fine if you can't look at it, but someone does need to see it and drive home.

458
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:52,500
It's one thing when you hear it on TV or see it on Twitter or something, or us talking

459
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,620
about it.

460
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,980
It's another thing when you let it become real for you.

461
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,980
On that note, though, and I think this is very important because we've seen where video

462
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,180
games again come into play here, be very careful of misinformation and trusted video sources

463
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,340
because we've seen on Twitter where old video game footage from war-based games is being

464
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,380
circulated and labeled actual footage from what's going on and people are really quick

465
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,220
to retweet that shit.

466
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,260
You've got to be very careful.

467
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:26,940
I think we all have a responsibility when we click that Retreat button or just question

468
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,020
the source.

469
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,620
If the source is coming from a news account you've never heard of, question that.

470
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,620
You've just got to be careful.

471
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:43,860
Again, for news sources that you do recognize, check them on the bias map.

472
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,740
You want to stay center of the road as much as possible.

473
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,100
If you do read something that's slanted one direction, make sure you read something that

474
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,180
is equally slanted the opposite direction.

475
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,140
Have a well-rounded view of it.

476
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,500
The truth will be somewhere in the middle.

477
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
J.B.

478
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,300
WOGAN There's a point that none of the fake videos use Command & Conquer Red Alert.

479
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,820
I mean, really, that's just a missed opportunity in my opinion.

480
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,820
A.P.

481
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,820
Not going to go there.

482
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
All right.

483
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,820
Moving on.

484
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,580
Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have been

485
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,140
playing this week and how was your gaming week.

486
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,940
How have you been taking your mind off of?

487
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,020
I mean, you think like just when COVID, I don't want to say COVID is going away because

488
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,900
we all know COVID is never going away.

489
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
But just when it seems like-

490
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,900
J.B.

491
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,900
WOGAN Oh, we're going into summer.

492
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
It's going to get bad.

493
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
A.P.

494
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,060
COVID is in a dip, we'll say.

495
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,580
Just when you think like COVID is in a dip and it's safe to do certain things, now this

496
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
happens.

497
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,540
And it's just like, can't we have a normal fucking summer ever again?

498
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
J.B.

499
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,540
WOGAN We're going to need a bigger boat.

500
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
A.P.

501
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,540
At least we have video games.

502
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,540
So how was your gaming week?

503
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
Dark Soccer.

504
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
I'll start with you as I always do.

505
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,140
J.B.

506
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,380
WOGAN Well, I pretty much my Saturday and Wednesday post work streams have been dedicated

507
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,260
to the Legend of Zelda and Link to the Past.

508
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,580
I am cheating because I can.

509
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,780
I'm not playing the game for a challenge.

510
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,340
I'm playing the game because I fucking love the game and I love playing it and I love

511
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,220
going around and finding shit.

512
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:13,740
You know, I once again, true to form, did the palaces out of order because I always

513
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,220
do blind the thief before I do the forest palace.

514
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,500
And I don't even know why.

515
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,860
I've always done it that way.

516
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,900
And I keep thinking, oh, I'll do it the right way.

517
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,640
Well, isn't blind first?

518
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Don't I do that one first?

519
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
No.

520
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,220
So I just said, screw it.

521
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,660
I can do them out of order if I want to.

522
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,660
I'm an adult.

523
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,620
So, um, but I finished, um, palace six.

524
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:43,040
I now have all of the items except what I need from, uh, seven and eight, which I get

525
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:51,300
the one of the staves, I think either in seven or eight and then the mirror shield.

526
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,980
Um, and I get the red mail from somewhere as well.

527
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:01,780
I got, I got the, the one stave last night, uh, staff staves, you know what I mean?

528
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,420
Um, at any rate, um, I've really, I've really been enjoying that and I'm trying

529
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,820
to decide what I want to do next.

530
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,860
I might do terror enigma or I might do playing, you know, shooter of Saturn games and being

531
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,220
bad at it.

532
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,580
Like the original gun bird or radiant silver gun, or I might actually play grandia.

533
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,040
I have a translated Saturn version of it and I'm actually kind of considering playing grandia.

534
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
So we'll see.

535
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,260
Maybe I'll make a poll.

536
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:31,820
I definitely moving on the soul blazer trilogy with a terror enigma.

537
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,260
I well, I played such a good underrated series.

538
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,540
And the one I haven't really played a whole lot of is terror enigma.

539
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,660
So that's kind of why I'm thinking about that.

540
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,780
I'm also considering Seiken Densetsu three, so we'll see.

541
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,100
I've got so many, you know, things up, up, you know, on my list and everything.

542
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,380
I might even just play like bad power Rangers games.

543
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,380
I don't know.

544
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,380
I'll figure it out.

545
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,020
But, um, I'm also of course playing dead by daylight.

546
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:00,180
I've been hanging out with Debbie a little bit less because, uh, she's a bitch.

547
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,820
Um, I have accidentally adopted nemesis.

548
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:11,540
Like oops, I, I adopted, um, so that's another one off of my list cause I hate playing nemesis.

549
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
I did a chat.

550
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,100
It's like the challenge that they give you like right when you start off the game.

551
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,800
I forgot what they call those challenges, like the dailies.

552
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,460
And it was to sacrifice two people.

553
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,500
I didn't remember that I still had my adapt build on so, and I expected to totally like

554
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:36,020
kill nobody because I suck at nemesis, but I got a four K and I thanked the people I

555
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
played against.

556
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:43,300
Uh, you know, I, I, okay, so I have to take a little tangent, little tangent.

557
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:50,820
I have been doing this thing now where instead of being bitchy or trolly in postgame chat,

558
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:57,500
I'm actually being really nice, really nice, like, Hey, I'm a little bit off my game.

559
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Congrats.

560
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,300
Hope you have a great night.

561
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,300
And if people are really cool, then I will give them my favorite blessing.

562
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:08,380
May you jump in the hatch in front of a camping basement, Bubba.

563
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:15,100
Um, and for the most part, people who have started off being like really rude and trolly

564
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,220
actually apologize and turn around because I have made them feel like shit because that's,

565
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,660
that's what's reverse trolling, reverse trolling.

566
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,420
Or there's people who are genuinely nice and you know, and I typically mean it when I say

567
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,220
have a good evening and are like, Oh, well you too.

568
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,620
And that's my little piece to combat toxicity in the game.

569
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,440
And so far it actually makes my games feel like they're more fun when I'm done.

570
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,540
If I put a little positive spin at the end, I mean, the one thing I'll do is like, Oh,

571
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,180
all of you are great except for the loser that disconnected.

572
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,260
And then I report them.

573
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,380
So that's the one thing I'm trying to do.

574
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:57,740
I'm trying to make my little corner of gaming slightly more delightful instead of toxic

575
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
sludge.

576
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,740
I like that.

577
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,740
Yeah.

578
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:06,460
Um, I am also of course still playing Fantasian, but now I am like way too low level to do

579
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,740
damn near anything.

580
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:14,140
Like I got my ass handed to me on a battle that it said I was at the right level for.

581
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:23,220
So I might actually do more of Fantasian offline just to, uh, just to grind a little bit and

582
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:30,260
uh, go back to, go back to it when I'm not feeling as, uh, pained by it.

583
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:37,380
So, um, and you know, other than that, it's just been, you know, we had some pinball stuff

584
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
going on.

585
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,180
We're making some hard decisions about which ones we're going to sell to afford the big

586
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,180
one.

587
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:50,220
Um, they disassembled creature from the black lagoon in the living room yesterday while

588
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
I was working.

589
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,260
And that was really intensely annoying.

590
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,260
Oh, wow.

591
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:59,020
But other than that, been, been pretty, been pretty okay.

592
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
Been pretty okay.

593
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:06,180
So yeah, just those are, those are my, oh, and wordscapes, but it doesn't count.

594
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,180
All right, Loki, we'll go to you.

595
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,560
How was your gaming week?

596
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:18,240
It was Minecraft, surprise, um, no, so I actually did play a bit of, um, nerdcraft is mostly

597
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,880
like kind of editing stuff, but I did a little bit of, uh, nerdcraft stuff.

598
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,680
I posted a video as a second part of a video I posted, uh, the previous to that, uh, cause

599
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
I had a lot of footage.

600
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,960
I had to split it up in two because it had been way too long otherwise.

601
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,360
And then I've been working on a mod pack for, uh, the one 19 snapshot that just came out.

602
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:45,320
So they have a brand new kind of, uh, experimental snapshot featuring the warden, which is kind

603
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:51,860
of the new like boss creature that's in the, will be in the upcoming Minecraft version.

604
00:30:51,860 --> 00:31:00,000
And so I created a mod pack with, um, the data packs and stuff in there to spread this

605
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,320
block called skulk around the entire world, basically.

606
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,680
Um, with that skulk has this thing called a skulk sensor that detects vibrations.

607
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:17,840
And if you, um, do enough movement or hit things or whatever, it'll send off, it can

608
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,280
possibly send off this other block, which is called a skulk shrieker.

609
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,080
And if that goes off in the right scenario, then the warden spawns and it's basically

610
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
not easily killed.

611
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,480
I mean, you can kind of cheese it right now cause it's still work in progress, but it's,

612
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,120
you know, basically a tank.

613
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,200
You can't just like fight it hand to hand.

614
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,840
You have to kind of cheese it if you want to win.

615
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,960
So I'm building a whole Minecraft hardcore series around that where it's just spawning

616
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
everywhere.

617
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,160
Cause I see all these videos of people like going into the new biome in the game called

618
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,960
the deep dark and they're like, Oh my God, once, you know, warden, this is so intense

619
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
and stuff.

620
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
I'm like, you haven't seen anything yet.

621
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,880
So, um, that's what I'm working on.

622
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
So I have a new series.

623
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,040
I put out a little teaser trailer for it called the deep dark world, and then I just

624
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,760
needed to start filming it.

625
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,080
I did kind of a live stream last Sunday, a similar concept I added.

626
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,640
I finally got shares working.

627
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,120
So that's why I'm also restarting the series and the seed was on before was kind of boring.

628
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:23,760
So I'm going to try to get a better seed to play in and then, um, yeah.

629
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,860
And so we'll film that and then kind of want to edit, you know, uh, very, uh, cinematically.

630
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,660
So I'll do that the side from all that, uh, gaming wise, I got a new computer.

631
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,600
Um, it's not hooked up yet because it's slightly broken at the moment.

632
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,760
So it, it's, it's no fault of the person that sent it to me.

633
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,760
It's something came loose or something happened in shipping.

634
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:56,180
And so my radiator on it, the fans don't spin, they, they light up, but they don't spin,

635
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:03,220
which tells me that the, uh, PC fan, uh, cable or whatever, whatever's controlling

636
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,460
the speed of the fans is not hooked up or something.

637
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,860
Although I can't see anything that's disconnected.

638
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,340
So, um, I don't know, I'm going to probably have to take it to a shop to have them look

639
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,340
at it.

640
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,500
Cause I just, I just don't want to mess with it.

641
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,420
Um, but it's very nice.

642
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:24,900
It's um, it's an I nine, I think 10, 900, uh, KF or something like that.

643
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,940
Um, I think that's what it was maybe 10, 700.

644
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:32,380
I don't remember, but it's, you know, 10 cores, 20 threads, uh, fast three, seven up to I

645
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:39,660
think five, four, um, gigahertz as 32 gigs of Ram, six terabyte hard drives.

646
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:45,960
Um, it's a got a 30, 80 TI in it and a dedicated capture card.

647
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,100
So it's like perfect for streaming.

648
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,140
Um, so that's kind of what I wanted it for.

649
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,740
Um, also cause my stupid laptop is so loud that I have to literally edit my voice.

650
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:02,300
I have to record my voice separate and then I have to edit out these loud fan from it.

651
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,580
Although now that I look at it, you know, I've, this thing has like so many fans on

652
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,580
it.

653
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:13,160
It may be louder, but, and I had to have it on my desk cause, uh, you know, the cables

654
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
won't reach otherwise.

655
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,460
Um, it will be a mess.

656
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:25,260
So hopefully it's not louder, but I'm looking forward to playing around the 30, 80 TI cause

657
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
it's going to be pretty good.

658
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,160
I mean, this is not bad right now.

659
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,500
It's got a 20, 70 in it, but you know, it'd be nice not to have a laptop anymore.

660
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,340
Um, cause I've been playing on like gaming laptops for a while and um, it's just nice

661
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,940
to have like a dedicated desktops.

662
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,980
I don't really take my computer anywhere anymore.

663
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,580
I used to like take it all over the place and it liked to the show and stuff, but, um,

664
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,420
you know, it'll be nice to kind of have that.

665
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,900
Plus we'll still have my laptop if I need to, you know, do stuff with it.

666
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,900
All right.

667
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,540
Um, let's see, my gaming week, uh, my gaming week was pretty unexciting because of the

668
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,660
move and everything.

669
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,380
So there's very little I've been playing, uh, like, like dark Sakura has her word scapes.

670
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,660
I've been playing word hole.

671
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,140
Uh, but now, now it's not just wordle.

672
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,980
I really enjoy cordle, the one that's four of them at once.

673
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:15,540
And then the one that's really awesome as is seto wordle or it's 16, 16 wordles, all

674
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,300
at once in 21 guesses, uh, that one is a lot of fun.

675
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,180
So I've, I've still found, found time for things like that.

676
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,740
Uh, but otherwise, as far as like playing like actual games, like my consoles aren't

677
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,740
even hooked up right now.

678
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,940
Um, that's something I've got to take care of in the coming days.

679
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,220
I had to get some new HDMI cables.

680
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,100
I really want to get on the new expedition for no man's sky.

681
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,020
So when I do get set up, I'm hoping I can do some streaming.

682
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,300
The nice thing about this new space, Alan and I have separate spaces.

683
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,900
We can stream together and our internet, now that we have fiber internet, we don't

684
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
have cable.

685
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
We have fiber now.

686
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,220
So our, our upload is as fast as our downloads.

687
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,460
So that is, that is why also dark soccer and Loki can actually see the show.

688
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,980
I don't know if you guys know for the past, you know, however long we've been doing the

689
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,160
show virtually, they could never see me during the show.

690
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,620
You guys could be, but they couldn't, but now I'm uploading so much.

691
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,100
Uh, they can see me, you can see me and, uh, Alan could probably be streaming right now

692
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,020
as well and it wouldn't affect anything.

693
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,460
So that'll be really fun.

694
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,660
So I'm hoping we can get into that and maybe some, uh, dead by daylight and who knows what,

695
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,500
but honestly, I've been playing a little dead by daylight, uh, and Final Fantasy 14, just

696
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,380
because they're on my PC, easy decompression games.

697
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,180
Um, but I haven't been playing a lot.

698
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,400
I would say my big dead by daylight achievement, I got Felix to level 50 and I'm probably going

699
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,660
to prestige him.

700
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,860
Um, and that's because he still doesn't have borrowed time.

701
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,900
So I'll probably just prestige him.

702
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,780
Um, and that does remind me.

703
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,140
Yeah, I should have pig P three 50 this week.

704
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:44,620
Oh, nice.

705
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,060
Congrats.

706
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,660
Um, I, there is one game.

707
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:47,940
Okay.

708
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,820
So here's the nice thing.

709
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,500
Now that I have the fiber internet, that's unlimited.

710
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,540
I went through and patched all these fucking games that I've been waiting on for so long.

711
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,540
And even Alan reminded me last night, you could download flight simulator again.

712
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,900
And I was like, I could, you're right.

713
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,380
I haven't done that yet, but one of the games that I patched, I've been waiting on for forever

714
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,180
is DJ max technica on a PC, the steam version.

715
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,500
And I actually played a little bit of that.

716
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,300
I don't, when did they start doing season content and that game?

717
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,420
Cause I've missed that and they're up to like season four.

718
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:20,940
Whoops.

719
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,660
Uh, so I was playing a little bit of that.

720
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,700
I had to play flea.

721
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,620
It's my favorite song.

722
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,300
And then I was checking out some other songs that they've added in that as well.

723
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,020
So I guess there was a little bit of that, that might add a surprise in a good way.

724
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,100
Some of our music game fans is that I was getting back into DJ max technica this week.

725
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,340
Thanks to, uh, getting everything patched.

726
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,220
All right.

727
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,180
Um, that's it for our gaming week.

728
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,220
Let's get into some more news again, if you're just joining us tonight.

729
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,860
Uh, this is the first show in a new space.

730
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,940
Some things may be a little bit off and echoey while we try to get things worked out.

731
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,380
So sorry about that, but we wanted to do a show, which is better than no show.

732
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,540
Uh, let's get to some big headlines this week.

733
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,940
Loki.

734
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,220
Yes.

735
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,220
Capcom had teased with a countdown and then an announcement.

736
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:11,700
Um, street fighter six is coming out with ultra wide, uh, Ryu.

737
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:19,940
He is like super ultra wide and his very defined Dick in the trailer.

738
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,940
Or at least that's what some people are seeing in that trailer.

739
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,220
I'm just saying, you know, he was my first video game crush.

740
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:28,780
Oh yeah.

741
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,220
He's still my video game crush.

742
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:30,740
Come on.

743
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,020
No, I, I think, I think it's just a fold.

744
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,300
And the clothes, but you know how some people will, it's what do they call it?

745
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,180
The Roshashark test, the ink blots.

746
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,740
Some people will see different things and some people are seeing some things in Ryu's

747
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,260
pants.

748
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,340
So there is that.

749
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,060
Um, but yeah, the, the trailer was, it's short.

750
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,420
It didn't show any gameplay whatsoever.

751
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,780
So it wasn't,

752
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,060
I don't know who the other character is.

753
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,460
I don't know if it's a new character or some other character, but

754
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,820
I think his name is Lucas.

755
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,220
He was the last street fighter five DLC character.

756
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,540
And I'm assuming it is what was all intended to be a tie into six all along.

757
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,820
So, um, I think that's what that is.

758
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,740
Yeah.

759
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,300
Okay.

760
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,580
Um, the more exciting thing I think is actually the Capcom fighting collection,

761
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,740
which has a bunch of different games in there, uh, including dark

762
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,180
stockers, the night warriors, night warriors, dark stockers, revenge, vampire

763
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:28,180
hunter to dark stockers, revenge, vampire savior, vampire savior to red earth, super

764
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:33,100
gem fighter, mini mix cyber bots, full metal madness, super puzzle fighter to

765
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,780
turbo and hyper street fighter to the anniversary edition.

766
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,220
There's not as many red earth.

767
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,580
I know.

768
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,420
I was going to say, you said a bunch of games and red earth, red earth.

769
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,740
Yeah.

770
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,340
There's not a lot of street fighter in there because they just did a street

771
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,100
fighter collection.

772
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,180
So it makes sense.

773
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,700
Um, but yeah, dark Sakura.

774
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,940
Uh, I don't know if you've done red earth as a classic game of the week, but let's,

775
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,820
let's talk about that.

776
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,540
Why are you so excited about this?

777
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,700
It never got any sort of home port.

778
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,260
Here anyway, did it, did it?

779
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,500
No, I guess it never came out in Japan either.

780
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:06,940
Wow.

781
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,180
No, it's they, you, I mean, the, the two times I've played, it was once in an

782
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,580
arcade game and another one on somebody's a CPS converter.

783
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,540
Wow.

784
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,980
And it had, it had another name in Japan, right?

785
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,780
It was, uh, I can't remember the name of it.

786
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,900
They call it somebody in chat.

787
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,460
No, I know what it was called.

788
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,180
It was, um, called, uh, uh, Warzard.

789
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,140
That's it.

790
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,660
Warzard.

791
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,100
Yeah.

792
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:31,860
Yeah.

793
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,420
Nice.

794
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:40,140
And on top of that, the red earth wasn't really that widespread here in the U S

795
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,940
and the only character that a lot of people knew from that game was, uh, um,

796
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,900
Tessa or Tabasa.

797
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:53,860
Uh, dark Tetsuya, uh, a well, our historian in the house saying red earth was the

798
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,340
classic game of the week, episode 829.

799
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,900
That's a little more recently than I would have thought that

800
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,380
was three years ago.

801
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,100
Nice.

802
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,340
But it's, it's a beautiful game.

803
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:12,020
I mean, of course it's got that sort of alpha, um, era artwork, but I mean, the

804
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:18,100
game came out in, in 96 and it's, it's still just as beautiful, but you know,

805
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,500
what's not as beautiful the new street fighter six logo.

806
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,620
It's beautiful.

807
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,020
I don't hate it.

808
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,260
I don't, I heard the clip art thing.

809
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,660
I think that's just a weird coincidence because it is a minimalist style.

810
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:39,060
I don't hate it, but it's like when you don't show a single frame of the game,

811
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,180
which is what Capcom chose to do.

812
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,340
And I understand a teaser is a teaser fine.

813
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,820
And all you give is the logo for people to dissect and make their

814
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,220
three hour YouTube's about, then this is exactly what you're going to get.

815
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:51,700
Right.

816
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,620
Is what's happening in this particular case.

817
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,860
So, you know, I don't hate the logo, but I want to see it emotion.

818
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,180
I want to see like, what is the, what does the UI look like?

819
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,940
You know, does it justify the logo?

820
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:09,740
So, um, going back to the Capcom fighting collection, we have a lot of people in

821
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,540
chat that of course are bringing up, uh, rival schools, uh, and the, or the

822
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,700
lack thereof in this collection, SSJ owner Matt says project justice or rival

823
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,460
school just can't get on these Capcom collections.

824
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:22,700
Yeah.

825
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,580
What's up with that?

826
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:28,620
Is it just one of those Capcom is saving it for a different collection or I mean,

827
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:34,140
I usually like to think they're just being assholes is not like really like an

828
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,660
explanation, although God damn when Nintendo's back catalog, it sure sometimes

829
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,900
feels like it, but I feel like there's gotta be a bit like, is there a rights

830
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,340
issue?

831
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,420
I don't know about like maybe the music.

832
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,540
I have no idea.

833
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,540
It's wild.

834
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,900
Isn't it like, because that's the 3d engine, whereas these are all 2d.

835
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,180
I mean, it's that have anything to do with it?

836
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,580
You think?

837
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,220
Possibly, but I feel like that hasn't stopped other games.

838
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,540
Don't they have like, I'm sure that they've got emulators at this point that

839
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,260
can handle rival schools.

840
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,180
They're like, I wouldn't be that hard.

841
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:10,140
Now DJRMS again, this is all just rumors and, you know, conclusion jumping.

842
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,540
I think it's a good way to put it, but it's a, it's a logical one.

843
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,980
It's plausible.

844
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,540
We'll say, uh, DJRMS says supposedly Capcom lost the license to rival schools.

845
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,140
I assume because the rival schools was done on the EX engine, which is

846
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:28,580
connected to Arika, I think so that could be in the characters.

847
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,180
Yeah, I guess so, but that could explain why the other game has never been just

848
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,100
like re-released to one of these collections.

849
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,980
So, uh, Zen Monkey 11 says, you know what?

850
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,540
They just ruined rival schools.

851
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,140
Let it stay the gem that it is.

852
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,020
I can see that perspective as well.

853
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,220
You'll never, you'll never top the original.

854
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:45,860
Who knows?

855
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,460
No, I, I, how did they, how did they ruin it?

856
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,660
Project Justice was great.

857
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:57,460
Well, but, but it's many, many years later now than the distance between those two.

858
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,420
So maybe, I don't know.

859
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:58,940
I don't know.

860
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,820
Uh, Mike Deff does say they didn't lose it because there's literally a rival

861
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,300
school's character in the last season past the Street Fighter 5.

862
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:10,060
So the characters, I think, yeah, the IP and all that, uh, is probably still good,

863
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,340
but we don't know so much about the actual game game.

864
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,660
Uh, as Joe and Hermat does point out, maybe it's connected to why we don't see

865
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,660
Street Fighter EX in any of these collections as well.

866
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,340
Who knows?

867
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,140
Uh, but more to come on Street Fighter 6 in the future, I'm sure.

868
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:30,580
Speaking of big games with a 6 in them, uh, many, many people happy about the

869
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:34,980
release of the Final Fantasy 6 pixel remaster this week, uh, and this is a

870
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,740
little bit different than the other five pixel remasters that they did because

871
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,340
they've actually put some of that, like two and a half D stuff in this game,

872
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,420
namely the opera scene.

873
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,860
So whereas Final Fantasy 6 pretty much looks like all the other pixel remasters

874
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,740
throughout the entire game, the opera scene they decided to make look a little,

875
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,740
they kicked it up a notch and that doesn't just include this new graphics,

876
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,980
but there's actual singing.

877
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,140
So they actually gave Celeste voice lines and they have an actress singing it.

878
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,820
Now, some people are critical that the voice actress doesn't really

879
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,780
sound like an opera singer, but a lot of people pointing out that would

880
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,820
actually be canon.

881
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,940
If you think about the story and the way that Celeste ends up in the

882
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,980
opera scene anyway, she's not supposed to be a professional opera singer.

883
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,580
Funny enough, in an interview with Nobuo Uematsu talking about all this,

884
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:31,700
Uematsu kind of confirms this, saying in a quote, the Draco opera song was

885
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,460
supposed to be sung by an opera singer, but Celeste would suddenly appear on

886
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,180
the stage.

887
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,660
If Celeste could actually sing real opera, that would be a lie.

888
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:44,380
So we had the fixation to intentionally choose someone whose vocals didn't seem

889
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,300
like an opera singer, but more like a musical singer.

890
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,580
So that is kind of interesting.

891
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,620
By the way, if you want, you can hear this now.

892
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,740
It's actually been dubbed or whatever in many different languages.

893
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:01,100
American English is one of them, but it also exists in Italian, German,

894
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:06,700
Spanish, Korean, I believe Japanese as well for sure would make sense.

895
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,660
And I think there was one other that's not in this list for some reason, but

896
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,900
still very cool that that all time classic scene exists in all those

897
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,780
different languages.

898
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,740
If you want something more authentic to opera, maybe watch it in Italian and

899
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,380
see what you think.

900
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,860
I'm sure it's all on YouTube by now.

901
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,540
That's for sure.

902
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,300
So a dark to see in chat says, yeah, the opera thing makes sense.

903
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:29,460
She's a general for the empire and the opera singer thing fell into her lap.

904
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:29,820
Yeah.

905
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:35,140
So, um, I'm very, I really, really want to play the six remaster.

906
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,340
The music, the soundtrack is fire.

907
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,860
Like it's really good.

908
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:45,220
Um, I'm also kind of being a stick in the mud because I want them to fucking

909
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,380
release this on console.

910
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,460
Like how hard is that to do to release this game on console?

911
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,780
Um, and I'm, I'm hoping they, I'm hoping they do.

912
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,540
That's for sure.

913
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,860
So we'll see what happens with that.

914
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:02,620
Um, on a related note, and I talked about this two weeks ago, cause you

915
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,620
might remember two weeks ago, we were talking about that Nintendo direct and

916
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,540
the surprise announcement of live alive.

917
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:13,980
And I said, you know, baby, baby, this is a test to see if chrono trigger

918
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,340
is going to happen in this engine.

919
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,500
We'll get this, a report from Fumitsu talking to the developers of triangle

920
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,300
strategy.

921
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,220
They confirmed on a square Enix radio show that president Yotsuka Matsuda once

922
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,220
super Nintendo games remade in that art style.

923
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,380
Well, well, what other super Nintendo games are left?

924
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,460
I suppose there's others, but I'm just, I like to be very tunnel visioned on

925
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:43,980
this in a quote, producer Tomoya Asano said, the president ordered us to make

926
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,820
more use of HD 2d.

927
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,980
So we decided to think about remakes of past titles.

928
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,860
So we lined up possible titles and thought about which could be done in HD

929
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,980
2d and brought them to the president.

930
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,580
The list in here's here.

931
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,060
Now wait for this.

932
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,780
This is the real exciting part.

933
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,620
So dark Sakura, you were just talking about Terra enigma, right?

934
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,460
Keep that in mind.

935
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:14,660
The list included titles released by square and Enix for the super Famicom

936
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,660
ones, which were suitable for HD 2d ones, which were unsuitable for it.

937
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,860
And ones which were a possible to play like mahjong games.

938
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,860
Fuck the mahjong games.

939
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,980
We know I want my shop.

940
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,940
Some people are into those.

941
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,700
They, they can have, they can go sit in a corner with the 5,000 other mahjong

942
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,020
titles that exist.

943
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:39,700
Give me fucking, how many of those mahjong titles are in HD 2d, not very

944
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,220
many.

945
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,780
We lined them all up and made a presentation that live alive was the most

946
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,340
suitable.

947
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:52,300
The second place was Actraiser and Actraiser has already been released on the

948
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:57,140
switch as Actraiser Renaissance, even if it didn't end up using the same style.

949
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,220
That is very interesting.

950
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:06,020
The fact, I, I, I didn't even consider two weeks ago, Enix titles could be in play

951
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:06,700
as well.

952
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,340
That is, that's exciting.

953
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,740
That's very exciting.

954
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,060
Some comments about the Fanta SE 6 remaster in chat.

955
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,980
5th Dream says the new veld theme, Wild West is so good.

956
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,620
Yes, it is.

957
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,060
I heard it.

958
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,020
It's very, very good.

959
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,220
Mike Deff says about the opera scene.

960
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,660
It's awesome that it translated for many languages.

961
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,540
Interested to check that out.

962
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,820
Dartitsuya in chat says Rob hates mahjong confirmed.

963
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:37,100
I spent hours and hours playing mahjong solitaire, which was released here as

964
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,900
Shanghai.

965
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,420
You might remember that from like the late 80s.

966
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,540
It was like a quintessential Mac game.

967
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:48,300
And I remember my uncle had a Mac for his business and he had Shanghai installed on

968
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,180
it, which is, it's just mahjong solitaire.

969
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,260
And I played the shit out of that game.

970
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,060
That's the one where you have the titles and you can only move them out to the side.

971
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,300
You can't move them up and down.

972
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,140
That's how it works.

973
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,460
So that's, yeah, that's, that should be a classic game sometime, sometime if it hasn't

974
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:02,860
already.

975
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,420
I don't know, maybe.

976
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,060
So yeah, Dartitsuya says, Oh yeah, I think I remember those tile matching games.

977
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,980
So I don't hate mahjong.

978
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,900
I just, we've, we've had that.

979
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,180
We don't need more.

980
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,020
And that's, that's my opinion.

981
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,980
I'm entitled to it.

982
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,140
All right, let's move on to our Sakura.

983
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,220
So I hope I'm not muted because I would be sad.

984
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,260
Okay.

985
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,780
So Nintendo actually did buy somebody as we teased before the show.

986
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:44,620
So Nintendo has actually acquired one of their partner companies, which is SRD company

987
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,100
limited.

988
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:53,420
They were a developer of about 140 employees that has worked exclusively on first party

989
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:56,220
Nintendo software for about 40 years.

990
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:03,940
They operate near Nintendo's Kyoto headquarters started in 1979 and worked on games as far

991
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:08,980
back as Donkey Kong and have been, had a hand in just about every major Nintendo franchise,

992
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,740
including the Mario games, Zelda games, animal crossing.

993
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:16,140
The last thing that they worked on was game builder garage, ring fit adventure, and one

994
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,820
two switch.

995
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:26,180
So the acquisition is expected to close on April 1st, assuming it gets approved.

996
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:33,140
Basically the switch is a level of success, allow them to invest in different business

997
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:33,940
opportunities.

998
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:40,700
That's including an $880 million expansion of the game development capability.

999
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:48,780
And their president, Futakara Shintaro said that it would spend up to a hundred billion

1000
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:53,860
yen, which is about 880 million, expanding internal game development and up to 50 billion

1001
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,100
yen.

1002
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,740
That's about 440 million growing non-game entertainment software assets like movies.

1003
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:06,140
So they've already started office construction to expand the Kyoto office and wanting to

1004
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,500
create more games in-house than outsource.

1005
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,180
So, yeah, pretty big news.

1006
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,060
I mean, not a lot of people know of that company, but they know of what they've done.

1007
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,540
Yeah.

1008
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:23,060
And it's funny because, again, going back to two weeks ago when Activision was bought by

1009
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:29,020
Microsoft, Bungie was bought by Sony, a lot of people were like, who's Nintendo going to

1010
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:29,220
buy?

1011
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:29,820
Konami?

1012
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,460
And it was like, no, that's not how Nintendo works.

1013
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:38,300
Nintendo buys companies that they, and exactly what those of us that actually pay

1014
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:42,260
attention throughout the years have been saying is this is exactly what's happening.

1015
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:46,580
Nintendo is effectively buying somebody that honest to God, I thought they already owned.

1016
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,340
Especially when you talk about the games that they made.

1017
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,580
How did they not already own the developers of Ring Fit Adventure and 1-2 Switch?

1018
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:57,100
Honestly, I honestly thought Nintendo already owned them.

1019
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,740
And that is very much who Nintendo buys.

1020
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,700
Companies you thought were already a part of Nintendo.

1021
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,260
And as to 100, Matt says, yeah, I agree.

1022
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,580
I thought they already owned them.

1023
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,380
Yeah, exactly.

1024
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:08,660
Right.

1025
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,780
So, but there you go.

1026
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,220
Now you all can shut up.

1027
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,380
Nintendo bought somebody.

1028
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,940
So everybody bought somebody.

1029
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,220
It's a new round.

1030
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:18,900
Round two.

1031
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,580
We'll see what happens in the next round of acquisitions.

1032
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,220
Right.

1033
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:23,780
All right.

1034
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,660
Who's going to get EA?

1035
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,220
Stay tuned.

1036
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,020
All right.

1037
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,780
Moving on.

1038
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:34,860
I was going to say maybe Nintendo might have their eye on EA.

1039
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:35,660
I'm kidding.

1040
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:37,620
All right.

1041
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:37,900
I know.

1042
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,180
If your podcast is telling you that, I'm sorry, I shouldn't be shady.

1043
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,420
I shouldn't be shady.

1044
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,300
I think I'm just, I'm jaded having done this.

1045
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,340
Just do it, Rob.

1046
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:46,700
All right.

1047
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,380
If your podcast is saying that Nintendo is going to buy EA.

1048
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,820
Your podcast isn't paying attention to the gaming industry.

1049
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,580
That's all I'm going to say.

1050
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:59,940
Especially after EA left them at the fucking altar with the Wii U stuff.

1051
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,700
Nintendo's not buying EA.

1052
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,500
All right.

1053
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:03,620
Moving on.

1054
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:07,300
Let's get into S200, Matt says, drag them, Rob.

1055
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:07,900
I will.

1056
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,420
I will.

1057
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,380
Perhaps in a new video game, Dark Soccer, we'll talk about later.

1058
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,540
Meanwhile, some companies are buying, some companies are offloading, right, Loki?

1059
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:17,940
Yes.

1060
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:23,660
Well, some some companies are finally reversing course on the dumbest decisions

1061
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:29,660
I've seen in the industry that is self-contained launchers for different

1062
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,180
companies.

1063
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:35,620
So Bethesda is getting rid of its launcher and it's going back to Steam.

1064
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,820
So that's right.

1065
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,820
You'll access all your games through Steam where it should be accessed and not

1066
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,860
through Bethesda's stupid launcher.

1067
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,660
I'm down.

1068
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,220
I love that.

1069
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,700
Yeah, I actually have the Bethesda launcher because you could grab free games

1070
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,580
on there for a while, like Quake, the original Quake.

1071
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,900
Oh, actually, I think they gave away the whole trilogy at some point.

1072
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,540
So it'll be nice to just roll that into Steam.

1073
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,460
Yeah, and it will be able to migrate to Steam as well.

1074
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:05,860
Yeah.

1075
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,660
So that is why I installed the Bethesda launcher.

1076
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,380
You can't transfer things over yet.

1077
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,220
That doesn't happen until I think April.

1078
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,220
Yeah, April is when they're sunsetting that.

1079
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,420
Yeah, when I read the news, I was like, oh, okay, let me move things over to

1080
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:18,740
Steam.

1081
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,980
And it was like, hold on, bitch, you got to wait until April to do that.

1082
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,100
I think there was another big thing they gave away not that long ago.

1083
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,620
I don't think it was Skyrim or anything like that.

1084
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:30,180
But I think Bethesda launched, they really tried to get people on that

1085
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,300
launcher with freebies.

1086
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,620
And well, there's just too many launchers.

1087
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:40,860
This one had to go and there's others that have to go to Ubisoft.

1088
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:46,780
But yeah, Ubisoft, they don't see them doing it because they have their, don't

1089
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,780
they have a marketplace built into that as well?

1090
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,500
So them in origin.

1091
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,260
Did they?

1092
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,620
I thought, I thought you could buy the games through the Bethesda launcher.

1093
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,180
I'm almost positive that was part of it.

1094
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:58,740
It had to be.

1095
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,540
I don't remember.

1096
00:55:59,580 --> 00:55:59,940
Yeah.

1097
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,980
But yeah, you play is a little bit, come on, like Ubisoft is never going to do

1098
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,820
what's right for anybody or their employees because they're still, you

1099
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,900
know, protecting harassers of women at their company.

1100
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,660
So of course, they're not going to have anybody's best interests other than

1101
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,940
themselves in mind.

1102
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,500
So they'll never get rid of that launcher.

1103
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,900
Dark to see your reminds during QuakeCon.

1104
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,700
And then at this last year's, they let people upgrade to Quake Remastered for

1105
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,100
free if you had the original.

1106
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:26,300
Yeah.

1107
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,300
So if you've, if you've just had that installer sitting on your computer

1108
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,460
grabbing freebies, I think about our listener in the past, who I haven't seen

1109
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,900
in a while, but he used to always call in about the game deals and stuff and

1110
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:36,700
freebies.

1111
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,900
And I'm thinking like that guy just got a big payoff with this.

1112
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,500
If he's been collecting the Bethesda, he's going to have a steam library.

1113
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,300
It's going to really increase in size after this.

1114
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,740
As Stu and Hanumat says, they gave away a ton of games in that game awards video.

1115
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,940
That was nothing but a long line of free game codes.

1116
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,740
Yes, that's, that's very true.

1117
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,340
Very true.

1118
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,340
All right.

1119
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:59,380
Well, I know we weren't here last week, but there was at least one really big

1120
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,980
headline from last week that I think we ought to touch on.

1121
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,180
There was more than one, but I think this is really the big one that a lot of people

1122
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:05,860
were talking about.

1123
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:11,820
And that is the fact that Nintendo plans to end the Wii U and 3DS eShop purchases.

1124
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,740
And that is going to end in March of 2023.

1125
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:20,500
So you still have some time, but not a lot because the clock actually starts ticking

1126
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,060
in May.

1127
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:27,140
So on May 23rd of 2022, you will no longer be able to use a credit card to add funds

1128
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,580
to your eShop account via Wii U or 3DS.

1129
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:34,380
On August 29th, you can't use eShop cards to add funds anymore either.

1130
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,980
You can still use download codes, but only until March when everything sunsets.

1131
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:45,420
So now I believe if you already have downloaded games, you will still be able

1132
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,100
to download them because that's still the case on the Wii.

1133
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,860
They closed the Wii eShop some time ago, but you can still download old titles there.

1134
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,340
For how much longer?

1135
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,220
Who knows?

1136
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,540
But Wii U and 3DS is going to be closing.

1137
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:03,940
And that's a pretty big deal because obviously the 3DS had a huge long life.

1138
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:08,300
There's a lot of titles on there you can't play anywhere else.

1139
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,740
Somebody put together a list of like 2,000 titles off the top of my head.

1140
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,340
Harmonite was one that the Pokemon Company did.

1141
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,340
There's a lot of games on the 3DS that were only ever on the 3DS.

1142
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:23,340
And right now you think the Switch is backwards compatible?

1143
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:28,500
Wouldn't that be nice if your digital library would just spill onto the Switch?

1144
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,660
You could play it in vertical and have the two screens.

1145
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:32,860
That's not going to happen.

1146
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,220
So does Nintendo.

1147
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,540
And again, I don't like to think it's because they're assholes, but.

1148
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,460
Then somebody's got to give me to tell me what it is.

1149
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,020
The emulation isn't working right or something.

1150
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,580
I don't know.

1151
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,340
Nintendo is also not above putting out emulators that don't work completely.

1152
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,220
And we've seen that before and we'll see that again, I'm sure.

1153
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:01,340
Sjoan Hunter Matt in chat says, Nintendo doesn't understand game preservation and it's really sad.

1154
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:06,620
Mike Deff says, Harmonite and a horse game with cards that was developed by Game Freak.

1155
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:06,980
Yeah.

1156
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:13,460
Dejirama S says, it would be nice if they put out a 3DS adapter kit to play 3DS games on docked Switch consoles.

1157
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,540
God, I wish.

1158
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,340
I wish.

1159
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:21,980
Especially from a company that used to do things like the Game Boy Advance player for the GameCube.

1160
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,340
How badass was that?

1161
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,900
And then when you could like hook everything together and.

1162
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,980
Or just make something like the PlayStation TV.

1163
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,220
Yeah, I know.

1164
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,620
I know.

1165
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,660
Well, of course, that didn't end up working out in the long run either, now did it?

1166
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,020
Yeah, it didn't.

1167
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,420
But that's because I don't think the Vita was like super.

1168
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:44,140
I mean, I guess the Vita is somewhat popular, but like, yeah, it was just.

1169
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:52,740
I don't know, it was kind of unfortunate that that didn't work out because that's it's a pretty awesome device for the cost.

1170
00:59:52,940 --> 01:00:04,500
Now, talking about game preservation, it's been brought up that the Wii U doesn't have the Netflix style system that the Switch does.

1171
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,420
You bought games a la carte then.

1172
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:13,140
And even though I seem to recall when the Wii U is out, many of us were saying Nintendo should switch to a Netflix system.

1173
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,380
They have.

1174
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:24,900
But I think because unfortunately, the Netflix has not been as vast of a library as people would have thought because of licensing issues and a lot of the third party developers kind of doing their own things.

1175
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:40,460
Now people are clamoring for the releases that were on the Wii U, because let's be real, there were things that were on the Wii U, especially from companies like Konami and stuff that don't exist on the Switch Online library.

1176
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:49,100
And Nintendo basically said, we don't have any plans to make this accessible on the Switch or anything like that.

1177
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,420
They're just kind of pushing the Switch Online library.

1178
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,540
And as far as the retro virtual console titles.

1179
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,980
That's it, you better grab them while you still can on the Wii U.

1180
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:16,220
I do think this news was very interestingly timed when the two biggest obvious ones, Earthbound and Earthbound Beginnings, if those hadn't made it to Switch yet, Twitter wouldn't have shut up about anything else, I guarantee it.

1181
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:25,860
But because it's interesting that those two come over and then the very next week we're shutting it down and people still have things to complain about.

1182
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:37,180
The Internet will always have things to complain about, but those two, if they were still missing, would have been a huge, huge deal because Earthbound Beginnings, its first go was on the Wii U.

1183
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:45,700
Some people are thinking it might be about the 10th anniversary of the system and Dark Sakura just unlocked the secret there.

1184
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:50,420
Because I don't have the audio turned off on my on my phone.

1185
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:50,980
There you go.

1186
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,860
The audio is a mess tonight anyway.

1187
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:53,420
Sorry, guys.

1188
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,460
We'll work on it through the next week.

1189
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,500
Some people are texting me.

1190
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,740
I'm like, why are you texting me?

1191
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,460
That's fine.

1192
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,540
I have Discord notifications from earlier.

1193
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:00,580
What can you do?

1194
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:11,020
But anyway, they basically were waiting for the Wii U to turn 10 years old, which I didn't realize the Wii U turns 10 years old in November.

1195
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,420
So this all will happen.

1196
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,980
The shutdown will be after the Wii U's 10 year anniversary, which is wild to me.

1197
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:25,340
An ex Nintendo employee said Nintendo knows it has to support a product for a minimum of 10 years or they risk some class action.

1198
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:33,140
I feel like there's companies that support things a lot shorter than that, and they don't face any type of class action.

1199
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:44,060
Like a lot of the mobile phones, Apple, you know, and a lot of those companies, Samsung, they're usually applauded for how long they do last.

1200
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,500
But it's not usually more than six or seven years.

1201
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,060
So it's interesting that Nintendo puts the line at 10.

1202
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,300
So but not that I'm complaining.

1203
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,620
It's just interesting.

1204
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:57,780
That's all. The Wii U sold 13.5 million units in its lifetime.

1205
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:00,940
The 3DS, 75.7 million.

1206
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,660
By the way, the Video Game History Foundation put out a tweet about all this.

1207
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:13,700
While it is unfortunate that people won't be able to purchase digital 3DS or Wii U games anymore, we understand the business reality that went into this decision.

1208
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:21,060
What we don't understand is what path Nintendo expects its fans to take should they wish to play these games in the future.

1209
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:32,700
As a paying member of the Entertainment Software Association, Nintendo actively funds lobbying that prevents even libraries from being able to provide legal access to these games.

1210
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:43,100
Not providing commercial access is understandable, but preventing institutional work to preserve these titles on top of that is actively destructive to the video game history.

1211
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:52,580
We encourage ESA members like Nintendo to rethink their position on this issue and work with existing institutions to find a solution.

1212
01:03:52,900 --> 01:04:02,220
A very tactful message from the Video Game History Foundation, because in my mind, I'm just waving a pirate flag all around going, I know how I'm going to fix the problem.

1213
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:10,260
Hey, if Nintendo gives us something legit, I am more than happy to support it. I really am.

1214
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:23,180
But until then, Arr matey, like yo ho ho, I want to play some of those 3DS exclusive download games that, you know, I don't even know my 3DS's battery works anymore.

1215
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,620
It probably does. I haven't played it in a while.

1216
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:34,340
ZenMonkey11 says, nice way to show thanks to your Wii U day one buyers, Nintendo, shutting them down on the day they bought it.

1217
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:40,300
Well, it's 10 and a half years after the fact, to be fair.

1218
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,140
But hey, you know what is interesting?

1219
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:55,540
I bet the value of a Wii U is really high right now because you can also play like, my Wii is worthless because I transferred all of my Wii titles to my Wii U at some point.

1220
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,980
So my Wii U's got everything on it.

1221
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:02,380
So anyway, we'll see.

1222
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,180
We'll see what develops on that front.

1223
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:12,220
And if Nintendo ever decides to do something about embracing archive and emulation and all that stuff.

1224
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,980
Meanwhile, Dark Siren.

1225
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,060
I don't have a lot of hopes for Nintendo.

1226
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:17,380
I'm going to be perfectly honest.

1227
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:17,980
I don't either.

1228
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:21,580
I mean, hope is, is.

1229
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:23,220
Yeah.

1230
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:28,900
I hope they're making considerations for their next system, if nothing else, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

1231
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,180
No, I wouldn't either.

1232
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,140
You know, you need it to breathe anyway.

1233
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:35,700
So.

1234
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:44,620
Speaking of some other bad news, Nvidia reported that they were, quote, completely compromised by a cyber attack.

1235
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:52,740
They said that their business was taken offline for a couple of days because of a malicious network intrusion.

1236
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:59,940
It affected everything from email to developer tools that had already been suffering outages.

1237
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:03,860
They don't know if anything has been stolen or deleted.

1238
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:10,860
If anything has affected the customers either, but it's, it's pretty bad.

1239
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,660
They're doing a full investigation right now.

1240
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,380
They don't have any really anything to share.

1241
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:29,020
They're a cybersecurity, actually, there's a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey named Alan Woodward that is saying that Nvidia's likely shut down their internal systems to minimize a risk of further damage.

1242
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:35,340
That, you know, better to keep the system completely down rather than have anything keep poking at it, you know.

1243
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:52,500
And I mean, they, they've already been attacked before there was a, a list of 100 or so, actually more than 100s of games, unannounced games that were data mined from GeForce Now, some of which that have been announced.

1244
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:59,380
And of course, as people are want, they want to see is Russia involved and so far, they don't have any links.

1245
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,420
I think the opposite is going on.

1246
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:07,500
We're hearing about and I don't know how much of it but like anonymous is apparently attacking Russian stuff.

1247
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:12,340
It's very, very fascinating to watch the drama on Twitter and other social media.

1248
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:22,140
But anyway, we don't love to see game companies get attacked, but I feel like at the same time it comes with the territory, if there's an exploit, somebody's going to exploit it.

1249
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:31,220
Questbuster in chat says, if I recall correctly, there was an update to this that suggested they did a reverse hack and encrypted the terabyte of data that was stolen.

1250
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,220
Interesting.

1251
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:36,140
I've never, I've never heard of that.

1252
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:37,140
No take backsies.

1253
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,140
That's interesting.

1254
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,140
That's a loud follow up.

1255
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,140
All right.

1256
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:48,140
So Steam Decks are starting to go out and we're starting to see a lot of press reviews of those.

1257
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:53,140
I have yet to hold one in my hand, but we're getting a lot of Steam news in the past few days.

1258
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,140
I feel like because of like a lot of Gabe interviews are showing up.

1259
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,140
Right, Loki?

1260
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,140
We lose Loki.

1261
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,140
Hi.

1262
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,140
Hi, Loki.

1263
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,140
Are we to you or are we back to me?

1264
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,140
I'm sorry.

1265
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,140
No, I think we're back to me.

1266
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,140
So let's talk about games pass.

1267
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,140
So the PC version of games pass there.

1268
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:31,140
There was a comment from Valve basically or Gabe Newell, I think actually was talking about it, but basically that Valve would be open to having games pass, at least the PC version of it available on Steam.

1269
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:37,140
I don't think it's something we think ourselves or we need to do ourselves building a subscription service at this time.

1270
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:43,140
But for their customers is clearly a popular option, and we'd be more than happy to work with them to get that on Steam.

1271
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,140
Perfect.

1272
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:45,140
Awesome.

1273
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,140
To me, I don't know.

1274
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:52,140
Like, it's it'd be nice to have everything kind of in one one spot, but it's not a deal breaker concern.

1275
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,140
It's a PC.

1276
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:56,140
You know, it's just kind of like, you know, it's not a deal breaker.

1277
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:02,140
You know, I open another app instead to download games pass games, but it would be cool to see that integrated.

1278
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:06,140
Maybe that is something that they can do, especially since Microsoft's pretty keen on putting their games on Steam.

1279
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:09,140
So I'm not sure what Microsoft gets out of that.

1280
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,140
But at the same time, yeah, Microsoft's been putting their games on Steam.

1281
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,140
People have been buying them.

1282
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:19,140
We talked about the whole there's too many launchers and now the weak ones like Bethesda's launcher are starting to fall out.

1283
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:22,140
So I guess in that regard, it does make sense.

1284
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:26,140
But it does also still feel a little bit like I don't know if they need it.

1285
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:29,140
But I'm also not using game pass on PC a lot.

1286
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:32,140
I use it, but I don't use it a lot.

1287
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:36,140
So maybe just because I have the occasional onesie twosie game, it doesn't quite feel the same.

1288
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,140
I don't know.

1289
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:44,140
Yeah, I haven't really been utilizing it too much, but it would be cool, though, like just to have everything in one place.

1290
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:54,140
It would be cool, though, like just to have everything in one, you know, library, at least try to consolidate those libraries, because it does kind of sucks like, you know, OK, I want to play this game.

1291
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:57,140
Which library do I have it in, you know, type of thing.

1292
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:00,140
It would be kind of cool.

1293
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:03,140
I mean, at least they're open to it.

1294
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:08,140
So that's something it might push, you know, epic to be open to it as well.

1295
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:11,140
That would be interesting.

1296
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,140
All right.

1297
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:21,140
We'll see what develops with that, especially with the Steam Deck now being a player, being able to get, you know, game pass games on that would be pretty exciting.

1298
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,140
SG100Matt says they don't need it yet.

1299
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,140
I'm not sure the Epic Game Store is hurting Steam yet.

1300
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,140
If they really wanted to one up the Epic Store, then maybe.

1301
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,140
It is interesting, though.

1302
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:41,140
It is interesting, though, I feel like we're getting a flurry of Valve news over the weekend because of the Steam Deck's release and, you know, all that.

1303
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:47,140
So I think there was, well, Gabe Newell did like an interview with PC Gamer about a different bunch of stuff, too.

1304
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:53,140
So and I think they also have I don't know if they have like a livestream or some sort of event or something like that.

1305
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:57,140
But like I know there is a bunch of news, yeah, from Valve as well.

1306
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:03,140
SheHulk10 in chat says Steam should come to console Xbox Series X.

1307
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,140
That would be interesting.

1308
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:08,140
But you've got to think we've got to go in the wayback machine.

1309
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,140
We've got to go way back.

1310
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:18,140
But you may recall on the PlayStation 3 when Portal 2 was released, Valve had Steam built into that.

1311
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:25,140
Most people forgot it because the PlayStation hack happened like not even a month later.

1312
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:31,140
And I think most people got through Portal 2 by the time the PlayStation Network came back online.

1313
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:36,140
But Steam has been baked into a console that wasn't in the orange box.

1314
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:41,140
But the orange box might have been too soon because that was the 360 in PlayStation 2 era?

1315
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,140
Yeah.

1316
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,140
No, was it the PlayStation 3?

1317
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,140
No, it was PlayStation 3.

1318
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:47,140
Yeah, so okay.

1319
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,140
But Steam wasn't baked into that yet.

1320
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,140
But they did bake it into Portal 2.

1321
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,140
So we have seen Steam on a console.

1322
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:57,140
So that would be interesting and maybe something that Steam could leverage to get out of that.

1323
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,140
But we'll see. We'll see.

1324
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:02,140
Digirama S says doesn't Gabe hate Microsoft?

1325
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,140
Did you hear what we were just talking about?

1326
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,140
Apparently not.

1327
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,140
Maybe not.

1328
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,140
Didn't they have Microsoft games on Steam?

1329
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:12,140
On Steam, I don't think that they hate.

1330
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:14,140
I don't see why he would hate them.

1331
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:15,140
No, I don't either.

1332
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,140
Especially because they all run in the same town.

1333
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:21,140
Gabe is going to see the Microsoft people at parties and industry things.

1334
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,140
I think hate is a strong word.

1335
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,140
So, yeah.

1336
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,140
All right.

1337
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:34,140
Let's talk about a pair of retro stories having to do with the Nintendo Switch and some retro updates.

1338
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:37,140
One of them is the Taito Milestones Collection.

1339
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:40,140
That is going to be becoming a series.

1340
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:46,140
It was announced for the Switch in Japan, and it's going to have 10 classic Taito arcade games in it.

1341
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:56,140
Alpine Ski, Jack and Pop, Elevator Action, The Fairyland Story, Frontline, Haley's Comet, The Ninja Warriors, Kix, Space Seeker, and Wild Western.

1342
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:59,140
Yeah, that was the only one you were listening for, right?

1343
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:02,140
But that's just going to be the first of several.

1344
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:06,140
There will be more Taito arcade games in the future, so that's pretty cool.

1345
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:09,140
Hamster is putting this together, and I believe they do.

1346
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:15,140
Hamster publishes the arcade archives, I think.

1347
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:19,140
I'm not crossing my wires there, so I'm sure there will be more.

1348
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:26,140
Yeah, Taito has done those classic collections before, so it's about time we got them on the Switch.

1349
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:34,140
This is more, I guess, retro adjacent, but let's talk about Tempest 4000, shall we?

1350
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:38,140
Because Tempest 4000 is coming out on the Nintendo Switch.

1351
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:42,140
It's going to be out on the Switch starting March 22nd, available in the eShop.

1352
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:49,140
It is the, I guess, follow-up of sorts to Tempest 2000. I thought there was a 3000 at one point, though.

1353
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,140
There was. It was a Jaguar one.

1354
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,140
That's right, okay.

1355
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:58,140
But Tempest 4000 is coming, and that is already available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

1356
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:03,140
So you may have already played this, but it will be coming out on the Switch on March 22nd as well.

1357
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:12,140
So a retro title there, if that is your thing, which I know we are very into retro here at Orange Lounge Radio, right?

1358
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,140
Oh, yeah.

1359
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:17,140
In fact, we love retro so much, we have a weekly segment that we dedicate to it.

1360
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:36,140
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1361
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:39,140
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1362
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:42,140
And Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game tonight?

1363
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,140
I picked Metroid Fusion.

1364
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:53,140
So Metroid Fusion, first of all, came out in 2002 in North America, November 17th.

1365
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:59,140
And actually it came out here before it came out in Japan, which was February 14th, 2003.

1366
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:03,140
It didn't come out in China until March 2nd, 2006.

1367
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:09,140
But this is an action-adventure game published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance.

1368
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:12,140
It was developed by Nintendo R&D.

1369
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:16,140
It also is the same group that did Super Metroid.

1370
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:23,140
And you are playing as Samus Aran, who is fighting against these parasites known as X.

1371
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:27,140
So it's a lot more, you know, typical Metroid stuff.

1372
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:35,140
You know, it's jumping and running from things and shooting things and, you know, spin dashes and all of that.

1373
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:39,140
You can also play this...

1374
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:42,140
It actually was released the day after Metroid Prime came out.

1375
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:49,140
And you can link the games via the GameCube Game Boy Advance link cable for extra content for Metroid Prime.

1376
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,140
It was really good.

1377
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:59,140
It was a little bit shorter than Super Metroid, but it had all the great control, music, graphics.

1378
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:07,140
It was very well received, and it also included a handheld game of the year at the 2002 Interactive Achievement Awards.

1379
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:11,140
It just got many, many positives.

1380
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:16,140
And of course, Metroid Dread, the last one that was out on Switch, is a direct sequel.

1381
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:32,140
So the big thing with this one is that Samus has this parasite that she's going against and finds that the parasites will replicate their host's appearance.

1382
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:49,140
And basically, eventually, she has to fight a version of herself that has been stalking her around, the SA-X, and it looks like her.

1383
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,140
And then, of course, there's some Metroids involved.

1384
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:58,140
I don't want to... Well, okay, I'm going to go ahead and spoil it because it's been out for freaking ever.

1385
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:04,140
The animals that you save at the end of Super Metroid save you.

1386
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:08,140
Always save the animals. They come back to save your ass.

1387
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:17,140
But anyway, going a bit more into the story about this is that Nintendo confirmed a GBA Metroid game in 2001.

1388
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:24,140
Ken Lobb, which is Nintendo of America's director of game development, confirmed that it was a new game, not a port.

1389
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:33,140
And they showed footage at 2001 E3 under the name of Metroid 4, and it had Samus in a dark suit, running on walls and ceilings.

1390
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:37,140
It was more simple, a little more Game Boy color-like.

1391
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:44,140
And then, of course, it had all been updated as of EA E3 2002.

1392
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:52,140
It was... I mean, basically, it mimics Super Metroid being designed by the two team.

1393
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:56,140
It was also the first 2D Metroid game that had animated cutscenes.

1394
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:05,140
And it was written and directed by Sakamoto Yoshio, who was the series' designer.

1395
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:12,140
So it was just... The big thing is that they wanted to do a very original story for it.

1396
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:18,140
They wanted to do something that people hadn't played before, even though it was just a previous Metroid game.

1397
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:25,140
So they altered the story and they put in the idea of the parasites.

1398
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:28,140
I mean, it is not an easy game, I'll tell you that right now.

1399
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:40,140
But at any rate, for all of the cutscenes, the music needed to fit the dialogue.

1400
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:47,140
And so that's why the music is a little bit more serious and ambient rather than melodic.

1401
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:51,140
Because it needed to be something that would go in with this.

1402
01:18:52,140 --> 01:19:05,140
They wanted to look for voice actors, but really the only voices that were used was announcements for ROM cartridge limitations.

1403
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:11,140
So the game did come out November 18th, 2002. August 22nd, 2002.

1404
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:16,140
Nintendo announced that it would be able to connect to Metroid Prime on GameCube.

1405
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:26,140
And there's also a two-disc soundtrack album, which is the Prime Infusion original soundtracks done by Skitron.

1406
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:31,140
And it had also some arranged tracks on there, which was really nice.

1407
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:39,140
It was re-released for Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console as part of the 3DS Ambassadors program.

1408
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:43,140
It was one of ten Game Boy Advance games that was included.

1409
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:55,140
And then Iwata himself actually revealed that Metroid Fusion was going to be among the first three Game Boy Advance games to be released on the Wii U Virtual Console.

1410
01:19:55,140 --> 01:20:02,140
At any rate, like I said, it's been super, super well received.

1411
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:05,140
Famitsu gave it a 34 out of 40. Pretty good.

1412
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:11,140
Everywhere else it's like 10 out of 10, 9 out of 10, 8 out of 10, 88%.

1413
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:17,140
I think the lowest score on this is roughly an 85%.

1414
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:23,140
Metacritic gave it a 92 out of 100. Game rankings is 91.23%.

1415
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:27,140
It's been considered, like I said, the Handheld Game of the Year.

1416
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:38,140
It was chosen as Best Game Boy Adventure game by IGN, Best Action Game on the Game Boy Advance by GameSpot.

1417
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:44,140
It was runner-up for GameSpot's Best Sound, Best Graphics, Best Story, and overall Game of the Year.

1418
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:50,140
As far as sales go, it has sold over 1.6 million units worldwide in its debut week.

1419
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:59,140
It sold more than 100,000 units in North America and finished November with 199,723 copies sold in the U.S. alone.

1420
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:11,140
Total revenue was $5,590,768 and it made it the third best selling Game Boy Advance game that month and 10th best over all gaming platforms.

1421
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:18,140
It went on to sell 940,000 copies by August of 2006.

1422
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:21,140
Revenue is exceeding $27 million.

1423
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:36,140
As of 2006 in America, it was the 21st highest selling game for any of the present handheld systems at that time, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, or PSP.

1424
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:42,140
It's actually sold quite well in Japan as well as in 2004. It sold 180,000 units in Japan.

1425
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:52,140
And then, of course, like I said, it has a sequel. Metroid Dread is this game's direct sequel developed by Nintendo and Mercury Steam.

1426
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,140
And that's it.

1427
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:01,140
For sure.

1428
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,140
There you go.

1429
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:30,140
Yeah, let's talk about the free with your subscription games you can get through PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold.

1430
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:41,140
So with PlayStation Plus, we're going to be getting Ark Survival Evolved, Team Sonic Racing and Ghosts of Tsushima Legends on PlayStation 4.

1431
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:49,140
And then on PlayStation 5, Ghost Runner and then Ghosts of Tsushima Legends as well there.

1432
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:57,140
And then, of course, let's see the Xbox games with gold.

1433
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:09,140
We're going to be getting looks like the Flame in the Flood and Sacred 2 Fallen Angel, Street Power Soccer and SpongeBob's Truth or Square.

1434
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:14,140
And those are the games that are available through that service as well.

1435
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:23,140
I actually I've been forgetting to download these games or mark them in my catalog, especially with Game Pass and stuff.

1436
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:27,140
It's kind of out of the way, especially if you're not on console to do that.

1437
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:30,140
You have to go to the Xbox store and stuff.

1438
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:35,140
And I just want to say a quick before you get to the next story, a quick sorry for the unexpected silence there.

1439
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,140
I was hard muted through OBS.

1440
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:40,140
You got you guys could hear me on Discord and that's why the show kept moving.

1441
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,140
But the listeners were like, you're muted, you're muted.

1442
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:46,140
And that's just one of those things we're getting used to with the new space.

1443
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,140
Sorry, y'all. We'll get there.

1444
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:55,140
And then out of the blue, there's a new Portal game sort of coming out.

1445
01:23:55,140 --> 01:24:00,140
So Aperture Death Job is a simulator game that's being put out.

1446
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:02,140
I thought you said Aperture Death Job.

1447
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,140
And I was like, oh, exciting.

1448
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:05,140
No, no, Death Job.

1449
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,140
And that's coming out for free on March 1st.

1450
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:15,140
And it's made, I think, for the Steam Deck.

1451
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:21,140
They made it for that, but I'm assuming that you can play it on other things as well.

1452
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:28,140
Curious, though, I'm wondering if this is just a thing to kind of promote the Steam Deck

1453
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:35,140
or if this is like a teaser for a Portal 3 type of thing, like an ARG or something.

1454
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:40,140
But I guess we will have to find out once it comes out March 1st.

1455
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:42,140
Don't tease me like that.

1456
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:43,140
But I hope so.

1457
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:45,140
It looks silly either way.

1458
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:46,140
Yeah.

1459
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,140
Be a fun one to stream.

1460
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:50,140
Dark Soccer.

1461
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:55,140
So I got everything hidden by my camera is the problem.

1462
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:57,140
Let me respond to Bobby real quick.

1463
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:58,140
Sorry.

1464
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,140
Saying they stated it was just a tech demo.

1465
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:03,140
You mean GLaDOS might lie to us?

1466
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:07,140
Sorry, Jamie.

1467
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,140
Uh-huh.

1468
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:16,140
Anyway, so Nintendo Switch Online has fixed Ocarina of Time's water temple room

1469
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:19,140
and the Paper Mario wot crash.

1470
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:25,140
So the I'm losing like every window in front of me.

1471
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:32,140
The fix actually went live.

1472
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:35,140
I apologize.

1473
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:38,140
I'm actually having 50,000.

1474
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:41,140
I was having 50,000 things open at the same time.

1475
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:43,140
I clicked the wrong thing.

1476
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:46,140
I can see your screen flashing so I can tell something crazy is going on.

1477
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,140
Yeah, no, I clicked something.

1478
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:51,140
And I don't know what it was so sorry about it.

1479
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:58,140
Anyway, they also have added Majora's Mask as a new game.

1480
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:01,140
And like I said, fixed those other things.

1481
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:08,140
They've also made sure that they also did other improvements of Ocarina of Time

1482
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:10,140
as far as its playability.

1483
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,140
Other news.

1484
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,140
And this one I'm pretty excited about.

1485
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:17,140
Now I have backed this game.

1486
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,140
I am looking forward to it.

1487
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:23,140
Called Drag Her, which is a drag queen fighting game.

1488
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:27,140
And they just got Ben DiLaCreme for it.

1489
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,140
And that makes me happy.

1490
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:31,140
The little teaser is so funny.

1491
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:36,140
The computer's like, are you going to quit in the middle of the competition?

1492
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:38,140
Only if I'm winning.

1493
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:40,140
That was pretty great.

1494
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:45,140
But yeah, some of the other ones like it has Tammy Brown in it and Jiggly.

1495
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:49,140
And who else did I see in there?

1496
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,140
Oh, Kimchi.

1497
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,140
Alaska was in there, right?

1498
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,140
Alaska, yeah.

1499
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:56,140
Any non-Drag Race drag queens or is they pretty much relying on that franchise

1500
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:59,140
to help bring the visibility to the game?

1501
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:02,140
Well, I think honestly this is the best way to get visibility for it

1502
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:07,140
is to focus on the big names that everyone knows.

1503
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,140
Oh, guess who else actually?

1504
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,140
Landon Thider is in it.

1505
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:11,140
Okay, that's cool.

1506
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:13,140
Okay, so a Dragula, a king in it.

1507
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:14,140
That's cool.

1508
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:15,140
Okay.

1509
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:18,140
So I think that's really awesome because, I mean, Landon Thider,

1510
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:23,140
having seen him perform, super talented king there.

1511
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:24,140
Yeah.

1512
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:25,140
Cool.

1513
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:26,140
Yeah.

1514
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,140
All right.

1515
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:29,140
Pretty cool about that.

1516
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:30,140
All right.

1517
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:33,140
And with that, we're going to travel around the world and check out some games

1518
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:37,140
you can play a little sooner than drag queen fighting games,

1519
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:39,140
as much as I know you're looking forward to that, Loki.

1520
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:40,140
Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.?

1521
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:42,140
I am very much looking forward to that.

1522
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,140
You got to try it at least once.

1523
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:49,140
Well, you know, not the drag queen fighting games, but there's that.

1524
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:52,140
I don't know if it's a drag queen game, but that that.

1525
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:57,140
Oh, God, it's it's a FPS game that's done like the style of like Doom,

1526
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:01,140
but it's like you're making people fabulous, like putting clothes on them

1527
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,140
or something. You have a clothes gun.

1528
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,140
So there's that.

1529
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:05,140
I don't remember that.

1530
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,140
Yeah.

1531
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:07,140
Yes, a five shooter.

1532
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,140
What is something like that?

1533
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:09,140
Yeah, like I can't remember.

1534
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:11,140
I swear I've had it.

1535
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,140
I've had it.

1536
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:14,140
I think they actually have that.

1537
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:16,140
But I think I actually had that to work.

1538
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:17,140
I don't know what this game is.

1539
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:19,140
Jack, get to work.

1540
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:21,140
I had it in my background for a while.

1541
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:24,140
I can I could tell you what the game is because I have it on my steam wish list,

1542
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:32,140
but it is.

1543
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,140
Fashion police squad.

1544
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:35,140
That sounds awesome.

1545
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:36,140
Yes.

1546
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:37,140
Yes.

1547
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,140
It's coming out sometime this year.

1548
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:43,140
OK, so something we can do here now

1549
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,140
that I couldn't do before.

1550
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:47,140
So this is and this is something on steam.

1551
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:48,140
Yes.

1552
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:50,140
OK. Oh, my gosh.

1553
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:51,140
What the heck is this?

1554
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:52,140
OK, let's see.

1555
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:56,140
So I'm going to I'm going to fast forward here and then we're going to do that.

1556
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:59,140
And you do see them cut out for just a minute.

1557
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:02,140
But now I can actually see the game.

1558
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:05,140
OK, so

1559
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,140
so sorry.

1560
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:09,140
This does not make great for podcast.

1561
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,140
So it's definitely what Loki was describing.

1562
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:16,140
It's a first person shooter and it looks like it's very pixelated.

1563
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:18,140
Oh, the fashion police dispatch.

1564
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,140
We have this is Officer Dez.

1565
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:23,140
There's a thin red ribbon blocking my way to the crime scene.

1566
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:24,140
This is ridiculous.

1567
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:25,140
I love it.

1568
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:26,140
I have to check that out.

1569
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:27,140
That's funny.

1570
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:28,140
All right.

1571
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:32,140
And yes, I and hopefully I can make that work a little smoother in the future,

1572
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,140
but I can actually do drop in YouTube's now.

1573
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,140
So that'll be fun.

1574
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:37,140
Yeah, that's awesome.

1575
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:40,140
Anyways, so back to release dates, though.

1576
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:46,140
So this week we've got Guild Wars two end of dragons coming out on PC.

1577
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:49,140
LX two.

1578
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:51,140
And did I just show my.

1579
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:54,140
Or are you like to.

1580
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:59,140
That's on a PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series

1581
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:05,140
far the changing tides on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1582
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:10,140
Shadow Warrior three on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1583
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:16,140
Babylon's fall on PC, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

1584
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:19,140
And then, of course, the big ones for the week.

1585
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:26,140
Gran Turismo seven on PlayStation four and PlayStation five and triangle strategy on Nintendo Switch.

1586
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:30,140
Why is triangle man now playing in my head?

1587
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:35,140
Because I said trying the things a triangle can.

1588
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:36,140
Sorry.

1589
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,140
Sorry for the chaos.

1590
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,140
I'm sure that I was trying to particle man.

1591
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:42,140
My discord notifications are coming through on stream, so I was trying to mute those.

1592
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:44,140
So you guys wouldn't hear those about that.

1593
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,140
Put yourself in the stream mode.

1594
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,140
Yeah.

1595
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,140
And then I end up showing.

1596
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:54,140
Thank God my phone number is mostly blocked out because it just totally not to shine a light on it, but it totally did.

1597
01:30:54,140 --> 01:31:03,140
So anyway, let's move on to Japan and talk about the releases there this week in Japan.

1598
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:05,140
We also have triangle strategy getting released there.

1599
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:07,140
That's pretty cool.

1600
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,140
And that is pretty much the big release on the Nintendo Switch.

1601
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:11,140
There's not a lot else to look forward to on the switch.

1602
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:19,140
But if you go to the PlayStation five, we also have Babylon's fall, which is coming out there and Gran Turismo seven, kind of a big deal.

1603
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,140
And the rotten city is coming out on the PlayStation five as well.

1604
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:26,140
So busy week in Japan, dark Sakura.

1605
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:27,140
How about the UK?

1606
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:31,140
It's not super busy, but busy ish on the first.

1607
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:39,140
We have Alex to on console for PlayStation, Xbox and PC.

1608
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:44,140
We have on the third Babylon's fall for PlayStation on the fourth.

1609
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,140
We have a lot more.

1610
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:48,140
We have Gran Turismo seven.

1611
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:54,140
We have triangle strategy for Switch Ryan's rescue squad for the big three.

1612
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:58,140
We have Ash Walker's for Switch, which actually looks kind of cool.

1613
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:02,140
We have Death's Gambit afterlife also on Switch.

1614
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:06,140
And that is it for that week.

1615
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,140
All right.

1616
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:13,140
Just a few more stories for you, and then we're going to get to the listener roundtable and see how that goes tonight with this new setup.

1617
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:14,140
We'll see.

1618
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:16,140
I don't even have a scene for discord.

1619
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,140
I'll have to build one on the fly.

1620
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:18,140
We'll see how that goes.

1621
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:21,140
Meanwhile, though, we will get to our next story.

1622
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:22,140
Loki.

1623
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:31,140
Yeah, so there's news regarding Call of Duty, and that is that there's not going to be a Call of Duty in 2023.

1624
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:34,140
They're going to be taken a year off.

1625
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:42,140
It's probably not so much that they're well, obviously, you know, they need some time to, you know, kind of work on the game.

1626
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:46,140
It's not like that they're not going to be doing any Call of Duty content during that time.

1627
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:50,140
They're actually going to be working on more of the Warzone stuff.

1628
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:59,140
So there'll be stuff being done through their free to play game, but no mainline Call of Duty game that's going to be coming out in 2023.

1629
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:03,140
So they'll be skipping that.

1630
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:04,140
And then what else?

1631
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:13,140
So also to go along with the unfortunate Activision news.

1632
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:31,140
So the Call of Duty executives, I guess, or the Activision Blizzard folks, there is filings within the SEC that withheld some important information regarding the money that they're going to be getting from the merger.

1633
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:40,140
So it sounds like that there's some of these execs are just trying to stay around for six to eight months after the deal goes through.

1634
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:49,140
And they're going to get millions of dollars for, you know, some of these folks haven't even been tenured for a year or so.

1635
01:33:49,140 --> 01:34:08,140
But you know, for example, they've got their chief financial officer is getting $25.3 million, their chief operating officer $29 million, the administration officer 11.3 billion and legal officer $14.7 million.

1636
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:13,140
And of course, Bobby Kotick is receiving quite a bit as well.

1637
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:14,140
How convenient.

1638
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:15,140
$20 million.

1639
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,140
Yeah.

1640
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:17,140
God.

1641
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:32,140
So basically, yeah, so the SEC filing, it alleges that the deal is better for Activision Blizzard executives and board members than it is for the average investor.

1642
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:33,140
Which, yeah, I agree.

1643
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:39,140
You know, because when I if I buy stock in Activision, I'm like getting $20 million.

1644
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:43,140
So already not as good as what I should be getting.

1645
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:44,140
All right.

1646
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:46,140
I need some news that's a little bit happier.

1647
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:49,140
Dark Soccer, if you could entertain me in that department, please.

1648
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:50,140
So something better news.

1649
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:52,140
Oh, yeah, totally better news.

1650
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:57,140
This will better except for one way my wallet.

1651
01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:00,140
So, yeah, because this ain't cheap.

1652
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:04,140
And you didn't get those bonuses that Loki was just talking about.

1653
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:05,140
Oh, God.

1654
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:08,140
So let me just go go on this.

1655
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:14,140
So Multimorphic has announced they are doing Weird Al's Museum of Natural Hilarity.

1656
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:15,140
I am stoked.

1657
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:18,140
Like, Dan woke me up and told me about this.

1658
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:28,140
OK, so at any rate, it is going to be on the P3 system.

1659
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:38,140
Which what P3 is, it's a modular a modular pinball table with a LCD screen underneath

1660
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:39,140
it.

1661
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:41,140
So you have interactive elements with the play field.

1662
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:42,140
It looks really cool.

1663
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,140
Yeah, they're really cool.

1664
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:47,140
Well, I've played two of the games on there.

1665
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:52,140
I played Lexi Lightspeed and I played whatever that second one came out was.

1666
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:56,140
There's another one called Heist that's supposed to be a lot better than the other two, although

1667
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:58,140
I really enjoyed Lexi Lightspeed.

1668
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:05,140
But this is going to be the fourth in that series, as far as I'm aware.

1669
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:12,140
And I mean, I really am just like completely stoked about it.

1670
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:18,140
They got out, of course, to do all the voices, all the call outs, everything about it.

1671
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:25,140
I am absolutely just completely, completely, completely floored by this.

1672
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:35,140
And then also, you know, there's going to be a deluxe version of this that's going

1673
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:38,140
to have an animated topper on it.

1674
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,140
That looks awesome.

1675
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,140
Yeah, well, we are going to get that one.

1676
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:42,140
So that's the thing.

1677
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:43,140
We are we are going to get that.

1678
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:57,140
And the thing is, is that, OK, so the base P3 machine costs about $8,300.

1679
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:06,140
The module for Weird Al's Museum of Natural Hilarity is $3,000.

1680
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:14,140
The limited edition package is an additional $1,800.

1681
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:20,140
So we are looking at roughly $14,000 for this pinball.

1682
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:21,140
It's a car.

1683
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:22,140
Roughly.

1684
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:23,140
It's a car.

1685
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,140
It's amazing.

1686
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:26,140
That's hardly a car?

1687
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,140
A used car.

1688
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:33,140
That's buying a Yaris.

1689
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,140
Game not.

1690
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:44,140
Anyway, they also have other little upgrades, which we're also considering doing.

1691
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:48,140
We want to get the enhanced flipper assembly.

1692
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:54,140
We want to get all of the other major upgrades.

1693
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:59,140
And I'm actually even kind of thinking about asking for Lexi light speed as well.

1694
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:03,140
But we would probably just keep it permanently as Weird Al.

1695
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:11,140
The orders for it are, are they already up or are they going up on the fourth?

1696
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:13,140
I think they're going up on the fourth.

1697
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,140
I'm actually going through the thing.

1698
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,140
Yeah, I'm not seeing the date on it.

1699
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:29,140
But like the song list has Amish Paradise, Like a Surgeon, My Balona, White Nerdy, Word Crimes, Dare to be Stupid, Germs, Fun Zone, Hardware Store, Harvey the Wonder Hamster.

1700
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:33,140
And by the way, Harvey the Wonder Hamster is on his hamster wheel in the game.

1701
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,140
It's awesome.

1702
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:42,140
El Sousa, Mission Statement, Sports Song, Traffic Jam, Weasel Stomping Day, UHF, and You Make Me.

1703
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:44,140
UHF, there's a UHF mode in it.

1704
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:49,140
Okay, for those who do not know, UHF is very important to my marriage.

1705
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:51,140
Do you know why?

1706
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:54,140
Because of the reception you drank from the fire hose.

1707
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:57,140
No, but we did find the marble in the oatmeal.

1708
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:06,140
Anyway, when Dan and I got engaged, we were watching UHF on VHS.

1709
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,140
No, I take that back. It was on DVD.

1710
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:10,140
We were watching UHF.

1711
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:19,140
We were drinking Manischewitz blackberry wine and cheap French bread and spinach dip from the grocery store.

1712
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:21,140
We were broke as a joke back in those days.

1713
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:24,140
But then we were like, you can get married.

1714
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:26,140
Sure, eventually.

1715
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:28,140
That was exactly how the proposal went.

1716
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:32,140
I don't really remember who told who what, but we just decided.

1717
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:34,140
Very romantic.

1718
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:43,140
But years later, for our 10th anniversary, we went to see Weird Al with the mandatory fun tour.

1719
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:47,140
We had front row seats and everything.

1720
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:51,140
We brought him our DVD copy of UHF.

1721
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:53,140
He signed it.

1722
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:56,140
We told him the story.

1723
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,140
And he's like, and you haven't divorced yet?

1724
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:06,140
It was really cool.

1725
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:08,140
Al is a sweetheart in person.

1726
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:13,140
I'm very, very, very happy that something like this has come along.

1727
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:18,140
I never expected a Weird Al pinball table.

1728
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:20,140
Never in a million.

1729
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:25,140
I'm so intensely pleased that all thoughts of Rush have left my head.

1730
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:31,140
Sorry, I love Rush, but Weird Al has a very special place in this household.

1731
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:33,140
Very special place.

1732
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:40,140
What are your thoughts on the documentary that they're putting together with Daniel Radcliffe playing Weird Al?

1733
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:42,140
That's not a documentary, Loki.

1734
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:47,140
It's a mockumentary, I guess.

1735
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:52,140
A biopic is usually what you would call this, yeah.

1736
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:55,140
I don't know.

1737
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:57,140
Probably very silly.

1738
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:59,140
Everything should be very silly.

1739
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:00,140
I can't wait.

1740
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:02,140
We have so much Weird Al stuff.

1741
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:09,140
Not like hyper collectors, but I have a copy on VHS, because it's the only way you can get it, of the complete Al.

1742
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:13,140
As in spelled Z-O-M-P-L-E-A-T.

1743
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:22,140
We've got box sets, I've got mandatory fun on vinyl autographed playing cards from the tour.

1744
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:27,140
And we got our tour shirts and everything.

1745
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:34,140
We were hoping that, well actually for our 15th anniversary, we were going to go to New Orleans.

1746
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:39,140
And we said if we couldn't go to New Orleans, we'd go to another Weird Al thing, but COVID.

1747
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:42,140
So we got iPads instead.

1748
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:57,140
But anyway, going back to that, there's going to be a showing of it at the Texas Pinball Festival in Frisco, Texas, March 25th through 27th.

1749
01:41:57,140 --> 01:42:02,140
And if anybody goes to that, oh my god, just play it.

1750
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:13,140
I want to see if Pina Gogo or the Golden State Pinball Fair that we do here that Dan and I work at, if they can get it.

1751
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:22,140
Because we get Stern and Jersey Jack to display tables, so maybe we can get Multimorphic to come.

1752
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:24,140
That'd be awesome.

1753
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:25,140
Awesome.

1754
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,140
I'm so excited.

1755
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:29,140
This has never happened during OLR.

1756
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:35,140
Maybe I can hope I don't show too much mess, but I'm going to pan down a little bit.

1757
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:38,140
This has never, never happened.

1758
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:40,140
Oh, he just, and now he's decided he's over.

1759
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:42,140
He knew the camera.

1760
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:44,140
He knew the camera was on him.

1761
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,140
It's on the VOD.

1762
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:46,140
Fuck it.

1763
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:47,140
I'm leaving.

1764
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:48,140
Clip it.

1765
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:50,140
Clip it.

1766
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:51,140
Okay.

1767
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:55,140
That has never, ever happened during OLR.

1768
01:42:55,140 --> 01:43:04,140
I'm glad of the delay because I unpaused the internet version and I got to see it.

1769
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:07,140
And I was just a second short of screenshotting it.

1770
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:08,140
What a little asshole.

1771
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:09,140
Look at this.

1772
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:10,140
Look at this.

1773
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:11,140
He did all that.

1774
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:12,140
Oh, damn it.

1775
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:13,140
I can't.

1776
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:14,140
Sorry.

1777
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:15,140
My place is still a mess.

1778
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:16,140
Don't judge me.

1779
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:17,140
It's all right.

1780
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:18,140
You just moved.

1781
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:19,140
He's lying down.

1782
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:20,140
I do this.

1783
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:21,140
He's just lying down, passed out.

1784
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:22,140
Do you see him?

1785
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:24,140
Do you see him being a drama queen over there?

1786
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:25,140
Yeah, I see him.

1787
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:31,140
He just decided to go lie down right over there just to be a fucking drama queen.

1788
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:33,140
And now I'm not going to get my shot back the way it was.

1789
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:34,140
All right.

1790
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:38,140
I have so many pictures of other people's animals from streams.

1791
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:42,140
Mostly I have pictures of Losing Colors dog, Odin.

1792
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:44,140
But I'm mildly obsessed with Odin.

1793
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:47,140
I can never touch a husky due to allergies.

1794
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:49,140
But I'm obsessed with that dog.

1795
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:53,140
So I'm so excited for Alan to start streaming because he actually set his up.

1796
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:56,140
So the cat bed is on there.

1797
01:43:56,140 --> 01:44:00,140
So he's ready for a cat cam for when smush goes in there.

1798
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:01,140
So we'll see.

1799
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:02,140
We'll see.

1800
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:08,140
I'm actually considering doing the same if I had an extra port to do it with is Midna

1801
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:13,140
no longer will sleep on the chair behind me, but she sleeps in my work chair.

1802
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:19,140
And I put a white towel down on the chair behind me so that Midna would show up on camera.

1803
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:20,140
So.

1804
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:28,140
The best game ready for the best getting rig ready for stream scene that I saw on YouTube

1805
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:35,140
by Willie Mosbin had his cat licking a plexiglass like it was like a transparent plexiglass

1806
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:37,140
thing with cat food on it.

1807
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:40,140
And that that was his like getting ready for stream thing.

1808
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:42,140
It was amazing.

1809
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:43,140
That's fantastic.

1810
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,140
That's great.

1811
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:48,140
The one thing that sadly isn't coming through on stream so well and I just it's a lighting

1812
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:50,140
thing, but you can probably see behind me.

1813
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:55,140
I actually have orange lights in here, but it just needs to get lit up better.

1814
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:57,140
I need to figure out how to make kind of red.

1815
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:59,140
Yeah, that's right on.

1816
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:01,140
Well, they and they change colors.

1817
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:05,140
So you can actually I think if I just hit the change colors, you could actually have

1818
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:06,140
a difference.

1819
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:07,140
That's red.

1820
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:08,140
So there's a little more.

1821
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:12,140
I have two color changing bars, but the only place that I could put them was on the opposite

1822
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:14,140
side of my camera.

1823
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:15,140
So.

1824
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:21,140
But you know what, you know what I would suggest doing are those hexagon lights.

1825
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:23,140
Oh, that'll be cool.

1826
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:24,140
We'll see.

1827
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:25,140
We'll see on the back wall.

1828
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:30,140
I wanted to do like lights that you could change on Twitch when I'm streaming, but we'll

1829
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:31,140
see.

1830
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:32,140
We'll see.

1831
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:33,140
Sorry.

1832
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:34,140
Talk to me.

1833
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:36,140
I found a place to get some of those bulbs cheap.

1834
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:37,140
And thank you.

1835
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:38,140
I see the clips coming in.

1836
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:39,140
Yeah.

1837
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:40,140
I'll look at those later.

1838
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:43,140
Plus, I want to show them to Alan, so be funny.

1839
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:44,140
All right.

1840
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:45,140
Let's move on.

1841
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:46,140
We still have some more stories.

1842
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:49,140
I think one more from Loki.

1843
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:54,140
Right, Loki?

1844
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:55,140
Yeah.

1845
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:56,140
Sorry.

1846
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:57,140
I was checking out the camera.

1847
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,140
Oh, you're watching the clip.

1848
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:59,140
I understand.

1849
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:00,140
I understand.

1850
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:01,140
And we'll take the podcast.

1851
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:03,140
Folks, go over to twitch.tv slash vlog network.

1852
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:07,140
And now there's a clip there of two of them actually about Smoosh in the new studio.

1853
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:10,140
So I'm downloading it, by the way, so I can send it to you.

1854
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:12,140
Oh, it's something you can watch.

1855
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:19,140
Unlike watching Super Smash Brothers at Evo this year, because it's not going to be there,

1856
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:20,140
unfortunately.

1857
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:27,140
Nintendo has decided this year that they are not going to be including Super Smash Brothers

1858
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:29,140
in Evo.

1859
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:36,140
And apparently that they're hoping to be able to, you know, work with them again soon.

1860
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:40,140
I don't know if this is because Evo was purchased by Sony.

1861
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:44,140
And so maybe there's like some kind of, you know, confusion there.

1862
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:48,140
It's probably something behind the scenes, some sort of like arrangement that's going

1863
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:52,140
on, that maybe it was more favorable for Sony than Nintendo.

1864
01:46:52,140 --> 01:47:00,140
But for whatever reason, I want to say just like since that story was published, like

1865
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:05,140
Nintendo has come out and talking about their own plans for Smash and that whole thing.

1866
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:09,140
I don't know if that was somebody reporting on an earlier tweet or what, but I want to

1867
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:12,140
say like multiple tournaments, like I agree.

1868
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:13,140
I agree with you.

1869
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:14,140
It's it's silly.

1870
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:17,140
And I don't I don't think Sony's the one stopping it, though.

1871
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:18,140
I really don't.

1872
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,140
Just because they knew what they were buying.

1873
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:24,140
And I don't see what they have to gain from that happening.

1874
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:28,140
And I guess we can have a hand Nickelodeon All-Stars Brawl there.

1875
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:29,140
Right.

1876
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:30,140
I guess.

1877
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:32,140
Who knows what's going to replace it?

1878
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:35,140
That would be really funny, though.

1879
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:36,140
All right.

1880
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:39,140
And one more story for you guys tonight.

1881
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:43,140
And I thought this was funny because we just talked about this on the show two weeks ago,

1882
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:44,140
maybe three.

1883
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:48,140
But we had talked about, hey, what did what did that guy from that made the Nestle emulator?

1884
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:49,140
What did he end up doing?

1885
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:50,140
Right.

1886
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:53,140
And we had found out, oh, he went to work for EA and he was working on some of those

1887
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:59,140
things because there was a GitHub thing about the emulator that was buried away.

1888
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:01,140
So he had like a super Nestle that he'd written.

1889
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:04,140
And basically that code was in an EA game on the GameCube.

1890
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:05,140
Right.

1891
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:06,140
And it was buried away from a few weeks ago.

1892
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:07,140
Yeah.

1893
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:13,140
Well, I guess this guy is suddenly getting like exposure all over again, because what's

1894
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:20,140
interesting is that on GitHub, he has now released a new NES emulator.

1895
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:25,140
And as pointed out in our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, the NES has

1896
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:28,140
been emulated pretty perfectly at this point.

1897
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:29,140
Right.

1898
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:33,140
Emulators have come a long way since Nestle in the late 90s, early aughts.

1899
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:37,140
Like the emulators are in a really good place now when it comes to the NES.

1900
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:40,140
Here's what makes this one really interesting.

1901
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:46,140
It's a transistor emulator, so it emulates down to the transistors.

1902
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:52,140
It only runs on OS X right now, which I also think is kind of hardcore, but that's that's

1903
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:53,140
what they're doing.

1904
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:56,140
And that would be, by the way, OS X.

1905
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:57,140
Sorry.

1906
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:06,140
But they're saying also it's efforts involved with Visual 2 CO2 and Visual 2 AOC3.

1907
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:10,140
Actually, something bothers me because we're technically not on OS X anymore.

1908
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:12,140
We're like on OS 12.

1909
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:17,140
I assumed that was the other old ass operating system, not Mac.

1910
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:19,140
I thought it was the actual OS.

1911
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:20,140
What did they call that?

1912
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:22,140
I thought it was called OS X.

1913
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:24,140
No, it was Mac OS X.

1914
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:25,140
No, no, no.

1915
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:26,140
I'm not talking about a Mac system.

1916
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:27,140
I'm talking about a...

1917
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:30,140
Well, I don't think it's Linux.

1918
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:33,140
Am I going crazy?

1919
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:34,140
Yeah.

1920
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:37,140
No, it's OS X, Mac OS X.

1921
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:38,140
Okay.

1922
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:41,140
I thought there was something.

1923
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:43,140
My brain is mixing it up with something else.

1924
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:44,140
But okay.

1925
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:45,140
Yeah.

1926
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:49,140
So for whatever reason, that is the platform it's running on now.

1927
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:52,140
It must be what he has access to, or maybe he just has a really...

1928
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:54,140
Was I thinking of OS X?

1929
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:55,140
I guess I was.

1930
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:56,140
I was thinking of OS 2.

1931
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:57,140
You might have been thinking of OS 2.

1932
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:58,140
I was thinking of OS 2.

1933
01:49:58,140 --> 01:49:59,140
I sure was.

1934
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:01,140
And I was like, damn, that's hardcore.

1935
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:02,140
Okay.

1936
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:03,140
There we go.

1937
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:04,140
That is it.

1938
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:05,140
It's OS 2 I was thinking of.

1939
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:08,140
I think the last OS X was two years ago.

1940
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,140
Okay.

1941
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:13,140
So anyway, it's running at the transistor level, which is pretty wild.

1942
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:16,140
And yeah, you could check that out if you want.

1943
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:21,140
And some folks in a Reddit thread about this are pointing out, transistor level emulation,

1944
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:26,140
that is like 100% software emulation without emulating quantum effects.

1945
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:27,140
It's almost perfect.

1946
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:31,140
Of course, it takes more system resources, but you want to talk about perfect emulation.

1947
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:32,140
There you go.

1948
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,140
So this is still probably early on, but it's interesting.

1949
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:36,140
He put it on GitHub.

1950
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:39,140
So who knows what we're going to see come from this.

1951
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:41,140
It's very exciting.

1952
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:50,140
So just when we thought NES emulation was perfect, it's going to get more perfect.

1953
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:52,140
All right.

1954
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:56,140
Anyhow, that is the last story that we had on the agenda tonight.

1955
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:59,140
But there's always what you guys have to talk about.

1956
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:00,140
The listener round table.

1957
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:02,140
If you guys want to, you can try to call.

1958
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:07,140
I'll try to make that happen over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1959
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:09,140
And then of course we have our mailbag.

1960
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:11,140
I don't know if we've gotten anything in the past two weeks.

1961
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,140
I have to check with...

1962
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:13,140
No.

1963
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:14,140
We got spam.

1964
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:15,140
I deleted it.

1965
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:17,140
I have a last minute story.

1966
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:18,140
I think some of it was in Dutch.

1967
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:19,140
We'll get to that.

1968
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:24,140
But participate at orangesontrader.com if you want to send us emails for a future week.

1969
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:27,140
Usually when we don't get emails, we talk about Drag Race.

1970
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:31,140
But the only thing I have to say that's Drag Race related is tangina heels.

1971
01:51:31,140 --> 01:51:33,140
End of sentence.

1972
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:34,140
All right.

1973
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:37,140
The icon, the legend, and the moment.

1974
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:39,140
Loki, you had a last minute story.

1975
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:40,140
Why don't we get to that?

1976
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:44,140
So Konami, being the geniuses that they are...

1977
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,140
Oh, shit.

1978
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:49,140
They forgot to renew the domain for silenthill.com.

1979
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:52,140
And it got snatched up by somebody else.

1980
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:58,140
And now if you go to silenthill.com, there is a screenshot of a tweet from Masahiro Ito

1981
01:51:58,140 --> 01:52:02,140
saying, I wish I hadn't decided effing Pyramid Ed.

1982
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:03,140
Wow.

1983
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:04,140
That's it.

1984
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,140
That is beautiful.

1985
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:07,140
That is...

1986
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:09,140
I'm putting this on my Twitter right now.

1987
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:12,140
That is something else.

1988
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:13,140
Huh.

1989
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:16,140
Are they going to hold it ransom or something?

1990
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:20,140
Or is it just like a fuck Konami type of thing or that sort of situation?

1991
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:21,140
I don't know.

1992
01:52:21,140 --> 01:52:23,140
Apparently they did the same thing in 2019 too.

1993
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:29,140
They let it lapse for a second and forgot to renew it.

1994
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:36,140
Because there's also a screenshot of a tweet from some guy named Bob Vids on Twitter.

1995
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:38,140
It says, so silenthill.com domain is available.

1996
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:41,140
And that was from December 6, 2019.

1997
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:43,140
That's fricking hilarious.

1998
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:44,140
Yeah.

1999
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:45,140
All right.

2000
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:47,140
No Konami.

2001
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:49,140
Oh boy.

2002
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:55,140
So anything else we want to talk about here before we move to wrap up tonight?

2003
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:56,140
I feel like it's early.

2004
01:52:56,140 --> 01:52:58,140
We haven't even really been on air two hours, but...

2005
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,140
It is.

2006
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:02,140
Like I'm normally...

2007
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:03,140
Wow.

2008
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:04,140
I know, right?

2009
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:06,140
We could touch on some of the other headlines from last week.

2010
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:07,140
Let me go...

2011
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:09,140
Yeah, what happened?

2012
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:10,140
There was some other stuff too.

2013
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:11,140
We can...

2014
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:12,140
Unless you already have it up, Loki.

2015
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:13,140
I'll pull up the...

2016
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:14,140
I'm working on it.

2017
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:15,140
Behind the scenes.

2018
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:19,140
I don't know why y'all posted stories because you knew there wasn't a show last week, but

2019
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:20,140
both of you...

2020
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:21,140
I forgot.

2021
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:22,140
I didn't.

2022
01:53:22,140 --> 01:53:23,140
It's a force of habit.

2023
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:24,140
Oh no, I know you did.

2024
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:25,140
I'm sorry.

2025
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:26,140
I meant in the thread there was that.

2026
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:28,140
Which I don't have access to anymore.

2027
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:30,140
No, it's a force of habit.

2028
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:31,140
So that's why I did it.

2029
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:32,140
No, it's all good.

2030
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:33,140
It's fine.

2031
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:34,140
I'm not actually...

2032
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:36,140
Yeah, I can cover some of the stuff that was in there.

2033
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:37,140
I do have it up.

2034
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:38,140
I do have it up.

2035
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:44,140
Let's see, the first season of Chocobo GP is going to be free for full game players

2036
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:45,140
and has Cloud and Squall in it.

2037
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:49,140
I'm still interested in Chocobo GP, but the whole season thing and some of that free to

2038
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:52,140
play stuff is really worrying.

2039
01:53:52,140 --> 01:53:55,140
Puzzle and Dragons came out for Nintendo Switch.

2040
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:56,140
That's cool.

2041
01:53:56,140 --> 01:53:57,140
I didn't even...

2042
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:58,140
That wasn't on my radar.

2043
01:53:58,140 --> 01:53:59,140
That's pretty rad.

2044
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:03,140
Super Metroid got a new save point near the end of the game.

2045
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:04,140
What?

2046
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:05,140
Thank God.

2047
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:06,140
No, it's the...

2048
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:11,140
You know how they do that in the Nintendo online app and stuff like that where they

2049
01:54:11,140 --> 01:54:16,140
have those special modes that you can play that's kind of a save state?

2050
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:17,140
It's that.

2051
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:18,140
Oh, it's just SP.

2052
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:19,140
Okay.

2053
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:20,140
I thought...

2054
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:21,140
Yeah, the SP.

2055
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:22,140
What?

2056
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:23,140
They added...

2057
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:24,140
Okay, I get it.

2058
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:25,140
I get it.

2059
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:26,140
Okay, cool.

2060
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:27,140
That's still neat.

2061
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:28,140
Those SP releases are cute.

2062
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:31,140
It allows you to do things that you probably can't do anymore, but you were able to do

2063
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:32,140
it as a kid.

2064
01:54:32,140 --> 01:54:37,640
That's me in that Kid Icarus SP that lets you play the last level that's like a shooter.

2065
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:38,640
What the fuck?

2066
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:39,640
Out of nowhere.

2067
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:41,340
The last level is a shooter level.

2068
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:44,660
You can play that now because me trying to actually beat that game in this day and age,

2069
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:46,380
very difficult.

2070
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:47,380
Very difficult.

2071
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,380
In this economy?

2072
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:50,260
In this economy.

2073
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:53,500
It was confirmed that NFTs are not coming out to Final Fantasy XIV.

2074
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:56,140
I thought that had come up two weeks ago, but it's in the list here.

2075
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:57,420
Oh, Dark Sakura.

2076
01:54:57,420 --> 01:54:58,420
I know.

2077
01:54:58,420 --> 01:55:01,060
The reveal of Sadako from Reimu.

2078
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:04,380
Did we talk about that two weeks ago?

2079
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:05,380
Was the PTB out at that time?

2080
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:06,380
I don't know if the PTB was out.

2081
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:10,740
The PTB came out that Tuesday, so we got all the talents and all that came out.

2082
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:11,740
That's what it was.

2083
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:12,740
That's right.

2084
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:16,660
We found out the survivor is the child grown up, which is interesting.

2085
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:17,660
Yoichi.

2086
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:21,060
Yeah, it was not the character or anything there.

2087
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:22,860
Which was Reiko's son.

2088
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:24,860
Pretty cool.

2089
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:35,220
Yeah, I love the aesthetic of Sadako on the test realm.

2090
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:38,460
Just the way they did her was great.

2091
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:40,460
She seems like she's going to have some issues as a killer.

2092
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:45,860
She's definitely not going to be S tier, but I think a niche killer can be really fun.

2093
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:55,440
Did you happen to see the render rips that I did?

2094
01:55:55,440 --> 01:56:05,080
I know I put them out on my Discord, but they were talking about wondering just how short

2095
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:06,300
she was.

2096
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:12,340
Because right now, the two shortest killers in the game, before Sadako comes out, is Pig

2097
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:13,980
and Hag.

2098
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:18,980
And Pig is about 5'3".

2099
01:56:18,980 --> 01:56:21,780
And I'll find a link to it and put it somewhere.

2100
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:28,700
But when I ripped the renders and had them all side by side, because I figured out how

2101
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:35,260
to do that now, Sadako is about a whole head shorter than Pig.

2102
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:39,300
And the only reason that Hag looks short at all is because she's hunched.

2103
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:42,980
But when you import her model, she's standing up straight.

2104
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:49,420
And we know that that is coming to the full game in early March or something like that,

2105
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:50,420
right?

2106
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:51,420
8th.

2107
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:56,900
All right, Loki, what else did you have that you want to talk about from last week?

2108
01:56:56,900 --> 01:57:02,340
So there's going to be a new LEGO set for Horizon Forbidden West's Tallneck.

2109
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:04,140
They're going to do that, which is kind of cool.

2110
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:10,020
They have an official set that will be coming out in May.

2111
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:13,820
I believe the 22nd, which is weird, though, because usually they're at the beginning of

2112
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:15,620
the month, but OK.

2113
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:16,620
So sometime in May.

2114
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:19,780
That's going to come out, and it'll be about $80.

2115
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:23,140
I am very interested in that.

2116
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:24,140
What else?

2117
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:25,140
No Man's Sky got another update.

2118
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:26,140
It did.

2119
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:27,140
It's a combat one.

2120
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:30,900
I've watched Alan play a little bit of it.

2121
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,660
I have not played it myself yet.

2122
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:39,940
I've been so busy with eight years of old house collection, unloading it.

2123
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:41,980
But it's crazy.

2124
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:44,140
If you guys saw that house today, you'd be like, what?

2125
01:57:44,140 --> 01:57:47,180
You lived here?

2126
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:52,860
So I don't know if this is tied in with the new Pokemon games that were just announced,

2127
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:59,620
but in Pokemon Legends ArcSis, there was someone that did a free cam in that game, and they

2128
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:05,040
were able to find a present day room that was unused, I guess.

2129
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:08,980
It's like a bedroom that has a Nintendo Switch and a TV and stuff like that, which is kind

2130
01:58:09,020 --> 01:58:14,220
of odd in feudal Japan, but it's there.

2131
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:18,820
My thought is they were going to use that in the opening sequence to render that in

2132
01:58:18,820 --> 01:58:25,620
the engine, because if I remember right, you are in the modern times, and then you fall

2133
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:29,980
through a void type of thing, and that's how you end up in...

2134
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:35,180
It might just be that they put it in a weird spot that they never thought anybody would

2135
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:36,180
find.

2136
01:58:36,180 --> 01:58:37,180
Probably.

2137
01:58:37,180 --> 01:58:38,180
Yeah.

2138
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:46,140
EA executives are blaming Halo and COVID for the fact that Battlefield 2042 didn't do well.

2139
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:51,460
Not because the game is completely buggy and pretty much unplayable, but sure.

2140
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:55,420
And then, of course, they came out and said, oh, no, no, no, we didn't do that, because

2141
01:58:55,420 --> 01:58:59,500
it was an internal meeting, comments that were leaked out.

2142
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:05,580
Speaking of leaks, Halo Infinite, the Forge mode has leaked out from that, or at least

2143
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:11,860
some screenshots, so apparently that's coming, or video, I guess they have video for it,

2144
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:14,260
so that's something that's on its way.

2145
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:22,620
And then there's a Bioshock film that's in the works at Netflix, so I'm down with that,

2146
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:27,460
and then Sonic the Hedgehog is getting a third film and a Knuckles live-action series.

2147
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:30,260
Oh, I missed the news about the series.

2148
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:31,260
That's interesting.

2149
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:33,260
Yeah, on Paramount Plus.

2150
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:40,460
Will the series plug into the movie to make a super media experience?

2151
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:41,460
I don't know.

2152
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:42,460
Have to ask.

2153
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:43,460
Maybe.

2154
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:44,460
Have to ask.

2155
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:45,460
That's it.

2156
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:46,460
I had.

2157
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:52,100
Mike Defton-Chad is talking about the modern stuff that was found in Pokemon Legends, saying

2158
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:57,580
it seems like an unused asset, but it's also rumored to be something for a future DLC.

2159
01:59:57,580 --> 01:59:58,580
Yeah.

2160
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:05,540
Sonic Cinematic Universe, hey, you put that with Detective Pikachu, the upcoming Mario

2161
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:06,540
movie.

2162
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:07,540
What else do we got?

2163
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:12,700
We got a Smash Brothers universe building, is my point, so just, you know, we'll see.

2164
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:18,660
And Mike Defton-Chad says Sonic 3 and Knuckles, but separate this time instead of together,

2165
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:22,500
which is kind of funny, so very cool.

2166
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:26,380
All right, yeah.

2167
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:27,900
You guys in chat are funny.

2168
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:31,980
All right, well, I guess with that, we're going to wrap up the show.

2169
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:35,420
We're a little early, but that's, you know, some weeks the show moves a little faster

2170
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:37,060
than others.

2171
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:40,100
Thank you guys for listening to our show this week, whether it was on the podcast feed or

2172
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:42,780
whether you were here live with us on Twitch.

2173
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:44,220
Really appreciate you guys being here.

2174
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:46,860
Thank you for bearing with us through some of the sound issues.

2175
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:49,260
I have some things to work on this week for sure.

2176
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:53,320
Not only do I want to decorate a little more behind me, which might dampen some of the

2177
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:56,440
echoing that you're hearing, but it sounds like I might need to switch out the mic, which

2178
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:57,440
is a bummer.

2179
02:00:57,480 --> 02:01:01,040
I really thought this would be a better quality, not a worse one.

2180
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:06,480
But I'll play with that and see what we can do behind the scenes about that.

2181
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:09,640
And yeah, thank you very much for being here and supporting the show.

2182
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:12,120
If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend or two about the show.

2183
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:14,960
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

2184
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:20,360
need more voices here to put out on air, that's for sure, and would always appreciate that.

2185
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:24,400
And yeah, a nice five-star review wherever you found this podcast, whether it's iTunes,

2186
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:29,000
Spotify, Google, whatever it is you listen to podcasts on, super appreciate that.

2187
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:34,080
And of course, follows and all that good stuff for VOG Network over on Twitch, twitch.tv

2188
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:37,520
slash V-O-G network.

2189
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:39,920
That is going to do it for tonight.

2190
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,600
Dark Sakura, I will throw it to you.

2191
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:46,040
I imagine you are off to play Debbie Delight post-show or something.

2192
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:47,680
You said you were kind of getting burned out on Debbie.

2193
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:49,440
Are you going to play something else?

2194
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:52,200
I'm still going to do Debbie.

2195
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:57,000
Of course, you know, I just need a little bit of prep time because we're done far earlier

2196
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,600
than I expected to be.

2197
02:01:58,600 --> 02:01:59,600
So yeah.

2198
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:00,600
All right.

2199
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:03,600
Well, have a good night.

2200
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:06,160
Have fun killing, and we'll see you next week.

2201
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:07,160
Bye-bye.

2202
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:08,160
Everyone be well.

2203
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:09,160
Be kind.

2204
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:10,160
All right.

2205
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:13,320
Loki, what is your final thought for us tonight?

2206
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:16,120
I've got a lot of work to do in Minecraft.

2207
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:19,600
I got to do a lot of planning because I've been spending this week doing development

2208
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:23,320
of that data pack, which put me behind.

2209
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:26,380
So I got to get creative now.

2210
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:33,560
My final thought is this has been a very expensive past couple of weeks, but it feels so, so

2211
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:34,560
nice to be here.

2212
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,200
Loki, you've got to come over at some point.

2213
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,300
Same thing goes for Dark Sakura.

2214
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:41,840
We were planning an Ikea trip last week, but then we realized Ikea closed an hour earlier

2215
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:42,840
than we thought.

2216
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:46,320
So she didn't end up coming out here, but I'm not saying you and I have to go to Ikea,

2217
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,840
but I do want you to see the new place at some point.

2218
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:49,840
Yeah, definitely.

2219
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:50,840
It's nice.

2220
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:53,000
I'm upstairs now, which is weird.

2221
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,280
The old house was not upstairs, downstairs.

2222
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:56,360
This one is.

2223
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:58,880
So it's a little funky, but I like it.

2224
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:03,320
And there is, I'm just saying, I'm not saying that I planned this space for us to ever be

2225
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:09,480
back in person, but that is a couch behind me and the couch can move to the other wall.

2226
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:11,480
There are things that could be done.

2227
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:12,480
We'll see.

2228
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:13,480
Someday, someday.

2229
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:14,480
All right.

2230
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:16,320
For now, we're all done here.

2231
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:21,680
Thank you all so much for being here and supporting Orange Lounge Radio for 904 weeks or one week,

2232
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:23,680
however long you've been with the show.

2233
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:24,680
Appreciate you.

2234
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:25,780
Happy gaming.

2235
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:27,320
Stay safe out there.

2236
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:33,560
And again, thoughts for all the Ukrainian people out there and everything the folks

2237
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:35,120
in Ukraine are going through.

2238
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:37,800
Just, y'all are in my thoughts.

2239
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:38,800
Stay safe.

2240
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:39,800
Have a great week, everybody.

2241
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,440
We will see you next time.

2242
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,440
Good night.
