00:00.000 --> 00:13.200
The software publisher Laundry Landscape has been flowing for years.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.800
God Galaxy, Epic Games Store, Battle.net, a few among the many.

00:16.800 --> 00:20.640
The landscape is ebbing just a touch with Bethesda choosing to close up their direct

00:20.640 --> 00:23.160
storefront shop and move their library back to Steam.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.520
Consolidation in action, business in motion, time ticks on.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.520
P.S.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.520
Fuck war.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.720
This is my standout story.

00:29.720 --> 00:33.040
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:33.040 --> 00:35.960
this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where Every

00:35.960 --> 00:36.960
Gamer Has a Voice

00:36.960 --> 00:48.400
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:48.400 --> 00:50.840
where Every Gamer Has a Voice.

00:50.840 --> 00:58.840
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again for episode number 904 of our show.

00:58.840 --> 01:04.120
For tonight, February the 27th of 2022.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.820
My name is Rob Roberts.

01:05.820 --> 01:08.960
Do not adjust your TV sets over here at Twitch.tv.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.280
Yes, it looks different tonight because as we've been hyping up on the show for the last

01:13.280 --> 01:15.120
few weeks, I've moved.

01:15.120 --> 01:20.520
I'm in a brand new location and yeah, we just did a minor facelift on some things to accommodate

01:20.520 --> 01:21.720
for that.

01:21.720 --> 01:28.400
At the same bandwidth, same token, some things might be off that they were before.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.720
I'm understanding my audio might be a little bit echoey.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.000
I've got some things to kind of fix there.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.040
This room is not quite set up completely the way I want it to for the future, but please

01:38.040 --> 01:40.640
bear with us while we work through some of the kinks.

01:40.640 --> 01:45.860
Literally was working on the show up until 15 minutes before we went live tonight.

01:45.860 --> 01:49.960
So there probably will be some things that go wrong as we get used to broadcasting here

01:49.960 --> 01:55.960
from studio number 8 for the show or as I've been calling it studio infinity because as

01:55.960 --> 01:59.720
you know, it's in a virtual environment, so the space is limitless.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.720
And joining me-

02:00.720 --> 02:01.720
So it's not studio Sense8?

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
Yes.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.080
Say hello, hello Dark Sakura as she is always here.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.080
No, it is not studio Sense8.

02:07.080 --> 02:10.080
That was canceled, unfortunately, by Netflix.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.360
And it lives on through us.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.360
Wait.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.360
That's right.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.360
That's right.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.280
It does in a way, or at least it lives on in the Wachowski universe because I believe

02:17.280 --> 02:22.520
a lot of those folks that were acting in that were in the Matrix movie, which I never did

02:22.520 --> 02:23.520
see.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.520
I was-

02:24.520 --> 02:25.520
I need to see the new one.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.560
And of course, we do tape live still as we do every week over at the Voice Geeks Network

02:30.560 --> 02:36.320
twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby

02:36.320 --> 02:38.000
Black Wolf show.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.040
And it was nice to have both of our shows on this week because last week we were off

02:42.040 --> 02:43.360
two weeks ago, Bobby was off.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.440
So we were both here tonight.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.720
And I see you all in chat.

02:46.720 --> 02:47.720
Hello, hello.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.880
Pod Culture saying Sense8 was great.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.880
Had one of my faves in it.

02:50.880 --> 02:51.880
I love Sense8 too.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.140
It was a great show.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.840
I didn't watch the movie.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.840
I still have to get caught up on that.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.440
I will at some point.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.000
Also joining us as he does every week.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Hello.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Hi, Loki.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
How are you?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I'm fine.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Good.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Did you ever watch Sense8?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Were you a fan of that?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
No.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I didn't watch it.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Oh, I actually never watched it either.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I'm just saying.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
What?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
What?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
All right.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.760
If they're already made, you should check it out.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.240
I did at least watch like the first season.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.840
I'm pretty sure I saw the second season too.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.600
It's pretty good.

03:21.600 --> 03:26.000
If you guys do notice like, oh my gosh, the audio is like way off or something, please

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
feel free to holler and chat and I'll do my best to fix it as we go live.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.760
But this is very much a screw it.

03:32.760 --> 03:40.000
We'll do it live tonight because yeah, again, I just got settled into this space not even

03:40.000 --> 03:44.240
a week ago and like got everything set up for OLR just in the past few days.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.680
And today I've been very busy.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.640
It's not just been unpacking with this new place, but it's been trying to get the old

03:49.640 --> 03:52.320
place settled and taken care of as well.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.840
And we purged a lot of shit at the old place.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.600
And yeah, so there's that as well.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.880
So pop culture says you got to dial it in and that takes time.

04:02.880 --> 04:03.880
Well, thank you.

04:03.880 --> 04:04.880
Thank you for understanding.

04:04.880 --> 04:05.880
Appreciate that.

04:05.880 --> 04:06.880
That is for sure.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.360
We'll try to figure out.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.360
Yeah.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.360
All the fun stuff going on.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.360
I expect immediate perfection.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.360
Do you?

04:12.360 --> 04:13.360
No.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.360
From us, no.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.360
Yeah, I know.

04:15.360 --> 04:20.520
It's, it's, it's going to always be a little, a little weird.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.280
That's just a, that's just the way it is here at a OLR.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.280
Yeah.

04:24.280 --> 04:27.800
They're saying that I sound distant, which I wonder if I'm not coming through the webcam,

04:27.800 --> 04:30.680
but I'm supposed to in fact be coming through this mic that's sitting here.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.800
I wonder if somehow that didn't get screwed up at some point, which is certainly, it's

04:34.800 --> 04:37.300
certainly possible.

04:37.300 --> 04:38.300
That's for sure.

04:38.300 --> 04:39.300
But we'll see.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.300
Oh, we'll see.

04:40.300 --> 04:41.300
It says mic default.

04:41.300 --> 04:45.320
Maybe if I, maybe if I do that, don't put it as default, just make the

04:45.320 --> 04:46.320
selection.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.240
I wonder, that's trusting windows and you can never trust windows.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.960
Did that change anything?

04:50.960 --> 04:51.960
I just did.

04:51.960 --> 04:52.960
Maybe.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
Not really.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.960
Oh, dammit.

04:54.960 --> 04:55.960
I thought that might be it.

04:55.960 --> 04:56.960
All right.

04:56.960 --> 04:57.960
Well, that's something I'll have to take a look at a little bit later.

04:57.960 --> 04:58.960
So sorry if I sound a little weird.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.640
Uh, I am using, I would say the weird thing is I'm using the same mic, the wave three

05:02.640 --> 05:07.000
that I use for streaming, or at least I'm supposed to be, which sounds really nice when

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm streaming.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.720
So, um, yeah, I don't know what's going on.

05:09.720 --> 05:13.080
So, um, if worse comes to worse, I still have the old mixing board and mic and I can always

05:13.080 --> 05:14.600
get that all set up again.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.920
Um, and maybe that's just what I'll end up doing.

05:16.920 --> 05:17.920
We'll see.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.880
It's, it's a learning experience here in our new studio, but do y'all like my, do y'all

05:21.880 --> 05:25.600
like my burger time machine that you see behind me here on Twitch?

05:25.600 --> 05:31.520
I'm noticing there's a little bit of a space next to it as well, that a nice little something

05:31.520 --> 05:33.920
something could fit over here.

05:33.920 --> 05:38.040
But what I also don't have set up is I have a ton of amiibo figures and other little things

05:38.040 --> 05:41.400
and trinkets that I want, um, that I want to be using.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.800
And I want that to all be set up as well.

05:43.800 --> 05:48.320
And uh, yeah, so there's also what you guys don't see just off frame.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.840
There's a walk-in closet and I've actually thought about having the arcade machines in

05:52.840 --> 05:54.060
the walk-in closet.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.080
So it's actually like a little walk-in arcade.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.800
Um, that might be kind of fun.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.800
We'll see.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.800
We'll see.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.800
There's still a lot of things to decide.

06:00.800 --> 06:06.280
Anyway, we're going to get into the news, uh, as we do here, let's get into our kickoff

06:06.280 --> 06:07.280
topic tonight.

06:07.280 --> 06:12.240
Uh, a very big, uh, direct that happened this morning, right?

06:12.240 --> 06:14.240
Uh, Loki, maybe you want to start us off here.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.240
Yes.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.480
It's a Pokemon themed.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.480
I don't know.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.920
Was it a direct or was it just like some other thing?

06:19.920 --> 06:20.920
I don't think it was a direct.

06:20.920 --> 06:24.040
It was like, well, today is actually the anniversary of Pokemon.

06:24.040 --> 06:28.680
So today is like the anniversary of the games releasing, uh, the original red and green,

06:28.680 --> 06:29.920
uh, in Japan.

06:29.920 --> 06:32.280
And so, uh, they usually try to do a little something today.

06:32.280 --> 06:35.360
So it was like Pokemon, Pokemon day celebration, if you will.

06:35.400 --> 06:39.360
Uh, Mike Deaf says it's Pokemon presents was the actual name of it.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.360
Uh, yeah.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.360
Pokemon presents?

06:41.360 --> 06:42.360
Sign me up.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.360
Pretty much.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.360
Yeah.

06:44.360 --> 06:50.280
So they had a big announcement, well, lots of announcements actually.

06:50.280 --> 06:55.380
So kind of going down the list here, uh, the biggest one obviously is new mainline entry.

06:55.380 --> 07:02.060
So Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which are coming to Nintendo switch later this year to which

07:02.060 --> 07:03.820
those trailers look pretty cool.

07:03.820 --> 07:05.180
It looks open world.

07:05.180 --> 07:08.180
It looks like Pokemon ArcSIS.

07:08.180 --> 07:11.740
Did we have the B team working on the art for ArcSIS because this looks a lot better

07:11.740 --> 07:12.740
than that.

07:12.740 --> 07:20.940
And if you compare contrast to the game that just came out and it's like, eh, all those

07:20.940 --> 07:25.820
complaints that people were saying about the art style, yeah, kind of valid.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.820
Um, so that's coming out and of course the three starters that they have for that as

07:29.820 --> 07:30.820
well.

07:30.820 --> 07:34.100
Um, which one looks kind of like Donald Duck.

07:34.100 --> 07:40.700
And then, uh, we've got a, it looks like now I'm assuming that this, are they all of

07:40.700 --> 07:44.920
the Alolan Pokemon, but apparently Pokemon goes getting Alolan Pokemon March 1st.

07:44.920 --> 07:51.300
We've already had some Alolan Pokemon as part of different events, but, uh, apparently we're

07:51.300 --> 07:53.580
going to be getting more of them or all of them.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.060
I don't know.

07:55.060 --> 07:56.620
So that's coming very soon.

07:56.620 --> 08:01.540
Pokemon Go tends to run things or roll things out like slowly.

08:01.540 --> 08:06.300
Um, so when they say Alolan Pokemon are coming to Pokemon Go, it'll probably be like the

08:06.300 --> 08:13.940
starters and, uh, maybe some of the, like, really like S or not S tier, but like F tier

08:13.940 --> 08:18.180
kind of Pokemon in that game, you know, the normal types in the first area, uh, that'll

08:18.180 --> 08:20.200
come through, uh, probably won't be a lot.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.980
And then they'll release more throughout the year if it goes by, by like, um, the, the,

08:24.980 --> 08:28.300
uh, like gen five and six and all that did.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.300
Yeah.

08:29.780 --> 08:36.580
Uh, apparently the mobile Pokemon game, um, so I'm assuming they're talking about Pokemon

08:36.580 --> 08:37.580
Go.

08:37.580 --> 08:42.180
Maybe, um, they're saying the Pokemon Dex is expanded to include gen seven editions

08:42.180 --> 08:44.140
from sun and moon.

08:44.140 --> 08:52.700
Um, Pokemon masters, ex ads, victory road and Pokemon cafe remix.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.740
It gets a delivery feature as well.

08:54.740 --> 08:57.540
All these games, I have no idea what they are.

08:57.540 --> 08:59.180
Um, what else?

08:59.180 --> 09:06.220
Uh, Pokemon unite is getting a mayhem mode and let's see brilliant diamond and shining

09:06.220 --> 09:10.460
Pearl are getting shaman.

09:10.460 --> 09:13.200
And I think Arxis had some updates as well.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.900
There's supposed to be a 1.1 version cats or K whatever.

09:16.900 --> 09:17.900
I don't care.

09:17.900 --> 09:18.900
Arxis it Arceus.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.420
I don't know how you pronounce it.

09:20.420 --> 09:23.340
I don't care because they cut corners on their art.

09:23.340 --> 09:27.300
So I'm going to cut corners on the pronunciation.

09:27.300 --> 09:33.180
You can use a code, I guess, to get some free balls in the game.

09:33.180 --> 09:38.980
So our case, Arxis adventure, whatever, however you want to pronounce that, um, if you use

09:38.980 --> 09:45.940
that by March 31st, you get some free pokey balls and they're getting an anime adaptation

09:45.940 --> 09:49.380
of it as well.

09:49.380 --> 09:54.900
And I saw there was like actual DLC or something, but maybe not, maybe it's a bit early for

09:54.900 --> 09:55.900
that.

09:56.500 --> 10:00.700
There's just that patch, which it wasn't clear to me what all is in the patch.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.900
I think it sounds like they're doing, um, like from what I was picking up, like some

10:03.900 --> 10:08.300
of those, um, the, the encounters in the wild where like a ton of them show up, which I

10:08.300 --> 10:09.780
can't remember the name of in the moment.

10:09.780 --> 10:15.180
Um, but there was a whole quest line that I think will show more of those, that more

10:15.180 --> 10:16.280
of those will show up.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.140
So it wasn't DLC, but it's more like, just like a patch basically.

10:19.140 --> 10:22.240
That's going to put more content in the game, massive mass outbreaks.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.780
That's what Mike Deaf says in the chat, uh, outbreaks of alpha Pokemon.

10:25.780 --> 10:29.140
I don't remember that being in the main game and I caught that that was in the trailer.

10:29.140 --> 10:32.100
So I was like, Oh, that was scary.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.100
Yeah.

10:33.100 --> 10:39.060
And then, um, Pokemon sleep, um, nothing like that.

10:39.060 --> 10:40.820
Pokemon sleep forever.

10:40.820 --> 10:41.820
Yeah.

10:41.820 --> 10:45.980
Uh, Mike Deaf says you get multiple outbreaks now instead of one.

10:45.980 --> 10:46.980
Oh, that's good.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.220
Cause the outbreaks are a really good way to catch shinies.

10:49.220 --> 10:52.940
I know that's like the preferred shiny hunting method at this point.

10:52.940 --> 10:57.060
You kind of combine that with having a really complete pokey decks and I think the shiny

10:57.060 --> 11:01.220
charm and you put all that together and it makes the shinies like a lot more obtainable

11:01.220 --> 11:02.220
than they were before.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.220
So yeah.

11:03.220 --> 11:08.740
So yeah, basically what they've done with the new update is they're modeling the outbreaks

11:08.740 --> 11:12.300
of Pokemon based on COVID-19 outbreaks.

11:12.300 --> 11:16.860
And so you'll see a lot more, a lot, a lot more Pokemon now because of that.

11:16.860 --> 11:17.860
I see.

11:17.860 --> 11:18.860
I see.

11:18.860 --> 11:19.860
And it'll fade pretty quick, hopefully.

11:19.860 --> 11:20.860
Yes.

11:20.860 --> 11:21.860
It'll fade pretty quick.

11:21.860 --> 11:25.100
It'll come out and everybody will forget our arcades didn't exist.

11:25.100 --> 11:31.420
For a little while you'll lose your taste and play like bad Pokemon games.

11:31.420 --> 11:34.900
You'll lose your taste for Pokemon and go play Elden Ring for a little while, which

11:34.900 --> 11:37.460
is what it seems like everybody is doing this week.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.080
I have zero interest in that game.

11:39.080 --> 11:42.100
Everybody fucking dropped what they were doing to go play Elden Ring.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.100
Yeah.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.100
Here's the thing.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.400
I'm not super big on Souls games.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.460
I'm not big on George R.R. Martin.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.440
I'm not here to yuck somebody's yum.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.480
My husband loves those soul games, so I'm excited for him.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.440
I've watched people streaming the game.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.440
I get it.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.800
It's just one of those things where I'm like, I just, I got other stuff I need to play right

11:58.800 --> 11:59.800
now.

11:59.800 --> 12:04.480
I won't piss in y'all's cornflakes, but I'll go eat some Froot Loops.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.320
That that part.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
Exactly that.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.320
All right.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.320
So, yeah.

12:09.320 --> 12:13.520
So that was a nice little, again, Gen 9.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.740
I was not expecting that whatsoever for that to come out.

12:16.740 --> 12:17.740
And this year.

12:18.140 --> 12:21.260
I thought like this would have been the Pokemon game of the year and that'd be it.

12:21.260 --> 12:25.420
I would, especially with everything else on the Switch, having getting been pushed back,

12:25.420 --> 12:30.260
I am shocked really that we are getting a new mainline Pokemon game this year.

12:30.260 --> 12:31.260
That is for sure.

12:31.260 --> 12:33.060
So, yeah, that is cool.

12:33.060 --> 12:36.300
I'm really excited to play that at some point.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.300
So let's see.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.700
Dartisia in chat says, oh, my wife got Elden Ring.

12:39.700 --> 12:40.740
I think she's digging it.

12:40.740 --> 12:44.340
I might try it, although I'm knee deep in my second Cyberpunk playthrough.

12:44.340 --> 12:45.580
Let's see.

12:45.580 --> 12:50.500
Fifth Dream says, I've been watching an Australian lady catch all the shinies, then all the alpha

12:50.500 --> 12:51.500
shinies.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
Oh, my God.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.620
That sounds like a nightmare to do that, too.

12:54.620 --> 12:55.620
She's amazing.

12:55.620 --> 12:56.620
Awesome.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.580
Hey, that's like Elden Ring.

12:58.580 --> 13:03.340
I watch people play it and it's fun, but I just don't think the you died, you died, you

13:03.340 --> 13:04.740
died, you died is for me.

13:04.740 --> 13:05.740
I've tried it.

13:05.740 --> 13:07.060
I tried to play the original Demon's Souls.

13:07.060 --> 13:10.460
I tried to play Dark Souls, I think, or one of the other ones.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.820
I tried to play Bloodborne.

13:12.820 --> 13:14.340
I just wasn't feeling it.

13:14.340 --> 13:15.340
Sorry.

13:15.340 --> 13:19.740
Mike Deft in chat says, the new games may be based on Spain or at least in the Mediterranean

13:19.740 --> 13:20.740
Sea area.

13:20.740 --> 13:25.100
Yeah, they haven't said for sure, but the name of one of the Pokémon to me kind of

13:25.100 --> 13:29.780
sounded like, oh, I wonder if that isn't like influenced, like with Spain or something was

13:29.780 --> 13:30.820
kind of interesting.

13:30.820 --> 13:33.420
Which did you guys see the new starter type Pokémon?

13:33.420 --> 13:35.940
I was curious what you guys thought of that.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.500
I didn't bother.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.900
Oh, look them up.

13:38.900 --> 13:42.300
I like the Weed Cat.

13:42.940 --> 13:47.260
There's Weed Kitty, there's Applegator and there's Emoduck.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.740
Emod.

13:49.740 --> 13:51.860
That's what I'm calling him anyway.

13:51.860 --> 13:56.020
Mike Deft says, Springatito and Fuecoco.

13:56.020 --> 14:01.140
Now see, that sounds like what Dark Sakura might actually name a pet, except it would

14:01.140 --> 14:03.940
be FuegoGo, not Fuecoco.

14:03.940 --> 14:05.940
But it's really close.

14:05.940 --> 14:11.140
DJ RomaeF says, it's Kingdom Hearts Donald, not Emoduck.

14:11.140 --> 14:12.420
I think they're all cute.

14:12.420 --> 14:17.500
Like I don't, I have to see what they evolve into, but we'll see.

14:17.500 --> 14:21.860
I don't know if these names sound more, yeah, they definitely do sound Italian, like not

14:21.860 --> 14:30.220
so much Castilian, but more Italian because like Fuecoco, you know, like, I don't know,

14:30.220 --> 14:34.820
that would think that would be more Fiore, Fue would be like related to Spanish, I would

14:34.820 --> 14:35.820
think.

14:35.820 --> 14:46.140
But the, I'm missing the other T in Springatito and I'm wanting to say Springatitio, you know,

14:46.140 --> 14:53.140
so maybe, yeah, I guess they are a little bit more of the Castilian variety.

14:53.140 --> 14:59.220
We're getting a little lesson from Mike Deft in chat, who I know is fluent in Spanish,

14:59.220 --> 15:05.740
saying Gatitio equals little cat in Spanish and Coco equals Coco Drilo, which is also

15:05.740 --> 15:06.740
Spanish.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.740
Interesting.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.240
So, well, we'll see.

15:09.240 --> 15:17.220
My heart hurts that the cat is a grass type and that the fire type looks so freaking ridiculous.

15:17.220 --> 15:18.220
Like I hate it.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.860
I like that he's a cute little alligator.

15:20.860 --> 15:26.300
I might just move on and play, you know, Dewey Duck.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.440
I think a lot of people are going to play Dewey Duck.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.440
That's for sure.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.440
I don't know.

15:30.440 --> 15:36.060
This might be the first time I start with a grass type if I play it because I'll be

15:36.060 --> 15:40.820
honest, the last Pokemon game, I got halfway through it and I was like, this is why I don't

15:40.820 --> 15:41.820
play Pokemon.

15:41.820 --> 15:47.160
That was me with every single Pokemon game until Sword and Shield, which I absolutely

15:47.160 --> 15:48.860
loved and beat.

15:48.860 --> 15:54.780
So I did exactly the same with Sword and Shield as I do with every other Pokemon game.

15:54.780 --> 15:55.780
Exactly the same.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.780
I made it a little bit further in that one.

15:57.780 --> 16:02.860
I actually got like to the fifth gym and then I was like, oh, I'm bored now.

16:02.860 --> 16:04.860
It's just repetitive.

16:04.860 --> 16:05.980
Yeah, I get it.

16:05.980 --> 16:12.240
For me, it's like, oh my God, I feel the need that I have to collect everything in one area.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.620
And that can be very overwhelming.

16:14.620 --> 16:19.580
But with Sword and Shield's very open area, it was, I don't know, it felt a little less

16:19.580 --> 16:20.780
like daunting.

16:20.780 --> 16:24.400
And now that this game is going to be all open area, it sounds like kind of like Arceus

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
a little bit.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.120
It's just still separated into five areas.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.120
Let's be real.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.920
But I'm into it.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.360
I'm really open minded about it.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.360
That's for sure.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.360
Let's see.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.880
Okay, before we get into our gaming weeks, as we usually do towards the top of the show,

16:38.880 --> 16:41.320
I think we have to say something.

16:41.320 --> 16:45.840
I know we play video games to escape some of the dramas of the real world, but I think

16:45.840 --> 16:49.920
we really have to acknowledge what's going on with Putin's invasion of Ukraine right

16:49.920 --> 16:54.840
now, which is obviously an extraordinarily shitty situation.

16:55.680 --> 17:00.320
I know a lot of people are saying it's Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is technically

17:00.320 --> 17:01.320
accurate.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.880
But I know there's a lot of Russian people that aren't happy about it either.

17:03.880 --> 17:09.480
So I'm calling it Putin's one crazed madman's unnecessary invasion of a country.

17:09.480 --> 17:14.120
And obviously, my heart goes out to, I don't know if we have listeners in Ukraine or that

17:14.120 --> 17:19.520
area, but my heart goes out to the folks there and I hope everybody is safe throughout all

17:19.520 --> 17:20.520
that.

17:20.560 --> 17:25.920
There's an artist though that I follow in Russia, who I'm on Patreon.

17:25.920 --> 17:32.040
He does NSFW stuff, but his art is beautiful, named Dima.

17:32.040 --> 17:37.780
And he sent out a letter to all his patrons talking about how he's expecting like a full

17:37.780 --> 17:39.640
internet lockdown.

17:39.640 --> 17:43.760
And I mean, this is, you know, his livelihood.

17:43.760 --> 17:47.360
And it's really, really depressing.

17:47.360 --> 17:52.800
There's a lot of people in Russia who are negatively affected by this and completely

17:52.800 --> 17:56.640
don't support the action whatsoever.

17:56.640 --> 18:01.640
They're dealing with their you-know-who, you know?

18:01.640 --> 18:02.640
Yep.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.640
Yep.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.440
And I've heard, unfortunately, some stuff on Facebook.

18:06.440 --> 18:09.840
So I always take it with a grain of salt, but that we have a very large Russian population

18:09.840 --> 18:11.320
here in the Sacramento area.

18:11.320 --> 18:15.120
And unfortunately, I'm already hearing about people are bashing local businesses and stuff

18:15.280 --> 18:20.020
when it's like, that makes no sense whatsoever because most people came over here to get

18:20.020 --> 18:21.640
away from Putin and all that.

18:21.640 --> 18:27.320
I mean, and then on top of the fact that again, not everybody in Russia is supporting what

18:27.320 --> 18:28.320
Putin's doing.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.440
So don't be stupid about it.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.440
Yeah.

18:32.440 --> 18:38.920
So let's just hope that a peaceful resolution can be found quickly.

18:38.920 --> 18:44.840
And Putin obviously needs to lose a lot of the access that he has now.

18:44.840 --> 18:49.200
I'm digressing a little bit, but this does have to do with video games, absolutely, because

18:49.200 --> 18:54.320
a lot of your video games are being developed in Ukraine and the region and of course, streamers

18:54.320 --> 18:57.400
and fans, of course, lots in Ukraine.

18:57.400 --> 19:03.060
I was going to mention there's a very well-known Final Fantasy XIV streamer that was an American,

19:03.060 --> 19:06.440
I believe, living in Ukraine, going to school or something like that.

19:06.440 --> 19:10.680
And she's been given updates and I think she's in Poland right now as a lot of people have

19:10.680 --> 19:11.940
gone over there and so forth.

19:11.940 --> 19:20.860
So there's just a whole big fucking country getting attacked.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.020
It's mind blowing when you're on the other side of the world.

19:23.020 --> 19:26.060
You can't fathom what's going on.

19:26.060 --> 19:30.580
But you're definitely hearing from people that are over there and gaming companies that

19:30.580 --> 19:34.940
are over there and how they are reacting.

19:34.940 --> 19:41.100
So we have GSE Game World, who is the studio that's behind the Stalker series or S-T-A-L-K-E-R.

19:41.100 --> 19:49.620
They wrote a tweet that is asking folks to share their post with special aid information.

19:49.620 --> 19:54.420
4A Games, who makes the Metro games, also shared a statement.

19:54.420 --> 19:58.620
Frogwares said in their Twitter, we can't just stand by.

19:58.620 --> 20:01.900
Russia attacks our homeland and denies the sovereignty of Ukraine.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.840
We are trying to stay safe, but this is war.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.140
There's no two ways about it.

20:05.140 --> 20:09.380
We call on everyone to force Putin to withdraw from our lands.

20:09.420 --> 20:15.220
Esports organizations, Navi is based out of Ukraine and shared a donation link.

20:15.220 --> 20:21.060
Publishers, Crativo, TinyBuild, trying to help their employees that are based out of Ukraine.

20:21.060 --> 20:23.340
I mean, this goes on and on and on.

20:23.340 --> 20:26.900
I'm sure you've seen an awful lot on social media about it.

20:26.900 --> 20:32.100
It definitely seems like, I don't know how y'all feel, but I definitely feel almost helpless

20:32.100 --> 20:35.500
sometimes watching this stuff unfold on TV.

20:35.500 --> 20:40.740
Obviously, there are humanitarian organizations that if you are able to, would happily be

20:40.740 --> 20:44.540
able to accept donations and money and things like that, and there's no shortage of suggestions

20:44.540 --> 20:48.180
out there online.

20:48.180 --> 20:54.720
Spreading awareness is actually very important because there's disinformation campaigns going

20:54.720 --> 20:59.380
on within Russia about what is actually happening.

20:59.380 --> 21:02.540
Where have I heard of disinformation campaigns being a thing before?

21:02.580 --> 21:06.340
Anyway, I don't want to get off the mark too much, but we know that disinformation goes

21:06.340 --> 21:10.460
on out there, so sharing information is very important as well.

21:10.460 --> 21:15.100
Mike Deaf points out, this war of mine is donating all their profits to help out Ukraine.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.100
Yes, I saw that.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.100
The devs of that game.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.860
The game is called This War of Mine.

21:18.860 --> 21:22.860
That is 11-bit studios that made that game, that is doing that as well.

21:22.860 --> 21:27.760
Obviously, the games industry is absolutely impacted by this because the entire world

21:27.760 --> 21:28.900
is impacted by this.

21:28.900 --> 21:35.500
I think this is why many of us really pray for, or whatever it is you do, for a quick

21:35.500 --> 21:38.620
resolution to this whole situation.

21:38.620 --> 21:42.660
Anything that any of my co-hosts wanted to add on that before we get to our gaming weeks?

21:42.660 --> 21:44.940
No, I didn't really have anything.

21:44.940 --> 21:45.940
He could stop.

21:45.940 --> 21:46.940
That's the thing.

21:46.940 --> 21:48.940
He could stop.

21:48.940 --> 21:49.940
Anytime.

21:49.940 --> 21:53.940
Supposedly, they are going to do some talks in Belarus.

21:53.940 --> 21:58.460
I'm trying not to get too optimistic, but what else can I do?

21:58.460 --> 22:00.620
But try to have hope.

22:00.620 --> 22:15.620
I saw that people are wondering why Ukraine isn't trying to go for other methods, reach

22:15.620 --> 22:20.260
out, but there was a sign that I saw that summed that up perfectly that Russia could

22:20.260 --> 22:22.700
stop anytime and the war would be over.

22:22.700 --> 22:26.940
If Ukraine stops, there's no more Ukraine.

22:26.940 --> 22:29.660
That's an excellent point.

22:29.660 --> 22:36.580
There's already pictures of bodies.

22:36.580 --> 22:38.020
They may be triggering for some people.

22:38.020 --> 22:41.620
I don't want to shy away from the fact.

22:41.620 --> 22:45.240
That's fine if you can't look at it, but someone does need to see it and drive home.

22:45.240 --> 22:52.500
It's one thing when you hear it on TV or see it on Twitter or something, or us talking

22:52.500 --> 22:53.620
about it.

22:53.620 --> 22:57.980
It's another thing when you let it become real for you.

22:57.980 --> 23:00.980
On that note, though, and I think this is very important because we've seen where video

23:00.980 --> 23:06.180
games again come into play here, be very careful of misinformation and trusted video sources

23:06.180 --> 23:11.340
because we've seen on Twitter where old video game footage from war-based games is being

23:11.340 --> 23:16.380
circulated and labeled actual footage from what's going on and people are really quick

23:16.380 --> 23:18.220
to retweet that shit.

23:18.220 --> 23:20.260
You've got to be very careful.

23:20.260 --> 23:26.940
I think we all have a responsibility when we click that Retreat button or just question

23:26.940 --> 23:28.020
the source.

23:28.020 --> 23:34.620
If the source is coming from a news account you've never heard of, question that.

23:34.620 --> 23:36.620
You've just got to be careful.

23:36.620 --> 23:43.860
Again, for news sources that you do recognize, check them on the bias map.

23:43.860 --> 23:47.740
You want to stay center of the road as much as possible.

23:47.740 --> 23:52.100
If you do read something that's slanted one direction, make sure you read something that

23:52.100 --> 23:54.180
is equally slanted the opposite direction.

23:54.180 --> 23:56.140
Have a well-rounded view of it.

23:56.140 --> 23:57.500
The truth will be somewhere in the middle.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.500
J.B.

23:58.500 --> 24:02.300
WOGAN There's a point that none of the fake videos use Command & Conquer Red Alert.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.820
I mean, really, that's just a missed opportunity in my opinion.

24:04.820 --> 24:05.820
A.P.

24:05.820 --> 24:06.820
Not going to go there.

24:06.820 --> 24:07.820
All right.

24:07.820 --> 24:08.820
Moving on.

24:08.820 --> 24:11.580
Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have been

24:11.580 --> 24:14.140
playing this week and how was your gaming week.

24:14.140 --> 24:15.940
How have you been taking your mind off of?

24:15.940 --> 24:21.020
I mean, you think like just when COVID, I don't want to say COVID is going away because

24:21.020 --> 24:22.900
we all know COVID is never going away.

24:22.900 --> 24:23.900
But just when it seems like-

24:23.900 --> 24:24.900
J.B.

24:24.900 --> 24:25.900
WOGAN Oh, we're going into summer.

24:25.900 --> 24:26.900
It's going to get bad.

24:26.900 --> 24:27.900
A.P.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.060
COVID is in a dip, we'll say.

24:31.060 --> 24:34.580
Just when you think like COVID is in a dip and it's safe to do certain things, now this

24:34.580 --> 24:35.580
happens.

24:35.580 --> 24:38.540
And it's just like, can't we have a normal fucking summer ever again?

24:38.540 --> 24:39.540
J.B.

24:39.540 --> 24:40.540
WOGAN We're going to need a bigger boat.

24:40.540 --> 24:41.540
A.P.

24:41.540 --> 24:42.540
At least we have video games.

24:42.540 --> 24:43.540
So how was your gaming week?

24:43.540 --> 24:44.540
Dark Soccer.

24:44.540 --> 24:45.540
I'll start with you as I always do.

24:46.140 --> 24:47.140
J.B.

24:47.140 --> 24:52.380
WOGAN Well, I pretty much my Saturday and Wednesday post work streams have been dedicated

24:52.380 --> 24:55.260
to the Legend of Zelda and Link to the Past.

24:55.260 --> 24:58.580
I am cheating because I can.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.780
I'm not playing the game for a challenge.

25:00.780 --> 25:03.340
I'm playing the game because I fucking love the game and I love playing it and I love

25:03.340 --> 25:05.220
going around and finding shit.

25:05.220 --> 25:13.740
You know, I once again, true to form, did the palaces out of order because I always

25:13.740 --> 25:19.220
do blind the thief before I do the forest palace.

25:19.220 --> 25:20.500
And I don't even know why.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.860
I've always done it that way.

25:21.860 --> 25:23.900
And I keep thinking, oh, I'll do it the right way.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.640
Well, isn't blind first?

25:25.640 --> 25:26.640
Don't I do that one first?

25:26.640 --> 25:27.640
No.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.220
So I just said, screw it.

25:29.220 --> 25:30.660
I can do them out of order if I want to.

25:30.660 --> 25:31.660
I'm an adult.

25:31.660 --> 25:35.620
So, um, but I finished, um, palace six.

25:35.620 --> 25:43.040
I now have all of the items except what I need from, uh, seven and eight, which I get

25:43.040 --> 25:51.300
the one of the staves, I think either in seven or eight and then the mirror shield.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.980
Um, and I get the red mail from somewhere as well.

25:54.980 --> 26:01.780
I got, I got the, the one stave last night, uh, staff staves, you know what I mean?

26:01.780 --> 26:05.420
Um, at any rate, um, I've really, I've really been enjoying that and I'm trying

26:05.420 --> 26:06.820
to decide what I want to do next.

26:06.820 --> 26:12.860
I might do terror enigma or I might do playing, you know, shooter of Saturn games and being

26:12.860 --> 26:14.220
bad at it.

26:14.220 --> 26:18.580
Like the original gun bird or radiant silver gun, or I might actually play grandia.

26:18.580 --> 26:24.040
I have a translated Saturn version of it and I'm actually kind of considering playing grandia.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.040
So we'll see.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.260
Maybe I'll make a poll.

26:26.260 --> 26:31.820
I definitely moving on the soul blazer trilogy with a terror enigma.

26:31.820 --> 26:35.260
I well, I played such a good underrated series.

26:35.300 --> 26:38.540
And the one I haven't really played a whole lot of is terror enigma.

26:38.540 --> 26:40.660
So that's kind of why I'm thinking about that.

26:40.660 --> 26:43.780
I'm also considering Seiken Densetsu three, so we'll see.

26:43.780 --> 26:48.100
I've got so many, you know, things up, up, you know, on my list and everything.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.380
I might even just play like bad power Rangers games.

26:50.380 --> 26:51.380
I don't know.

26:51.380 --> 26:52.380
I'll figure it out.

26:52.380 --> 26:55.020
But, um, I'm also of course playing dead by daylight.

26:55.020 --> 27:00.180
I've been hanging out with Debbie a little bit less because, uh, she's a bitch.

27:00.180 --> 27:05.820
Um, I have accidentally adopted nemesis.

27:05.820 --> 27:11.540
Like oops, I, I adopted, um, so that's another one off of my list cause I hate playing nemesis.

27:11.540 --> 27:12.540
I did a chat.

27:12.540 --> 27:17.100
It's like the challenge that they give you like right when you start off the game.

27:17.100 --> 27:20.800
I forgot what they call those challenges, like the dailies.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.460
And it was to sacrifice two people.

27:23.460 --> 27:29.500
I didn't remember that I still had my adapt build on so, and I expected to totally like

27:29.500 --> 27:36.020
kill nobody because I suck at nemesis, but I got a four K and I thanked the people I

27:36.020 --> 27:37.020
played against.

27:37.020 --> 27:43.300
Uh, you know, I, I, okay, so I have to take a little tangent, little tangent.

27:43.300 --> 27:50.820
I have been doing this thing now where instead of being bitchy or trolly in postgame chat,

27:50.820 --> 27:57.500
I'm actually being really nice, really nice, like, Hey, I'm a little bit off my game.

27:57.500 --> 27:58.500
Congrats.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.300
Hope you have a great night.

28:00.300 --> 28:03.300
And if people are really cool, then I will give them my favorite blessing.

28:03.300 --> 28:08.380
May you jump in the hatch in front of a camping basement, Bubba.

28:08.380 --> 28:15.100
Um, and for the most part, people who have started off being like really rude and trolly

28:15.100 --> 28:20.220
actually apologize and turn around because I have made them feel like shit because that's,

28:20.220 --> 28:22.660
that's what's reverse trolling, reverse trolling.

28:22.660 --> 28:26.420
Or there's people who are genuinely nice and you know, and I typically mean it when I say

28:26.420 --> 28:29.220
have a good evening and are like, Oh, well you too.

28:29.220 --> 28:34.620
And that's my little piece to combat toxicity in the game.

28:34.620 --> 28:38.440
And so far it actually makes my games feel like they're more fun when I'm done.

28:38.440 --> 28:43.540
If I put a little positive spin at the end, I mean, the one thing I'll do is like, Oh,

28:43.540 --> 28:47.180
all of you are great except for the loser that disconnected.

28:47.180 --> 28:48.260
And then I report them.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.380
So that's the one thing I'm trying to do.

28:50.380 --> 28:57.740
I'm trying to make my little corner of gaming slightly more delightful instead of toxic

28:57.740 --> 28:58.740
sludge.

28:58.740 --> 28:59.740
I like that.

28:59.740 --> 29:00.740
Yeah.

29:00.740 --> 29:06.460
Um, I am also of course still playing Fantasian, but now I am like way too low level to do

29:06.460 --> 29:08.740
damn near anything.

29:08.740 --> 29:14.140
Like I got my ass handed to me on a battle that it said I was at the right level for.

29:14.140 --> 29:23.220
So I might actually do more of Fantasian offline just to, uh, just to grind a little bit and

29:23.220 --> 29:30.260
uh, go back to, go back to it when I'm not feeling as, uh, pained by it.

29:30.260 --> 29:37.380
So, um, and you know, other than that, it's just been, you know, we had some pinball stuff

29:37.380 --> 29:38.380
going on.

29:38.380 --> 29:43.180
We're making some hard decisions about which ones we're going to sell to afford the big

29:43.180 --> 29:44.180
one.

29:44.180 --> 29:50.220
Um, they disassembled creature from the black lagoon in the living room yesterday while

29:50.220 --> 29:51.220
I was working.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.260
And that was really intensely annoying.

29:53.260 --> 29:54.260
Oh, wow.

29:54.260 --> 29:59.020
But other than that, been, been pretty, been pretty okay.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.020
Been pretty okay.

30:00.020 --> 30:06.180
So yeah, just those are, those are my, oh, and wordscapes, but it doesn't count.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.180
All right, Loki, we'll go to you.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.560
How was your gaming week?

30:09.560 --> 30:18.240
It was Minecraft, surprise, um, no, so I actually did play a bit of, um, nerdcraft is mostly

30:18.240 --> 30:22.880
like kind of editing stuff, but I did a little bit of, uh, nerdcraft stuff.

30:22.880 --> 30:28.680
I posted a video as a second part of a video I posted, uh, the previous to that, uh, cause

30:28.680 --> 30:29.680
I had a lot of footage.

30:29.680 --> 30:32.960
I had to split it up in two because it had been way too long otherwise.

30:32.960 --> 30:38.360
And then I've been working on a mod pack for, uh, the one 19 snapshot that just came out.

30:38.360 --> 30:45.320
So they have a brand new kind of, uh, experimental snapshot featuring the warden, which is kind

30:45.320 --> 30:51.860
of the new like boss creature that's in the, will be in the upcoming Minecraft version.

30:51.860 --> 31:00.000
And so I created a mod pack with, um, the data packs and stuff in there to spread this

31:00.000 --> 31:05.320
block called skulk around the entire world, basically.

31:05.320 --> 31:10.680
Um, with that skulk has this thing called a skulk sensor that detects vibrations.

31:10.680 --> 31:17.840
And if you, um, do enough movement or hit things or whatever, it'll send off, it can

31:17.840 --> 31:22.280
possibly send off this other block, which is called a skulk shrieker.

31:22.280 --> 31:28.080
And if that goes off in the right scenario, then the warden spawns and it's basically

31:28.080 --> 31:29.080
not easily killed.

31:29.080 --> 31:33.480
I mean, you can kind of cheese it right now cause it's still work in progress, but it's,

31:33.480 --> 31:35.120
you know, basically a tank.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.200
You can't just like fight it hand to hand.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.840
You have to kind of cheese it if you want to win.

31:39.840 --> 31:43.960
So I'm building a whole Minecraft hardcore series around that where it's just spawning

31:43.960 --> 31:44.960
everywhere.

31:44.960 --> 31:49.160
Cause I see all these videos of people like going into the new biome in the game called

31:49.160 --> 31:52.960
the deep dark and they're like, Oh my God, once, you know, warden, this is so intense

31:52.960 --> 31:53.960
and stuff.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.960
I'm like, you haven't seen anything yet.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.880
So, um, that's what I'm working on.

31:58.880 --> 31:59.880
So I have a new series.

31:59.880 --> 32:05.040
I put out a little teaser trailer for it called the deep dark world, and then I just

32:05.040 --> 32:06.760
needed to start filming it.

32:06.760 --> 32:11.080
I did kind of a live stream last Sunday, a similar concept I added.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.640
I finally got shares working.

32:12.640 --> 32:18.120
So that's why I'm also restarting the series and the seed was on before was kind of boring.

32:18.120 --> 32:23.760
So I'm going to try to get a better seed to play in and then, um, yeah.

32:23.760 --> 32:29.860
And so we'll film that and then kind of want to edit, you know, uh, very, uh, cinematically.

32:29.860 --> 32:34.660
So I'll do that the side from all that, uh, gaming wise, I got a new computer.

32:34.660 --> 32:39.600
Um, it's not hooked up yet because it's slightly broken at the moment.

32:39.600 --> 32:44.760
So it, it's, it's no fault of the person that sent it to me.

32:44.760 --> 32:48.760
It's something came loose or something happened in shipping.

32:48.760 --> 32:56.180
And so my radiator on it, the fans don't spin, they, they light up, but they don't spin,

32:56.180 --> 33:03.220
which tells me that the, uh, PC fan, uh, cable or whatever, whatever's controlling

33:03.220 --> 33:06.460
the speed of the fans is not hooked up or something.

33:06.460 --> 33:08.860
Although I can't see anything that's disconnected.

33:08.860 --> 33:13.340
So, um, I don't know, I'm going to probably have to take it to a shop to have them look

33:13.340 --> 33:14.340
at it.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.500
Cause I just, I just don't want to mess with it.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.420
Um, but it's very nice.

33:18.420 --> 33:24.900
It's um, it's an I nine, I think 10, 900, uh, KF or something like that.

33:24.940 --> 33:26.940
Um, I think that's what it was maybe 10, 700.

33:26.940 --> 33:32.380
I don't remember, but it's, you know, 10 cores, 20 threads, uh, fast three, seven up to I

33:32.380 --> 33:39.660
think five, four, um, gigahertz as 32 gigs of Ram, six terabyte hard drives.

33:39.660 --> 33:45.960
Um, it's a got a 30, 80 TI in it and a dedicated capture card.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.100
So it's like perfect for streaming.

33:48.100 --> 33:51.140
Um, so that's kind of what I wanted it for.

33:51.140 --> 33:56.740
Um, also cause my stupid laptop is so loud that I have to literally edit my voice.

33:56.740 --> 34:02.300
I have to record my voice separate and then I have to edit out these loud fan from it.

34:02.300 --> 34:05.580
Although now that I look at it, you know, I've, this thing has like so many fans on

34:05.580 --> 34:06.580
it.

34:06.580 --> 34:13.160
It may be louder, but, and I had to have it on my desk cause, uh, you know, the cables

34:13.160 --> 34:14.160
won't reach otherwise.

34:14.160 --> 34:17.460
Um, it will be a mess.

34:17.460 --> 34:25.260
So hopefully it's not louder, but I'm looking forward to playing around the 30, 80 TI cause

34:25.260 --> 34:26.260
it's going to be pretty good.

34:26.260 --> 34:28.160
I mean, this is not bad right now.

34:28.160 --> 34:32.500
It's got a 20, 70 in it, but you know, it'd be nice not to have a laptop anymore.

34:32.500 --> 34:37.340
Um, cause I've been playing on like gaming laptops for a while and um, it's just nice

34:37.340 --> 34:38.940
to have like a dedicated desktops.

34:38.940 --> 34:40.980
I don't really take my computer anywhere anymore.

34:40.980 --> 34:45.580
I used to like take it all over the place and it liked to the show and stuff, but, um,

34:45.580 --> 34:47.420
you know, it'll be nice to kind of have that.

34:47.420 --> 34:50.900
Plus we'll still have my laptop if I need to, you know, do stuff with it.

34:50.900 --> 34:51.900
All right.

34:51.900 --> 34:56.540
Um, let's see, my gaming week, uh, my gaming week was pretty unexciting because of the

34:56.540 --> 34:57.660
move and everything.

34:57.660 --> 35:01.380
So there's very little I've been playing, uh, like, like dark Sakura has her word scapes.

35:01.380 --> 35:02.660
I've been playing word hole.

35:02.660 --> 35:05.140
Uh, but now, now it's not just wordle.

35:05.140 --> 35:08.980
I really enjoy cordle, the one that's four of them at once.

35:08.980 --> 35:15.540
And then the one that's really awesome as is seto wordle or it's 16, 16 wordles, all

35:15.540 --> 35:19.300
at once in 21 guesses, uh, that one is a lot of fun.

35:19.300 --> 35:22.180
So I've, I've still found, found time for things like that.

35:22.180 --> 35:25.740
Uh, but otherwise, as far as like playing like actual games, like my consoles aren't

35:25.740 --> 35:26.740
even hooked up right now.

35:26.740 --> 35:28.940
Um, that's something I've got to take care of in the coming days.

35:28.940 --> 35:31.220
I had to get some new HDMI cables.

35:31.220 --> 35:35.100
I really want to get on the new expedition for no man's sky.

35:35.100 --> 35:38.020
So when I do get set up, I'm hoping I can do some streaming.

35:38.020 --> 35:42.300
The nice thing about this new space, Alan and I have separate spaces.

35:42.300 --> 35:45.900
We can stream together and our internet, now that we have fiber internet, we don't

35:45.900 --> 35:46.900
have cable.

35:46.900 --> 35:47.900
We have fiber now.

35:47.900 --> 35:51.220
So our, our upload is as fast as our downloads.

35:51.220 --> 35:55.460
So that is, that is why also dark soccer and Loki can actually see the show.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.980
I don't know if you guys know for the past, you know, however long we've been doing the

35:57.980 --> 36:01.160
show virtually, they could never see me during the show.

36:01.160 --> 36:05.620
You guys could be, but they couldn't, but now I'm uploading so much.

36:05.620 --> 36:10.100
Uh, they can see me, you can see me and, uh, Alan could probably be streaming right now

36:10.100 --> 36:12.020
as well and it wouldn't affect anything.

36:12.060 --> 36:13.460
So that'll be really fun.

36:13.460 --> 36:16.660
So I'm hoping we can get into that and maybe some, uh, dead by daylight and who knows what,

36:16.660 --> 36:21.500
but honestly, I've been playing a little dead by daylight, uh, and Final Fantasy 14, just

36:21.500 --> 36:24.380
because they're on my PC, easy decompression games.

36:24.380 --> 36:26.180
Um, but I haven't been playing a lot.

36:26.180 --> 36:31.400
I would say my big dead by daylight achievement, I got Felix to level 50 and I'm probably going

36:31.400 --> 36:32.660
to prestige him.

36:32.660 --> 36:35.860
Um, and that's because he still doesn't have borrowed time.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.900
So I'll probably just prestige him.

36:37.900 --> 36:40.780
Um, and that does remind me.

36:40.780 --> 36:44.140
Yeah, I should have pig P three 50 this week.

36:44.220 --> 36:44.620
Oh, nice.

36:44.620 --> 36:45.060
Congrats.

36:45.580 --> 36:47.660
Um, I, there is one game.

36:47.700 --> 36:47.940
Okay.

36:47.940 --> 36:48.820
So here's the nice thing.

36:48.820 --> 36:51.500
Now that I have the fiber internet, that's unlimited.

36:52.140 --> 36:56.540
I went through and patched all these fucking games that I've been waiting on for so long.

36:56.540 --> 37:00.540
And even Alan reminded me last night, you could download flight simulator again.

37:00.540 --> 37:02.900
And I was like, I could, you're right.

37:02.900 --> 37:07.380
I haven't done that yet, but one of the games that I patched, I've been waiting on for forever

37:07.380 --> 37:11.180
is DJ max technica on a PC, the steam version.

37:11.340 --> 37:13.500
And I actually played a little bit of that.

37:13.500 --> 37:17.300
I don't, when did they start doing season content and that game?

37:17.300 --> 37:20.420
Cause I've missed that and they're up to like season four.

37:20.420 --> 37:20.940
Whoops.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.660
Uh, so I was playing a little bit of that.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.700
I had to play flea.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.620
It's my favorite song.

37:24.700 --> 37:27.300
And then I was checking out some other songs that they've added in that as well.

37:27.300 --> 37:32.020
So I guess there was a little bit of that, that might add a surprise in a good way.

37:32.020 --> 37:36.100
Some of our music game fans is that I was getting back into DJ max technica this week.

37:36.140 --> 37:38.340
Thanks to, uh, getting everything patched.

37:38.820 --> 37:39.220
All right.

37:39.540 --> 37:41.180
Um, that's it for our gaming week.

37:41.220 --> 37:45.220
Let's get into some more news again, if you're just joining us tonight.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.860
Uh, this is the first show in a new space.

37:48.060 --> 37:51.940
Some things may be a little bit off and echoey while we try to get things worked out.

37:51.940 --> 37:56.380
So sorry about that, but we wanted to do a show, which is better than no show.

37:56.700 --> 37:59.540
Uh, let's get to some big headlines this week.

37:59.540 --> 37:59.940
Loki.

38:00.780 --> 38:01.220
Yes.

38:01.220 --> 38:05.220
Capcom had teased with a countdown and then an announcement.

38:05.220 --> 38:11.700
Um, street fighter six is coming out with ultra wide, uh, Ryu.

38:13.140 --> 38:19.940
He is like super ultra wide and his very defined Dick in the trailer.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.940
Or at least that's what some people are seeing in that trailer.

38:24.740 --> 38:28.220
I'm just saying, you know, he was my first video game crush.

38:28.460 --> 38:28.780
Oh yeah.

38:28.780 --> 38:30.220
He's still my video game crush.

38:30.220 --> 38:30.740
Come on.

38:32.780 --> 38:35.020
No, I, I think, I think it's just a fold.

38:35.020 --> 38:39.300
And the clothes, but you know how some people will, it's what do they call it?

38:39.300 --> 38:41.180
The Roshashark test, the ink blots.

38:41.260 --> 38:45.740
Some people will see different things and some people are seeing some things in Ryu's

38:45.740 --> 38:46.260
pants.

38:46.300 --> 38:47.340
So there is that.

38:47.860 --> 38:51.060
Um, but yeah, the, the trailer was, it's short.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.420
It didn't show any gameplay whatsoever.

38:53.420 --> 38:53.780
So it wasn't,

38:53.780 --> 38:55.060
I don't know who the other character is.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.460
I don't know if it's a new character or some other character, but

38:57.500 --> 38:58.820
I think his name is Lucas.

38:58.820 --> 39:02.220
He was the last street fighter five DLC character.

39:02.220 --> 39:07.540
And I'm assuming it is what was all intended to be a tie into six all along.

39:08.020 --> 39:09.820
So, um, I think that's what that is.

39:10.140 --> 39:10.740
Yeah.

39:11.020 --> 39:11.300
Okay.

39:11.620 --> 39:15.580
Um, the more exciting thing I think is actually the Capcom fighting collection,

39:15.700 --> 39:18.740
which has a bunch of different games in there, uh, including dark

39:18.740 --> 39:22.180
stockers, the night warriors, night warriors, dark stockers, revenge, vampire

39:22.180 --> 39:28.180
hunter to dark stockers, revenge, vampire savior, vampire savior to red earth, super

39:28.220 --> 39:33.100
gem fighter, mini mix cyber bots, full metal madness, super puzzle fighter to

39:33.100 --> 39:36.780
turbo and hyper street fighter to the anniversary edition.

39:36.980 --> 39:38.220
There's not as many red earth.

39:38.300 --> 39:38.580
I know.

39:38.580 --> 39:42.420
I was going to say, you said a bunch of games and red earth, red earth.

39:43.500 --> 39:43.740
Yeah.

39:43.740 --> 39:46.340
There's not a lot of street fighter in there because they just did a street

39:46.340 --> 39:47.100
fighter collection.

39:47.100 --> 39:48.180
So it makes sense.

39:48.220 --> 39:51.700
Um, but yeah, dark Sakura.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.940
Uh, I don't know if you've done red earth as a classic game of the week, but let's,

39:54.940 --> 39:55.820
let's talk about that.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.540
Why are you so excited about this?

39:59.100 --> 40:00.700
It never got any sort of home port.

40:02.580 --> 40:04.260
Here anyway, did it, did it?

40:04.540 --> 40:06.500
No, I guess it never came out in Japan either.

40:06.500 --> 40:06.940
Wow.

40:07.460 --> 40:12.180
No, it's they, you, I mean, the, the two times I've played, it was once in an

40:12.180 --> 40:15.580
arcade game and another one on somebody's a CPS converter.

40:16.100 --> 40:16.540
Wow.

40:16.860 --> 40:18.980
And it had, it had another name in Japan, right?

40:19.380 --> 40:22.780
It was, uh, I can't remember the name of it.

40:22.860 --> 40:23.900
They call it somebody in chat.

40:23.900 --> 40:25.460
No, I know what it was called.

40:25.460 --> 40:29.180
It was, um, called, uh, uh, Warzard.

40:29.540 --> 40:30.140
That's it.

40:30.140 --> 40:30.660
Warzard.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.100
Yeah.

40:31.460 --> 40:31.860
Yeah.

40:33.060 --> 40:33.420
Nice.

40:33.460 --> 40:40.140
And on top of that, the red earth wasn't really that widespread here in the U S

40:40.180 --> 40:44.940
and the only character that a lot of people knew from that game was, uh, um,

40:45.380 --> 40:47.900
Tessa or Tabasa.

40:49.460 --> 40:53.860
Uh, dark Tetsuya, uh, a well, our historian in the house saying red earth was the

40:53.860 --> 40:56.340
classic game of the week, episode 829.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.900
That's a little more recently than I would have thought that

40:58.900 --> 41:00.380
was three years ago.

41:01.620 --> 41:02.100
Nice.

41:02.580 --> 41:04.340
But it's, it's a beautiful game.

41:04.340 --> 41:12.020
I mean, of course it's got that sort of alpha, um, era artwork, but I mean, the

41:12.020 --> 41:18.100
game came out in, in 96 and it's, it's still just as beautiful, but you know,

41:18.100 --> 41:21.500
what's not as beautiful the new street fighter six logo.

41:24.060 --> 41:24.620
It's beautiful.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.020
I don't hate it.

41:26.220 --> 41:28.260
I don't, I heard the clip art thing.

41:28.740 --> 41:32.660
I think that's just a weird coincidence because it is a minimalist style.

41:33.220 --> 41:39.060
I don't hate it, but it's like when you don't show a single frame of the game,

41:39.420 --> 41:41.180
which is what Capcom chose to do.

41:41.180 --> 41:43.340
And I understand a teaser is a teaser fine.

41:44.180 --> 41:47.820
And all you give is the logo for people to dissect and make their

41:47.820 --> 41:51.220
three hour YouTube's about, then this is exactly what you're going to get.

41:51.300 --> 41:51.700
Right.

41:51.740 --> 41:53.620
Is what's happening in this particular case.

41:53.620 --> 41:57.860
So, you know, I don't hate the logo, but I want to see it emotion.

41:57.900 --> 42:01.180
I want to see like, what is the, what does the UI look like?

42:01.220 --> 42:02.940
You know, does it justify the logo?

42:03.620 --> 42:09.740
So, um, going back to the Capcom fighting collection, we have a lot of people in

42:09.740 --> 42:14.540
chat that of course are bringing up, uh, rival schools, uh, and the, or the

42:14.540 --> 42:19.700
lack thereof in this collection, SSJ owner Matt says project justice or rival

42:19.700 --> 42:22.460
school just can't get on these Capcom collections.

42:22.500 --> 42:22.700
Yeah.

42:22.700 --> 42:23.580
What's up with that?

42:23.580 --> 42:28.620
Is it just one of those Capcom is saving it for a different collection or I mean,

42:28.660 --> 42:34.140
I usually like to think they're just being assholes is not like really like an

42:34.140 --> 42:38.660
explanation, although God damn when Nintendo's back catalog, it sure sometimes

42:38.660 --> 42:42.900
feels like it, but I feel like there's gotta be a bit like, is there a rights

42:42.900 --> 42:43.340
issue?

42:43.340 --> 42:45.420
I don't know about like maybe the music.

42:45.460 --> 42:46.540
I have no idea.

42:46.540 --> 42:47.540
It's wild.

42:48.340 --> 42:51.900
Isn't it like, because that's the 3d engine, whereas these are all 2d.

42:51.900 --> 42:54.180
I mean, it's that have anything to do with it?

42:54.180 --> 42:54.580
You think?

42:55.380 --> 42:58.220
Possibly, but I feel like that hasn't stopped other games.

42:58.260 --> 43:01.540
Don't they have like, I'm sure that they've got emulators at this point that

43:01.540 --> 43:03.260
can handle rival schools.

43:03.260 --> 43:05.180
They're like, I wouldn't be that hard.

43:05.340 --> 43:10.140
Now DJRMS again, this is all just rumors and, you know, conclusion jumping.

43:10.140 --> 43:12.540
I think it's a good way to put it, but it's a, it's a logical one.

43:12.940 --> 43:13.980
It's plausible.

43:13.980 --> 43:19.540
We'll say, uh, DJRMS says supposedly Capcom lost the license to rival schools.

43:19.860 --> 43:23.140
I assume because the rival schools was done on the EX engine, which is

43:23.140 --> 43:28.580
connected to Arika, I think so that could be in the characters.

43:29.220 --> 43:33.180
Yeah, I guess so, but that could explain why the other game has never been just

43:33.180 --> 43:35.100
like re-released to one of these collections.

43:35.580 --> 43:37.980
So, uh, Zen Monkey 11 says, you know what?

43:38.020 --> 43:39.540
They just ruined rival schools.

43:39.540 --> 43:41.140
Let it stay the gem that it is.

43:41.540 --> 43:43.020
I can see that perspective as well.

43:43.260 --> 43:45.220
You'll never, you'll never top the original.

43:45.420 --> 43:45.860
Who knows?

43:46.460 --> 43:49.460
No, I, I, how did they, how did they ruin it?

43:49.460 --> 43:50.660
Project Justice was great.

43:52.060 --> 43:57.460
Well, but, but it's many, many years later now than the distance between those two.

43:57.500 --> 43:58.420
So maybe, I don't know.

43:58.700 --> 43:58.940
I don't know.

43:59.500 --> 44:02.820
Uh, Mike Deff does say they didn't lose it because there's literally a rival

44:02.820 --> 44:05.300
school's character in the last season past the Street Fighter 5.

44:05.500 --> 44:10.060
So the characters, I think, yeah, the IP and all that, uh, is probably still good,

44:10.060 --> 44:13.340
but we don't know so much about the actual game game.

44:13.660 --> 44:16.660
Uh, as Joe and Hermat does point out, maybe it's connected to why we don't see

44:16.700 --> 44:19.660
Street Fighter EX in any of these collections as well.

44:20.820 --> 44:21.340
Who knows?

44:21.780 --> 44:25.140
Uh, but more to come on Street Fighter 6 in the future, I'm sure.

44:25.140 --> 44:30.580
Speaking of big games with a 6 in them, uh, many, many people happy about the

44:30.580 --> 44:34.980
release of the Final Fantasy 6 pixel remaster this week, uh, and this is a

44:34.980 --> 44:38.740
little bit different than the other five pixel remasters that they did because

44:38.980 --> 44:43.340
they've actually put some of that, like two and a half D stuff in this game,

44:43.700 --> 44:45.420
namely the opera scene.

44:45.660 --> 44:49.860
So whereas Final Fantasy 6 pretty much looks like all the other pixel remasters

44:49.860 --> 44:54.740
throughout the entire game, the opera scene they decided to make look a little,

44:54.780 --> 44:58.740
they kicked it up a notch and that doesn't just include this new graphics,

44:58.980 --> 45:00.980
but there's actual singing.

45:01.180 --> 45:06.140
So they actually gave Celeste voice lines and they have an actress singing it.

45:06.580 --> 45:09.820
Now, some people are critical that the voice actress doesn't really

45:09.820 --> 45:14.780
sound like an opera singer, but a lot of people pointing out that would

45:14.780 --> 45:15.820
actually be canon.

45:16.260 --> 45:18.940
If you think about the story and the way that Celeste ends up in the

45:18.940 --> 45:21.980
opera scene anyway, she's not supposed to be a professional opera singer.

45:22.380 --> 45:26.580
Funny enough, in an interview with Nobuo Uematsu talking about all this,

45:26.780 --> 45:31.700
Uematsu kind of confirms this, saying in a quote, the Draco opera song was

45:31.700 --> 45:35.460
supposed to be sung by an opera singer, but Celeste would suddenly appear on

45:35.460 --> 45:36.180
the stage.

45:36.500 --> 45:39.660
If Celeste could actually sing real opera, that would be a lie.

45:39.860 --> 45:44.380
So we had the fixation to intentionally choose someone whose vocals didn't seem

45:44.380 --> 45:47.300
like an opera singer, but more like a musical singer.

45:47.300 --> 45:48.580
So that is kind of interesting.

45:48.900 --> 45:51.620
By the way, if you want, you can hear this now.

45:51.620 --> 45:55.740
It's actually been dubbed or whatever in many different languages.

45:56.060 --> 46:01.100
American English is one of them, but it also exists in Italian, German,

46:01.180 --> 46:06.700
Spanish, Korean, I believe Japanese as well for sure would make sense.

46:06.740 --> 46:09.660
And I think there was one other that's not in this list for some reason, but

46:09.660 --> 46:13.900
still very cool that that all time classic scene exists in all those

46:13.900 --> 46:14.780
different languages.

46:14.780 --> 46:18.740
If you want something more authentic to opera, maybe watch it in Italian and

46:18.740 --> 46:19.380
see what you think.

46:19.380 --> 46:20.860
I'm sure it's all on YouTube by now.

46:20.860 --> 46:21.540
That's for sure.

46:21.860 --> 46:25.300
So a dark to see in chat says, yeah, the opera thing makes sense.

46:25.340 --> 46:29.460
She's a general for the empire and the opera singer thing fell into her lap.

46:29.500 --> 46:29.820
Yeah.

46:29.820 --> 46:35.140
So, um, I'm very, I really, really want to play the six remaster.

46:35.300 --> 46:38.340
The music, the soundtrack is fire.

46:38.380 --> 46:39.860
Like it's really good.

46:40.180 --> 46:45.220
Um, I'm also kind of being a stick in the mud because I want them to fucking

46:45.220 --> 46:46.380
release this on console.

46:46.420 --> 46:49.460
Like how hard is that to do to release this game on console?

46:49.900 --> 46:52.780
Um, and I'm, I'm hoping they, I'm hoping they do.

46:52.860 --> 46:53.540
That's for sure.

46:54.060 --> 46:55.860
So we'll see what happens with that.

46:56.540 --> 47:02.620
Um, on a related note, and I talked about this two weeks ago, cause you

47:02.620 --> 47:05.620
might remember two weeks ago, we were talking about that Nintendo direct and

47:05.660 --> 47:07.540
the surprise announcement of live alive.

47:07.980 --> 47:13.980
And I said, you know, baby, baby, this is a test to see if chrono trigger

47:13.980 --> 47:15.340
is going to happen in this engine.

47:15.780 --> 47:20.500
We'll get this, a report from Fumitsu talking to the developers of triangle

47:20.500 --> 47:21.300
strategy.

47:21.780 --> 47:27.220
They confirmed on a square Enix radio show that president Yotsuka Matsuda once

47:27.220 --> 47:30.220
super Nintendo games remade in that art style.

47:32.060 --> 47:35.380
Well, well, what other super Nintendo games are left?

47:35.380 --> 47:38.460
I suppose there's others, but I'm just, I like to be very tunnel visioned on

47:38.460 --> 47:43.980
this in a quote, producer Tomoya Asano said, the president ordered us to make

47:43.980 --> 47:45.820
more use of HD 2d.

47:46.060 --> 47:48.980
So we decided to think about remakes of past titles.

47:49.340 --> 47:52.860
So we lined up possible titles and thought about which could be done in HD

47:52.860 --> 47:54.980
2d and brought them to the president.

47:55.620 --> 47:57.580
The list in here's here.

47:58.540 --> 48:00.060
Now wait for this.

48:00.300 --> 48:01.780
This is the real exciting part.

48:01.780 --> 48:04.620
So dark Sakura, you were just talking about Terra enigma, right?

48:04.660 --> 48:05.460
Keep that in mind.

48:06.420 --> 48:14.660
The list included titles released by square and Enix for the super Famicom

48:15.100 --> 48:19.660
ones, which were suitable for HD 2d ones, which were unsuitable for it.

48:19.940 --> 48:22.860
And ones which were a possible to play like mahjong games.

48:22.860 --> 48:23.860
Fuck the mahjong games.

48:24.620 --> 48:25.980
We know I want my shop.

48:26.580 --> 48:27.940
Some people are into those.

48:27.980 --> 48:32.700
They, they can have, they can go sit in a corner with the 5,000 other mahjong

48:32.700 --> 48:34.020
titles that exist.

48:34.340 --> 48:39.700
Give me fucking, how many of those mahjong titles are in HD 2d, not very

48:39.700 --> 48:40.220
many.

48:41.460 --> 48:45.780
We lined them all up and made a presentation that live alive was the most

48:45.780 --> 48:46.340
suitable.

48:46.660 --> 48:52.300
The second place was Actraiser and Actraiser has already been released on the

48:52.300 --> 48:57.140
switch as Actraiser Renaissance, even if it didn't end up using the same style.

48:58.740 --> 49:00.220
That is very interesting.

49:00.220 --> 49:06.020
The fact, I, I, I didn't even consider two weeks ago, Enix titles could be in play

49:06.020 --> 49:06.700
as well.

49:06.780 --> 49:09.340
That is, that's exciting.

49:09.780 --> 49:10.740
That's very exciting.

49:12.620 --> 49:15.060
Some comments about the Fanta SE 6 remaster in chat.

49:15.060 --> 49:18.980
5th Dream says the new veld theme, Wild West is so good.

49:18.980 --> 49:19.620
Yes, it is.

49:19.620 --> 49:20.060
I heard it.

49:20.060 --> 49:21.020
It's very, very good.

49:21.460 --> 49:23.220
Mike Deff says about the opera scene.

49:23.220 --> 49:25.660
It's awesome that it translated for many languages.

49:26.100 --> 49:27.540
Interested to check that out.

49:27.860 --> 49:30.820
Dartitsuya in chat says Rob hates mahjong confirmed.

49:31.260 --> 49:37.100
I spent hours and hours playing mahjong solitaire, which was released here as

49:37.100 --> 49:37.900
Shanghai.

49:38.060 --> 49:40.420
You might remember that from like the late 80s.

49:40.420 --> 49:42.540
It was like a quintessential Mac game.

49:42.900 --> 49:48.300
And I remember my uncle had a Mac for his business and he had Shanghai installed on

49:48.300 --> 49:50.180
it, which is, it's just mahjong solitaire.

49:50.620 --> 49:52.260
And I played the shit out of that game.

49:52.260 --> 49:56.060
That's the one where you have the titles and you can only move them out to the side.

49:56.060 --> 49:57.300
You can't move them up and down.

49:57.580 --> 49:58.140
That's how it works.

49:58.140 --> 50:02.460
So that's, yeah, that's, that should be a classic game sometime, sometime if it hasn't

50:02.460 --> 50:02.860
already.

50:02.860 --> 50:03.420
I don't know, maybe.

50:03.740 --> 50:07.060
So yeah, Dartitsuya says, Oh yeah, I think I remember those tile matching games.

50:07.060 --> 50:08.980
So I don't hate mahjong.

50:09.300 --> 50:11.900
I just, we've, we've had that.

50:11.940 --> 50:13.180
We don't need more.

50:14.540 --> 50:16.020
And that's, that's my opinion.

50:16.060 --> 50:16.980
I'm entitled to it.

50:17.700 --> 50:20.140
All right, let's move on to our Sakura.

50:22.300 --> 50:26.220
So I hope I'm not muted because I would be sad.

50:26.860 --> 50:27.260
Okay.

50:27.900 --> 50:33.780
So Nintendo actually did buy somebody as we teased before the show.

50:34.700 --> 50:44.620
So Nintendo has actually acquired one of their partner companies, which is SRD company

50:44.620 --> 50:45.100
limited.

50:45.540 --> 50:53.420
They were a developer of about 140 employees that has worked exclusively on first party

50:53.420 --> 50:56.220
Nintendo software for about 40 years.

50:56.700 --> 51:03.940
They operate near Nintendo's Kyoto headquarters started in 1979 and worked on games as far

51:03.940 --> 51:08.980
back as Donkey Kong and have been, had a hand in just about every major Nintendo franchise,

51:08.980 --> 51:11.740
including the Mario games, Zelda games, animal crossing.

51:12.460 --> 51:16.140
The last thing that they worked on was game builder garage, ring fit adventure, and one

51:16.140 --> 51:16.820
two switch.

51:17.420 --> 51:26.180
So the acquisition is expected to close on April 1st, assuming it gets approved.

51:28.300 --> 51:33.140
Basically the switch is a level of success, allow them to invest in different business

51:33.140 --> 51:33.940
opportunities.

51:34.420 --> 51:40.700
That's including an $880 million expansion of the game development capability.

51:41.460 --> 51:48.780
And their president, Futakara Shintaro said that it would spend up to a hundred billion

51:48.780 --> 51:53.860
yen, which is about 880 million, expanding internal game development and up to 50 billion

51:53.860 --> 51:54.100
yen.

51:54.100 --> 51:58.740
That's about 440 million growing non-game entertainment software assets like movies.

51:59.260 --> 52:06.140
So they've already started office construction to expand the Kyoto office and wanting to

52:06.140 --> 52:08.500
create more games in-house than outsource.

52:09.140 --> 52:12.180
So, yeah, pretty big news.

52:12.420 --> 52:17.060
I mean, not a lot of people know of that company, but they know of what they've done.

52:17.220 --> 52:17.540
Yeah.

52:18.620 --> 52:23.060
And it's funny because, again, going back to two weeks ago when Activision was bought by

52:23.060 --> 52:29.020
Microsoft, Bungie was bought by Sony, a lot of people were like, who's Nintendo going to

52:29.020 --> 52:29.220
buy?

52:29.220 --> 52:29.820
Konami?

52:30.060 --> 52:32.460
And it was like, no, that's not how Nintendo works.

52:32.460 --> 52:38.300
Nintendo buys companies that they, and exactly what those of us that actually pay

52:38.300 --> 52:42.260
attention throughout the years have been saying is this is exactly what's happening.

52:42.580 --> 52:46.580
Nintendo is effectively buying somebody that honest to God, I thought they already owned.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.340
Especially when you talk about the games that they made.

52:49.620 --> 52:53.580
How did they not already own the developers of Ring Fit Adventure and 1-2 Switch?

52:54.220 --> 52:57.100
Honestly, I honestly thought Nintendo already owned them.

52:57.260 --> 52:59.740
And that is very much who Nintendo buys.

52:59.820 --> 53:02.700
Companies you thought were already a part of Nintendo.

53:03.500 --> 53:05.260
And as to 100, Matt says, yeah, I agree.

53:05.260 --> 53:06.580
I thought they already owned them.

53:07.420 --> 53:08.380
Yeah, exactly.

53:08.380 --> 53:08.660
Right.

53:09.300 --> 53:11.780
So, but there you go.

53:12.020 --> 53:13.220
Now you all can shut up.

53:13.220 --> 53:14.380
Nintendo bought somebody.

53:14.540 --> 53:15.940
So everybody bought somebody.

53:16.500 --> 53:18.220
It's a new round.

53:18.220 --> 53:18.900
Round two.

53:20.620 --> 53:22.580
We'll see what happens in the next round of acquisitions.

53:22.860 --> 53:23.220
Right.

53:23.420 --> 53:23.780
All right.

53:23.780 --> 53:24.660
Who's going to get EA?

53:24.660 --> 53:25.220
Stay tuned.

53:25.540 --> 53:26.020
All right.

53:27.060 --> 53:27.780
Moving on.

53:30.100 --> 53:34.860
I was going to say maybe Nintendo might have their eye on EA.

53:35.260 --> 53:35.660
I'm kidding.

53:37.260 --> 53:37.620
All right.

53:37.620 --> 53:37.900
I know.

53:38.860 --> 53:42.180
If your podcast is telling you that, I'm sorry, I shouldn't be shady.

53:42.220 --> 53:43.420
I shouldn't be shady.

53:43.420 --> 53:45.300
I think I'm just, I'm jaded having done this.

53:45.300 --> 53:46.340
Just do it, Rob.

53:46.420 --> 53:46.700
All right.

53:46.700 --> 53:49.380
If your podcast is saying that Nintendo is going to buy EA.

53:50.820 --> 53:52.820
Your podcast isn't paying attention to the gaming industry.

53:52.820 --> 53:53.580
That's all I'm going to say.

53:54.580 --> 53:59.940
Especially after EA left them at the fucking altar with the Wii U stuff.

54:00.740 --> 54:01.700
Nintendo's not buying EA.

54:02.100 --> 54:02.500
All right.

54:03.100 --> 54:03.620
Moving on.

54:04.180 --> 54:07.300
Let's get into S200, Matt says, drag them, Rob.

54:07.420 --> 54:07.900
I will.

54:07.900 --> 54:08.420
I will.

54:09.060 --> 54:11.380
Perhaps in a new video game, Dark Soccer, we'll talk about later.

54:12.540 --> 54:16.540
Meanwhile, some companies are buying, some companies are offloading, right, Loki?

54:17.460 --> 54:17.940
Yes.

54:17.940 --> 54:23.660
Well, some some companies are finally reversing course on the dumbest decisions

54:23.660 --> 54:29.660
I've seen in the industry that is self-contained launchers for different

54:29.660 --> 54:30.180
companies.

54:30.180 --> 54:35.620
So Bethesda is getting rid of its launcher and it's going back to Steam.

54:36.060 --> 54:36.820
So that's right.

54:36.820 --> 54:41.820
You'll access all your games through Steam where it should be accessed and not

54:41.820 --> 54:43.860
through Bethesda's stupid launcher.

54:45.980 --> 54:46.660
I'm down.

54:47.500 --> 54:48.220
I love that.

54:49.500 --> 54:53.700
Yeah, I actually have the Bethesda launcher because you could grab free games

54:53.700 --> 54:56.580
on there for a while, like Quake, the original Quake.

54:56.620 --> 54:58.900
Oh, actually, I think they gave away the whole trilogy at some point.

54:59.660 --> 55:01.540
So it'll be nice to just roll that into Steam.

55:01.980 --> 55:05.460
Yeah, and it will be able to migrate to Steam as well.

55:05.500 --> 55:05.860
Yeah.

55:06.700 --> 55:09.660
So that is why I installed the Bethesda launcher.

55:09.660 --> 55:11.380
You can't transfer things over yet.

55:11.500 --> 55:13.220
That doesn't happen until I think April.

55:13.420 --> 55:15.220
Yeah, April is when they're sunsetting that.

55:15.260 --> 55:18.420
Yeah, when I read the news, I was like, oh, okay, let me move things over to

55:18.420 --> 55:18.740
Steam.

55:18.740 --> 55:21.980
And it was like, hold on, bitch, you got to wait until April to do that.

55:22.180 --> 55:25.100
I think there was another big thing they gave away not that long ago.

55:25.980 --> 55:27.620
I don't think it was Skyrim or anything like that.

55:27.620 --> 55:30.180
But I think Bethesda launched, they really tried to get people on that

55:30.180 --> 55:31.300
launcher with freebies.

55:31.300 --> 55:35.620
And well, there's just too many launchers.

55:36.180 --> 55:40.860
This one had to go and there's others that have to go to Ubisoft.

55:41.620 --> 55:46.780
But yeah, Ubisoft, they don't see them doing it because they have their, don't

55:46.780 --> 55:48.780
they have a marketplace built into that as well?

55:48.780 --> 55:50.500
So them in origin.

55:52.580 --> 55:53.260
Did they?

55:53.580 --> 55:56.620
I thought, I thought you could buy the games through the Bethesda launcher.

55:56.620 --> 55:58.180
I'm almost positive that was part of it.

55:58.180 --> 55:58.740
It had to be.

55:58.780 --> 55:59.540
I don't remember.

55:59.580 --> 55:59.940
Yeah.

55:59.980 --> 56:04.980
But yeah, you play is a little bit, come on, like Ubisoft is never going to do

56:04.980 --> 56:07.820
what's right for anybody or their employees because they're still, you

56:07.820 --> 56:10.900
know, protecting harassers of women at their company.

56:10.900 --> 56:14.660
So of course, they're not going to have anybody's best interests other than

56:14.660 --> 56:15.940
themselves in mind.

56:15.940 --> 56:17.500
So they'll never get rid of that launcher.

56:18.340 --> 56:20.900
Dark to see your reminds during QuakeCon.

56:20.900 --> 56:24.700
And then at this last year's, they let people upgrade to Quake Remastered for

56:24.700 --> 56:26.100
free if you had the original.

56:26.100 --> 56:26.300
Yeah.

56:26.340 --> 56:29.300
So if you've, if you've just had that installer sitting on your computer

56:29.300 --> 56:32.460
grabbing freebies, I think about our listener in the past, who I haven't seen

56:32.460 --> 56:35.900
in a while, but he used to always call in about the game deals and stuff and

56:36.100 --> 56:36.700
freebies.

56:36.700 --> 56:39.900
And I'm thinking like that guy just got a big payoff with this.

56:39.900 --> 56:43.500
If he's been collecting the Bethesda, he's going to have a steam library.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.300
It's going to really increase in size after this.

56:46.020 --> 56:49.740
As Stu and Hanumat says, they gave away a ton of games in that game awards video.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.940
That was nothing but a long line of free game codes.

56:51.940 --> 56:53.740
Yes, that's, that's very true.

56:53.820 --> 56:54.340
Very true.

56:55.060 --> 56:55.340
All right.

56:55.340 --> 56:59.380
Well, I know we weren't here last week, but there was at least one really big

56:59.380 --> 57:01.980
headline from last week that I think we ought to touch on.

57:01.980 --> 57:05.180
There was more than one, but I think this is really the big one that a lot of people

57:05.180 --> 57:05.860
were talking about.

57:06.180 --> 57:11.820
And that is the fact that Nintendo plans to end the Wii U and 3DS eShop purchases.

57:11.820 --> 57:14.740
And that is going to end in March of 2023.

57:14.940 --> 57:20.500
So you still have some time, but not a lot because the clock actually starts ticking

57:20.500 --> 57:21.060
in May.

57:21.420 --> 57:27.140
So on May 23rd of 2022, you will no longer be able to use a credit card to add funds

57:27.140 --> 57:29.580
to your eShop account via Wii U or 3DS.

57:29.860 --> 57:34.380
On August 29th, you can't use eShop cards to add funds anymore either.

57:34.700 --> 57:38.980
You can still use download codes, but only until March when everything sunsets.

57:39.300 --> 57:45.420
So now I believe if you already have downloaded games, you will still be able

57:45.420 --> 57:48.100
to download them because that's still the case on the Wii.

57:48.300 --> 57:52.860
They closed the Wii eShop some time ago, but you can still download old titles there.

57:53.060 --> 57:54.340
For how much longer?

57:54.620 --> 57:55.220
Who knows?

57:55.700 --> 57:58.540
But Wii U and 3DS is going to be closing.

57:58.540 --> 58:03.940
And that's a pretty big deal because obviously the 3DS had a huge long life.

58:04.340 --> 58:08.300
There's a lot of titles on there you can't play anywhere else.

58:08.940 --> 58:12.740
Somebody put together a list of like 2,000 titles off the top of my head.

58:12.940 --> 58:15.340
Harmonite was one that the Pokemon Company did.

58:15.500 --> 58:19.340
There's a lot of games on the 3DS that were only ever on the 3DS.

58:19.700 --> 58:23.340
And right now you think the Switch is backwards compatible?

58:24.780 --> 58:28.500
Wouldn't that be nice if your digital library would just spill onto the Switch?

58:28.500 --> 58:30.660
You could play it in vertical and have the two screens.

58:31.940 --> 58:32.860
That's not going to happen.

58:33.940 --> 58:36.220
So does Nintendo.

58:36.420 --> 58:39.540
And again, I don't like to think it's because they're assholes, but.

58:42.020 --> 58:44.460
Then somebody's got to give me to tell me what it is.

58:44.780 --> 58:47.020
The emulation isn't working right or something.

58:47.020 --> 58:47.580
I don't know.

58:48.740 --> 58:52.340
Nintendo is also not above putting out emulators that don't work completely.

58:52.340 --> 58:55.220
And we've seen that before and we'll see that again, I'm sure.

58:56.300 --> 59:01.340
Sjoan Hunter Matt in chat says, Nintendo doesn't understand game preservation and it's really sad.

59:02.380 --> 59:06.620
Mike Deff says, Harmonite and a horse game with cards that was developed by Game Freak.

59:06.620 --> 59:06.980
Yeah.

59:07.340 --> 59:13.460
Dejirama S says, it would be nice if they put out a 3DS adapter kit to play 3DS games on docked Switch consoles.

59:13.460 --> 59:14.540
God, I wish.

59:14.580 --> 59:15.340
I wish.

59:16.660 --> 59:21.980
Especially from a company that used to do things like the Game Boy Advance player for the GameCube.

59:21.980 --> 59:23.340
How badass was that?

59:23.540 --> 59:25.900
And then when you could like hook everything together and.

59:27.780 --> 59:31.980
Or just make something like the PlayStation TV.

59:32.220 --> 59:33.220
Yeah, I know.

59:33.220 --> 59:33.620
I know.

59:33.820 --> 59:36.660
Well, of course, that didn't end up working out in the long run either, now did it?

59:37.300 --> 59:38.020
Yeah, it didn't.

59:38.020 --> 59:40.420
But that's because I don't think the Vita was like super.

59:40.420 --> 59:44.140
I mean, I guess the Vita is somewhat popular, but like, yeah, it was just.

59:45.620 --> 59:52.740
I don't know, it was kind of unfortunate that that didn't work out because that's it's a pretty awesome device for the cost.

59:52.940 --> 01:00:04.500
Now, talking about game preservation, it's been brought up that the Wii U doesn't have the Netflix style system that the Switch does.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.420
You bought games a la carte then.

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:13.140
And even though I seem to recall when the Wii U is out, many of us were saying Nintendo should switch to a Netflix system.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.380
They have.

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:24.900
But I think because unfortunately, the Netflix has not been as vast of a library as people would have thought because of licensing issues and a lot of the third party developers kind of doing their own things.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:40.460
Now people are clamoring for the releases that were on the Wii U, because let's be real, there were things that were on the Wii U, especially from companies like Konami and stuff that don't exist on the Switch Online library.

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:49.100
And Nintendo basically said, we don't have any plans to make this accessible on the Switch or anything like that.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.420
They're just kind of pushing the Switch Online library.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.540
And as far as the retro virtual console titles.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:58.980
That's it, you better grab them while you still can on the Wii U.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:16.220
I do think this news was very interestingly timed when the two biggest obvious ones, Earthbound and Earthbound Beginnings, if those hadn't made it to Switch yet, Twitter wouldn't have shut up about anything else, I guarantee it.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:25.860
But because it's interesting that those two come over and then the very next week we're shutting it down and people still have things to complain about.

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:37.180
The Internet will always have things to complain about, but those two, if they were still missing, would have been a huge, huge deal because Earthbound Beginnings, its first go was on the Wii U.

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:45.700
Some people are thinking it might be about the 10th anniversary of the system and Dark Sakura just unlocked the secret there.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:50.420
Because I don't have the audio turned off on my on my phone.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:50.980
There you go.

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.860
The audio is a mess tonight anyway.

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:53.420
Sorry, guys.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.460
We'll work on it through the next week.

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.500
Some people are texting me.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.740
I'm like, why are you texting me?

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:57.460
That's fine.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.540
I have Discord notifications from earlier.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.580
What can you do?

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:11.020
But anyway, they basically were waiting for the Wii U to turn 10 years old, which I didn't realize the Wii U turns 10 years old in November.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.420
So this all will happen.

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:16.980
The shutdown will be after the Wii U's 10 year anniversary, which is wild to me.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:25.340
An ex Nintendo employee said Nintendo knows it has to support a product for a minimum of 10 years or they risk some class action.

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:33.140
I feel like there's companies that support things a lot shorter than that, and they don't face any type of class action.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:44.060
Like a lot of the mobile phones, Apple, you know, and a lot of those companies, Samsung, they're usually applauded for how long they do last.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.500
But it's not usually more than six or seven years.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.060
So it's interesting that Nintendo puts the line at 10.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.300
So but not that I'm complaining.

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:52.620
It's just interesting.

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:57.780
That's all. The Wii U sold 13.5 million units in its lifetime.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.940
The 3DS, 75.7 million.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.660
By the way, the Video Game History Foundation put out a tweet about all this.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:13.700
While it is unfortunate that people won't be able to purchase digital 3DS or Wii U games anymore, we understand the business reality that went into this decision.

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:21.060
What we don't understand is what path Nintendo expects its fans to take should they wish to play these games in the future.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:32.700
As a paying member of the Entertainment Software Association, Nintendo actively funds lobbying that prevents even libraries from being able to provide legal access to these games.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:43.100
Not providing commercial access is understandable, but preventing institutional work to preserve these titles on top of that is actively destructive to the video game history.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:52.580
We encourage ESA members like Nintendo to rethink their position on this issue and work with existing institutions to find a solution.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:04:02.220
A very tactful message from the Video Game History Foundation, because in my mind, I'm just waving a pirate flag all around going, I know how I'm going to fix the problem.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:10.260
Hey, if Nintendo gives us something legit, I am more than happy to support it. I really am.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:23.180
But until then, Arr matey, like yo ho ho, I want to play some of those 3DS exclusive download games that, you know, I don't even know my 3DS's battery works anymore.

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:25.620
It probably does. I haven't played it in a while.

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:34.340
ZenMonkey11 says, nice way to show thanks to your Wii U day one buyers, Nintendo, shutting them down on the day they bought it.

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:40.300
Well, it's 10 and a half years after the fact, to be fair.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.140
But hey, you know what is interesting?

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:55.540
I bet the value of a Wii U is really high right now because you can also play like, my Wii is worthless because I transferred all of my Wii titles to my Wii U at some point.

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.980
So my Wii U's got everything on it.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:02.380
So anyway, we'll see.

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.180
We'll see what develops on that front.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:12.220
And if Nintendo ever decides to do something about embracing archive and emulation and all that stuff.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:13.980
Meanwhile, Dark Siren.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.060
I don't have a lot of hopes for Nintendo.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.380
I'm going to be perfectly honest.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:17.980
I don't either.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:21.580
I mean, hope is, is.

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:23.220
Yeah.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:28.900
I hope they're making considerations for their next system, if nothing else, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.180
No, I wouldn't either.

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.140
You know, you need it to breathe anyway.

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.700
So.

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:44.620
Speaking of some other bad news, Nvidia reported that they were, quote, completely compromised by a cyber attack.

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:52.740
They said that their business was taken offline for a couple of days because of a malicious network intrusion.

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:59.940
It affected everything from email to developer tools that had already been suffering outages.

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.860
They don't know if anything has been stolen or deleted.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:10.860
If anything has affected the customers either, but it's, it's pretty bad.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.660
They're doing a full investigation right now.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.380
They don't have any really anything to share.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:29.020
They're a cybersecurity, actually, there's a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey named Alan Woodward that is saying that Nvidia's likely shut down their internal systems to minimize a risk of further damage.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:35.340
That, you know, better to keep the system completely down rather than have anything keep poking at it, you know.

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:52.500
And I mean, they, they've already been attacked before there was a, a list of 100 or so, actually more than 100s of games, unannounced games that were data mined from GeForce Now, some of which that have been announced.

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:59.380
And of course, as people are want, they want to see is Russia involved and so far, they don't have any links.

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.420
I think the opposite is going on.

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:07.500
We're hearing about and I don't know how much of it but like anonymous is apparently attacking Russian stuff.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:12.340
It's very, very fascinating to watch the drama on Twitter and other social media.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:22.140
But anyway, we don't love to see game companies get attacked, but I feel like at the same time it comes with the territory, if there's an exploit, somebody's going to exploit it.

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:31.220
Questbuster in chat says, if I recall correctly, there was an update to this that suggested they did a reverse hack and encrypted the terabyte of data that was stolen.

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.220
Interesting.

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.140
I've never, I've never heard of that.

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:37.140
No take backsies.

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.140
That's interesting.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:41.140
That's a loud follow up.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.140
All right.

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:48.140
So Steam Decks are starting to go out and we're starting to see a lot of press reviews of those.

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:53.140
I have yet to hold one in my hand, but we're getting a lot of Steam news in the past few days.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:56.140
I feel like because of like a lot of Gabe interviews are showing up.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.140
Right, Loki?

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:02.140
We lose Loki.

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.140
Hi.

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.140
Hi, Loki.

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.140
Are we to you or are we back to me?

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.140
I'm sorry.

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.140
No, I think we're back to me.

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:15.140
So let's talk about games pass.

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.140
So the PC version of games pass there.

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:31.140
There was a comment from Valve basically or Gabe Newell, I think actually was talking about it, but basically that Valve would be open to having games pass, at least the PC version of it available on Steam.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:37.140
I don't think it's something we think ourselves or we need to do ourselves building a subscription service at this time.

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:43.140
But for their customers is clearly a popular option, and we'd be more than happy to work with them to get that on Steam.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.140
Perfect.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.140
Awesome.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.140
To me, I don't know.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:52.140
Like, it's it'd be nice to have everything kind of in one one spot, but it's not a deal breaker concern.

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.140
It's a PC.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.140
You know, it's just kind of like, you know, it's not a deal breaker.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:09:02.140
You know, I open another app instead to download games pass games, but it would be cool to see that integrated.

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:06.140
Maybe that is something that they can do, especially since Microsoft's pretty keen on putting their games on Steam.

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:09.140
So I'm not sure what Microsoft gets out of that.

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:12.140
But at the same time, yeah, Microsoft's been putting their games on Steam.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.140
People have been buying them.

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:19.140
We talked about the whole there's too many launchers and now the weak ones like Bethesda's launcher are starting to fall out.

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:22.140
So I guess in that regard, it does make sense.

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:26.140
But it does also still feel a little bit like I don't know if they need it.

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:29.140
But I'm also not using game pass on PC a lot.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:32.140
I use it, but I don't use it a lot.

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:36.140
So maybe just because I have the occasional onesie twosie game, it doesn't quite feel the same.

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.140
I don't know.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:44.140
Yeah, I haven't really been utilizing it too much, but it would be cool, though, like just to have everything in one place.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:54.140
It would be cool, though, like just to have everything in one, you know, library, at least try to consolidate those libraries, because it does kind of sucks like, you know, OK, I want to play this game.

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.140
Which library do I have it in, you know, type of thing.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.140
It would be kind of cool.

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.140
I mean, at least they're open to it.

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:08.140
So that's something it might push, you know, epic to be open to it as well.

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.140
That would be interesting.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.140
All right.

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:21.140
We'll see what develops with that, especially with the Steam Deck now being a player, being able to get, you know, game pass games on that would be pretty exciting.

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:24.140
SG100Matt says they don't need it yet.

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.140
I'm not sure the Epic Game Store is hurting Steam yet.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.140
If they really wanted to one up the Epic Store, then maybe.

01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:32.140
It is interesting, though.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:41.140
It is interesting, though, I feel like we're getting a flurry of Valve news over the weekend because of the Steam Deck's release and, you know, all that.

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:47.140
So I think there was, well, Gabe Newell did like an interview with PC Gamer about a different bunch of stuff, too.

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:53.140
So and I think they also have I don't know if they have like a livestream or some sort of event or something like that.

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:57.140
But like I know there is a bunch of news, yeah, from Valve as well.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:03.140
SheHulk10 in chat says Steam should come to console Xbox Series X.

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.140
That would be interesting.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:08.140
But you've got to think we've got to go in the wayback machine.

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.140
We've got to go way back.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:18.140
But you may recall on the PlayStation 3 when Portal 2 was released, Valve had Steam built into that.

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:25.140
Most people forgot it because the PlayStation hack happened like not even a month later.

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:31.140
And I think most people got through Portal 2 by the time the PlayStation Network came back online.

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:36.140
But Steam has been baked into a console that wasn't in the orange box.

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:41.140
But the orange box might have been too soon because that was the 360 in PlayStation 2 era?

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.140
Yeah.

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.140
No, was it the PlayStation 3?

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.140
No, it was PlayStation 3.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:47.140
Yeah, so okay.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.140
But Steam wasn't baked into that yet.

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:52.140
But they did bake it into Portal 2.

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.140
So we have seen Steam on a console.

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:57.140
So that would be interesting and maybe something that Steam could leverage to get out of that.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.140
But we'll see. We'll see.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.140
Digirama S says doesn't Gabe hate Microsoft?

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.140
Did you hear what we were just talking about?

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.140
Apparently not.

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.140
Maybe not.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.140
Didn't they have Microsoft games on Steam?

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:12.140
On Steam, I don't think that they hate.

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:14.140
I don't see why he would hate them.

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.140
No, I don't either.

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.140
Especially because they all run in the same town.

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:21.140
Gabe is going to see the Microsoft people at parties and industry things.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.140
I think hate is a strong word.

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.140
So, yeah.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.140
All right.

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:34.140
Let's talk about a pair of retro stories having to do with the Nintendo Switch and some retro updates.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.140
One of them is the Taito Milestones Collection.

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:40.140
That is going to be becoming a series.

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:46.140
It was announced for the Switch in Japan, and it's going to have 10 classic Taito arcade games in it.

01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:56.140
Alpine Ski, Jack and Pop, Elevator Action, The Fairyland Story, Frontline, Haley's Comet, The Ninja Warriors, Kix, Space Seeker, and Wild Western.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:59.140
Yeah, that was the only one you were listening for, right?

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:02.140
But that's just going to be the first of several.

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:06.140
There will be more Taito arcade games in the future, so that's pretty cool.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:09.140
Hamster is putting this together, and I believe they do.

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:15.140
Hamster publishes the arcade archives, I think.

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:19.140
I'm not crossing my wires there, so I'm sure there will be more.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:26.140
Yeah, Taito has done those classic collections before, so it's about time we got them on the Switch.

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:34.140
This is more, I guess, retro adjacent, but let's talk about Tempest 4000, shall we?

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:38.140
Because Tempest 4000 is coming out on the Nintendo Switch.

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:42.140
It's going to be out on the Switch starting March 22nd, available in the eShop.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:49.140
It is the, I guess, follow-up of sorts to Tempest 2000. I thought there was a 3000 at one point, though.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.140
There was. It was a Jaguar one.

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.140
That's right, okay.

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:58.140
But Tempest 4000 is coming, and that is already available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:03.140
So you may have already played this, but it will be coming out on the Switch on March 22nd as well.

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:12.140
So a retro title there, if that is your thing, which I know we are very into retro here at Orange Lounge Radio, right?

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.140
Oh, yeah.

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:17.140
In fact, we love retro so much, we have a weekly segment that we dedicate to it.

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:36.140
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:39.140
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:42.140
And Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game tonight?

01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:44.140
I picked Metroid Fusion.

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:53.140
So Metroid Fusion, first of all, came out in 2002 in North America, November 17th.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:59.140
And actually it came out here before it came out in Japan, which was February 14th, 2003.

01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:03.140
It didn't come out in China until March 2nd, 2006.

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:09.140
But this is an action-adventure game published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:12.140
It was developed by Nintendo R&D.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:16.140
It also is the same group that did Super Metroid.

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:23.140
And you are playing as Samus Aran, who is fighting against these parasites known as X.

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:27.140
So it's a lot more, you know, typical Metroid stuff.

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:35.140
You know, it's jumping and running from things and shooting things and, you know, spin dashes and all of that.

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:39.140
You can also play this...

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:42.140
It actually was released the day after Metroid Prime came out.

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:49.140
And you can link the games via the GameCube Game Boy Advance link cable for extra content for Metroid Prime.

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:51.140
It was really good.

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:59.140
It was a little bit shorter than Super Metroid, but it had all the great control, music, graphics.

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:07.140
It was very well received, and it also included a handheld game of the year at the 2002 Interactive Achievement Awards.

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:11.140
It just got many, many positives.

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:16.140
And of course, Metroid Dread, the last one that was out on Switch, is a direct sequel.

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:32.140
So the big thing with this one is that Samus has this parasite that she's going against and finds that the parasites will replicate their host's appearance.

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:49.140
And basically, eventually, she has to fight a version of herself that has been stalking her around, the SA-X, and it looks like her.

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.140
And then, of course, there's some Metroids involved.

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:58.140
I don't want to... Well, okay, I'm going to go ahead and spoil it because it's been out for freaking ever.

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:04.140
The animals that you save at the end of Super Metroid save you.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:08.140
Always save the animals. They come back to save your ass.

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:17.140
But anyway, going a bit more into the story about this is that Nintendo confirmed a GBA Metroid game in 2001.

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:24.140
Ken Lobb, which is Nintendo of America's director of game development, confirmed that it was a new game, not a port.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:33.140
And they showed footage at 2001 E3 under the name of Metroid 4, and it had Samus in a dark suit, running on walls and ceilings.

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:37.140
It was more simple, a little more Game Boy color-like.

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:44.140
And then, of course, it had all been updated as of EA E3 2002.

01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:52.140
It was... I mean, basically, it mimics Super Metroid being designed by the two team.

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:56.140
It was also the first 2D Metroid game that had animated cutscenes.

01:17:56.140 --> 01:18:05.140
And it was written and directed by Sakamoto Yoshio, who was the series' designer.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:12.140
So it was just... The big thing is that they wanted to do a very original story for it.

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:18.140
They wanted to do something that people hadn't played before, even though it was just a previous Metroid game.

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:25.140
So they altered the story and they put in the idea of the parasites.

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:28.140
I mean, it is not an easy game, I'll tell you that right now.

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:40.140
But at any rate, for all of the cutscenes, the music needed to fit the dialogue.

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:47.140
And so that's why the music is a little bit more serious and ambient rather than melodic.

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:51.140
Because it needed to be something that would go in with this.

01:18:52.140 --> 01:19:05.140
They wanted to look for voice actors, but really the only voices that were used was announcements for ROM cartridge limitations.

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:11.140
So the game did come out November 18th, 2002. August 22nd, 2002.

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:16.140
Nintendo announced that it would be able to connect to Metroid Prime on GameCube.

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:26.140
And there's also a two-disc soundtrack album, which is the Prime Infusion original soundtracks done by Skitron.

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:31.140
And it had also some arranged tracks on there, which was really nice.

01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:39.140
It was re-released for Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console as part of the 3DS Ambassadors program.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:43.140
It was one of ten Game Boy Advance games that was included.

01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:55.140
And then Iwata himself actually revealed that Metroid Fusion was going to be among the first three Game Boy Advance games to be released on the Wii U Virtual Console.

01:19:55.140 --> 01:20:02.140
At any rate, like I said, it's been super, super well received.

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:05.140
Famitsu gave it a 34 out of 40. Pretty good.

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:11.140
Everywhere else it's like 10 out of 10, 9 out of 10, 8 out of 10, 88%.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:17.140
I think the lowest score on this is roughly an 85%.

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:23.140
Metacritic gave it a 92 out of 100. Game rankings is 91.23%.

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:27.140
It's been considered, like I said, the Handheld Game of the Year.

01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:38.140
It was chosen as Best Game Boy Adventure game by IGN, Best Action Game on the Game Boy Advance by GameSpot.

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:44.140
It was runner-up for GameSpot's Best Sound, Best Graphics, Best Story, and overall Game of the Year.

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:50.140
As far as sales go, it has sold over 1.6 million units worldwide in its debut week.

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:59.140
It sold more than 100,000 units in North America and finished November with 199,723 copies sold in the U.S. alone.

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:11.140
Total revenue was $5,590,768 and it made it the third best selling Game Boy Advance game that month and 10th best over all gaming platforms.

01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:18.140
It went on to sell 940,000 copies by August of 2006.

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.140
Revenue is exceeding $27 million.

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:36.140
As of 2006 in America, it was the 21st highest selling game for any of the present handheld systems at that time, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, or PSP.

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:42.140
It's actually sold quite well in Japan as well as in 2004. It sold 180,000 units in Japan.

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:52.140
And then, of course, like I said, it has a sequel. Metroid Dread is this game's direct sequel developed by Nintendo and Mercury Steam.

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.140
And that's it.

01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:01.140
For sure.

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:14.140
There you go.

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:30.140
Yeah, let's talk about the free with your subscription games you can get through PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold.

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:41.140
So with PlayStation Plus, we're going to be getting Ark Survival Evolved, Team Sonic Racing and Ghosts of Tsushima Legends on PlayStation 4.

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:49.140
And then on PlayStation 5, Ghost Runner and then Ghosts of Tsushima Legends as well there.

01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:57.140
And then, of course, let's see the Xbox games with gold.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:09.140
We're going to be getting looks like the Flame in the Flood and Sacred 2 Fallen Angel, Street Power Soccer and SpongeBob's Truth or Square.

01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:14.140
And those are the games that are available through that service as well.

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:23.140
I actually I've been forgetting to download these games or mark them in my catalog, especially with Game Pass and stuff.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:27.140
It's kind of out of the way, especially if you're not on console to do that.

01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:30.140
You have to go to the Xbox store and stuff.

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:35.140
And I just want to say a quick before you get to the next story, a quick sorry for the unexpected silence there.

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.140
I was hard muted through OBS.

01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:40.140
You got you guys could hear me on Discord and that's why the show kept moving.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.140
But the listeners were like, you're muted, you're muted.

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:46.140
And that's just one of those things we're getting used to with the new space.

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.140
Sorry, y'all. We'll get there.

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:55.140
And then out of the blue, there's a new Portal game sort of coming out.

01:23:55.140 --> 01:24:00.140
So Aperture Death Job is a simulator game that's being put out.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.140
I thought you said Aperture Death Job.

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:03.140
And I was like, oh, exciting.

01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:05.140
No, no, Death Job.

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.140
And that's coming out for free on March 1st.

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:15.140
And it's made, I think, for the Steam Deck.

01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:21.140
They made it for that, but I'm assuming that you can play it on other things as well.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:28.140
Curious, though, I'm wondering if this is just a thing to kind of promote the Steam Deck

01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:35.140
or if this is like a teaser for a Portal 3 type of thing, like an ARG or something.

01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:40.140
But I guess we will have to find out once it comes out March 1st.

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:42.140
Don't tease me like that.

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:43.140
But I hope so.

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:45.140
It looks silly either way.

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:46.140
Yeah.

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.140
Be a fun one to stream.

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:50.140
Dark Soccer.

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:55.140
So I got everything hidden by my camera is the problem.

01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:57.140
Let me respond to Bobby real quick.

01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.140
Sorry.

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:00.140
Saying they stated it was just a tech demo.

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.140
You mean GLaDOS might lie to us?

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.140
Sorry, Jamie.

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:08.140
Uh-huh.

01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:16.140
Anyway, so Nintendo Switch Online has fixed Ocarina of Time's water temple room

01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:19.140
and the Paper Mario wot crash.

01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:25.140
So the I'm losing like every window in front of me.

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:32.140
The fix actually went live.

01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:35.140
I apologize.

01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:38.140
I'm actually having 50,000.

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:41.140
I was having 50,000 things open at the same time.

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:43.140
I clicked the wrong thing.

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:46.140
I can see your screen flashing so I can tell something crazy is going on.

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:48.140
Yeah, no, I clicked something.

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:51.140
And I don't know what it was so sorry about it.

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:58.140
Anyway, they also have added Majora's Mask as a new game.

01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:01.140
And like I said, fixed those other things.

01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:08.140
They've also made sure that they also did other improvements of Ocarina of Time

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:10.140
as far as its playability.

01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:13.140
Other news.

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:15.140
And this one I'm pretty excited about.

01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:17.140
Now I have backed this game.

01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.140
I am looking forward to it.

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:23.140
Called Drag Her, which is a drag queen fighting game.

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:27.140
And they just got Ben DiLaCreme for it.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.140
And that makes me happy.

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:31.140
The little teaser is so funny.

01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:36.140
The computer's like, are you going to quit in the middle of the competition?

01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:38.140
Only if I'm winning.

01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:40.140
That was pretty great.

01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:45.140
But yeah, some of the other ones like it has Tammy Brown in it and Jiggly.

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:49.140
And who else did I see in there?

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:50.140
Oh, Kimchi.

01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.140
Alaska was in there, right?

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:52.140
Alaska, yeah.

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:56.140
Any non-Drag Race drag queens or is they pretty much relying on that franchise

01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:59.140
to help bring the visibility to the game?

01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.140
Well, I think honestly this is the best way to get visibility for it

01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:07.140
is to focus on the big names that everyone knows.

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:08.140
Oh, guess who else actually?

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.140
Landon Thider is in it.

01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:11.140
Okay, that's cool.

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:13.140
Okay, so a Dragula, a king in it.

01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:14.140
That's cool.

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:15.140
Okay.

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.140
So I think that's really awesome because, I mean, Landon Thider,

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:23.140
having seen him perform, super talented king there.

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:24.140
Yeah.

01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.140
Cool.

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:26.140
Yeah.

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.140
All right.

01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:29.140
Pretty cool about that.

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.140
All right.

01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:33.140
And with that, we're going to travel around the world and check out some games

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:37.140
you can play a little sooner than drag queen fighting games,

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:39.140
as much as I know you're looking forward to that, Loki.

01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.140
Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.?

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.140
I am very much looking forward to that.

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.140
You got to try it at least once.

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:49.140
Well, you know, not the drag queen fighting games, but there's that.

01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:52.140
I don't know if it's a drag queen game, but that that.

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:57.140
Oh, God, it's it's a FPS game that's done like the style of like Doom,

01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:01.140
but it's like you're making people fabulous, like putting clothes on them

01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:03.140
or something. You have a clothes gun.

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:04.140
So there's that.

01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:05.140
I don't remember that.

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.140
Yeah.

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:07.140
Yes, a five shooter.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.140
What is something like that?

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:09.140
Yeah, like I can't remember.

01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:11.140
I swear I've had it.

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.140
I've had it.

01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.140
I think they actually have that.

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:16.140
But I think I actually had that to work.

01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:17.140
I don't know what this game is.

01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:19.140
Jack, get to work.

01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:21.140
I had it in my background for a while.

01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:24.140
I can I could tell you what the game is because I have it on my steam wish list,

01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:32.140
but it is.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.140
Fashion police squad.

01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:35.140
That sounds awesome.

01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:36.140
Yes.

01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:37.140
Yes.

01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:38.140
It's coming out sometime this year.

01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:43.140
OK, so something we can do here now

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.140
that I couldn't do before.

01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:47.140
So this is and this is something on steam.

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:48.140
Yes.

01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.140
OK. Oh, my gosh.

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:51.140
What the heck is this?

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:52.140
OK, let's see.

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:56.140
So I'm going to I'm going to fast forward here and then we're going to do that.

01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:59.140
And you do see them cut out for just a minute.

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:02.140
But now I can actually see the game.

01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:05.140
OK, so

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.140
so sorry.

01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.140
This does not make great for podcast.

01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:11.140
So it's definitely what Loki was describing.

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:16.140
It's a first person shooter and it looks like it's very pixelated.

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:18.140
Oh, the fashion police dispatch.

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:20.140
We have this is Officer Dez.

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:23.140
There's a thin red ribbon blocking my way to the crime scene.

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:24.140
This is ridiculous.

01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:25.140
I love it.

01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:26.140
I have to check that out.

01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:27.140
That's funny.

01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:28.140
All right.

01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:32.140
And yes, I and hopefully I can make that work a little smoother in the future,

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.140
but I can actually do drop in YouTube's now.

01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:35.140
So that'll be fun.

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:37.140
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:40.140
Anyways, so back to release dates, though.

01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:46.140
So this week we've got Guild Wars two end of dragons coming out on PC.

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:49.140
LX two.

01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:51.140
And did I just show my.

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:54.140
Or are you like to.

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:59.140
That's on a PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:05.140
far the changing tides on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:10.140
Shadow Warrior three on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:16.140
Babylon's fall on PC, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:19.140
And then, of course, the big ones for the week.

01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:26.140
Gran Turismo seven on PlayStation four and PlayStation five and triangle strategy on Nintendo Switch.

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:30.140
Why is triangle man now playing in my head?

01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:35.140
Because I said trying the things a triangle can.

01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:36.140
Sorry.

01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:37.140
Sorry for the chaos.

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.140
I'm sure that I was trying to particle man.

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:42.140
My discord notifications are coming through on stream, so I was trying to mute those.

01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:44.140
So you guys wouldn't hear those about that.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:45.140
Put yourself in the stream mode.

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:46.140
Yeah.

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:47.140
And then I end up showing.

01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:54.140
Thank God my phone number is mostly blocked out because it just totally not to shine a light on it, but it totally did.

01:30:54.140 --> 01:31:03.140
So anyway, let's move on to Japan and talk about the releases there this week in Japan.

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:05.140
We also have triangle strategy getting released there.

01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:07.140
That's pretty cool.

01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.140
And that is pretty much the big release on the Nintendo Switch.

01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:11.140
There's not a lot else to look forward to on the switch.

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:19.140
But if you go to the PlayStation five, we also have Babylon's fall, which is coming out there and Gran Turismo seven, kind of a big deal.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:23.140
And the rotten city is coming out on the PlayStation five as well.

01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:26.140
So busy week in Japan, dark Sakura.

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:27.140
How about the UK?

01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:31.140
It's not super busy, but busy ish on the first.

01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:39.140
We have Alex to on console for PlayStation, Xbox and PC.

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:44.140
We have on the third Babylon's fall for PlayStation on the fourth.

01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:46.140
We have a lot more.

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:48.140
We have Gran Turismo seven.

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:54.140
We have triangle strategy for Switch Ryan's rescue squad for the big three.

01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:58.140
We have Ash Walker's for Switch, which actually looks kind of cool.

01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:02.140
We have Death's Gambit afterlife also on Switch.

01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:06.140
And that is it for that week.

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:07.140
All right.

01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:13.140
Just a few more stories for you, and then we're going to get to the listener roundtable and see how that goes tonight with this new setup.

01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:14.140
We'll see.

01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:16.140
I don't even have a scene for discord.

01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:17.140
I'll have to build one on the fly.

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.140
We'll see how that goes.

01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:21.140
Meanwhile, though, we will get to our next story.

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:22.140
Loki.

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:31.140
Yeah, so there's news regarding Call of Duty, and that is that there's not going to be a Call of Duty in 2023.

01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:34.140
They're going to be taken a year off.

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:42.140
It's probably not so much that they're well, obviously, you know, they need some time to, you know, kind of work on the game.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:46.140
It's not like that they're not going to be doing any Call of Duty content during that time.

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:50.140
They're actually going to be working on more of the Warzone stuff.

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:59.140
So there'll be stuff being done through their free to play game, but no mainline Call of Duty game that's going to be coming out in 2023.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:03.140
So they'll be skipping that.

01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:04.140
And then what else?

01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:13.140
So also to go along with the unfortunate Activision news.

01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:31.140
So the Call of Duty executives, I guess, or the Activision Blizzard folks, there is filings within the SEC that withheld some important information regarding the money that they're going to be getting from the merger.

01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:40.140
So it sounds like that there's some of these execs are just trying to stay around for six to eight months after the deal goes through.

01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:49.140
And they're going to get millions of dollars for, you know, some of these folks haven't even been tenured for a year or so.

01:33:49.140 --> 01:34:08.140
But you know, for example, they've got their chief financial officer is getting $25.3 million, their chief operating officer $29 million, the administration officer 11.3 billion and legal officer $14.7 million.

01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:13.140
And of course, Bobby Kotick is receiving quite a bit as well.

01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:14.140
How convenient.

01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:15.140
$20 million.

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:16.140
Yeah.

01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:17.140
God.

01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:32.140
So basically, yeah, so the SEC filing, it alleges that the deal is better for Activision Blizzard executives and board members than it is for the average investor.

01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:33.140
Which, yeah, I agree.

01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:39.140
You know, because when I if I buy stock in Activision, I'm like getting $20 million.

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:43.140
So already not as good as what I should be getting.

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:44.140
All right.

01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:46.140
I need some news that's a little bit happier.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:49.140
Dark Soccer, if you could entertain me in that department, please.

01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:50.140
So something better news.

01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:52.140
Oh, yeah, totally better news.

01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:57.140
This will better except for one way my wallet.

01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:00.140
So, yeah, because this ain't cheap.

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:04.140
And you didn't get those bonuses that Loki was just talking about.

01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:05.140
Oh, God.

01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:08.140
So let me just go go on this.

01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:14.140
So Multimorphic has announced they are doing Weird Al's Museum of Natural Hilarity.

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:15.140
I am stoked.

01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:18.140
Like, Dan woke me up and told me about this.

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:28.140
OK, so at any rate, it is going to be on the P3 system.

01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:38.140
Which what P3 is, it's a modular a modular pinball table with a LCD screen underneath

01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:39.140
it.

01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:41.140
So you have interactive elements with the play field.

01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.140
It looks really cool.

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.140
Yeah, they're really cool.

01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:47.140
Well, I've played two of the games on there.

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:52.140
I played Lexi Lightspeed and I played whatever that second one came out was.

01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:56.140
There's another one called Heist that's supposed to be a lot better than the other two, although

01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:58.140
I really enjoyed Lexi Lightspeed.

01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:05.140
But this is going to be the fourth in that series, as far as I'm aware.

01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:12.140
And I mean, I really am just like completely stoked about it.

01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:18.140
They got out, of course, to do all the voices, all the call outs, everything about it.

01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:25.140
I am absolutely just completely, completely, completely floored by this.

01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:35.140
And then also, you know, there's going to be a deluxe version of this that's going

01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:38.140
to have an animated topper on it.

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:39.140
That looks awesome.

01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:41.140
Yeah, well, we are going to get that one.

01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:42.140
So that's the thing.

01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:43.140
We are we are going to get that.

01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:57.140
And the thing is, is that, OK, so the base P3 machine costs about $8,300.

01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:06.140
The module for Weird Al's Museum of Natural Hilarity is $3,000.

01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:14.140
The limited edition package is an additional $1,800.

01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:20.140
So we are looking at roughly $14,000 for this pinball.

01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:21.140
It's a car.

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:22.140
Roughly.

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:23.140
It's a car.

01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:24.140
It's amazing.

01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:26.140
That's hardly a car?

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.140
A used car.

01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:33.140
That's buying a Yaris.

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:34.140
Game not.

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:44.140
Anyway, they also have other little upgrades, which we're also considering doing.

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:48.140
We want to get the enhanced flipper assembly.

01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:54.140
We want to get all of the other major upgrades.

01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:59.140
And I'm actually even kind of thinking about asking for Lexi light speed as well.

01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:03.140
But we would probably just keep it permanently as Weird Al.

01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:11.140
The orders for it are, are they already up or are they going up on the fourth?

01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:13.140
I think they're going up on the fourth.

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.140
I'm actually going through the thing.

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.140
Yeah, I'm not seeing the date on it.

01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:29.140
But like the song list has Amish Paradise, Like a Surgeon, My Balona, White Nerdy, Word Crimes, Dare to be Stupid, Germs, Fun Zone, Hardware Store, Harvey the Wonder Hamster.

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:33.140
And by the way, Harvey the Wonder Hamster is on his hamster wheel in the game.

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:35.140
It's awesome.

01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:42.140
El Sousa, Mission Statement, Sports Song, Traffic Jam, Weasel Stomping Day, UHF, and You Make Me.

01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:44.140
UHF, there's a UHF mode in it.

01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:49.140
Okay, for those who do not know, UHF is very important to my marriage.

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:51.140
Do you know why?

01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:54.140
Because of the reception you drank from the fire hose.

01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:57.140
No, but we did find the marble in the oatmeal.

01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:06.140
Anyway, when Dan and I got engaged, we were watching UHF on VHS.

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.140
No, I take that back. It was on DVD.

01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:10.140
We were watching UHF.

01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:19.140
We were drinking Manischewitz blackberry wine and cheap French bread and spinach dip from the grocery store.

01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:21.140
We were broke as a joke back in those days.

01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:24.140
But then we were like, you can get married.

01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:26.140
Sure, eventually.

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:28.140
That was exactly how the proposal went.

01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:32.140
I don't really remember who told who what, but we just decided.

01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:34.140
Very romantic.

01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:43.140
But years later, for our 10th anniversary, we went to see Weird Al with the mandatory fun tour.

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:47.140
We had front row seats and everything.

01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:51.140
We brought him our DVD copy of UHF.

01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:53.140
He signed it.

01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:56.140
We told him the story.

01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:58.140
And he's like, and you haven't divorced yet?

01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:06.140
It was really cool.

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:08.140
Al is a sweetheart in person.

01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:13.140
I'm very, very, very happy that something like this has come along.

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:18.140
I never expected a Weird Al pinball table.

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.140
Never in a million.

01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:25.140
I'm so intensely pleased that all thoughts of Rush have left my head.

01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:31.140
Sorry, I love Rush, but Weird Al has a very special place in this household.

01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:33.140
Very special place.

01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:40.140
What are your thoughts on the documentary that they're putting together with Daniel Radcliffe playing Weird Al?

01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.140
That's not a documentary, Loki.

01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:47.140
It's a mockumentary, I guess.

01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:52.140
A biopic is usually what you would call this, yeah.

01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:55.140
I don't know.

01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:57.140
Probably very silly.

01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:59.140
Everything should be very silly.

01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:00.140
I can't wait.

01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:02.140
We have so much Weird Al stuff.

01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:09.140
Not like hyper collectors, but I have a copy on VHS, because it's the only way you can get it, of the complete Al.

01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:13.140
As in spelled Z-O-M-P-L-E-A-T.

01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:22.140
We've got box sets, I've got mandatory fun on vinyl autographed playing cards from the tour.

01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:27.140
And we got our tour shirts and everything.

01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:34.140
We were hoping that, well actually for our 15th anniversary, we were going to go to New Orleans.

01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:39.140
And we said if we couldn't go to New Orleans, we'd go to another Weird Al thing, but COVID.

01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:42.140
So we got iPads instead.

01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:57.140
But anyway, going back to that, there's going to be a showing of it at the Texas Pinball Festival in Frisco, Texas, March 25th through 27th.

01:41:57.140 --> 01:42:02.140
And if anybody goes to that, oh my god, just play it.

01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:13.140
I want to see if Pina Gogo or the Golden State Pinball Fair that we do here that Dan and I work at, if they can get it.

01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:22.140
Because we get Stern and Jersey Jack to display tables, so maybe we can get Multimorphic to come.

01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:24.140
That'd be awesome.

01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:25.140
Awesome.

01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:27.140
I'm so excited.

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:29.140
This has never happened during OLR.

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:35.140
Maybe I can hope I don't show too much mess, but I'm going to pan down a little bit.

01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:38.140
This has never, never happened.

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:40.140
Oh, he just, and now he's decided he's over.

01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:42.140
He knew the camera.

01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:44.140
He knew the camera was on him.

01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:45.140
It's on the VOD.

01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:46.140
Fuck it.

01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:47.140
I'm leaving.

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:48.140
Clip it.

01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:50.140
Clip it.

01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:51.140
Okay.

01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:55.140
That has never, ever happened during OLR.

01:42:55.140 --> 01:43:04.140
I'm glad of the delay because I unpaused the internet version and I got to see it.

01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:07.140
And I was just a second short of screenshotting it.

01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.140
What a little asshole.

01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:09.140
Look at this.

01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:10.140
Look at this.

01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:11.140
He did all that.

01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:12.140
Oh, damn it.

01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:13.140
I can't.

01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:14.140
Sorry.

01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:15.140
My place is still a mess.

01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:16.140
Don't judge me.

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:17.140
It's all right.

01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:18.140
You just moved.

01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:19.140
He's lying down.

01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:20.140
I do this.

01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:21.140
He's just lying down, passed out.

01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:22.140
Do you see him?

01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:24.140
Do you see him being a drama queen over there?

01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:25.140
Yeah, I see him.

01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:31.140
He just decided to go lie down right over there just to be a fucking drama queen.

01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:33.140
And now I'm not going to get my shot back the way it was.

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.140
All right.

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:38.140
I have so many pictures of other people's animals from streams.

01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:42.140
Mostly I have pictures of Losing Colors dog, Odin.

01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:44.140
But I'm mildly obsessed with Odin.

01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:47.140
I can never touch a husky due to allergies.

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:49.140
But I'm obsessed with that dog.

01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:53.140
So I'm so excited for Alan to start streaming because he actually set his up.

01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:56.140
So the cat bed is on there.

01:43:56.140 --> 01:44:00.140
So he's ready for a cat cam for when smush goes in there.

01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:01.140
So we'll see.

01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:02.140
We'll see.

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:08.140
I'm actually considering doing the same if I had an extra port to do it with is Midna

01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:13.140
no longer will sleep on the chair behind me, but she sleeps in my work chair.

01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:19.140
And I put a white towel down on the chair behind me so that Midna would show up on camera.

01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:20.140
So.

01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:28.140
The best game ready for the best getting rig ready for stream scene that I saw on YouTube

01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:35.140
by Willie Mosbin had his cat licking a plexiglass like it was like a transparent plexiglass

01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:37.140
thing with cat food on it.

01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:40.140
And that that was his like getting ready for stream thing.

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:42.140
It was amazing.

01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:43.140
That's fantastic.

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:44.140
That's great.

01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:48.140
The one thing that sadly isn't coming through on stream so well and I just it's a lighting

01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:50.140
thing, but you can probably see behind me.

01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:55.140
I actually have orange lights in here, but it just needs to get lit up better.

01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:57.140
I need to figure out how to make kind of red.

01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:59.140
Yeah, that's right on.

01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:01.140
Well, they and they change colors.

01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:05.140
So you can actually I think if I just hit the change colors, you could actually have

01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:06.140
a difference.

01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.140
That's red.

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:08.140
So there's a little more.

01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:12.140
I have two color changing bars, but the only place that I could put them was on the opposite

01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:14.140
side of my camera.

01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:15.140
So.

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:21.140
But you know what, you know what I would suggest doing are those hexagon lights.

01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:23.140
Oh, that'll be cool.

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.140
We'll see.

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:25.140
We'll see on the back wall.

01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:30.140
I wanted to do like lights that you could change on Twitch when I'm streaming, but we'll

01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.140
see.

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.140
We'll see.

01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:33.140
Sorry.

01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:34.140
Talk to me.

01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:36.140
I found a place to get some of those bulbs cheap.

01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:37.140
And thank you.

01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:38.140
I see the clips coming in.

01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:39.140
Yeah.

01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:40.140
I'll look at those later.

01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:43.140
Plus, I want to show them to Alan, so be funny.

01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:44.140
All right.

01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:45.140
Let's move on.

01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:46.140
We still have some more stories.

01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:49.140
I think one more from Loki.

01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:54.140
Right, Loki?

01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:55.140
Yeah.

01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:56.140
Sorry.

01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:57.140
I was checking out the camera.

01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:58.140
Oh, you're watching the clip.

01:45:58.140 --> 01:45:59.140
I understand.

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:00.140
I understand.

01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:01.140
And we'll take the podcast.

01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:03.140
Folks, go over to twitch.tv slash vlog network.

01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:07.140
And now there's a clip there of two of them actually about Smoosh in the new studio.

01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:10.140
So I'm downloading it, by the way, so I can send it to you.

01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:12.140
Oh, it's something you can watch.

01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:19.140
Unlike watching Super Smash Brothers at Evo this year, because it's not going to be there,

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:20.140
unfortunately.

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:27.140
Nintendo has decided this year that they are not going to be including Super Smash Brothers

01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:29.140
in Evo.

01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:36.140
And apparently that they're hoping to be able to, you know, work with them again soon.

01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:40.140
I don't know if this is because Evo was purchased by Sony.

01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:44.140
And so maybe there's like some kind of, you know, confusion there.

01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:48.140
It's probably something behind the scenes, some sort of like arrangement that's going

01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:52.140
on, that maybe it was more favorable for Sony than Nintendo.

01:46:52.140 --> 01:47:00.140
But for whatever reason, I want to say just like since that story was published, like

01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:05.140
Nintendo has come out and talking about their own plans for Smash and that whole thing.

01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:09.140
I don't know if that was somebody reporting on an earlier tweet or what, but I want to

01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:12.140
say like multiple tournaments, like I agree.

01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:13.140
I agree with you.

01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:14.140
It's it's silly.

01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:17.140
And I don't I don't think Sony's the one stopping it, though.

01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:18.140
I really don't.

01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:20.140
Just because they knew what they were buying.

01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:24.140
And I don't see what they have to gain from that happening.

01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:28.140
And I guess we can have a hand Nickelodeon All-Stars Brawl there.

01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:29.140
Right.

01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:30.140
I guess.

01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:32.140
Who knows what's going to replace it?

01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:35.140
That would be really funny, though.

01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.140
All right.

01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:39.140
And one more story for you guys tonight.

01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:43.140
And I thought this was funny because we just talked about this on the show two weeks ago,

01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:44.140
maybe three.

01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:48.140
But we had talked about, hey, what did what did that guy from that made the Nestle emulator?

01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:49.140
What did he end up doing?

01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:50.140
Right.

01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:53.140
And we had found out, oh, he went to work for EA and he was working on some of those

01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:59.140
things because there was a GitHub thing about the emulator that was buried away.

01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:01.140
So he had like a super Nestle that he'd written.

01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:04.140
And basically that code was in an EA game on the GameCube.

01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:05.140
Right.

01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:06.140
And it was buried away from a few weeks ago.

01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:07.140
Yeah.

01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:13.140
Well, I guess this guy is suddenly getting like exposure all over again, because what's

01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:20.140
interesting is that on GitHub, he has now released a new NES emulator.

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:25.140
And as pointed out in our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, the NES has

01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:28.140
been emulated pretty perfectly at this point.

01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:29.140
Right.

01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:33.140
Emulators have come a long way since Nestle in the late 90s, early aughts.

01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:37.140
Like the emulators are in a really good place now when it comes to the NES.

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:40.140
Here's what makes this one really interesting.

01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:46.140
It's a transistor emulator, so it emulates down to the transistors.

01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:52.140
It only runs on OS X right now, which I also think is kind of hardcore, but that's that's

01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:53.140
what they're doing.

01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:56.140
And that would be, by the way, OS X.

01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:57.140
Sorry.

01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:06.140
But they're saying also it's efforts involved with Visual 2 CO2 and Visual 2 AOC3.

01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:10.140
Actually, something bothers me because we're technically not on OS X anymore.

01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:12.140
We're like on OS 12.

01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:17.140
I assumed that was the other old ass operating system, not Mac.

01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:19.140
I thought it was the actual OS.

01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:20.140
What did they call that?

01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:22.140
I thought it was called OS X.

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:24.140
No, it was Mac OS X.

01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:25.140
No, no, no.

01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:26.140
I'm not talking about a Mac system.

01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:27.140
I'm talking about a...

01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:30.140
Well, I don't think it's Linux.

01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:33.140
Am I going crazy?

01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:34.140
Yeah.

01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:37.140
No, it's OS X, Mac OS X.

01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:38.140
Okay.

01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:41.140
I thought there was something.

01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:43.140
My brain is mixing it up with something else.

01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:44.140
But okay.

01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:45.140
Yeah.

01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:49.140
So for whatever reason, that is the platform it's running on now.

01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:52.140
It must be what he has access to, or maybe he just has a really...

01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:54.140
Was I thinking of OS X?

01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:55.140
I guess I was.

01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:56.140
I was thinking of OS 2.

01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:57.140
You might have been thinking of OS 2.

01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:58.140
I was thinking of OS 2.

01:49:58.140 --> 01:49:59.140
I sure was.

01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:01.140
And I was like, damn, that's hardcore.

01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:02.140
Okay.

01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:03.140
There we go.

01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:04.140
That is it.

01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.140
It's OS 2 I was thinking of.

01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:08.140
I think the last OS X was two years ago.

01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:09.140
Okay.

01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:13.140
So anyway, it's running at the transistor level, which is pretty wild.

01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:16.140
And yeah, you could check that out if you want.

01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:21.140
And some folks in a Reddit thread about this are pointing out, transistor level emulation,

01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:26.140
that is like 100% software emulation without emulating quantum effects.

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:27.140
It's almost perfect.

01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:31.140
Of course, it takes more system resources, but you want to talk about perfect emulation.

01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:32.140
There you go.

01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:35.140
So this is still probably early on, but it's interesting.

01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.140
He put it on GitHub.

01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:39.140
So who knows what we're going to see come from this.

01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:41.140
It's very exciting.

01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:50.140
So just when we thought NES emulation was perfect, it's going to get more perfect.

01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:52.140
All right.

01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:56.140
Anyhow, that is the last story that we had on the agenda tonight.

01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:59.140
But there's always what you guys have to talk about.

01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:00.140
The listener round table.

01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:02.140
If you guys want to, you can try to call.

01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:07.140
I'll try to make that happen over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:09.140
And then of course we have our mailbag.

01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:11.140
I don't know if we've gotten anything in the past two weeks.

01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:12.140
I have to check with...

01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:13.140
No.

01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:14.140
We got spam.

01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:15.140
I deleted it.

01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:17.140
I have a last minute story.

01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:18.140
I think some of it was in Dutch.

01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:19.140
We'll get to that.

01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:24.140
But participate at orangesontrader.com if you want to send us emails for a future week.

01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:27.140
Usually when we don't get emails, we talk about Drag Race.

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:31.140
But the only thing I have to say that's Drag Race related is tangina heels.

01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:33.140
End of sentence.

01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:34.140
All right.

01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:37.140
The icon, the legend, and the moment.

01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:39.140
Loki, you had a last minute story.

01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:40.140
Why don't we get to that?

01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:44.140
So Konami, being the geniuses that they are...

01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:45.140
Oh, shit.

01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:49.140
They forgot to renew the domain for silenthill.com.

01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:52.140
And it got snatched up by somebody else.

01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:58.140
And now if you go to silenthill.com, there is a screenshot of a tweet from Masahiro Ito

01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:02.140
saying, I wish I hadn't decided effing Pyramid Ed.

01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:03.140
Wow.

01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:04.140
That's it.

01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:06.140
That is beautiful.

01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:07.140
That is...

01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:09.140
I'm putting this on my Twitter right now.

01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:12.140
That is something else.

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:13.140
Huh.

01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:16.140
Are they going to hold it ransom or something?

01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:20.140
Or is it just like a fuck Konami type of thing or that sort of situation?

01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:21.140
I don't know.

01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:23.140
Apparently they did the same thing in 2019 too.

01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:29.140
They let it lapse for a second and forgot to renew it.

01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:36.140
Because there's also a screenshot of a tweet from some guy named Bob Vids on Twitter.

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:38.140
It says, so silenthill.com domain is available.

01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:41.140
And that was from December 6, 2019.

01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:43.140
That's fricking hilarious.

01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:44.140
Yeah.

01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:45.140
All right.

01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:47.140
No Konami.

01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:49.140
Oh boy.

01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:55.140
So anything else we want to talk about here before we move to wrap up tonight?

01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:56.140
I feel like it's early.

01:52:56.140 --> 01:52:58.140
We haven't even really been on air two hours, but...

01:52:58.140 --> 01:52:59.140
It is.

01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:02.140
Like I'm normally...

01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:03.140
Wow.

01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:04.140
I know, right?

01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:06.140
We could touch on some of the other headlines from last week.

01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:07.140
Let me go...

01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:09.140
Yeah, what happened?

01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:10.140
There was some other stuff too.

01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:11.140
We can...

01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:12.140
Unless you already have it up, Loki.

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:13.140
I'll pull up the...

01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:14.140
I'm working on it.

01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:15.140
Behind the scenes.

01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:19.140
I don't know why y'all posted stories because you knew there wasn't a show last week, but

01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:20.140
both of you...

01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:21.140
I forgot.

01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:22.140
I didn't.

01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:23.140
It's a force of habit.

01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:24.140
Oh no, I know you did.

01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:25.140
I'm sorry.

01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:26.140
I meant in the thread there was that.

01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:28.140
Which I don't have access to anymore.

01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:30.140
No, it's a force of habit.

01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:31.140
So that's why I did it.

01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:32.140
No, it's all good.

01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:33.140
It's fine.

01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:34.140
I'm not actually...

01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:36.140
Yeah, I can cover some of the stuff that was in there.

01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:37.140
I do have it up.

01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:38.140
I do have it up.

01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:44.140
Let's see, the first season of Chocobo GP is going to be free for full game players

01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:45.140
and has Cloud and Squall in it.

01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:49.140
I'm still interested in Chocobo GP, but the whole season thing and some of that free to

01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:52.140
play stuff is really worrying.

01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:55.140
Puzzle and Dragons came out for Nintendo Switch.

01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:56.140
That's cool.

01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:57.140
I didn't even...

01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:58.140
That wasn't on my radar.

01:53:58.140 --> 01:53:59.140
That's pretty rad.

01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:03.140
Super Metroid got a new save point near the end of the game.

01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:04.140
What?

01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:05.140
Thank God.

01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:06.140
No, it's the...

01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:11.140
You know how they do that in the Nintendo online app and stuff like that where they

01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:16.140
have those special modes that you can play that's kind of a save state?

01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:17.140
It's that.

01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:18.140
Oh, it's just SP.

01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:19.140
Okay.

01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:20.140
I thought...

01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:21.140
Yeah, the SP.

01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:22.140
What?

01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:23.140
They added...

01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:24.140
Okay, I get it.

01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.140
I get it.

01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:26.140
Okay, cool.

01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:27.140
That's still neat.

01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:28.140
Those SP releases are cute.

01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:31.140
It allows you to do things that you probably can't do anymore, but you were able to do

01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:32.140
it as a kid.

01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:37.640
That's me in that Kid Icarus SP that lets you play the last level that's like a shooter.

01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:38.640
What the fuck?

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.640
Out of nowhere.

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:41.340
The last level is a shooter level.

01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:44.660
You can play that now because me trying to actually beat that game in this day and age,

01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:46.380
very difficult.

01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:47.380
Very difficult.

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:48.380
In this economy?

01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:50.260
In this economy.

01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:53.500
It was confirmed that NFTs are not coming out to Final Fantasy XIV.

01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:56.140
I thought that had come up two weeks ago, but it's in the list here.

01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:57.420
Oh, Dark Sakura.

01:54:57.420 --> 01:54:58.420
I know.

01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:01.060
The reveal of Sadako from Reimu.

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:04.380
Did we talk about that two weeks ago?

01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:05.380
Was the PTB out at that time?

01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:06.380
I don't know if the PTB was out.

01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:10.740
The PTB came out that Tuesday, so we got all the talents and all that came out.

01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:11.740
That's what it was.

01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:12.740
That's right.

01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:16.660
We found out the survivor is the child grown up, which is interesting.

01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:17.660
Yoichi.

01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:21.060
Yeah, it was not the character or anything there.

01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:22.860
Which was Reiko's son.

01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:24.860
Pretty cool.

01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:35.220
Yeah, I love the aesthetic of Sadako on the test realm.

01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:38.460
Just the way they did her was great.

01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:40.460
She seems like she's going to have some issues as a killer.

01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:45.860
She's definitely not going to be S tier, but I think a niche killer can be really fun.

01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:55.440
Did you happen to see the render rips that I did?

01:55:55.440 --> 01:56:05.080
I know I put them out on my Discord, but they were talking about wondering just how short

01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:06.300
she was.

01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:12.340
Because right now, the two shortest killers in the game, before Sadako comes out, is Pig

01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:13.980
and Hag.

01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:18.980
And Pig is about 5'3".

01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:21.780
And I'll find a link to it and put it somewhere.

01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:28.700
But when I ripped the renders and had them all side by side, because I figured out how

01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:35.260
to do that now, Sadako is about a whole head shorter than Pig.

01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:39.300
And the only reason that Hag looks short at all is because she's hunched.

01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:42.980
But when you import her model, she's standing up straight.

01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:49.420
And we know that that is coming to the full game in early March or something like that,

01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:50.420
right?

01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:51.420
8th.

01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:56.900
All right, Loki, what else did you have that you want to talk about from last week?

01:56:56.900 --> 01:57:02.340
So there's going to be a new LEGO set for Horizon Forbidden West's Tallneck.

01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:04.140
They're going to do that, which is kind of cool.

01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:10.020
They have an official set that will be coming out in May.

01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:13.820
I believe the 22nd, which is weird, though, because usually they're at the beginning of

01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:15.620
the month, but OK.

01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:16.620
So sometime in May.

01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:19.780
That's going to come out, and it'll be about $80.

01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:23.140
I am very interested in that.

01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:24.140
What else?

01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:25.140
No Man's Sky got another update.

01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:26.140
It did.

01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:27.140
It's a combat one.

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:30.900
I've watched Alan play a little bit of it.

01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:32.660
I have not played it myself yet.

01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:39.940
I've been so busy with eight years of old house collection, unloading it.

01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:41.980
But it's crazy.

01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:44.140
If you guys saw that house today, you'd be like, what?

01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:47.180
You lived here?

01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:52.860
So I don't know if this is tied in with the new Pokemon games that were just announced,

01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:59.620
but in Pokemon Legends ArcSis, there was someone that did a free cam in that game, and they

01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:05.040
were able to find a present day room that was unused, I guess.

01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.980
It's like a bedroom that has a Nintendo Switch and a TV and stuff like that, which is kind

01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:14.220
of odd in feudal Japan, but it's there.

01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:18.820
My thought is they were going to use that in the opening sequence to render that in

01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:25.620
the engine, because if I remember right, you are in the modern times, and then you fall

01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:29.980
through a void type of thing, and that's how you end up in...

01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:35.180
It might just be that they put it in a weird spot that they never thought anybody would

01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:36.180
find.

01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:37.180
Probably.

01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:38.180
Yeah.

01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:46.140
EA executives are blaming Halo and COVID for the fact that Battlefield 2042 didn't do well.

01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:51.460
Not because the game is completely buggy and pretty much unplayable, but sure.

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:55.420
And then, of course, they came out and said, oh, no, no, no, we didn't do that, because

01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:59.500
it was an internal meeting, comments that were leaked out.

01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:05.580
Speaking of leaks, Halo Infinite, the Forge mode has leaked out from that, or at least

01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:11.860
some screenshots, so apparently that's coming, or video, I guess they have video for it,

01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:14.260
so that's something that's on its way.

01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:22.620
And then there's a Bioshock film that's in the works at Netflix, so I'm down with that,

01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:27.460
and then Sonic the Hedgehog is getting a third film and a Knuckles live-action series.

01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:30.260
Oh, I missed the news about the series.

01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:31.260
That's interesting.

01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:33.260
Yeah, on Paramount Plus.

01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:40.460
Will the series plug into the movie to make a super media experience?

01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:41.460
I don't know.

01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:42.460
Have to ask.

01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:43.460
Maybe.

01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:44.460
Have to ask.

01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:45.460
That's it.

01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:46.460
I had.

01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:52.100
Mike Defton-Chad is talking about the modern stuff that was found in Pokemon Legends, saying

01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:57.580
it seems like an unused asset, but it's also rumored to be something for a future DLC.

01:59:57.580 --> 01:59:58.580
Yeah.

01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:05.540
Sonic Cinematic Universe, hey, you put that with Detective Pikachu, the upcoming Mario

02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:06.540
movie.

02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:07.540
What else do we got?

02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:12.700
We got a Smash Brothers universe building, is my point, so just, you know, we'll see.

02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:18.660
And Mike Defton-Chad says Sonic 3 and Knuckles, but separate this time instead of together,

02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:22.500
which is kind of funny, so very cool.

02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:26.380
All right, yeah.

02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:27.900
You guys in chat are funny.

02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:31.980
All right, well, I guess with that, we're going to wrap up the show.

02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:35.420
We're a little early, but that's, you know, some weeks the show moves a little faster

02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:37.060
than others.

02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:40.100
Thank you guys for listening to our show this week, whether it was on the podcast feed or

02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:42.780
whether you were here live with us on Twitch.

02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:44.220
Really appreciate you guys being here.

02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:46.860
Thank you for bearing with us through some of the sound issues.

02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:49.260
I have some things to work on this week for sure.

02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:53.320
Not only do I want to decorate a little more behind me, which might dampen some of the

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:56.440
echoing that you're hearing, but it sounds like I might need to switch out the mic, which

02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:57.440
is a bummer.

02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:01.040
I really thought this would be a better quality, not a worse one.

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:06.480
But I'll play with that and see what we can do behind the scenes about that.

02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:09.640
And yeah, thank you very much for being here and supporting the show.

02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:12.120
If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:14.960
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:20.360
need more voices here to put out on air, that's for sure, and would always appreciate that.

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:24.400
And yeah, a nice five-star review wherever you found this podcast, whether it's iTunes,

02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:29.000
Spotify, Google, whatever it is you listen to podcasts on, super appreciate that.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:34.080
And of course, follows and all that good stuff for VOG Network over on Twitch, twitch.tv

02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:37.520
slash V-O-G network.

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:39.920
That is going to do it for tonight.

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.600
Dark Sakura, I will throw it to you.

02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.040
I imagine you are off to play Debbie Delight post-show or something.

02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.680
You said you were kind of getting burned out on Debbie.

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:49.440
Are you going to play something else?

02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:52.200
I'm still going to do Debbie.

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:57.000
Of course, you know, I just need a little bit of prep time because we're done far earlier

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.600
than I expected to be.

02:01:58.600 --> 02:01:59.600
So yeah.

02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:00.600
All right.

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:03.600
Well, have a good night.

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:06.160
Have fun killing, and we'll see you next week.

02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:07.160
Bye-bye.

02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:08.160
Everyone be well.

02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:09.160
Be kind.

02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:10.160
All right.

02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:13.320
Loki, what is your final thought for us tonight?

02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:16.120
I've got a lot of work to do in Minecraft.

02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:19.600
I got to do a lot of planning because I've been spending this week doing development

02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:23.320
of that data pack, which put me behind.

02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:26.380
So I got to get creative now.

02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:33.560
My final thought is this has been a very expensive past couple of weeks, but it feels so, so

02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:34.560
nice to be here.

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:36.200
Loki, you've got to come over at some point.

02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:37.300
Same thing goes for Dark Sakura.

02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:41.840
We were planning an Ikea trip last week, but then we realized Ikea closed an hour earlier

02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:42.840
than we thought.

02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:46.320
So she didn't end up coming out here, but I'm not saying you and I have to go to Ikea,

02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:48.840
but I do want you to see the new place at some point.

02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:49.840
Yeah, definitely.

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:50.840
It's nice.

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:53.000
I'm upstairs now, which is weird.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.280
The old house was not upstairs, downstairs.

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:56.360
This one is.

02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:58.880
So it's a little funky, but I like it.

02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:03.320
And there is, I'm just saying, I'm not saying that I planned this space for us to ever be

02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:09.480
back in person, but that is a couch behind me and the couch can move to the other wall.

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:11.480
There are things that could be done.

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:12.480
We'll see.

Someday, someday.

02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:14.480
All right.

02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:16.320
