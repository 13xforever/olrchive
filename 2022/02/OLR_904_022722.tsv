0	13200	The software publisher Laundry Landscape has been flowing for years.
13200	16800	God Galaxy, Epic Games Store, Battle.net, a few among the many.
16800	20640	The landscape is ebbing just a touch with Bethesda choosing to close up their direct
20640	23160	storefront shop and move their library back to Steam.
23160	26520	Consolidation in action, business in motion, time ticks on.
26520	27520	P.S.
27520	28520	Fuck war.
28520	29720	This is my standout story.
29720	33040	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about
33040	35960	this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where Every
35960	36960	Gamer Has a Voice
36960	48400	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
48400	50840	where Every Gamer Has a Voice.
50840	58840	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again for episode number 904 of our show.
58840	64120	For tonight, February the 27th of 2022.
64120	65820	My name is Rob Roberts.
65820	68960	Do not adjust your TV sets over here at Twitch.tv.
68960	73280	Yes, it looks different tonight because as we've been hyping up on the show for the last
73280	75120	few weeks, I've moved.
75120	80520	I'm in a brand new location and yeah, we just did a minor facelift on some things to accommodate
80520	81720	for that.
81720	88400	At the same bandwidth, same token, some things might be off that they were before.
88400	90720	I'm understanding my audio might be a little bit echoey.
90720	93000	I've got some things to kind of fix there.
93000	98040	This room is not quite set up completely the way I want it to for the future, but please
98040	100640	bear with us while we work through some of the kinks.
100640	105860	Literally was working on the show up until 15 minutes before we went live tonight.
105860	109960	So there probably will be some things that go wrong as we get used to broadcasting here
109960	115960	from studio number 8 for the show or as I've been calling it studio infinity because as
115960	119720	you know, it's in a virtual environment, so the space is limitless.
119720	120720	And joining me-
120720	121720	So it's not studio Sense8?
121720	122720	Yes.
122720	125080	Say hello, hello Dark Sakura as she is always here.
125080	127080	No, it is not studio Sense8.
127080	130080	That was canceled, unfortunately, by Netflix.
130080	131360	And it lives on through us.
131360	132360	Wait.
132360	133360	That's right.
133360	134360	That's right.
134360	137280	It does in a way, or at least it lives on in the Wachowski universe because I believe
137280	142520	a lot of those folks that were acting in that were in the Matrix movie, which I never did
142520	143520	see.
143520	144520	I was-
144520	145520	I need to see the new one.
146080	150560	And of course, we do tape live still as we do every week over at the Voice Geeks Network
150560	156320	twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby
156320	158000	Black Wolf show.
158000	162040	And it was nice to have both of our shows on this week because last week we were off
162040	163360	two weeks ago, Bobby was off.
163360	165440	So we were both here tonight.
165440	166720	And I see you all in chat.
166720	167720	Hello, hello.
167720	169880	Pod Culture saying Sense8 was great.
169880	170880	Had one of my faves in it.
170880	171880	I love Sense8 too.
171880	173140	It was a great show.
173140	174840	I didn't watch the movie.
175160	176840	I still have to get caught up on that.
176840	178440	I will at some point.
178440	180000	Also joining us as he does every week.
180000	181000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
181000	182000	Hello.
182000	183000	Hi, Loki.
183000	184000	How are you?
184000	185000	I'm fine.
185000	186000	Good.
186000	187000	Did you ever watch Sense8?
187000	188000	Were you a fan of that?
188000	189000	No.
189000	190000	I didn't watch it.
190000	191000	Oh, I actually never watched it either.
191000	192000	I'm just saying.
192000	193000	What?
193000	194000	What?
194000	195000	All right.
195000	196760	If they're already made, you should check it out.
196760	198240	I did at least watch like the first season.
198240	199840	I'm pretty sure I saw the second season too.
199840	201600	It's pretty good.
201600	206000	If you guys do notice like, oh my gosh, the audio is like way off or something, please
206000	210000	feel free to holler and chat and I'll do my best to fix it as we go live.
210000	212760	But this is very much a screw it.
212760	220000	We'll do it live tonight because yeah, again, I just got settled into this space not even
220000	224240	a week ago and like got everything set up for OLR just in the past few days.
224240	225680	And today I've been very busy.
225680	229640	It's not just been unpacking with this new place, but it's been trying to get the old
229640	232320	place settled and taken care of as well.
232320	236840	And we purged a lot of shit at the old place.
236840	239600	And yeah, so there's that as well.
239600	242880	So pop culture says you got to dial it in and that takes time.
242880	243880	Well, thank you.
243880	244880	Thank you for understanding.
244880	245880	Appreciate that.
245880	246880	That is for sure.
246880	248360	We'll try to figure out.
248360	249360	Yeah.
249360	250360	All the fun stuff going on.
250360	251360	I expect immediate perfection.
251360	252360	Do you?
252360	253360	No.
253360	254360	From us, no.
254360	255360	Yeah, I know.
255360	260520	It's, it's, it's going to always be a little, a little weird.
260520	263280	That's just a, that's just the way it is here at a OLR.
263280	264280	Yeah.
264280	267800	They're saying that I sound distant, which I wonder if I'm not coming through the webcam,
267800	270680	but I'm supposed to in fact be coming through this mic that's sitting here.
270680	274800	I wonder if somehow that didn't get screwed up at some point, which is certainly, it's
274800	277300	certainly possible.
277300	278300	That's for sure.
278300	279300	But we'll see.
279300	280300	Oh, we'll see.
280300	281300	It says mic default.
281300	285320	Maybe if I, maybe if I do that, don't put it as default, just make the
285320	286320	selection.
286320	289240	I wonder, that's trusting windows and you can never trust windows.
289240	290960	Did that change anything?
290960	291960	I just did.
291960	292960	Maybe.
292960	293960	Not really.
293960	294960	Oh, dammit.
294960	295960	I thought that might be it.
295960	296960	All right.
296960	297960	Well, that's something I'll have to take a look at a little bit later.
297960	298960	So sorry if I sound a little weird.
298960	302640	Uh, I am using, I would say the weird thing is I'm using the same mic, the wave three
302640	307000	that I use for streaming, or at least I'm supposed to be, which sounds really nice when
307000	308000	I'm streaming.
308000	309720	So, um, yeah, I don't know what's going on.
309720	313080	So, um, if worse comes to worse, I still have the old mixing board and mic and I can always
313080	314600	get that all set up again.
314600	316920	Um, and maybe that's just what I'll end up doing.
316920	317920	We'll see.
317920	321880	It's, it's a learning experience here in our new studio, but do y'all like my, do y'all
321880	325600	like my burger time machine that you see behind me here on Twitch?
325600	331520	I'm noticing there's a little bit of a space next to it as well, that a nice little something
331520	333920	something could fit over here.
333920	338040	But what I also don't have set up is I have a ton of amiibo figures and other little things
338040	341400	and trinkets that I want, um, that I want to be using.
341400	343800	And I want that to all be set up as well.
343800	348320	And uh, yeah, so there's also what you guys don't see just off frame.
348320	352840	There's a walk-in closet and I've actually thought about having the arcade machines in
352840	354060	the walk-in closet.
354060	356080	So it's actually like a little walk-in arcade.
356080	357800	Um, that might be kind of fun.
357800	358800	We'll see.
358800	359800	We'll see.
359800	360800	There's still a lot of things to decide.
360800	366280	Anyway, we're going to get into the news, uh, as we do here, let's get into our kickoff
366280	367280	topic tonight.
367280	372240	Uh, a very big, uh, direct that happened this morning, right?
372240	374240	Uh, Loki, maybe you want to start us off here.
374240	375240	Yes.
375240	377480	It's a Pokemon themed.
377480	378480	I don't know.
378480	379920	Was it a direct or was it just like some other thing?
379920	380920	I don't think it was a direct.
380920	384040	It was like, well, today is actually the anniversary of Pokemon.
384040	388680	So today is like the anniversary of the games releasing, uh, the original red and green,
388680	389920	uh, in Japan.
389920	392280	And so, uh, they usually try to do a little something today.
392280	395360	So it was like Pokemon, Pokemon day celebration, if you will.
395400	399360	Uh, Mike Deaf says it's Pokemon presents was the actual name of it.
399360	400360	Uh, yeah.
400360	401360	Pokemon presents?
401360	402360	Sign me up.
402360	403360	Pretty much.
403360	404360	Yeah.
404360	410280	So they had a big announcement, well, lots of announcements actually.
410280	415380	So kind of going down the list here, uh, the biggest one obviously is new mainline entry.
415380	422060	So Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which are coming to Nintendo switch later this year to which
422060	423820	those trailers look pretty cool.
423820	425180	It looks open world.
425180	428180	It looks like Pokemon ArcSIS.
428180	431740	Did we have the B team working on the art for ArcSIS because this looks a lot better
431740	432740	than that.
432740	440940	And if you compare contrast to the game that just came out and it's like, eh, all those
440940	445820	complaints that people were saying about the art style, yeah, kind of valid.
445820	449820	Um, so that's coming out and of course the three starters that they have for that as
449820	450820	well.
450820	454100	Um, which one looks kind of like Donald Duck.
454100	460700	And then, uh, we've got a, it looks like now I'm assuming that this, are they all of
460700	464920	the Alolan Pokemon, but apparently Pokemon goes getting Alolan Pokemon March 1st.
464920	471300	We've already had some Alolan Pokemon as part of different events, but, uh, apparently we're
471300	473580	going to be getting more of them or all of them.
473580	475060	I don't know.
475060	476620	So that's coming very soon.
476620	481540	Pokemon Go tends to run things or roll things out like slowly.
481540	486300	Um, so when they say Alolan Pokemon are coming to Pokemon Go, it'll probably be like the
486300	493940	starters and, uh, maybe some of the, like, really like S or not S tier, but like F tier
493940	498180	kind of Pokemon in that game, you know, the normal types in the first area, uh, that'll
498180	500200	come through, uh, probably won't be a lot.
500200	504980	And then they'll release more throughout the year if it goes by, by like, um, the, the,
504980	508300	uh, like gen five and six and all that did.
508300	509300	Yeah.
509780	516580	Uh, apparently the mobile Pokemon game, um, so I'm assuming they're talking about Pokemon
516580	517580	Go.
517580	522180	Maybe, um, they're saying the Pokemon Dex is expanded to include gen seven editions
522180	524140	from sun and moon.
524140	532700	Um, Pokemon masters, ex ads, victory road and Pokemon cafe remix.
532700	534740	It gets a delivery feature as well.
534740	537540	All these games, I have no idea what they are.
537540	539180	Um, what else?
539180	546220	Uh, Pokemon unite is getting a mayhem mode and let's see brilliant diamond and shining
546220	550460	Pearl are getting shaman.
550460	553200	And I think Arxis had some updates as well.
553200	556900	There's supposed to be a 1.1 version cats or K whatever.
556900	557900	I don't care.
557900	558900	Arxis it Arceus.
558900	560420	I don't know how you pronounce it.
560420	563340	I don't care because they cut corners on their art.
563340	567300	So I'm going to cut corners on the pronunciation.
567300	573180	You can use a code, I guess, to get some free balls in the game.
573180	578980	So our case, Arxis adventure, whatever, however you want to pronounce that, um, if you use
578980	585940	that by March 31st, you get some free pokey balls and they're getting an anime adaptation
585940	589380	of it as well.
589380	594900	And I saw there was like actual DLC or something, but maybe not, maybe it's a bit early for
594900	595900	that.
596500	600700	There's just that patch, which it wasn't clear to me what all is in the patch.
600700	603900	I think it sounds like they're doing, um, like from what I was picking up, like some
603900	608300	of those, um, the, the encounters in the wild where like a ton of them show up, which I
608300	609780	can't remember the name of in the moment.
609780	615180	Um, but there was a whole quest line that I think will show more of those, that more
615180	616280	of those will show up.
616280	619140	So it wasn't DLC, but it's more like, just like a patch basically.
619140	622240	That's going to put more content in the game, massive mass outbreaks.
622240	625780	That's what Mike Deaf says in the chat, uh, outbreaks of alpha Pokemon.
625780	629140	I don't remember that being in the main game and I caught that that was in the trailer.
629140	632100	So I was like, Oh, that was scary.
632100	633100	Yeah.
633100	639060	And then, um, Pokemon sleep, um, nothing like that.
639060	640820	Pokemon sleep forever.
640820	641820	Yeah.
641820	645980	Uh, Mike Deaf says you get multiple outbreaks now instead of one.
645980	646980	Oh, that's good.
646980	649220	Cause the outbreaks are a really good way to catch shinies.
649220	652940	I know that's like the preferred shiny hunting method at this point.
652940	657060	You kind of combine that with having a really complete pokey decks and I think the shiny
657060	661220	charm and you put all that together and it makes the shinies like a lot more obtainable
661220	662220	than they were before.
662220	663220	So yeah.
663220	668740	So yeah, basically what they've done with the new update is they're modeling the outbreaks
668740	672300	of Pokemon based on COVID-19 outbreaks.
672300	676860	And so you'll see a lot more, a lot, a lot more Pokemon now because of that.
676860	677860	I see.
677860	678860	I see.
678860	679860	And it'll fade pretty quick, hopefully.
679860	680860	Yes.
680860	681860	It'll fade pretty quick.
681860	685100	It'll come out and everybody will forget our arcades didn't exist.
685100	691420	For a little while you'll lose your taste and play like bad Pokemon games.
691420	694900	You'll lose your taste for Pokemon and go play Elden Ring for a little while, which
694900	697460	is what it seems like everybody is doing this week.
697460	699080	I have zero interest in that game.
699080	702100	Everybody fucking dropped what they were doing to go play Elden Ring.
702100	703100	Yeah.
703100	704100	Here's the thing.
704100	705400	I'm not super big on Souls games.
705400	707460	I'm not big on George R.R. Martin.
707460	709440	I'm not here to yuck somebody's yum.
709440	712480	My husband loves those soul games, so I'm excited for him.
712480	714440	I've watched people streaming the game.
714440	715440	I get it.
715440	718800	It's just one of those things where I'm like, I just, I got other stuff I need to play right
718800	719800	now.
719800	724480	I won't piss in y'all's cornflakes, but I'll go eat some Froot Loops.
724480	726320	That that part.
726320	727320	Exactly that.
727320	728320	All right.
728320	729320	So, yeah.
729320	733520	So that was a nice little, again, Gen 9.
733520	736740	I was not expecting that whatsoever for that to come out.
736740	737740	And this year.
738140	741260	I thought like this would have been the Pokemon game of the year and that'd be it.
741260	745420	I would, especially with everything else on the Switch, having getting been pushed back,
745420	750260	I am shocked really that we are getting a new mainline Pokemon game this year.
750260	751260	That is for sure.
751260	753060	So, yeah, that is cool.
753060	756300	I'm really excited to play that at some point.
756300	757300	So let's see.
757300	759700	Dartisia in chat says, oh, my wife got Elden Ring.
759700	760740	I think she's digging it.
760740	764340	I might try it, although I'm knee deep in my second Cyberpunk playthrough.
764340	765580	Let's see.
765580	770500	Fifth Dream says, I've been watching an Australian lady catch all the shinies, then all the alpha
770500	771500	shinies.
771500	772500	Oh, my God.
772500	774620	That sounds like a nightmare to do that, too.
774620	775620	She's amazing.
775620	776620	Awesome.
776620	778580	Hey, that's like Elden Ring.
778580	783340	I watch people play it and it's fun, but I just don't think the you died, you died, you
783340	784740	died, you died is for me.
784740	785740	I've tried it.
785740	787060	I tried to play the original Demon's Souls.
787060	790460	I tried to play Dark Souls, I think, or one of the other ones.
790460	792820	I tried to play Bloodborne.
792820	794340	I just wasn't feeling it.
794340	795340	Sorry.
795340	799740	Mike Deft in chat says, the new games may be based on Spain or at least in the Mediterranean
799740	800740	Sea area.
800740	805100	Yeah, they haven't said for sure, but the name of one of the Pokémon to me kind of
805100	809780	sounded like, oh, I wonder if that isn't like influenced, like with Spain or something was
809780	810820	kind of interesting.
810820	813420	Which did you guys see the new starter type Pokémon?
813420	815940	I was curious what you guys thought of that.
815940	817500	I didn't bother.
817500	818900	Oh, look them up.
818900	822300	I like the Weed Cat.
822940	827260	There's Weed Kitty, there's Applegator and there's Emoduck.
827260	829740	Emod.
829740	831860	That's what I'm calling him anyway.
831860	836020	Mike Deft says, Springatito and Fuecoco.
836020	841140	Now see, that sounds like what Dark Sakura might actually name a pet, except it would
841140	843940	be FuegoGo, not Fuecoco.
843940	845940	But it's really close.
845940	851140	DJ RomaeF says, it's Kingdom Hearts Donald, not Emoduck.
851140	852420	I think they're all cute.
852420	857500	Like I don't, I have to see what they evolve into, but we'll see.
857500	861860	I don't know if these names sound more, yeah, they definitely do sound Italian, like not
861860	870220	so much Castilian, but more Italian because like Fuecoco, you know, like, I don't know,
870220	874820	that would think that would be more Fiore, Fue would be like related to Spanish, I would
874820	875820	think.
875820	886140	But the, I'm missing the other T in Springatito and I'm wanting to say Springatitio, you know,
886140	893140	so maybe, yeah, I guess they are a little bit more of the Castilian variety.
893140	899220	We're getting a little lesson from Mike Deft in chat, who I know is fluent in Spanish,
899220	905740	saying Gatitio equals little cat in Spanish and Coco equals Coco Drilo, which is also
905740	906740	Spanish.
906740	907740	Interesting.
907740	909240	So, well, we'll see.
909240	917220	My heart hurts that the cat is a grass type and that the fire type looks so freaking ridiculous.
917220	918220	Like I hate it.
918220	920860	I like that he's a cute little alligator.
920860	926300	I might just move on and play, you know, Dewey Duck.
926300	928440	I think a lot of people are going to play Dewey Duck.
928440	929440	That's for sure.
929440	930440	I don't know.
930440	936060	This might be the first time I start with a grass type if I play it because I'll be
936060	940820	honest, the last Pokemon game, I got halfway through it and I was like, this is why I don't
940820	941820	play Pokemon.
941820	947160	That was me with every single Pokemon game until Sword and Shield, which I absolutely
947160	948860	loved and beat.
948860	954780	So I did exactly the same with Sword and Shield as I do with every other Pokemon game.
954780	955780	Exactly the same.
956260	957780	I made it a little bit further in that one.
957780	962860	I actually got like to the fifth gym and then I was like, oh, I'm bored now.
962860	964860	It's just repetitive.
964860	965980	Yeah, I get it.
965980	972240	For me, it's like, oh my God, I feel the need that I have to collect everything in one area.
972240	974620	And that can be very overwhelming.
974620	979580	But with Sword and Shield's very open area, it was, I don't know, it felt a little less
979580	980780	like daunting.
980780	984400	And now that this game is going to be all open area, it sounds like kind of like Arceus
984400	985400	a little bit.
985400	987120	It's just still separated into five areas.
987120	988120	Let's be real.
988120	990920	But I'm into it.
990920	992360	I'm really open minded about it.
992360	993360	That's for sure.
993360	994360	Let's see.
994360	998880	Okay, before we get into our gaming weeks, as we usually do towards the top of the show,
998880	1001320	I think we have to say something.
1001320	1005840	I know we play video games to escape some of the dramas of the real world, but I think
1005840	1009920	we really have to acknowledge what's going on with Putin's invasion of Ukraine right
1009920	1014840	now, which is obviously an extraordinarily shitty situation.
1015680	1020320	I know a lot of people are saying it's Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is technically
1020320	1021320	accurate.
1021320	1023880	But I know there's a lot of Russian people that aren't happy about it either.
1023880	1029480	So I'm calling it Putin's one crazed madman's unnecessary invasion of a country.
1029480	1034120	And obviously, my heart goes out to, I don't know if we have listeners in Ukraine or that
1034120	1039520	area, but my heart goes out to the folks there and I hope everybody is safe throughout all
1039520	1040520	that.
1040560	1045920	There's an artist though that I follow in Russia, who I'm on Patreon.
1045920	1052040	He does NSFW stuff, but his art is beautiful, named Dima.
1052040	1057780	And he sent out a letter to all his patrons talking about how he's expecting like a full
1057780	1059640	internet lockdown.
1059640	1063760	And I mean, this is, you know, his livelihood.
1063760	1067360	And it's really, really depressing.
1067360	1072800	There's a lot of people in Russia who are negatively affected by this and completely
1072800	1076640	don't support the action whatsoever.
1076640	1081640	They're dealing with their you-know-who, you know?
1081640	1082640	Yep.
1082640	1083640	Yep.
1083640	1086440	And I've heard, unfortunately, some stuff on Facebook.
1086440	1089840	So I always take it with a grain of salt, but that we have a very large Russian population
1089840	1091320	here in the Sacramento area.
1091320	1095120	And unfortunately, I'm already hearing about people are bashing local businesses and stuff
1095280	1100020	when it's like, that makes no sense whatsoever because most people came over here to get
1100020	1101640	away from Putin and all that.
1101640	1107320	I mean, and then on top of the fact that again, not everybody in Russia is supporting what
1107320	1108320	Putin's doing.
1108320	1111440	So don't be stupid about it.
1111440	1112440	Yeah.
1112440	1118920	So let's just hope that a peaceful resolution can be found quickly.
1118920	1124840	And Putin obviously needs to lose a lot of the access that he has now.
1124840	1129200	I'm digressing a little bit, but this does have to do with video games, absolutely, because
1129200	1134320	a lot of your video games are being developed in Ukraine and the region and of course, streamers
1134320	1137400	and fans, of course, lots in Ukraine.
1137400	1143060	I was going to mention there's a very well-known Final Fantasy XIV streamer that was an American,
1143060	1146440	I believe, living in Ukraine, going to school or something like that.
1146440	1150680	And she's been given updates and I think she's in Poland right now as a lot of people have
1150680	1151940	gone over there and so forth.
1151940	1160860	So there's just a whole big fucking country getting attacked.
1160860	1163020	It's mind blowing when you're on the other side of the world.
1163020	1166060	You can't fathom what's going on.
1166060	1170580	But you're definitely hearing from people that are over there and gaming companies that
1170580	1174940	are over there and how they are reacting.
1174940	1181100	So we have GSE Game World, who is the studio that's behind the Stalker series or S-T-A-L-K-E-R.
1181100	1189620	They wrote a tweet that is asking folks to share their post with special aid information.
1189620	1194420	4A Games, who makes the Metro games, also shared a statement.
1194420	1198620	Frogwares said in their Twitter, we can't just stand by.
1198620	1201900	Russia attacks our homeland and denies the sovereignty of Ukraine.
1201900	1203840	We are trying to stay safe, but this is war.
1203840	1205140	There's no two ways about it.
1205140	1209380	We call on everyone to force Putin to withdraw from our lands.
1209420	1215220	Esports organizations, Navi is based out of Ukraine and shared a donation link.
1215220	1221060	Publishers, Crativo, TinyBuild, trying to help their employees that are based out of Ukraine.
1221060	1223340	I mean, this goes on and on and on.
1223340	1226900	I'm sure you've seen an awful lot on social media about it.
1226900	1232100	It definitely seems like, I don't know how y'all feel, but I definitely feel almost helpless
1232100	1235500	sometimes watching this stuff unfold on TV.
1235500	1240740	Obviously, there are humanitarian organizations that if you are able to, would happily be
1240740	1244540	able to accept donations and money and things like that, and there's no shortage of suggestions
1244540	1248180	out there online.
1248180	1254720	Spreading awareness is actually very important because there's disinformation campaigns going
1254720	1259380	on within Russia about what is actually happening.
1259380	1262540	Where have I heard of disinformation campaigns being a thing before?
1262580	1266340	Anyway, I don't want to get off the mark too much, but we know that disinformation goes
1266340	1270460	on out there, so sharing information is very important as well.
1270460	1275100	Mike Deaf points out, this war of mine is donating all their profits to help out Ukraine.
1275100	1276100	Yes, I saw that.
1276100	1277100	The devs of that game.
1277100	1278860	The game is called This War of Mine.
1278860	1282860	That is 11-bit studios that made that game, that is doing that as well.
1282860	1287760	Obviously, the games industry is absolutely impacted by this because the entire world
1287760	1288900	is impacted by this.
1288900	1295500	I think this is why many of us really pray for, or whatever it is you do, for a quick
1295500	1298620	resolution to this whole situation.
1298620	1302660	Anything that any of my co-hosts wanted to add on that before we get to our gaming weeks?
1302660	1304940	No, I didn't really have anything.
1304940	1305940	He could stop.
1305940	1306940	That's the thing.
1306940	1308940	He could stop.
1308940	1309940	Anytime.
1309940	1313940	Supposedly, they are going to do some talks in Belarus.
1313940	1318460	I'm trying not to get too optimistic, but what else can I do?
1318460	1320620	But try to have hope.
1320620	1335620	I saw that people are wondering why Ukraine isn't trying to go for other methods, reach
1335620	1340260	out, but there was a sign that I saw that summed that up perfectly that Russia could
1340260	1342700	stop anytime and the war would be over.
1342700	1346940	If Ukraine stops, there's no more Ukraine.
1346940	1349660	That's an excellent point.
1349660	1356580	There's already pictures of bodies.
1356580	1358020	They may be triggering for some people.
1358020	1361620	I don't want to shy away from the fact.
1361620	1365240	That's fine if you can't look at it, but someone does need to see it and drive home.
1365240	1372500	It's one thing when you hear it on TV or see it on Twitter or something, or us talking
1372500	1373620	about it.
1373620	1377980	It's another thing when you let it become real for you.
1377980	1380980	On that note, though, and I think this is very important because we've seen where video
1380980	1386180	games again come into play here, be very careful of misinformation and trusted video sources
1386180	1391340	because we've seen on Twitter where old video game footage from war-based games is being
1391340	1396380	circulated and labeled actual footage from what's going on and people are really quick
1396380	1398220	to retweet that shit.
1398220	1400260	You've got to be very careful.
1400260	1406940	I think we all have a responsibility when we click that Retreat button or just question
1406940	1408020	the source.
1408020	1414620	If the source is coming from a news account you've never heard of, question that.
1414620	1416620	You've just got to be careful.
1416620	1423860	Again, for news sources that you do recognize, check them on the bias map.
1423860	1427740	You want to stay center of the road as much as possible.
1427740	1432100	If you do read something that's slanted one direction, make sure you read something that
1432100	1434180	is equally slanted the opposite direction.
1434180	1436140	Have a well-rounded view of it.
1436140	1437500	The truth will be somewhere in the middle.
1437500	1438500	J.B.
1438500	1442300	WOGAN There's a point that none of the fake videos use Command & Conquer Red Alert.
1442300	1444820	I mean, really, that's just a missed opportunity in my opinion.
1444820	1445820	A.P.
1445820	1446820	Not going to go there.
1446820	1447820	All right.
1447820	1448820	Moving on.
1448820	1451580	Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have been
1451580	1454140	playing this week and how was your gaming week.
1454140	1455940	How have you been taking your mind off of?
1455940	1461020	I mean, you think like just when COVID, I don't want to say COVID is going away because
1461020	1462900	we all know COVID is never going away.
1462900	1463900	But just when it seems like-
1463900	1464900	J.B.
1464900	1465900	WOGAN Oh, we're going into summer.
1465900	1466900	It's going to get bad.
1466900	1467900	A.P.
1467900	1471060	COVID is in a dip, we'll say.
1471060	1474580	Just when you think like COVID is in a dip and it's safe to do certain things, now this
1474580	1475580	happens.
1475580	1478540	And it's just like, can't we have a normal fucking summer ever again?
1478540	1479540	J.B.
1479540	1480540	WOGAN We're going to need a bigger boat.
1480540	1481540	A.P.
1481540	1482540	At least we have video games.
1482540	1483540	So how was your gaming week?
1483540	1484540	Dark Soccer.
1484540	1485540	I'll start with you as I always do.
1486140	1487140	J.B.
1487140	1492380	WOGAN Well, I pretty much my Saturday and Wednesday post work streams have been dedicated
1492380	1495260	to the Legend of Zelda and Link to the Past.
1495260	1498580	I am cheating because I can.
1498580	1500780	I'm not playing the game for a challenge.
1500780	1503340	I'm playing the game because I fucking love the game and I love playing it and I love
1503340	1505220	going around and finding shit.
1505220	1513740	You know, I once again, true to form, did the palaces out of order because I always
1513740	1519220	do blind the thief before I do the forest palace.
1519220	1520500	And I don't even know why.
1520500	1521860	I've always done it that way.
1521860	1523900	And I keep thinking, oh, I'll do it the right way.
1523900	1525640	Well, isn't blind first?
1525640	1526640	Don't I do that one first?
1526640	1527640	No.
1527640	1529220	So I just said, screw it.
1529220	1530660	I can do them out of order if I want to.
1530660	1531660	I'm an adult.
1531660	1535620	So, um, but I finished, um, palace six.
1535620	1543040	I now have all of the items except what I need from, uh, seven and eight, which I get
1543040	1551300	the one of the staves, I think either in seven or eight and then the mirror shield.
1551300	1554980	Um, and I get the red mail from somewhere as well.
1554980	1561780	I got, I got the, the one stave last night, uh, staff staves, you know what I mean?
1561780	1565420	Um, at any rate, um, I've really, I've really been enjoying that and I'm trying
1565420	1566820	to decide what I want to do next.
1566820	1572860	I might do terror enigma or I might do playing, you know, shooter of Saturn games and being
1572860	1574220	bad at it.
1574220	1578580	Like the original gun bird or radiant silver gun, or I might actually play grandia.
1578580	1584040	I have a translated Saturn version of it and I'm actually kind of considering playing grandia.
1584040	1585040	So we'll see.
1585040	1586260	Maybe I'll make a poll.
1586260	1591820	I definitely moving on the soul blazer trilogy with a terror enigma.
1591820	1595260	I well, I played such a good underrated series.
1595300	1598540	And the one I haven't really played a whole lot of is terror enigma.
1598540	1600660	So that's kind of why I'm thinking about that.
1600660	1603780	I'm also considering Seiken Densetsu three, so we'll see.
1603780	1608100	I've got so many, you know, things up, up, you know, on my list and everything.
1608100	1610380	I might even just play like bad power Rangers games.
1610380	1611380	I don't know.
1611380	1612380	I'll figure it out.
1612380	1615020	But, um, I'm also of course playing dead by daylight.
1615020	1620180	I've been hanging out with Debbie a little bit less because, uh, she's a bitch.
1620180	1625820	Um, I have accidentally adopted nemesis.
1625820	1631540	Like oops, I, I adopted, um, so that's another one off of my list cause I hate playing nemesis.
1631540	1632540	I did a chat.
1632540	1637100	It's like the challenge that they give you like right when you start off the game.
1637100	1640800	I forgot what they call those challenges, like the dailies.
1640800	1643460	And it was to sacrifice two people.
1643460	1649500	I didn't remember that I still had my adapt build on so, and I expected to totally like
1649500	1656020	kill nobody because I suck at nemesis, but I got a four K and I thanked the people I
1656020	1657020	played against.
1657020	1663300	Uh, you know, I, I, okay, so I have to take a little tangent, little tangent.
1663300	1670820	I have been doing this thing now where instead of being bitchy or trolly in postgame chat,
1670820	1677500	I'm actually being really nice, really nice, like, Hey, I'm a little bit off my game.
1677500	1678500	Congrats.
1678500	1680300	Hope you have a great night.
1680300	1683300	And if people are really cool, then I will give them my favorite blessing.
1683300	1688380	May you jump in the hatch in front of a camping basement, Bubba.
1688380	1695100	Um, and for the most part, people who have started off being like really rude and trolly
1695100	1700220	actually apologize and turn around because I have made them feel like shit because that's,
1700220	1702660	that's what's reverse trolling, reverse trolling.
1702660	1706420	Or there's people who are genuinely nice and you know, and I typically mean it when I say
1706420	1709220	have a good evening and are like, Oh, well you too.
1709220	1714620	And that's my little piece to combat toxicity in the game.
1714620	1718440	And so far it actually makes my games feel like they're more fun when I'm done.
1718440	1723540	If I put a little positive spin at the end, I mean, the one thing I'll do is like, Oh,
1723540	1727180	all of you are great except for the loser that disconnected.
1727180	1728260	And then I report them.
1728260	1730380	So that's the one thing I'm trying to do.
1730380	1737740	I'm trying to make my little corner of gaming slightly more delightful instead of toxic
1737740	1738740	sludge.
1738740	1739740	I like that.
1739740	1740740	Yeah.
1740740	1746460	Um, I am also of course still playing Fantasian, but now I am like way too low level to do
1746460	1748740	damn near anything.
1748740	1754140	Like I got my ass handed to me on a battle that it said I was at the right level for.
1754140	1763220	So I might actually do more of Fantasian offline just to, uh, just to grind a little bit and
1763220	1770260	uh, go back to, go back to it when I'm not feeling as, uh, pained by it.
1770260	1777380	So, um, and you know, other than that, it's just been, you know, we had some pinball stuff
1777380	1778380	going on.
1778380	1783180	We're making some hard decisions about which ones we're going to sell to afford the big
1783180	1784180	one.
1784180	1790220	Um, they disassembled creature from the black lagoon in the living room yesterday while
1790220	1791220	I was working.
1791220	1793260	And that was really intensely annoying.
1793260	1794260	Oh, wow.
1794260	1799020	But other than that, been, been pretty, been pretty okay.
1799020	1800020	Been pretty okay.
1800020	1806180	So yeah, just those are, those are my, oh, and wordscapes, but it doesn't count.
1806180	1807180	All right, Loki, we'll go to you.
1807180	1809560	How was your gaming week?
1809560	1818240	It was Minecraft, surprise, um, no, so I actually did play a bit of, um, nerdcraft is mostly
1818240	1822880	like kind of editing stuff, but I did a little bit of, uh, nerdcraft stuff.
1822880	1828680	I posted a video as a second part of a video I posted, uh, the previous to that, uh, cause
1828680	1829680	I had a lot of footage.
1829680	1832960	I had to split it up in two because it had been way too long otherwise.
1832960	1838360	And then I've been working on a mod pack for, uh, the one 19 snapshot that just came out.
1838360	1845320	So they have a brand new kind of, uh, experimental snapshot featuring the warden, which is kind
1845320	1851860	of the new like boss creature that's in the, will be in the upcoming Minecraft version.
1851860	1860000	And so I created a mod pack with, um, the data packs and stuff in there to spread this
1860000	1865320	block called skulk around the entire world, basically.
1865320	1870680	Um, with that skulk has this thing called a skulk sensor that detects vibrations.
1870680	1877840	And if you, um, do enough movement or hit things or whatever, it'll send off, it can
1877840	1882280	possibly send off this other block, which is called a skulk shrieker.
1882280	1888080	And if that goes off in the right scenario, then the warden spawns and it's basically
1888080	1889080	not easily killed.
1889080	1893480	I mean, you can kind of cheese it right now cause it's still work in progress, but it's,
1893480	1895120	you know, basically a tank.
1895120	1897200	You can't just like fight it hand to hand.
1897200	1899840	You have to kind of cheese it if you want to win.
1899840	1903960	So I'm building a whole Minecraft hardcore series around that where it's just spawning
1903960	1904960	everywhere.
1904960	1909160	Cause I see all these videos of people like going into the new biome in the game called
1909160	1912960	the deep dark and they're like, Oh my God, once, you know, warden, this is so intense
1912960	1913960	and stuff.
1913960	1915960	I'm like, you haven't seen anything yet.
1915960	1918880	So, um, that's what I'm working on.
1918880	1919880	So I have a new series.
1919880	1925040	I put out a little teaser trailer for it called the deep dark world, and then I just
1925040	1926760	needed to start filming it.
1926760	1931080	I did kind of a live stream last Sunday, a similar concept I added.
1931080	1932640	I finally got shares working.
1932640	1938120	So that's why I'm also restarting the series and the seed was on before was kind of boring.
1938120	1943760	So I'm going to try to get a better seed to play in and then, um, yeah.
1943760	1949860	And so we'll film that and then kind of want to edit, you know, uh, very, uh, cinematically.
1949860	1954660	So I'll do that the side from all that, uh, gaming wise, I got a new computer.
1954660	1959600	Um, it's not hooked up yet because it's slightly broken at the moment.
1959600	1964760	So it, it's, it's no fault of the person that sent it to me.
1964760	1968760	It's something came loose or something happened in shipping.
1968760	1976180	And so my radiator on it, the fans don't spin, they, they light up, but they don't spin,
1976180	1983220	which tells me that the, uh, PC fan, uh, cable or whatever, whatever's controlling
1983220	1986460	the speed of the fans is not hooked up or something.
1986460	1988860	Although I can't see anything that's disconnected.
1988860	1993340	So, um, I don't know, I'm going to probably have to take it to a shop to have them look
1993340	1994340	at it.
1994340	1996500	Cause I just, I just don't want to mess with it.
1996500	1998420	Um, but it's very nice.
1998420	2004900	It's um, it's an I nine, I think 10, 900, uh, KF or something like that.
2004940	2006940	Um, I think that's what it was maybe 10, 700.
2006940	2012380	I don't remember, but it's, you know, 10 cores, 20 threads, uh, fast three, seven up to I
2012380	2019660	think five, four, um, gigahertz as 32 gigs of Ram, six terabyte hard drives.
2019660	2025960	Um, it's a got a 30, 80 TI in it and a dedicated capture card.
2025960	2028100	So it's like perfect for streaming.
2028100	2031140	Um, so that's kind of what I wanted it for.
2031140	2036740	Um, also cause my stupid laptop is so loud that I have to literally edit my voice.
2036740	2042300	I have to record my voice separate and then I have to edit out these loud fan from it.
2042300	2045580	Although now that I look at it, you know, I've, this thing has like so many fans on
2045580	2046580	it.
2046580	2053160	It may be louder, but, and I had to have it on my desk cause, uh, you know, the cables
2053160	2054160	won't reach otherwise.
2054160	2057460	Um, it will be a mess.
2057460	2065260	So hopefully it's not louder, but I'm looking forward to playing around the 30, 80 TI cause
2065260	2066260	it's going to be pretty good.
2066260	2068160	I mean, this is not bad right now.
2068160	2072500	It's got a 20, 70 in it, but you know, it'd be nice not to have a laptop anymore.
2072500	2077340	Um, cause I've been playing on like gaming laptops for a while and um, it's just nice
2077340	2078940	to have like a dedicated desktops.
2078940	2080980	I don't really take my computer anywhere anymore.
2080980	2085580	I used to like take it all over the place and it liked to the show and stuff, but, um,
2085580	2087420	you know, it'll be nice to kind of have that.
2087420	2090900	Plus we'll still have my laptop if I need to, you know, do stuff with it.
2090900	2091900	All right.
2091900	2096540	Um, let's see, my gaming week, uh, my gaming week was pretty unexciting because of the
2096540	2097660	move and everything.
2097660	2101380	So there's very little I've been playing, uh, like, like dark Sakura has her word scapes.
2101380	2102660	I've been playing word hole.
2102660	2105140	Uh, but now, now it's not just wordle.
2105140	2108980	I really enjoy cordle, the one that's four of them at once.
2108980	2115540	And then the one that's really awesome as is seto wordle or it's 16, 16 wordles, all
2115540	2119300	at once in 21 guesses, uh, that one is a lot of fun.
2119300	2122180	So I've, I've still found, found time for things like that.
2122180	2125740	Uh, but otherwise, as far as like playing like actual games, like my consoles aren't
2125740	2126740	even hooked up right now.
2126740	2128940	Um, that's something I've got to take care of in the coming days.
2128940	2131220	I had to get some new HDMI cables.
2131220	2135100	I really want to get on the new expedition for no man's sky.
2135100	2138020	So when I do get set up, I'm hoping I can do some streaming.
2138020	2142300	The nice thing about this new space, Alan and I have separate spaces.
2142300	2145900	We can stream together and our internet, now that we have fiber internet, we don't
2145900	2146900	have cable.
2146900	2147900	We have fiber now.
2147900	2151220	So our, our upload is as fast as our downloads.
2151220	2155460	So that is, that is why also dark soccer and Loki can actually see the show.
2155460	2157980	I don't know if you guys know for the past, you know, however long we've been doing the
2157980	2161160	show virtually, they could never see me during the show.
2161160	2165620	You guys could be, but they couldn't, but now I'm uploading so much.
2165620	2170100	Uh, they can see me, you can see me and, uh, Alan could probably be streaming right now
2170100	2172020	as well and it wouldn't affect anything.
2172060	2173460	So that'll be really fun.
2173460	2176660	So I'm hoping we can get into that and maybe some, uh, dead by daylight and who knows what,
2176660	2181500	but honestly, I've been playing a little dead by daylight, uh, and Final Fantasy 14, just
2181500	2184380	because they're on my PC, easy decompression games.
2184380	2186180	Um, but I haven't been playing a lot.
2186180	2191400	I would say my big dead by daylight achievement, I got Felix to level 50 and I'm probably going
2191400	2192660	to prestige him.
2192660	2195860	Um, and that's because he still doesn't have borrowed time.
2195860	2197900	So I'll probably just prestige him.
2197900	2200780	Um, and that does remind me.
2200780	2204140	Yeah, I should have pig P three 50 this week.
2204220	2204620	Oh, nice.
2204620	2205060	Congrats.
2205580	2207660	Um, I, there is one game.
2207700	2207940	Okay.
2207940	2208820	So here's the nice thing.
2208820	2211500	Now that I have the fiber internet, that's unlimited.
2212140	2216540	I went through and patched all these fucking games that I've been waiting on for so long.
2216540	2220540	And even Alan reminded me last night, you could download flight simulator again.
2220540	2222900	And I was like, I could, you're right.
2222900	2227380	I haven't done that yet, but one of the games that I patched, I've been waiting on for forever
2227380	2231180	is DJ max technica on a PC, the steam version.
2231340	2233500	And I actually played a little bit of that.
2233500	2237300	I don't, when did they start doing season content and that game?
2237300	2240420	Cause I've missed that and they're up to like season four.
2240420	2240940	Whoops.
2241300	2242660	Uh, so I was playing a little bit of that.
2242740	2243700	I had to play flea.
2243700	2244620	It's my favorite song.
2244700	2247300	And then I was checking out some other songs that they've added in that as well.
2247300	2252020	So I guess there was a little bit of that, that might add a surprise in a good way.
2252020	2256100	Some of our music game fans is that I was getting back into DJ max technica this week.
2256140	2258340	Thanks to, uh, getting everything patched.
2258820	2259220	All right.
2259540	2261180	Um, that's it for our gaming week.
2261220	2265220	Let's get into some more news again, if you're just joining us tonight.
2265500	2267860	Uh, this is the first show in a new space.
2268060	2271940	Some things may be a little bit off and echoey while we try to get things worked out.
2271940	2276380	So sorry about that, but we wanted to do a show, which is better than no show.
2276700	2279540	Uh, let's get to some big headlines this week.
2279540	2279940	Loki.
2280780	2281220	Yes.
2281220	2285220	Capcom had teased with a countdown and then an announcement.
2285220	2291700	Um, street fighter six is coming out with ultra wide, uh, Ryu.
2293140	2299940	He is like super ultra wide and his very defined Dick in the trailer.
2300340	2303940	Or at least that's what some people are seeing in that trailer.
2304740	2308220	I'm just saying, you know, he was my first video game crush.
2308460	2308780	Oh yeah.
2308780	2310220	He's still my video game crush.
2310220	2310740	Come on.
2312780	2315020	No, I, I think, I think it's just a fold.
2315020	2319300	And the clothes, but you know how some people will, it's what do they call it?
2319300	2321180	The Roshashark test, the ink blots.
2321260	2325740	Some people will see different things and some people are seeing some things in Ryu's
2325740	2326260	pants.
2326300	2327340	So there is that.
2327860	2331060	Um, but yeah, the, the trailer was, it's short.
2331100	2333420	It didn't show any gameplay whatsoever.
2333420	2333780	So it wasn't,
2333780	2335060	I don't know who the other character is.
2335060	2337460	I don't know if it's a new character or some other character, but
2337500	2338820	I think his name is Lucas.
2338820	2342220	He was the last street fighter five DLC character.
2342220	2347540	And I'm assuming it is what was all intended to be a tie into six all along.
2348020	2349820	So, um, I think that's what that is.
2350140	2350740	Yeah.
2351020	2351300	Okay.
2351620	2355580	Um, the more exciting thing I think is actually the Capcom fighting collection,
2355700	2358740	which has a bunch of different games in there, uh, including dark
2358740	2362180	stockers, the night warriors, night warriors, dark stockers, revenge, vampire
2362180	2368180	hunter to dark stockers, revenge, vampire savior, vampire savior to red earth, super
2368220	2373100	gem fighter, mini mix cyber bots, full metal madness, super puzzle fighter to
2373100	2376780	turbo and hyper street fighter to the anniversary edition.
2376980	2378220	There's not as many red earth.
2378300	2378580	I know.
2378580	2382420	I was going to say, you said a bunch of games and red earth, red earth.
2383500	2383740	Yeah.
2383740	2386340	There's not a lot of street fighter in there because they just did a street
2386340	2387100	fighter collection.
2387100	2388180	So it makes sense.
2388220	2391700	Um, but yeah, dark Sakura.
2391780	2394940	Uh, I don't know if you've done red earth as a classic game of the week, but let's,
2394940	2395820	let's talk about that.
2396660	2398540	Why are you so excited about this?
2399100	2400700	It never got any sort of home port.
2402580	2404260	Here anyway, did it, did it?
2404540	2406500	No, I guess it never came out in Japan either.
2406500	2406940	Wow.
2407460	2412180	No, it's they, you, I mean, the, the two times I've played, it was once in an
2412180	2415580	arcade game and another one on somebody's a CPS converter.
2416100	2416540	Wow.
2416860	2418980	And it had, it had another name in Japan, right?
2419380	2422780	It was, uh, I can't remember the name of it.
2422860	2423900	They call it somebody in chat.
2423900	2425460	No, I know what it was called.
2425460	2429180	It was, um, called, uh, uh, Warzard.
2429540	2430140	That's it.
2430140	2430660	Warzard.
2430660	2431100	Yeah.
2431460	2431860	Yeah.
2433060	2433420	Nice.
2433460	2440140	And on top of that, the red earth wasn't really that widespread here in the U S
2440180	2444940	and the only character that a lot of people knew from that game was, uh, um,
2445380	2447900	Tessa or Tabasa.
2449460	2453860	Uh, dark Tetsuya, uh, a well, our historian in the house saying red earth was the
2453860	2456340	classic game of the week, episode 829.
2456580	2458900	That's a little more recently than I would have thought that
2458900	2460380	was three years ago.
2461620	2462100	Nice.
2462580	2464340	But it's, it's a beautiful game.
2464340	2472020	I mean, of course it's got that sort of alpha, um, era artwork, but I mean, the
2472020	2478100	game came out in, in 96 and it's, it's still just as beautiful, but you know,
2478100	2481500	what's not as beautiful the new street fighter six logo.
2484060	2484620	It's beautiful.
2485060	2486020	I don't hate it.
2486220	2488260	I don't, I heard the clip art thing.
2488740	2492660	I think that's just a weird coincidence because it is a minimalist style.
2493220	2499060	I don't hate it, but it's like when you don't show a single frame of the game,
2499420	2501180	which is what Capcom chose to do.
2501180	2503340	And I understand a teaser is a teaser fine.
2504180	2507820	And all you give is the logo for people to dissect and make their
2507820	2511220	three hour YouTube's about, then this is exactly what you're going to get.
2511300	2511700	Right.
2511740	2513620	Is what's happening in this particular case.
2513620	2517860	So, you know, I don't hate the logo, but I want to see it emotion.
2517900	2521180	I want to see like, what is the, what does the UI look like?
2521220	2522940	You know, does it justify the logo?
2523620	2529740	So, um, going back to the Capcom fighting collection, we have a lot of people in
2529740	2534540	chat that of course are bringing up, uh, rival schools, uh, and the, or the
2534540	2539700	lack thereof in this collection, SSJ owner Matt says project justice or rival
2539700	2542460	school just can't get on these Capcom collections.
2542500	2542700	Yeah.
2542700	2543580	What's up with that?
2543580	2548620	Is it just one of those Capcom is saving it for a different collection or I mean,
2548660	2554140	I usually like to think they're just being assholes is not like really like an
2554140	2558660	explanation, although God damn when Nintendo's back catalog, it sure sometimes
2558660	2562900	feels like it, but I feel like there's gotta be a bit like, is there a rights
2562900	2563340	issue?
2563340	2565420	I don't know about like maybe the music.
2565460	2566540	I have no idea.
2566540	2567540	It's wild.
2568340	2571900	Isn't it like, because that's the 3d engine, whereas these are all 2d.
2571900	2574180	I mean, it's that have anything to do with it?
2574180	2574580	You think?
2575380	2578220	Possibly, but I feel like that hasn't stopped other games.
2578260	2581540	Don't they have like, I'm sure that they've got emulators at this point that
2581540	2583260	can handle rival schools.
2583260	2585180	They're like, I wouldn't be that hard.
2585340	2590140	Now DJRMS again, this is all just rumors and, you know, conclusion jumping.
2590140	2592540	I think it's a good way to put it, but it's a, it's a logical one.
2592940	2593980	It's plausible.
2593980	2599540	We'll say, uh, DJRMS says supposedly Capcom lost the license to rival schools.
2599860	2603140	I assume because the rival schools was done on the EX engine, which is
2603140	2608580	connected to Arika, I think so that could be in the characters.
2609220	2613180	Yeah, I guess so, but that could explain why the other game has never been just
2613180	2615100	like re-released to one of these collections.
2615580	2617980	So, uh, Zen Monkey 11 says, you know what?
2618020	2619540	They just ruined rival schools.
2619540	2621140	Let it stay the gem that it is.
2621540	2623020	I can see that perspective as well.
2623260	2625220	You'll never, you'll never top the original.
2625420	2625860	Who knows?
2626460	2629460	No, I, I, how did they, how did they ruin it?
2629460	2630660	Project Justice was great.
2632060	2637460	Well, but, but it's many, many years later now than the distance between those two.
2637500	2638420	So maybe, I don't know.
2638700	2638940	I don't know.
2639500	2642820	Uh, Mike Deff does say they didn't lose it because there's literally a rival
2642820	2645300	school's character in the last season past the Street Fighter 5.
2645500	2650060	So the characters, I think, yeah, the IP and all that, uh, is probably still good,
2650060	2653340	but we don't know so much about the actual game game.
2653660	2656660	Uh, as Joe and Hermat does point out, maybe it's connected to why we don't see
2656700	2659660	Street Fighter EX in any of these collections as well.
2660820	2661340	Who knows?
2661780	2665140	Uh, but more to come on Street Fighter 6 in the future, I'm sure.
2665140	2670580	Speaking of big games with a 6 in them, uh, many, many people happy about the
2670580	2674980	release of the Final Fantasy 6 pixel remaster this week, uh, and this is a
2674980	2678740	little bit different than the other five pixel remasters that they did because
2678980	2683340	they've actually put some of that, like two and a half D stuff in this game,
2683700	2685420	namely the opera scene.
2685660	2689860	So whereas Final Fantasy 6 pretty much looks like all the other pixel remasters
2689860	2694740	throughout the entire game, the opera scene they decided to make look a little,
2694780	2698740	they kicked it up a notch and that doesn't just include this new graphics,
2698980	2700980	but there's actual singing.
2701180	2706140	So they actually gave Celeste voice lines and they have an actress singing it.
2706580	2709820	Now, some people are critical that the voice actress doesn't really
2709820	2714780	sound like an opera singer, but a lot of people pointing out that would
2714780	2715820	actually be canon.
2716260	2718940	If you think about the story and the way that Celeste ends up in the
2718940	2721980	opera scene anyway, she's not supposed to be a professional opera singer.
2722380	2726580	Funny enough, in an interview with Nobuo Uematsu talking about all this,
2726780	2731700	Uematsu kind of confirms this, saying in a quote, the Draco opera song was
2731700	2735460	supposed to be sung by an opera singer, but Celeste would suddenly appear on
2735460	2736180	the stage.
2736500	2739660	If Celeste could actually sing real opera, that would be a lie.
2739860	2744380	So we had the fixation to intentionally choose someone whose vocals didn't seem
2744380	2747300	like an opera singer, but more like a musical singer.
2747300	2748580	So that is kind of interesting.
2748900	2751620	By the way, if you want, you can hear this now.
2751620	2755740	It's actually been dubbed or whatever in many different languages.
2756060	2761100	American English is one of them, but it also exists in Italian, German,
2761180	2766700	Spanish, Korean, I believe Japanese as well for sure would make sense.
2766740	2769660	And I think there was one other that's not in this list for some reason, but
2769660	2773900	still very cool that that all time classic scene exists in all those
2773900	2774780	different languages.
2774780	2778740	If you want something more authentic to opera, maybe watch it in Italian and
2778740	2779380	see what you think.
2779380	2780860	I'm sure it's all on YouTube by now.
2780860	2781540	That's for sure.
2781860	2785300	So a dark to see in chat says, yeah, the opera thing makes sense.
2785340	2789460	She's a general for the empire and the opera singer thing fell into her lap.
2789500	2789820	Yeah.
2789820	2795140	So, um, I'm very, I really, really want to play the six remaster.
2795300	2798340	The music, the soundtrack is fire.
2798380	2799860	Like it's really good.
2800180	2805220	Um, I'm also kind of being a stick in the mud because I want them to fucking
2805220	2806380	release this on console.
2806420	2809460	Like how hard is that to do to release this game on console?
2809900	2812780	Um, and I'm, I'm hoping they, I'm hoping they do.
2812860	2813540	That's for sure.
2814060	2815860	So we'll see what happens with that.
2816540	2822620	Um, on a related note, and I talked about this two weeks ago, cause you
2822620	2825620	might remember two weeks ago, we were talking about that Nintendo direct and
2825660	2827540	the surprise announcement of live alive.
2827980	2833980	And I said, you know, baby, baby, this is a test to see if chrono trigger
2833980	2835340	is going to happen in this engine.
2835780	2840500	We'll get this, a report from Fumitsu talking to the developers of triangle
2840500	2841300	strategy.
2841780	2847220	They confirmed on a square Enix radio show that president Yotsuka Matsuda once
2847220	2850220	super Nintendo games remade in that art style.
2852060	2855380	Well, well, what other super Nintendo games are left?
2855380	2858460	I suppose there's others, but I'm just, I like to be very tunnel visioned on
2858460	2863980	this in a quote, producer Tomoya Asano said, the president ordered us to make
2863980	2865820	more use of HD 2d.
2866060	2868980	So we decided to think about remakes of past titles.
2869340	2872860	So we lined up possible titles and thought about which could be done in HD
2872860	2874980	2d and brought them to the president.
2875620	2877580	The list in here's here.
2878540	2880060	Now wait for this.
2880300	2881780	This is the real exciting part.
2881780	2884620	So dark Sakura, you were just talking about Terra enigma, right?
2884660	2885460	Keep that in mind.
2886420	2894660	The list included titles released by square and Enix for the super Famicom
2895100	2899660	ones, which were suitable for HD 2d ones, which were unsuitable for it.
2899940	2902860	And ones which were a possible to play like mahjong games.
2902860	2903860	Fuck the mahjong games.
2904620	2905980	We know I want my shop.
2906580	2907940	Some people are into those.
2907980	2912700	They, they can have, they can go sit in a corner with the 5,000 other mahjong
2912700	2914020	titles that exist.
2914340	2919700	Give me fucking, how many of those mahjong titles are in HD 2d, not very
2919700	2920220	many.
2921460	2925780	We lined them all up and made a presentation that live alive was the most
2925780	2926340	suitable.
2926660	2932300	The second place was Actraiser and Actraiser has already been released on the
2932300	2937140	switch as Actraiser Renaissance, even if it didn't end up using the same style.
2938740	2940220	That is very interesting.
2940220	2946020	The fact, I, I, I didn't even consider two weeks ago, Enix titles could be in play
2946020	2946700	as well.
2946780	2949340	That is, that's exciting.
2949780	2950740	That's very exciting.
2952620	2955060	Some comments about the Fanta SE 6 remaster in chat.
2955060	2958980	5th Dream says the new veld theme, Wild West is so good.
2958980	2959620	Yes, it is.
2959620	2960060	I heard it.
2960060	2961020	It's very, very good.
2961460	2963220	Mike Deff says about the opera scene.
2963220	2965660	It's awesome that it translated for many languages.
2966100	2967540	Interested to check that out.
2967860	2970820	Dartitsuya in chat says Rob hates mahjong confirmed.
2971260	2977100	I spent hours and hours playing mahjong solitaire, which was released here as
2977100	2977900	Shanghai.
2978060	2980420	You might remember that from like the late 80s.
2980420	2982540	It was like a quintessential Mac game.
2982900	2988300	And I remember my uncle had a Mac for his business and he had Shanghai installed on
2988300	2990180	it, which is, it's just mahjong solitaire.
2990620	2992260	And I played the shit out of that game.
2992260	2996060	That's the one where you have the titles and you can only move them out to the side.
2996060	2997300	You can't move them up and down.
2997580	2998140	That's how it works.
2998140	3002460	So that's, yeah, that's, that should be a classic game sometime, sometime if it hasn't
3002460	3002860	already.
3002860	3003420	I don't know, maybe.
3003740	3007060	So yeah, Dartitsuya says, Oh yeah, I think I remember those tile matching games.
3007060	3008980	So I don't hate mahjong.
3009300	3011900	I just, we've, we've had that.
3011940	3013180	We don't need more.
3014540	3016020	And that's, that's my opinion.
3016060	3016980	I'm entitled to it.
3017700	3020140	All right, let's move on to our Sakura.
3022300	3026220	So I hope I'm not muted because I would be sad.
3026860	3027260	Okay.
3027900	3033780	So Nintendo actually did buy somebody as we teased before the show.
3034700	3044620	So Nintendo has actually acquired one of their partner companies, which is SRD company
3044620	3045100	limited.
3045540	3053420	They were a developer of about 140 employees that has worked exclusively on first party
3053420	3056220	Nintendo software for about 40 years.
3056700	3063940	They operate near Nintendo's Kyoto headquarters started in 1979 and worked on games as far
3063940	3068980	back as Donkey Kong and have been, had a hand in just about every major Nintendo franchise,
3068980	3071740	including the Mario games, Zelda games, animal crossing.
3072460	3076140	The last thing that they worked on was game builder garage, ring fit adventure, and one
3076140	3076820	two switch.
3077420	3086180	So the acquisition is expected to close on April 1st, assuming it gets approved.
3088300	3093140	Basically the switch is a level of success, allow them to invest in different business
3093140	3093940	opportunities.
3094420	3100700	That's including an $880 million expansion of the game development capability.
3101460	3108780	And their president, Futakara Shintaro said that it would spend up to a hundred billion
3108780	3113860	yen, which is about 880 million, expanding internal game development and up to 50 billion
3113860	3114100	yen.
3114100	3118740	That's about 440 million growing non-game entertainment software assets like movies.
3119260	3126140	So they've already started office construction to expand the Kyoto office and wanting to
3126140	3128500	create more games in-house than outsource.
3129140	3132180	So, yeah, pretty big news.
3132420	3137060	I mean, not a lot of people know of that company, but they know of what they've done.
3137220	3137540	Yeah.
3138620	3143060	And it's funny because, again, going back to two weeks ago when Activision was bought by
3143060	3149020	Microsoft, Bungie was bought by Sony, a lot of people were like, who's Nintendo going to
3149020	3149220	buy?
3149220	3149820	Konami?
3150060	3152460	And it was like, no, that's not how Nintendo works.
3152460	3158300	Nintendo buys companies that they, and exactly what those of us that actually pay
3158300	3162260	attention throughout the years have been saying is this is exactly what's happening.
3162580	3166580	Nintendo is effectively buying somebody that honest to God, I thought they already owned.
3167500	3169340	Especially when you talk about the games that they made.
3169620	3173580	How did they not already own the developers of Ring Fit Adventure and 1-2 Switch?
3174220	3177100	Honestly, I honestly thought Nintendo already owned them.
3177260	3179740	And that is very much who Nintendo buys.
3179820	3182700	Companies you thought were already a part of Nintendo.
3183500	3185260	And as to 100, Matt says, yeah, I agree.
3185260	3186580	I thought they already owned them.
3187420	3188380	Yeah, exactly.
3188380	3188660	Right.
3189300	3191780	So, but there you go.
3192020	3193220	Now you all can shut up.
3193220	3194380	Nintendo bought somebody.
3194540	3195940	So everybody bought somebody.
3196500	3198220	It's a new round.
3198220	3198900	Round two.
3200620	3202580	We'll see what happens in the next round of acquisitions.
3202860	3203220	Right.
3203420	3203780	All right.
3203780	3204660	Who's going to get EA?
3204660	3205220	Stay tuned.
3205540	3206020	All right.
3207060	3207780	Moving on.
3210100	3214860	I was going to say maybe Nintendo might have their eye on EA.
3215260	3215660	I'm kidding.
3217260	3217620	All right.
3217620	3217900	I know.
3218860	3222180	If your podcast is telling you that, I'm sorry, I shouldn't be shady.
3222220	3223420	I shouldn't be shady.
3223420	3225300	I think I'm just, I'm jaded having done this.
3225300	3226340	Just do it, Rob.
3226420	3226700	All right.
3226700	3229380	If your podcast is saying that Nintendo is going to buy EA.
3230820	3232820	Your podcast isn't paying attention to the gaming industry.
3232820	3233580	That's all I'm going to say.
3234580	3239940	Especially after EA left them at the fucking altar with the Wii U stuff.
3240740	3241700	Nintendo's not buying EA.
3242100	3242500	All right.
3243100	3243620	Moving on.
3244180	3247300	Let's get into S200, Matt says, drag them, Rob.
3247420	3247900	I will.
3247900	3248420	I will.
3249060	3251380	Perhaps in a new video game, Dark Soccer, we'll talk about later.
3252540	3256540	Meanwhile, some companies are buying, some companies are offloading, right, Loki?
3257460	3257940	Yes.
3257940	3263660	Well, some some companies are finally reversing course on the dumbest decisions
3263660	3269660	I've seen in the industry that is self-contained launchers for different
3269660	3270180	companies.
3270180	3275620	So Bethesda is getting rid of its launcher and it's going back to Steam.
3276060	3276820	So that's right.
3276820	3281820	You'll access all your games through Steam where it should be accessed and not
3281820	3283860	through Bethesda's stupid launcher.
3285980	3286660	I'm down.
3287500	3288220	I love that.
3289500	3293700	Yeah, I actually have the Bethesda launcher because you could grab free games
3293700	3296580	on there for a while, like Quake, the original Quake.
3296620	3298900	Oh, actually, I think they gave away the whole trilogy at some point.
3299660	3301540	So it'll be nice to just roll that into Steam.
3301980	3305460	Yeah, and it will be able to migrate to Steam as well.
3305500	3305860	Yeah.
3306700	3309660	So that is why I installed the Bethesda launcher.
3309660	3311380	You can't transfer things over yet.
3311500	3313220	That doesn't happen until I think April.
3313420	3315220	Yeah, April is when they're sunsetting that.
3315260	3318420	Yeah, when I read the news, I was like, oh, okay, let me move things over to
3318420	3318740	Steam.
3318740	3321980	And it was like, hold on, bitch, you got to wait until April to do that.
3322180	3325100	I think there was another big thing they gave away not that long ago.
3325980	3327620	I don't think it was Skyrim or anything like that.
3327620	3330180	But I think Bethesda launched, they really tried to get people on that
3330180	3331300	launcher with freebies.
3331300	3335620	And well, there's just too many launchers.
3336180	3340860	This one had to go and there's others that have to go to Ubisoft.
3341620	3346780	But yeah, Ubisoft, they don't see them doing it because they have their, don't
3346780	3348780	they have a marketplace built into that as well?
3348780	3350500	So them in origin.
3352580	3353260	Did they?
3353580	3356620	I thought, I thought you could buy the games through the Bethesda launcher.
3356620	3358180	I'm almost positive that was part of it.
3358180	3358740	It had to be.
3358780	3359540	I don't remember.
3359580	3359940	Yeah.
3359980	3364980	But yeah, you play is a little bit, come on, like Ubisoft is never going to do
3364980	3367820	what's right for anybody or their employees because they're still, you
3367820	3370900	know, protecting harassers of women at their company.
3370900	3374660	So of course, they're not going to have anybody's best interests other than
3374660	3375940	themselves in mind.
3375940	3377500	So they'll never get rid of that launcher.
3378340	3380900	Dark to see your reminds during QuakeCon.
3380900	3384700	And then at this last year's, they let people upgrade to Quake Remastered for
3384700	3386100	free if you had the original.
3386100	3386300	Yeah.
3386340	3389300	So if you've, if you've just had that installer sitting on your computer
3389300	3392460	grabbing freebies, I think about our listener in the past, who I haven't seen
3392460	3395900	in a while, but he used to always call in about the game deals and stuff and
3396100	3396700	freebies.
3396700	3399900	And I'm thinking like that guy just got a big payoff with this.
3399900	3403500	If he's been collecting the Bethesda, he's going to have a steam library.
3403500	3405300	It's going to really increase in size after this.
3406020	3409740	As Stu and Hanumat says, they gave away a ton of games in that game awards video.
3409740	3411940	That was nothing but a long line of free game codes.
3411940	3413740	Yes, that's, that's very true.
3413820	3414340	Very true.
3415060	3415340	All right.
3415340	3419380	Well, I know we weren't here last week, but there was at least one really big
3419380	3421980	headline from last week that I think we ought to touch on.
3421980	3425180	There was more than one, but I think this is really the big one that a lot of people
3425180	3425860	were talking about.
3426180	3431820	And that is the fact that Nintendo plans to end the Wii U and 3DS eShop purchases.
3431820	3434740	And that is going to end in March of 2023.
3434940	3440500	So you still have some time, but not a lot because the clock actually starts ticking
3440500	3441060	in May.
3441420	3447140	So on May 23rd of 2022, you will no longer be able to use a credit card to add funds
3447140	3449580	to your eShop account via Wii U or 3DS.
3449860	3454380	On August 29th, you can't use eShop cards to add funds anymore either.
3454700	3458980	You can still use download codes, but only until March when everything sunsets.
3459300	3465420	So now I believe if you already have downloaded games, you will still be able
3465420	3468100	to download them because that's still the case on the Wii.
3468300	3472860	They closed the Wii eShop some time ago, but you can still download old titles there.
3473060	3474340	For how much longer?
3474620	3475220	Who knows?
3475700	3478540	But Wii U and 3DS is going to be closing.
3478540	3483940	And that's a pretty big deal because obviously the 3DS had a huge long life.
3484340	3488300	There's a lot of titles on there you can't play anywhere else.
3488940	3492740	Somebody put together a list of like 2,000 titles off the top of my head.
3492940	3495340	Harmonite was one that the Pokemon Company did.
3495500	3499340	There's a lot of games on the 3DS that were only ever on the 3DS.
3499700	3503340	And right now you think the Switch is backwards compatible?
3504780	3508500	Wouldn't that be nice if your digital library would just spill onto the Switch?
3508500	3510660	You could play it in vertical and have the two screens.
3511940	3512860	That's not going to happen.
3513940	3516220	So does Nintendo.
3516420	3519540	And again, I don't like to think it's because they're assholes, but.
3522020	3524460	Then somebody's got to give me to tell me what it is.
3524780	3527020	The emulation isn't working right or something.
3527020	3527580	I don't know.
3528740	3532340	Nintendo is also not above putting out emulators that don't work completely.
3532340	3535220	And we've seen that before and we'll see that again, I'm sure.
3536300	3541340	Sjoan Hunter Matt in chat says, Nintendo doesn't understand game preservation and it's really sad.
3542380	3546620	Mike Deff says, Harmonite and a horse game with cards that was developed by Game Freak.
3546620	3546980	Yeah.
3547340	3553460	Dejirama S says, it would be nice if they put out a 3DS adapter kit to play 3DS games on docked Switch consoles.
3553460	3554540	God, I wish.
3554580	3555340	I wish.
3556660	3561980	Especially from a company that used to do things like the Game Boy Advance player for the GameCube.
3561980	3563340	How badass was that?
3563540	3565900	And then when you could like hook everything together and.
3567780	3571980	Or just make something like the PlayStation TV.
3572220	3573220	Yeah, I know.
3573220	3573620	I know.
3573820	3576660	Well, of course, that didn't end up working out in the long run either, now did it?
3577300	3578020	Yeah, it didn't.
3578020	3580420	But that's because I don't think the Vita was like super.
3580420	3584140	I mean, I guess the Vita is somewhat popular, but like, yeah, it was just.
3585620	3592740	I don't know, it was kind of unfortunate that that didn't work out because that's it's a pretty awesome device for the cost.
3592940	3604500	Now, talking about game preservation, it's been brought up that the Wii U doesn't have the Netflix style system that the Switch does.
3604500	3606420	You bought games a la carte then.
3606780	3613140	And even though I seem to recall when the Wii U is out, many of us were saying Nintendo should switch to a Netflix system.
3613500	3614380	They have.
3614660	3624900	But I think because unfortunately, the Netflix has not been as vast of a library as people would have thought because of licensing issues and a lot of the third party developers kind of doing their own things.
3625420	3640460	Now people are clamoring for the releases that were on the Wii U, because let's be real, there were things that were on the Wii U, especially from companies like Konami and stuff that don't exist on the Switch Online library.
3640940	3649100	And Nintendo basically said, we don't have any plans to make this accessible on the Switch or anything like that.
3649100	3651420	They're just kind of pushing the Switch Online library.
3651580	3654540	And as far as the retro virtual console titles.
3655540	3658980	That's it, you better grab them while you still can on the Wii U.
3659740	3676220	I do think this news was very interestingly timed when the two biggest obvious ones, Earthbound and Earthbound Beginnings, if those hadn't made it to Switch yet, Twitter wouldn't have shut up about anything else, I guarantee it.
3676940	3685860	But because it's interesting that those two come over and then the very next week we're shutting it down and people still have things to complain about.
3686260	3697180	The Internet will always have things to complain about, but those two, if they were still missing, would have been a huge, huge deal because Earthbound Beginnings, its first go was on the Wii U.
3698180	3705700	Some people are thinking it might be about the 10th anniversary of the system and Dark Sakura just unlocked the secret there.
3706580	3710420	Because I don't have the audio turned off on my on my phone.
3710500	3710980	There you go.
3711020	3712860	The audio is a mess tonight anyway.
3712860	3713420	Sorry, guys.
3713420	3714460	We'll work on it through the next week.
3714460	3715500	Some people are texting me.
3715500	3716740	I'm like, why are you texting me?
3716780	3717460	That's fine.
3717460	3719540	I have Discord notifications from earlier.
3719980	3720580	What can you do?
3722300	3731020	But anyway, they basically were waiting for the Wii U to turn 10 years old, which I didn't realize the Wii U turns 10 years old in November.
3731020	3732420	So this all will happen.
3732420	3736980	The shutdown will be after the Wii U's 10 year anniversary, which is wild to me.
3737700	3745340	An ex Nintendo employee said Nintendo knows it has to support a product for a minimum of 10 years or they risk some class action.
3746740	3753140	I feel like there's companies that support things a lot shorter than that, and they don't face any type of class action.
3753460	3764060	Like a lot of the mobile phones, Apple, you know, and a lot of those companies, Samsung, they're usually applauded for how long they do last.
3764060	3766500	But it's not usually more than six or seven years.
3766700	3769060	So it's interesting that Nintendo puts the line at 10.
3769340	3771300	So but not that I'm complaining.
3771660	3772620	It's just interesting.
3772620	3777780	That's all. The Wii U sold 13.5 million units in its lifetime.
3777780	3780940	The 3DS, 75.7 million.
3781300	3784660	By the way, the Video Game History Foundation put out a tweet about all this.
3785420	3793700	While it is unfortunate that people won't be able to purchase digital 3DS or Wii U games anymore, we understand the business reality that went into this decision.
3794100	3801060	What we don't understand is what path Nintendo expects its fans to take should they wish to play these games in the future.
3801540	3812700	As a paying member of the Entertainment Software Association, Nintendo actively funds lobbying that prevents even libraries from being able to provide legal access to these games.
3812980	3823100	Not providing commercial access is understandable, but preventing institutional work to preserve these titles on top of that is actively destructive to the video game history.
3823460	3832580	We encourage ESA members like Nintendo to rethink their position on this issue and work with existing institutions to find a solution.
3832900	3842220	A very tactful message from the Video Game History Foundation, because in my mind, I'm just waving a pirate flag all around going, I know how I'm going to fix the problem.
3842220	3850260	Hey, if Nintendo gives us something legit, I am more than happy to support it. I really am.
3850500	3863180	But until then, Arr matey, like yo ho ho, I want to play some of those 3DS exclusive download games that, you know, I don't even know my 3DS's battery works anymore.
3863180	3865620	It probably does. I haven't played it in a while.
3865620	3874340	ZenMonkey11 says, nice way to show thanks to your Wii U day one buyers, Nintendo, shutting them down on the day they bought it.
3875020	3880300	Well, it's 10 and a half years after the fact, to be fair.
3880300	3883140	But hey, you know what is interesting?
3883140	3895540	I bet the value of a Wii U is really high right now because you can also play like, my Wii is worthless because I transferred all of my Wii titles to my Wii U at some point.
3895820	3897980	So my Wii U's got everything on it.
3898340	3902380	So anyway, we'll see.
3902380	3904180	We'll see what develops on that front.
3904180	3912220	And if Nintendo ever decides to do something about embracing archive and emulation and all that stuff.
3912660	3913980	Meanwhile, Dark Siren.
3914220	3916060	I don't have a lot of hopes for Nintendo.
3916060	3917380	I'm going to be perfectly honest.
3917380	3917980	I don't either.
3918860	3921580	I mean, hope is, is.
3922860	3923220	Yeah.
3924220	3928900	I hope they're making considerations for their next system, if nothing else, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
3929660	3931180	No, I wouldn't either.
3932100	3934140	You know, you need it to breathe anyway.
3934900	3935700	So.
3936780	3944620	Speaking of some other bad news, Nvidia reported that they were, quote, completely compromised by a cyber attack.
3946580	3952740	They said that their business was taken offline for a couple of days because of a malicious network intrusion.
3953860	3959940	It affected everything from email to developer tools that had already been suffering outages.
3960620	3963860	They don't know if anything has been stolen or deleted.
3965020	3970860	If anything has affected the customers either, but it's, it's pretty bad.
3970860	3972660	They're doing a full investigation right now.
3972660	3974380	They don't have any really anything to share.
3975380	3989020	They're a cybersecurity, actually, there's a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey named Alan Woodward that is saying that Nvidia's likely shut down their internal systems to minimize a risk of further damage.
3989500	3995340	That, you know, better to keep the system completely down rather than have anything keep poking at it, you know.
3995340	4012500	And I mean, they, they've already been attacked before there was a, a list of 100 or so, actually more than 100s of games, unannounced games that were data mined from GeForce Now, some of which that have been announced.
4013940	4019380	And of course, as people are want, they want to see is Russia involved and so far, they don't have any links.
4020380	4022420	I think the opposite is going on.
4022420	4027500	We're hearing about and I don't know how much of it but like anonymous is apparently attacking Russian stuff.
4027500	4032340	It's very, very fascinating to watch the drama on Twitter and other social media.
4032660	4042140	But anyway, we don't love to see game companies get attacked, but I feel like at the same time it comes with the territory, if there's an exploit, somebody's going to exploit it.
4042140	4051220	Questbuster in chat says, if I recall correctly, there was an update to this that suggested they did a reverse hack and encrypted the terabyte of data that was stolen.
4052220	4053220	Interesting.
4054220	4056140	I've never, I've never heard of that.
4056140	4057140	No take backsies.
4058140	4059140	That's interesting.
4059140	4061140	That's a loud follow up.
4061140	4062140	All right.
4062140	4068140	So Steam Decks are starting to go out and we're starting to see a lot of press reviews of those.
4068140	4073140	I have yet to hold one in my hand, but we're getting a lot of Steam news in the past few days.
4073140	4076140	I feel like because of like a lot of Gabe interviews are showing up.
4076140	4077140	Right, Loki?
4081140	4082140	We lose Loki.
4085140	4086140	Hi.
4086140	4087140	Hi, Loki.
4087140	4088140	Are we to you or are we back to me?
4088140	4089140	I'm sorry.
4091140	4093140	No, I think we're back to me.
4093140	4095140	So let's talk about games pass.
4095140	4098140	So the PC version of games pass there.
4098140	4111140	There was a comment from Valve basically or Gabe Newell, I think actually was talking about it, but basically that Valve would be open to having games pass, at least the PC version of it available on Steam.
4111140	4117140	I don't think it's something we think ourselves or we need to do ourselves building a subscription service at this time.
4117140	4123140	But for their customers is clearly a popular option, and we'd be more than happy to work with them to get that on Steam.
4123140	4124140	Perfect.
4124140	4125140	Awesome.
4125140	4126140	To me, I don't know.
4126140	4132140	Like, it's it'd be nice to have everything kind of in one one spot, but it's not a deal breaker concern.
4132140	4133140	It's a PC.
4133140	4136140	You know, it's just kind of like, you know, it's not a deal breaker.
4136140	4142140	You know, I open another app instead to download games pass games, but it would be cool to see that integrated.
4142140	4146140	Maybe that is something that they can do, especially since Microsoft's pretty keen on putting their games on Steam.
4146140	4149140	So I'm not sure what Microsoft gets out of that.
4149140	4152140	But at the same time, yeah, Microsoft's been putting their games on Steam.
4152140	4153140	People have been buying them.
4153140	4159140	We talked about the whole there's too many launchers and now the weak ones like Bethesda's launcher are starting to fall out.
4159140	4162140	So I guess in that regard, it does make sense.
4162140	4166140	But it does also still feel a little bit like I don't know if they need it.
4166140	4169140	But I'm also not using game pass on PC a lot.
4169140	4172140	I use it, but I don't use it a lot.
4172140	4176140	So maybe just because I have the occasional onesie twosie game, it doesn't quite feel the same.
4176140	4177140	I don't know.
4177140	4184140	Yeah, I haven't really been utilizing it too much, but it would be cool, though, like just to have everything in one place.
4184140	4194140	It would be cool, though, like just to have everything in one, you know, library, at least try to consolidate those libraries, because it does kind of sucks like, you know, OK, I want to play this game.
4194140	4197140	Which library do I have it in, you know, type of thing.
4197140	4200140	It would be kind of cool.
4200140	4203140	I mean, at least they're open to it.
4203140	4208140	So that's something it might push, you know, epic to be open to it as well.
4208140	4211140	That would be interesting.
4211140	4212140	All right.
4212140	4221140	We'll see what develops with that, especially with the Steam Deck now being a player, being able to get, you know, game pass games on that would be pretty exciting.
4221140	4224140	SG100Matt says they don't need it yet.
4224140	4227140	I'm not sure the Epic Game Store is hurting Steam yet.
4227140	4230140	If they really wanted to one up the Epic Store, then maybe.
4230140	4232140	It is interesting, though.
4233140	4241140	It is interesting, though, I feel like we're getting a flurry of Valve news over the weekend because of the Steam Deck's release and, you know, all that.
4241140	4247140	So I think there was, well, Gabe Newell did like an interview with PC Gamer about a different bunch of stuff, too.
4247140	4253140	So and I think they also have I don't know if they have like a livestream or some sort of event or something like that.
4253140	4257140	But like I know there is a bunch of news, yeah, from Valve as well.
4258140	4263140	SheHulk10 in chat says Steam should come to console Xbox Series X.
4263140	4265140	That would be interesting.
4265140	4268140	But you've got to think we've got to go in the wayback machine.
4268140	4270140	We've got to go way back.
4270140	4278140	But you may recall on the PlayStation 3 when Portal 2 was released, Valve had Steam built into that.
4278140	4285140	Most people forgot it because the PlayStation hack happened like not even a month later.
4285140	4291140	And I think most people got through Portal 2 by the time the PlayStation Network came back online.
4291140	4296140	But Steam has been baked into a console that wasn't in the orange box.
4296140	4301140	But the orange box might have been too soon because that was the 360 in PlayStation 2 era?
4301140	4302140	Yeah.
4302140	4303140	No, was it the PlayStation 3?
4303140	4305140	No, it was PlayStation 3.
4305140	4307140	Yeah, so okay.
4307140	4309140	But Steam wasn't baked into that yet.
4309140	4312140	But they did bake it into Portal 2.
4312140	4314140	So we have seen Steam on a console.
4314140	4317140	So that would be interesting and maybe something that Steam could leverage to get out of that.
4317140	4319140	But we'll see. We'll see.
4319140	4322140	Digirama S says doesn't Gabe hate Microsoft?
4322140	4324140	Did you hear what we were just talking about?
4324140	4325140	Apparently not.
4325140	4326140	Maybe not.
4326140	4328140	Didn't they have Microsoft games on Steam?
4328140	4332140	On Steam, I don't think that they hate.
4332140	4334140	I don't see why he would hate them.
4334140	4335140	No, I don't either.
4335140	4337140	Especially because they all run in the same town.
4337140	4341140	Gabe is going to see the Microsoft people at parties and industry things.
4341140	4343140	I think hate is a strong word.
4344140	4345140	So, yeah.
4345140	4346140	All right.
4346140	4354140	Let's talk about a pair of retro stories having to do with the Nintendo Switch and some retro updates.
4354140	4357140	One of them is the Taito Milestones Collection.
4357140	4360140	That is going to be becoming a series.
4360140	4366140	It was announced for the Switch in Japan, and it's going to have 10 classic Taito arcade games in it.
4366140	4376140	Alpine Ski, Jack and Pop, Elevator Action, The Fairyland Story, Frontline, Haley's Comet, The Ninja Warriors, Kix, Space Seeker, and Wild Western.
4376140	4379140	Yeah, that was the only one you were listening for, right?
4379140	4382140	But that's just going to be the first of several.
4382140	4386140	There will be more Taito arcade games in the future, so that's pretty cool.
4386140	4389140	Hamster is putting this together, and I believe they do.
4389140	4395140	Hamster publishes the arcade archives, I think.
4395140	4399140	I'm not crossing my wires there, so I'm sure there will be more.
4399140	4406140	Yeah, Taito has done those classic collections before, so it's about time we got them on the Switch.
4406140	4414140	This is more, I guess, retro adjacent, but let's talk about Tempest 4000, shall we?
4414140	4418140	Because Tempest 4000 is coming out on the Nintendo Switch.
4418140	4422140	It's going to be out on the Switch starting March 22nd, available in the eShop.
4422140	4429140	It is the, I guess, follow-up of sorts to Tempest 2000. I thought there was a 3000 at one point, though.
4429140	4431140	There was. It was a Jaguar one.
4431140	4432140	That's right, okay.
4432140	4438140	But Tempest 4000 is coming, and that is already available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
4438140	4443140	So you may have already played this, but it will be coming out on the Switch on March 22nd as well.
4443140	4452140	So a retro title there, if that is your thing, which I know we are very into retro here at Orange Lounge Radio, right?
4452140	4453140	Oh, yeah.
4453140	4457140	In fact, we love retro so much, we have a weekly segment that we dedicate to it.
4457140	4476140	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4476140	4479140	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4479140	4482140	And Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game tonight?
4482140	4484140	I picked Metroid Fusion.
4485140	4493140	So Metroid Fusion, first of all, came out in 2002 in North America, November 17th.
4493140	4499140	And actually it came out here before it came out in Japan, which was February 14th, 2003.
4499140	4503140	It didn't come out in China until March 2nd, 2006.
4503140	4509140	But this is an action-adventure game published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance.
4509140	4512140	It was developed by Nintendo R&D.
4512140	4516140	It also is the same group that did Super Metroid.
4516140	4523140	And you are playing as Samus Aran, who is fighting against these parasites known as X.
4523140	4527140	So it's a lot more, you know, typical Metroid stuff.
4527140	4535140	You know, it's jumping and running from things and shooting things and, you know, spin dashes and all of that.
4536140	4539140	You can also play this...
4539140	4542140	It actually was released the day after Metroid Prime came out.
4542140	4549140	And you can link the games via the GameCube Game Boy Advance link cable for extra content for Metroid Prime.
4549140	4551140	It was really good.
4551140	4559140	It was a little bit shorter than Super Metroid, but it had all the great control, music, graphics.
4559140	4567140	It was very well received, and it also included a handheld game of the year at the 2002 Interactive Achievement Awards.
4567140	4571140	It just got many, many positives.
4571140	4576140	And of course, Metroid Dread, the last one that was out on Switch, is a direct sequel.
4576140	4592140	So the big thing with this one is that Samus has this parasite that she's going against and finds that the parasites will replicate their host's appearance.
4592140	4609140	And basically, eventually, she has to fight a version of herself that has been stalking her around, the SA-X, and it looks like her.
4609140	4612140	And then, of course, there's some Metroids involved.
4612140	4618140	I don't want to... Well, okay, I'm going to go ahead and spoil it because it's been out for freaking ever.
4619140	4624140	The animals that you save at the end of Super Metroid save you.
4624140	4628140	Always save the animals. They come back to save your ass.
4628140	4637140	But anyway, going a bit more into the story about this is that Nintendo confirmed a GBA Metroid game in 2001.
4637140	4644140	Ken Lobb, which is Nintendo of America's director of game development, confirmed that it was a new game, not a port.
4644140	4653140	And they showed footage at 2001 E3 under the name of Metroid 4, and it had Samus in a dark suit, running on walls and ceilings.
4653140	4657140	It was more simple, a little more Game Boy color-like.
4657140	4664140	And then, of course, it had all been updated as of EA E3 2002.
4665140	4672140	It was... I mean, basically, it mimics Super Metroid being designed by the two team.
4672140	4676140	It was also the first 2D Metroid game that had animated cutscenes.
4676140	4685140	And it was written and directed by Sakamoto Yoshio, who was the series' designer.
4685140	4692140	So it was just... The big thing is that they wanted to do a very original story for it.
4692140	4698140	They wanted to do something that people hadn't played before, even though it was just a previous Metroid game.
4698140	4705140	So they altered the story and they put in the idea of the parasites.
4705140	4708140	I mean, it is not an easy game, I'll tell you that right now.
4708140	4720140	But at any rate, for all of the cutscenes, the music needed to fit the dialogue.
4720140	4727140	And so that's why the music is a little bit more serious and ambient rather than melodic.
4727140	4731140	Because it needed to be something that would go in with this.
4732140	4745140	They wanted to look for voice actors, but really the only voices that were used was announcements for ROM cartridge limitations.
4745140	4751140	So the game did come out November 18th, 2002. August 22nd, 2002.
4751140	4756140	Nintendo announced that it would be able to connect to Metroid Prime on GameCube.
4756140	4766140	And there's also a two-disc soundtrack album, which is the Prime Infusion original soundtracks done by Skitron.
4766140	4771140	And it had also some arranged tracks on there, which was really nice.
4771140	4779140	It was re-released for Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console as part of the 3DS Ambassadors program.
4779140	4783140	It was one of ten Game Boy Advance games that was included.
4783140	4795140	And then Iwata himself actually revealed that Metroid Fusion was going to be among the first three Game Boy Advance games to be released on the Wii U Virtual Console.
4795140	4802140	At any rate, like I said, it's been super, super well received.
4802140	4805140	Famitsu gave it a 34 out of 40. Pretty good.
4806140	4811140	Everywhere else it's like 10 out of 10, 9 out of 10, 8 out of 10, 88%.
4811140	4817140	I think the lowest score on this is roughly an 85%.
4817140	4823140	Metacritic gave it a 92 out of 100. Game rankings is 91.23%.
4823140	4827140	It's been considered, like I said, the Handheld Game of the Year.
4827140	4838140	It was chosen as Best Game Boy Adventure game by IGN, Best Action Game on the Game Boy Advance by GameSpot.
4838140	4844140	It was runner-up for GameSpot's Best Sound, Best Graphics, Best Story, and overall Game of the Year.
4844140	4850140	As far as sales go, it has sold over 1.6 million units worldwide in its debut week.
4850140	4859140	It sold more than 100,000 units in North America and finished November with 199,723 copies sold in the U.S. alone.
4859140	4871140	Total revenue was $5,590,768 and it made it the third best selling Game Boy Advance game that month and 10th best over all gaming platforms.
4871140	4878140	It went on to sell 940,000 copies by August of 2006.
4878140	4881140	Revenue is exceeding $27 million.
4881140	4896140	As of 2006 in America, it was the 21st highest selling game for any of the present handheld systems at that time, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, or PSP.
4896140	4902140	It's actually sold quite well in Japan as well as in 2004. It sold 180,000 units in Japan.
4903140	4912140	And then, of course, like I said, it has a sequel. Metroid Dread is this game's direct sequel developed by Nintendo and Mercury Steam.
4912140	4914140	And that's it.
4920140	4921140	For sure.
4933140	4934140	There you go.
4943140	4950140	Yeah, let's talk about the free with your subscription games you can get through PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold.
4951140	4961140	So with PlayStation Plus, we're going to be getting Ark Survival Evolved, Team Sonic Racing and Ghosts of Tsushima Legends on PlayStation 4.
4961140	4969140	And then on PlayStation 5, Ghost Runner and then Ghosts of Tsushima Legends as well there.
4969140	4977140	And then, of course, let's see the Xbox games with gold.
4977140	4989140	We're going to be getting looks like the Flame in the Flood and Sacred 2 Fallen Angel, Street Power Soccer and SpongeBob's Truth or Square.
4989140	4994140	And those are the games that are available through that service as well.
4994140	5003140	I actually I've been forgetting to download these games or mark them in my catalog, especially with Game Pass and stuff.
5003140	5007140	It's kind of out of the way, especially if you're not on console to do that.
5007140	5010140	You have to go to the Xbox store and stuff.
5010140	5015140	And I just want to say a quick before you get to the next story, a quick sorry for the unexpected silence there.
5015140	5017140	I was hard muted through OBS.
5017140	5020140	You got you guys could hear me on Discord and that's why the show kept moving.
5020140	5022140	But the listeners were like, you're muted, you're muted.
5022140	5026140	And that's just one of those things we're getting used to with the new space.
5026140	5028140	Sorry, y'all. We'll get there.
5028140	5035140	And then out of the blue, there's a new Portal game sort of coming out.
5035140	5040140	So Aperture Death Job is a simulator game that's being put out.
5040140	5042140	I thought you said Aperture Death Job.
5042140	5043140	And I was like, oh, exciting.
5043140	5045140	No, no, Death Job.
5045140	5048140	And that's coming out for free on March 1st.
5048140	5055140	And it's made, I think, for the Steam Deck.
5055140	5061140	They made it for that, but I'm assuming that you can play it on other things as well.
5061140	5068140	Curious, though, I'm wondering if this is just a thing to kind of promote the Steam Deck
5069140	5075140	or if this is like a teaser for a Portal 3 type of thing, like an ARG or something.
5075140	5080140	But I guess we will have to find out once it comes out March 1st.
5080140	5082140	Don't tease me like that.
5082140	5083140	But I hope so.
5083140	5085140	It looks silly either way.
5085140	5086140	Yeah.
5086140	5088140	Be a fun one to stream.
5088140	5090140	Dark Soccer.
5090140	5095140	So I got everything hidden by my camera is the problem.
5096140	5097140	Let me respond to Bobby real quick.
5097140	5098140	Sorry.
5098140	5100140	Saying they stated it was just a tech demo.
5100140	5103140	You mean GLaDOS might lie to us?
5105140	5107140	Sorry, Jamie.
5107140	5108140	Uh-huh.
5108140	5116140	Anyway, so Nintendo Switch Online has fixed Ocarina of Time's water temple room
5116140	5119140	and the Paper Mario wot crash.
5120140	5125140	So the I'm losing like every window in front of me.
5129140	5132140	The fix actually went live.
5134140	5135140	I apologize.
5135140	5138140	I'm actually having 50,000.
5138140	5141140	I was having 50,000 things open at the same time.
5141140	5143140	I clicked the wrong thing.
5143140	5146140	I can see your screen flashing so I can tell something crazy is going on.
5146140	5148140	Yeah, no, I clicked something.
5148140	5151140	And I don't know what it was so sorry about it.
5151140	5158140	Anyway, they also have added Majora's Mask as a new game.
5158140	5161140	And like I said, fixed those other things.
5161140	5168140	They've also made sure that they also did other improvements of Ocarina of Time
5168140	5170140	as far as its playability.
5172140	5173140	Other news.
5173140	5175140	And this one I'm pretty excited about.
5175140	5177140	Now I have backed this game.
5177140	5179140	I am looking forward to it.
5179140	5183140	Called Drag Her, which is a drag queen fighting game.
5183140	5187140	And they just got Ben DiLaCreme for it.
5187140	5189140	And that makes me happy.
5189140	5191140	The little teaser is so funny.
5191140	5196140	The computer's like, are you going to quit in the middle of the competition?
5196140	5198140	Only if I'm winning.
5198140	5200140	That was pretty great.
5200140	5205140	But yeah, some of the other ones like it has Tammy Brown in it and Jiggly.
5205140	5209140	And who else did I see in there?
5209140	5210140	Oh, Kimchi.
5210140	5211140	Alaska was in there, right?
5211140	5212140	Alaska, yeah.
5212140	5216140	Any non-Drag Race drag queens or is they pretty much relying on that franchise
5216140	5219140	to help bring the visibility to the game?
5219140	5222140	Well, I think honestly this is the best way to get visibility for it
5222140	5227140	is to focus on the big names that everyone knows.
5227140	5228140	Oh, guess who else actually?
5228140	5230140	Landon Thider is in it.
5230140	5231140	Okay, that's cool.
5231140	5233140	Okay, so a Dragula, a king in it.
5233140	5234140	That's cool.
5234140	5235140	Okay.
5235140	5238140	So I think that's really awesome because, I mean, Landon Thider,
5238140	5243140	having seen him perform, super talented king there.
5243140	5244140	Yeah.
5244140	5245140	Cool.
5245140	5246140	Yeah.
5246140	5247140	All right.
5247140	5249140	Pretty cool about that.
5249140	5250140	All right.
5250140	5253140	And with that, we're going to travel around the world and check out some games
5253140	5257140	you can play a little sooner than drag queen fighting games,
5257140	5259140	as much as I know you're looking forward to that, Loki.
5259140	5260140	Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.?
5260140	5262140	I am very much looking forward to that.
5262140	5264140	You got to try it at least once.
5264140	5269140	Well, you know, not the drag queen fighting games, but there's that.
5269140	5272140	I don't know if it's a drag queen game, but that that.
5272140	5277140	Oh, God, it's it's a FPS game that's done like the style of like Doom,
5277140	5281140	but it's like you're making people fabulous, like putting clothes on them
5281140	5283140	or something. You have a clothes gun.
5283140	5284140	So there's that.
5284140	5285140	I don't remember that.
5285140	5286140	Yeah.
5286140	5287140	Yes, a five shooter.
5287140	5288140	What is something like that?
5288140	5289140	Yeah, like I can't remember.
5289140	5291140	I swear I've had it.
5291140	5292140	I've had it.
5292140	5294140	I think they actually have that.
5294140	5296140	But I think I actually had that to work.
5296140	5297140	I don't know what this game is.
5297140	5299140	Jack, get to work.
5299140	5301140	I had it in my background for a while.
5301140	5304140	I can I could tell you what the game is because I have it on my steam wish list,
5304140	5312140	but it is.
5312140	5314140	Fashion police squad.
5314140	5315140	That sounds awesome.
5315140	5316140	Yes.
5316140	5317140	Yes.
5317140	5318140	It's coming out sometime this year.
5318140	5323140	OK, so something we can do here now
5323140	5324140	that I couldn't do before.
5324140	5327140	So this is and this is something on steam.
5327140	5328140	Yes.
5328140	5330140	OK. Oh, my gosh.
5330140	5331140	What the heck is this?
5331140	5332140	OK, let's see.
5332140	5336140	So I'm going to I'm going to fast forward here and then we're going to do that.
5336140	5339140	And you do see them cut out for just a minute.
5339140	5342140	But now I can actually see the game.
5342140	5345140	OK, so
5346140	5347140	so sorry.
5347140	5349140	This does not make great for podcast.
5349140	5351140	So it's definitely what Loki was describing.
5351140	5356140	It's a first person shooter and it looks like it's very pixelated.
5356140	5358140	Oh, the fashion police dispatch.
5358140	5360140	We have this is Officer Dez.
5360140	5363140	There's a thin red ribbon blocking my way to the crime scene.
5363140	5364140	This is ridiculous.
5364140	5365140	I love it.
5365140	5366140	I have to check that out.
5366140	5367140	That's funny.
5367140	5368140	All right.
5368140	5372140	And yes, I and hopefully I can make that work a little smoother in the future,
5372140	5374140	but I can actually do drop in YouTube's now.
5374140	5375140	So that'll be fun.
5375140	5377140	Yeah, that's awesome.
5377140	5380140	Anyways, so back to release dates, though.
5380140	5386140	So this week we've got Guild Wars two end of dragons coming out on PC.
5386140	5389140	LX two.
5389140	5391140	And did I just show my.
5391140	5394140	Or are you like to.
5394140	5399140	That's on a PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series
5399140	5405140	far the changing tides on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5405140	5410140	Shadow Warrior three on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5410140	5416140	Babylon's fall on PC, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.
5416140	5419140	And then, of course, the big ones for the week.
5419140	5426140	Gran Turismo seven on PlayStation four and PlayStation five and triangle strategy on Nintendo Switch.
5427140	5430140	Why is triangle man now playing in my head?
5432140	5435140	Because I said trying the things a triangle can.
5435140	5436140	Sorry.
5436140	5437140	Sorry for the chaos.
5437140	5439140	I'm sure that I was trying to particle man.
5439140	5442140	My discord notifications are coming through on stream, so I was trying to mute those.
5442140	5444140	So you guys wouldn't hear those about that.
5444140	5445140	Put yourself in the stream mode.
5445140	5446140	Yeah.
5446140	5447140	And then I end up showing.
5447140	5454140	Thank God my phone number is mostly blocked out because it just totally not to shine a light on it, but it totally did.
5454140	5463140	So anyway, let's move on to Japan and talk about the releases there this week in Japan.
5463140	5465140	We also have triangle strategy getting released there.
5465140	5467140	That's pretty cool.
5467140	5469140	And that is pretty much the big release on the Nintendo Switch.
5469140	5471140	There's not a lot else to look forward to on the switch.
5471140	5479140	But if you go to the PlayStation five, we also have Babylon's fall, which is coming out there and Gran Turismo seven, kind of a big deal.
5479140	5483140	And the rotten city is coming out on the PlayStation five as well.
5483140	5486140	So busy week in Japan, dark Sakura.
5486140	5487140	How about the UK?
5487140	5491140	It's not super busy, but busy ish on the first.
5491140	5499140	We have Alex to on console for PlayStation, Xbox and PC.
5499140	5504140	We have on the third Babylon's fall for PlayStation on the fourth.
5504140	5506140	We have a lot more.
5506140	5508140	We have Gran Turismo seven.
5508140	5514140	We have triangle strategy for Switch Ryan's rescue squad for the big three.
5514140	5518140	We have Ash Walker's for Switch, which actually looks kind of cool.
5518140	5522140	We have Death's Gambit afterlife also on Switch.
5522140	5526140	And that is it for that week.
5526140	5527140	All right.
5527140	5533140	Just a few more stories for you, and then we're going to get to the listener roundtable and see how that goes tonight with this new setup.
5533140	5534140	We'll see.
5534140	5536140	I don't even have a scene for discord.
5536140	5537140	I'll have to build one on the fly.
5537140	5538140	We'll see how that goes.
5538140	5541140	Meanwhile, though, we will get to our next story.
5541140	5542140	Loki.
5542140	5551140	Yeah, so there's news regarding Call of Duty, and that is that there's not going to be a Call of Duty in 2023.
5551140	5554140	They're going to be taken a year off.
5554140	5562140	It's probably not so much that they're well, obviously, you know, they need some time to, you know, kind of work on the game.
5562140	5566140	It's not like that they're not going to be doing any Call of Duty content during that time.
5566140	5570140	They're actually going to be working on more of the Warzone stuff.
5570140	5579140	So there'll be stuff being done through their free to play game, but no mainline Call of Duty game that's going to be coming out in 2023.
5579140	5583140	So they'll be skipping that.
5583140	5584140	And then what else?
5584140	5593140	So also to go along with the unfortunate Activision news.
5593140	5611140	So the Call of Duty executives, I guess, or the Activision Blizzard folks, there is filings within the SEC that withheld some important information regarding the money that they're going to be getting from the merger.
5611140	5620140	So it sounds like that there's some of these execs are just trying to stay around for six to eight months after the deal goes through.
5620140	5629140	And they're going to get millions of dollars for, you know, some of these folks haven't even been tenured for a year or so.
5629140	5648140	But you know, for example, they've got their chief financial officer is getting $25.3 million, their chief operating officer $29 million, the administration officer 11.3 billion and legal officer $14.7 million.
5648140	5653140	And of course, Bobby Kotick is receiving quite a bit as well.
5653140	5654140	How convenient.
5654140	5655140	$20 million.
5655140	5656140	Yeah.
5656140	5657140	God.
5657140	5672140	So basically, yeah, so the SEC filing, it alleges that the deal is better for Activision Blizzard executives and board members than it is for the average investor.
5672140	5673140	Which, yeah, I agree.
5673140	5679140	You know, because when I if I buy stock in Activision, I'm like getting $20 million.
5679140	5683140	So already not as good as what I should be getting.
5683140	5684140	All right.
5684140	5686140	I need some news that's a little bit happier.
5686140	5689140	Dark Soccer, if you could entertain me in that department, please.
5689140	5690140	So something better news.
5690140	5692140	Oh, yeah, totally better news.
5692140	5697140	This will better except for one way my wallet.
5697140	5700140	So, yeah, because this ain't cheap.
5700140	5704140	And you didn't get those bonuses that Loki was just talking about.
5704140	5705140	Oh, God.
5705140	5708140	So let me just go go on this.
5708140	5714140	So Multimorphic has announced they are doing Weird Al's Museum of Natural Hilarity.
5714140	5715140	I am stoked.
5715140	5718140	Like, Dan woke me up and told me about this.
5718140	5728140	OK, so at any rate, it is going to be on the P3 system.
5728140	5738140	Which what P3 is, it's a modular a modular pinball table with a LCD screen underneath
5738140	5739140	it.
5739140	5741140	So you have interactive elements with the play field.
5741140	5742140	It looks really cool.
5742140	5743140	Yeah, they're really cool.
5743140	5747140	Well, I've played two of the games on there.
5747140	5752140	I played Lexi Lightspeed and I played whatever that second one came out was.
5752140	5756140	There's another one called Heist that's supposed to be a lot better than the other two, although
5756140	5758140	I really enjoyed Lexi Lightspeed.
5758140	5765140	But this is going to be the fourth in that series, as far as I'm aware.
5765140	5772140	And I mean, I really am just like completely stoked about it.
5772140	5778140	They got out, of course, to do all the voices, all the call outs, everything about it.
5778140	5785140	I am absolutely just completely, completely, completely floored by this.
5785140	5795140	And then also, you know, there's going to be a deluxe version of this that's going
5795140	5798140	to have an animated topper on it.
5798140	5799140	That looks awesome.
5799140	5801140	Yeah, well, we are going to get that one.
5801140	5802140	So that's the thing.
5802140	5803140	We are we are going to get that.
5803140	5817140	And the thing is, is that, OK, so the base P3 machine costs about $8,300.
5817140	5826140	The module for Weird Al's Museum of Natural Hilarity is $3,000.
5827140	5834140	The limited edition package is an additional $1,800.
5834140	5840140	So we are looking at roughly $14,000 for this pinball.
5840140	5841140	It's a car.
5841140	5842140	Roughly.
5842140	5843140	It's a car.
5843140	5844140	It's amazing.
5844140	5846140	That's hardly a car?
5846140	5848140	A used car.
5848140	5853140	That's buying a Yaris.
5853140	5854140	Game not.
5855140	5864140	Anyway, they also have other little upgrades, which we're also considering doing.
5864140	5868140	We want to get the enhanced flipper assembly.
5868140	5874140	We want to get all of the other major upgrades.
5874140	5879140	And I'm actually even kind of thinking about asking for Lexi light speed as well.
5879140	5883140	But we would probably just keep it permanently as Weird Al.
5884140	5891140	The orders for it are, are they already up or are they going up on the fourth?
5891140	5893140	I think they're going up on the fourth.
5895140	5897140	I'm actually going through the thing.
5897140	5899140	Yeah, I'm not seeing the date on it.
5899140	5909140	But like the song list has Amish Paradise, Like a Surgeon, My Balona, White Nerdy, Word Crimes, Dare to be Stupid, Germs, Fun Zone, Hardware Store, Harvey the Wonder Hamster.
5909140	5913140	And by the way, Harvey the Wonder Hamster is on his hamster wheel in the game.
5913140	5915140	It's awesome.
5915140	5922140	El Sousa, Mission Statement, Sports Song, Traffic Jam, Weasel Stomping Day, UHF, and You Make Me.
5922140	5924140	UHF, there's a UHF mode in it.
5924140	5929140	Okay, for those who do not know, UHF is very important to my marriage.
5929140	5931140	Do you know why?
5931140	5934140	Because of the reception you drank from the fire hose.
5934140	5937140	No, but we did find the marble in the oatmeal.
5937140	5946140	Anyway, when Dan and I got engaged, we were watching UHF on VHS.
5946140	5948140	No, I take that back. It was on DVD.
5948140	5950140	We were watching UHF.
5950140	5959140	We were drinking Manischewitz blackberry wine and cheap French bread and spinach dip from the grocery store.
5959140	5961140	We were broke as a joke back in those days.
5961140	5964140	But then we were like, you can get married.
5964140	5966140	Sure, eventually.
5966140	5968140	That was exactly how the proposal went.
5968140	5972140	I don't really remember who told who what, but we just decided.
5972140	5974140	Very romantic.
5974140	5983140	But years later, for our 10th anniversary, we went to see Weird Al with the mandatory fun tour.
5983140	5987140	We had front row seats and everything.
5987140	5991140	We brought him our DVD copy of UHF.
5991140	5993140	He signed it.
5994140	5996140	We told him the story.
5996140	5998140	And he's like, and you haven't divorced yet?
6004140	6006140	It was really cool.
6006140	6008140	Al is a sweetheart in person.
6008140	6013140	I'm very, very, very happy that something like this has come along.
6013140	6018140	I never expected a Weird Al pinball table.
6018140	6020140	Never in a million.
6020140	6025140	I'm so intensely pleased that all thoughts of Rush have left my head.
6025140	6031140	Sorry, I love Rush, but Weird Al has a very special place in this household.
6031140	6033140	Very special place.
6033140	6040140	What are your thoughts on the documentary that they're putting together with Daniel Radcliffe playing Weird Al?
6040140	6042140	That's not a documentary, Loki.
6042140	6047140	It's a mockumentary, I guess.
6048140	6052140	A biopic is usually what you would call this, yeah.
6052140	6055140	I don't know.
6055140	6057140	Probably very silly.
6057140	6059140	Everything should be very silly.
6059140	6060140	I can't wait.
6060140	6062140	We have so much Weird Al stuff.
6062140	6069140	Not like hyper collectors, but I have a copy on VHS, because it's the only way you can get it, of the complete Al.
6069140	6073140	As in spelled Z-O-M-P-L-E-A-T.
6073140	6082140	We've got box sets, I've got mandatory fun on vinyl autographed playing cards from the tour.
6082140	6087140	And we got our tour shirts and everything.
6087140	6094140	We were hoping that, well actually for our 15th anniversary, we were going to go to New Orleans.
6094140	6099140	And we said if we couldn't go to New Orleans, we'd go to another Weird Al thing, but COVID.
6099140	6102140	So we got iPads instead.
6102140	6117140	But anyway, going back to that, there's going to be a showing of it at the Texas Pinball Festival in Frisco, Texas, March 25th through 27th.
6117140	6122140	And if anybody goes to that, oh my god, just play it.
6122140	6133140	I want to see if Pina Gogo or the Golden State Pinball Fair that we do here that Dan and I work at, if they can get it.
6133140	6142140	Because we get Stern and Jersey Jack to display tables, so maybe we can get Multimorphic to come.
6142140	6144140	That'd be awesome.
6144140	6145140	Awesome.
6145140	6147140	I'm so excited.
6147140	6149140	This has never happened during OLR.
6150140	6155140	Maybe I can hope I don't show too much mess, but I'm going to pan down a little bit.
6155140	6158140	This has never, never happened.
6158140	6160140	Oh, he just, and now he's decided he's over.
6160140	6162140	He knew the camera.
6162140	6164140	He knew the camera was on him.
6164140	6165140	It's on the VOD.
6165140	6166140	Fuck it.
6166140	6167140	I'm leaving.
6167140	6168140	Clip it.
6168140	6170140	Clip it.
6170140	6171140	Okay.
6171140	6175140	That has never, ever happened during OLR.
6175140	6184140	I'm glad of the delay because I unpaused the internet version and I got to see it.
6184140	6187140	And I was just a second short of screenshotting it.
6187140	6188140	What a little asshole.
6188140	6189140	Look at this.
6189140	6190140	Look at this.
6190140	6191140	He did all that.
6191140	6192140	Oh, damn it.
6192140	6193140	I can't.
6193140	6194140	Sorry.
6194140	6195140	My place is still a mess.
6195140	6196140	Don't judge me.
6196140	6197140	It's all right.
6197140	6198140	You just moved.
6198140	6199140	He's lying down.
6199140	6200140	I do this.
6200140	6201140	He's just lying down, passed out.
6201140	6202140	Do you see him?
6202140	6204140	Do you see him being a drama queen over there?
6204140	6205140	Yeah, I see him.
6205140	6211140	He just decided to go lie down right over there just to be a fucking drama queen.
6211140	6213140	And now I'm not going to get my shot back the way it was.
6213140	6214140	All right.
6214140	6218140	I have so many pictures of other people's animals from streams.
6218140	6222140	Mostly I have pictures of Losing Colors dog, Odin.
6222140	6224140	But I'm mildly obsessed with Odin.
6224140	6227140	I can never touch a husky due to allergies.
6227140	6229140	But I'm obsessed with that dog.
6229140	6233140	So I'm so excited for Alan to start streaming because he actually set his up.
6233140	6236140	So the cat bed is on there.
6236140	6240140	So he's ready for a cat cam for when smush goes in there.
6240140	6241140	So we'll see.
6241140	6242140	We'll see.
6242140	6248140	I'm actually considering doing the same if I had an extra port to do it with is Midna
6248140	6253140	no longer will sleep on the chair behind me, but she sleeps in my work chair.
6253140	6259140	And I put a white towel down on the chair behind me so that Midna would show up on camera.
6259140	6260140	So.
6260140	6268140	The best game ready for the best getting rig ready for stream scene that I saw on YouTube
6268140	6275140	by Willie Mosbin had his cat licking a plexiglass like it was like a transparent plexiglass
6275140	6277140	thing with cat food on it.
6277140	6280140	And that that was his like getting ready for stream thing.
6280140	6282140	It was amazing.
6282140	6283140	That's fantastic.
6283140	6284140	That's great.
6284140	6288140	The one thing that sadly isn't coming through on stream so well and I just it's a lighting
6288140	6290140	thing, but you can probably see behind me.
6290140	6295140	I actually have orange lights in here, but it just needs to get lit up better.
6295140	6297140	I need to figure out how to make kind of red.
6297140	6299140	Yeah, that's right on.
6299140	6301140	Well, they and they change colors.
6301140	6305140	So you can actually I think if I just hit the change colors, you could actually have
6305140	6306140	a difference.
6306140	6307140	That's red.
6307140	6308140	So there's a little more.
6308140	6312140	I have two color changing bars, but the only place that I could put them was on the opposite
6312140	6314140	side of my camera.
6314140	6315140	So.
6316140	6321140	But you know what, you know what I would suggest doing are those hexagon lights.
6322140	6323140	Oh, that'll be cool.
6323140	6324140	We'll see.
6324140	6325140	We'll see on the back wall.
6325140	6330140	I wanted to do like lights that you could change on Twitch when I'm streaming, but we'll
6330140	6331140	see.
6331140	6332140	We'll see.
6332140	6333140	Sorry.
6333140	6334140	Talk to me.
6334140	6336140	I found a place to get some of those bulbs cheap.
6336140	6337140	And thank you.
6337140	6338140	I see the clips coming in.
6338140	6339140	Yeah.
6339140	6340140	I'll look at those later.
6340140	6343140	Plus, I want to show them to Alan, so be funny.
6343140	6344140	All right.
6344140	6345140	Let's move on.
6345140	6346140	We still have some more stories.
6346140	6349140	I think one more from Loki.
6353140	6354140	Right, Loki?
6354140	6355140	Yeah.
6355140	6356140	Sorry.
6356140	6357140	I was checking out the camera.
6357140	6358140	Oh, you're watching the clip.
6358140	6359140	I understand.
6359140	6360140	I understand.
6360140	6361140	And we'll take the podcast.
6361140	6363140	Folks, go over to twitch.tv slash vlog network.
6363140	6367140	And now there's a clip there of two of them actually about Smoosh in the new studio.
6367140	6370140	So I'm downloading it, by the way, so I can send it to you.
6370140	6372140	Oh, it's something you can watch.
6372140	6379140	Unlike watching Super Smash Brothers at Evo this year, because it's not going to be there,
6379140	6380140	unfortunately.
6380140	6387140	Nintendo has decided this year that they are not going to be including Super Smash Brothers
6387140	6389140	in Evo.
6389140	6396140	And apparently that they're hoping to be able to, you know, work with them again soon.
6396140	6400140	I don't know if this is because Evo was purchased by Sony.
6400140	6404140	And so maybe there's like some kind of, you know, confusion there.
6404140	6408140	It's probably something behind the scenes, some sort of like arrangement that's going
6408140	6412140	on, that maybe it was more favorable for Sony than Nintendo.
6412140	6420140	But for whatever reason, I want to say just like since that story was published, like
6420140	6425140	Nintendo has come out and talking about their own plans for Smash and that whole thing.
6425140	6429140	I don't know if that was somebody reporting on an earlier tweet or what, but I want to
6429140	6432140	say like multiple tournaments, like I agree.
6432140	6433140	I agree with you.
6433140	6434140	It's it's silly.
6434140	6437140	And I don't I don't think Sony's the one stopping it, though.
6437140	6438140	I really don't.
6438140	6440140	Just because they knew what they were buying.
6440140	6444140	And I don't see what they have to gain from that happening.
6444140	6448140	And I guess we can have a hand Nickelodeon All-Stars Brawl there.
6448140	6449140	Right.
6449140	6450140	I guess.
6450140	6452140	Who knows what's going to replace it?
6452140	6455140	That would be really funny, though.
6455140	6456140	All right.
6456140	6459140	And one more story for you guys tonight.
6459140	6463140	And I thought this was funny because we just talked about this on the show two weeks ago,
6463140	6464140	maybe three.
6464140	6468140	But we had talked about, hey, what did what did that guy from that made the Nestle emulator?
6468140	6469140	What did he end up doing?
6469140	6470140	Right.
6470140	6473140	And we had found out, oh, he went to work for EA and he was working on some of those
6473140	6479140	things because there was a GitHub thing about the emulator that was buried away.
6479140	6481140	So he had like a super Nestle that he'd written.
6481140	6484140	And basically that code was in an EA game on the GameCube.
6484140	6485140	Right.
6485140	6486140	And it was buried away from a few weeks ago.
6486140	6487140	Yeah.
6487140	6493140	Well, I guess this guy is suddenly getting like exposure all over again, because what's
6493140	6500140	interesting is that on GitHub, he has now released a new NES emulator.
6500140	6505140	And as pointed out in our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, the NES has
6505140	6508140	been emulated pretty perfectly at this point.
6508140	6509140	Right.
6509140	6513140	Emulators have come a long way since Nestle in the late 90s, early aughts.
6513140	6517140	Like the emulators are in a really good place now when it comes to the NES.
6517140	6520140	Here's what makes this one really interesting.
6520140	6526140	It's a transistor emulator, so it emulates down to the transistors.
6526140	6532140	It only runs on OS X right now, which I also think is kind of hardcore, but that's that's
6532140	6533140	what they're doing.
6533140	6536140	And that would be, by the way, OS X.
6536140	6537140	Sorry.
6538140	6546140	But they're saying also it's efforts involved with Visual 2 CO2 and Visual 2 AOC3.
6546140	6550140	Actually, something bothers me because we're technically not on OS X anymore.
6550140	6552140	We're like on OS 12.
6552140	6557140	I assumed that was the other old ass operating system, not Mac.
6557140	6559140	I thought it was the actual OS.
6559140	6560140	What did they call that?
6560140	6562140	I thought it was called OS X.
6562140	6564140	No, it was Mac OS X.
6564140	6565140	No, no, no.
6565140	6566140	I'm not talking about a Mac system.
6566140	6567140	I'm talking about a...
6567140	6570140	Well, I don't think it's Linux.
6570140	6573140	Am I going crazy?
6573140	6574140	Yeah.
6574140	6577140	No, it's OS X, Mac OS X.
6577140	6578140	Okay.
6578140	6581140	I thought there was something.
6581140	6583140	My brain is mixing it up with something else.
6583140	6584140	But okay.
6584140	6585140	Yeah.
6585140	6589140	So for whatever reason, that is the platform it's running on now.
6589140	6592140	It must be what he has access to, or maybe he just has a really...
6592140	6594140	Was I thinking of OS X?
6594140	6595140	I guess I was.
6595140	6596140	I was thinking of OS 2.
6596140	6597140	You might have been thinking of OS 2.
6597140	6598140	I was thinking of OS 2.
6598140	6599140	I sure was.
6599140	6601140	And I was like, damn, that's hardcore.
6601140	6602140	Okay.
6602140	6603140	There we go.
6603140	6604140	That is it.
6604140	6605140	It's OS 2 I was thinking of.
6605140	6608140	I think the last OS X was two years ago.
6608140	6609140	Okay.
6609140	6613140	So anyway, it's running at the transistor level, which is pretty wild.
6613140	6616140	And yeah, you could check that out if you want.
6616140	6621140	And some folks in a Reddit thread about this are pointing out, transistor level emulation,
6621140	6626140	that is like 100% software emulation without emulating quantum effects.
6626140	6627140	It's almost perfect.
6627140	6631140	Of course, it takes more system resources, but you want to talk about perfect emulation.
6631140	6632140	There you go.
6632140	6635140	So this is still probably early on, but it's interesting.
6635140	6636140	He put it on GitHub.
6636140	6639140	So who knows what we're going to see come from this.
6639140	6641140	It's very exciting.
6641140	6650140	So just when we thought NES emulation was perfect, it's going to get more perfect.
6651140	6652140	All right.
6652140	6656140	Anyhow, that is the last story that we had on the agenda tonight.
6656140	6659140	But there's always what you guys have to talk about.
6659140	6660140	The listener round table.
6660140	6662140	If you guys want to, you can try to call.
6662140	6667140	I'll try to make that happen over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6667140	6669140	And then of course we have our mailbag.
6669140	6671140	I don't know if we've gotten anything in the past two weeks.
6671140	6672140	I have to check with...
6672140	6673140	No.
6673140	6674140	We got spam.
6674140	6675140	I deleted it.
6675140	6677140	I have a last minute story.
6677140	6678140	I think some of it was in Dutch.
6678140	6679140	We'll get to that.
6679140	6684140	But participate at orangesontrader.com if you want to send us emails for a future week.
6684140	6687140	Usually when we don't get emails, we talk about Drag Race.
6687140	6691140	But the only thing I have to say that's Drag Race related is tangina heels.
6691140	6693140	End of sentence.
6693140	6694140	All right.
6694140	6697140	The icon, the legend, and the moment.
6697140	6699140	Loki, you had a last minute story.
6699140	6700140	Why don't we get to that?
6700140	6704140	So Konami, being the geniuses that they are...
6704140	6705140	Oh, shit.
6705140	6709140	They forgot to renew the domain for silenthill.com.
6709140	6712140	And it got snatched up by somebody else.
6712140	6718140	And now if you go to silenthill.com, there is a screenshot of a tweet from Masahiro Ito
6718140	6722140	saying, I wish I hadn't decided effing Pyramid Ed.
6722140	6723140	Wow.
6723140	6724140	That's it.
6724140	6726140	That is beautiful.
6726140	6727140	That is...
6727140	6729140	I'm putting this on my Twitter right now.
6729140	6732140	That is something else.
6732140	6733140	Huh.
6734140	6736140	Are they going to hold it ransom or something?
6736140	6740140	Or is it just like a fuck Konami type of thing or that sort of situation?
6740140	6741140	I don't know.
6741140	6743140	Apparently they did the same thing in 2019 too.
6743140	6749140	They let it lapse for a second and forgot to renew it.
6749140	6756140	Because there's also a screenshot of a tweet from some guy named Bob Vids on Twitter.
6756140	6758140	It says, so silenthill.com domain is available.
6758140	6761140	And that was from December 6, 2019.
6761140	6763140	That's fricking hilarious.
6763140	6764140	Yeah.
6764140	6765140	All right.
6765140	6767140	No Konami.
6767140	6769140	Oh boy.
6769140	6775140	So anything else we want to talk about here before we move to wrap up tonight?
6775140	6776140	I feel like it's early.
6776140	6778140	We haven't even really been on air two hours, but...
6778140	6779140	It is.
6779140	6782140	Like I'm normally...
6782140	6783140	Wow.
6783140	6784140	I know, right?
6784140	6786140	We could touch on some of the other headlines from last week.
6786140	6787140	Let me go...
6787140	6789140	Yeah, what happened?
6789140	6790140	There was some other stuff too.
6790140	6791140	We can...
6791140	6792140	Unless you already have it up, Loki.
6792140	6793140	I'll pull up the...
6793140	6794140	I'm working on it.
6794140	6795140	Behind the scenes.
6795140	6799140	I don't know why y'all posted stories because you knew there wasn't a show last week, but
6799140	6800140	both of you...
6800140	6801140	I forgot.
6801140	6802140	I didn't.
6802140	6803140	It's a force of habit.
6803140	6804140	Oh no, I know you did.
6804140	6805140	I'm sorry.
6805140	6806140	I meant in the thread there was that.
6806140	6808140	Which I don't have access to anymore.
6808140	6810140	No, it's a force of habit.
6810140	6811140	So that's why I did it.
6811140	6812140	No, it's all good.
6812140	6813140	It's fine.
6813140	6814140	I'm not actually...
6814140	6816140	Yeah, I can cover some of the stuff that was in there.
6816140	6817140	I do have it up.
6817140	6818140	I do have it up.
6819140	6824140	Let's see, the first season of Chocobo GP is going to be free for full game players
6824140	6825140	and has Cloud and Squall in it.
6825140	6829140	I'm still interested in Chocobo GP, but the whole season thing and some of that free to
6829140	6832140	play stuff is really worrying.
6832140	6835140	Puzzle and Dragons came out for Nintendo Switch.
6835140	6836140	That's cool.
6836140	6837140	I didn't even...
6837140	6838140	That wasn't on my radar.
6838140	6839140	That's pretty rad.
6839140	6843140	Super Metroid got a new save point near the end of the game.
6843140	6844140	What?
6844140	6845140	Thank God.
6845140	6846140	No, it's the...
6846140	6851140	You know how they do that in the Nintendo online app and stuff like that where they
6851140	6856140	have those special modes that you can play that's kind of a save state?
6856140	6857140	It's that.
6857140	6858140	Oh, it's just SP.
6858140	6859140	Okay.
6859140	6860140	I thought...
6860140	6861140	Yeah, the SP.
6861140	6862140	What?
6862140	6863140	They added...
6863140	6864140	Okay, I get it.
6864140	6865140	I get it.
6865140	6866140	Okay, cool.
6866140	6867140	That's still neat.
6867140	6868140	Those SP releases are cute.
6868140	6871140	It allows you to do things that you probably can't do anymore, but you were able to do
6871140	6872140	it as a kid.
6872140	6877640	That's me in that Kid Icarus SP that lets you play the last level that's like a shooter.
6877640	6878640	What the fuck?
6878640	6879640	Out of nowhere.
6879640	6881340	The last level is a shooter level.
6881340	6884660	You can play that now because me trying to actually beat that game in this day and age,
6884660	6886380	very difficult.
6886380	6887380	Very difficult.
6887380	6888380	In this economy?
6888380	6890260	In this economy.
6890260	6893500	It was confirmed that NFTs are not coming out to Final Fantasy XIV.
6893500	6896140	I thought that had come up two weeks ago, but it's in the list here.
6896140	6897420	Oh, Dark Sakura.
6897420	6898420	I know.
6898420	6901060	The reveal of Sadako from Reimu.
6901060	6904380	Did we talk about that two weeks ago?
6904380	6905380	Was the PTB out at that time?
6905380	6906380	I don't know if the PTB was out.
6906380	6910740	The PTB came out that Tuesday, so we got all the talents and all that came out.
6910740	6911740	That's what it was.
6911740	6912740	That's right.
6912740	6916660	We found out the survivor is the child grown up, which is interesting.
6916660	6917660	Yoichi.
6917660	6921060	Yeah, it was not the character or anything there.
6921060	6922860	Which was Reiko's son.
6922860	6924860	Pretty cool.
6924860	6935220	Yeah, I love the aesthetic of Sadako on the test realm.
6935220	6938460	Just the way they did her was great.
6938460	6940460	She seems like she's going to have some issues as a killer.
6940460	6945860	She's definitely not going to be S tier, but I think a niche killer can be really fun.
6945860	6955440	Did you happen to see the render rips that I did?
6955440	6965080	I know I put them out on my Discord, but they were talking about wondering just how short
6965080	6966300	she was.
6966300	6972340	Because right now, the two shortest killers in the game, before Sadako comes out, is Pig
6972340	6973980	and Hag.
6973980	6978980	And Pig is about 5'3".
6978980	6981780	And I'll find a link to it and put it somewhere.
6981780	6988700	But when I ripped the renders and had them all side by side, because I figured out how
6988700	6995260	to do that now, Sadako is about a whole head shorter than Pig.
6995260	6999300	And the only reason that Hag looks short at all is because she's hunched.
6999300	7002980	But when you import her model, she's standing up straight.
7002980	7009420	And we know that that is coming to the full game in early March or something like that,
7009420	7010420	right?
7010420	7011420	8th.
7011420	7016900	All right, Loki, what else did you have that you want to talk about from last week?
7016900	7022340	So there's going to be a new LEGO set for Horizon Forbidden West's Tallneck.
7022340	7024140	They're going to do that, which is kind of cool.
7024140	7030020	They have an official set that will be coming out in May.
7030060	7033820	I believe the 22nd, which is weird, though, because usually they're at the beginning of
7033820	7035620	the month, but OK.
7035620	7036620	So sometime in May.
7036620	7039780	That's going to come out, and it'll be about $80.
7039780	7043140	I am very interested in that.
7043140	7044140	What else?
7044140	7045140	No Man's Sky got another update.
7045140	7046140	It did.
7046140	7047140	It's a combat one.
7047140	7050900	I've watched Alan play a little bit of it.
7050900	7052660	I have not played it myself yet.
7052660	7059940	I've been so busy with eight years of old house collection, unloading it.
7059940	7061980	But it's crazy.
7061980	7064140	If you guys saw that house today, you'd be like, what?
7064140	7067180	You lived here?
7067180	7072860	So I don't know if this is tied in with the new Pokemon games that were just announced,
7072860	7079620	but in Pokemon Legends ArcSis, there was someone that did a free cam in that game, and they
7079620	7085040	were able to find a present day room that was unused, I guess.
7085040	7088980	It's like a bedroom that has a Nintendo Switch and a TV and stuff like that, which is kind
7089020	7094220	of odd in feudal Japan, but it's there.
7094220	7098820	My thought is they were going to use that in the opening sequence to render that in
7098820	7105620	the engine, because if I remember right, you are in the modern times, and then you fall
7105620	7109980	through a void type of thing, and that's how you end up in...
7109980	7115180	It might just be that they put it in a weird spot that they never thought anybody would
7115180	7116180	find.
7116180	7117180	Probably.
7117180	7118180	Yeah.
7118380	7126140	EA executives are blaming Halo and COVID for the fact that Battlefield 2042 didn't do well.
7126140	7131460	Not because the game is completely buggy and pretty much unplayable, but sure.
7131460	7135420	And then, of course, they came out and said, oh, no, no, no, we didn't do that, because
7135420	7139500	it was an internal meeting, comments that were leaked out.
7139500	7145580	Speaking of leaks, Halo Infinite, the Forge mode has leaked out from that, or at least
7145580	7151860	some screenshots, so apparently that's coming, or video, I guess they have video for it,
7151860	7154260	so that's something that's on its way.
7154260	7162620	And then there's a Bioshock film that's in the works at Netflix, so I'm down with that,
7162620	7167460	and then Sonic the Hedgehog is getting a third film and a Knuckles live-action series.
7167460	7170260	Oh, I missed the news about the series.
7170260	7171260	That's interesting.
7171260	7173260	Yeah, on Paramount Plus.
7173260	7180460	Will the series plug into the movie to make a super media experience?
7180460	7181460	I don't know.
7181460	7182460	Have to ask.
7182460	7183460	Maybe.
7183460	7184460	Have to ask.
7184460	7185460	That's it.
7185460	7186460	I had.
7186460	7192100	Mike Defton-Chad is talking about the modern stuff that was found in Pokemon Legends, saying
7192100	7197580	it seems like an unused asset, but it's also rumored to be something for a future DLC.
7197580	7198580	Yeah.
7199580	7205540	Sonic Cinematic Universe, hey, you put that with Detective Pikachu, the upcoming Mario
7205540	7206540	movie.
7206540	7207540	What else do we got?
7207540	7212700	We got a Smash Brothers universe building, is my point, so just, you know, we'll see.
7212700	7218660	And Mike Defton-Chad says Sonic 3 and Knuckles, but separate this time instead of together,
7218660	7222500	which is kind of funny, so very cool.
7222500	7226380	All right, yeah.
7226380	7227900	You guys in chat are funny.
7227900	7231980	All right, well, I guess with that, we're going to wrap up the show.
7231980	7235420	We're a little early, but that's, you know, some weeks the show moves a little faster
7235420	7237060	than others.
7237060	7240100	Thank you guys for listening to our show this week, whether it was on the podcast feed or
7240100	7242780	whether you were here live with us on Twitch.
7242780	7244220	Really appreciate you guys being here.
7244220	7246860	Thank you for bearing with us through some of the sound issues.
7246860	7249260	I have some things to work on this week for sure.
7249260	7253320	Not only do I want to decorate a little more behind me, which might dampen some of the
7253320	7256440	echoing that you're hearing, but it sounds like I might need to switch out the mic, which
7256440	7257440	is a bummer.
7257480	7261040	I really thought this would be a better quality, not a worse one.
7261040	7266480	But I'll play with that and see what we can do behind the scenes about that.
7266480	7269640	And yeah, thank you very much for being here and supporting the show.
7269640	7272120	If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend or two about the show.
7272120	7274960	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
7274960	7280360	need more voices here to put out on air, that's for sure, and would always appreciate that.
7280360	7284400	And yeah, a nice five-star review wherever you found this podcast, whether it's iTunes,
7284400	7289000	Spotify, Google, whatever it is you listen to podcasts on, super appreciate that.
7289000	7294080	And of course, follows and all that good stuff for VOG Network over on Twitch, twitch.tv
7294080	7297520	slash V-O-G network.
7297520	7299920	That is going to do it for tonight.
7299920	7301600	Dark Sakura, I will throw it to you.
7301600	7306040	I imagine you are off to play Debbie Delight post-show or something.
7306040	7307680	You said you were kind of getting burned out on Debbie.
7307680	7309440	Are you going to play something else?
7309440	7312200	I'm still going to do Debbie.
7312200	7317000	Of course, you know, I just need a little bit of prep time because we're done far earlier
7317000	7318600	than I expected to be.
7318600	7319600	So yeah.
7319600	7320600	All right.
7320600	7323600	Well, have a good night.
7323600	7326160	Have fun killing, and we'll see you next week.
7326160	7327160	Bye-bye.
7327160	7328160	Everyone be well.
7328160	7329160	Be kind.
7329160	7330160	All right.
7330160	7333320	Loki, what is your final thought for us tonight?
7333320	7336120	I've got a lot of work to do in Minecraft.
7336120	7339600	I got to do a lot of planning because I've been spending this week doing development
7339600	7343320	of that data pack, which put me behind.
7343320	7346380	So I got to get creative now.
7346380	7353560	My final thought is this has been a very expensive past couple of weeks, but it feels so, so
7353560	7354560	nice to be here.
7354560	7356200	Loki, you've got to come over at some point.
7356200	7357300	Same thing goes for Dark Sakura.
7357300	7361840	We were planning an Ikea trip last week, but then we realized Ikea closed an hour earlier
7361840	7362840	than we thought.
7362840	7366320	So she didn't end up coming out here, but I'm not saying you and I have to go to Ikea,
7366320	7368840	but I do want you to see the new place at some point.
7368840	7369840	Yeah, definitely.
7369840	7370840	It's nice.
7370840	7373000	I'm upstairs now, which is weird.
7373000	7375280	The old house was not upstairs, downstairs.
7375280	7376360	This one is.
7376360	7378880	So it's a little funky, but I like it.
7378880	7383320	And there is, I'm just saying, I'm not saying that I planned this space for us to ever be
7383320	7389480	back in person, but that is a couch behind me and the couch can move to the other wall.
7389480	7391480	There are things that could be done.
7391480	7392480	We'll see.
7392480	7393480	Someday, someday.
7393480	7394480	All right.
7394480	7396320	For now, we're all done here.
7396320	7401680	Thank you all so much for being here and supporting Orange Lounge Radio for 904 weeks or one week,
7401680	7403680	however long you've been with the show.
7403680	7404680	Appreciate you.
7404680	7405780	Happy gaming.
7405780	7407320	Stay safe out there.
7407320	7413560	And again, thoughts for all the Ukrainian people out there and everything the folks
7413560	7415120	in Ukraine are going through.
7415120	7417800	Just, y'all are in my thoughts.
7417800	7418800	Stay safe.
7418800	7419800	Have a great week, everybody.
7419800	7421440	We will see you next time.
