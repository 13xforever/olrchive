0	12640	I'm browsing through the stories that will be discussed tonight and make mental notes
12640	14440	about what I might highlight here.
14440	17680	Towards the end, I read an article that is pretty normal, but while reading it, my smile
17680	19080	gets continually bigger.
19080	23800	The first C64 collection for the Evercade is going to include Summer Games, Winter Games,
23800	27560	Impossible Mission, Jumpman, and more, but those first four delighted me specifically.
27560	31120	I'm so vain, I think this story was written for me, but now it's time for your hosts,
31120	34360	Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give you details about this release and the rest
34360	35360	of the week's gaming news.
35360	37800	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
37800	45120	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
45120	47080	where every gamer has a voice.
47080	55120	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 922 of our
55120	59320	show for tonight, July the 10th of 2022.
59320	64440	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always every week for the past 20 plus years
64440	65880	with my co-hosts.
65880	68840	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
68840	69840	Hi.
69840	70840	Hi.
70840	73160	I can say that now, 20 plus years.
73160	74160	Yes.
74160	77480	How are you doing?
77480	78480	I'm all right.
78480	87120	My office is in a lot of disarray since I am going through my uncountable number of
87120	93240	art supplies and trying to organize them, so it's a mess.
93240	94240	That's all right.
94240	95240	You know what?
95240	96240	It's organized chaos.
96240	98240	No, it's not organized.
98240	99240	But what I-
99240	100800	It absolutely is chaos.
100800	105160	But what I do like is that now you have some lights wrapped around your microphone there,
105160	106160	so you have-
106160	107160	That aren't on.
107160	108800	You're so little flourish there.
108800	109800	There we go.
109800	110800	I was seeing that before the show tonight.
110800	112800	It's messy as hell.
112800	114800	But I know the podcast-
114800	116080	Not bad for an Etsy find.
116080	120280	I know the podcast listeners can't see it, sorry, but we do tape live every Sunday night
120280	124520	at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash
124520	128880	VOG Network, where you can see video and subscribers here at the VOG Network.
128880	131960	Twitch can check out the video on demand throughout the week.
131960	136200	So yeah, but we try to minimize our visual discussions best we can because it is ultimately
136240	139120	a podcast at the end of the day.
139120	143580	And pod culture in our chat while we are taping live says it's a Tron mic.
143580	144920	Sounds like-
144920	145920	That was the idea.
145920	146920	That's the idea.
146920	147920	All right.
147920	148920	I like that.
148920	149920	I like that.
149920	150920	Which by the way, how nice is this?
150920	155640	Great minds think alike as I show you my Flynn's Arcade shirt because Tron-
155640	156640	I'm wearing-
156640	158640	One of your merch.
158640	162560	Yes, the Hook of Shame, my newest shirt.
162560	164240	The Flynn's Arcade is not merch.
164280	168560	I don't even remember where I bought this, but it does, like Tron is like 40 years old
168560	169560	at this point.
169560	170560	So-
170560	172200	Yeah, it actually hit its 40th anniversary.
172200	173200	Yeah.
173200	174200	Yeah.
174200	175200	So that's the thing.
175200	177540	So it's funny that you and I are on the same wavelength of Tron tonight.
177540	179920	So let's check in with Techmaster Loki.
179920	183440	What Tron inspired thing did you bring to the discussion tonight, Loki?
183440	188600	I brought Jared Leto to ruin the franchise.
188600	189600	Send it back.
189600	190600	Send it back.
190600	193200	No, it looks actually based on the game that's playing behind you.
193200	198280	It looks like you brought Arnold Schwarzenegger to wreck the franchise with, now I know that
198280	200240	one, T2, the arcade game.
200240	201300	Heck yeah.
201300	203280	What made you think of T2 tonight?
203280	206860	Because there's a new Terminator game that's coming.
206860	207860	Is there a new one?
207860	208860	Yeah.
208860	209860	Oh.
209860	210860	There's a new one.
210860	212480	Like a shoot-em-up like the old, like that one?
212480	213640	It's a survival game.
213640	220720	I don't know if it's a shoot-em-up, but I mean, this one's my favorite in the arcade.
220720	224760	You have a few people in chat speaking up, as shown here, Matt says T2 arcade was a massive
224760	225760	token eater.
225760	228600	That stupid truck protection stage sucked.
228600	233980	Questmaster says T2 arcade was great and also knows little known about it, this new Terminator
233980	236160	survival game, but it's planned.
236160	241560	I also, you know, those T2, you know, these arcade one-ups, which, you know, I have not
241560	245560	to be a shill for them, but the reality is you can see one behind me here as we broadcast
245560	249560	live on Twitch, because I have a limited edition BurgerTime, although I don't know how limited
249560	252660	it is because I think they're still on sale on the website, but I digress.
252660	254480	They also have a Terminator 2 one.
254480	260040	It's expensive because it's not the same, though, because they made it a light gun game
260040	263880	and the Terminator 2 game was not a light gun game.
263880	268760	It had like an Uzi that I think is just operating like a joystick that you would move around
268760	274940	and aim with, but it wasn't a light gun game from my memory, at least could be wrong, but
274940	278680	I'm pretty sure it wasn't.
278680	283760	But yeah, I remember I had that game on PC, like back in the day, bought a boxed copy
283760	286160	of it to play on PC and that was fun.
286160	288920	They had a version of it on like Super Nintendo, didn't they?
288920	292480	I guess you had to use the controller to move the crosshair.
292480	294480	I think they did, yeah.
294480	295480	Yeah.
295480	296480	So, all right.
296480	300240	All right, well, we're going to get into some news tonight and we'll talk about our gaming
300240	304760	weeks as well, and this is a pretty interesting place to start.
304760	308360	I was a little surprised to hear this this week.
308360	309360	Let's get into it.
309360	312480	Loki, what is the big headline of the week tonight?
312480	314240	It's coming back, baby.
314240	316480	E3, you know, you've been waiting for it.
316480	320560	Well, now they're going to bring it to its physical form.
320560	325120	Of course, this isn't even my final form.
325120	332900	It's going to be New Planner, so they're going to have the folks behind the PAX conventions
332900	335000	and New York Comic Con.
335000	340800	Repop are going to be organizing it and it's supposed to be coming back in 2023, although
340800	346560	as you probably can guess, it's probably going to be less like E3 and I think more like the
346560	350320	E4ALL that they did.
350320	351320	So we'll see.
351320	354280	Yeah, I don't know.
354280	356440	I don't think it needs to come back.
356440	361880	It's interesting that you compare it to E4ALL and not PAX, who Repop also is probably best
361880	366400	known for running, at least in gamer circles, because they took that over from the actual
366400	368360	Penny Arcade team years ago.
368360	369360	Yeah.
369360	370360	Yeah.
370360	374360	E4ALL is kind of like what I remember what they did with E3, where it was we're opening
374360	376600	to the public and all that kind of stuff.
376600	381040	But yeah, it's just kind of, I don't know.
381040	383840	I don't think it needs to exist.
383840	388720	Well, it's it's I'm going to say this as much as I've been critical of E3 and I've been
388720	390400	very critical of E3.
390400	395560	And that's mostly how the ESA really mishandled it in the last several years, not just because
395560	396560	of the pandemic.
396560	405560	I'm not going to fault the ESA for the pandemic canceling E3 for, you know, 2020 and 2021.
405560	408840	I feel like they probably could have done a little something something this year, even
408840	410320	if in limited capacity.
410320	415120	But OK, so, yeah, I mean, COVID isn't exactly gone, so I can see why they've shied away
415120	417440	from it this year as well.
417440	425320	But I have to admit with this year and there not being an E3, it does feel off like this
425320	427440	whole summer game fest and whatever.
427440	428880	That's not the same thing.
428880	434120	You know, and I think it's because there isn't that tent pole that everybody is making their
434120	435440	announcements around.
435440	440200	You don't have that singular week where you can expect Sony makes announcements, Microsoft
440200	443160	makes announcements, Nintendo makes announcements.
443160	445160	Microsoft is the only one that made announcements.
445160	450340	They did a fine job, but it it was just kind of that was it was just announcements and
450340	452960	it does it does feel like something's missing.
452960	458760	I mean, yeah, but like, I don't know how keen they're going to be to want to spend the millions
458760	463480	on a booth and stuff when they're probably finding similar, if not better success with
463480	464620	these digital events.
464620	468240	It's like, what's really going to convince them to come back?
468240	470200	And like, I just don't see that happening.
470200	474120	Yeah, they may do it around the same time like they did this year, like with the Microsoft
474120	476760	Bethesda stuff.
476760	482000	I just don't really see it coming back to being the E3 we once remembered where it's
482000	486400	like all of like these big announcements and everything around that time.
486400	490260	But like, I think a lot of these companies are just going to be kind of hold them back
490260	491260	on their stuff.
491260	492600	You may have like demos and stuff.
492600	496600	I don't think it's going to be anything different than you see, like a PAX or Comic Con or anything
496600	497600	like that.
497600	502000	I don't think it's going to be this major event unless the ESA is willing to put the
502000	508240	money where their mouth is and in partnership with Read Pop, throw a lot of money at a company
508240	509240	like Nintendo.
509240	514280	And honestly, I'm going to be quite honest, Nintendo is the only one they need on board.
514280	516240	They can even get by without the other two.
516240	519360	I think Microsoft will just kind of do it because they tend to do these things.
519360	522240	But the only one they really need is Nintendo.
522240	526520	And if Nintendo, I mean, come on, look at any other E3 and look at like where the mad
526520	528640	rush in that line always goes.
528640	530060	Like I'm just I'm telling it like it is.
530060	532460	And you I love all the platforms.
532460	533460	I love PlayStation.
533460	534940	I love Microsoft.
534940	539900	There's something about Nintendo and the way that it speaks to the gamer population and
539900	543580	the kid in us or whatever, that people always rush their booth first.
543580	548100	So the only people they really, really need to get on board with this is Nintendo and
548100	551260	their show will be fine.
551260	556680	It you know, I and here's the thing, I don't want to speak too positively of this because
556680	564400	the reality is E3, if it's coming back, it's and I saw this name during Bobby show.
564400	565600	This is completely appropriate.
565600	566840	It's zombie three.
566840	571080	It is not going to be the same E3 that you knew 20 years ago.
571080	576720	Now granted, for better and for worse, because we know there were a lot of issues with E3
576720	578120	back in the day.
578120	581780	But at the end of the day, E3 was a trade show, right?
581780	587260	It was for people in the industry, whether you like it or not, to be able to network
587260	592580	to be able to, you know, get advances of what was going to be coming out through the rest
592580	595820	of the years that people that were, you know, writing articles without advance magazines
595820	600940	and so forth, got a sneak peek at that for retailers to get an idea what you know, campaigns
600940	604580	they're going to want to run to try to push, you know, these things towards the end of
604580	605580	the year.
605580	607540	This was a trade event.
607540	613720	Now unless we are corrected otherwise, and I doubt it, depending or based on who this
613720	618220	new partner is in this, E3 is not a trade show anymore.
618220	626100	E3 is a fan convention, which congratulations gamers, you won.
626100	632340	You're going to get you're finally going to get what you always wanted a public E3 congratulations.
632340	633340	You got it.
633980	634980	But guess what?
634980	639060	It's not going to be as good as the E3 that existed back in the day.
639060	641060	And it's not me being an elitist.
641060	643420	That's just me being factual.
643420	645300	And it gives me even less interesting going.
645300	648340	Yeah, it's well, and it's because the internet is a thing.
648340	654860	And it's because you're going to have companies that are less likely to put out their pre-builds
654860	662700	and early access demos in front of the public, because the public can be a bunch of bitches.
663700	669420	Load Twitter during any public gaming event, and you can see how the public can be very
669420	671900	unkind to games.
671900	672900	So if...
672900	675660	The public is just unkind to begin with.
675660	677700	I don't know what they're thinking.
677700	678860	That's true.
678860	685480	They're, they're going, they're going to only show you games that will be out that summer.
685480	691380	So like, let's, let's say read pop E3 was happening this year.
691380	695700	Bayonetta would go, and the game that they would be showing off that would have the long
695700	701280	line, Splatoon 3, which is out in what, two months, if that?
701280	702660	That's the big game they would show.
702660	705520	They would not show you Bayonetta 3.
705520	709740	They would not show, they certainly as fuck are not going to show you Breath of the Wild
709740	710740	2.
710740	713380	They might, but they might have a trailer on the big screen.
713380	716980	We'll give it, maybe, maybe, maybe a read pop E3 would have given us a new trailer on
716980	717980	the big screen.
717980	720580	You sure as fuck wouldn't play that on the show floor right now.
720660	722460	Absolutely not.
722460	725500	So that's, that's it.
725500	727460	And our chat, of course, is lighting up.
727460	732500	Sj100matt in chat says, I guess read pop does have the connections to try to sway these
732500	736540	companies to come in, but it really doesn't seem like these companies are willing to sway
736540	739060	from doing their own direct style model.
739060	740840	I'm going to stand by what I said.
740840	743420	They only need one company to agree to it.
743420	747140	If they get the one company on board, E3 will be all right.
747140	749700	E3 might be a decent fan show.
749700	754600	Now I have my own issues with read pop and why I don't participate with PAX East anymore.
754600	758580	I don't know how much of that old dirt I want to dig up because it is old dirt.
758580	763540	It dates all the way back to PAX East a long time ago.
763540	767900	But needless to say, there's a reason, PAX burned their bridge with me.
767900	769660	I didn't burn my bridge with PAX.
769660	771700	PAX burned their bridge with me.
771700	776120	So I, I'm, there's a reason why I've never gone back.
776120	779960	And I'm not exactly excited to go to this new E3.
779960	781720	But I'm certainly curious.
781720	784160	I realize the potential that's there.
784160	787600	I realize there is a certain type of weight behind the name.
787600	793640	I realize there is a nostalgia and something does feel missing this year.
793640	797920	I'm just not sure this is going to fix all the problems.
797920	802600	As Joan Hunter-Matt says, the new E3 with carnival rides, figuratively three hour long
802600	807080	signs, merch tables, and covered by G4.
807080	808820	You better believe they're going to be there.
808820	809820	Of course.
809820	813800	And they'll, they'll probably have celebs in the gaming industry available at tables
813800	815640	to sign things.
815640	821440	That's how, you know, it's, if anybody is selling an autograph at E3, I'm telling you
821440	825380	that is not the E3 that it used to be.
825380	829480	Bobby Black Wolf, of course, with an analogy that has been covered before, but it is, it
829480	830480	is great.
830960	836520	Ten years ago, I said that PAX was what people who never went to E3 thought E3 was like.
836520	841400	Now, E3 will be what people who never went to E3 thought E3 was like.
841400	842400	Sure.
842400	844200	I, okay, fine.
844200	845200	I don't mind.
845200	846680	I don't, I'll, I'll drudge up the dirt.
846680	847680	Why not?
847680	848680	Bobby Black Wolf in chat.
848680	849680	I'll spill the tea in chat.
849680	850680	Fine.
850680	851680	I'll read it.
851680	855000	Rob and I were invited to PAX East to be on a panel about gaming podcasts.
855000	857280	The panel was cut at the last minute for the schedule.
857280	859240	We had already bought flights and hotels.
859240	861520	We applied as media and were denied.
861520	865960	They wanted us to be on a panel to speak about gaming media, but ultimately decided we were
865960	868960	not gaming media.
868960	873320	Unprofessionalism, it's too much.
873320	880320	Anyway, Questbuster in chat says, in before another story of a stolen demo at E3 shows
880320	881320	up.
881320	882320	Yeah.
882320	883320	Yeah.
883320	884840	Better, better keep those under lock and key.
884840	885840	Oh yeah.
885840	889920	E3 100 Matt says, Oh, I forgot NFTs and the blockchain will be there.
889920	890920	Yeah.
890920	895080	Um, by the way, Bobby, the one part you left out that's important in that story is that
895080	898480	the public tickets had already been sold.
898480	902680	When we asked about trying to get a public ticket, we were told there was nothing they
902680	903680	could do.
903680	908260	If we did not have a listener who had happened to buy extra tickets, we would have flown
908260	910360	out there for literally nothing.
910360	913500	And then I would really be pissed.
913500	917400	At least I was able to record a podcast on the show floor with some friends.
917400	923060	So I feel like I got something done, but yeah, that was some, anyway, now, you know, if you
923060	930060	didn't know now, you know, so, um, and that's why I'm likely not going to be going to the
930060	931060	new E3 either.
931060	932540	It's going to take a lot to convince me.
932540	935220	I should waste my time with the new E3.
935220	942380	Now granted, and I've been saying this on Twitter and I do believe this, but even after
942420	947620	telling you that story via Bobby, even after all that, I think this is better than nothing.
947620	952540	And it's, it's going to be in a better place than where the ESA had it.
952540	954100	The bar was pretty low.
954100	959940	At least if you go, your information should not be stolen and published online, at least
959940	964660	by a company who claims to represent the electronic entertainment industry.
964660	965660	At least there's that.
965660	967300	They ever do anything with that?
967300	970820	No, they swept it, just hoped it would disappear.
970820	976060	And of course, because the gaming media does not have a great attention span and is not
976060	981980	great on follow-up, uh, it disappeared, but no, nothing ever came of that.
981980	989580	So that's that, uh, anyway, um, so I don't know, um, dark Sakura, I, I w I want to go
989580	993500	back to you cause you've been chiming in that you're not very, you're like, whatever with
993500	995580	this E3, can you elaborate on your thoughts?
995580	999540	Like what, what makes you go hard pass on this E3?
1000540	1006060	It's the fact that I haven't cared about E3 in years, really.
1006060	1012940	I just don't have anything in me to give it any attention, especially if it's going to
1012940	1015600	be just another con.
1015600	1020340	I could go to a smaller gaming convention and have a lot more fun than I would at a
1020340	1023220	big corporate stick up the ass thing like this.
1023220	1026380	That's why I stopped going to Anime Expo.
1026380	1030540	That's why I will still sometimes go to Fanime, but even Fanime has kind of turned into something
1030540	1031680	like that.
1031680	1034440	You know, I don't like going to big cons anymore.
1034440	1036620	I don't like the over-commercialization.
1036620	1042780	I go to see the, the, well, in the past I would go see the anime and see the cosplay.
1042780	1047620	And for a game con, I would go to see the games.
1047620	1053700	That's why I liked old E3, even though it was, you know, all swag and booth babes and
1053700	1058340	shit and sometimes you would get free balls out of the deal, the soda, not somebody's
1058340	1059340	balls.
1059340	1064860	It was also the only place I ever got diet balls, it was so weird.
1064860	1067380	But back, back to my point, though, I could go...
1067380	1069420	For those who are watching their ball intake.
1069420	1070420	Yes.
1070420	1078740	But at any, at any rate, it was one place I could go and see the games, see the prototypes,
1078740	1083320	see what was new, talk to people in the industry, get ideas.
1083320	1092760	You know, honestly, going to the parties for GDC were a lot more like old E3 to me.
1092760	1103440	And I mean, this is why I'm actually considering making GDC my thing because I'm working on...
1103440	1111560	I'm doing a little bit for my web comic, but it's based on a visual novel engine.
1111560	1113800	So...
1113800	1118160	I think, and I know you've also spoken about wanting to go to TwitchCon and...
1118160	1119280	I am going to TwitchCon.
1119280	1120280	I think Twitch...
1120280	1121280	I just need somewhere to stay.
1121280	1126680	I think TwitchCon is going to be great because it's about the community and not about the
1126680	1127680	games necessarily.
1127680	1129880	And a lot of people from the community plan to be there.
1129880	1132400	So that's, that's a big part of it.
1132400	1135080	I know we're having a big Debbie party.
1135080	1139480	But you, for me, you hit the nail on the head when you talked about how they're smaller
1139480	1145720	and less important cons that you get a lot more value out of in attending and a hundred
1145720	1148640	percent that part.
1148640	1151360	So there's that.
1151360	1155920	By the way, Bobby Black Wolf is plugging one of them, Southern Fried Gaming Expo is next
1155920	1160520	weekend, which is a mid-sized con and VOG is sponsoring it out in Atlanta.
1160520	1162320	So check that out if you're in the Atlanta area.
1162320	1169440	Well, there's another thing though, and that's honestly artist alleys, which E3 didn't have.
1170400	1178000	But when you have an artist alley at a big convention versus one at a smaller con, the
1178000	1184440	artists from, in my, in my experience, get more out of the smaller cons.
1184440	1189280	They have to pay less for their places and the big corporate ones are trying to milk
1189280	1192520	them less, you know?
1192520	1195680	So there's also that to me.
1195680	1200800	That gives me a chance to actually some more, especially for a gaming convention, I've been
1200800	1211160	able to support smaller developers like my friend who's working on Potato Tail.
1211160	1215520	Bonstablo 6 in chat says Blurred Con was this weekend.
1215520	1221520	Next big East Coast con is Otakon in the Walter Reed Convention Center in Washington, D.C.
1221520	1222520	You know.
1222520	1223520	Not interested in that.
1223520	1224520	It's too big.
1225360	1226800	Blurred Con, I bet is awesome.
1226800	1229800	And those cons that are about communities.
1229800	1230800	I really miss...
1230800	1233000	DJ Rama S says F that con.
1233000	1234880	Oh, there must be a story there.
1234880	1235880	All right.
1235880	1237200	I really miss Gamer X.
1237200	1242600	Now, I understand messy things happened, but I miss what it was with the community and
1242600	1243600	everything.
1243600	1248360	And that was a great sized con and everything, you know, that was, I had some really good
1248360	1249360	memories there.
1249360	1252400	So that was very cool.
1252400	1258680	By the way, because Bobby had brought up Southern Fried Gaming Expo, I was curious because,
1258680	1262840	you know, there's we have our own version of that out here, which I think was the inspiration
1262840	1263840	for that.
1263840	1266120	We have California Xtreme and I was looking into it.
1266120	1267260	Is this month that I'm going?
1267260	1268260	It is.
1268260	1269260	It's July 30th.
1269260	1273880	Do you know for the first time, and I can't remember since when, I don't have any plans
1273880	1275320	that weekend already.
1275320	1277040	I don't have a conflicting show.
1277040	1280460	I don't have a conflicting show because the Rocky show got canceled this month.
1280460	1281460	So I...
1281500	1285300	Yeah, I may actually want to go this year.
1285300	1289300	I'm still kind of feeling out the COVID stuff a little bit, but I think, you know, I think
1289300	1290300	it'll be all right.
1290300	1291300	So, yeah.
1291300	1295380	Well, I did Pinagogo and honestly, that was all right.
1295380	1296380	Yeah.
1296380	1301140	Not Pinagogo, but Golden State Pinball Festival.
1301140	1305380	Plus the mass compliance is just, odds are it's going to be a lot better here than it
1305380	1306380	is.
1306380	1310420	I mean, I am going to Dragon Con and I already know, all right, if I don't get COVID by then,
1310420	1316940	it's probably going to be a high risk situation, but I'm just hoping we have the COVID variant
1316940	1320180	shot available by then because I know they're working on finishing that up.
1320180	1321180	So we'll see.
1321180	1322180	Fingers crossed.
1322180	1324780	But yeah, California Extreme, I'd love to go to that if it could work out.
1324780	1326380	So that'd be cool.
1326380	1328780	Well, you need a ride.
1328780	1329780	Yeah.
1329780	1330780	I'll...
1330780	1331780	You can hang with the pinball crew.
1331780	1333780	I'll be in touch.
1333780	1341580	Anyway, so let's see, genuine excitement when we talk about these mid local, more direct
1341580	1346080	type of cons, these big bloated things, I'm over it.
1346080	1347080	Maybe it's just my age.
1347080	1348080	I'm over it.
1348080	1349080	I don't know.
1349080	1354300	Well, it's just, it's a big, like, if you look at E3, like let's just say from our perspective,
1354300	1360300	like to see anything at E3, you have to wait in lines and like with Nintendo and stuff,
1360300	1362180	that's why there is a big rush to the Nintendo booth.
1362180	1364180	It's not because the people are excited about Nintendo stuff.
1364180	1366220	Sure, they're excited about that and everything else.
1366220	1373020	But Nintendo particularly had like three to five hour wait lines to see a game.
1373020	1374060	Like no thanks.
1374060	1378500	I would rather not waste three to five hours of my time to do that when I can just see
1378500	1380380	it in a video in a direct.
1380380	1384720	And there's like my 30 minutes of time that I spent watching those.
1384720	1389500	The worst is when you stand in line and then you realize what you're seeing got pushed
1389500	1392140	on YouTube that same night.
1392140	1393140	That's that.
1393140	1394900	That was the last E3 I went to.
1394900	1396660	And I think I've told that on the story before.
1396660	1401380	That was the moment when I was like, I'm wasting my fucking time.
1401380	1406340	It was just, it's, it's hard to like, even like going there, like it was hard to pay
1406340	1407340	attention.
1407340	1411500	Like if you're just not using the internet at that time and just going to E3 and trying
1411500	1416900	to pick up the information, it's hard to like get everything you're going to miss stuff
1416900	1417900	on there.
1417900	1420500	You're a miss seeing things because you didn't know what was going on because it's just a
1420500	1421980	chaotic mess.
1421980	1426580	I just can't, I can't imagine this is going to be very good.
1426580	1432180	I mean, whatever it, it'll be like E4 all, but like, I don't think people wanted that
1432180	1434140	to come back and it certainly didn't come back.
1434140	1436140	So I don't know.
1436140	1437140	All right.
1437140	1441100	Well, we'll, uh, we'll keep our eye on this new E3.
1441100	1446020	I mean, even though we're all kind of looking at this going meh, I mean, it is relevant
1446020	1451500	if they can get the big names to support the show and get those big announcements again,
1451500	1452540	it's going to be important.
1452540	1456900	So we'll keep our eye on it and see how things develop over the next few months.
1456900	1461400	But in the meantime, we'll focus on this month or this week and talk about our gaming weeks
1461400	1463460	and the types of games that we've been playing.
1463460	1465580	So Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?
1465580	1467760	How was your gaming week?
1467760	1472660	Playing Dead by Daylight and I'm still working on Survivor and indeed I will be playing again
1472660	1475460	with Finara later tonight.
1475460	1483220	Um, Finara has been my meat shield so that I can get, um, my adepts and, you know, get
1483220	1484220	better with the game.
1484220	1488940	And I'm already at gold four, gold four or gold three.
1488940	1495580	I don't remember, but, um, I also, I don't know what it is, but I think because I am
1495580	1501200	a killer main, I have a talent of making friends with the killers, the ones who are in the
1501200	1503760	mood to be friends.
1503760	1510280	Like I had a match where basically Finara and I were the only ones who really made it
1510280	1523160	out okay because we stopped to boop a pig and I've made friends with legions, which
1523160	1526720	you know, lesion players are notorious for being pretty toxic.
1526720	1531600	Um, I've, I've made, and I actually, I played a doctor match.
1531600	1536280	I actually did play a killer match because I wanted to just get the challenge done and
1536280	1540780	ended up just memeing around and met another streamer.
1540780	1541780	That was pretty fun.
1541780	1542780	Yeah.
1542780	1543840	I actually rated them after my stream.
1543840	1549200	So I've been, I've been getting a lot, I like Survivor better, a lot better than I thought
1549200	1550200	I would.
1550200	1554060	Um, cause the first like doing the demo, I hated it.
1554060	1559300	And then when I played with some other friends, I was like racked with nerves the whole time.
1559300	1562480	And the one thing that I do not like is that because I have to use the thumb track ball
1562480	1569980	mouse for having a bad wrist, um, I can't look behind me when I run, which also means
1569980	1575460	that I will not have any problem with them nerfing dead hard cause I don't use it.
1575460	1587940	I am however, not looking forward to adapting, uh, uh, David because no, yeah, however, um,
1587940	1593880	I, you know how if you do a certain generator in certain levels, you get an achievement
1593880	1594880	for it.
1594880	1595880	Yeah.
1595880	1596880	I have one left to go.
1596880	1597880	Oh, that's nice.
1597880	1598880	Which one?
1598880	1599880	I have, I have a Scrotus pen.
1599880	1600880	I mean, Crotus pen.
1600880	1601880	Okay.
1601880	1602880	I call it.
1602880	1603880	I call it Scrotus pen.
1603880	1604880	Okay.
1604880	1605880	Yeah.
1605880	1606880	The, the served ward.
1606880	1608880	I got the, the chapel.
1608880	1609880	Okay.
1609880	1613840	Honestly, if you got RPD, that's the biggest pain in the butt in my opinion.
1613840	1614840	So congrats.
1614840	1615840	Yeah.
1615840	1622100	Um, I got with, uh, Nick and anti vortex and I forgot who else, but they were like, no,
1622100	1623100	you're getting this.
1623100	1626700	I, someone brought the offering and said, you're getting this.
1626700	1627700	And so I got it.
1627700	1628700	Oh, that's fun.
1628700	1629700	Yeah.
1629700	1633180	And, and the, the, the killer ended up, you know, pretty much letting us go anyway.
1633180	1636540	Um, so it was, it was all right.
1636540	1642900	You know, um, and I got, I think I do have almost everyone adept now.
1642960	1647600	I know this is all like dead by daylight stuff that not everyone cares about, but I have
1647600	1653440	Laurie, Ace, Adam, Ash, yeah.
1653440	1654440	And David.
1654440	1656180	Those are the ones I have left.
1656180	1658640	Of course, Nancy and Steve don't count.
1658640	1669640	Um, I also, um, I still couldn't get my final fantasy, uh, six translated uncensored version
1669640	1671580	to play in a battle.
1671580	1673960	Like it'll do everything except do the damn battle.
1673960	1674960	Oh, weird.
1674960	1680560	So, uh, yeah, it's, and I think it's just the patch or, or my copy of it or something.
1680560	1684180	And I, and like I said, I feel absolutely justified playing it through emulation because
1684180	1686040	I own both copies of the game.
1686040	1687040	Yeah.
1687040	1690100	I mean, I have a Japanese cartridge and I have an American cartridge.
1690100	1693780	How many times do you have to own a game before we stop apologizing for emulating?
1693780	1694780	Because it's convenient.
1694780	1697000	I'm saying it because I'm streaming it.
1697000	1698000	No, no, no.
1698000	1699280	I mean, in general, I'm not attacking you.
1699280	1703380	I'm just saying in general, like the community, like, like emulation has to be acceptable
1703380	1704380	at some point.
1704380	1706400	Like, you know, you're just playing the stuff you own.
1706400	1707400	Like I, yeah.
1707400	1708400	Anyway.
1708400	1709400	Yeah.
1709400	1721800	Um, um, but I, um, I suplexed to train on Wednesday and I did the opera last night and
1721800	1724820	I will be playing it again on Wednesday.
1724820	1725820	Nice.
1725820	1731960	So, but tonight is, is Debbie Thursday and Friday is dead by daylight.
1731960	1736980	And I'm actually really gonna try to get through the rest of those depths and try to get back
1736980	1738420	to killer a little bit later.
1738420	1742780	I think the thing that I like best is just that I've been playing with friends.
1742780	1743780	That's cool.
1743780	1746200	I, the life of the killer is a lonely life.
1746200	1750340	I would love to join you tonight, but I have a major, major work thing starting tomorrow.
1750340	1752520	So I got to get to bed on time.
1752520	1753520	So
1754220	1755640	All right.
1755640	1760620	But maybe this just during the week's going to be hard just because yeah, I have a major
1760620	1761620	work thing going on.
1761620	1763220	So it's all right.
1763220	1764220	But if you can, you can.
1764220	1765220	Maybe next Sunday.
1765220	1766220	Yeah.
1766220	1767220	Maybe.
1767220	1768220	It depends how traffic is.
1768220	1770720	Cause I have to commute to another city this week.
1770720	1771720	So yeah.
1771720	1774460	Well, as Dan is fond of saying, real life must intrude.
1774460	1780480	Unfortunately, it is the way it goes, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1780480	1785920	It's been a lot of video editing in Minecraft as usual, like three videos in a week.
1785920	1786920	Right?
1786920	1787920	Yeah.
1787920	1790960	So I had two videos out like last week and then I put one out in the beginning of this
1790960	1791960	week.
1791960	1798800	So, uh, the new bill I did was a guardian XP farm and the bottom of the farm is the
1798800	1802080	giant lantern fish from mega man too.
1802080	1804880	So I think, I think it came out really well.
1804880	1809240	Um, yeah, this next, I saw him come up with what I'm building for.
1809240	1813500	I mean, I have worked on stuff for, with the new frog lights.
1813500	1818760	So that's a thing that's in Minecraft now where do you bring frogs into the nether and
1818760	1825160	you break down magma cubes to the smallest little magma cube, they'll eat them and poop
1825160	1827520	out lights for reasons.
1827520	1828520	I don't know.
1828520	1832860	Um, so I have a farm that does that now and it's way too efficient.
1832860	1839220	So I, I keep cutting back the amount of space that's dedicated to the lights and just what
1839220	1841900	it's a normal magma cube farm.
1841900	1847660	And I have to now cut it down to a quarter because I literally have, Oh gosh, probably
1847660	1850820	20 double chests full of frog lights.
1850820	1855540	That's more than I'll ever need more than the server will ever need for the entire season
1855540	1857540	after like a night.
1857540	1862060	So it'll be, it'll be fun to figure out how I'm going to use those, but I need to come
1862060	1863060	up with some more magma and stuff.
1863060	1866940	I think this time that we have to make a shop to sell some things cause I have a bunch of
1866940	1869740	farms now and I need to probably start doing that.
1869740	1876180	We just went to the, uh, the deep dark and the ancient city today and that kind of didn't
1876180	1884180	go great, but we, we did some fun, like, uh, challenge things where we were basically stripped
1884180	1888300	down to like no armor or anything and we just decided, okay, we're just going to sprint
1888300	1892100	through this thing and see whoever dies the last.
1892100	1893100	And I died the last.
1893100	1896100	So I got, I got 50 diamonds out of that.
1896100	1897100	Congratulations.
1897100	1898100	It was fun.
1898100	1899100	All right.
1899100	1901100	Um, let's see.
1901100	1905780	My gaming week, uh, I also play a little dead by daylight, um, kind of focusing on killer
1905780	1906780	this week.
1906780	1908940	I played a lot of, I'm really trying to get better with Sadako.
1908940	1913900	Um, and, uh, I find my matches just, they swing the pendulum either I get four Ks or
1913900	1914900	I get bullied.
1914900	1917300	Uh, it just was feast or famine.
1917300	1918300	Yeah.
1918300	1919300	It's, it's really just depends.
1919300	1920300	So I'm just trying to get better with her.
1920300	1924500	Uh, just trying to get better with chasing on like L wall T walls is really where I need
1924500	1925500	like the help.
1925500	1927600	Um, I've also been playing plague.
1927600	1930460	I kind of consider plague my other sort of main of the moment.
1930460	1932180	So, um, that's kind of fun.
1932180	1935420	I just like plague because I feel like she breaks the normal survivor meta.
1935420	1937260	Like dead hard doesn't matter with her really.
1937260	1938260	Yeah.
1938260	1940100	So cause you can just puke on them.
1940100	1941100	Exactly.
1941100	1943040	Cause uh, that distance doesn't give you anything.
1943040	1945860	So yeah, you know, I used to be a plague main.
1945860	1948420	I, yeah, it's kind of where you started, wasn't it?
1948420	1956540	I started with Legion and then I was following Otz's, uh, like killer tier, you know, best
1956540	1957540	perk thing.
1957540	1960540	And then I finally realized, you know what, I don't really care about his opinion.
1960540	1962540	I mean, he's great streamer, great person.
1962540	1964020	I don't person's opinion.
1964020	1965020	Yeah.
1965020	1970340	But I did agree that starting off with plague really helped me because learning a hard killer
1970340	1976100	like that made learning pig a cinch.
1976100	1979620	I found that tall characters are harder for me to play than short characters.
1979620	1980620	Yeah.
1980620	1981620	Which is, and isn't that funny?
1981620	1985580	Like plague is very tall and Sudako is very short and that's where I kind of live right
1985580	1986580	now.
1986580	1987580	Sadako is the shortest one.
1987580	1992340	I think that comparatively she's like four, no, she's like right at five foot I want to
1992340	1995700	say or four, four, 10, five foot.
1995700	1997920	And pig is five, three, which is my height.
1997920	2002800	But the best thing ever with Sadako is that when you go to hook somebody and she kind
2002800	2007800	of, you know, she does all psychic powers, when she goes, the hook actually lowers so
2007800	2009840	that she can get them on the hook.
2009840	2013280	The hook actually bends down ever slightly during the whole animation.
2013280	2016320	The hook is like, I will bend to your will mistress.
2016320	2017320	Yes.
2017320	2019000	She's like, damn right, bend to my psychic powers.
2019000	2020240	It's her psychic powers.
2020240	2021860	So yeah.
2021860	2026360	Other games I've been playing, I've been continuing to play Diablo three and apparently there's
2026360	2030800	a group of like, I was reading a story on a website this week about how like there's
2030800	2036100	people that went and played Diablo immortal and then realized when Diablo immortals like
2036100	2038300	money making stuff was kind of BS.
2038300	2041360	They just went back and played Diablo three and were like, Oh, there's a lot of stuff
2041360	2042360	going on here.
2042360	2046020	I'm like, I am one of those people because they actually the latest season, they added
2046020	2050140	a new thing where there's like a whole little bonus room that was kind of fun to play.
2050140	2054200	And I guess the next season they're testing next week and they're, it's adding a new thing
2054200	2055200	too.
2055200	2060040	I kind of thought Diablo was done adding stuff, but they're still adding like little things,
2060080	2065320	which is great because Diablo three doesn't have microtransactions anymore.
2065320	2069080	We all know the real money auction house was a disaster, but that is like eight year old
2069080	2070080	news at this point.
2070080	2071440	That is a way in the past.
2071440	2075520	So this is a, the game's in a good place now and I'm having fun.
2075520	2076920	Alan got back into it too.
2076920	2082640	So I was helping him level his seasonal and then he got help from strangers online.
2082640	2084740	He's like double my paragon level right now.
2084740	2088560	He's like paragon four 70 or something and I'm like 200 maybe.
2088560	2092360	So yeah, it's kind of, kind of fun.
2092360	2097800	And then also continuing my GPS games, I hit level 61 in Pikmin and then I haven't really
2097800	2098800	been playing that.
2098800	2101600	There's a Pokemon event that happened this weekend, but I've only like half been half
2101600	2102600	paying attention.
2102600	2103800	I don't like the battling stuff.
2103800	2106600	I don't really care for the team rocket battles and that stuff.
2106600	2109980	I'll do them if I have to, but I've just kind of been ignoring this event.
2109980	2113520	So but I just want to make sure I catch all the Pokemon.
2113520	2117320	So I got Pansear who's like a regional who's kind of available right now.
2117320	2118320	Yeah.
2118320	2122800	So just try to, try to get the rest of the candy I need to evolve that one and then I'll
2122800	2125040	feel better about where that's at.
2125040	2131680	Otherwise one other games that I've been playing, which is random, but it came out on Xbox game
2131680	2137720	pass, which I also think is random and it's on game pass for PC and Xbox series, but I've
2137720	2142440	been playing on PC DJ Max respect.
2142440	2149280	So V, which is fun and it's funny because I own it on steam too, but remember I got
2149280	2152560	a new computer, so I never installed it on this computer.
2152560	2154320	So I was like, ah, what the hell?
2154320	2158200	I'll install the game pass version to get some achievements, but the only thing that
2158200	2164400	sucks is none of my DLC, cause I don't think the Xbox version has the DLC implemented yet.
2164400	2168200	Whereas the steam version has like classical and some of the stuff I really like.
2168200	2171800	So it's sorry to say, but the steam version is a little bit better.
2171800	2173800	I think still cause it has the DLC available.
2173800	2176880	I don't know if they're planning on adding that to Xbox, but probably won't be on game
2176880	2177880	pass anyway.
2177880	2180000	Uh, it's probably how they kind of hook you in.
2180000	2185640	So, um, Mike depth and chat says DJ max respect V on Xbox is pretty much the same as the PC
2185640	2188280	version for better and for worse.
2188280	2189280	Yeah.
2189280	2194240	So it's, it's pretty much the same thing just in the windows store and a series X, but yes,
2194240	2198000	I've been getting some achievements there and it's, it's kind of scratching the 2d X
2198000	2205080	itch because do you remember how round one was supposed to open here in, um, Roseville
2205080	2206360	in June?
2206360	2208680	Yeah, we were lied to.
2208680	2212960	So apparently according to Reddit and somebody who called now it's like late August, they've
2212960	2219800	been pushing that lied to, but they've been pushing that back every single time.
2219800	2225080	But I mean, I understand the first time cause of COVID, but they had, was it cause I'm in,
2225080	2230160	um, I was in the old Sean against group now it's like sack gamers or something like that.
2230160	2235220	And they had, someone had posted a picture from today, I think where like the game machines
2235220	2240080	are on, like some of them are on, I don't know what they're doing right now, but I mean,
2240080	2242480	it should be opening and I hope pretty soon.
2242480	2243480	Hmm.
2243480	2244960	Well, we'll see.
2244960	2249080	It wasn't, I went by the mall last week and it still wasn't open, but, and I'm sure when
2249080	2250920	it opens, we'll hear everything.
2250920	2254680	Does that, is that the same group that had all the games that strikes in Rockland?
2254680	2255680	Are they all still there?
2255680	2257440	I haven't been to strikes since the pandemic.
2257440	2261620	Yeah, they had stuff there and I think at the drive-in as well, and then of course that
2261620	2262620	burned down.
2262620	2265060	Um, but yeah, I think they had them at strikes.
2265060	2266560	I think that stuff's still there.
2266560	2267560	Interesting.
2267560	2269240	I just haven't been over there since the pandemic started.
2269240	2270240	So just curious.
2270240	2271240	All right.
2271240	2273600	Um, Oh, that's fine.
2273600	2274600	I didn't realize this.
2274600	2279200	Mike Defton chat says I'm playing the Xbox version of DJ Max respect and the freaking
2279200	2282940	game still tells you press F 12 for X.
2283100	2284580	And I'm like, I'm on an Xbox.
2284580	2285580	God damn it.
2285580	2288720	I, that's this type of stuff I thought they're supposed to find in certification.
2288720	2290820	That's what the cert process is supposed to find.
2290820	2292140	So that one must've got missed.
2292140	2293140	That's interesting.
2293140	2294140	So, Hmm.
2294140	2295140	All right.
2295140	2297840	Um, that's it for our gaming weeks.
2297840	2302180	Let's get into some more gaming news and what else is going on around the industry.
2302180	2305700	There's been, there's been some stories this week, so we'll start with Loki and a franchise
2305700	2307260	near and dear to his heart.
2307260	2308260	Yeah.
2308260	2310220	What used to be guaranteed.
2310220	2312260	It's still near and dear to my heart.
2312260	2313980	Um, it's so dear to your heart.
2313980	2315580	It just keeps breaking it.
2315580	2316580	Yeah.
2316580	2320100	Oh, so Rockstar basically confirmed a lot of things that we kind of already assumed
2320100	2322340	with their actions.
2322340	2326100	I mean, that's just kind of the way they've been treating things.
2326100	2332780	So they've confirmed that, um, major red dead online or red dead online support is done.
2332780	2335380	I mean, let's be honest, it's been done for months already.
2335380	2340180	They haven't really supported it at all because their cash cow grand theft auto online is
2340180	2344420	been making a ton of money and that's where they're putting their effort.
2344420	2348500	So they said, you know, over the past few years, we've steadily moving towards development
2348500	2353380	resources towards the entry of the next entry in the grand theft auto series.
2353380	2358660	Understanding that, um, more than ever, the need to exceed players expectations for this
2358660	2361940	next century can be the best as possibly can be.
2361940	2366420	Um, and as a result, we are in the process of making some changes in how we support red
2366420	2367420	dead online.
2367660	2372780	Let's be honest, like they haven't like provided updates to red dead online for like a long
2372780	2377300	time and it's certainly not supported the same way as grand theft auto online.
2377300	2380900	So sure, we'll just say that they're doing that.
2380900	2385340	Um, and then of course they're also shelving some other remakes.
2385340	2390780	So this one really is super disappointing for me because I was a huge fan of grand theft
2390780	2391780	auto four.
2391780	2394500	Uh, it's where I played all my modded games and stuff.
2394500	2399980	They were going to do a remaster grand theft auto four and of the original red dead redemption.
2399980	2406940	But they said that, um, allegedly do the insider sources that these are no longer on the table,
2406940	2413660	uh, because of the mess that grand theft auto, um, the trilogy went through.
2413660	2416940	I mean, but are they surprised?
2416940	2422300	I mean, like they didn't put a lot of effort into the trilogy and they're surprised that
2422300	2423620	it like blew up at them.
2423620	2428100	Like, I mean, they're really going to put the same amount of effort and let's have like,
2428100	2432980	I was going to ask if the four remake was in the same boat as the trilogy, it probably
2432980	2434180	would have pissed you off.
2434180	2435180	You wouldn't have been happy.
2435180	2437540	Oh, it would have absolutely pissed me off.
2437540	2441820	But like I still would have liked to see a re oh, I'd like to see a remake of that.
2441820	2446020	It would be nice, but I just, if they're not going to put any effort into it, which I don't
2446020	2450440	understand why they have the resources, they make so many billions of dollars off of grand
2450440	2451440	theft auto.
2451440	2453600	I mean, five has been out forever.
2453600	2457000	I don't understand why they couldn't do that, but all right.
2457000	2462740	I mean, if you really don't want to put the effort behind it, then I guess it's better
2462740	2463740	not to come out.
2463740	2468680	Fifth dream in chat says grand theft auto six will never meet gamers expectations.
2468680	2471920	Do you think the bar is too high for GTA six?
2471920	2474760	Um, yeah, it is.
2474760	2479680	I think it's, it's never going to, I think, I think the problem with GTA six and I don't
2479680	2481360	even play these games as much as you do.
2481360	2485900	And I fully admit that Loki, but I think the problem with GTA six is going to be the pressure
2485900	2490640	to make something that continues the online side of things.
2490640	2493940	Because like you said, that's where they're raking in the billions.
2493940	2495180	That is what's going to happen.
2495180	2500960	So here's what I see with GTA six is like, it'll never single player wise, it's never
2500960	2507500	going to live up to it because it's it going from like four to five, it was just such a
2507500	2512540	massive like the world was so much bigger and so much more in depth and stuff.
2512540	2516540	You just can't, you can't really go much further with it.
2516540	2520980	Like you can't make it even more in depth and larger.
2520980	2525600	I don't know how big of a world they can really make with that kind of detail.
2525600	2526740	It would have been nice.
2526740	2530520	The thought was originally with grand theft auto six that was going to be a different
2530520	2535500	location and that that would somehow tie into grand theft auto online or that grand theft
2535500	2540820	auto online would keep expanding to like, you know, we'd go to Liberty City and we would
2540820	2546100	go to Vice City and then maybe new locations that they'd never come up with and you have
2546100	2548760	it where you that would all kind of interconnect together.
2548760	2554340	But I don't know, I'll still play it.
2554340	2561260	But it's, it's gonna be like micro transaction to hell, you know, for grant, whatever grand
2561260	2567580	theft auto online to is it's going to be just an absolute slog as far as pushing those
2567580	2570740	micro transactions, because that's where they made so much money.
2570740	2574980	I mean, the people have voted with their wallets, so
2574980	2577460	Zen monkey 11 says GTA six will be epic.
2577460	2582420	Rockstar always comes through, you know, let's, let's, let's, it'd be nice to see something.
2582420	2583420	That's all it's been.
2583420	2584420	It's been a while.
2584420	2585420	It's been a while.
2585420	2586420	Yeah.
2586420	2587420	Like, let's put it this way.
2587420	2588420	Like the single player probably is going to be good.
2588420	2594540	Like because Red Dead Redemption two was a great single player experience.
2594540	2599520	I just like I'm still disappointed that five never had any single player DLC like as four
2599520	2605700	had two really great pieces of single player DLC that were, it really fit that game.
2605700	2610820	Like I would love to see something like that, but I don't know.
2610820	2611820	We'll see.
2611820	2617560	SGA 100 Matt in chat says GTA blockchain confirmed.
2617560	2618560	Please know.
2618560	2619560	I don't think so.
2619560	2623100	But like, you're not.
2623100	2624620	Please do not.
2624620	2628700	Let's move on and talk because I don't, I don't know if crypto is treating this company
2628700	2634060	very well, but there's, unfortunately, I think what a lot of us knew was probably gonna happen
2634060	2638540	eventually started to happen over at GameStop and, but, but I mean, I'm going to start off
2638540	2639540	with this.
2639540	2641660	An executive gets laid off.
2641660	2648820	So the chief financial officer of GameStop, Mike Recupero has been fired.
2648820	2651860	And along with that, some mass layoffs.
2651860	2657500	An email that went out from CEO Matt Furlong said that these reductions are to help the
2657500	2664920	company operate more nimbly while they pursue profitability through an intense owner's mentality.
2664920	2666580	I'm not sure totally what that means.
2666580	2671140	I'm assuming it's gaming culture and how you walk into GameStop now and it's like Funko
2671140	2673400	Pops shirt, things like that.
2673400	2676020	It's not just games like it used to be.
2676020	2681180	The first line of the email read, change will be a constant as we evolve our commerce business
2681180	2684660	and launch new products through our blockchain group.
2684660	2685660	Sorry.
2685660	2686660	Sorry.
2686660	2692420	It's so sad to see them like pivoting towards this considering what's going on in the crypto
2692420	2693420	space.
2694260	2696900	I was like, dude, do you not read the internet?
2696900	2697900	Do you not?
2697900	2698900	Do you not have phones?
2698900	2699900	Like what?
2699900	2700900	All right.
2700900	2701900	Yeah.
2701900	2702900	I'm sure.
2702900	2708660	I'm sure you'll be different, but while the layoffs seem to be mostly focused at the headquarters
2708660	2712960	in Texas, it's important to point out that some of the staff at Game Informer, which
2712960	2716860	of course is the magazine that's been around forever from GameStop, I'm surprised that's
2716860	2717860	still around.
2717860	2718860	Yeah.
2718860	2722180	But unfortunately, uh, the, some of that staff was laid off as well.
2722180	2724580	So who knows what that means for the future of the magazine?
2724580	2729740	Um, and that's always sad because, you know, I think a lot of us old timers sit there and
2729740	2733080	go, damn magazines used to be so cool.
2733080	2735140	And then we just, oh, you want to hire us.
2735140	2736580	Another one, another one.
2736580	2739660	I went, I went to a Barnes and Noble the other day.
2739660	2740660	Oh no.
2740660	2742900	And I walked over, I walked over.
2742900	2743900	Yeah.
2743900	2744900	Yeah.
2744900	2745900	They still exist.
2745900	2746900	Uh, they closed super early now.
2746900	2749700	Um, but I went over to, uh, the magazine section.
2749700	2752420	I was like, oh, I'm gonna like for gaming magazines.
2752420	2753420	Yep.
2753420	2754420	They weren't there.
2754420	2758860	They had, I think it may have like a retro magazine or something like that, the one import
2758860	2764240	from Europe, like a retro magazine from Europe, I think it's like, I thought that retro gamer
2764240	2765240	was over.
2765240	2767500	Oh, I used to get that.
2767500	2769700	Maybe it wasn't necessarily a retro gamer.
2769700	2773460	Like a lot of them aren't necessarily magazines like issue magazines.
2773460	2778220	A lot of them will do like, it's a retro gaming spectacular magazine where it like just covers
2778220	2779220	like retro games.
2779740	2781420	And it's like a one-off type thing.
2781420	2782740	So they'll have those.
2782740	2787020	Um, I did find it funny though that 2,600 still has a magazine coming out.
2787020	2788020	That's that's funny.
2788020	2795940	Um, but yeah, no, it was sad to see like no gaming magazines anymore.
2795940	2798100	So it is what it is.
2798100	2799100	Uh, interesting.
2799100	2802980	Bobby is talking about, uh, his trip to Minneapolis for summer games done quick and some of the
2802980	2804260	sightseeing around there.
2804260	2808780	Bobby in our chat says, when I visited the museum of consumerism in Minneapolis, better
2808820	2816540	known as the mall of America, uh, the GameStop was actually called GameStop pop culture.
2816540	2825780	So is that pop culture as in Funko pop culture, when's the, when's the dam going to burst
2825780	2826780	on those things?
2826780	2830540	Like, I feel like those things are everywhere and they're not going, you know, it's the
2830540	2831860	beanie babies that won't go away.
2831860	2832860	I guess so.
2832860	2835860	And look, I, before you all labeled me a hater, I'm not a hater.
2835860	2839140	Look, I have pop, I'm not going to reach up there, but I have pop figures that are
2839140	2840140	way up here.
2840140	2845260	I have my Mass Effect Andromeda ones up here, uh, uh, Sarah Ryder and Liam Costa are up
2845260	2846260	there.
2846260	2853140	Um, but like, so I, yeah, I do have some, but I, I still can't, my God, they're everywhere,
2853140	2854140	everywhere.
2854140	2856980	And actually, do you know what's in my office?
2856980	2861600	Do you know what's way cooler than any Funko pop I own?
2861600	2866400	The Spice Girls Legos I just got on my last trip to the Galleria last week.
2866400	2867400	Yeah, that's right.
2867400	2868400	I forgot those are coming out.
2868400	2870660	The Spice Girls Legos.
2870660	2874760	I I'm going to have to do this next week is, is too much for me at work to do it, but I
2874760	2878200	think maybe in two weeks I'll do a creative stream and I'll build those on stream.
2878200	2880480	I think that'll be fun.
2880480	2884400	So I'll tell you what I want, whatever they want.
2884400	2885760	It's more Spice Girls Legos.
2885760	2886760	That's for sure.
2886760	2890200	Actually, there's so many cool like Lego stuff now.
2890200	2896200	Like damn, like, like between the, cause when I was in the store, um, they had a Sonic
2896200	2897400	stuff.
2897400	2898800	They had all the Mario stuff.
2898800	2901040	I know there's a story coming up later on that Mario stuff.
2901040	2903480	I won't spoil it, but I think y'all know what I'm talking about.
2903480	2904480	There's that.
2904480	2907000	Like there's a lot of cool ass Lego stuff right now.
2907000	2912680	They keep, I keep seeing the question block and I'm like, yeah, it's so expensive.
2912680	2913980	I don't, I don't need it.
2913980	2916360	And I also see, I keep seeing the Queer Eye set.
2916360	2918000	I just don't like the television.
2918000	2919000	Oh yeah.
2919000	2920000	Queer Eye set.
2920000	2921000	It's um, they have that.
2921000	2922360	They have, they have a bunch of like TV shows.
2922360	2929880	They have Seinfeld, Friends, they had two Friends sets, uh, Queer Eye and well, way
2929880	2936300	back they had, uh, the big bang, big bang theory, but, um, yeah, there's a lot of sets
2936300	2939800	or I look every week, but like all the time I'm like, nope, nope.
2939800	2940800	I don't need that.
2940800	2944440	We never got our drag race Lego set even though it got the voting thing.
2944440	2947080	But anyway, yeah, it's licensing.
2947080	2949840	Well, they need to figure it out cause we need drag race.
2949840	2952880	Like, come on, we need the work room in a Lego set.
2952880	2954160	Come on.
2954160	2955160	They have a new one though.
2955160	2962660	That not Lego necessarily, but uh, Mega constructs has a new Pikachu that actually is, it has
2962660	2965360	a crank and it does the animation of running.
2965360	2968860	I was just saying, are they the Lego clone that have the Pokemon license?
2968860	2969860	Because we were all, they are.
2969860	2970860	Yeah.
2970860	2976380	I haven't, I hadn't been to the mall in a while and there's a lot of like, like Japanese
2976380	2980820	import type of stores now between like Daiso, Miniso and like other, like there were at
2980820	2984420	least two or three other like collectible stores like that, but they had a ton of like
2984420	2985420	Pokemon really.
2985420	2986420	I sent Shane a picture.
2986420	2987900	I was like, did you know these exist?
2987900	2992820	So I need to go to Miniso cause I've actually gotten really good storage saver stuff from
2992820	2993820	their site online.
2993820	2994820	Oh yeah.
2994820	2996460	Mega constructs also had Halo.
2996460	2997700	They also had destiny.
2997700	3000740	In fact, I still have a destiny.
3000740	3002620	It's like, I don't know what they call them.
3002620	3009620	I know in Lego terms, it's the, um, Oh gosh, it's the block heads.
3009620	3011640	It's like blocks on the, I don't know.
3011640	3016480	It's a little like kind of the Funko pop version of Lego characters.
3016480	3017480	I don't remember.
3017480	3018480	They call brickheads.
3018480	3019480	That's right.
3019480	3024260	And um, so whatever the mega constructs equivalent of that would be for destiny, I have one of
3024260	3025260	those.
3025260	3027380	Um, it was, these were all stuff.
3027380	3028380	I got it.
3028380	3038740	Um, but yeah, they have a lot of unique licenses.
3038740	3040420	Hot Wheels is one that they have right now.
3040420	3045020	They have like hot, big old Hot Wheels cars you can make, um, I don't know.
3045020	3046020	Very exciting stuff.
3046020	3047020	Yeah.
3047020	3051280	Anyway, my advice to GameStop, uh, more spice girls, less crypto, but as long as you keep
3051280	3058100	marching to this crypto thing, like rip, honestly, so, all right, moving on, uh, things to look
3058140	3062140	forward to Dark Sakura.
3062140	3066220	And those among those things is a game that's being remade.
3066220	3068820	And yes, everyone's like, yay, more remakes.
3068820	3074500	This one was a, I don't know, kind of a sleeper at first, a lollipop chainsaw.
3074500	3080340	There is going to be a rerelease for this in, uh, 2023.
3081300	3088180	It will have, uh, more, um, it actually is going to employ some of the previous staff
3088180	3094780	that worked on it and some newer staff and have quote more realistic and quote visuals.
3094780	3099540	It will have a new soundtrack because of licensing issues.
3099700	3110220	The big thing before that, um, is that, uh, there's a, uh, a quote on here from, uh, Yasuda
3110220	3114380	Yoshimi, who was the original games producer.
3114380	3119660	Um, unfortunately, various factors resulted in things making it so that fans can no longer
3119660	3121800	easily play lollipop chainsaw.
3121800	3126960	And it has been sometime since players have not been able to access the game on current
3126960	3127960	consoles.
3128440	3135560	In fact, this is absent, uh, from the Xbox backward compatibility list.
3135560	3137880	Um, the theory is it because of the music.
3137880	3144360	Um, so to continue the quote, um, we, the original development staff on lollipop chainsaw,
3144360	3149320	think of the game as very precious to us and did, and did not want to leave it in limbo
3149320	3151920	where players who want to play it cannot.
3151920	3157280	As such, we purchased the lollipop chainsaw intellectual properties from, uh, Kadokawa
3157280	3161600	games and decided to develop a remake.
3161600	3167480	Our goal is to make it easier for game, for games who want to play, I guess it means gamers
3167480	3169280	who want to play lollipop chainsaw to do so.
3169280	3172120	Please look forward to the games 2023 release.
3172120	3179440	So basically, uh, you play a underdressed cheerleader with her boyfriend's head attached
3179440	3182800	to her waist who kills somehow.
3182800	3183800	Yeah.
3183800	3190360	They're alive somehow and you chop them up.
3190360	3191800	It's weird.
3191800	3193080	As you should do to ex boyfriends.
3193080	3194840	Very mixed reviews on this game.
3194840	3195840	Yeah.
3195840	3196840	No, it wasn't her ex.
3196840	3198280	I think he was just like her love interest.
3198280	3199280	Oh, interesting.
3199280	3200280	Oh, okay.
3200280	3201280	Hmm.
3201280	3202280	Yeah.
3202280	3205840	I have to admit, I didn't really spend any time with it, but, um, I know it's kind of
3205840	3209720	a, uh, I guess cult classic could be the word thing you call it.
3209720	3210720	Yeah.
3210720	3212720	So, all right.
3212720	3217000	I'll, I'll have to see what this remakes all about when the trailer, uh, comes out.
3217000	3219000	Watch a play through of the game at some point.
3219000	3221040	You will just go, what did I watch?
3221040	3222040	What?
3222040	3226920	Uh, as soon as you went to Matt and chat says, yeah, James Gunn and Suda 51 said they only
3226920	3231280	found out about this a few weeks ago as these remake things tend to go sometimes.
3231280	3236560	Uh, and that's true of Hollywood as well as, you know, video games clearly.
3236560	3242680	So all right, well, uh, what is a new console that we won't be playing?
3242680	3246440	We won't be playing this remake on Loki.
3246440	3251240	So it's the newest scam console, the polium, a polium one.
3251240	3256640	It is bringing all of your favorite things in the gaming industry together.
3256640	3263680	Web 3.0 NFTs, the blockchain, and it's going to do amazing things like throw out specs
3263680	3265720	that it can't possibly hit.
3265720	3272440	It's going to be eight K, 120 FPS and ray tracing and it's going to, it's going to include
3272440	3276440	touch ID, which is somehow that's wholly owned by Apple.
3276440	3281520	So I don't know how that's possible, but it's, it's going to combine your wallets and it's
3281520	3286840	like somebody literally wrote every buzzword on a whiteboard and then said, okay, now put
3286840	3289840	that in a press release to raise funds.
3289840	3293140	Basically, yeah.
3293140	3298200	So they have like a roadmap and there's a bunch of other nonsense with it.
3298200	3303020	You have to buy, it's basically an elaborate rug pull is what it is because you have to
3303020	3307160	buy an NFT to like purchase the console.
3307160	3311120	But what's going to happen is you're going to buy all these NFTs and then they're going
3311120	3314340	to rug pull it and then you're stuck with NFTs that are worth nothing.
3314340	3316880	So keep it up.
3316880	3321920	But not only that, they came up with a very unoriginal logo, which sort of looks like
3321920	3323540	the GameCube logo.
3323540	3331860	It also ends up looking like logos for Pebble Host, which is a hosting company for the Minecraft
3331860	3334580	server I play on.
3334580	3335780	Exactly the same logo.
3335780	3339220	So yeah, just don't trust it.
3339220	3346140	It is, it is the 2022 Phantom or Amico, however you want to put that.
3346140	3350940	Well, I was going to say, which of these consoles are we more likely to see this web three console
3350940	3354380	or the Amico?
3354380	3355380	At this point?
3355380	3359780	You know, at this point, a console for me would be the one that's most likely to come
3359780	3364420	out is honestly like, I don't know.
3364420	3366260	I don't think any of this stuff's coming out.
3366260	3372340	There's only one way why YR could truly up his game.
3372340	3373340	Game console?
3373340	3374340	No.
3374340	3378300	Then we don't need a game console, especially like the stuff with the web three stuff that
3378300	3379300	they're talking about.
3380300	3381300	So what's it going to do?
3381300	3383460	It's going to run like HTML five games.
3383460	3385980	Like, why do I need a console for that?
3385980	3387460	Just do that through a PC.
3387460	3388460	Do that through your phone.
3388460	3390340	Like, why do I need a console for that?
3390340	3391540	What games are going to be on?
3391540	3394780	Oh, we're talking with people about getting games.
3394780	3397460	No, no, thank you.
3397460	3398460	Don't need.
3398460	3399900	Yeah, I have.
3399900	3403140	I will say this until I'm blue in the face.
3403140	3411060	Crypto games are going to be gar, budge, garbage until they ever are able to partner into an
3411060	3412260	existing franchise.
3412260	3413260	That is big.
3413260	3414260	Like I said, Pokemon.
3414260	3415600	You want to make NFTs popular?
3415600	3416940	Do you want people to talk about NFTs?
3416940	3419780	Do you want everybody to go fucking crazy about NFTs?
3419780	3423180	Get the Pokemon company on board until that happens.
3423180	3427100	It's it's like shovelware games are the types of games.
3427100	3428100	NFTs anyway.
3428100	3429100	Yeah.
3429100	3432020	So it's just, yeah.
3432060	3433900	Stop trying to make NFTs happen.
3433900	3434900	It's not happening.
3434900	3437060	And it just blows my mind again.
3437060	3441660	Again, it goes back to the ape NFT things where I'm like, what?
3441660	3442980	Why are that?
3442980	3446780	Why is that what you're trying to sell me NFTs with?
3446780	3449300	I mean, yikes.
3449300	3454740	Anyway, if you're going to make an NFT, make it pretty.
3454740	3457620	Questmaster in chat says, what titles are slated for this?
3457620	3459780	Repeats blockchain variants that can be built into games.
3459780	3460780	No, no, no.
3460780	3462140	Games can I look forward to?
3462140	3463140	It's not it's not there.
3463140	3464140	It's not there.
3464140	3465860	It's not there.
3465860	3466860	That's funny.
3466860	3467860	They say games.
3467860	3473740	I mean, because it's it's about it's about blockchain and the crypto and you know who
3473740	3475740	get in bed on with this.
3475740	3481060	It's a company that's just real ready to jump into the whole crypto space.
3481060	3482740	And they're looking for a new game console.
3482740	3483740	That'd be GameStop.
3483740	3487380	I was gonna say GameStop is going to back this.
3487380	3490060	There's saving grace.
3490060	3491060	It's going to happen.
3491060	3492060	Yeah.
3492060	3493940	Just like being extra failure.
3493940	3497740	No, you insert Funko Pops in order to power the console.
3497740	3503200	It just it shreds Funko Pops and feeds off their souls.
3503200	3504200	That's where you're wrong.
3504200	3507380	There's no souls in Funko Pops.
3507380	3515460	All right, moving on to a console that might get a little more love to help it play games
3515460	3517660	from an older console.
3517660	3521180	It's the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 3 emulation.
3521180	3525820	And you might be saying, but Rob, the PlayStation 5 can already play PlayStation 3 games, but
3525820	3527540	only through the cloud.
3527540	3534840	That is how the the PlayStation Plus service and its new like, you know, old games library.
3534840	3535840	That's how it works.
3535840	3540260	It's all through the cloud for PS3, for PS1 and 2, you can download them, but for PS3,
3540260	3541260	it's all through the cloud.
3541260	3548100	However, apparently the eagle eyed folks over on the Reset Era forums found a new job
3548100	3554180	ad that is suggesting that Sony is getting an engineer to get PlayStation 3 emulation
3554180	3557840	existing on the PlayStation 5.
3557840	3562820	From the job posting said our software development engineer position works on the tools and technology
3562820	3568800	team at PlayStation Studios to support the newly relaunched classics for PS4 and PS5.
3568800	3572160	Classic games run via emulation of legacy PlayStation platforms.
3572160	3576620	As a classics engineer, you would work closely with a group of other engineers, producers
3576620	3582200	and QA teams to fix bugs, add new features and develop new emulators.
3582200	3587720	That's the part that's getting everybody up in arms because what's the only emulator they
3587720	3590700	still need a PlayStation 3 one.
3590700	3595620	So because it's not like this thing is going to emulate Super Nintendo.
3595620	3599780	I mean, that would be cool, but I mean, it takes a lot of that's literally the only other
3599780	3601740	system that Sony has.
3601740	3608140	I can't think of any other systems that they would need to emulate on the PlayStation.
3608140	3612580	The PSP data, the PSP must be the Vita.
3612580	3613580	What's that?
3613580	3617180	I don't think Sony knows what a Vita is now.
3617180	3622480	They clearly don't know they they they've tried to erase that from history and all of
3622480	3623480	our memories.
3624120	3628240	It's all about the back touch panel, because that's where we need the touch panel to be
3628240	3630400	on the backside of a console.
3630400	3640520	Um, let's see, um, in chat, Zen Monkey says, Please don't ruin the PS5 with PS3 nonsense.
3640520	3645160	Not seeing how that I mean, an extra feature is not going to take away from any existing
3645160	3646160	feature.
3646160	3648680	So I'd be curious about that.
3648680	3652400	I don't understand any logic in that, sorry.
3652440	3654920	And victoryman chat says, ahem, we need Vita.
3654920	3656160	Yeah, we do need Vita.
3656160	3657160	That's for sure.
3657160	3659240	Orange Wright says PS mobile clearly.
3659240	3662080	Oh, that's the one that's the one forgot about.
3662080	3668520	But that would be good because if we get PlayStation mobile, then that means we could have pixel
3668520	3672040	poops on the PlayStation five.
3672040	3678440	Because that that was the Vita's like arm of that was the PS mobile stuff on the Vita
3678440	3679440	shop, right?
3680120	3685080	Yeah, that was the kind of like, you know, you can make your own you can self published on
3685080	3686800	the PlayStation Store type thing.
3688080	3690040	Yeah, I'll be curious to see what happens to that.
3690840	3693560	All right, let's go to our next story.
3694200	3698360	Oh, by the way, Zen Monkey did follow up with a comment saying resources spent on old crap
3698360	3700240	slows down work on the new stuff.
3701480	3705680	I do understand that whole there's only so many pieces of the pie to go around.
3705680	3709240	But remember, this story is coming from a new job posting.
3709480	3713880	So it is possible Sony is adding the resources to deal with this to not take away from
3713880	3715560	anything else. I think that's worth considering.
3715680	3718360	So but anyhow, let's shift gears here.
3718360	3721040	This is kind of more of a special interest story, but I think this is neat.
3721040	3721640	Dark Sakura.
3722800	3733040	So, well, I think it's also kind of interesting that this is a government thing, but the
3733040	3740400	State Department has been pushing for a diplomacy program for game design.
3741520	3749160	So it did its first school last last month, that would be in June, 450 students from
3749160	3756320	across U.S., Israel, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain did a 10 week program called the
3756320	3762640	Game Exchange and completed a total of 170 new video games that were based off of the
3762640	3765320	United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
3765840	3773000	So if you're unfamiliar with what those goals are, they're also called the Global Goals
3773120	3779200	adopted by the UN in 2015 as a call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and
3779200	3783080	ensure that by 2030, all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
3784520	3787760	So there's many different things that that involves.
3787760	3793520	But going back to this, basically the participants were in up to three video
3793520	3802240	conference calls with their international compatriots there, and they were at a sister
3802240	3805880	school that was in addition to seven or eight sessions.
3806240	3809880	So a total between 20 to 25 hours among themselves.
3810400	3816240	So the teachers also involved in that were paid to help navigate through the game
3816240	3824920	development process. So the goal is to foster long term relations while teaching
3824920	3825920	them how to make games.
3826440	3831760	So the Game Exchange received a grant from the Stevens Initiative, which is funded by
3831760	3835760	the U.S. State Department and the Bezos Family Foundation.
3836120	3837840	Yeah, Bezos.
3838800	3845200	That is Jackie Bezos, the president and co-founder of the Bezos Family Foundation, who
3845200	3849040	is Jeff Bezos' mother, who also owns The Washington Post.
3851480	3855000	At any rate, they want to double the number of students next year.
3856320	3862640	They're still working on a quantitative analysis of the program, but they think that
3862640	3867880	this is going to be a really good way to facilitate person to person diplomacy on
3867880	3873480	issues like climate change, gender equity and food security, especially among the
3873480	3880760	younger generation. The acting deputy assistant secretary for professional and
3880760	3882480	cultural exchanges for the U.S.
3882840	3888000	Department of State, that's Chris Minor, is quoted saying the virtual exchange is the
3888000	3891880	beginning of what we hope to be a lasting relationship that moves beyond gaming.
3892960	3894880	Students were really positive on it.
3894880	3899040	They wanted more opportunities to interact with other students and go abroad during the
3899040	3912600	program. And there's a couple of people like a 16-year-old who said that they'd never
3912600	3915600	met someone outside of the country except from Canada.
3916120	3924400	And she was interested in it because she had been a Fortnite player after the pandemic
3924400	3926680	started and wanted to make her own games.
3927480	3932280	But she said that she wasn't sure that the cross-cultural aspect was going to work.
3932280	3938880	And then it changed when one of the Israeli students said, shit.
3942160	3944640	And then they're like, oh, you talk like we do.
3944640	3946080	All right, we're all we're all kids.
3946080	3948200	We all kind of deal with the same stuff.
3949040	3953200	And I don't know, just took one little thing, but everyone's like, yeah, we're on this
3953200	3956000	same the same wavelength on here.
3956000	3959760	So is this about diplomacy through video games or just diplomacy through bad words?
3960840	3969440	I don't know, but it was the getting together and trying something new.
3969440	3975720	But they also learned a lot about the background of game development and about the
3975720	3976960	background of each other.
3977680	3985960	One of one of the Israeli students was basically like he wanted to connect with
3985960	3989120	American kids through gaming and sports and music.
3989120	3991720	He said he's a fan of basketball.
3991720	3997080	He was a fan of the Detroit Pistons and he knows the Kiss song, Detroit Rock City.
3997600	4001480	And other than that, he didn't have any expectations about the Detroit students, but
4001480	4002640	they worked together and had fun.
4005240	4006480	I think that's good.
4006560	4007680	Yeah, I think it's neat.
4007680	4012920	You know, it's, you know, the thing that isn't so explicitly pointed out by this article
4012920	4016680	is that video games are art and it's it's people bonding.
4016680	4020920	And it's it's, you know, the world coming together through art and being able to speak
4020920	4022160	that common language.
4022560	4023520	And I think that's really neat.
4024320	4031840	Well, actually, that is sort of mentioned in there is that they the big thing was they
4031880	4036720	wanted to create the games and share the culture and that the culture was the bonding
4036720	4042000	point and that that would help them build the friendships with other people in the world.
4044040	4048360	Well, I mean, best of best of luck to them in their development efforts and so forth, I
4048360	4051520	look forward to seeing, you know, what they what they all come up with when they put their
4051520	4054160	heads together. So it's already happened.
4054440	4056400	So we'll see what next year brings.
4057240	4058560	Cool. All right.
4059880	4061480	Let's move on, Loki.
4061840	4063360	With a follow up of sorts.
4065080	4072600	Yes. So you may remember that EA made some really stupid tweets the other week was the
4072600	4074600	other week. Geez, I don't even know it anymore.
4074600	4076440	It was June 30th.
4076480	4081480	OK, so, yeah, I was about two weeks ago, a week and a half talking about single player
4081480	4085560	games and how like there are there are 10, but only like playing single player games.
4085840	4089680	And everyone's like, you've killed so many single player games, you jerks.
4090280	4097760	And so apparently because of that, you know, devs are angry at them and it's also caused
4097760	4102080	roundtable meetings with staff kind of saying, what the hell are you doing?
4102080	4109440	Stupid. You know, basically they said the most agreed on idea was to take responsibility
4109440	4110920	for it and apologize.
4111560	4114640	However, instead, they decided to post, you know, roast.
4114640	4119800	Well deserved. We'll take the L because playing single player games actually makes them an
4119800	4122960	11. God, that's so cringe.
4123000	4124320	Like, stop.
4124360	4125960	Just don't pretend.
4126440	4127440	Just say, you know what?
4127760	4131120	Sorry. Yeah, we understand how you may have taken offense to that.
4131560	4132080	I have done.
4132080	4133080	Hello, fellow teenagers.
4133280	4134400	I have better advice.
4134880	4135800	Delete your account.
4137280	4138640	That's my advice. Delete your account.
4139320	4145360	They're saying that a lot of the folks that are running the EA like social network, they said
4146400	4150960	they're I'm not I'm not or I'm 99 percent sure that the person who posted the tweet and their
4150960	4155400	manager don't even know about single player games comment from a decade ago.
4156720	4162080	It says also that the source of further sources are saying that the staff were in a Twitter
4162080	4168320	account are all new and most of them aren't really game industry people and likely had no idea
4168320	4172040	about EA's long, bad history with single player games.
4172080	4172880	Congrats.
4172880	4174200	You played yourself.
4174280	4178480	I I don't even know what else to say like that.
4178480	4182360	Just what a bad fucking decision from the very top that was.
4182360	4187880	And I that's stop trying to place the blame on somebody who is trying to come in and do their
4187880	4192000	job. You know, you wanted to hire somebody new with not a lot of gaming background because they
4192000	4194600	were cheap. Who is would hop on these trends?
4194760	4196840	You know what? They did what they were asked to do.
4197560	4203160	You made the mistake of and did I hear that they were like naughty, like they were an outsource
4203160	4205200	company potentially, too. They weren't even EA employees.
4205800	4210240	I don't even know. But like, like, why even tweet that in the first place?
4210280	4215520	There are 10, but they only like playing it was a stupid Twitter trend that was going on.
4215560	4216680	I understand that.
4216680	4220840	But like, do we need corporations to get in on Twitter trends?
4221480	4227760	Really ask RadioShack or RadioShack isn't really RadioShack anymore.
4227760	4228520	Wendy's.
4228520	4229520	I'll give you Wendy's.
4229520	4231120	But yeah.
4231160	4231440	Okay.
4231440	4233400	DJ Rama says it was an outsize company.
4233640	4239640	That's again, like I said, it's completely then you played yourself and these executives got
4239640	4242920	exactly what they deserved.
4243400	4244080	Period.
4244080	4245720	Have some good advice to them.
4246400	4248120	Don't delete your account.
4248120	4249640	That's my advice.
4249680	4252680	Just just don't don't do anything.
4252680	4255200	Just let it don't even delete it.
4255200	4257400	Just let it sit fallow.
4258160	4260080	Let it decompose.
4260080	4262520	I don't know. Just don't don't anymore.
4263600	4268200	As Joe 100 Matt says, if it was a third party contractor sending this out, shouldn't you as the
4268200	4270000	company approved said copy?
4270120	4271600	A very, very excellent point.
4274400	4275600	Not if they don't care.
4278000	4279360	That's what we hired them for.
4279360	4280240	Let them do it.
4280760	4281120	Yeah.
4282120	4282560	All right.
4283120	4284840	This is our next story.
4284840	4288920	This is some people's worst nightmare when it comes to digital content.
4288920	4290600	And it's just coming true.
4291200	4293480	And this has to do with PlayStation.
4293680	4296600	But I will stress this is not in the US.
4296600	4298320	This is happening overseas.
4298320	4306240	It's the German and Austrian versions of PSN have lost movies from Studio Canal or I should say
4306240	4308920	they will be removed on August 31st.
4309160	4310120	But here's the thing.
4311120	4316200	It doesn't just apply to 100 films that were available for purchase on the PlayStation Store.
4316480	4323440	But if you previously purchased this, you can no longer access the film after August 31st.
4325080	4328760	And there's a lot of like big movies that are a part of this.
4329160	4334320	If I were to actually go to a list of all of them, all dogs go to heaven.
4334320	4336280	Well, your PlayStation is not going.
4336280	4337720	Oh, the Blair Witch.
4338040	4338600	Wow.
4339320	4339720	Let's see.
4339720	4344200	It was because I see the picture on this site is this is Spinal Tap.
4344480	4351480	So but, you know, all of the Hunger Games are in there and so on and so on.
4351480	4353520	There's a lot of movies that are affected by this.
4355360	4360200	Yeah, this is kind of crappy because this is why people don't want to buy their stuff digitally.
4360520	4361400	I'm not sure.
4361400	4366280	I mean, again, this is in Germany, Austria, so it doesn't affect the US.
4366480	4369160	But I'm sitting here going, how is this legal?
4369720	4372360	Like, aren't they just asking to get sued over this?
4372560	4382480	The consumer doesn't give a fuck about the licensing, but they're going to say, like, I paid for something and you took it away and you didn't give a refund because we haven't heard anything about refunds yet.
4383200	4385640	So it's yeah.
4385800	4392280	So anyway, we're only talking about a certain type of content in two countries, but it's still a precedent.
4392280	4393640	I mean, it's two countries.
4393640	4395360	It's no small, you know, thing.
4395640	4402760	But it's still like, hey, why is the publisher allowed to even remove access in the first place?
4403000	4405400	And I think this is going to get ugly.
4405400	4407240	And I know you shouldn't read that.
4407240	4409080	I wonder what's in the user agreement.
4409560	4412280	You know, it's funny, I shouldn't read the comments, but I'm going to.
4412280	4413960	And there's actually a meme here.
4413960	4417400	Hold on. I'm going to show this on stream because it's just too funny.
4418000	4420960	But on this site that I'm looking at here, it has this meme.
4421360	4424080	You can always pirate digital media.
4424280	4426200	It's always morally correct.
4429320	4437880	And that you know what, as as much as that's a meme and stuff, I think that is exactly where a lot of people are going to go.
4439680	4441280	With this, for sure.
4441280	4442640	Yeah, no.
4443280	4448240	DJ Rama S in chat says, remember, you only own a license to view the material, not own it.
4448560	4454000	I still think when you tick off the user base and there's lawsuits, but again, I can't profess to sit here and
4454080	4457840	go, I know what the recourse is in Germany and Austria.
4457840	4466760	But I also now go, you know what, when people are like, hell, no, I don't want a digital PlayStation 5 or no, I don't want my games digitally.
4466760	4468400	I still want games on disk.
4468560	4471080	Can you blame them when you see a story like this?
4471080	4472560	Can you blame people that want to go that route?
4472560	4473280	Because I sure don't.
4474880	4476320	So anyway.
4477560	4482720	Let's take a trip back to a time when there wasn't digital only versions of stuff.
4483120	4487600	Digital was only possible through a 9600 baud modem in our next segment.
4498040	4505440	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4505800	4508560	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4508560	4513760	And what did you pick for the game this week, Dark Sakura?
4514560	4515200	Ikaruga.
4515840	4517640	Wow, this has never been done before.
4517640	4523400	I'm always shocked at the games that somehow have not made it to the classic game of the week yet.
4523520	4524320	And this is one of them.
4525480	4536960	So Ikaruga is a shoot-em-up that was developed by Treasure, and it is the spiritual successor to a radiant silver gun that came out in 1998.
4537320	4554480	This was originally released in Japanese arcades in December of 2001, where you play a pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using a specially designed fighter called the Ikaruga that can flip between polarities from black to white.
4554880	4558320	The polarity is really the foundation of the game.
4558760	4562560	So all of the enemies and bullets are either black or white.
4563160	4568240	The bullets of the same color as the player are absorbed while the others will hurt you.
4568560	4570320	So you can actually switch between the both.
4570320	4572440	And the game has both single and co-op mode.
4573720	4587920	A little bit about its development is that the director had been working on some things.
4588160	4598240	By the way, that's Iuchi Hiroshi, but he'd been working on the game during off hours when Treasure was making Sin and Punishment in 2000.
4599120	4608160	It began as a direct sequel to Radiant Silver Gun and had the polarity mechanism from Silhouette Mirage from 1997.
4608560	4611400	The prototype had limited ammo.
4611800	4618480	The bullet absorption was meant to refill ammo, but they found it weak since it caused breaks in the action.
4619040	4624360	And also Treasure has a very specific game design philosophy.
4624840	4636560	And Ikaruga was intentionally built to challenge the conventions of standard game design and develop a new type of shooting game.
4637160	4647240	So altogether, five of the staff at Treasure worked on Ikaruga and then three of the support staff from G-Rev.
4648680	4655840	So when it was released in Japanese arcades, it really had a mixed reaction.
4656120	4657840	It was new, it was different.
4657840	4659920	People were like, we don't like different stuff.
4660320	4667040	But, you know, it was a little bit more like a puzzle where you could dodge those bullets or absorb the bullets.
4668480	4673160	It did get a port to the Dreamcast in 2002, which I have.
4674800	4684840	And then it started developing a following from import gamers, especially the people who probably couldn't afford Radiant Silver Gun,
4684840	4689000	like somebody talking on this microphone sitting in this chair right now.
4690160	4698360	It did get a later release in the West in 2003 on GameCube and had very positive reviews.
4699280	4703600	It was praised for graphics and the art and the sound design.
4705000	4714040	People's biggest problem with it was its difficulty, but they all thought that the game design was really innovative
4714600	4724200	and that it just basically, you know, kicked other shooter games kind of on its side.
4724640	4731760	So, of course, it was ported to the Xbox 360, to Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4.
4732200	4741120	And now in retrospect, this game was considered to be one of the best shoot-em-ups and one of Treasure's best games.
4741680	4743760	So a little bit more about the gameplay.
4743760	4746240	It is vertically scrolling.
4747520	4750200	You can either play single or two-player co-op.
4751480	4762240	And so when you see a burst of bullets of a certain color, you can switch to that color of bullet to absorb,
4762680	4767080	but you have to shoot with the opposite color one.
4767600	4770680	Now, Fifth Stream is talking about turning your TV on the side.
4770680	4772640	You can get monitors that swivel.
4775360	4781600	And I have to check my Dreamcast version, but I think that it did support vertical mode.
4784440	4788320	But the home ports also had additional gameplay modes.
4790560	4796480	You could have practice from single stages that you've already unlocked at normal or slow speed.
4797400	4801840	There's a challenge mode that logs your score in comparison to others worldwide.
4802960	4814600	And then if conditions are met, there's a prototype mode which limits your bullets and you have to replace your bullets by absorbing other bullets to refill your ammo.
4816480	4826440	And then there's an alternative way called Bullet Eater, where you do not fire any shots and navigate through the game by absorbing bullets.
4827480	4836600	So with the development of it, it was self-funded and self-published.
4839440	4850800	It was worked on at home and the prototype was made between Iichi Hiroshi and Nakagawa Atsutomo.
4850800	4869760	And they borrowed elements from their own other games, and as far as the defense system, that was inspired by Shinrei Jusatsuchi Tadomaru that came out on Sega Saturn.
4870720	4881960	Some sprites were reused from Radiant Silver Gun to do the prototype quickly, and then they brought it up for testing and finally implemented the final system.
4882280	4884280	So it is considered a spiritual sequel.
4884280	4891120	Radiant Silver Gun was supposed to be a trilogy, and so Ikaruga was supposed to be the direct sequel.
4891680	4902600	And it was codenamed Project RS2, as in Radiant Silver Gun 2, where the concept for Radiant Silver Gun was a world for Ikaruga, it was will.
4903040	4907200	And so they really wanted to just push the limits and change things.
4907200	4910720	But after a while, it sort of became its own creature.
4911720	4921720	It was targeted to Treasure's core fan base, so they were really looking for what Treasure fans wanted, not necessarily a broader market.
4923720	4931720	And the NAOMI version was actually bug checked on a Dreamcast, so doing the port was really easy.
4932720	4941720	So it was released in arcades on December 20th, 2001, and the Dreamcast port was exclusively sold in Japan starting September 5th, 2002.
4941720	4946720	And lots of people imported it. I imported it. That game was great.
4946720	4952720	It was published for GameCube in Japan under the Atari label.
4952720	4957720	Sorry, Infogrames did that release on January 16th, 2003.
4957720	4962720	And then later on it came out in the US and Europe on GameCube.
4962720	4971720	And it was because of that import fan base that it saw really big success on the GameCube.
4971720	4984720	So Microsoft released it for Xbox Live for Xbox 360 on April 9th, 2008, with new leaderboards, achievements, and recording and replaying your playthroughs.
4984720	4994720	Treasure released Ikaruga on the Nesic Axe Live, which is an arcade distribution platform, on August 8th, 2013.
4994720	5000720	And then Treasure put it on Steam Greenlight for Windows.
5000720	5008720	And then it came out on Steam on February 18th, 2014, published by Nichols for Nintendo Switch on May 29th, 2018.
5008720	5012720	It also supported horizontal and vertical screen orientation.
5012720	5017720	June 2018, it came on PlayStation 4, November 22nd, 2019.
5017720	5022720	There were physical copies in production for the Switch and the PlayStation 4.
5022720	5028720	It was, I mean, this game got some pretty hardcore great reviews.
5028720	5032720	It was considered innovative, clever, and unique.
5032720	5037720	The difficulty was a plus for some, a minus for others.
5038720	5051720	So the Dreamcast version for GameSpot and Dorimaga were about an 8.5 out of 10.
5051720	5057720	The GameCube versions, Famitsu gave it a 36 out of 40, which is pretty damn good.
5057720	5060720	Nintendo Life gave it a 9 out of 10.
5060720	5063720	Metacritic gave it an 85 out of 100.
5063720	5067720	So it was an amazing seller.
5067720	5073720	The Dreamcast and GameCube versions sold 33,860 physical units in Japan.
5073720	5080720	Xbox Live Arcade sold 137,088 digital units as of 2011.
5080720	5090720	And the PC version on Steam sold 128,543 digital units as of July 1st, 2018.
5090720	5091720	And there you go.
5092720	5096720	I agree with Questbuster in chat who says it's such a beautiful game too.
5096720	5098720	Treasures creativity really shines through.
5098720	5101720	It is, but I gotta be honest, like this game is very hard for me to play.
5101720	5105720	Like I have a hard time wrapping my head around the polarity mechanic.
5105720	5111720	Like it's just, it's a lot to manage, you know, but yeah, like watching this video
5111720	5113720	that we're seeing live on Twitch of somebody doing now,
5113720	5116720	I think this is some type of record run, but still I'm just like,
5116720	5119720	oh my gosh, there's just so much going on in the game.
5119720	5121720	Seeing this game beaten in person.
5121720	5123720	Yeah, yeah.
5123720	5126720	With an almost perfect playthrough.
5126720	5129720	Or when they do the bullet eater modes, that's always fun.
5129720	5130720	Yeah.
5130720	5134720	The bullet eater mode is ridiculous.
5134720	5136720	But I mean, this game is just so beautiful.
5136720	5141720	I mean, there's times where, you know, I'll come in and Dan was napping on the couch
5141720	5146720	with a playthrough of Ikaruga in the background to listen to the soundtrack.
5146720	5147720	But it's so beautiful.
5147720	5151720	And for a game that came out in 2001.
5151720	5156720	So we're talking about a game that's 21 years old as of December.
5156720	5161720	This game still stands up graphically and by artistry and by music.
5161720	5165720	It's really, really timeless.
5165720	5167720	I say it's timeless.
5167720	5169720	It's a true classic.
5169720	5171720	And again, why I kind of joked at the beginning there,
5171720	5174720	sometimes we have games in this segment where it's like, really?
5174720	5175720	We haven't done that before?
5175720	5177720	But no, we just we just talk about it a lot,
5177720	5179720	but never officially as a classic game of the week.
5179720	5183720	But now that has been remedied.
5183720	5184720	It is.
5184720	5187720	It's just a perfect game.
5187720	5188720	Yeah.
5188720	5189720	All right.
5189720	5190720	That's what I call a perfect game.
5190720	5193720	Ikaruga, the classic game of the week.
5193720	5194720	Need we say more?
5194720	5195720	All right.
5195720	5198720	We're going to travel around and check out some news quickly
5198720	5200720	in a segment called Rapid Fire News.
5200720	5202720	And Loki, we'll start with you.
5202720	5205720	I keep telling myself I don't need things like this
5205720	5207720	because I have no place to put them.
5207720	5209720	But good luck.
5209720	5215720	Nintendo and Lego have partnered again to create a new Lego thing.
5215720	5219720	And this time it is King Koopa.
5219720	5226720	So you can get a very large scale Koopa creation.
5226720	5228720	They call it the Mighty Bowser.
5228720	5229720	That's what it is.
5229720	5231720	It's going to be in stores October 1st
5231720	5234720	for two hundred and sixty nine ninety nine.
5235720	5236720	Too expensive.
5236720	5238720	I'm not paying three hundred dollars.
5238720	5239720	I'm not paying three hundred dollars for that.
5239720	5241720	Sorry.
5241720	5242720	I love Legos.
5242720	5245720	I love doing all that stuff, but no.
5245720	5246720	You know what?
5246720	5249720	I came damn close to buying before I bought the Spice Girls thing,
5249720	5252720	which was only like maybe 40 bucks, which Spice Girls are priceless.
5252720	5253720	I'll pay whatever for that.
5253720	5256720	But the which also.
5256720	5258720	OK, a second tangent.
5259720	5263720	Do you know how like there's that whole generation that a lot of us fit into,
5263720	5267720	which is like somewhere between the geriatric millennial
5267720	5271720	and the young Gen X that is often called like the Oregon Trail generation
5271720	5273720	or Zillennial, I think is the other one.
5273720	5276720	I heard that called the other day the Spice Girls generation.
5276720	5278720	And I was like, that's what I want.
5278720	5279720	That's me.
5279720	5280720	Yes.
5280720	5283720	Use that one referring to my people.
5283720	5285720	But anyway, not me.
5285720	5287720	Well, humbug.
5287720	5292720	Anyway, like I was in the radio head,
5292720	5296720	but in all seriousness, I did not realize you could still get the Lego
5296720	5299720	NES with the the rolling TV and that stuff.
5299720	5302720	I thought that was like a limited edition thing, but they still had it at the store.
5302720	5304720	So I really wanted to get that.
5304720	5305720	I still might.
5305720	5306720	I don't know.
5306720	5307720	We'll see.
5307720	5308720	But they passed.
5308720	5311720	So there's there's buttons on this thing where you can puppet him
5311720	5313720	to make him move around and shoot fireballs.
5313720	5315720	I may have to get this.
5316720	5317720	Just say it's for the kids.
5317720	5319720	Say it's for the kids.
5319720	5321720	Who's going to actually believe that, Rob?
5321720	5323720	No one's going to believe that.
5323720	5324720	All right.
5324720	5326720	What else you got?
5326720	5328720	And then, of course, this is kind of funny.
5328720	5335720	So there was an Xbox live stream that was shown on Twitch.
5335720	5339720	And apparently during the clip.
5339720	5343720	It's it was it was saying that, oh,
5343720	5346720	my acting coach actually is the voice of She-Hulk,
5346720	5349720	and I won't say her name because I don't know if that's public knowledge yet.
5349720	5352720	I think it is if it was announced.
5352720	5357720	And then unfortunately, the lead designer is like, nope, we never announced She-Hulk.
5357720	5360720	We don't announce things on these live streams.
5360720	5367720	So unfortunately, it's been rumored that She-Hulk is coming to the Marvel's Avengers game.
5367720	5369720	Looks like that's going to be.
5369720	5370720	She's awesome.
5370720	5377720	Probably if I were to guess, because they've been releasing characters in certain cadence.
5377720	5382720	There is a Marvel She-Hulk show that's starting in August, right?
5382720	5385720	I mean, it's probably going to be when that comes out.
5385720	5387720	That's a pretty good guess.
5387720	5389720	It's a pretty safe wager there.
5389720	5391720	But you know what?
5391720	5393720	Hosting live is hard.
5393720	5396720	And sometimes I can speak with some authority on that.
5396720	5397720	And you know what?
5397720	5401720	Sometimes, now granted, I don't host stuff where I have NDAs in the back of my head,
5401720	5404720	but I can see where somebody makes some mistakes.
5404720	5408720	I actually feel sorry for the host, you know, even though it makes a moment that goes viral.
5408720	5410720	That's not the thing you want to go viral for.
5410720	5412720	It's just a bummer.
5412720	5416720	So I hope she doesn't get reprimanded or anything.
5416720	5418720	It's just unfortunate.
5418720	5420720	So, all right.
5420720	5422720	Dark Soccer, you have something.
5422720	5423720	I do.
5423720	5431720	So, for fans of The Matrix, The Matrix Awakens will be delisted this week.
5431720	5438720	Because the Unreal Engine 5 experience will be leaving the digital consoles on July 9th.
5438720	5443720	If you have it, then you can still use it.
5443720	5446720	You can kind of like how the PT was.
5446720	5452720	But if you don't get it by yesterday, there's no getting it again.
5452720	5455720	Which I forgot to do. I'm really mad at myself.
5455720	5457720	It's fine.
5457720	5458720	I know.
5458720	5462720	But maybe someone will put out a clone or something.
5462720	5463720	Maybe, maybe.
5463720	5466720	Yeah, but at any rate, you know, there's always the internet.
5466720	5467720	You can always watch it online.
5467720	5468720	True.
5468720	5471720	All right, well, I also have one quick story for you.
5471720	5474720	And it's something that Jason mentioned in the intro to the show tonight.
5474720	5476720	And he said this made him smile.
5476720	5479720	And yeah, this made me smile really big, too.
5479720	5484720	And it makes me want to pay attention to this console that admittedly I'm not paying enough attention to.
5484720	5485720	It's a great console.
5485720	5487720	You've got my attention, that's for sure.
5487720	5489720	And that is Evercade.
5489720	5492720	And their C64 collection that's coming out.
5492720	5496720	Fourteen classic games from the Commodore 64.
5496720	5502720	Including summer games, winter games, Impossible Mission, Jumpman, so like all the epic necessities.
5502720	5503720	I love Jumpman.
5503720	5504720	I love Jumpman.
5504720	5509720	Gateway to ASFI, the Movie Monster game, which I don't see that one in collections a lot.
5509720	5512720	Storm Lord, Battle Valley, Alley Cat.
5512720	5515720	I know I played that one when I was younger.
5515720	5518720	Street Sports Baseball, because you have to have a sports game in there.
5518720	5519720	And so on and so on.
5519720	5522720	I got to say, this collection looks awesome.
5522720	5528720	Now, of course, the mini Commodore 64 has 30 games on it, and this only has 14.
5528720	5531720	But it's a pretty solid list of 14 games.
5531720	5537720	And they do label it the C64 Collection 1, which indicates there will be more in the future.
5537720	5538720	But I think this is pretty cool.
5538720	5542720	And I got to say, I'm kind of interested in picking up an Evercade.
5542720	5546720	And I don't know a lot about it, but it's because it's mostly...
5546720	5548720	They're made in Europe, right?
5548720	5550720	So they're not exactly on the shelves here, right?
5550720	5551720	Yeah, they're...
5551720	5555720	I don't know if I've ever seen them on the shelves, but they have like a ton of stuff in there.
5556720	5560720	Yeah, they have a ton of Atari stuff, and they have a lot of cartridges.
5560720	5566720	I wish I could get involved with some of this, but there's a lot of Nest Maker game collections that are on there.
5567720	5577720	There's a lot of stuff, and plus they have a handheld console, and then they have the actual physical console that's in a TV.
5577720	5583720	What's kind of cool about the TV consoles is you can actually have two of your cartridges loaded in there at the same time.
5583720	5586720	So you can play a bunch of games on there.
5587720	5593720	But yeah, it's a pretty solid console, I think, with all the different things coming out.
5593720	5601720	Speaking of which, I know there's a new Commodore 64 mini console coming out, but it's more of a computer that they're charging like $500 for.
5601720	5604720	Yeah, it's kind of like what the Atari VCS thing, yeah.
5604720	5609720	Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a nice shell, but this is pretty cool to see this kind of stuff.
5611720	5613720	Did they say California games? Oh, summer games?
5613720	5615720	No, summer games and winter games.
5615720	5618720	So it's missing summer games too, and it's missing California games.
5618720	5620720	Well, that's probably where number two is going to be.
5620720	5625720	Exactly. So just so we're clear, some of the stuff that's on the Evercade.
5625720	5630720	Evercade has right now 27 cartridges for consoles.
5630720	5636720	And what's kind of cool about it, I mean, you start with like the Atari collection, the Namco collection, right?
5636720	5642720	But then you start to really get the Atari Lynx collection is available, one and two.
5642720	5650720	The Codemasters collection, there's an Intellivision collection, the Gremlin collection, which I think is kind of cool.
5650720	5652720	And then they have some arcade stuff too.
5652720	5655720	So there's, yeah, it's pretty cool.
5655720	5658720	And now they're getting into this computer cartridge collection.
5658720	5661720	So with the C64 collection, I'm sure there'll be more.
5661720	5662720	There'll have to be more.
5662720	5666720	Yeah, I don't know where locally I can get an Evercade, but those are pretty cool looking.
5666720	5668720	Yeah, that's pretty neat.
5668720	5670720	It definitely has my attention. I might have to pick some of that up.
5670720	5674720	I love the fact that there's like a TV console and a handheld one and the cartridges kind of work on both.
5674720	5675720	It's pretty cool.
5675720	5681720	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some new games you can check out this week.
5681720	5684720	Well, maybe some repackaging and remasters too.
5684720	5688720	But let's check out the world release date, starting with the US with Loki.
5688720	5695720	Yes, so I can't imagine there's a whole lot coming out in July, which is typically the case.
5695720	5700720	We've got Fist, Forged in Shadow Torch.
5700720	5703720	That is coming out on Nintendo Switch.
5703720	5708720	Garden Story on Xbox One and Xbox Series.
5708720	5710720	Hella Point.
5710720	5712720	Oh, I'm sorry, that's Hell Point.
5712720	5715720	That's on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5716720	5719720	Kroot, the Mythic Wings.
5719720	5725720	That's on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5725720	5729720	Monument Valley Panoramic Edition on PC.
5729720	5734720	And same with that, Monument Valley 2, the Panoramic Edition, also on PC.
5734720	5741720	And then Time on Frog Island on PC, Nintendo Switch.
5741720	5745720	PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
5745720	5749720	I don't believe this is a sequel to Frog Fractions, unfortunately.
5749720	5752720	Loopmancer on PC.
5752720	5756720	Rune Factory 5, also on PC.
5756720	5761720	Tales of Biston on PC and Xbox One.
5761720	5764720	Okay, I guess there's everything coming out this week.
5764720	5767720	You know, normally July is pretty light.
5767720	5773720	Azure Strikers Gunvolt 2 on Xbox One, Xbox Series.
5773720	5777720	What is this title?
5777720	5780720	Let's see, Chickip Dancers.
5780720	5786720	Nori Nori Dance de Kokoro Mo Otoro.
5786720	5789720	And that's on Nintendo Switch.
5789720	5795720	Escape Academy on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
5795720	5801720	Eyes in the Dark, The Curious Case of One Victoria Bloom on PC.
5801720	5810720	G-Mode Archives Plus, Megami Tensei Gaiden, Shinyaku Last Bible on Nintendo Switch.
5810720	5816720	Mothman 1966 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5816720	5820720	The most exciting release of the week, Powerwash Simulator.
5820720	5823720	I'm guessing we're finally hitting 1.0 or something like that.
5823720	5826720	That's on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5826720	5827720	Game Pass for that one.
5827720	5829720	Yep, Game Pass.
5829720	5832720	Worth Life on Nintendo Switch.
5832720	5837720	Dread Out 2 on Xbox One, Xbox Series.
5837720	5842720	And last but not least, The Future You've Been Dreaming Of on PC.
5842720	5843720	It's a simulation game.
5843720	5844720	Fun.
5844720	5846720	All right, we're going to Japan.
5846720	5849720	It's not quite as crowded as Loki's US list,
5849720	5852720	but we do have some of the crossovers on the Nintendo Switch in Japan this week.
5852720	5858720	We had that same Chik-Kip Dancers, which that sounded like a Japanese release anyway.
5858720	5862720	But yeah, that same release is on the Switch in Japan on the 14th,
5862720	5867720	as is Bokuura no Kishigomu Otoshi Shingake.
5867720	5872720	Plus, All Seasons in Joy set is also on the Switch this week.
5872720	5874720	I think it's a collection of games.
5874720	5879720	It looks like curling and hockey and a bunch of mini sports games,
5879720	5881720	maybe played in a school yard type of thing.
5881720	5885720	Wreckfest is also out on the Switch this week in Japan.
5885720	5890720	Going to the PlayStation 5, Outward is the big release this week on the PlayStation 5,
5890720	5894720	and that is the Definitive Edition that is releasing in Japan this week.
5894720	5897720	Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.
5897720	5901720	All on the 15th for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch,
5901720	5905720	DC League of Super Pets, Adventure of Crypto and Ace,
5905720	5910720	and then Ultra Age on PlayStation and Switch, and that is it.
5910720	5913720	All right. We have a few more stories for you,
5913720	5915720	and then we will get to the listener roundtable,
5915720	5917720	where we'll be taking your calls in our green room,
5917720	5919720	as well as your emails.
5919720	5922720	Participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to email us.
5922720	5925720	Let's get to this next story, which...
5925720	5930720	Just get to it, Loki, while I sigh.
5930720	5933720	Yeah, so before we get to that,
5933720	5936720	I wanted to mention the United States Best Buy carries the advocate.
5936720	5937720	Oh, really?
5937720	5939720	So that might be worth checking out.
5939720	5940720	That's some good news.
5940720	5941720	Yes, that's some good news.
5941720	5943720	Not good news, unfortunately,
5943720	5949720	is apparently there's been some misunderstandings.
5949720	5954720	Apparently, the Prime Minister of Japan,
5954720	5959720	Shinzo Abe, has been assassinated,
5959720	5965720	and in Greece, apparently, some news station identified,
5965720	5970720	or showed a picture of Hideo Kojima as the assassin.
5970720	5973720	Now, I don't think that's correct.
5973720	5975720	It is not correct. Let's be clear.
5975720	5978720	Obviously.
5978720	5980720	And so they've been kind of, you know,
5980720	5983720	spreading this misinformation for a while.
5983720	5986720	So now that that's, you know, come out,
5986720	5988720	obviously, Hideo Kojima is like,
5988720	5990720	no, I'm not the assassin,
5990720	5993720	and then also, I'm going to sue you
5993720	5996720	if you keep, you know, posting my photo
5996720	5998720	and saying I'm the assassin.
5998720	5999720	Good for him.
5999720	6002720	So, you know, he's not going to tolerate such libel.
6002720	6003720	Good.
6003720	6006720	And unfortunately, and I'm going to fully admit,
6006720	6008720	I don't know how true this is,
6008720	6010720	but I have seen this happen in the past
6010720	6014720	where 4chan and those sites,
6014720	6017720	that whole part of the internet,
6017720	6022720	pushes this fake agenda on these sites
6022720	6024720	that don't know how to do their research.
6024720	6027720	Stop getting your news from 4chan, period.
6027720	6028720	For sure.
6028720	6030720	But that's why it's not funny.
6030720	6034720	Like this is, it's racist, quite frankly,
6034720	6036720	you know, that, you know,
6036720	6040720	that Kojima gets the pin because, you know,
6040720	6042720	they don't know how to do their research
6042720	6043720	and this whole stuff.
6043720	6045720	It's just, it's disgusting.
6045720	6047720	And it's not funny,
6047720	6050720	but it's a part of gaming culture, unfortunately,
6050720	6054720	because who else would think it's funny
6054720	6058720	to misidentify Hideo Kojima as the shooter?
6058720	6060720	That was a gamer that did that.
6060720	6064720	So, but I say gamer in parentheses
6064720	6066720	because not in my circle.
6066720	6067720	You're not allowed to be a gamer.
6067720	6072720	I don't want to be a gamer if you're a gamer, quite frankly.
6072720	6075720	Mike Defton Chat says Kojima should sue.
6075720	6076720	Honestly, he should,
6076720	6077720	because this happens to people
6077720	6080720	who don't have the resources to sue sometimes.
6080720	6082720	And I wish Kojima would sue
6082720	6084720	and make an example out of it, quite frankly.
6084720	6085720	Yeah.
6085720	6087720	Dark to see it pointed out Kojima Productions
6087720	6089720	had to go so far as to put out a tweet about it.
6089720	6091720	I guess it's gross.
6091720	6093720	So, and obviously that whole situation-
6093720	6094720	It just can't with people.
6094720	6096720	Yeah, it's just, yeah.
6096720	6102720	Anyway, Questbuster says the politician
6102720	6105720	behind the information retracted it and apologized,
6105720	6107720	but the damage was done.
6107720	6108720	Yeah, I mean, once on the internet,
6108720	6109720	always on the internet,
6109720	6111720	and it's like, do your fucking research.
6111720	6113720	Don't just blast it first.
6113720	6115720	I mean, what are you, TMZ?
6115720	6118720	I mean, maybe this was the Greek version of TMZ.
6118720	6119720	I don't know,
6119720	6122720	but I guess if they can jump to conclusions, so can I.
6122720	6125720	So, I'll just say it was the Greek version of TMZ.
6125720	6126720	All right.
6126720	6128720	TMZ is such garbage too.
6128720	6130720	Yeah, but it's the exact same thing.
6130720	6131720	They'll just publish something
6131720	6135720	and not caring about the resource
6135720	6136720	or not caring about the recourse
6136720	6138720	and just to get the clicks
6138720	6140720	if they just believe it to be true.
6140720	6142720	They don't care who they hurt in the interim
6142720	6143720	as long as they get their money.
6143720	6145720	And they'll pay people to violate HIPAA
6145720	6147720	to give them the inside scoop on what's going on
6147720	6149720	at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Hollywood.
6149720	6151720	So, it's crazy.
6151720	6156720	All right, let's move on back to actual gaming news
6156720	6159720	for actual gamers, Dark Sakura.
6160720	6161720	Oh.
6162720	6167720	Xbox 360 games will no longer be a part
6167720	6171720	of the Games with Gold starting in October.
6171720	6176720	They will stop providing monthly free Xbox 360 games.
6176720	6179720	They've already sent out emails to Xbox Live subscribers,
6179720	6184720	and Microsoft said that it will continue
6184720	6188720	to give out free Xbox One games going forward.
6188720	6192720	So, yeah, bye.
6193720	6195720	Yeah, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like,
6195720	6197720	ah, bummer, but at the same time, it's like,
6197720	6201720	okay, this is the equivalent of PlayStation 3 games
6201720	6203720	still coming out for free every month.
6203720	6206720	And it's kind of like, I think the ship has now sailed
6206720	6209720	everything that is willing to be given away as part of that.
6209720	6210720	I shouldn't say given away because they do-
6210720	6211720	Well, they said they hit their limit.
6211720	6213720	Yeah, exactly, they hit their limit.
6213720	6215720	That's what it is, that the well is dry
6215720	6217720	and there is nothing else that they,
6217720	6220720	and I'm sure people still have plenty of games
6220720	6223720	they'd like to see, but the reality is they have
6223720	6227720	to pay money to get that on the service to give it away.
6227720	6230720	And there's no more agreements to be had
6230720	6232720	in the Xbox 360 space.
6232720	6235720	I'm kind of surprised they're still moving forward
6235720	6237720	with Xbox One for a little while,
6237720	6239720	but I guess that's the equivalent of PS4
6239720	6244720	and we still see new games coming out at that level.
6244720	6246720	So that'll probably still be for a while.
6247720	6249720	Yeah, that one is understandable.
6249720	6250720	Yeah.
6250720	6252720	Dr. Seuss says, I don't know if I'm misremembering,
6252720	6254720	but didn't they say you could just keep the 360 games
6254720	6257720	you did claim even if gold lapses?
6257720	6260720	Yes, because it was a limitation of the Xbox 360 system,
6260720	6262720	didn't check for that stuff.
6262720	6264720	They built it into the Xbox One and later.
6264720	6267720	So when you claim Xbox 360 games, essentially,
6267720	6269720	you don't claim them the same way either.
6269720	6270720	They kind of come through a different storefront,
6270720	6273720	but long story short, you're claiming those to your account
6273720	6276720	forever because the 360 games don't ping the server
6276720	6277720	to make sure they're still valid.
6277720	6280720	It wasn't something Microsoft had built in at the time,
6280720	6282720	but it's there now.
6282720	6285720	So, all right.
6285720	6288720	Bonstable06 says, my Game Pass expired last week
6288720	6289720	and I'm not in a rush to renew it.
6289720	6291720	Well, keep in mind, Games with Gold and Game Pass,
6291720	6293720	they are different.
6293720	6296720	For some reason, they're still different, but they are.
6296720	6297720	For now.
6297720	6299720	Unless you had Games Pass Ultimate
6299720	6301720	because Games Pass Ultimate includes
6301720	6303720	the Games with Gold and all that.
6303720	6305720	So do keep that in mind is that there is a difference
6305720	6308720	between this and Game Pass, which I know,
6308720	6310720	believe me, I think it's weird too.
6310720	6313720	They should just unify it already, but whatever.
6313720	6314720	All right, moving on.
6314720	6318720	I think about whatever is a common parlance these days.
6318720	6319720	Yeah.
6319720	6322720	All right, moving on, Lucky.
6322720	6324720	It's another bundle.
6324720	6326720	It's another itch.io bundle.
6326720	6329720	So of course, because we live in a world
6329720	6331720	where horrible things keep happening,
6331720	6334720	we're at least going to try to support people
6334720	6336720	the best way we can because we can't stop
6336720	6337720	the horrible things from happening.
6337720	6341720	In this case, in light of the Supreme Court's decision
6341720	6343720	to overturn Roe v. Wade,
6343720	6347720	there has been some fundraising done by
6347720	6350720	Caro Asserton,
6350720	6353720	who has put together a itch.io bundle
6353720	6355720	with lots of games.
6355720	6358720	I'm not sure on the exact number, but for $10.
6358720	6361720	700 creators.
6361720	6365720	So yeah, it's the indie bundle for abortion funds.
6365720	6368720	Yeah, 750 games, 600 creators,
6368720	6372720	$3,000 value for $10.
6372720	6373720	At least $10.
6373720	6376720	You're always welcome to get more money for the cause, yeah.
6376720	6381720	And I'm glad to hear that it's going to the abortion funds
6381720	6385720	because that's really where the money is needed right now.
6385720	6389720	I'll admit Planned Parenthood gets a lot of donations already,
6389720	6392720	but your local abortion funds need it more.
6392720	6395720	Yeah, so it's lots of games.
6395720	6397720	I have so many games on itch.io now,
6397720	6400720	I don't even know where to begin.
6400720	6403720	Time to start a new YouTube series.
6403720	6405720	There's so many.
6405720	6407720	Call it The Backlog.
6407720	6409720	Oh God, that could last forever.
6409720	6414720	Honestly, just The Backlog and Steam is enough to have a backlog.
6414720	6416720	Oh, trust me. Trust me.
6416720	6420720	I know. I'm sure anybody listening to the show feels there.
6420720	6424720	But at the end of the day, keep the focus not on building your backlog,
6424720	6425720	but the good cause and everything.
6425720	6428720	And it's always nice to see the gaming community and gaming creators
6428720	6433720	and indie creators really coming together for a necessary cause.
6433720	6436720	What shouldn't have to be, but is necessary in this day and age.
6436720	6440720	Yeah, I really need to pay attention to the forums on itch.io
6440720	6442720	to get my game more of these bundles.
6442720	6443720	I keep forgetting to do that.
6443720	6445720	And it's like, oh man, I would have done that.
6445720	6447720	But fine.
6447720	6448720	All right.
6448720	6454720	This last story tonight is very much a what type of story.
6454720	6457720	But I want to talk about it as somebody who is a fan of this game
6457720	6459720	and plays an awful lot of it.
6459720	6461720	Even if I don't say it in my gaming week every week,
6461720	6464720	chances are I probably played some Final Fantasy 14.
6464720	6468720	And you are probably seeing a bunch of stuff going on online
6468720	6473720	about a billboard that was recently spotted.
6473720	6475720	Yeah, this is the deal.
6475720	6479720	This was actually like an in-game group that decided to buy real life,
6479720	6484720	not in-game billboards, real life billboards
6484720	6489720	for an event that was going to be happening in Rain Nightclub.
6489720	6491720	Here's the thing.
6491720	6493720	The player housing in Final Fantasy 14,
6493720	6495720	people have gotten very creative with it.
6495720	6498720	And yeah, people run full on nightclubs in these things.
6498720	6500720	And they'll put up a Twitch stream
6500720	6504720	and they'll have like actual DJs DJing live
6504720	6508720	while characters are dancing in the housing.
6508720	6511720	And it's a thing.
6511720	6513720	And it's a thing that's gotten to this level
6513720	6516720	where we're advertising it in the real world.
6516720	6517720	So it was a, and hold on,
6517720	6520720	I got to see if I can get a picture of this billboard.
6520720	6522720	At least for those that are watching live on Twitch,
6522720	6523720	you can actually see what this looked like.
6523720	6526720	If you have, I'm sure many of you have come across this already,
6526720	6528720	but it's the Summer Bash.
6528720	6532720	And you can see it says the name of the nightclub in there.
6532720	6534720	It tells you what the Discord is.
6534720	6536720	It even says, and this would make sense
6536720	6538720	to nobody who doesn't play the game,
6538720	6542720	but it actually says we're on the Crystal Balmung server,
6542720	6545720	Ward 23, Plot 5 in Myst.
6545720	6550720	And the other interesting thing is it uses trademark stuff
6550720	6552720	like the official Final Fantasy 14 logo.
6552720	6556720	And as I understand it, this is like a Viera hairstyle
6556720	6558720	that isn't even in the game right now.
6558720	6561720	So it's like hacked out or something
6561720	6563720	to show up on this billboard.
6563720	6568720	But my, I mean, it's like the fandom has hit that level.
6568720	6571720	Two of them apparently went up in Texas
6571720	6574720	where there, I had heard rumors
6574720	6576720	they were supposed to be going up in California as well,
6576720	6578720	but I think things started,
6578720	6582720	as this got more and more coverage,
6582720	6585720	I think it kind of got pulled back a little bit there.
6585720	6586720	So-
6586720	6587720	Fandom's gonna fandom.
6587720	6588720	Yeah.
6588720	6590720	Also, by the way, Reign Nightclub apparently
6590720	6592720	also has advertised in the past,
6592720	6596720	erotic role play, ERP, if that's your thing.
6596720	6598720	And I'm not here to yuck somebody's yum,
6598720	6603720	but I mean, you don't have to put it on a billboard either,
6603720	6605720	but go off, I guess.
6605720	6609720	Show everybody that disposable income you've got right now.
6609720	6611720	So, wow.
6611720	6615720	Anyway, no word yet as to how Square Enix
6615720	6617720	may or may not be involved in this.
6617720	6619720	I don't know.
6619720	6621720	Anyway, apparently-
6624720	6625720	Oh, God.
6625720	6629720	Because you want to see how the internet does things here?
6629720	6630720	Let me see.
6630720	6631720	There's this tweet.
6631720	6633720	Reporting live-
6633720	6635720	Hold on.
6635720	6637720	Reporting live at the Free Company house
6637720	6640720	responsible for the Final Fantasy XIV billboard,
6640720	6644720	we have tanks shooting directly at the house
6644720	6646720	and Shiba's barking loudly,
6646720	6650720	and there's everybody with their tanks.
6650720	6653720	Why is there tanks in the game?
6653720	6656720	It's a mount of some sort that you can get at some point.
6656720	6658720	But the best part is,
6658720	6661720	was it the Habbo Hotel stuff?
6661720	6664720	That's a throwback to an inappropriate meme.
6664720	6666720	They have all been on Fat Chocobos.
6666720	6669720	That is, yeah, that's quite a throwback.
6669720	6671720	Fat Chocobos is the best mount.
6676720	6679720	I mean, we've been doing this for over 20 years,
6679720	6683720	and very few times on this show am I rendered speechless
6683720	6684720	where I'm like,
6685720	6686720	This is the internet.
6686720	6687720	What else?
6687720	6688720	What else is there to say?
6688720	6690720	I just think it's important to say,
6690720	6694720	please know if you've never played Final Fantasy XIV,
6694720	6697720	there is much more to the game than this.
6697720	6701720	This is just people doing what people do on the internet.
6701720	6705720	This is not the whole and the entirety of Final Fantasy XIV.
6705720	6709720	This is just people doing what people do on the internet.
6709720	6713720	This is not the whole and the entirety of Final Fantasy XIV.
6713720	6717720	Please, please don't believe all that.
6717720	6718720	Anyway.
6722720	6723720	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
6723720	6726720	The Discord post from them was amazing,
6726720	6730720	wanting to sue people for doing emote reactions.
6730720	6735720	You bought a billboard in real life.
6735720	6739720	You took the game to a real life space.
6740720	6746720	What in the actual fuck did you think was going to happen?
6746720	6748720	But people would notice.
6753720	6754720	Some people.
6755720	6757720	Oh, we're going to advertise for this thing,
6757720	6758720	but not to you.
6758720	6759720	Don't do this.
6759720	6761720	In Texas.
6761720	6762720	In Texas.
6765720	6767720	Everything's bigger in Texas.
6767720	6768720	All right.
6768720	6770720	We're going to open up this.
6770720	6772720	Including the pains in the ass?
6772720	6775720	The Discord server to your calls in the green room
6775720	6778720	over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6778720	6780720	And hey, I would encourage you to join the Discord
6780720	6782720	just to talk with us throughout the week
6782720	6785720	about all sorts of stories and things that get posted in there.
6785720	6787720	We have a call on the line.
6787720	6789720	I'm pretty sure I know exactly what this guy wants to talk about.
6789720	6791720	And it's always a pleasure to welcome into the show.
6791720	6794720	So let's get to our first call tonight.
6794720	6796720	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
6796720	6797720	Who's this?
6797720	6799720	Oh, he was on Orange Launch Radio.
6799720	6800720	Let's try it again.
6800720	6802720	He dropped into the other channel.
6802720	6803720	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6803720	6804720	Let's try again.
6804720	6805720	Who's this?
6805720	6807720	I hope that this works
6807720	6810720	because it is the one and only Ranma
6810720	6812720	and I've been having some PC issues lately.
6812720	6816720	But I would like to say to my brothers and sisters
6816720	6818720	from another mother.
6818720	6820720	Oh, we got to talk about this RePop shit real quick.
6820720	6822720	You sure do.
6822720	6824720	I don't know why I lost Loki's picture,
6824720	6825720	but while I try to get that back,
6825720	6828720	why don't you tell us what's on your mind?
6830720	6832720	It's all about the almighty dollar.
6832720	6834720	And I'll say this.
6834720	6836720	When RePop rolled in with New York Comic Con,
6836720	6837720	it was great.
6837720	6838720	It was fun.
6838720	6841720	I used to do coverage for that convention
6841720	6843720	because they wanted press outlets.
6843720	6844720	They wanted podcasters.
6844720	6848720	They want everybody to talk about this convention left and right.
6848720	6849720	And I did it for a few years.
6849720	6852720	I am already feeling the familiarity of this story.
6852720	6854720	And you heard what I had to say earlier.
6854720	6858720	And I'm already feeling, oh, I know exactly where this is going
6858720	6860720	because I've lived it.
6860720	6861720	But please continue.
6861720	6865720	And then I apply for one time and they go,
6865720	6867720	your application is rejected.
6867720	6869720	And I'm just like, the hell?
6869720	6875720	Evidently, Anime Jam Session just wasn't popular enough for them.
6875720	6880720	We don't get like one million hits a week on our site
6880720	6881720	and stuff like that.
6881720	6884720	So we were rejected.
6884720	6886720	And I said, you know what?
6886720	6888720	I'll buy a badge this year.
6888720	6890720	I will never do that again.
6890720	6894720	From that point on, I decided large conventions,
6894720	6898720	despite the genre, don't need me.
6898720	6900720	I will go to the smaller conventions
6900720	6904720	where I am appreciated for the hard work that my crew does
6904720	6907720	and it's less drama and less BS.
6907720	6911720	Now, the fact that ReadPop is rolling in here like,
6911720	6912720	we'll save E3.
6912720	6914720	Oh, we'll save E3.
6914720	6916720	Yeah, I know exactly where they're going with this, okay?
6916720	6922720	They're going to turn E3 into what they wanted to do with PAX
6922720	6924720	and it's a crying shame.
6924720	6929720	Because I tell you this, growing up reading EGM, GamePro,
6929720	6932720	I was hyped about E3, what was going on and so forth.
6932720	6936720	When y'all covered E3, I was hyped for that and so forth.
6936720	6940720	But I can see the way technology is,
6940720	6943720	all these companies doing their own thing and so forth.
6943720	6947720	In a way, there really isn't a need for E3 anymore.
6947720	6951720	I still say there needs to be one for people in the industry
6951720	6953720	because I agree with Mr. Blackwolf.
6953720	6957720	The industry needs something and GDC simply is not enough.
6957720	6960720	And as you all have mentioned previously,
6960720	6962720	when they opened this up to the public,
6962720	6965720	which they did a few years ago,
6965720	6967720	when they opened it to the public,
6967720	6969720	a lot of my cosplaying friends were like,
6969720	6971720	oh, we are going to E3.
6971720	6972720	We're going to get cr-
6972720	6974720	I'm sitting there watching.
6974720	6975720	No, you're not.
6975720	6977720	Have fun with that.
6977720	6982720	Because to these cosplayers and the typical con-goers,
6982720	6987720	they think E3 is a nonstop party from Thursday day zero
6987720	6990720	all the way to day three Sunday,
6990720	6992720	which in actuality, it is not the case.
6992720	6997720	I got to interrupt because you just made me think of a great fucking point.
6997720	7000720	You said Thursday, day zero.
7000720	7005720	That is huge right there because E3, if I recall correctly,
7005720	7008720	E3 was always a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday show.
7008720	7010720	It was in the middle of the week.
7010720	7012720	It might've been Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
7012720	7013720	No, it was.
7013720	7014720	Yeah.
7014720	7015720	It was Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
7015720	7019720	And they did that very much intentionally because this was a trade show.
7019720	7022720	It was during the work week for workers.
7022720	7029720	So here we are, sign number one, that this is not E3 as you knew it.
7029720	7034720	This is Weekend at Bernie's with Reed Pop moving E3's corpse around.
7034720	7037720	Sign number one, what you just said,
7037720	7041720	when day zero is Thursday and not, you know,
7041720	7045720	meaning that the con is actually Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
7045720	7049720	that's your first sign that this is not the same E3.
7049720	7053720	E3 experiences, dodging people and talking shop.
7053720	7054720	Sorry.
7054720	7055720	Sorry, Rama.
7055720	7058720	I don't mean to interrupt you, but you just made me inadvertently think of a,
7058720	7061720	Oh, this is, that is a huge thing right there.
7061720	7062720	Thursday's not day zero.
7062720	7064720	Monday's day zero.
7064720	7065720	No, you are right.
7065720	7069720	I think I was coming down to the end and for some of us in on the con side,
7069720	7073720	day zero means you'll pick up your badge and you go back to the rooms and you
7073720	7077720	start pre-gaming. Okay. I don't think.
7077720	7080720	That is Dragon Con Thursday. Well, no, actually now it's Wednesday.
7080720	7082720	Cause Wednesday's the new Thursday. But anyway.
7082720	7089720	I don't think E3 is ready for a bunch of semi buzz drunken people just rolling
7089720	7093720	through playing these games and bitching and moaning and complaining.
7093720	7097720	No, I, no, but in the long run,
7097720	7100720	they're not going to care because they got their money, you know?
7100720	7104720	And I'll tell you this now with this pandemic,
7104720	7108720	a lot of conventions are out here throwing GoFundMes and so forth,
7108720	7112720	trying to make ends meet so they could survive a following year because of
7112720	7113720	all the fees.
7113720	7116720	AX ain't doing that. They got their money.
7116720	7121720	They basically have people in the industry handling that and all of their
7121720	7125720	guests, their companies, they basically told them, well,
7125720	7128720	since you are the sponsors,
7128720	7131720	you take care of the guests and you take care of all of that.
7131720	7134720	You just give us the money. You have your tables.
7134720	7138720	Y'all do the rest. And I can see RePop pulling the same through,
7138720	7142720	same thing with E3 going to Intel,
7142720	7146720	going to AMD, going to Nintendo, all of them. Yes.
7146720	7152720	I do understand that Intel and AMD doesn't really need to be at E3 per se,
7152720	7156720	but they are the backbone of the gaming and the technology.
7156720	7158720	So they're going to court them anyway.
7158720	7159720	Intel's been there before.
7159720	7163720	That's how I got a motherboard for Final Fantasy back from the Final Fantasy
7163720	7164720	contest.
7164720	7167720	Yeah. They do like the PC gaming showcase thing.
7167720	7172720	Yeah. When Kensha Hall was a thing and E3 died with Kensha Hall.
7172720	7174720	Well, they were, it wasn't even in Kensha Hall.
7174720	7178720	It was in the main hall that they did their PC gaming showcase thing.
7178720	7181720	I thought they had a thing in Kensha Hall for a while, but yeah. Yeah.
7181720	7184720	I do remember AMD being there at one point too. So anyway, but anyway,
7184720	7185720	I digress.
7185720	7189720	And I'm telling you, if y'all go to E3 2023.
7189720	7190720	Well, we won't.
7190720	7194720	And you walk in and you see an arrow that says,
7194720	7200720	this way to Dealers Hall and Artist Alley, that's it.
7200720	7203720	Game over because that's how they're going to make their money.
7203720	7205720	But on the plus side, you can go to E3,
7205720	7210720	come out with some nice swag that you bought, you know, just saying.
7211720	7214720	You can, you can finally tell all your friends, you went to E3,
7214720	7218720	a show that died in 2017, the year they opened it up to the public.
7220720	7223720	Or what out? That's all I got to say is pour one out.
7224720	7226720	Back in the day when they used to like,
7226720	7230720	wouldn't even let all the media in because there was too many people coming.
7231720	7234720	I remember when I went to E3,
7234720	7238720	it was right before everything was opened up to the public and we had to
7238720	7241720	submit writing samples for DDR Freak.
7242720	7245720	To get us in qualified as media.
7246720	7248720	We had to be published on the website.
7249720	7252720	I remember when we were, I remember when we were doing this show,
7252720	7257720	but the guy that ran the network that we were on gave the E3 badge to a relative instead.
7260720	7264720	Rob, that's kind of shameless. I'm proud of you.
7268720	7270720	What? Nothing.
7274720	7276720	That was some hot tea right there, my friend.
7278720	7279720	Anyway.
7282720	7283720	Uh, where were we?
7284720	7290720	Oh, we're sitting here enjoying some nice Earl Grey hot, discussing Reed Pop.
7290720	7292720	That's what we were doing.
7292720	7296720	And Mr. Rob Roberts took himself the biggest pour of that tea.
7296720	7297720	God damn, that was delicious.
7297720	7301720	I have a lot to say when it comes to E3. I can't help it. I have a lot of feelings.
7302720	7304720	This is why we're here.
7309720	7313720	Anyway, how many people got COVID at Anime Expo? Let's change the subject.
7314720	7316720	We haven't heard anything yet.
7316720	7320720	I have not heard anything yet, which is completely and totally shocker.
7320720	7324720	And I will say those photos that everybody saw at AX of the crowds,
7324720	7329720	that was the first 15 minutes of day one from what I have been told.
7329720	7332720	That's what the Nintendo's Hall used to look like before they opened the doors.
7332720	7334720	Because that's pretty much the same thing as what that was, right?
7334720	7336720	It was before they actually opened the doors.
7336720	7338720	But still, I mean, justify it however you want,
7338720	7342720	but you still had all those people packed in there for 15 minutes. It's not a good look.
7342720	7347720	But what's interesting is if you had a VIP or Premiere badge, you went through a separate entrance.
7349720	7351720	Of course. Of course.
7351720	7355720	Man, listen, don't miss big events like that. I'll be honest.
7356720	7365720	Rob, we're at a point where people are basically scalping anime convention badges, anime convention concert tickets, and so forth.
7365720	7372720	They were doing that for E3 a lot. You'd give somebody your badge for the last day and nobody cared.
7372720	7376720	Nobody was checking IDs or anything like that until they realized they probably should.
7377720	7384720	I am from that generation where, you know, you bought a badge to a con.
7384720	7389720	You walked up the street to Kinko's, paying a couple of bucks for a color photocopy.
7389720	7391720	You cut it out and hand it to a friend and be like, there you go.
7391720	7396720	Because the staff didn't care as long as they saw the badge and looked like an actual badge.
7399720	7401720	That's true. That's true. You know what?
7401720	7407720	A lot of those conventions have like outsource security or like, you know, going through like temp agency security.
7407720	7411720	And I know this firsthand at a convention that I went to.
7411720	7414720	I'm not sure if I should. What the hell? It's that kind of night.
7414720	7418720	It was Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest in Vegas at the Paris.
7418720	7428720	A friend of mine paid security to get into the show, even though he couldn't get a badge because badges had been sold out for, you know, they got sold out in five minutes.
7428720	7430720	He really wanted to go. He tried to get a badge online.
7430720	7435720	He was like, you know what? I'm going to go and I'm going to pay a security guard to let me in. Fucking worked.
7435720	7439720	Because they don't pay their security enough and they outsource it.
7439720	7448720	That's true. I know people who have bought bootleg Comic-Con badges that still work with the RFID tags.
7448720	7452720	Okay. All right. And I'm telling you this now.
7452720	7465720	When E3 2023 rolls around and RePop will say, you know, we're doing it for the public, within not even 15 minutes, you will see eBay listings for those badges.
7465720	7470720	You will hear the people complain. And you know what RePop is going to do?
7470720	7479720	They're just going to count their money and be like, well, I'm really sorry this has happened, but good luck next time, you know, as they count them dollars.
7483720	7490720	And I know it wasn't here bashing this company, but you know what? We're not really bashing this company. We're speaking the truth here.
7490720	7495720	We're talking from our own personal experiences where this company really don't care because they got their bottom line.
7495720	7504720	There's a reason why I know people who worked at RePop that started Comic-Con and the anime convention left and did their own thing.
7504720	7506720	And we're pretty good with it.
7506720	7509720	We didn't boil the tea. We just served it.
7509720	7510720	Yup.
7510720	7512720	It's piping hot.
7514720	7519720	Anyway, let's see. Anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?
7519720	7522720	Oh, no. Oh, no. That's it.
7522720	7530720	You want me to spill anything else tonight? Because apparently once you hit that 20 year mark as a podcast, I need that thing for my mug or something.
7530720	7538720	I need a coffee mug that says too old to give a fuck because that's clearly where I've hit at my 20 year mark.
7539720	7549720	I've said this countless times on my own show and to other people. I completely, as the song goes, I'm completely out of fucks to give.
7549720	7556720	As long as I can get up every day and live my life, do what I have to do and collect my paycheck, we go there.
7556720	7564720	It's like the picture, behold the field in which I grow my fucks. Lay thine eyes upon it and see that it is barren.
7565720	7570720	And I will say I love the preaching from the pulpit tonight. Loved it. Loved it.
7570720	7574720	I'm waiting for the collection plate to go around one more time so I can throw some more bits in there.
7574720	7583720	You know, Reverend Rob, Reverend Loki and Reverend Jamie. Preach on. Preach on.
7583720	7587720	Welcome to the PTL podcast network.
7588720	7594720	The Church of Orange Lounge Radio. A lot of day gamers, OK?
7594720	7600720	PTB. Pay them biddies. Get you one step closer to that E3.
7601720	7603720	That's going to suck anyway.
7603720	7604720	Too much metal for one hand.
7604720	7605720	All right.
7605720	7610720	Rama, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can, I don't know, spill some more tea. We'll see what happens.
7610720	7612720	All right. Take care of my friend.
7612720	7613720	Take care too.
7613720	7614720	All right. Bye.
7614720	7615720	Bye.
7615720	7618720	You know what happens when you spill the tea that's too hot?
7618720	7621720	Someone's going to get burned.
7623720	7626720	I might for opening my big mouth tonight, but you know what?
7627720	7630720	I didn't say anything that wasn't true.
7630720	7632720	You didn't. You did not.
7632720	7636720	So if the truth bothers you. Sorry to hear that.
7636720	7643720	Well, on top of that, if you see something and you think someone's talking about you, well, if the shoe fits.
7645720	7646720	Just saying.
7647720	7651720	Or even if the shoe doesn't fit, perhaps you need a shoe horn.
7652720	7659720	Either you think everything is about you or you're guilty about something. That's it.
7660720	7665720	Anyway, let's see. Do we have anything in the mail bag?
7665720	7666720	No.
7666720	7669720	OK, well, here's the real tea.
7669720	7674720	I swear we're getting rid of that segment if we don't get some emails on a regular basis.
7674720	7679720	Or I guess let me ask this. Let me let me let me say instead of making threats because I'm in that kind of mood tonight.
7679720	7682720	I do love the listeners. I love all of you that show up every week.
7682720	7684720	I love those of you that listen to the podcast feed.
7684720	7688720	And I know there's many of you that listen and you never say a thing to us.
7688720	7692720	And that's that's OK. You know what? Lurkers are fine. We still love you.
7692720	7695720	How would you all like to interact with this program?
7695720	7699720	What could we do? And especially like the live folks.
7699720	7703720	I'm here in them because we got the chat. We got the calls. We got all that.
7703720	7709720	How would the people on the podcast feed like to be heard? Because I'm I'm feeling like emails ain't it.
7709720	7711720	How would the people. Yeah. Go ahead.
7711720	7715720	If you want to tweet something and have me read it.
7715720	7720720	Just tap. Just do a hashtag orange lounge radio.
7720720	7722720	Send it to at OLR.
7722720	7726720	I was like, I can give you the log in for OLR. I should have a long time ago and you can just.
7726720	7730720	Well, I mean, but if you if you do use the hashtag, I'll see it anyway.
7730720	7731720	No, that's true.
7731720	7738720	So use the hashtag, you know, or yeah, just Orange Lounge Radio or OLR.
7738720	7743720	You know, hopefully it won't be mixed in with like some other group called OLR.
7743720	7748720	But we get we get weird shit that's like for some school, some some private school.
7748720	7755720	Do it for Orange Lounge Radio. Just one word and I'll see it and I'll read it and judge you.
7755720	7760720	I mean, listen to your opinions very, very seriously.
7760720	7764720	All right. Folks in chat, dark to see us as bring back the Twitter segment. All right.
7764720	7768720	Done. We will. You got it. Twitter segment.
7768720	7770720	Your tweets at OLR.
7770720	7773720	I'll use it. Yeah.
7773720	7780720	All right. Yeah, we'd love to. I mean, I know I might be sound like I'm not trying to sound mean or there's just I know we really we really want to hear from people.
7780720	7784720	It's every where every gamer has a voice and, you know, trying to get more voices here on the air.
7784720	7791720	So, yeah, I know tweets are probably easy emails. I think the reality is how often do I send emails anymore?
7791720	7800720	I said the show roll out like if I look at my sandbox in my email, it's like the last 12 weeks of show rolls and maybe one other little thing mixed in here and there.
7800720	7802720	Like there's very little that I email.
7802720	7817720	Did I send I mean, I my email at work is a different story, but I have so many mail rules set up to put stuff in trash to archive other stuff, to move it into other folders, to save my receipts to another folder.
7817720	7822720	You know that I actually had a clean inbox.
7822720	7825720	Because of my mail rules.
7825720	7828720	If you don't know how to use mail rules, learn. It's great.
7828720	7831720	Bobby Blackall says Rob sent me stuff about Dragon Con.
7831720	7837720	Yeah, because, you know, for the fourth year in a row, they didn't want to process our credit card.
7837720	7839720	I just can't stop talking tonight.
7839720	7842720	But that originally came in on emails.
7842720	7844720	So, yeah, I just forwarded the email. It's easy.
7844720	7851720	But yeah, if I really want your attention, Bobby, I just go to Discord like I usually do.
7851720	7857720	So, easiest way to send IMs back and forth or if people, people, people, Twitter.
7857720	7859720	People sit on Discord more often these days.
7859720	7862720	Twitter is actually a great place to get a hold of me, quite honestly.
7862720	7863720	I do use Twitter too much.
7863720	7870720	And I'm very happy that Twitter is not going to end up turning to the dark side after all.
7870720	7872720	Thank God, Lex Luthor.
7872720	7874720	We all knew this would happen. Fucking.
7875720	7882720	And Bobby, I am sure that people understand sarcasm and if not, oops.
7882720	7886720	Yeah. Yeah, hopefully people get our sense of humor by now.
7886720	7890720	But just to be clear, we're really nice. We promise.
7890720	7895720	First of all, we don't get new people. Sometimes we do.
7895720	7896720	We do.
7896720	7902720	I really, I really want to, would like to have some new blood.
7902720	7905720	It will be nice to get back out to events again.
7905720	7908720	You know, California Extreme is a thing.
7908720	7914720	I really am biting my tongue on something because it's coming soon here locally.
7914720	7916720	And I'm going to just bite my tongue on that.
7916720	7917720	I'll talk to you off air about that.
7917720	7919720	But that's something.
7919720	7924720	And then, you know, getting to go to Dragon Con and see people there again.
7924720	7929720	It's just be nice to get out and talk about the stuff we like again.
7929720	7931720	TwitchCon will be huge too, I think.
7931720	7937720	All right, let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.
7937720	7939720	Nope, nothing.
7939720	7940720	Fair enough.
7940720	7944720	Well, I think we're getting towards the end of the show then.
7944720	7947720	So this is the part of the show where we go around and check on final thoughts.
7947720	7951720	Thank you so much for participating with the show tonight.

8013720	8014720	Look at that.
8014720	8015720	Dozilla.
8015720	8017720	Been listening to the show since 2006.
8017720	8019720	Don't think I've ever chatted.
8019720	8020720	Welcome, Dozilla.
8020720	8021720	Welcome.
8021720	8022720	I am happy to see you chatting.
8022720	8024720	That legit made me smile.
8024720	8025720	Thank you for that.
8025720	8026720	I really appreciate that.
8026720	8027720	You know what?
8027720	8028720	You know what?
8028720	8029720	You know what?
8029720	8030720	Hold on.
8030720	8031720	Hold on.
8031720	8032720	Hold on.
8032720	8033720	I'm going to do a thing.
8033720	8034720	Okay.
8034720	8035720	There we go.
8035720	8036720	I'm doing a thing now.
8036720	8037720	Okay.
8037720	8038720	All right.
8038720	8039720	There you go.
8039720	8040720	There you go.
8040720	8041720	Dozilla.
8041720	8042720	The thing has been done.
8042720	8043720	Is it Dozilla or Dozilla?
8044720	8046720	Thanks, DarkSakura.
8046720	8047720	That's nice.
8047720	8050720	Now you can go back and catch up on all the videos from prior weeks.
8050720	8052720	There you go.
8052720	8053720	Love that.
8053720	8054720	All right.
8054720	8055720	Let's go.
8055720	8056720	Okay.
8056720	8057720	Dozilla.
8057720	8058720	Noted.
8058720	8059720	Okay.
8059720	8060720	I was right.
8060720	8062720	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8062720	8066720	So, DarkSakura can go Zilla and do her DBD stream.
8066720	8067720	So, DarkSakura.
8067720	8068720	Go, Godzilla, go.
8068720	8070720	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
8070720	8072720	What's your final thought tonight?
8073720	8081720	I am trying so hard to hit 500 followers that it's like I have seven people to go.
8081720	8082720	I'm so close.
8082720	8083720	You got this.
8083720	8084720	So, wish me luck.
8084720	8085720	You got this.
8085720	8089720	It's just going to take that right raid to land at the right time.
8089720	8090720	So, I hope you get it tonight.
8090720	8092720	I've been getting stranger raids and that's been-
8092720	8093720	That's great.
8093720	8095720	Not hate raids, like actual real people raids.
8095720	8096720	Good, good.
8096720	8097720	All right.
8097720	8098720	Well, I'm ready.
8098720	8099720	All right.
8099720	8100720	Take care, DarkSakura.
8100720	8101720	We'll see you next week.
8101720	8102720	We'll see you later tonight and then next week.
8102720	8103720	All right.
8103720	8105720	Loki, your final thought for us tonight?
8105720	8110720	I'm only 13 away from 500 subscribers on my YouTube channel.
8110720	8112720	So, that'll happen eventually.
8112720	8113720	Okay.
8113720	8118720	I feel bad because I passed 500, but I've had my account since it was just in TV.
8118720	8121720	So, I've had a long time to build that up.
8121720	8123720	So, in all fairness, yeah.
8123720	8126720	So, I'm waiting for 1,000 now.
8126720	8128720	We'll see, but I have to stream more to do it.
8128720	8132720	My final thought is, unfortunately, like it's going to be a lot harder to stream this week.
8132720	8137720	I have a really big high profile thing at work and I have to commute to another office to do it.
8137720	8139720	So, but I mean, it's great.
8139720	8140720	I love my job.
8140720	8141720	I love what I do.
8141720	8146720	I love this opportunity, but it's going to cut into my evenings a little bit because I'm not going to be getting home until 7, 7.30 at night.
8146720	8149720	And then by the time I get home, it's like, okay, eat dinner, go to bed.
8149720	8153720	So, yeah, but it'll be a good week.
8153720	8155720	So, but I hope I get to play some games.
8155720	8163720	Probably a lot of location games because I'll get to play location games in a new town while I'm waiting for the traffic to die down.
8163720	8165720	So, all right, that's it, everybody.
8165720	8167720	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8167720	8168720	Thank you for being here.
8168720	8170720	Have a wonderful week, everybody.
8170720	8171720	We'll see you next time.
