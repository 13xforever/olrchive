WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Twitch is currently testing a feature that could allow any streamer, or at least more

00:14.000 --> 00:18.360
of them, to centrally collect donations that are sent directly to a charity of that streamer's

00:18.360 --> 00:21.760
choosing instead of pooling donations into a streamer's personal control and taking

00:21.760 --> 00:23.700
their word that they're doing the right thing.

00:23.700 --> 00:28.280
With mass appeal and application also comes more opportunities for mass or targeted scamming.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.640
This episode is not raising funds for charity.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.640
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, to tell you more

00:33.640 --> 00:36.440
about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

00:36.440 --> 00:39.200
where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.960
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:44.960 --> 00:47.040
where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.040 --> 00:55.220
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 923 of our

00:55.220 --> 00:59.560
show for tonight, July the 24th of 2022.

00:59.560 --> 01:04.360
After being unexpectedly off last week, I had COVID.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.360
It's just that simple.

01:05.360 --> 01:11.340
I tested positive Sunday morning, and it was the faintest of faint line.

01:11.340 --> 01:15.420
In fact, it was that whole thing where I sent it to a friend, and my friend was like, oh,

01:15.420 --> 01:16.880
I've done this with pregnancy tests.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.180
You play with the contrast and the lighting, and you can see when you do that that there's

01:20.180 --> 01:21.180
a line there.

01:21.180 --> 01:22.300
And I was like, great.

01:22.700 --> 01:28.380
The exhaustion really started to take its toll, and yep, so whomp, whomp.

01:28.380 --> 01:33.760
It finally got me after two and a half years, but I'm feeling marginally better as of yesterday,

01:33.760 --> 01:34.860
so I am back.

01:34.860 --> 01:37.620
So I'm happy to be back, and I'm back with my co-host.

01:37.620 --> 01:40.220
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:40.220 --> 01:41.220
Hi.

01:41.220 --> 01:43.180
Hi, how are you?

01:43.180 --> 01:44.820
I may have a sinus infection.

01:44.820 --> 01:46.420
Well, that sucks.

01:46.420 --> 01:48.180
Those aren't contagious.

01:48.180 --> 01:49.800
No, they're not contagious.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.800
That's the good thing.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.800
We have a lot of activity at my house.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.800
Well, you know we're converting our garage.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.600
Yeah, because you got the car that was in there.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.720
You had a classic car in there, and you got that out because you're going to allow that

02:08.720 --> 02:11.800
to be the second half of your pinball expansion now, right?

02:11.800 --> 02:12.800
Well, no.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.800
It is where all the pinballs have been moved to, all but three, so everything's outside.

02:16.800 --> 02:22.120
Dan got black and gray carpet tiles that honestly aren't that great, but they look good, and

02:22.120 --> 02:25.800
made the Space Invader on our floor.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.800
Oh, that's clever.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.800
Okay.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.800
And the walls are black with blue LED strips going around the room, and he's mounted a

02:31.800 --> 02:38.920
TV, and we've got all the rest of the pins out there, of course, except for Black Knight,

02:38.920 --> 02:45.920
World Cup, and Theater of Magic, and we have a living room again.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.040
And we have couch and chairs that we got at La-Z-Boy.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.040
Yeah.

02:49.040 --> 02:53.040
If you all had seen JV's house before, there was pinball machines out back, there was pinball

02:53.040 --> 02:56.040
machines in a secondary bedroom, there was pinball machines in the living room.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.040
Air pin, air pin, everywhere a pinball.

02:58.040 --> 03:05.040
But it was like any gamer nerd, even if you're only just a casual pinball enjoyer, you'd

03:05.040 --> 03:07.040
be like, wow, this is rad.

03:07.040 --> 03:11.040
And I've invented a new term, dust kittens.

03:11.040 --> 03:14.040
Oh, is that what was growing behind your pinball tables?

03:14.160 --> 03:18.160
It's what happens when you have a cat and dust.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.160
Oh, yeah.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.160
You don't have dust bunnies, you have dust kittens.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.160
Oh, yeah.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.160
No, that was living in my old computer for sure.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.160
I swept up another cat.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.160
Oh, my gosh.

03:27.160 --> 03:34.160
So that's what's been going on in my house, and now we can actually sit on a couch and

03:34.160 --> 03:37.160
watch a TV and play a game or thing.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
Nice.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.160
Nice.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.160
Yeah.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.160
All right.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.160
Well, also-

03:42.160 --> 03:43.160
I feel like an adult again.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.280
Hey.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.280
Hello.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.280
Hi.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.280
I hope you enjoyed the spontaneous week off.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.280
Sure.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.280
Were you able to get in more Minecraft?

03:52.280 --> 03:55.280
Because I saw you pushed a Minecraft video this week.

03:55.280 --> 03:59.280
So I was like, oh, maybe Loki had time to edit another video.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.280
Well, no, I did that this week.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.280
Yeah, but yeah, not last weekend.

04:03.280 --> 04:07.280
Last weekend was probably just messing around with something.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.280
I don't remember.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.280
Gotcha.

04:09.400 --> 04:15.660
I see tonight, I was going to add, because we do tape live at twitch.tv slash a vog network

04:15.660 --> 04:19.480
every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby

04:19.480 --> 04:25.180
Black Wolf show, which by the way, happy birthday, Bobby Black Wolf, a young 17 years old.

04:25.180 --> 04:26.500
The show, not the host.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.880
The show is 17 years old as of tonight.

04:30.880 --> 04:34.340
As I tell Bobby every year, happy birthday.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.340
Always a pleasure-

04:35.340 --> 04:36.340
He was try 29.

04:36.340 --> 04:37.340
Yes.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.400
We're going to be on stage with you on Sunday nights, but respect your elders.

04:41.400 --> 04:49.160
All right, but so of course, as we do tape live on Twitch, I'm sorry the podcast feed

04:49.160 --> 04:54.120
can't see our lovely faces, but you can see if you subscribe over a vog network with like

04:54.120 --> 04:58.080
your free Amazon prime subscription or whatever, you can access the video archives and watch

04:58.080 --> 05:00.400
whatever episodes you want.

05:00.400 --> 05:04.080
But the Loki always has a video of a game playing behind him.

05:04.080 --> 05:09.500
And tonight I recognize this one as a game everyone's talking about this week.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.940
This is stray, is it not?

05:10.940 --> 05:12.380
Or is it some predecessor game?

05:12.380 --> 05:17.220
I occasionally like to showcase games that I've purchased and yet will have no time to

05:17.220 --> 05:18.220
play.

05:18.220 --> 05:25.100
So this is my latest purchase that I will not have time to play.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.100
Eventually we'll get there.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.100
Okay.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.100
That sounds good.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.500
But yeah, it's a very popular and streaming right now.

05:30.520 --> 05:35.520
A lot of my favorite Dead by Daylight streamers have taken a...

05:35.520 --> 05:38.000
It's interesting because now they're getting sidetracked with all these other games.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Some of them are playing a Video Horror Society, which was called VHS for short.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.520
I don't know why they...

05:45.520 --> 05:48.080
Actually because VHS has already been taken by another game.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.280
Oh, I didn't know that.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.280
Okay.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.280
They put that up on their Twitter.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.280
Oh, I didn't know that.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.280
All right.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.880
So now they have Video Horror Society, which obviously everybody's still calling it VHS

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
for short.

05:57.880 --> 05:58.880
Yeah.

05:58.880 --> 05:59.880
I see that one a lot.

06:00.880 --> 06:04.220
There was another scary game that came out recently that everybody was doing for a hot

06:04.220 --> 06:06.540
minute and now Stray.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.980
Now they're all doing Stray.

06:07.980 --> 06:13.540
So everyone was doing Elden Ring for a minute and then everyone was doing The Quarry.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.540
The Quarry.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.540
Yeah.

06:15.540 --> 06:16.540
Of course.

06:16.540 --> 06:17.540
That's the horror game I was trying to think of.

06:17.540 --> 06:18.540
Everybody did The Quarry for a week.

06:18.540 --> 06:19.540
It was great.

06:19.540 --> 06:20.540
Yeah.

06:20.540 --> 06:21.540
Yeah.

06:21.540 --> 06:22.540
So now it's Stray, but Stray looks really fun.

06:22.540 --> 06:27.180
I don't know how I feel about the stealth mechanics, but the physics and the way that

06:27.180 --> 06:31.280
they've done the cat and everything is really, it's really adorable.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.280
I want to pick it up.

06:32.280 --> 06:36.180
I'm just not sure if I should get it on PlayStation or if I should get it on PC because you've

06:36.180 --> 06:37.180
seen these mods.

06:37.180 --> 06:38.180
It runs better on PlayStation.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.180
Oh, okay.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.180
Okay.

06:40.180 --> 06:42.320
But you've seen the mods on PC, right?

06:42.320 --> 06:46.360
People were posting about that to our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.960
People will post inspirational topics for the night.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.920
And somebody was asking, when are we going to get a Mr. Smoosh mod?

06:51.920 --> 06:55.960
Well, number one, I don't do 3D graphics, that fancy stuff.

06:56.020 --> 07:00.780
Nobody has to do it for me, but I wouldn't complain if someone did.

07:00.780 --> 07:01.780
But don't forget Cheddar.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.880
Can we have an AB switch or something?

07:03.880 --> 07:08.700
And while you're at it, you might as well do Minda and our classic OLR cats of the past

07:08.700 --> 07:09.700
too.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.020
So, you know, Sanrio.

07:11.020 --> 07:13.460
You just need to put Shermie in a wheelbarrow.

07:13.460 --> 07:14.460
Yeah.

07:14.460 --> 07:15.460
So might as well get them all.

07:15.460 --> 07:19.020
Shermie was not agile in her later years.

07:19.020 --> 07:24.060
How long until we get someone modding a dog in instead?

07:24.060 --> 07:25.060
That's blasphemy.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.600
I'm literally hearing Cheddar in here, like as I'm talking about him, but I'm looking

07:29.600 --> 07:30.960
behind me and I don't see him.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.960
I'm like, what in the world?

07:31.960 --> 07:35.080
Like, did Loki turn the volume up on that video somehow?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.080
What is that?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.080
No.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.080
It's cats in the wall.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.080
Yeah, I guess so.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.080
My gosh.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.080
He's found his way into the wall.

07:41.080 --> 07:45.440
Well, it's not uncommon for him to yell, yell loudly in Alan's office, which is on the other

07:45.440 --> 07:46.440
side of the wall.

07:46.440 --> 07:52.400
But anyway, let's talk a little bit about our kickoff topic tonight, which really, in

07:52.400 --> 07:57.100
kind of looking through the news, I didn't see any stories that were gigantic stories.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.820
So I thought we could start tonight by kind of recapping some of the news from last week,

08:00.820 --> 08:02.660
because there was quite a bit of news last week.

08:02.660 --> 08:08.860
By the way, hello to our live Twitch chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

08:08.860 --> 08:13.260
Mike Defton chat talking about me being out with COVID saying, yeah, it eventually caught

08:13.260 --> 08:14.500
up to all of us.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.900
Not everyone's had it yet, but it's making the rounds.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.980
But good thing that vaccines are a thing.

08:19.980 --> 08:25.080
Yeah, obviously I had the double vaccine, the single boost.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.800
I didn't qualify for the double boost.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.480
I probably should have just got it anyway, but I'm trying to be a good boy and look how

08:30.480 --> 08:31.480
that treated me.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.480
Yeah.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.720
My wife keeps bugging me about that.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.220
But my booster was all the way back in November, right?

08:38.220 --> 08:43.780
But anyway, honestly, I thought it was going to be a lot worse than it was, but it hits

08:43.780 --> 08:45.560
and I'm not trying to belittle it.

08:45.560 --> 08:50.040
I'm just saying probably because of vaccines and the fact that because I've made it no

08:50.040 --> 08:52.380
secret on this show, I have diabetes.

08:52.380 --> 08:56.700
So because of that, I qualified for Paxlevid, even though I'm in my forties and not over

08:56.700 --> 08:58.420
65.

08:58.420 --> 09:03.320
We all know President Biden got COVID as well, and he went on Paxlevid because of his age.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.060
So I qualified for Paxlevid because of diabetes.

09:06.060 --> 09:11.980
And I think that was probably part of what was holding off my symptoms because the treatment

09:11.980 --> 09:13.060
cycle finished.

09:13.060 --> 09:14.620
So you're on Paxlevid for five days.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.320
That finished yesterday morning was my last dose.

09:17.320 --> 09:21.120
Now tonight, I'm starting to feel a little bit of congestion again.

09:21.120 --> 09:27.580
Like I'm going to try to push through best I can, but if I call it, you'll all know why.

09:27.580 --> 09:32.360
But I feel like this could have been a lot worse.

09:32.360 --> 09:38.280
Well, when I had swine flu years ago, and that was far worse, but I didn't have a vaccine

09:38.280 --> 09:39.280
for swine flu.

09:39.280 --> 09:45.860
So anyway, Dijarama says, did you drink any Pedialyte as well?

09:45.860 --> 09:49.020
Gatorade zero and vitamin water, like similar stuff.

09:49.020 --> 09:53.260
So I have to make sure it's not too sugary because I can't drink regular Gatorade, but

09:53.260 --> 09:54.460
I can drink Gatorade zero.

09:54.460 --> 09:57.020
So I will do that.

09:57.020 --> 09:59.520
So let's see.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.900
Also some folks talking about Stray but with a dog.

10:02.900 --> 10:06.620
Tiger class says, well, if they could, if they want to make a sequel with a dog, dog

10:06.620 --> 10:08.420
gameplay would be more frantic though.

10:08.420 --> 10:16.040
I guess they've already put CJ from Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas in it, so we've anything's

10:16.040 --> 10:17.040
possible now.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.400
Gosh, I saw you just linked that in our chat room.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.400
That's funny.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.400
Yeah.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.600
Mike Deaf says, I'm glad it was pretty much like a cold when I went through it.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
Yeah.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.600
For me, it was fatigue.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.600
Like I did not.

10:26.600 --> 10:30.320
It was interesting because people were giving me advice on, oh yeah, you get a sore throat

10:30.320 --> 10:31.800
and this, you know, make sure you have lozenges.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.520
I never had really a sore throat.

10:33.520 --> 10:37.100
I had a throat tickle, but not a sore throat.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.520
fatigue was the huge thing.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.440
Like I felt like I permanently had taken a Tylenol PM.

10:42.440 --> 10:47.320
And just even the point where like holding up my phone to text people, like my arms would

10:47.320 --> 10:51.280
get sore and I'd be like, I just want to put them down on the bed and go back to sleep.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.580
So that's what it was for me.

10:53.580 --> 10:54.580
It's horrible.

10:54.580 --> 10:58.880
That mod not only changes the model to make the cat look like CJ, but it makes all the

10:58.880 --> 11:05.320
cats like human, like someone stretched a cat skin onto a person.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.380
It's just so wrong.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.020
That's a little creepy.

11:10.020 --> 11:12.060
All right.

11:12.060 --> 11:17.420
I thought for our kickoff topic tonight, we could recap some of the news from last week

11:17.420 --> 11:21.260
and some of the big headlines that we missed because we were unexpectedly off.

11:21.260 --> 11:23.640
We'd originally planned to do a show, but it didn't happen.

11:23.640 --> 11:27.780
So some of the big headlines from last week, Bayonetta 3 finally got a launch date and

11:27.780 --> 11:29.620
it is this year, which is pretty exciting.

11:29.620 --> 11:35.520
It's going to be launching on October 28th, which is a little sooner, I think maybe than

11:35.520 --> 11:37.800
some folks had anticipated.

11:37.800 --> 11:41.400
Y'all excited about Bayonetta 3 coming out in October, just in time for Halloween?

11:41.400 --> 11:45.140
If it's even more over the top, yes.

11:45.140 --> 11:46.140
Let's hope.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.140
Let's hope.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.240
I wonder if this isn't going to be the last one.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.140
I think the Bayonetta games are great.

11:51.140 --> 11:55.800
I hope it's not the last one, but a lot of things run in trilogies, right?

11:55.800 --> 11:57.140
It very well could be the last one.

11:57.140 --> 11:58.140
So we'll see.

11:58.140 --> 11:59.140
We'll see.

11:59.660 --> 12:01.100
It took them a while to make this one too.

12:01.100 --> 12:06.420
They're going to be putting out a physical Switch edition of Bayonetta 1, sort of to

12:06.420 --> 12:08.180
couple with that.

12:08.180 --> 12:12.180
There was a digital version of Bayonetta 1 already available if you bought Bayonetta

12:12.180 --> 12:17.140
2, but you would have Bayonetta 2 on the cart and the Bayonetta 1 digital.

12:17.140 --> 12:23.460
So a physical Switch edition for the collectors is coming later this year, but it's currently

12:23.460 --> 12:24.460
undated.

12:24.460 --> 12:26.860
A new multiplayer Kirby game was announced.

12:26.860 --> 12:30.380
Kirby's Dream Buffet is coming out.

12:30.380 --> 12:31.980
So that's kind of neat.

12:31.980 --> 12:33.580
You mean like every dream I ever have?

12:33.580 --> 12:37.140
Yeah, it's a Kirby Dream Buffet.

12:37.140 --> 12:44.660
If I were Kirby Dark Sakura and I inhaled your dream, what power would I get?

12:44.660 --> 12:46.940
You don't want to know.

12:46.940 --> 12:52.620
You do not want to know, especially with the weird-ass nightmares I've been having lately.

12:52.620 --> 12:55.940
So anyway, it's food-based obstacle courses.

12:55.940 --> 13:01.660
You collect strawberries as Kirby grows, and then you fight on a floating platform.

13:01.660 --> 13:07.260
It seems a little fall guys to me maybe, like just a little, but it seems like maybe a little

13:07.260 --> 13:09.460
bit fall guys to me.

13:09.460 --> 13:15.540
But yeah, I'm sure especially Mike Deft is going to be excited to hear that there's another

13:15.540 --> 13:16.540
Kirby game.

13:16.540 --> 13:18.420
So there you go.

13:18.420 --> 13:23.500
Mike Deft in chat says, fuck the haters who say it's too soon for another Kirby game.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.980
You know what?

13:24.980 --> 13:25.980
How about Mario?

13:25.980 --> 13:28.300
Like there's always going to be side adventures and things like that.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.580
Kirby's just one of the Nintendo mascots now.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.300
So there is that.

13:32.300 --> 13:37.700
An article was also going around that Nintendo Japan does recognize the same-sex marriages

13:37.700 --> 13:40.100
of their employees despite Japanese law.

13:40.100 --> 13:44.900
So just a lot of people tipping their hat and saying kudos to Nintendo Japan for recognizing

13:44.900 --> 13:45.900
that.

13:45.900 --> 13:49.580
Again, this is all the news from last week that we weren't able to get to while we were

13:49.580 --> 13:51.140
out.

13:51.140 --> 13:55.820
One that had people talking quite a bit, especially in our discord, there was a lot of chat about

13:55.820 --> 14:02.540
this, and that was the fact that Nintendo acquired a CG animation studio, Dynamo Pictures,

14:02.540 --> 14:06.980
and they're going to be rebranding themselves as Nintendo Pictures.

14:06.980 --> 14:12.920
This deal will be finalized on October 3rd, and then Dynamo Pictures in Nintendo's statement

14:12.920 --> 14:19.700
will be, quote, focused on development of visual content utilizing Nintendo IP.

14:19.700 --> 14:24.080
Now this has a lot of people kind of going, oh, well, is this because they're making a

14:24.080 --> 14:28.920
Mario movie with, I think it's what Imagination, the people that do the Minion movies, or making

14:28.920 --> 14:34.300
the Mario movie, and Nintendo wants to branch out and do their own movies and more.

14:34.300 --> 14:39.720
I don't think it's really that, because if you look at Dynamo Pictures' resume, they've

14:39.720 --> 14:47.760
already worked on some things, such as Pikmin short movies, Metroid Other M post production,

14:47.760 --> 14:52.080
Monster Hunter World motion capture, and they actually did work on Death Stranding, which

14:52.080 --> 14:55.560
isn't Nintendo, and so on and so on.

14:55.560 --> 15:01.280
They're not really in the business of making feature length films, and there is quite a

15:01.280 --> 15:02.280
difference.

15:02.280 --> 15:08.600
However, I think this probably lends itself to that there is probably some games that

15:08.600 --> 15:13.160
Nintendo is working on for the Switch that we don't know about yet, where they want to

15:13.160 --> 15:20.600
do some epic cut scenes, and perhaps that is a Mario game, perhaps, but this could be

15:20.600 --> 15:21.600
something else as well.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.600
Or a Zelda game.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.900
It very well could be a Zelda game, but they're already doing it for a Metroid game, maybe

15:26.900 --> 15:27.900
another Metroid.

15:27.900 --> 15:30.380
We know Metroid Prime 4 is a thing, right?

15:30.380 --> 15:34.000
Maybe they are being contracted to work on some more cut scenes for that.

15:34.000 --> 15:40.780
So I kind of think it's for more in-house development for the games, and I wouldn't

15:40.780 --> 15:44.240
forecast that suddenly Nintendo wants to get into movies.

15:44.240 --> 15:48.880
I'm pretty sure their agreement, whatever they have with Illumination, probably would

15:48.880 --> 15:54.000
get in the way of that anyway, but I mean, never say never.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.960
They could always expand and hire more people and do new things, but I think whatever they

15:58.960 --> 16:03.960
do is probably going to be limited to Nintendo's platform.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.120
You know what they could do?

16:05.120 --> 16:09.520
If you want to hear my tinfoil hat theory, and who doesn't love to hear a Rob Roberts

16:09.520 --> 16:10.640
tinfoil hat theory?

16:10.640 --> 16:12.600
You already?

16:12.600 --> 16:18.780
What they could do is maybe try to create some short movie content, and I mean shorts,

16:18.780 --> 16:25.040
and I mean think about on the 3DS system when you could download countless episodes of Dinosaur

16:25.040 --> 16:28.640
Office on the 3DS shop.

16:28.640 --> 16:32.120
But what if there were maybe short movies, I'm not talking about Dinosaur Office, but

16:32.120 --> 16:36.520
maybe something with like Pikmin, I don't know, or one of the other cute Nintendo franchises

16:36.520 --> 16:42.840
where they could give away episodes on Nintendo Switch online with expansion pack, and maybe

16:42.840 --> 16:49.740
creating kid-friendly programming like Nintendo flicks, basically.

16:49.740 --> 16:52.840
Not something, and I don't want you guys to think big picture with that, I'm not saying

16:52.840 --> 16:57.120
Nintendo's going to launch a Netflix competitor, but I'm saying what if kind of in their own

16:57.120 --> 17:03.440
little bubble, just their own little short amount of trickled content?

17:03.440 --> 17:09.580
That I think would be the tinfoil idea for me, is not a feature length movie, but maybe

17:09.580 --> 17:15.320
creating a variety of shorts for distribution on Nintendo's platform.

17:15.320 --> 17:18.600
And Tiger Claw on chat says they've done that before, remember the animated short for

17:18.600 --> 17:20.200
Star Fox Zero?

17:20.200 --> 17:24.200
Yes, so I could see something like that being a thing.

17:24.200 --> 17:28.240
So don't think Nintendo Movie, because they've got the partnership with Illumination for

17:28.240 --> 17:29.240
that.

17:29.240 --> 17:32.120
And if it's, you know, if many people are reading into the fact that the Mario movie

17:32.120 --> 17:36.880
is simply seeding a Donkey Kong movie and a Nintendo multiverse at some point, based

17:36.880 --> 17:40.680
on what's happening at the theme parks, you can bet that Illumination is probably doing

17:40.680 --> 17:42.760
the Donkey Kong movie as well.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.720
So this is going to be for something different.

17:44.720 --> 17:51.600
It's probably for the games, but it could be like, not even the Switch, I would say

17:51.600 --> 17:56.280
the Switch's successor, and building up some type of library of content for that.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.680
Or what about their theme park or something like that?

17:58.680 --> 18:01.280
They could be doing animation for a ride or something.

18:01.280 --> 18:06.280
Again, I feel like since Universal licensed it from Nintendo, Universal would ultimately

18:06.280 --> 18:09.480
be responsible for that and they would probably leverage Illumination to do it.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.480
I don't know.

18:10.480 --> 18:15.240
We'll just see what they do and then be disappointed by it.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.240
Sounds good.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.240
All right.

18:17.240 --> 18:21.920
Let's just think about what was the key thing in animation 10 years ago?

18:21.920 --> 18:24.160
And then that's probably what they're doing.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.160
VR.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.160
Oh, they're getting the VR.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.160
There we go.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.160
Yeah.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.160
There we go.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.160
VR.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.160
3D movies.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.160
Or 3D TVs.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.160
Yes, 3D movies.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.160
3D movies and 3D TVs.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.160
That's what it is.

18:37.160 --> 18:43.040
Although, to be fair, Loki, Nintendo actually was on the edge of that because of the 3DS.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.040
Yes, yes, yes.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.040
Until they stopped.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.880
Until those movie carts never came out.

18:47.880 --> 18:53.400
Remember when we saw Tron Legacy on a Nintendo 3DS and then it never actually came out?

18:53.400 --> 18:55.720
Yeah, they didn't have very many movies.

18:55.720 --> 19:00.440
The only one I remember was the Tekken animated movie was in 3D.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.440
Yeah.

19:01.440 --> 19:06.040
I remember when they were showing off major motion pictures on those cartridges and for

19:06.040 --> 19:07.520
whatever reason it-

19:07.520 --> 19:16.400
It was up there with, what was it, the UH, not UHD, it was, oh gosh, I don't remember-

19:16.400 --> 19:17.400
HD DVD?

19:17.400 --> 19:18.400
Is that what you're thinking of?

19:18.400 --> 19:19.400
No, no, no, no, no.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.400
Oh, no, no.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.400
No, you're thinking too big.

19:21.400 --> 19:27.000
God, I don't remember what Sony used to call their stupid PSP discs.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.320
The UMDs, says Pod Culture in chat.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.320
UMDs, thank you.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.320
Yes.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.320
UMDs.

19:32.320 --> 19:33.320
Yeah.

19:33.320 --> 19:37.200
It was on the cusp of the UMDs, you know, they were going to tackle that market like

19:37.200 --> 19:42.160
they did with Game Boy video or Game Boy Advance video.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.160
Hey, Game Boy Advance-

19:43.160 --> 19:44.160
Actually, those are really popular.

19:44.160 --> 19:50.200
I was going to say, you joke, but you could get a Pokemon episode or two or a Nickelodeon

19:50.200 --> 19:55.640
cartoon crammed into a Game Boy cart and you could shut your kid up for a ride to the grocery

19:55.640 --> 19:58.400
store, so it's something.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.040
All right.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.040
That's so funny.

20:01.040 --> 20:05.160
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I still have the Green Lantern trailer in 3D on my 3DS.

20:05.160 --> 20:10.280
I wonder, what are y'all holding on to on your DS that you're never going to delete?

20:10.280 --> 20:12.280
I'm so curious.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.280
Anyway-

20:13.280 --> 20:17.760
Actually, I think I gave my old DS to Julian.

20:17.760 --> 20:25.120
If my battery hadn't died, I'd probably still have the Meteos E3 demo on my DS.

20:25.120 --> 20:31.420
All right, anyway, moving on to some other headlines we missed last week.

20:31.420 --> 20:33.600
PlayStation is going to be launching a loyalty program.

20:33.600 --> 20:38.880
It's called PlayStation Stars, and you will get rewards by doing different things within

20:38.880 --> 20:39.880
PlayStation.

20:39.880 --> 20:44.480
It really sounds like a version of Microsoft Points, which Microsoft's been leveraging

20:44.480 --> 20:49.940
for some time, but PlayStation will be doing this with their own system, and maybe if you

20:49.940 --> 20:54.200
are the first person to unlock a platinum trophy, you might get some extra stars for

20:54.200 --> 20:55.200
that.

20:55.200 --> 20:59.120
You get some loyalty points, which we'll redeem in a catalog, and again, you might be able

20:59.120 --> 21:04.640
to actually just fund your PlayStation Plus account with that, so it might be a good way

21:04.640 --> 21:07.580
to kind of help pay for itself.

21:07.580 --> 21:12.880
There were some early rumors that this was going to be NFTs, and in an interview with

21:12.880 --> 21:18.840
the Washington Post, Sony Interactive Entertainment advertising VP Grace Chen went on record and

21:18.840 --> 21:22.200
said, it's definitely not NFTs.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.200
Definitely not.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.960
You can't trade them or sell them.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.560
It's not leveraging any blockchain technologies.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.560
Not NFTs.

21:29.000 --> 21:37.840
Very, very, very clear, very explicit statement from Sony on that, but I don't know who thought

21:37.840 --> 21:38.840
that was NFTs.

21:38.840 --> 21:44.520
It just, again, it just sounds like Microsoft's program, but remodeled for Sony.

21:44.520 --> 21:50.160
Anyway, this was what I was really hoping to talk to Dark Soccer about last week until

21:50.160 --> 21:51.720
COVID got me.

21:51.720 --> 21:58.680
There is a Genesis Mini 2 that has been confirmed for release in the US on October 27th, and

21:58.680 --> 22:01.680
they've got some bangers in here.

22:01.680 --> 22:07.440
They've got Mega CD this time, including Final Fight CD, Lunar, Eternal Blue, and Lunar the

22:07.440 --> 22:09.460
Silver Star.

22:09.460 --> 22:16.900
They've got Alien Soldier, Spatter, Tatsujin, Super Street Fighter II, the new challengers.

22:16.900 --> 22:20.320
This is a very neat little console, and I was thinking about it.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.680
And of course, I was like, well, Dark Soccer is probably going to be like, I already have

22:22.680 --> 22:23.760
all of these.

22:23.760 --> 22:24.760
But then-

22:24.760 --> 22:25.760
I do have most of them.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.760
I'll be honest.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.760
But still, the charm is going to be hard to resist.

22:29.760 --> 22:37.280
No, no, no, no, I, Dan and I did get the other one.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.720
So this one could also happen.

22:39.720 --> 22:40.720
We'll see.

22:40.720 --> 22:41.720
Yeah.

22:41.720 --> 22:42.720
Yeah.

22:42.720 --> 22:47.240
Many folks in chat speaking up on that one, Dark2CSA and Sega CD stuff, Digirama S says

22:47.240 --> 22:51.520
Lunar alone is worth the price, and SHO 100 Matt says, oh, yes, the Genesis Mini 2 is

22:51.520 --> 22:53.200
going to be day one for many of us here.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.200
Yes, yes.

22:54.200 --> 22:58.840
Oh, by the way, speaking of 3DS titles, you're never going to delete a great answer from

22:58.840 --> 23:03.800
our voiceover man, the VX Jason XV, who says, I'm holding on to Theatrhythm because it's

23:03.800 --> 23:04.800
fun.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.800
Curtain call, naturally.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.800
So much better than the original.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.800
Yes, yes.

23:07.800 --> 23:12.400
Well, hold that thought because we have another kind of related-ish story a little later in

23:12.400 --> 23:13.400
the show.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.720
Just hold that thought.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.680
Anyway, some other news from last week.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.680
Let's see.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.440
Oh, this is not good.

23:20.440 --> 23:24.480
Data leaked out of Bandai Namco because there was a ransomware attack with that.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.480
Whoops.

23:25.480 --> 23:30.840
Konami, though, apparently going to be relisting Metal Gear titles that had previously delisted.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.040
Did you all remember that Metal Gear titles got delisted?

23:34.040 --> 23:35.040
Yeah.

23:35.040 --> 23:40.100
I think most people forgot, but I do remember when it happened.

23:40.100 --> 23:44.000
And then in the Arcade Archive series, Dragon Saber came out from Namco.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.280
So that came out as well.

23:46.280 --> 23:51.560
And then a game that Loki has talked about on this show previously, Fashion Police Squad

23:51.560 --> 23:56.760
gets its official release August 15th on the PC, but later on consoles.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.600
Hey, it looked kind of fun.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.480
I was very curious about that one.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.480
So I wanted to try that.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.320
There's a demo if you want to check it out.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.800
Oh, that's great.

24:05.800 --> 24:10.040
Bobby in chat says, that was the Metal Gear delisting due to the archive historical footage.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.760
Yes, that was.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.560
It really was like a year ago at this point.

24:13.560 --> 24:14.560
It really feels like.

24:14.560 --> 24:17.440
So it's interesting that now you're coming back.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.440
All right.

24:18.440 --> 24:22.640
Loki, did you see anything you wanted to touch on that I missed for Dark Soccer?

24:22.640 --> 24:28.280
I don't remember if it was last week or whatever, but Ubisoft delisting a bunch of their titles

24:28.280 --> 24:32.240
that they're still selling for like they were like this was during the steam sale.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.760
They were like selling a bunch of their Assassin's Creed Far Cry three.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.120
That was all that stuff was.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.140
Yeah, that was being delisted off of there.

24:40.140 --> 24:45.300
So basically that you wouldn't be able to if you bought the game, you can't download

24:45.300 --> 24:51.300
it again and you can't access the DLC, which is weird, really irritating.

24:51.300 --> 24:54.940
And a lot of these games are single player games.

24:54.940 --> 24:59.740
And the fact that you can't get the DLC for it and stuff, it's just really annoying.

24:59.740 --> 25:06.300
So yeah, yeah, yeah, I definitely saw the social media updates on all that last week.

25:06.660 --> 25:12.460
I don't understand why they couldn't just like, you know, just put it out for free.

25:12.460 --> 25:17.020
Like you're you're delisting them anyways, just say, OK, for this like few weeks, we're

25:17.020 --> 25:18.860
going to make it free like those games.

25:18.860 --> 25:23.820
They're super old anyways, like just offer that all for free so everybody can download

25:23.820 --> 25:28.100
it and then you'd get a bunch of goodwill.

25:28.100 --> 25:32.460
And then people would, you know, they remember like, oh, hey, thank you for all those free

25:32.460 --> 25:33.520
games, Ubisoft.

25:33.560 --> 25:37.840
Have you addressed these, you know, sexual misconduct of your employees at your company?

25:37.880 --> 25:39.480
And they'd say, no, of course not.

25:39.480 --> 25:40.680
Why would we have done that?

25:40.680 --> 25:43.400
Have you held the East Kuma accountable yet for anything?

25:44.480 --> 25:49.160
Exactly. So, you know, we will when the other company is.

25:49.400 --> 25:49.720
Yeah.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.840
Dartusia says, I know they've given away AC games before.

25:54.840 --> 25:59.280
So, yeah, I guess speaking of giving away games, I don't think it's on our showreel

25:59.280 --> 26:04.320
tonight, but did you see like Anthem, a GameStop you can get for a penny now?

26:05.240 --> 26:08.000
But yeah, you can get Anthem, a GameStop for a penny now.

26:08.120 --> 26:13.840
I mean, they've given away this game so many different ways, like it's on game.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.960
But it was free to play.

26:14.960 --> 26:15.840
It's not free to play.

26:16.440 --> 26:20.840
I think you could get a retail version of it, though, for a penny if you want.

26:21.240 --> 26:26.880
So it's yeah, the glory days of Anthem never happened.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.320
Anyway, pretty much.

26:29.320 --> 26:33.120
And how many of us were like, how many of us told them so?

26:33.440 --> 26:35.480
Yeah, I know. I was thinking I'm sorry.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.240
Well, for some reason, I was thinking Anthem, I was thinking the

26:39.840 --> 26:42.320
there's the other game, not Anthem.

26:44.040 --> 26:46.120
Gosh, I can see the game, but I can't think of the game.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.400
And it's not Destiny.

26:48.400 --> 26:53.480
No, the one, the one by the the one by the Titanfall devs, I can't remember.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.640
It's Apex Legends.

26:55.080 --> 26:58.960
I was thinking Apex one when you said Anthem, you know, both start with an A.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.080
So yeah, Apex really essentially the same.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.120
No, no. Oh yeah.

27:03.120 --> 27:06.200
And Anthem, yeah, Anthem for a penny.

27:07.200 --> 27:11.080
And no, my dev says if it comes with a box,

27:11.080 --> 27:13.560
that's a good way to get replacement cases for other better games.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.240
That is true. A good tip.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.200
What's it? What's what's the trade in value on that?

27:19.240 --> 27:21.760
Like, comment, subscribe for more tips. All right.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.480
What can I trade that in for it at GameStop?

27:24.480 --> 27:27.880
I bet it's probably only a penny if it's if it's the one

27:27.880 --> 27:30.040
that's just the game in the little paper envelope.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.080
I bet if they actually have a box, it's probably ninety nine cents.

27:35.080 --> 27:38.200
All right. Let's talk about what games we have been playing this week

27:38.200 --> 27:39.520
that probably aren't Anthem.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.520
Let's talk about some other games we've been playing this week

27:41.520 --> 27:43.440
in a segment we call Appropriately.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.800
How was your gaming week?

27:44.800 --> 27:45.960
Dark Soccer, we'll start with you.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.840
How was your gaming week?

27:48.640 --> 27:51.880
I have played Final Fantasy six.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.280
And well, I'm still playing Survivor.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.760
I don't think I've seen you play killer in a week.

28:02.680 --> 28:06.440
I was really in and out of it this week, so I played killer

28:06.920 --> 28:11.080
a week and a half ago, and it ended up being like an LOL game

28:11.080 --> 28:13.440
because I was just trying to get a doctor achievement done.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.960
And I made friends again.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.640
That's cool. But I don't know what it is, but like

28:20.520 --> 28:24.760
I can have full and as a survivor thing, I don't know what it is.

28:24.760 --> 28:29.600
Maybe it's the fact that I've played all killer for so long. But.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.760
Even if I can't make friends with the killer,

28:34.640 --> 28:36.200
you know, like in game,

28:36.200 --> 28:38.640
I can at least have a moment of communication with them

28:38.640 --> 28:40.840
and see if they will try to be friends.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.280
You know what I mean? So.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.800
It's just it's silly.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.880
It's all silliness.

28:47.880 --> 28:51.120
But I've been enjoying myself and Finara has been

28:51.480 --> 28:53.880
not only my my meat shield,

28:55.320 --> 28:58.040
but also now my accountant.

28:59.240 --> 29:03.240
Because she's keeping track of my my

29:04.840 --> 29:07.840
what's it called the the tome stuff achievements.

29:09.400 --> 29:13.800
And and. And I've really appreciated that,

29:13.800 --> 29:17.400
although I'm stadia hunters is kind of weird for

29:17.440 --> 29:19.360
because that's where stadia achievements go.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.880
And I need to just find like a straight up list that I can put

29:22.880 --> 29:25.400
on the spreadsheet myself so that it's easier for me to track.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.920
But I did make a couple of accomplishments.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.640
I have adapted every survivor that is adaptable,

29:32.000 --> 29:35.040
including freaking Ash. Wow.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.720
Oh, the David one was given to me.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.320
The Laurie one was given to me.

29:41.320 --> 29:42.440
I'm like, bless you.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.720
Just like the nurse one was back in the day. Lucky.

29:44.720 --> 29:48.120
And so, you know, there's like the special generators, right?

29:48.480 --> 29:51.960
Like the one in the

29:51.960 --> 29:55.680
asylum and the one in the church and freaking ring light.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.640
But I've gotten now all of the special generators done.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.080
Nice. That's great.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.040
Yeah, you can you can.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.760
It's probably the exact same list of steam's achievements.

30:07.760 --> 30:11.520
So if you need a table steam has that, this doesn't. Oh, interesting.

30:12.280 --> 30:15.000
Yeah. Is it related to the Stranger Things content?

30:15.040 --> 30:17.640
Because some of them change. Not at all. Oh, weird. OK.

30:17.840 --> 30:21.040
I mean, it would be possible because I mean, for anyone

30:21.040 --> 30:24.600
who got the Stranger Things achievements, they're off your list on steam.

30:24.640 --> 30:29.720
Interesting. And they're completely gone from from stadia hunters,

30:30.680 --> 30:34.880
which is basically where stadia outputs all of their achievement stuff to.

30:36.120 --> 30:39.760
But I have one hundred and fifty one out of a hold on.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.120
I've got the number right here.

30:41.160 --> 30:45.600
I have one hundred and fifty one out of one hundred and ninety six.

30:46.280 --> 30:50.920
Wow. And as of now, I've played for seven hundred

30:51.360 --> 30:54.240
and seventeen hours and fifteen. Wow.

30:55.680 --> 31:00.480
Yeah, press still significantly longer than other people, but I've

31:01.280 --> 31:04.640
well, I'm maybe three and a shorter than a lot of my friends.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.120
Yeah, that way.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.160
But on the plus side,

31:09.160 --> 31:13.040
it is. Yeah, and like Mike says, I now can play both.

31:14.040 --> 31:19.200
But I think that I'm actually a pretty decent Nia player now.

31:19.200 --> 31:23.800
And the one thing that restricts me is that my mouse,

31:23.800 --> 31:26.760
I have to use a thumb track ball, so I can't look behind me.

31:27.520 --> 31:31.560
And I don't like to use a controller because it hurts my wrist after a while.

31:32.280 --> 31:37.680
But I have found that every so often, all I have to do is just do that number,

31:37.680 --> 31:40.520
spin the ball, and I'll do a perfect 360 on somebody.

31:41.880 --> 31:42.480
That's funny.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.640
Did you and I was to say, Deidre, I mess and chat says,

31:46.640 --> 31:50.320
sounds like Jamie logged more hours in DVD than your average persona five player.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.800
Yes, I know people over 3000 hours.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.400
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.680
Easily, easily.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.480
I've been playing for like a year, a little over a year.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.080
I know people who play since the game freaking came out and played it religiously.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.440
Yeah. Anything else for a game a week?

32:08.360 --> 32:11.240
Um, I played my word game.

32:12.640 --> 32:17.840
And, oh, I played like this woodblock puzzle game that I used to play a while back.

32:17.840 --> 32:21.200
It's the sort of like where you have the shapes of blocks

32:21.200 --> 32:23.040
and you have to fill them in to fill the whole thing up.

32:23.680 --> 32:26.400
Kind of like what Tetris was based off of.

32:26.400 --> 32:30.080
I played a little bit of that just because, like, I needed to wake up my brain

32:30.080 --> 32:32.440
and that's what did it that day.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.160
Brain training.

32:33.960 --> 32:37.040
Yeah, except like more spatial awareness.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.840
So, yeah, gotcha.

32:38.840 --> 32:42.400
My gaming week because of Covid, honestly, didn't do a lot.

32:42.400 --> 32:44.360
I was really, really exhausted.

32:44.360 --> 32:46.920
And like I was yeah, I was even too tired to game.

32:46.920 --> 32:50.360
Like I watched some people play like DVD on Twitch and stuff,

32:50.360 --> 32:51.840
but that was about the extent of it.

32:51.840 --> 32:55.560
Now, when we got closer to the weekend and I was getting my energy back,

32:55.560 --> 32:57.640
I did play a little bit of No Man's Sky.

32:57.640 --> 33:00.760
I did a stream of that the other night because they did a new patch,

33:01.360 --> 33:03.120
which I think is story slotted later in the show.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.080
So we'll give you the details then.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.320
But they did a Twitch drops campaign to go with it.

33:07.320 --> 33:10.720
So I was streaming Friday night, just a new game,

33:10.720 --> 33:13.240
just messing around with a new game for some drops.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.440
I actually got a good amount of new viewers thanks to that,

33:16.440 --> 33:21.560
because people streaming No Man's Sky will raid other people playing No Man's Sky.

33:21.560 --> 33:25.560
So the drop trains kind of continue for the people that are lurking in the chat.

33:25.560 --> 33:28.000
So because I did that, too, I raided somebody I didn't know.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.920
I was streaming until like two in the morning on Friday.

33:30.920 --> 33:34.720
I never go that late, but I was like, I have a second rush energy here.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.880
So I raided somebody in Australia because I was like,

33:36.880 --> 33:41.200
well, nobody that I know is still streaming at this point, that's for sure.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.800
But yeah, I was having fun playing No Man's Sky.

33:43.800 --> 33:47.280
And then I've been playing a little bit of DBD because of all the changes

33:47.280 --> 33:48.720
that would affect.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.040
I've been exploring that a little bit because, you know,

33:51.040 --> 33:53.000
it kind of mix things up.

33:54.280 --> 33:57.640
I never I never liked using Dead Hard anyway.

33:58.440 --> 34:01.080
I realized it was overpowered. I probably should have been.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.280
I just never liked it as a perk.

34:03.280 --> 34:06.480
I was when I adopted David, I was going to have it on.

34:06.720 --> 34:10.160
But yeah, I was always a fan of Overcome, Jonah's perk.

34:10.160 --> 34:12.040
And that's what a lot of people,

34:12.040 --> 34:14.320
people have either switched to that or sprint burst.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.440
But I've noticed as killer, you can really shut sprint burst down

34:18.440 --> 34:19.960
by running fear monger,

34:19.960 --> 34:22.520
which causes people to be exhausted when they touch a generator.

34:22.520 --> 34:26.040
So I have seen a big surge in fear monger. Yeah.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.680
So and I didn't use my pig build at all.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.200
And it's still pretty solid.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.520
I've also seen a lot more of Gearhead.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.560
I've seen more make your choice.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.160
I've seen, oh,

34:42.440 --> 34:44.520
what's the hex people are using?

34:45.040 --> 34:46.840
Devour Hope a lot, actually.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.640
Interesting. I haven't seen that one a lot.

34:48.640 --> 34:51.560
But there's there's a few interesting videos I watched.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.600
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.640
And I've been just watching, you know, some buddy streamers stream

34:56.640 --> 35:01.000
that game a little bit and just otherwise kind of haven't been doing a lot.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.080
I did get out yesterday and today and I played a little bit of Pokemon Go

35:05.080 --> 35:08.360
and I played a little bit of Ingress and the usual stuff that I play out in the,

35:08.400 --> 35:10.840
you know, out in real life.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.440
I wish I'd thought to ask Shane to call in tonight

35:13.440 --> 35:15.760
because he was at Pokemon Go Fest in Seattle.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.160
He's on the road home now, I'm pretty sure.

35:18.160 --> 35:22.400
But he he, you know, he was not feeling very good on Pokemon Go.

35:22.400 --> 35:26.360
I don't remember if he trashed it on this show or if it was a stream of mine

35:26.360 --> 35:28.240
where because, you know, we buddy up a lot when I stream.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.480
But he was not feeling it.

35:30.480 --> 35:35.040
He uninstalled the game at some point and suddenly he got back into it

35:35.040 --> 35:38.400
and went to Pokemon Go Fest and he had a lot of great things to say about it.

35:38.640 --> 35:42.040
And he said he got 58 shinies across the weekend because

35:42.520 --> 35:43.720
because of course he did.

35:43.720 --> 35:46.360
Of course, he did. It's Shane.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.080
Shane is the shiny one. Yes, yes.

35:49.080 --> 35:52.920
His name in the game is literally shiny hunter, you know, his name.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.840
So it's funny. So. All right.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.480
I'll see. Maybe I can get him to call in later in the show or something.

35:59.480 --> 36:03.120
But in the meantime, let's get into some of the news from this week

36:03.600 --> 36:04.600
that's been going on.

36:04.600 --> 36:09.000
So, Loki, we start tonight with a game that you really love, right?

36:10.040 --> 36:13.040
Yeah. And also, I played Minecraft this week.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.360
So did I skip your week? I'm sorry.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.280
I didn't mean to do that.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.800
It's OK. Just Minecraft this week.

36:21.520 --> 36:24.280
We did finally hit 500 subscribers, so that's great.

36:24.280 --> 36:28.400
You just finally a week later unlocked my community features now

36:28.400 --> 36:32.680
so I can post non-video updates, polls and all that fun stuff

36:32.680 --> 36:35.000
so I can interact with the community.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.920
So I'll just keep on going.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.440
That's really great. Congratulations. Thank you.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.040
But yeah, now we let's get into the news, so.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.720
All right. How did I blame?

36:45.720 --> 36:47.080
Blame COVID. We'll just blame COVID.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.280
That's what I've done all week.

36:48.280 --> 36:52.720
Yeah. Let's talk about everyone's favorite topic, and that is NFTs.

36:52.720 --> 36:57.240
So Mojang came out, I guess, and addressed

36:57.760 --> 37:02.160
some of the issues with NFTs, mainly because there's been folks

37:02.160 --> 37:06.080
and we've talked about this in like previous weeks where they were using

37:06.080 --> 37:10.480
Minecraft as like a source of like NFTs to basically

37:12.080 --> 37:15.040
they're selling skins or they were selling

37:16.160 --> 37:19.480
seeds to worlds, which is stupid.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.640
I don't know why you would pay for that, but

37:22.640 --> 37:25.200
all of that was done by other people.

37:25.200 --> 37:28.600
So they basically put out a long statement saying that, listen,

37:28.600 --> 37:33.240
our policy on NFTs is that we don't like it and we are

37:33.760 --> 37:36.240
not allowing you to make

37:36.960 --> 37:41.680
blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our Microsoft

37:41.680 --> 37:46.200
or a Minecraft client and server applications, nor may they be utilized

37:46.200 --> 37:49.800
to create NFTs associated with any in-game content,

37:49.800 --> 37:53.320
including world skins, persona items and other mods.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.520
So basically saying, stop it, knock it off.

37:57.640 --> 38:00.560
So that's good, at least that they're, you know, behind that.

38:00.560 --> 38:03.960
I didn't realize people were doing that, creating like a house

38:03.960 --> 38:06.560
or an art piece in Minecraft and NFTs.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.960
You know, it's the bare minimum nonsense that they do.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.920
Like they'll take a skin and they'll like randomize colors on it

38:12.920 --> 38:15.200
and stuff like that and sell it as an NFT.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.600
Like we saw that before they were doing that.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.760
And it was annoying and stupid.

38:19.760 --> 38:23.040
And this this goes back to the point I was saying when we yelled

38:23.040 --> 38:26.640
about NFTs earlier and my message to the crypto bros

38:26.640 --> 38:31.000
who are very invested in NFTs and want these to are really pushing

38:31.000 --> 38:34.800
these as a new thing, people we know and have worked with in the past,

38:35.000 --> 38:37.240
really trying to push this NFT thing.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.760
And I'm like, you know what?

38:38.760 --> 38:42.080
Like people are not going to buy into NFTs

38:42.080 --> 38:47.680
until the rampant thievery and underground BS is stopped.

38:47.680 --> 38:49.520
Like it's always going to be associated with this

38:49.520 --> 38:52.920
until something actually legitimate comes around.

38:52.920 --> 38:56.320
And like this doesn't help the fact that there are all these NFTs

38:56.320 --> 38:58.920
of the bear that are just Minecraft asset ripoffs.

38:59.120 --> 39:03.680
Like this is this is a rampant problem in both of the mobile phone stores.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.480
Anyway, is that, you know,

39:05.480 --> 39:09.400
Minecraft clones galore that look just like, you know, Minecraft and so forth.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.520
And this this is just another thing where it's like you barely

39:13.520 --> 39:17.160
did the bare minimum and it just it just reeks of thievery.

39:17.480 --> 39:22.600
So I'm sure now it didn't people threaten to go make their own game.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.200
Like, oh, then we've minecraffle this, too.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.120
We'll just steal all their assets and make our own game.

39:28.880 --> 39:33.200
I mean, I don't know if they've threatened thievery, but like, yeah,

39:33.320 --> 39:35.520
I mean, they've tried to do that with different things.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.200
Congratulations on threatening to do the thing that every other game

39:40.200 --> 39:43.040
company has been thinking about since Minecraft got popular.

39:46.480 --> 39:48.520
Yeah. So think about it.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.680
Think about it. You're threatening to do the thing.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.800
Every other game company wants to do, and that's find

39:53.800 --> 39:56.160
Minecraft's lightning in a bottle and apply it.

39:56.320 --> 39:59.840
And I would say probably the only thing I can think of that's close

39:59.840 --> 40:02.960
is either something like Stardew Valley, which is really,

40:03.280 --> 40:06.960
you know, or Terraria, which are both very distanced from Minecraft.

40:06.960 --> 40:11.360
They're just, you know, or I would say the Dragon Quest

40:12.120 --> 40:16.760
builders is probably the closest thing that you can really feel the Minecraft

40:16.760 --> 40:19.840
in it that like actually kind of works. So.

40:21.520 --> 40:27.200
VXJ6V in chat says, NFTs are 2020 fan character palette swaps. Yep.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.240
Yeah, that's pretty accurate.

40:30.240 --> 40:34.480
Mike Deft in chat says, By the way, did you see that GameStop NFT

40:34.480 --> 40:38.200
was selling art that was pretty much taken from a 9-11 photo?

40:38.880 --> 40:41.120
Yeah, I saw that.

40:41.120 --> 40:45.760
But that's because I'm not defending it, but it's a symptom of

40:45.760 --> 40:50.240
isn't the GameStop NFT marketplace just a free for all eBay type of thing?

40:50.680 --> 40:53.440
Like it's not exactly restrictive, right?

40:53.440 --> 40:56.840
Like nobody is quality checking the shit they're putting up there, right?

40:57.240 --> 40:59.640
So of course that happened.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.720
Of course, yeah, it's it's yeah, it's a mess.

41:02.720 --> 41:06.760
But I did want to mention, though, on the flip side of that.

41:08.560 --> 41:14.240
Another company that is very much into NFTs is Square Enix.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.960
And so, of course, Square Enix had

41:17.960 --> 41:23.520
put out they're going to be doing like some Final Fantasy seven NFTs.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.160
And despite the fact that, you know,

41:28.200 --> 41:31.960
I don't know if people are necessarily happy about that, I would say probably not.

41:33.960 --> 41:38.000
There's, I guess, some action figures that they're selling now.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.400
It says they're doing active action figures and collector cards

41:42.760 --> 41:44.800
are going to have NFTs bundled with them.

41:44.840 --> 41:47.960
So if you buy them, you're going to get like digital versions of those

41:48.440 --> 41:50.720
that will come alongside them.

41:50.920 --> 41:55.400
So they're they're trying to legitimize it

41:55.400 --> 42:00.000
by pairing it with something that people it's it's like the the movie.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.280
What was the movie everybody?

42:01.280 --> 42:02.960
And you got an NFT when you went and saw the movie.

42:02.960 --> 42:04.640
It was Spider-Man or something, right?

42:04.640 --> 42:08.440
Like people, they're trying to sneak NFTs in so that people

42:08.440 --> 42:11.800
kind of start building a collection and then they want to make a thing.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.400
But it's like, hmm.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.480
Well, here's the thing, too, like the figure,

42:15.480 --> 42:18.040
you can buy the figure for one hundred and thirty dollars

42:18.040 --> 42:21.320
or they have a version that includes the digital copy alongside it for one

42:21.320 --> 42:23.280
hundred and fifty dollars.

42:23.280 --> 42:29.720
And then that's not even coming out until apparently November 2023.

42:30.760 --> 42:33.400
How about so? So, you know.

42:35.200 --> 42:39.960
I don't even know, like, do we know what we're going to be doing in 2023?

42:39.960 --> 42:43.280
I mean, like I could just completely break down by then

42:43.280 --> 42:45.360
or like nobody might be interested in that stuff.

42:45.360 --> 42:50.320
At the end of the day, if people want to buy these, then I guess fine.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.960
It doesn't really hurt Final Fantasy.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.280
But can we just I'm really only OK with it

42:54.280 --> 42:56.920
as long as we can all admit that it's a waste of time.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.640
I want us all to admit that this is a waste of time and resources

43:00.640 --> 43:02.720
and then I'll be OK with it.

43:02.720 --> 43:04.520
Yeah, pretty much.

43:05.080 --> 43:09.880
Anyway, less of a waste of time are some of the updates that are coming to Twitch.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.880
Actually, some of this stuff sounds pretty cool that they have coming.

43:13.320 --> 43:18.120
So part of this kind of ties into some things that came up

43:18.120 --> 43:22.160
on the week we were out because of TwitchCon in Amsterdam happened.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.240
So there was that.

43:24.240 --> 43:29.920
So what happened is that Twitch was looking at testing some charity.

43:30.320 --> 43:32.480
I'm sorry, I think this came out after.

43:32.480 --> 43:36.800
I'm not sure what was TwitchCon and what wasn't, but Twitch is going to be

43:37.200 --> 43:42.560
integrating some charity fundraising into their platform.

43:42.920 --> 43:47.800
Right now, this is only in a US beta, so it's available for certain streamers.

43:48.040 --> 43:51.760
But this will allow you to select a charity, set a fundraising goal

43:51.760 --> 43:54.920
and then collect donations within the creator dashboard.

43:55.520 --> 43:56.480
So that's kind of neat.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.000
So, yeah.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.200
And actually, it was funny because Jason and I were talking about this

44:00.200 --> 44:03.040
before the show a little bit tonight because he was talking about this in the intro.

44:03.200 --> 44:06.520
And I was like, maybe this is a thing we can do on our next

44:06.520 --> 44:11.520
like anniversary show or big milestone show is since we've run out of ideas

44:11.560 --> 44:13.960
on how to make those shows special, we'll fundraise.

44:14.680 --> 44:17.040
It'll be nice. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Why not?

44:17.240 --> 44:20.880
So hopefully if it makes it really easy to do, I think that's going to be great.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.240
Now, I know this was announced at TwitchCon because of the reception

44:24.240 --> 44:29.440
that it got is that partners and affiliates are getting the payment threshold lowered.

44:29.760 --> 44:33.000
So now you no longer have to make one hundred dollars in a month

44:33.000 --> 44:34.200
in order to get a check.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.040
You only have to make fifty.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.400
So half as much will actually get you a check.

44:38.400 --> 44:40.240
And of course, if you don't raise the money in one month,

44:40.240 --> 44:41.840
then it rolls over to the next month.

44:41.840 --> 44:47.200
But that's that's cool, you know, because there's actually

44:47.200 --> 44:50.360
there was a month like here at VOG.

44:50.680 --> 44:53.080
I think we had ninety six dollars.

44:53.280 --> 44:56.600
And so it was like no check for you, although the check the next month

44:56.600 --> 45:01.480
was pretty big. But yeah, for for VOG, we had a month where it was ninety six dollars.

45:01.480 --> 45:05.280
So now, thanks to y'all's generosity, we'll probably get a little

45:05.280 --> 45:09.200
fundage in the VOG bank account, which is which will be nice.

45:09.600 --> 45:12.240
It'll allow us to do more conventions and things like that in the future,

45:12.240 --> 45:14.960
which, by the way, I hope you all had fun at Southern Fried Game Expo,

45:15.480 --> 45:18.880
which Bobby went to and we didn't get to talk about that last week

45:18.880 --> 45:22.440
because, you know, covid, but that all happened.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.720
And I'm hoping there'll be more conventions.

45:24.720 --> 45:26.880
Dragon Con is six weeks away.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.880
I can't talk about everything I'm doing at Dragon Con yet

45:31.360 --> 45:33.800
because we're not allowed to promote that stuff until August

45:33.800 --> 45:35.960
when the schedule is final final.

45:35.960 --> 45:38.760
But I've seen my preliminary

45:38.760 --> 45:42.600
schedule and it looks really good.

45:42.640 --> 45:43.760
That's all I can say. It looks.

45:43.760 --> 45:45.720
And I will say this.

45:45.720 --> 45:48.160
It does look like I'm going to have a ballroom panel this year.

45:48.640 --> 45:51.960
Fingers and toes crossed so that that those are the big ones.

45:51.960 --> 45:53.640
So fingers and toes crossed.

45:53.640 --> 45:57.440
So but Loki, I'm going to need your help.

45:58.080 --> 46:00.920
And that's all I'm going to say for now. All right.

46:02.480 --> 46:05.480
Bobby wants to point out that there is a YouTube video up

46:06.280 --> 46:08.320
on the VOG YouTube channel.

46:08.320 --> 46:13.520
So, yeah, of the speed running panel that he did there with

46:14.160 --> 46:17.800
an eternal enigma was doing Silent Hill, the room for.

46:18.640 --> 46:23.400
And and then Bobby at the end does his own little he he did this on his show,

46:23.400 --> 46:27.280
but he does the Zelda link to the past four minute speed run trick

46:27.600 --> 46:30.400
because he's trying to prove a point that like if you want to start speed running,

46:30.400 --> 46:33.600
here you go. Here's a trick that you can try at home because it even works on

46:34.600 --> 46:37.400
the Nintendo Switch online and all that. So there's a cute panel.

46:37.440 --> 46:40.000
So check that out. All right.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.120
Let's see. Where was I? Yes.

46:41.120 --> 46:44.040
Twitch updates. One other thing I want to talk about as well.

46:45.720 --> 46:49.200
Apparently, there is some new safety features that are coming as well,

46:49.760 --> 46:53.480
including more customization on who can actually rage you

46:53.720 --> 46:58.080
and being able to share a banned list of banned accounts with other streamers.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.240
So that's nice. Yeah.

47:00.240 --> 47:03.360
So this, of course, all in response to the hate raids,

47:03.360 --> 47:07.120
which were last year, which I admit from my perspective,

47:07.160 --> 47:10.480
I haven't seen nearly as many of those.

47:10.520 --> 47:15.200
I'll see us idiot spam bot once in a while or maybe a village idiot here or

47:15.200 --> 47:19.040
there. But I don't see I'm not just saying because I don't see it personally.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.040
It doesn't happen, but I'm just saying it.

47:21.040 --> 47:24.160
It does seem like I'm not seeing the buzz about it on Twitter.

47:24.160 --> 47:27.600
I'm not seeing the reports about it nearly as much. So it is.

47:27.840 --> 47:31.440
It is nice to see that even though it was kind of slow to get here,

47:31.640 --> 47:36.200
that some of these features have really helped curb a lot of the hate raid

47:36.200 --> 47:39.600
stuff. Um, actually, yeah,

47:39.600 --> 47:44.600
I got raided while playing No Man's Sky and I didn't realize I had turned on the

47:44.600 --> 47:45.880
mandatory verification.

47:46.040 --> 47:50.800
So the people who raided me couldn't chat with me for like five minutes because

47:50.800 --> 47:53.760
they were like, Oh crap, we never verified our accounts.

47:53.880 --> 47:55.840
So I guess they were sitting there trying to verify their accounts.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.560
And then when they finally did, they were like, hi, sorry,

47:57.560 --> 48:00.840
we had to verify our accounts. I was like, Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

48:00.960 --> 48:04.280
I had to turn that on. Like, you know, I'm a gay dude who streams.

48:04.280 --> 48:08.560
So unfortunately, you know, one of many targets. Yeah. So, um,

48:09.400 --> 48:12.160
but yeah, so that is, that is something, um,

48:12.280 --> 48:14.920
I've had that on though since I got hate raided last year.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.320
Oh yeah. Yeah. So, um, let's see,

48:19.960 --> 48:23.000
uh, Mike Defton chat says, thank God for the shared ban list.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.040
I've been wanting that for years now. Yeah. I'm,

48:26.080 --> 48:30.800
I'm very interested to see what sort of underground ban list communities end up

48:30.800 --> 48:35.160
getting formed. Um, because of that, that's going to be very interesting. So,

48:36.360 --> 48:37.120
um, I could,

48:37.120 --> 48:41.920
I could almost with certainty say that if you get banned from VOG network,

48:41.920 --> 48:45.040
you'll probably get banned from my channel and Bobby Black Wolf's channel.

48:45.320 --> 48:49.680
And if she wants in probably dark soccer's channel too. And so it'll be,

48:49.680 --> 48:52.720
I'm all about banning people. So, Hey, so you can,

48:52.760 --> 48:56.440
you can start to see what channels are very likely to start ban list sharing.

48:56.440 --> 49:00.360
So, uh, something, something to think about. Yep. And Rama says me too.

49:00.560 --> 49:04.240
So look out, don't be a shit. Yeah. Just don't be a jerk. No,

49:04.440 --> 49:08.920
nobody listening to this show is making plans on being a jerk. I hope, I hope,

49:09.400 --> 49:13.600
if you got this far into this program, we haven't annoyed you yet.

49:13.640 --> 49:16.040
So clearly, you know, the fact that, you know,

49:17.680 --> 49:20.440
our diverse personalities have not annoyed you yet, uh,

49:20.560 --> 49:24.000
hopefully is a good sign. All right. Yeah. Anyway,

49:24.280 --> 49:28.840
let's move on to something that's very happy, very fun news, uh, dark soccer.

49:29.800 --> 49:34.840
Well, um, uh, we're, we're all, we love toys.

49:35.080 --> 49:39.280
We love our Legos and this is actually super cool. Uh,

49:39.320 --> 49:43.080
probably I'm not going to be able to afford anytime soon, but, um,

49:43.120 --> 49:48.120
Lego has announced the Atari 2,600 set and it looks pretty good.

49:48.120 --> 49:52.880
It's a little wood grain style, you know, that came out when I was, uh,

49:52.920 --> 49:57.320
um, in single age, single number ages. Um,

49:57.920 --> 50:01.640
and it also, it's like, it comes with a cartridge. Um,

50:01.680 --> 50:05.400
it looks like there's actually a few cartridges and the cartridge holder,

50:05.840 --> 50:09.480
we have adventure and centipede and asteroids,

50:10.000 --> 50:13.960
and it also has like a little flip panel where it looks like, you know,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.120
an early 1980s living room.

50:17.320 --> 50:21.360
So I'm down and, uh,

50:22.080 --> 50:22.800
I'm totally down.

50:22.800 --> 50:26.800
There's even like someone playing a key tar on one of the posters. And is,

50:26.840 --> 50:30.600
is that, that better be a cat. It's a cat. Okay.

50:30.600 --> 50:34.000
There is a cat Lego that comes with this. You need it.

50:34.760 --> 50:38.520
Yeah. I, you know, the more and more Lego does, I'm like, dang,

50:38.520 --> 50:41.720
I'm like hundreds of dollars behind and all these sets I want to get.

50:41.720 --> 50:42.400
And I have no,

50:42.400 --> 50:47.040
but I'm really thinking about completely redoing this room and the space you see

50:47.040 --> 50:47.840
behind me.

50:47.840 --> 50:51.000
And I'm thinking about putting shelving where the arcade cabinet is now because

50:51.000 --> 50:55.920
I actually have a walk-in closet, um, that you don't really see on camera,

50:55.920 --> 50:59.680
but there's a walk-in closet just to the side of where all the setup is.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.520
And it actually could fit some of the arcade games in there.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.920
So I'm actually thinking about moving the arcade games into like a little walk

51:06.920 --> 51:11.200
in arcade. Um, and then from there being able to, um,

51:12.760 --> 51:15.960
uh, have some different stuff behind me and maybe some Legos. I don't know.

51:15.960 --> 51:16.800
Now I screwed up my webcam.

51:19.120 --> 51:21.320
I know, I know. And you're, to be fair,

51:21.320 --> 51:25.280
you're not truly the first to suggest that either, but, um, yeah.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.680
I can't hear you.

51:29.720 --> 51:33.760
Sorry. I accidentally tapped the mic button when I was adjusting my camera. Um,

51:34.120 --> 51:37.840
it's, it's probably going to end up happening is pretty much what I was saying.

51:37.880 --> 51:41.880
So, and then that allows me lots of space to get more, well,

51:41.880 --> 51:44.960
at least probably one, two, three against the back wall,

51:44.960 --> 51:49.920
probably about three games will fit in there. So that'd be fun. All right. Um,

51:50.200 --> 51:51.880
but I'm really excited about the Lego set.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.760
I want that and I still want some of the Nintendo ones.

51:55.160 --> 51:57.680
I want the princess peach one. I want the Sonic one.

51:58.760 --> 52:00.360
I'm going to need to dip into my savings account.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.200
That's how it begins. Loki, how about you?

52:06.480 --> 52:10.240
Uh, I don't room for any of this stuff.

52:11.640 --> 52:12.720
What do you have in the news though?

52:13.480 --> 52:16.880
Uh, so Ubisoft, um,

52:16.900 --> 52:21.040
they're having to deal with some delays and

52:21.040 --> 52:22.920
cancellations. Um,

52:22.920 --> 52:27.160
so there was an assassin's creed, um, game set in Japan,

52:27.160 --> 52:30.640
I think that was canceled recently. Um, now of course,

52:30.640 --> 52:35.320
avatar frontiers of Pandora is going to be delayed. Um,

52:35.320 --> 52:39.800
it's not going to come out with the release of the new avatar

52:39.920 --> 52:43.680
movie, but Hey, you waited this long for an avatar sequel.

52:43.680 --> 52:48.080
You can wait even longer for an avatar game. So, you know, it's, it's fine. Uh,

52:48.080 --> 52:50.280
so it's going to be, uh,

52:50.320 --> 52:53.640
launching sometime after March 20, 20 threes,

52:53.640 --> 52:56.760
I'm guessing after the fiscal year. Um,

52:56.800 --> 52:57.880
isn't there like another,

52:57.880 --> 53:00.800
aren't there like three avatar sequels or something they're all coming out like

53:00.800 --> 53:03.800
back to back to back or something? I thought that was what their plan was.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.760
That's the plan is, I don't know what the timeframe are of those other movies,

53:07.760 --> 53:10.720
but it's a little late.

53:12.040 --> 53:15.480
And also the last avatar game wasn't great, but I mean, this looks all right,

53:15.560 --> 53:19.800
I guess. I think the movie will do well. I do. I'm sure it will.

53:19.840 --> 53:22.280
I'm sure it will. Um, what else?

53:22.640 --> 53:27.520
So they're saying that right now the current economic

53:27.520 --> 53:32.080
context carefully and strategically managing our investments is critical.

53:32.080 --> 53:33.040
Now more than ever,

53:33.440 --> 53:37.880
we must therefore succeed in strongly limiting our spending to what is

53:37.880 --> 53:42.240
essential by questioning some of our habits and reflexes.

53:42.560 --> 53:43.960
You mean you're,

53:43.960 --> 53:48.560
you're going to look at addressing some of the sexual sexual harassment

53:48.560 --> 53:52.000
allegations. No, no. Um, by, uh, oh,

53:52.000 --> 53:55.440
reinventing ourselves together to make gains in terms of cost,

53:55.440 --> 53:58.040
agility and efficiency. And that's a bunch of nonsense.

53:58.200 --> 54:00.680
I guess we're not going to see any more laser tag games from them.

54:01.040 --> 54:04.920
Your CEO. Yeah. Good. Maybe. How about,

54:04.960 --> 54:07.240
how about if you want to like show you're really going to be committed to

54:07.240 --> 54:09.440
something radical and take things in a new direction,

54:09.640 --> 54:12.000
why don't you fire your CEO like that? That, that, that,

54:12.000 --> 54:15.120
that would really show like, like less talk, more action.

54:15.960 --> 54:19.360
So some of the games have been canceled so far. Um,

54:19.400 --> 54:23.760
splinter cell VR goes to recon frontline. Um,

54:23.800 --> 54:27.920
the second one was supposed to be a battle rail influenced multiplayer game.

54:28.480 --> 54:32.000
That's what we need more is more battle royale games,

54:32.000 --> 54:35.800
especially after the last one tank too. So I'm, I'm see why that,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.960
and a splinter cell VR game sounds terrible. I'm sorry.

54:39.080 --> 54:42.120
Like it just sounds like you're trying to shove something into VR that doesn't

54:42.120 --> 54:47.080
need to be there. So yeah. Yeah. Um, so right now they have,

54:47.120 --> 54:47.640
you know,

54:47.640 --> 54:51.840
their financial strategy is basing it on a Mario and rabbits,

54:51.880 --> 54:55.000
their new game and the, uh,

54:55.040 --> 54:59.000
skull and bones game, which is still not out yet. You know,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.920
it's the Assassin's creed, the, the pirate part of that,

55:01.960 --> 55:06.720
but not Assassin's creed. So yeah. Um,

55:06.760 --> 55:09.960
we'll see. And then of course they're still working on their live service

55:09.960 --> 55:12.480
project. Assassin's creed infinity.

55:13.360 --> 55:17.560
Is it really infinity though? And also that's a dumb name for it.

55:18.440 --> 55:22.560
Um, I don't know. Yeah.

55:23.480 --> 55:26.800
They're going to have a new Ubisoft forward, uh, September 10th.

55:28.840 --> 55:32.080
Sure. We'll see how that goes. Yeah, I know. Right.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.880
There better be some big surprises in that.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.800
Like how else can they partner with Nintendo to save themselves? Who knows?

55:38.080 --> 55:40.040
We'll see. All right. Um, well,

55:40.040 --> 55:43.600
let's move on and talk about a game that I'm really into it.

55:43.600 --> 55:48.120
This seems to be having a nice long life because of plenty full updates that

55:48.120 --> 55:52.000
this game gets. And that's no man's sky. Uh, got another update this week.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.800
I mentioned it earlier during my gaming week,

55:54.160 --> 55:56.200
but the update is called the endurance update.

55:56.400 --> 56:00.680
It is the 20th major update for the game. Dang. I said 18 on Bobby show earlier.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.680
I didn't realize it was all the way up to 20. Uh,

56:02.680 --> 56:07.120
this comes after the outlaws update came out in April. Um, this time,

56:07.120 --> 56:09.720
what's been changed is mostly fleets and freighters,

56:09.740 --> 56:11.800
but they've also done things with space.

56:12.080 --> 56:16.600
You know how like those really rad science pictures came out this week of space,

56:16.760 --> 56:18.440
that new camera or whatever,

56:18.440 --> 56:21.840
like got the really like much clearer pictures of space.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.360
And you can like see the galaxies out there. And it's like one of those, like,

56:26.160 --> 56:28.400
like you just want to get high and contemplate life.

56:28.440 --> 56:32.400
When you look at a picture like that, because it's like, whoa,

56:32.840 --> 56:36.760
the universe it's so big.

56:36.800 --> 56:38.320
I think of the Animaniacs song.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.760
It's a great big universe and we're all really.

56:44.400 --> 56:47.360
Anyway, well, if you want to sing that song every day, play more, no man's sky.

56:47.600 --> 56:50.160
Um, so, so, but to me like,

56:50.160 --> 56:52.880
and this couldn't have been intended because I'm sure they didn't know those

56:52.880 --> 56:53.760
pictures were coming,

56:53.760 --> 56:57.760
but I feel like they made the universe with the asteroid artifacts and the stars

56:57.760 --> 56:59.800
in the sky, and you can see nebulas and things now,

57:00.000 --> 57:03.520
like they made it more like that photo, uh, making things better.

57:03.520 --> 57:04.800
So I thought that was really cool,

57:05.040 --> 57:08.440
but otherwise your freighters can really become a space space,

57:08.640 --> 57:12.240
more themed rooms. You can have a dedicated room for crops.

57:12.560 --> 57:15.760
You can have a catwalk so you can walk into your fashion strut. No,

57:15.760 --> 57:19.640
it's a catwalk outside, but anyway, uh, observation deck, glass corridor.

57:19.640 --> 57:21.680
So you can like look out at the planets below,

57:21.680 --> 57:25.240
probably get some really cool photos that way. So yeah, it's just, you know,

57:25.280 --> 57:28.880
just sounds like they've really, uh, improved the freighter mini game. Um,

57:28.880 --> 57:30.320
but overall,

57:31.000 --> 57:34.440
this probably isn't quite as big of an update as they usually are,

57:34.680 --> 57:35.880
but you know what,

57:35.960 --> 57:38.880
considering this game is still putting the content out after like six years,

57:38.880 --> 57:40.880
Hey, it's hard to complain. Uh,

57:40.920 --> 57:43.360
there will be a new expedition that comes with this as well. Uh,

57:43.400 --> 57:45.320
Polestar is the name of the new expedition.

57:45.520 --> 57:47.800
You're gonna be taking your capital ship on the galaxy.

57:47.880 --> 57:50.760
So they are going to go to freighters and it sounds like you're going to have to

57:50.760 --> 57:54.160
move your freighter around the galaxy as opposed to your normal spaceships.

57:54.160 --> 57:57.920
That could be interesting. Um, so, but that has not started yet.

57:58.040 --> 58:01.720
It's very rare for the expedition to not start with the patch, but again,

58:01.720 --> 58:05.360
I think they're just ironing out bugs. Um, I hope they are. Cause it was,

58:05.800 --> 58:09.480
it was kind of a yikes on the last expedition, uh, as a reminder,

58:09.520 --> 58:12.520
no man's sky will hit the Nintendo switch on October 7th.

58:12.520 --> 58:15.080
And it's going to have all these patches with it already,

58:15.080 --> 58:16.760
which makes sense of course. Uh,

58:16.800 --> 58:20.520
and a PlayStation VR two version will be coming out soon as well.

58:20.800 --> 58:25.200
And I didn't know this. I thought this already existed, but, um,

58:25.320 --> 58:29.160
um, a dedicated Mac OS version of no man's sky is coming. I thought,

58:29.160 --> 58:31.720
I thought for sure that already existed, but, um,

58:31.760 --> 58:35.800
they announced that at WWDC apparently, and I just fell off my radar.

58:36.400 --> 58:40.400
So, uh, you're muted, shark sucker. I see your mouse, uh, saying something.

58:40.480 --> 58:41.680
I just said it's about final,

58:41.720 --> 58:45.280
finally and Capcom is also starting to show more support. So yeah,

58:45.600 --> 58:49.320
I just assumed it was already on Mac cause it's everywhere else. But, uh,

58:49.360 --> 58:50.200
there you go.

58:50.600 --> 58:53.360
I haven't been able to play it since I moved to my, uh, to my Mac.

58:53.840 --> 58:57.800
Well, maybe, maybe, Hey, I got you into dead by daylight.

58:57.800 --> 59:00.400
Maybe I'll get you into no man's sky at some point. I don't know.

59:00.400 --> 59:01.240
It might be a little too.

59:01.240 --> 59:05.840
You know, if Haver and the people who is it that does VHS would

59:05.840 --> 59:09.760
ever get rid of the anti-cheat thing and actually use something good.

59:09.760 --> 59:13.760
I'd be able to play on my steam account, but no, anyway.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.720
All right. Uh, let's see, uh, dark, uh,

59:17.760 --> 59:21.240
dark to see and chat says Polestar makes me think of the Neo Geo shoot him up.

59:21.920 --> 59:26.560
It's it's pole like a flag pole Polestar, but yeah, it's this funny.

59:26.800 --> 59:31.800
So, um, dark to see it says I'm going to restart my NMS save on piece PS four,

59:32.280 --> 59:34.520
but I think I'll just wait for the switch version to come out so I can just

59:34.520 --> 59:36.080
start fresh and on my own system. Yeah.

59:36.280 --> 59:39.040
Unfortunately there is no cross progression.

59:39.240 --> 59:44.160
The only cross progression that exists is between windows store

59:44.560 --> 59:47.720
and X-Box series, uh, X-Box one.

59:48.240 --> 59:50.280
So that, because, and that makes sense, right?

59:50.280 --> 59:52.880
The Microsoft family is all essentially the same thing,

59:52.920 --> 59:56.680
whether you're playing it on a PC, uh, or, or an X, a dedicated X-Box,

59:56.960 --> 59:57.920
that's the only one.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:02.440
And that's why I actually moved from X-Box series X where I was playing it to

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.000
now I'm playing it on my new PC, uh, thanks to windows store. So, um,

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.200
let's see. And, um, yeah,

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.680
me says a freighter is the thing you can keep your ships on, right? Yes.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.320
You always get one after your fifth jump in the game.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.440
And thank you, Jason.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.280
And chat reminded me that telescope that takes the pictures,

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.120
the James Webb telescope was the name of the, uh,

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.640
very awesome pictures that came out and just like, seriously,

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.840
like even if you're only like casually into space stuff, it's just like, I,

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.080
I never really considered myself a space nerd,

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:39.040
but I do find I tend to really enjoy sci-fi space games always.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.040
When I went to the museum of flight in Seattle, I loved the space stuff.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.880
They have a lot of space stuff there and I loved seeing it. So I think,

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.600
I think I'm, I think I'm a closet space nerd. Well,

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.480
I'm not in the closet about anything these days, but you know,

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.960
a little bit more of a space nerd than I would have thought. So, uh, yeah,

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.120
that's maybe why I like no man's sky and talk about it so much. Who knows? Well,

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.240
one system that never got no man's sky was the Wii U and I'm sure it's never

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.440
going to get it. Uh, dark Sakura what's happening in Nintendo's world.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440
Do we need to queue in Vogue?

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:14.440
Never going to get it, never going to get it.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.440
Um, anyway, um,

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.440
so Nintendo is, uh,

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:20.440
shutting down the Wii U in 3DS eShop. Um,

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:25.440
start it, wait, this says March. Oh,

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.440
nevermind. I'm looking at the wrong date. Um, this is on March 27th, 2023.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.440
So, I mean, you got like the better part of a year,

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.440
but you got like the better part of a year.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.440
You know, um, but as of that day, um,

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.440
and actually as of August 29th, 2022,

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.440
you won't be able to add funds to either eShop.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.440
So if you're going to buy them, buy them now, um,

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.440
cause there is no other way to get some of these games. So,

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.440
and this, I think it was bound to happen.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.440
As Jason called out earlier in the show,

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.440
theater them curtain call is an excellent example of that.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.440
Um, when they, they could do,

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.440
and some of you are probably wondering like, well,

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.440
how would they do it with the touch pad and everything,

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.440
even though the switch screen,

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.440
but they could adapt the arcade version, uh, and have that. But, um, yeah.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.440
Uh, and then I was going to say, um,

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:19.440
the virtual console still has some things. What's that?

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.440
I actually still have my theater of them cartridge. Yeah. And you,

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.440
and if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you,

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.440
if you want to, if you want to, if you want to,

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.440
if you want to, if you want to, if you want to,

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.440
Yeah. And you, and if you bought things on cartridge, that's cool,

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.440
but it might be hard to find those cartridges now.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.440
Then plus the DLC is going to be the big thing in those games. Um,

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.440
cause there was a lot of DLC for theater of them. So, um, yeah.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.440
And there's, there's a lot of stuff that was really unique to the 3DS.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.440
The Wii U probably has a handful of games that never came over to the

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.440
switch that you still might want to check out.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.440
Like a wonderful one-on-one comes to mind and there's, you know, a few,

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.440
but Nintendo's honestly ported most of their library over to the switch

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:05.440
at this point. Um, but there's, there's a, there's a few things,

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.440
especially I would say like in the,

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.440
specifically the store that Nintendo shop indie titles and virtual

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.440
console and that stuff that are,

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.440
that are worth picking up because like the Konami titles and that they're,

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.440
they're not showing up in switch online's library for whatever reason. So,

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.440
um, I would be very, uh,

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.440
very much probably going to go through the store and try to pick up a few

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.440
things just to make sure I have them on file for sure.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.440
Especially on the 3DS. I don't really have my Wii U hooked up as much anymore,

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.440
but I still have a working 3DS.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.440
Like why wouldn't I make sure I've got everything I want on there?

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.440
So, all right. Uh, on a different note,

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440
let's go to this next story from Loki.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.440
Yeah. So there's a brand new indie horror game that's kind of got a weird

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.440
gimmick to it. It's called the refund me if you can.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:55.440
And of course is it's alluding to the refund policy.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.440
On steam where if you played a game for more than two hours,

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.440
you cannot refund it.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:04.440
So the game is challenging you to beat the game in two hours.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.440
Also after two hours, the achievements are locked forever.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.440
You can't get any more achievements in the game.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:16.440
And so basically it challenges you with going through a maze with a hundred

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.440
different paths, but only one of those is the correct one.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.440
Oop.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440
I didn't mean to.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440
All right.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.440
I didn't mean to play the switch sound effect right issue.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.440
Sorry.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:30.440
I was bringing up a trailer for the next story and the little impeccably

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.440
timed. Uh, sorry about that, but, um,

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.440
it's the problem of running everything from one computer here. Um, yeah,

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.440
it's a, it's a clever little play on that mechanic,

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.440
but it's on the whole, like it's a social commentary on the steam refund

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.440
thing, which I know pisses a lot of developers off,

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.440
but it sounds like the game is not particularly great. Right.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.440
Like it's.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.440
It's all right.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.440
It looks like a little bit.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.440
It looks, it's all of its shovelware, but it's not like,

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.440
it's not super, super polished. I mean, it,

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.440
it looks like they're charging $4 for it.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:06.440
It looks like a game that you'd pay about four bucks for, um,

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.440
which is fine if that's what they're trying to do.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.440
It's only in like a two hour experience. So.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.440
I don't know.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.440
Fine. I guess. Yeah.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.440
So if, you know, you want to try to beat it in two hours,

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.440
it's fine.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.440
It's fine.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.440
Yeah.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.440
So if you want to try to beat it in two hours, you can.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.440
I'm sure a lot of people are going to go through the hassle for $4.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.440
So.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.440
Dr. C says, so he wasn't expecting to make much on it anyway.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.440
It seems probably not.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:32.440
I'm sure all this free press is going a long way though. And here,

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.440
here we are talking about it too, but I do think it's a,

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.440
I look at it more social commentary than a game. It's,

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.440
it's really like commentary on that system and how it really irks a lot

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440
of developers.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.440
Cause there are people that abuse it for sure. So.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.440
Yeah.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.440
Well, let's talk about some classics,

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.440
not the classic game of the week just yet, very soon though.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.440
But let's talk about some classics making their way to the Nintendo

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.440
switch online library. Now,

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.440
you know why I was playing that sound earlier,

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.440
but they actually came out just this week. We got an update to the

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.440
classic Nintendo switch online app.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:12.440
We've got fighters history just came out on the Nintendo switch online

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.440
library. This was the one,

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:18.440
wasn't this the one that ended up causing the lawsuit with Capcom and

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.440
all that, because it's like really similar to street fighter.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.440
Like it's yeah.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:26.440
Also Kirby's avalanche. So, you know, if,

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.440
I love this game wasn't enough,

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.440
then here it is. Kirby's avalanche is coming out instead.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.440
So that is out as well. And then there's a NES title.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.440
And this is kind of interesting because this is one that was actually

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.440
imported. This is,

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.440
DIVA is the short name of it.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:46.440
The long name of the game is, and of course I closed my screen here.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.440
So it's imperial of the, yes,

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:52.440
I could just read the screen. Couldn't I? Yes.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.440
Is out on the NES.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.440
And I believe this is something that was only out in Japan before,

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.440
but now it's going to be coming out here and they've done that with a

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.440
few titles and that's cool.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.440
That's the stuff that I really like to see happen.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:08.440
In the Nintendo switch online. So that's pretty cool.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.440
I believe Japan has a similar lineup,

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.440
but it does get a little different.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:17.440
They have a different game coming out.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.440
And of course, now that I'm trying to find it,

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:23.440
I don't have my story up and chat room will probably beat me to it.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.440
But where was it?

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.440
Oh, Japan gets Kirby star status.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:37.440
Oh, Japan gets Kirby star stacker on the super Famicom instead.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.440
So it's a different Kirby game instead of Kirby's avalanche,

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440
because I don't,

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.440
I don't think Kirby's avalanche was actually released in Japan, right?

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:49.440
That was a way to get Puyo Puyo out here in the States was to slap

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:54.440
Kirby and Sonic on it for the Genesis. So anyway,

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.440
a dark to see and chat says dive.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.440
What's that?

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.440
Have I not covered it?

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.440
I can't remember that far back. I'd have to search the Wiki.

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.440
Yep. It never, it never came out in Japan.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.440
It came out in Europe as Kirby's ghost trap.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.440
Ah, okay.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.440
And it was developed by Hal Compile and Ben Presto.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.440
Let's see.

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.440
Yeah.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.440
SD100 Matt says like if I had a hundred chess chances,

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:23.440
I couldn't guess that these titles would be on this update,

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.440
such a random pick of games.

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.440
And Mike Deff says, yeah, avalanche wasn't released in Japan.

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.440
Um, yeah. And, um, why, why would they need to, uh,

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.440
because it was only in, um, they have Puyo Puyo in Japan.

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.440
Uh, Mike Deff says-

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.440
We also had Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.440
Right.

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.440
Uh, Mike Deff says we didn't get Star Stacker here.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:45.440
We only got the Game Boy version. Well, again, it is,

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.440
and I've said this before, but I'll say it again.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:51.440
It is very easy to just create a Japanese Nintendo online account.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.440
Just create a separate account and localize it to Japan.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.440
You don't have to buy or sub or anything. You just,

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.440
you download the clients and then play them on your US account and you

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.440
can play all this stuff in Japan. Now,

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.440
everything's written in Japanese in the emulator,

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:08.440
but if you play enough of the other one, you know, or, you know,

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.440
it's pretty easy to figure that stuff out now at this point. So, uh,

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.440
check that out. All right. Uh,

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:18.440
now I think we will talk about officially a little bit more of a classic

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.440
time. So let's go to the next segment.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:31.440
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:36.440
or I'll dive into the and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.440
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:44.440
I keep having audio leak through when I don't intend to.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.440
I'll blame the COVID. All right. What's the classic classic game of the week

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440
tonight, Darsagra?

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:52.440
Mushi Himesama.

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.440
Mushi Himesama, which means bug princess.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.440
It is one of those cave shooters because it's by cave.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:07.440
And it was originally distributed by AMI in 2004

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.440
and then redistributed to arcades in 2011.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.440
So, um, that version though, was the, uh,

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.440
version, uh, 1.5.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.440
That was a bit different and that one was ported to PlayStation 2,

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.440
but I'll get into the ports and all this stuff. So anyway, um,

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:30.440
the game has a, uh, um,

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.440
a bug theme. As you can tell, um, the enemies resemble beat, uh,

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.440
beetles and butterflies and you go through forest environments.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.440
Um, and it is as wild

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.440
as, as one might expect it to be. It, it is very,

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.440
very cave. Anyway,

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.440
in the world of Mushi Himesama, there is an untainted,

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.440
uh,

01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.440
one where there are these areas change into lush forests

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:05.440
and all by arthropods called koju and they're basically big bugs.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.440
Um, but when they die,

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.440
vegetation grows up around them. So they do the life cycle,

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.440
but, um, their,

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.440
their life sense is poisonous to humans.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:22.440
So they have to sacrifice like a 15 year old girl,

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:27.440
but this time the one who had to do it was the princess or something.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.440
So she's just like, uh, no, um,

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.440
every like stuff goes wrong and she has to, to, you know,

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.440
kill the bugs. So at any rate, um,

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.440
the game was, I mean, really, really great. There was, uh,

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.440
the PS2 port by Taito, um,

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.440
that came out in 2005 in Japan does limited version that had, uh,

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:59.440
little, uh, figures of, uh, Reko and, uh, Kinero, um,

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.440
exclusive on that one, as well as an arranged mode, um,

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.440
a variation of the maniac mode where you start off with much more firepower,

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.440
but no continues.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.440
And if you make a bullet with an enemy while holding a bomb, you don't die,

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.440
but you release the bomb instead. Um, and then you can, of course,

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.440
move through all of your weapons. Um, now,

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.440
another thing about this one,

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.440
and this is what people may be more familiar with in the U S is the iOS

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.440
version, which I played a bunch of, um,

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.440
but it was, uh, uh, Mushihime Sama, uh, Hutari.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.440
Um, actually I take that back. We're going back.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.440
Mushihime Sama bug panic was the one that came out on, um, on iOS.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.440
And, uh, it was, I mean,

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.440
you could put it up to hell mode, which played like the arcade release.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.440
I played on easy mode. Um, and then there,

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.440
and then there was the sequel, um, in 2006,

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.440
which was Mushihime Sama Hutari. Um,

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:07.440
Hutari is, means two. So it's bug princess duo.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.440
So it was a two player bullet hell. Um, and then, uh,

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.440
other versions that came out is that Cave did an HD version for

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.440
Xbox 360 on May 24, 2012 in Japan that had novice arranged in

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:25.440
Xbox 360 mode, um, where the arrange is the modified PS2 arranged mode.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.440
Um, no arcade mode.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.440
The Xbox 360 mode is as like the arcade release,

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.440
but with better visuals. And, and then the, uh,

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:39.440
the first copies had version 1.5 is DLC. Um,

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:43.440
and there were limited editions and an arranged soundtrack and all of

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.440
that. And then, uh,

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.440
Digica released a port for windows through

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:51.440
steam on November 5th, 2015.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.440
And it was developed, uh, pretty much by cave,

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:57.440
but it's based on the Xbox 360, uh,

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.440
HD port with all of the similar modes,

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.440
but without that, um,

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.440
the version 1.5 mode that could be, um, uh,

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.440
could be arranged in there were like limited release qualities.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.440
And so steam had paid DLC available for all of that.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:19.440
Um, of course the steam one was international while the Xbox 360 port

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.440
was, uh, NTSC J region locked.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.440
So, I mean,

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.440
Famitsu gave this some pretty, uh,

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.440
favorable ratings for the PS2.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.440
It got a 26 out of 40,

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.440
but the Xbox 360 version got a 31 out of 40. So they really, really,

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.440
you know, bumped it up quite a bit. Um,

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.440
it was, uh, for Metacritic,

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.440
it has an aggregate score of 86 of a hundred. Um,

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.440
Destructoid gave the PC version a nine out of 10 saying that it is a

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.440
must play title. And I think it's just one of those, you know,

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.440
really cute,

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:04.440
yet very difficult games. And I mean,

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.440
not everyone knew about Mushihime Sama.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.440
I'm just going to throw that out there. It is a little bit one,

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.440
I think of the lesser known ones outside of bullet hell fans,

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.440
you know, here, uh, outside of Japan.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.440
I'm definitely one of those people. Like I did not, I,

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:22.440
I feel like you've probably showed me this game like very quickly before,

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.440
but I just, I don't remember this one at all, but it looks very cool.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.440
Like it's, it doesn't even work on iOS anymore. Ah,

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.440
yeah. It's been completely retired,

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.440
I think because it required different architecture to play.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.440
But yeah, I mean,

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.440
I always thought that there should be like a Mushihime Sama RPG or

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.440
something. Cause it lights up a little universe that was in,

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.440
but that's it. There it is.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.440
There it is your classic game of the week, bug princess,

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.440
Mushihime Sama. It's a classic game of the week. Uh, I,

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.440
are we going to have a theme of cave shooters?

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.440
Cause I think you did one very, you did one last week too, right?

01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.440
Or two weeks ago, I guess.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.440
No, I did Ikaruga.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.440
Yeah. So not long ago.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.440
So anyway, um,

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440
Which was treasure.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.440
Good. Oh yeah. Yeah.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.440
Good pick for your classic game of the week. Uh, thank you. Thank you.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.440
Um, all right.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.440
Let's travel around and do quickly some rapid fire news and see what else

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.440
is going on in the gaming industry. Loki.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.440
We have some more characters announced for multi-versus.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.440
So we have LeBron James, uh,

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.440
as featured in space jam,

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:29.440
a new legacy is going to be a character in the game as well.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.440
And then of course,

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.440
Rick and Morty are going to be appearing as well.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:36.440
And those are actually as of the 26.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.440
So in a couple more days, they'll be available to play.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.440
Um, neat, I guess.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.440
Still not a fan of the game of the week.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440
Yeah.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.440
And then, uh,

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.440
no more heroes is going to be coming to our normal heroes.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:53.440
Three is going to be coming to PC, PlayStation and Xbox in October.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.440
Uh, it looks like on the 11th of October.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.440
So that's pretty awesome.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.440
I'll have to check that out.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.440
Uh, dark Sakura.

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.440
It's so well.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.440
A controversial thing actually,

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.440
believe it or not is that, uh,

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.440
we're going to be talking about, uh,

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.440
the, uh,

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440
uh,

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.440
uh,

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.440
well,

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.440
a controversial thing actually,

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.440
believe it or not is that, um,

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:19.440
the dead by daylight attack on Titan collection is now available in

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.440
version 6.1 0.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.440
Um, it looks,

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.440
everybody looks really good except for Dwight and Jake.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.440
Just saying they're saggy,

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.440
but pants make them look like they have no waist.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.440
Oh, I hate, I hate the Felix.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.440
I cannot stand the Felix.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:37.440
I like the Felix one.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.440
The Felix one is very,

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.440
I mean, his hair isn't good because that hair just doesn't suit him,

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:46.440
but the outfit is, I mean, very, you know,

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.440
The killer, the killer skins are fantastic though.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.440
I don't really care for the spirit that much,

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.440
but I do like how Oni looked and I now have a special space in my heart

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.440
for that Oni cosmetic because I stayed completely hidden from an Oni an

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.440
entire match who was wearing that cosmetic.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:08.440
He saw me once and then I got out with hatch and no hooks and no hits.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440
Uh, Dr. Seuss says I saw that,

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.440
but didn't know what the reception was from the DVD community.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.440
So can I get into a little something?

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.440
Yeah, sure.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:18.440
I have a feeling you're going to go.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.440
So yeah.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.440
Yeah.

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:24.440
So there's a lot of controversy around the ending of attack on Titan and

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:28.440
even a lot of the various themes that come out in it that, um,

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:33.440
some people argue that it is flat out antisemitism.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.440
Um, and certainly if you know your history very well and have paid attention

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.440
to some of the, uh, I can make words happen,

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.440
publications of the, uh, uh, mangaka.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:50.440
Um, he's got some very interesting heroes in even going so far as to

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:55.440
pattern a character in the anime after a very controversial, uh,

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.440
commander, uh,

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:01.440
who is responsible for quite a few atrocities against, uh, uh,

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.440
the Korean people and Chinese people. And actually as a result,

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.440
attack on Titan has been banned in China.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.440
Um,

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.440
but I don't want to go too much into it because I certainly do see the

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.440
parallels, even though I'm not convinced it's intentional,

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.440
maybe.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.440
Um,

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.440
but at the same time,

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.440
there are quite a few people, um,

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.440
in the community who have, uh,

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.440
stated that they are leaving the game over it.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.440
Oh, wow.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.440
Um, and I understand why.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.440
And, but we'll,

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:45.440
if anyone wants to know more about it, uh,

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.440
I've got links for you and I'm not going to go into the rest of my,

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.440
I've gone into my personal opinions on my, on my stream, um,

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.440
right when everything came out, I addressed my feelings on it. Um,

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.440
so, but it's all completely up to,

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.440
up to you guys. And by the way, uh, Ron Chan,

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.440
the presence of a Manji is a little bit different.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:13.440
I mean, basically it's mostly Western cultures that have a problem with

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.440
the use of Manji,

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.440
which is actually going exactly the opposite way of a swastika.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.440
This is different. This is going into full on,

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:28.440
like for some people saying that it is a,

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.440
a complete parallel, a, no, this is what I mean. This is, you know,

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.440
this conspiracy theory and I'm mirroring it in my show,

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:40.440
but I don't think that's entirely it.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:44.440
I mean, your mileage may vary. Don't at me because honestly,

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:48.440
I've done my research. I know what I'm talking about.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:52.440
I didn't really care for it after the second season anyway, but

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.440
take it as you will.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.440
I don't know the show at all. I've never bothered, you know,

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.440
I'll admit the first two seasons were freaking great. I mean, I,

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:06.440
I loved it. It was, and then it just like, it took that turn then like,

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:09.440
okay. Okay.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.440
I don't really care for the direction that this is going in and kind of lost

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.440
interest.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:18.440
The first few seasons were action and had great character development.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.440
I mean,

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.440
it got weird.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.440
But to go back to the original question about how has it been received by

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.440
the community? I mean, these things are,

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.440
and these types of skins always seem to print money for behavior

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.440
entertainment. And again, I, this.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:34.440
First major pairing with an anime studio. Yeah.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.440
I have, I have no data to back this up besides,

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.440
I see one of these skins in every match I've been playing recently.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.440
Yeah.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.440
This week. I see one,

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.440
a lot of these skins in every match I've been playing recently.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.440
Yeah.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.440
Uh, this week I see one like a Zorina almost.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:53.440
I love that skin is the best at all the survivors. I'm for sure. So, um,

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.440
yeah, or, or the killer ones. I see,

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.440
I've seen that spirit a couple of times now, so it's just, uh, yeah.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.440
But, um, I mean, and I actually really like, uh,

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.440
Kate's Historia outfit. Cause.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.440
First of all, she's closed.

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.440
I can't, I can't stand the ACE one,

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.440
but apparently it's very loyal to the characters.

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:11.440
I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.440
I can't, I can't stand the ACE one,

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.440
but apparently it's very loyal to the character.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.440
The ACE one I think is really good because it makes ACE actually look

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:23.440
decent. Um, but, um, I,

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.440
I have to actually, there's a point that I agree with that, uh,

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:30.440
Losing Color pointed out about the hair for some of these is that the

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:35.440
hairs look like they're a bad wig that don't fit,

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.440
but some of them actually look really good. Like of course,

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.440
Zarina and, um, Kate as Historia. So, um,

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.440
but everybody else,

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:49.440
they try to do the anime hair thing in Dead by Daylight and it doesn't

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.440
work. The style just doesn't match up that way.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:58.440
So, at any rate, that's my aesthetic, uh, judgment.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:03.440
Also, uh, Dwight and, uh, um, uh, Jake look dumpy. The end.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.440
All right. Uh, one more story. This one's coming out of Comic-Con,

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.440
which is going on San Diego Comic-Con happened this weekend.

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:12.440
And so we've been getting some headlines out of that, including, uh,

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:15.440
that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Kawabunga collection,

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:18.440
which is basically Konami's latest collection of stuff, uh,

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.440
is going to be happening. Uh, and, uh, we,

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.440
we knew the game was coming, but now we know the date.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:27.440
August 30th is the release date of the game. PS5, PS4,

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:30.440
Xbox one, Xbox series, PC, Nintendo switch.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:33.440
So pretty much anything with a power switch that plays modern games will

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:38.440
be able to run this as well. Uh, 13 games across the eight and 16 bit eras,

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:42.440
or the time when Konami actually had the license, uh,

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.440
including the arcade version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, uh,

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.440
the original, uh, as well as Turtles in Time.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.440
And then the first four console games, uh, Genesis game,

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:56.440
Game Boy games, tournament fighters, NES, SNES, Genesis.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.440
There's so much Ninja Turtles in here.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:05.440
Tiger claw is going to be very happy for at least two weeks. So enjoy that.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.440
But no, I'm, I'm going to be happy too. I, I even, okay. Okay.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:14.440
Who's ready for a hot take? I even actually really enjoy the original eight

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.440
bit game. Yes. It's hard as hell. Yes. It's, it,

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:21.440
it's kind of derpy compared to the arcade. I, I,

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:25.440
I just have memories from being a kid playing it that I actually kind of enjoy

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.440
it for five minutes before I switched to something else.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.440
But that's what these collections are for, right?

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:36.440
Now you can get an achievement and prove to your friends that you beat that

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.440
stupid underwater level and you can officially have that achievement in your

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.440
inventory. Actually, I don't know if it has the achievement in the inventory,

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:45.440
but, uh, that's my assumption. So, uh,

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.440
and tiger claw does point out you could use safe states. So that's true.

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.440
That's true. All right.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.440
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.440
little sooner than the cowabunga collection. Uh, Loki,

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:01.440
we'll start with the U S yeah. We have a surprising number of games actually

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.440
coming out this week. So, uh, starting things off, we have hell point,

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:10.440
which is coming out on the Xbox series X and

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.440
that's going to be, uh, let's see by tiny build. That's pretty cool.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.440
Uh, Noel, the mortal fate that's on Xbox

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.440
one. Uh, we've got story of seasons,

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.440
uh, pioneers of all of town on PlayStation four

on the Nintendo switch. Oh, okay. I know. I'm like, he's reading all my releases. Really?

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.440
I'm not even joking. It's visual novel week. No. Well, and it's, it's also that the

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:09.440
switch is it. Things are becoming a little more global in the release stuff,

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.440
especially on the switch front. That's just a general trend that's been happening thanks to the shift to digital.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:19.440
So anyway, a mysterious saga to the sacred sword of

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:24.440
Sylvan, Sylvan Esther on a PC.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:29.440

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:39.440

one story of seasons pioneers of all of town also coming out in PlayStation four later in the

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:59.440
week. And last but not least, Xena Blade Chronicles three on Nintendo switch.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:04.440
I saw a game that said hell pie. All right.

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.440
Going over to Japan. I wasn't kidding. Loki really did mention pretty much a lot of the same stuff that's coming out in Japan.

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:14.440
Let me hit on some of the highlights. Did you survive also on the switch this week? That's

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:19.440
probably going to be a pretty big one. Dungeon munchies is coming out as well in Japan this week on the

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:24.440
28th as your striker gun volt three in a regular and a limited edition is out that

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:29.440
Komaju Remilia Scarlet Symphony is out in a regular and limited edition, but it is

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:34.440
being released in English in Japan. Grim grimoire once more also out on the switch

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:39.440
this week and final vendetta also out this week. And there is

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:44.440
actually a new controller coming out that is a Pokemon Charizard Vortex themed

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:49.440
controller that's coming out this week. That might be third party actually. I'm not sure why that's snuck on my list, but there it is.

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:54.440
And then of course Xena Blade Chronicles three I'm pretty sure is a worldwide release. So that is

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:59.440
also out in a regular and collector's edition this week in

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:04.440
Japan. Quickly looking at the PS5 to see what we have different there. The Legend of Heroes

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:09.440
Kuro Nukisuke is out in Japan this week as well as

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:14.440
that's it. Final Vendetta is also out on the PS5 this week in

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:19.440
Japan. Let's go to Europe Dark Sakura. In Europe we have

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.440
on the 28th for PC or for actually any computer Sims 4

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:29.440
High School Years expansion pack. On Switch on the 29th

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:34.440
the rest of these are all the 29th. We have Xena Blade Chronicles 3 PlayStation. We have Story of Seasons

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:39.440
Pioneers of Olive Town, Lawn Mowing Simulator Landmark Edition,

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:44.440
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge and also Digimon

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:49.440
Survive. I guess I can actually say

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:54.440
Ninja instead of Hero. I think they did rebrand it officially in Europe

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:59.440
finally. At some point they finally turned it around.

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:04.440
All right. We have some more into stories and then we're going to get to your

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.440
calls, emails and other comments in our Listener Roundtable. But first

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:14.440
Loki. Yeah, so there is a brand, well there's

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:19.440
always new content coming to Grand Theft Auto Online but this is supposed to be one of the biggest

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:24.440
updates that they've done for Grand Theft Auto Online. It's coming out on July 26th called Criminal Enterprises

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:29.440
and they're supposed to be, I guess it's supposed to be topical

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:34.440
but that is part of the update. They're adding a series of

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:39.440
new missions that you team up with the IAA which is I guess like the CIA

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:44.440
and then you take down, apparently you're trying to take

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:49.440
down a notorious oil rich dynasty in Los

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.440
Santos. It's people who are profiteering off of heat and soaring prices.

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:59.440
Oh my gosh, it's like ripped out of the headlines. So

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:04.440
in it they're also going to have some more ways to make cash in the game

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:09.440
with in-game businesses including biker bars which is kind of cool, kind of a throwback

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:14.440
to Lost and Damned.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:19.440
Except I'm not interested in it because it's not a single player expansion.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:24.440
I'll just wait for six. But yeah, all this time they've

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:29.440
been working on it and it ends up being that. Well and then they've added some more

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:34.440
quality of life changes they said so players will now be able to buy max ammo for all weapons at

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:39.440
once via some interactions menu. What else

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.440
site? On PC you'll be able to turn off chat.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:49.440
None of these look really, really interesting.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:54.440
The race creator tool has been greatly expanded. So that's cool.

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:59.440
Allowing to increase the player count and add more checkpoints and props because I

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:04.440
know you had kind of a limited amount of like objects you can use because of memory

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:09.440
stuff. But I'm sure since we're now just continue the PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:14.440
actually even PlayStation 3 and Xbox got this game has been out so long. So like

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:19.440
with the previous versions being discontinued obviously those caps can

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:24.440
go up because the newer consoles can handle more objects and stuff in game.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:29.440
So I like to see that because there's you can do some crazy stuff with those races.

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:34.440
So that's pretty cool at least. Still not going to play it.

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:39.440
All right. Let's go to Dark Sakura with an interesting development in this saga.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:44.440
Unions, unions, we like unions.

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:49.440
So another Activision Blizzard studio is trying to unionize

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:54.440
20 QA workers at Blizzard Albany.

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:59.440
They filed for union election. They were formerly known as Vicarious Visions.

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:04.440
That's a cool name. And so they went public on this past

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:09.440
Tuesday and filed for union election with the National Labor

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:14.440
Relations Board, the NLRB. And the group said it was seeking representation

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:19.440
with the Communications Workers of America. So 20 workers

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:24.440
were involved with that, as I mentioned earlier, and they want

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:29.440
more pay transparency, fair compensation, better benefits. And they want to work with

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:34.440
Activision Blizzard to have a process, a good process for

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:39.440
addressing workplace issues predominantly involving

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:44.440
employee misconduct. So

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:49.440
here's a quote from the group. QA is currently an undervalued

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:54.440
discipline in the games and software industries. We strive to foster work environments where we are

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:59.440
respected and compensated for our essential role in the development process.

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:04.440
So Activision did acknowledge the request,

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:09.440
but they haven't said anything other than this quote from one of their

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.440
spokespeople. Our top priority remains our employees. We deeply respect the rights

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:19.440
of all employees under the law to make their own decisions about whether or not to join a union. We believe the direct relationship

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:24.440
between the company and its employees is the most productive relationship. The company will be publicly

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:29.440
and formally providing a response to the petition to the NLRB.

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.440
The snowball is continuing to build.

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:39.440
People. Yeah. I'm very curious to see how this

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:44.440
can because of a curious visions. That was a pretty big day. They were the big part of the Diablo 2

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:49.440
remake that came out last year. So that's that. And that was a pretty big release. So I'm

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:54.440
very curious to see how this all plays out. Yeah. And the

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:59.440
Tony Hawk one and two remakes as as showing her to Matt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So very curious to see

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.440
how this continues. I mean, I think I think they end up unionizing.

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:09.440
I think that part's not a surprise. I think it's the continued snowball effect from here.

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:14.440
So but we knew it was coming. All right. And it's needed.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:19.440
We all know it's needed. All right. Just a few more stories. Loki. Yep.

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:24.440
So Roblox is doing some work to try to improve the graphics

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:29.440
in the game. So they've, I guess, done some slight changes

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:34.440
to how some of the materials are displayed in game. So the way kind

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:39.440
of Roblox works with like building stuff, they have different materials which would have different like

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.440
lighting on them. And then with that, you basically create an object and then

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:49.440
say, OK, this is concrete, this is rubber or whatever. And they have

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:54.440
different physics effects and stuff like that. So now the lighting is slightly different.

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.440
Honestly, I'm looking at the two screenshots here. It's like the new one looks darker.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:04.440
It's like The Last of Us remaster. It's not not night

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:09.440
and day different, honestly. Cool. It'll look nicer.

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.440
I don't know. Yeah, that's cool for those people that like that, but I am not

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:21.440
one of those people. It's yeah, I mean, like it's they say it's like a materials

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.440
update, like I'm looking at the screenshots here and like. It

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:31.440
it's slightly better. I mean, like I don't know.

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:36.440
Zen Monkey 11 in chat says don't try to fix what ain't broken Roblox. You're going to fuck it up.

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:41.440
You know, I don't think it's I don't think you're going to fuck it up. I think what they're doing is they're just making it so

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:46.440
that because I mean, a lot of the people that make these games in Roblox are kids and they don't know

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:51.440
like how to light stuff correctly and stuff. They're just using kind of the templates and stuff that they have.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.440
So all they're doing is just taking that and making it look a little bit better. Kind of think of like

01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:01.440
I guess adding shaders to Minecraft a little bit. Not not to that

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:06.440
extent, but like, you know, it's still the same game, but

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:11.440
they're like lighting it a little bit better or they're adding, you know, some, you know,

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:16.440
sub scatter, you know, reflections and stuff like that just to help

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:21.440
make it pop a little bit. Kind of, you know, update it a bit.

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:26.440
It's a pretty old game at this point. All right.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:31.440
Well, how about an old band in a new but an amazing band,

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:36.440
the best band of all time, in my opinion, in a rather new franchise, which honestly

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:41.440
was a franchise I did not even know about until I had seen this story.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:46.440
But it's the Let's Sing franchise and they are going to be getting

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:51.440
an ABBA game is coming out for Let's Sing. Unfortunately, I do not have

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:56.440
footage of Let's Sing ABBA, but I do have footage I can show here on Twitch of Let's Sing

01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:01.440
Queen, which, you know, is also pretty cool. But this game came out in 2020.

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.440
But you can get an idea. Yes, it's another karaoke game that is available and

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:10.440
it looks a lot like Sing Star.

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:15.440
It looks a lot like Sing Star. Yeah, it looks to me it's not

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:20.440
developed by the same people, but I want to know if it's even like maybe some of the

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:25.440
Sing Star hasn't been around for years now. They got rid of that. I wonder if it isn't some of the same people that

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:30.440
worked on that because there's a very similar vibe going on with Let's Sing.

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:35.440
So Let's Sing has been around since like the Wii. So yeah, it's the same

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:40.440
the same type of vibe like that they've been doing. Yeah, this was it's it's a

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:45.440
you know, a third party kind of karaoke game thing.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:50.440
But I mean, Sing Star is gone. And so now it's like, hey, all these competition, all the competition's gone.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:55.440
Cool. Now they can probably pull out these bigger titles. Well, it's interesting to me, though,

01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.440
that they're even taking the same trajectory as Sing Star because Sing Star

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:05.440
had a queen version and then they had an ABBA version. And that's what Dark Saga is talking about is the videos of me

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:10.440
singing and doing Sing Star ABBA back in the day, which I had on PlayStation 3. Of course I bought that. Of course

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:15.440
I bought that game. You had witnesses in person or was that the dance game? That was the dance game. There was the dance game.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:21.440
I never. Yeah, that was the dance game on the Wii. They also tried to do Let's Dance as well.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.440
They tried to compete against Just Dance and that's just never going to happen. That's right.

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:31.440
OK. But anyway, so even though I'm showing Let's Sing Queen on the screen,

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:36.440
Let's Sing ABBA is coming out and it's expected on the switch later this year.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:41.440
It will have 30 ABBA hits, including one from Voyage,

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:46.440
the latest album, because, as you know, ABBA put out a new album this year for the first time

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.440
since 1982, which is wild. But I'm thrilled,

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:56.440
obviously. They didn't say which song from Voyage is in it, but I'm assuming it's either Don't Shut Me Down

01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:01.440
or the ballad that was the single, which in the moment I can't.

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:06.440
I still have faith in you. I'm like, where did the ABBA fan go? OK.

01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:11.440
But also, you know, and they also say in this game, of course, they're going to have Mama Mia,

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:16.440
Dancing Queen, Waterloo, Money, Money, Money. Thank you for the music. The winner

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:21.440
takes it all. Take a chance on me and more. Of course, we don't know how much it costs yet,

01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.440
but I'll still be buying it. But will it have my favorite ABBA song?

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:32.440
Does anyone remember my favorite ABBA song? It was a single, but it wasn't a well-known single.

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.440
It was in Sing Star ABBA, so I'm hoping it'll be in this one. But something

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.440
You can never pronounce? Something got bumped. Are you thinking Chiquitita? Not that one.

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:48.440
Not that one. That's a great song, though. But I'm going to say that about every ABBA song. I don't know if there's an ABBA song I don't like.

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:53.440
So, well, the Christmas one on the new album is a little meh, but I love ABBA.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:58.440
Thank you for the music, is it? I love that song, but no. My favorite,

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:06.440
especially, I was going to say the winner takes it all when Meryl Streep sings it in the movie.

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:13.440
But no, my favorite ABBA song is When All is Said and Done from The Visitors.

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:19.440
And that's the one that they let Pierce Brosnan sing in the movie because they added it from the musical,

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.440
and I wish they hadn't, to be quite honest.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.440
Didn't I give you a copy of Supertrooper on vinyl?

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:31.440
Oh, yes, you did. You did. That's right, I did. Yeah.

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:35.440
I found it at a thrift store, and I was like, Rob needs this, and then I didn't give it to you for two years.

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:41.440
I bought The Visitors when I was in Seattle on vinyl, because that's my favorite ABBA album is The Visitors,

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.440
which includes that song.

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:50.440
I just happened to find an ABBA album, and I'm like, Rob wants this, I'm sure. And if he doesn't, then he's gonna.

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:55.440
ZenMonkey11 says, I want that ABBA song Madonna stole the beat from. Shit is dope.

01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:00.440
Well, it's all over, Gimme Gimme Gimme a Man After Midnight is the song you're looking for.

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:07.440
That is also, the erotic version is in my rotation during my stream.

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:15.440
That erotic cover of, and I'm not talking about erotic, the description, I'm talking about the 90s band that was,

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:18.440
well, they're back now as everything from the 90s is, but they're in DDR.

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:23.440
They're all over DDR, like, you know, their songs from back in the day are all over DDR.

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:28.440
But that band did a cover of ABBA albums, and it's actually really fucking good.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.440
It's really good.

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:32.440
Their cover of Angel Eyes is amazing.

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:36.440
I love, actually, their cover of Take a Chance on Me.

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:41.440
Yeah, like, honestly, that erotic ABBA album is fucking a bop.

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.440
Like, I think it's on Spotify now.

01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.440
It's on Apple Music.

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:48.440
Yeah, I was gonna say, if it's on Spotify, then it's also on Apple Music and all the other big ones.

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:56.440
So it's definitely worth checking out if you even somewhat enjoy ABBA and or erotic.

01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:01.440
That's just absolutely delightful.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.440
Yeah.

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:07.440
So, of course, now the chat is asking, as Joe 100 Matt says, so let's sing ABBA stream when?

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.440
That is if Twitch even lets you do it.

01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:11.440
That's a good question.

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:13.440
I'm willing to do it.

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:15.440
I don't know if Bobby will let me.

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:17.440
I'm willing to do it.

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.440
We probably would just have to delete the archive.

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:21.440
Like, we probably couldn't even have an archive.

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:27.440
Rob, I will let you know a couple of fun things which I do with my channel.

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:30.440
You can exclude audio from a VOD.

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:35.440
You can also choose to have it not go to VOD, I think.

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.440
Yeah, that's true.

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440
We could just turn VODs off for that night.

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:39.440
Yeah.

01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:46.440
But I always have, because, you know, I play a playlist in my background that could be any number of copyrighted things.

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:54.440
But you just set your advanced settings to have your audio routing go a slightly different way.

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:59.440
So, you have a VOD track and you have a live track.

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.440
So, it's pretty easy.

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.440
I'll show you.

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.440
Maybe, maybe.

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.440
So, okay.

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.440
I mean, I'm open to it.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:12.440
It would be a fun channel point reward type of thing, which, by the way, we still owe the listeners an Orange Launch Fudio.

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:19.440
We all know why it got delayed, and it got delayed for good reason, but we got to plan a date for that at some point so we can start doing channel point rewards again.

01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:21.440
So, all right.

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:25.440
Anyway, let's see ABBA coming out at some point.

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.440
Will I buy it?

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.440
Of course I will.

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:28.440
Okay.

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:33.440
If they release it here, but I think it said it's coming out here as well as Europe and all that, so why wouldn't I get it?

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.440
All right.

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:35.440
Let's go to the listener roundtable.

01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:44.440
Every week, we invite you to participate, whether it's in Discord over Twitch, or, excuse me, vognetwork.com slash Discord, or via our email bag.

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:48.440
Participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send us an email.

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.440
I actually see a caller already in the green room.

01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.440
So, Dark Soccer, if you don't mind, before we do the mailbag, I'm going to go to our caller here.

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.440
So, let's go to our caller.

01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:58.440
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.440
Who's this?

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:05.440
Of course, any good discussion about ABBA also includes Erotic and Madonna and all of those sorts of things.

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:10.440
Hey, they've influenced so many people.

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:12.440
It's pretty wild.

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.440
You're not kidding.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.440
VXJ6V.

01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:15.440
Hey, Jason.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:16.440
It's good to hear from you.

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.440
What's up, my friend?

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:25.440
So, I have a little bit of a mea culpa, and I also wanted to expand on what I said in the intro.

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:26.440
Okay.

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:34.440
Because 30 seconds, more like 22 with my standard rap and all that kind of stuff.

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:46.440
So, when I did the intro about two hours before showtime, and when I did it as usual, I went through a couple of rewrites, and I had to delete a leading one or two sentences.

01:45:46.440 --> 01:46:02.440
And when I was listening to it in context of the show starting, I was thinking, wow, that scam call out is really, really shitty, really fear-mongery, really just like, where the hell did that come from after what is ostensibly a very good feature that Twitch is working on?

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:05.440
The charity donations, if that wasn't obvious already.

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:12.440
And I wanted to add a few more of my thoughts on why I wrote that the way it is.

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:23.440
The first draft had a leading paragraph that was talking about, I wonder how much scamming I don't know about in charity donation circles.

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:37.440
The couple of versions in particular I'm thinking about that is like, whenever there's a big natural disaster, you have people on the road, I'm collecting for a Red Cross, just on random roads anywhere.

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:46.440
And don't give to those people, give to the Red Cross directly. If there is a location near you, that's great. Obviously, online is everything.

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:56.440
But somebody that paints a Red Cross on a bucket on the side of the road, don't give your money to them. Always, always, always go to the source.

01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:09.440
This is a huge thing with charity donations and stuff is that you have to be able to trust, because oftentimes you're donating to somebody's PayPal, and then they're going to take that money and you just have to trust that they donate it.

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:20.440
I've seen some Twitch streamers, what they do is they'll be like, okay, hooray, we raised $85 for this. And then they post a screenshot of their donation to, I mean, we know those can be faked.

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:27.440
But we trust that most people are pretty genuine. But there is that keyword, trust, that's very important.

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:39.440
A lot will have actually a link to the charity that works through Twitch. So you follow the link through the Twitch chat, it takes you to the official donation page.

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.440
Well, I was going to say a lot of-

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.440
Tiltify is one of the big ones I think out there.

01:47:42.440 --> 01:48:00.440
Well, I was also going to point out like the big fundraiser I think we think of with Twitch is Games Done Quick, an awesome Games Done Quick. And when you donate for that, you do donate to a PayPal, but you're donating directly to the Doctors Without Borders PayPal, or the other charity Prevent Cancer Foundation.

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:18.440
You're donating directly to those, basically, but it's tracked on the Games Done Quick website and it sort of ties together. So it knows that you donated through them, but you are putting the money right there in their PayPal, if that makes sense.

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:32.440
Yep. A streamer friend of mine back in 2016 or 2017 wanted to raise money for the RSPCA. She's up in British Columbia. She wanted to donate to the RSPCA.

01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:54.440
There was a lot of big news about multiple, just a hoarder houses, I don't remember if they were breeders or not, but like just houses that really fell off the way. And there were hundreds of cats, hundreds of animals across multiple raids and recovery and all that kind of stuff. And she really wanted to donate to the RSPCA.

01:48:54.440 --> 01:49:23.440
And I knew her personally, I was a moderator of her channel. I give her all of the benefit of the doubt, all of us in the community did, we're a tight knit community, all that kind of stuff. And she did also make the donation in person, posed with a staff member with a big novelty check with everything, signed in all of their, all of the commemoration and proof was there, admittedly, after the fact, which is always the problem.

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:45.440
And so that's just kind of like where my mind went. We see all the big news with GDQ, 2 million, 3 million, the number only continues. I wonder about how many chargebacks and stuff that they have to deal with. It's probably a lot. Obviously, they're not really going to report on that. I haven't looked at their full disclosure fundamentals or anything like that.

01:49:46.440 --> 01:50:09.440
But there's a lot of detail out there. And this tugs on a lot of things that I deal with professionally and feel personally and all those sorts of things that know who you're giving to, know why you're giving to them. Don't do it just because they say so. If they say it's going to XYZ Corporation charity, all that kind of stuff, do that.

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:22.440
Another couple of things that I'd like to say, just in general, if you use Amazon, go to smile.amazon.com. Pick a charity, put your money towards a charity.

01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:24.440
Except for AbleGamers.

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:28.440
Yep, I do charity water. I've cared about that for quite some time.

01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:30.440
I'm putting all of mine into Abortion Fund.

01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:50.440
Yeah, there's a ton of great resources out there. The reason why this is U.S. only, because Twitch is a U.S. company, and the good thing about the U.S. is the 501c3 and c4 registrations, like the legal system is out there for you to be able to look at this information very quickly and very easily.

01:50:51.440 --> 01:51:10.440
Even such that the couple of Twitch Cons that I've gone to when I saw, I don't remember if it was Tiltify, but they had these little, all of the charities in the wing of the main hall of Twitch Con had these little credit card bucket looking things that were donations.

01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:25.440
It was like, hey, $1, $5, $10, just drop your card in here. That is an example of technology, awesome technology benefiting people where you come by and boop, we know how to drop a card in, bam.

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:29.440
You get a pleasant little sound, you get the reaction of everybody else there.

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:33.440
Don't give this up to Salvation Army, just saying that.

01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:50.440
Agreed, but where your policies and feelings and motives align, do your research so that you're not getting ripped off and benefiting somebody else. The information is out there, please make sure you're making use of it.

01:51:51.440 --> 01:52:01.440
I think this is going to be nice when it is more embedded within Twitch. I think Twitch can see that so much of their community is getting involved with this anyway, that it's just something they should be on top of.

01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:12.440
And just to weed out that bad apple in the barrel, because all it takes is one to really ruin it for people that want to question everything after that point. And rightfully so, I get it.

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:24.440
So Twitch being able to kind of like legitimize that by people knowing that it's going to the charity because it's through Twitch and you point out how Twitch already, Amazon owns Twitch and already has the charity stuff built into it.

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:38.440
And yes, use Smile. I mean, I can't tell you which charity to donate to. There's 1000 great causes on Smile Amazon, you have to speak what speaks to you. And that's that no one can tell you what to do, you have to pick the one that's right for you.

01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:44.440
But pick somebody if you are using Amazon.

01:52:44.440 --> 01:53:02.440
Be very careful though, because some of them on there, especially like with the ones I've been dealing with for abortion funds, they are very deceptively named. Look them up, look up their paperwork before you select it.

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:28.440
Yeah, so many things like, I don't remember if it was just last February when the Supreme Court decision was leaked. But yeah, those same kind of things as like, when somebody, when some organization's name gets big in the news, you're going to have a bunch of similar looking name pop ups like this, this will always be around because this is always a social problem.

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:38.440
Like the name looks close enough to trick you into giving your money over to something that is scamming you out of your donation, your good intent.

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:59.440
And the more vetted that platforms make it the better it gets us 90% of the way there the last 10% is on the individual to verify and do it and do it the way that really like verifies and proves that you did what you wanted to do to the people you wanted to have your donation.

01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:06.440
All right, very good tips, Jason. Appreciate it and appreciate the intro making and all that good stuff as always.

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:07.440
Always, always.

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:10.440
All right. Take care, my friend. We'll talk to you soon.

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.440
Have a great night, everyone.

01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:12.440
You too.

01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:32.440
All right. Let's go back to, not that shot, this one. Let's go back and visit our mailbag. Participate at orangelandtrader.com is the place that you can send us an email week after week after week. Participate at orangelandtrader.com. And I believe there's at least one in there today, right?

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:45.440
There is a list of three things but there's only two items listed but I'll read it. Hello one and all quick story for you. Last night I was at a friend's house for a birthday party at his house there's a DDR third mix machine in the living room.

01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:56.440
The only difference is that there's a computer attached to it with step mania I was asked by someone to join them for a few rounds, played 1.5 Difficult. The machine has tons of custom original tracks, including other DDR mixes.

01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:08.440
I don't remember all the songs I played, but it did get me to thinking, and a question to all of you, what three songs would you play in DDR? Here's my choices. So number one isn't on the list, I'm just saying.

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:22.440
Number two, Princes of the Universe by Queen and number three, nonfiction by Liella. Kind of eclectic, but I like it. That's it. Stay cool. Really hating this heatwave and stay awesome. That came from Ranchan.

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.440
Always good to hear from Ranchan.

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:42.440
Gosh, my three. They're probably all on my playlist. I would probably say Days of Thunder by The Midnight.

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:47.440
I'd also say maybe Stars by Kylie.

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:50.440
One of my favorite songs.

01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:02.440
Maybe Star Worshipper, the Leno remix by Future Cop.

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:08.440
I'm also going to throw in one another and say Money by Mystery Skulls.

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:20.440
This is a really hard one for me because my brain kind of wants to go back to that era of DDR music in the 90s and 2000s and kind of pick songs in that area.

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:29.440
Well, we never did get an ABBA song officially in DDR, so you know I want Dancing Queen in DDR. So there's that.

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:49.440
Let's see. What else would I love to see in DDR? I would love to see something like, there's a lot of, see when I go back to that era, I'm like I wanted more like Vincent D'Amour stuff because like Ghost is probably like one of my all time favorite songs or more echo image songs because there's a lot of echo image stuff, you know, but it's kind of like more of the same that was already in DDR.

01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:56.440
So I guess I go and I say like, I would love to have a bop from Robin, you know, has always had some danceable songs.

01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:59.440
Something for Robin and Roiksop.

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:15.440
Yeah, I was just actually Roiksop was another band I was gonna say I would love to have a song by them. Yeah, so I don't know or like, yeah, I think there's so many good songs that would work out but it all depends on what they can license right?

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:22.440
Yeah, Roiksop and how you pronounce your name, Sundafar? Never Ever?

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:23.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.440
That would be a good one too.

01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:31.440
They just had a new album come out too, Roiksop did so because they have a Goldfrapp song on there now.

01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:35.440
So we know how we like Goldfrapp.

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:37.440
Absolutely, I love Goldfrapp.

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:42.440
So Loki, what about you? What three songs did you put in DDR?

01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:54.440
I don't know. I have a DDR machine that can put any songs I want on there. Like, I don't really know what I would put on there. That's, that's, that's too open ended. Like, I'll just play some of the stuff that other people make.

01:57:54.440 --> 01:58:03.440
I would do a DDR machine where the only song you can play is conga feeling. That's it. It's a conga feeling machine. That's the only song you're allowed to play.

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:11.440
What was that day back on a fourth mix at RVGL where I think someone played like the kick, either kick the can or the seven jump over and over?

01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:12.440
I think it was the seven jump.

01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:13.440
Usually kick the can.

01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:14.440
Yeah.

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.440
That was special.

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:18.440
Good times.

01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:24.440
Uh, SG100Matt is suggesting Loki fusion mixes. You, you had some really awesome mixes back in the day. I kind of miss that you.

01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:27.440
Yeah, they don't make great sim files though, unfortunately.

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:29.440
Did you ever put them on YouTube? You should put those on YouTube.

01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:30.440
Uh, no.

01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:31.440
Just put them up there.

01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:33.440
They would probably get claimed pretty fast.

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:37.440
So let them claim. Uh, I guess you wouldn't want to do it on your Minecraft channel because you're really trying to build that.

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:38.440
No.

01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:40.440
Have a second. Have a throwaway account.

01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:43.440
Sure.

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:48.440
All right. Um, okay. So thank you for the email. Appreciate that. That was the only one, right?

01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:49.440
Yeah.

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:59.440
Okay. So we can go to our, uh, chat and get some questions from our chat as well. So no one special is back. Hello. Hello. And says question.

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:10.440
Have you three ever bought a game going in knowing full well it's bad, but enjoyed it nonetheless? That's an interesting one.

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:16.440
Have you ever bought a game knowing it would be bad, but still enjoying it nonetheless?

01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:25.440
I feel like if I bought it and everybody said it was bad, it was something I was still wanting to defend.

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:29.440
Um, no, I definitely have bought games that I know are bad.

01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.440
Sneak King comes to mind.

01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:34.440
No, no, that's not bad. We talked about it. That's a great game.

01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:37.440
Everybody said it was bad when it came out.

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:38.440
It's creepy.

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:39.440
Yeah. Sneak King.

01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:40.440
It's not bad.

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:42.440
Bobby agrees with me. Just said it in chat.

01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:52.440
Uh, no, like I've definitely purchased Steam games because I knew they were bad. Like, um, the long drive.

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:58.440
There's a perfect example. Uh, the gas station simulator.

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.440
Pixel Poops volume two.

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:05.440
Yeah, exactly. You know.

02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:12.440
Let's see. Naughty Bear says pod culture. That's a good answer. I remember that one.

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:26.440
Um, I, I can't think of any that I played on purpose that they were bad because I mean, some games other people may not like and you think that they're super fun. So no perception.

02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:32.440
No Man's Sky. Everybody shit on that game when it came out and I didn't, I didn't hate it. I didn't love it.

02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:40.440
But now I love it, you know, all this time later. But I feel like that's a cheaty answer because you could say, I could say that with a lot of games where they got shit on when they first came out.

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:52.440
Diablo three, Final Fantasy 14, but they're, they're good games now. Right? So those would all fit into that as well. Pod culture says Yaris. I'm sorry. Nobody actually liked Yaris.

02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:58.440
You didn't purchase that. That was free.

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:14.440
Um, S. Joe and Hunter Matt says Garfield go, even though it was free to play. I, you know what? A mobile phone game could absolutely count. I bet there's hella mobile phone games that get a shitty rap, but people enjoy them anyway. For sure. So.

02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:18.440
A lot of the Earth Defense Force games could be really bad.

02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:29.440
Yeah. Um, Oh, Tiger Claw and chat says they were a lot of NES games that were bad, but we bought them because you looked at the box and admire the graphics. So you thought it would be a good game.

02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.440
Back to the future two and three. That was an awful game.

02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:36.440
I remember everybody hated Festers Quest, but I kind of liked it.

02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:37.440
And it was great.

02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:44.440
It didn't click for me for years later that I was like, Festers Quest was just the overhead parts of Blaster Master as a game.

02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:52.440
If Festers Quest was just the overhead parts of Blaster Master, they took out the side scroll part and they took all the overhead part and made it its own game.

02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:58.440
So yeah, it's just basically Festers Quest is a sequel to Blaster Master.

02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:01.440
It's in the same universe.

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:03.440
It's in the same universe as well. Yes, it is.

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:09.440
Bobby Blackwell says, I'm surprised Loki didn't say Saints Row 4. Well, Loki didn't like that game.

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:14.440
I didn't buy that knowing it was bad. I bought it and then found out it was bad.

02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:25.440
All right. If you have any other questions for us, twitch.tv slash vog network, I'll give it another minute here to see if any other questions come in here.

02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:28.440
But I remember the wrestling game so bad that when we rented it, we took it back.

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.440
That was that WCW thunder.

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:39.440
Oh, God. Yeah, I remember renting games that would end up being terrible, but you just I never I mean, I was bad enough.

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:44.440
We took it back. It was my mom never liked Blockbuster for some reason.

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.440
My mom, because all these people have fond memories of Blockbuster.

02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:49.440
My mom refused to go there. She hated them for some reason.

02:02:49.440 --> 02:03:00.440
So I never really got to experience that. We did go to Hollywood video, but I don't think I ever but it was always like mom and pop stores like the local chain Plaster TV.

02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:02.440
We went to for a long time. They didn't rent games, though.

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:09.440
We had a Curtis Mathis store in Dothan, Alabama, that my granny would take us to for rentals.

02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:11.440
That's fun. Yeah.

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:17.440
I think I rented the same copy of Return of the Jedi over and over and over and over because it is my favorite Star Wars flick.

02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:19.440
Nice. Nice.

02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:27.440
Let's see. Mike Deff says, What about the opposite games that everyone likes that you hate?

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:29.440
Oh, this is.

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:33.440
A game that everyone likes that you don't like.

02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:37.440
Halo. I don't I don't like Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask.

02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:39.440
I don't like it. You went right for it.

02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:42.440
You I don't like any Nintendo 64 or Zelda games.

02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:44.440
Wow.

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:47.440
I'm sure there's something in there.

02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:49.440
There's something in there.

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:51.440
There's something in there.

02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:53.440
There's something in there.

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:55.440
There's something in there.

02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.440
There's something in there.

02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:59.440
I'm sure there's something.

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:01.440
I don't know why I'm drawing a blank in the minute.

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:07.440
See, I want to take the easy answers and do things like Madden and the sports games, but I feel like that's a cop out.

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:10.440
Oh, oh,

02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:13.440
Saga Frontier.

02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:18.440
I never liked that. I don't like the Saga series and people really like that.

02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:21.440
And I did like it. Yeah, I was like, it's suicide.

02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:23.440
It's like, oh, Square Enix game.

02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:30.440
I played them like, oh, no, I'm kind of with the folks in chat saying the Souls games, the soul.

02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:33.440
Yeah. Oh, oh, any of the tactics games?

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:38.440
I don't like tactics games, including I don't like Final Fantasy Tactics tactics games.

02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:41.440
See, that's the one I'll let slide.

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:44.440
But otherwise, I'm not a big fan of this way.

02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:52.440
I don't even like the Macross game that came out on PC Engine and I love almost anything of the old Macross games.

02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:53.440
So.

02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:59.440
All right. Well, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap things up tonight.

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:01.440
I know it was a little shorter tonight, but that's all right.

02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:04.440
I'm still kind of feeling like I'm ready to to wrap up for the night.

02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:07.440
So that'll work. But thank you all for being here.

02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:11.440
Thank you for listening to the show, whether you were here live or you joined us on the podcast feed.

02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:15.440
Thank you so much for downloading and checking out Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:19.440
If you like what you heard on the show, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:22.440
Excuse me, help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:25.440
but the voices have to be here for us to put out on air.

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:30.440
So please tell a friend or two a tweet or social media post goes a long way.

02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:35.440
I really appreciate that. Even hosting, even though hosting on Twitch is kind of not what it used to be.

02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:39.440
We'll still take them here at Vogue Network and I really appreciate that stuff.

02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:41.440
So thank you. Thank you.

02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:44.440
We'll be back in seven days to do it again.

02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:46.440
I guess we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:48.440
Oh, actually, I should check with Loki. I'm sorry. Last minute stories.

02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:51.440
I forgot to sidebar it, but do you have any last minute stories, Loki?

02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:53.440
Uh, no.

02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:55.440
OK, then we will get final thoughts.

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:58.440
All right, DarkSakura, your final thoughts, because I know you're going to stream.

02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:02.440
Um, yeah, words.

02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:03.440
OK.

02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:05.440
Later taters.

02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:06.440
Bye.

02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:08.440
I couldn't think of anything. Sorry.

02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:11.440
No, you're fine. It's only a segment we do every week. No, I'm just kidding.

02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:16.440
Yeah, but my brain is like, I'm looking at a freeze frame of midnight and I'm like, I love my cat.

02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:18.440
That's it. I love my cat.

02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:19.440
There you go. There you go.

02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:20.440
Yeah.

02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:22.440
All right. Have a good stream. We'll see a little bit later.

02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:26.440
All right. And Loki, I actually how about my final thought?

02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:31.440
My final thought is I would like to know what fucking went and changed all the settings on my computer,

02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:35.440
including these different shots I'd carefully curated within OBS.

02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:39.440
And just tonight, it just decided to reset all my shots and make them square.

02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:43.440
So now I'm having to like a dummy recraft them as we're live on air.

02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:46.440
But whatever. Anyway, that's my final thought.

02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:50.440
Why do why do things have to be complicated? Why can't things just work?

02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:52.440
Why can't they work? All right.

02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:54.440
It's I guess.

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:57.440
Loki, last but not least, your final thought.

02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:02.440
I wish there was some files for the dance or the step maniac stuff.

02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:05.440
I get it. It's Kyle Ward and all them.

02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:08.440
And they want to support that because it's a great indie game.

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:09.440
It's doing well.

02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:10.440
But.

02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:13.440
But also, I want to play them on my cabinet.

02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:16.440
And so, yeah.

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.440
All right.

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.440
I want them.

02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:19.440
All right.

02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.440
I'll pay for them.

02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:26.440
I like you can't tell me that that I'm sure that Kevin is running like step mania and some.

02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:30.440
You know, capacity is like, you know, just offer them.

02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:33.440
It will pay for them.

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:38.440
All right. We'll be back in seven days to do this all over again.

02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:42.440
Why did the date suddenly revert to our 20th anniversary show?

02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:44.440
Everything is broken on this computer.

02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:48.440
Everything is broken. I'm done. Shut it down. Shut it down.

02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:51.440
See you in seven days. Bye.

02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:55.440
