00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This week we again learned that video gamers are more likely to have better decision making skills and that gaming enhances brain function.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Like physically, verbally, and plenty of other forms of working out that you can see, mental exercise exists too.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Exercising the ability to take in multiple sources of information and use or react to them when needed is a beneficial trait of human function.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is just one story in tonight's news. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Today's show is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 924 of our show for tonight, July the 31st, 2022.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's not quite August, but almost. Hi, I'm Rob Roberts and joining me to talk about video games, gaming culture, all that good stuff are my co-hosts.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hi.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hi. I like your shirt by the way today that you're wearing as we are taping live at Vogue Network. Yeah, tacos are my favorite emotion. That's great.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Perfect.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
One of my most comfortable shirts at that. I believe in comfort today.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Can you quickly, since this is a food show in addition to video games, can you quickly describe the perfect taco?

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Del Taco chicken soft tacos.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay. You know what the perfect taco for me is?

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hmm.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The Choco Taco and that's why they got rid of it because I liked it.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No, they actually put out an official statement about it.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, did they?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, it was something about like being able to preserve a legacy stock of it or something.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't know.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's dumb.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Release the Choco Tacos.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's avoid the ableist terms.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Release the Choco Tacos.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But it was some article that I just like half glanced at it on Twitter.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Mm hmm.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
All right.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hello.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hi, Loki.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How are you?

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I am fine.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So you do always have a little video of a game playing behind you because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash Vogue Network, VOG Network.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We're right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, except not tonight.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Bobby wasn't on tonight.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He had the week off due to family obligations.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So his 17th birthday episode got to last an extra week on his podcast feed.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But we're here tonight and watching Loki having some.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is that stunt driving or hard drive and playing behind you?

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's one of the Atari racing games.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's neither.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, it's Broderbund and it's stunts is the game.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, okay.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So, okay.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But to be fair, that was like their rip off of better rendered.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, it was it was their their rip off of stunt driving.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Because, you know, just like when a game is popular, like a lot of clones are made of it.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That was no different in the late 90s with like stunt driving and how huge that game was.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You mean that game was popular?

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, yeah.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In arcades and stuff.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, God.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That game was hugely popular.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I had never saw anyone playing it.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, yeah.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And again, we also had one at my arcade when I was actually working there and it was the nap machine.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now, it was dark.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It was dark.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, you also have to remember that that game like they tried to port that game to the Super Nintendo.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And I mean, tried.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Like, yeah, it was gold star.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You tried energy like.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, I know.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But I just never remembered that game getting a lot of play when it was new when I was going to arcades.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It might have also been one of those things where like maybe it was remembered a little bit more for its tech and how it pushed the boundaries that it did maybe its popularity.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But I think I think maybe it was popular just in certain places or circles or what have you.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But people like people love the idea of driving a loop to loop.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That was the first game, first popular game.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sure it wasn't the very first game to drive a loop to loop.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But it was the first one, you know, that you had to run into the way to do it without crashing.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And that game was hard.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So this game is hard, too, but it's cool because it has a track editor.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I used to play this as a kid a long time ago, as you could tell by the graphics.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
One of the fun things to do with that is to put a bunch of 45 degree ramps.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think I don't remember if it was like a bridge or if there's something that had to do with 45 degree ramps and you would put a bunch of those in a big old line and it would basically boost your speed up infinitely.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You could go like a thousand miles an hour or something like that.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
OK.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You know what I'm realizing now that I'm seeing more than just the driving parts of the game, then seeing like the UI and the fake profiles of the people and stuff.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I had this game on PC like years on my first like PC.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I had this game for sure.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's funny.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, it was fun.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't think I ever played the actual racing part.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I just like building done tracks.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And that's so you, though.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's so you.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You always love to mod and build.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And that's why, like, even though I know you're kind of like, oh, I did Minecraft again this week.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It doesn't really surprise me because that game kind of calls to that crowd who want to build and mod and do all that.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's what Minecraft is.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So it doesn't doesn't really surprise me.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You've you've surprised me.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Took you there.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Took you so long.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There it is right there.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So there's the jump right there.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So it's a it's an open bridge.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That was the one that that you put a bunch of them in a row and then it would chain it.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And then also they had the pipe.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, I remember that.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I go up on the walls.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, that's fun.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
OK, that's funny.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, hello as well to our chat, because as I mentioned, we do tape live on Sunday nights at Vogue Network on Twitch and some folks talking about hard drive in and stunt drive in and that stuff.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So dark to you says there was a prototype of an NES version of hard drive in.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, God, unless they remade it as a 2D game, it must have been terrible.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Like like Rad Racer was what we had as far as like 3D, I guess.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I mean, Rad Racer was kind of cool.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And I don't mean the literal 3D thing they were trying with the glasses, but like that, you know, first person type of thing they were doing.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, I don't know.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But then I guess I guess we think about it like first person racing games are as old as gaming in many ways, because like pole position goes how far back.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And that was essentially first person.

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean, it was, you know, over the car.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But still, still those games go way back.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
S.G. 100 Matt says, I was a fan of it in the arcade.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It was hard, but it was neat for its time.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I think that it was it was the novelty of the bridge hopping and the the you know, because remember right around that same time with the bridge hopping, what was the huge movie Speed where they actually did that with the bus or Spice World where they also did that when the bus.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So people, you know, that hopping bridges was huge in the 90s.

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't try this at home.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
S.G. 100 Matt reminds me of this other thing about those games is that I liked the gimmick of that.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In order to start the game, you had to turn a legit car key.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That was a thing that was on those games.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But like I also remember like Spy Hunter had like all the buttons and the different mechanisms and things.

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So, you know, kind of having that very immersive sort of setup goes way back with games.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So that's that's awesome.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
All right.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Nice trip down memory lane.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Love it.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I know we're going to talk about more classic games in just a little bit because Dark Sakura, I'm sure has something to say about them.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm not just talking about her segment, but we'll come back to that.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let's start off tonight with our kickoff topic, which is about TikTok.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We couldn't swing the pendulum harder.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We've gone from classic games to games on a service that because I'm over the age of 40, maybe I don't understand as much as other people.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But then again, I joke.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Dark Sakura, you post content on it.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I I watch it, but I I don't know how to find good content.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I get linked to good content all the time.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't really know how to find it.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You actually post content on TikTok, right, Jamie?

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I do.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I meant to post some stuff from yesterday, but the Internet was kind of crap.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah.

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So I didn't.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That I was too busy playing games and being in pain.

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, well, we'll talk.

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Mind is young.

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Body is not.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We'll talk more about that in a minute.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But so I think we've had some stories on previous episodes of OLR that talked about that TikTok is trying to get into more gaming.

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And this isn't the first time that we've seen social media because we know Facebook has tried to get into gaming.

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Hell, Google Plus.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Remember that that was Google getting into some of that gaming and they had their own unique approach to it and so forth.

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You know, getting games involved in social media is not a new concept.

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So the fact that TikTok is trying to get into it shouldn't be that surprising.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But something with the volume of TikTok and because, you know, again, even though we joke that we're all over 40 and we barely use it, the reality is the younger crowd, you know, teens, early 20s and, you know, kind of all the in-betweens really use TikTok like a lot.

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So getting games under the service is not incredibly surprising.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What's a little newer this week is that the testing is getting more broad and we're actually seeing what some of these games look like.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So in a spokesperson for TikTok in an interview at TechCrunch said, currently, we're exploring bringing HTML5 games to TikTok through integrations with third-party game developers and studios.

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
One of the games that they're testing is from a company called Aim Lab, and the game they're making is called Mr. Aim Lab's Nightmare.

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Except now here's the thing that I'll show for those that are watching live on Twitch, I'll show like a little clip of this.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So they actually have like a TikTok that they posted.

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Finally beat this boss in the TikTok game.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You can actually hear, sorry, the volume came through a little loud.

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But let me flip over to the other screen for those that are watching live on Twitch so you can see what this actually looks like here.

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And it let me rewind it.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It actually it looks like a cheap honestly, like a cheap little flash game to me.

179
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Like it looks like you're like tapping and describe me for the podcast, folks, you're tapping all these little objects that are flying out at the screen in order to beat some boss.

180
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So the quality of the game looks a little bit, I don't know.

181
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And again, because I'm watching on the website, it says click below to play and there actually is no place to actually play.

182
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And I notice it's actually posted, this particular video is posted by the creators of the game.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But just gives you a little bit of a sense of what, you know, those games look like.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So they're I don't know if they're not very high quality, but it's short.

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's, you know, just like TikTok videos are short attention span sort of things, right?

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And it's a start.

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, so aim aim lab.

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's a it's a software game, if you will, to like train your it's supposed to make you like better FPS games by training your aim, I guess.

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, interesting.

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So that's what they're doing.

191
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
IOS games up there, too.

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It looks like.

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh, yeah.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, I'm sure I'm sure it would be pretty easy if something was already built with mobile devices in mind.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It might be pretty easy to port that over to TikTok.

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So anyway, and that's just one example of a game.

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You know, and again, we've talked about in the past that TikTok was kind of moving the chess pieces around.

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
ByteDance, parent company, bought Moonton Technology last year.

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
TikTok had a partnership with Zynga for a game called Disco Loco 3D and a charity game I'm unaware of called Garden of Good.

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's kind of cute.

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And I guess that is actually available on U.S. TikTok.

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That charity or excuse me, the Garden of Good.

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And then HTML5 games have previously been tested in Vietnam, which is not uncommon for these large mobile developers to test things in maybe one country, one or two countries before they roll it out into the world.

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Again, this is TikTok getting behind Apple, Google, Netflix, you know, all these other folks that are in the space to move into TikTok gaming.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So my question is for the group and for the chat, do you think this is a big deal?

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Because here's the thing, I feel like these other forays by social media specifically, I think Apple, Google, that's a different category because, you know, I don't think you can compare this to like, I don't know, Apple Arcade or Stadia.

207
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's not the same thing.

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Those other things I named are not trying to embed themselves within social media.

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So when I talk about things that are embedding themselves in social media, I think about like Facebook playing the games there live on Facebook.

210
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That never really took off for anybody.

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm not sure this is really going to do that as well, but I'm not sure.

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What do you all think?

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Depends like how they're going to implement this.

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So like if they just put like, we're putting games on our platform as well.

215
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's kind of boring, because like, if you're talking about targeting audience that uses TikTok, most of those users are probably accessing it through their mobile app.

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And there's so many app stores and things that are inundating them with games that they could really play.

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That doesn't really seem like that's worthwhile.

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Now, what I see like a better way to do it, which means it's probably not the way they're going to do it.

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But let's just say that they could do it in the sense that with TikTok, you can record video and edit and do like some small stuff with that.

220
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But maybe with these games, you can record gameplay and then do commentary and stuff over that.

221
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And then you can make little clips with the game as well.

222
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That would be a meaningful use of it.

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This will just be some garbage that they try to shove ads in microtransactions down our throats with.

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes, I know they're not in it yet.

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yet is the operative term.

226
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So I don't I don't anticipate that they'll do anything meaningful with it.

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Jamie, do you have thoughts?

228
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I think it's going to be a big, big thing.

229
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I mean, yeah, it's a way to maybe even I think they're going to do it more with ad revenue built into the games or something like that.

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But I mean, I think sites are always like any kind of social media platform is going to look for increasing engagement.

231
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And I think that this is just their attempt.

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They think they put a fun game up there, whether or not they're going to make money on any kind of revenue or anything with it.

233
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's something that builds engagement and something that keeps people wanting to go back and and, oh, I can do this while I'm browsing on here.

234
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Fun, you know, that type of thing.

235
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And so I think in that respect, I mean, it's a wait and see.

236
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We don't really know enough about it anyway.

237
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So no, but I think I think you're right.

238
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's like even if the games are not a super high quality, it's keeping the eyes on TikTok longer.

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And that's one place that like TikTok kind of can pride itself right now.

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm almost positive.

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I saw some type of report that said I don't know if it was people of a certain age or all people, but like TikTok has more viewing hours right now than YouTube.

242
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And that's kind of a big that might only be in one age group.

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm sorry, I don't have to study in front of me.

244
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But, you know, the volume of TikTok is very large.

245
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And, you know, yeah, it's kind of what you're saying.

246
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If it's just like, oh, this game's just right on over here.

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's still keeping people in that TikTok bubble longer and away from the competitors, for sure.

248
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's really the goal.

249
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You know, with any kind of social media site, they need something that's going to keep a person on their site.

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And a lot of people, you know, especially for anything that may have some sort of ad embedded in it, a lot of us have trained our eyes just to ignore the ad.

251
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You know, to sort of narrow down, but it still doesn't mean we're not seeing it and that it's not on the page and being exposed to people.

252
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So, you know, I just I have this feeling that it's really just an engagement deal.

253
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You know, I don't know that TikTok needs it, though.

254
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm going to be perfectly honest.

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It was it was just so funny.

256
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I was when I was at the thing yesterday, I had there were people who were like, oh, yeah, I'm on Instagram and this.

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I'm like, are you on TikTok?

258
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, yeah, that, too.

259
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I forget about my TikTok is what I hear a lot.

260
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Then for the people that are on it, they are on it.

261
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah.

262
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And it really like I'll be honest, I have a YouTube channel.

263
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think I've posted like a couple of things that weren't private.

264
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:31,000
My TikTok needs more attention, but I've been putting like my my, you know, stream clips and stuff on there, and I've found a lot more success with that.

265
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Plus, it's easy just to make like a three minute video or a five minute video and post it up there as opposed to putting work into like a longer production.

266
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That would be of an optimal length for YouTube.

267
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And now YouTube is doing their shorts thing.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Which is supposed to, I reckon, be like the competitor with TikTok.

269
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, but TikTok success comes in with the short attention span of people these days.

270
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And I actually went in it went into studying some of this in in my design classes.

271
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If you look at all right I'm actually I'll tell you this, look at an ad for a Mac.

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Look at what they looked like in the 80s.

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You had the picture, and this entire article written in Adobe Garamond Pro.

274
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That was like this this and this and this and this and don't you feel this and blah blah blah it's like, you know, going to a recipe site.

275
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Now it's item, price, thing.

276
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And that's what our social media is turning into as well that's why people, you know, are more on Twitter, and more on TikTok.

277
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
They are smaller more digestible and built for the, the current attention span.

278
00:18:47,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And so why not have games on there, especially if they're a little clicky clicky games that require a short attention span and don't require you to become you know invested in it or something.

279
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Let me get some comments from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network Tiger Claw says, none of that would have been possible if it wasn't for Snapchat, they did it first before Facebook, Instagram and now TikTok and YouTube doing it.

280
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Well, let me, let me see.

281
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Fine.

282
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No, no one, no one here knows better.

283
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We, no one knows better than o LR that just because you're first doesn't mean you're going to be the most popular.

284
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And Snapchat was not the first to do it. No one knows that better than o LR nine and Periscope existed before Snapchat.

285
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You know DJ Rama S brings up a good point. So does that mean TikTok has fixed their algorithms for LGBT and POC creators that I remember they were getting a lot of pushback, because of those algorithms has people have people just kind of forgotten that or did

286
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
TikTok ever address that I truly don't know.

287
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There was a big, like, almost like a quote walkout. Hold on, let me double check and see if I can find anything.

288
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay, why while you're digging for that, let me get to another couple comments. Okay. Let's see, as Joe and her map points out, remember when Twitter had a live video channel didn't really last long.

289
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
If TikTok wants to take a real step into gaming, then they have to take risks and stick things out and not give it three years and trash it.

290
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You know, it's funny, there's so much video and photo content on Twitter, because the one social media I do use, and I think I've done well with is Twitter.

291
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But otherwise, I'm like the people you're talking about DarkSakura, I go, Oh, yeah, I have a TikTok. I don't know how to make compelling content for it. I really don't. So and I can admit that so

292
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You know what you need to do is put something vaguely controversial, or on the edge of taboo.

293
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But I don't know if I want to, you know, like, is that really me? I don't want to force myself to be something I'm not. I mean, I do have hot takes. But you know, I don't know.

294
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So by the way, the NPR did an article about this in February. This year, that's probably one of the more recent things I can find, but I don't find anything about it being updated.

295
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I do know the thing about POC putting up, like dance videos, you know, making those I've created this dance to the song thing, and then the white girls stealing it and making it popular. You know, but

296
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
bring it on?

297
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I was gonna say the only TikTok creator that does dance videos that I follow is Paula Abdul. I was gonna say she does some good ones.

298
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's just like everyday people who make the thing and it becomes really nice.

299
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Deidre Omas does follow up his comments saying they addressed it, but to some content creators, it wasn't enough. My other issue with TikTok is how easily they can pull your data. Some companies have blocked TikTok on corporate devices.

300
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, yeah, I mean, maybe here's my controversial hot take companies should be blocking TikTok. That website is a waste of time. That's literally its purpose is to waste time and adding games into the service is to help you waste more time.

301
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So yeah, a company who doesn't block TikTok is not on the cutting edge of it. Like honestly, unless of course your business has a reason for being on TikTok. You are the social media person for your business. Okay, don't come at me with all the exceptions. But on a general level, companies should block TikTok.

302
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:44,000
They should put cookie clicker on TikTok. It'll create a black hole vacuum of unproductivity.

303
00:22:44,000 --> 00:23:13,000
For the record, in TikTok's privacy policy, it does have a way that you can submit a request to delete collected information and also to submit requests through authorized agents to do it for you. So you can put in written requests to have your information not collected.

304
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Interesting.

305
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So there's also an opt out option for third party advertising. So that's on this other thing that I can, it's like a massive opt out service.

306
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's called like the NAI. And it's a full opt out service for digital advertising and data sales.

307
00:23:44,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Um, my, I guess, like hot take on this whole thing with TikTok or whatever, I sort of look down the road at what this might turn into in a few years. And I think what it might be, you know, the quality of the games is not great now. But, you know, what's only getting bigger is cloud gaming.

308
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And I think we've seen all of the other companies are starting to make their move really into cloud gaming, you know, whether it's Stadia, whether it's Amazon's Luna, whether it's Xbox, you know, and there's there's many others as well, right?

309
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So there's there's so many companies that are getting into cloud gaming, like, how would it I mean, wouldn't it be cool if on TikTok, you're watching Oh, I don't know, a Dead by Daylight play going on, and then tap this button to jump into a Dead by Daylight match with me right now. Or you know, whatever it is, which ironically, was one of Stadia selling points, if I remember right, was the whole

310
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Did that ever happen?

311
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Did it Jamie? You're the Stadia expert. I don't know. Like you can stream your Stadia gameplay on YouTube, and somebody can jump in and join the game with you live.

312
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah, that's on there. I don't use it. Because I'm on Twitch. And as an affiliate, I can't I can't cross.

313
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Right.

314
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But yeah, um, hold on, I'll just open up my game right now. And I'll tell you what it says. Because there's a side panel.

315
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Alright, so my Stadia thing is popping up.

316
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Okay, so first thing looking for people to play with start a public party. So there's that where you can start a public party and anyone can join in whenever.

317
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And I have open and full screen. And so on my side, I have

318
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I have windowed mode, which I'm going to go into. Alright, so I've got, I've actually got some add ons through some Chrome extensions. But yeah, there are other things on here about

319
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:56,000
live stream you there's a live stream button at the bottom that says, you know, it'll stream it to YouTube. And then I have another one at the bottom that says parties. So you can have a live party and people can jump in and out through a queue. And yeah,

320
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:16,000
see, this is fascinating to me, because I feel like this is where everybody kind of wants to be and like Google's there. But I feel like this is horrifically underutilized because of the let's be honest, Jamie, I'm sorry to say this, because I know you're a fan, but the rather lukewarm reception stadia has been getting from the gaming masses and the gaming public, you know,

321
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Google, it has been getting a lot better. Well, a lot better.

322
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, but I don't think it made our show this week. But we had another one of those Google stadia is going to get the plug pulled rumors going around this week, which obviously was fake. But I don't know if it's that people don't trust Google. I think well, I do think that's been a part of it from the very beginning.

323
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yes, it was very beginning when they launched stadia. It doesn't matter how good it was, people said, Well, Google has a track record of shutting shit down too early. So I wonder how long this is going to last to so I get that this case

324
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:14,000
is under expansion. So they've just offered Portuguese support for Brazil, full Portuguese support, they have expanded more of their, their servers, they've brought in new games, they're in talks for more games. So they're they're expanding, they're just not doing the in house stuff.

325
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Um, and you know, in speaking of some of the competitors as well, which live in a similar space to stadia, I'm really surprised that Luna being a part of Amazon with Twitch does not have that exact same feature. Like I, I'm kind of shocked that Twitch does not have the ability to click a button and join me in this game right now via Luna, the cloud streaming service that you have access to this game as Amazon Prime member, blah, blah, blah, whatever in their universe, I'm, I'm really shocked.

326
00:27:43,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That's not a feature. Now, maybe because Luna is technically still a beta or whatever, maybe that's something they're going to pull the red carpet back on at TwitchCon or something. I don't know. But I'm just I'm really surprised. That's not a thing yet. And I'm sure it's a matter of time. And then of course, why did Microsoft get rid of their streaming service? That was dumb, because they could have, you know, incorporated the x cloud into that, but maybe they have another plan. I don't know.

327
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Silly, silly.

328
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Make sure that we avoid the ableist terms. Do you think I'm an ableist person? No, but it's still people talk about it. So I just want to be kind to all of our listeners.

329
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:42,000
If you personally are offended by what I'm doing, please send me an email. All right. SSJ100Matt says that's fair, but companies directions change. It seems like Google has spent a lot on stadia. I don't trust Google not to pull the plug. I just see a lot of trends with tech companies doing this and blaming it on the pandemic.

330
00:28:42,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Hmm. Yeah, I mean, I again, I understand, like, I can acknowledge everything Jamie is saying is true. And the reality is, yeah, Google scaled back on column A, but they're expanding in column B. But I can also say, yeah, the skepticism from the tech culture as a whole is still runs rampant because of their track record. I get it. I get it.

331
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Let's see. Tiger Claw says, you probably can side load it. You just need an APK. So all right. Anyway, back on the TikTok thing, though, I think that it's probably just a matter of time before TikTok probably incorporates cloud gaming into it one way or another and really amps the quality of this these games. But until we have, you know, we have a lot of people talking about it.

332
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:41,000
Devices that better bring games to our phones beyond just touch. I'm not sure that's going to be a reality. But then I guess Sony's got something in the works.

333
00:29:41,000 --> 00:30:10,760
Just don't see the value in adding games. I get it. Like, it keeps people on the platform. But like, they're not really having trouble keeping people on the platform. I mean, that it's well known that if like, people are very much engaged with the content on TikTok, they'll spend hours there, my wife. So I know that it's just, I don't see the value add for adding games to it. Like, like, I can't see any users go, man, I really do, you know, check out TikTok. If it had games on it, I just don't see that.

334
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:40,400
And unless they're doing something notable with it, like saying, look, now you can make content involving these games as well. You know, that way, maybe that might appeal to a crowd of people that want to watch people play mobile games, I don't know. But like something to that effect, like, I just can't see the value add of adding games because literally everybody is adding games to their platforms. Facebook's added games, you know, Netflix is looking at games and stuff like nobody has more interest in those platforms.

335
00:30:40,400 --> 00:31:05,560
Other games are being added. Like, I just think, read the room, TikTok. I don't know. I just want to see them do something, you know, notable with it, like actually involve the games in the content creation for your platform, that would be something unique, that would be a selling point for your platform. But if you're just like, well, add games now. Just another platform people have to develop for.

336
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:30,840
step it up with where they're at now this year. So this is interesting. All right. Anyway, I'm sure more to come on this. And we'll talk about it in future weeks. But let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of things that we've been playing this week. And Dark Sakura, I guess this probably is is your gaming week. But I know you got to play a lot of classic games at a pretty big convention here on the West Coast this weekend, right?

337
00:32:31,240 --> 00:33:00,000
Yep. So I went to California extreme. And I have a sinus infection. I'm going to be perfectly honest. I, I wasn't 100%. And by the time it was done, I was even I was like at minus 20%. But I had a great time. And I got to see friends, I ran into Mel and Melody, and they're delightful little girl. And I saw Amanda.

338
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:28,720
And lots of friends. And but anyway, I was going to go through some of the games that I played because they had some interesting games. There are a lot of staples. But I had played a tiny Miss Pac Man. And I played Well, I was gonna play it and then I didn't. They had a beat mania 2d x beast over. Oh, didn't play it because

339
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:53,480
people were like, trying to jump in front of me. They had a dance rush. Oh, wow. Yeah, I actually watched someone play it who was pretty good and did some some fun freestyle on it. Zen monkey No, that's that's not happening. I don't know where you're getting any of that information from to talk is not going to be the next periscope. It's already proven that it's not.

340
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Um, they had hold on, I'm trying to find the I took a picture of all the games that I played so that I would remember all the games that I would played. They had a Commodore 64 that I showed you.

341
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Yeah, so in addition to having just like, you know, the old arcade cabinets and the pinball machines and new, I guess it's really not just old arcades. It's it's really a history because you know, the 2d x the dance rush. Those are new games. So there's that but they it's also kind of a little bit of a trade show where people have like classic games or I should say trade should be like swap meet or whatever you want to call it. Like a bunch of vendors will bring, you know, classic stuff to these shows. And I know Yeah, you texted me about the Commodore 64 you saw and I was like, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

342
00:34:37,480 --> 00:35:07,480
I can't really spend money on stuff like that right now. But I thought it was cool. Like it's it's nice to see like, wow, that Pac Man disc still works. That's cool because I thought those things lost their magnetite magnetization after time.

343
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:37,480
Famicom. But they, there was cracking DJ, which I always suck at, of course, I played Mania three, the final. They had a game called dazzler, which I played just for the lulls. It's bad. Space Fury, which was one of my mother's favorite games in our clique of vision. I am not great at it. They had a return to Oz poster that I almost bought.

344
00:35:37,480 --> 00:36:07,480
I don't know if it shows up, but they also somebody was also selling a board game called keeping it sexy. And it was Kenny G on the cover. I played Bosconian, which fun little game played in a while. I played Super Street Fighter two and got my ass handed to me. I played journey and got my ass handed to me. I played Strider and got my ass handed. I'm kidding. I actually did okay at Strider.

345
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:37,480
I played a tabletop Pac Man and did okay. And then I had booze. And then now this was cool. I don't know if anyone can see this on the camera, but they had a Famicom hooked up a Navy Famicom and had goonies in it. Not goonies, but goonies. Oh, wow. Yep. Another person was selling the the baseball team lions in Japan.

346
00:36:37,480 --> 00:37:07,480
Edition Game Boy. I knew a friend who had the game cube that they put out for the hanching tigers. So those are those end up being pretty rare. They're like only sold in this one like baseball store, you know. And I'm trying to find I also met the person who has like the world's high score in a

347
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:37,480
puzzle wobble and puzzle wobble. Okay. I played the new Toy Story for pinball. Oh, yeah. I didn't even know there was one of those until I saw your husband posted a picture on Facebook. Yeah. Um, I got some pictures of that. I'll throw them up. I beat Vampire Savior. Funny enough, like I've only played like Queen Bee a couple of times. So just it was like a terrible monitor tube. I decided to play and I beat Vampire Savior. Yay.

348
00:37:37,480 --> 00:38:07,480
Um, they had a prototype for Far Cry five paradise lost like a machine gunner game. Huh? And hold on, I'm actually trying to get to where Far Cry five. That sounds awesome. Oh, it let's see paradise loss. Maybe like a spark cry paradise. Far Cry five persimmon. There's a five behind it. It probably looks like a game released around the same time or something. Yeah, weird. Because yeah, that's

349
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:37,480
artwork for like the original Far Cry game. I thought it might have been actually that's not five. I think that was four. Whereas in the mountains and they had a guy that had like a it's just Far Cry instincts paradise lost. Okay, Far Cry instincts. Yeah, that's, that's, that's a spin off of the original game. So it was it was fun and you got points for headshots and you could blow shit up, which I liked. I love the original part doesn't love to blow shit up. Um, I

350
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:46,360
played a DJ max technica three. Um, okay, so gosh, this is gonna look absolutely terrible.

351
00:38:48,040 --> 00:39:06,920
Yeah, which again, for our podcast, but she's showing video of somebody actually playing that dance rush game. And it just looks like fireworks exploding under somebody's feet. I as it should be. I played for never looked like that play my game. Um, I played,

352
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,360
computer space ball, which is a version of pong. It's a

353
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,880
SSG 100. Matt is asking about fun pins. We mentioned Toy Story four.

354
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,000
There's more I'm getting there.

355
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:37,160
Um, I played our type. I love our type bad at it. I played crazy auto. You know, crazy auto was it was a prototype room as Pac Man and they recreated it. Yeah, yeah. Um, I played a little

356
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:56,160
melody play tapper. I played timber. I played carnival. I saw a group called the tonberries. I played a Rob Zombie spook show for pinball. I know you had a pinball machine. Yeah, it's, it's, it's pretty neat one. I played

357
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:16,360
um, uh, tinkle Maury shooting, which is kind of, I guess, like the kind of like a point blankish kind of game. Um, I found a Neil, I bought some games, but I grabbed highlight instead of Final Fantasy two. But I have Final Fantasy three, I have

358
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:33,640
um, uh, Hattori Hanzo, I have transformers, mystery of convoy, and I got, uh, space panic for Coleco vision. And, um, I also bought the, uh, the, uh, mega ranger box set for super Sentai series.

359
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:44,800
Oh, wow. And I didn't pay a whole lot for it. I'm happy. I also got a, um, I think it's like a necklace kind of thing or a hangy thing, but it has a little rabbite on it from, uh, secret of mana.

360
00:40:45,240 --> 00:41:04,280
Um, but now as for, um, the pinballs, cause there were, there were a lot of pinballs there. I pretty much didn't play anything that I own. Um, but I did play some, some rush. The one that I wanted to play and didn't get to, cause I was so busy was Godzilla.

361
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:27,080
Um, but, uh, I played some Deadpool played, uh, I, I know the other one I wanted to play was big bang bar. Cause you know, I love big bang bar. Um, and it was either down or in use. Um, I played bride of pin bot. They did not have a bride of pin bot 2.0. You know which one that is, right?

362
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,760
Yeah, it's the one you used to have, right?

363
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:46,240
Uh, we, we borrowed one. We didn't have, we, we owned, I don't know which tables are yours and which ones are, right. But you know, bride of pin bot, you know, with the eyes and everything. And it had the, just the, you know, standard, uh, clock type scoreboard.

364
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:56,400
Someone went in and did a mod for it that uses a color DMD and, uh, now, uh, the newer style, uh, rule sets.

365
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah. I remember. Yeah. I remember that machine you had in your house at one point. Yeah.

366
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:16,400
Yeah. But that it had like extra modes and everything and all kinds of neat music. It really brought bride of pin bot to the modern pinball age. Um, but, uh, they also had a legit cactus Canyon cause they finally, uh, finished and got those just distributed.

367
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:39,680
Um, but there were also like some other prototype games around, um, some fan games. Of course I have like a killer bee. Um, they had a cyber ball and I was like, so tempted to try to find someone to play it with me. Cause that also is like college vibes. Cause it was right next, it was on the same wall as my world cup soccer.

368
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:52,240
Um, there, there were, there was also like a middle slug five. There were the, um, there was, they didn't bring like the full scale Japanese, uh, candy cabs.

369
00:42:52,520 --> 00:43:04,680
Um, like they had a few years ago, but they did have, um, like a couple of bullet hell games and they had, uh, um, like, uh, the Sega Tetris.

370
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:20,680
And the gigantic one, no, no, no, that that's, that's like the ticket spitter Tetris. They had like the Sega Tetris. Um, the, the ones that they do for tournament play now, um, they had like a sit down star Wars.

371
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:32,680
They had the star Trek, uh, simulator game. They had, um, I called it like my Coleco vision corner. Cause they had space fury and mousetrap and Gorf.

372
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:44,680
And a carnival, which is all stuff I enjoyed playing on a Coleco vision. Um, and they had that ambulance game, but right when I went to go play it, some guy just walked over and put his kid on it.

373
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,680
And I'm like, he's like, Oh, are you going to play this? You could play this game. It's like, no, I wanted to play this one.

374
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:59,680
And I had more choice things to say, but I didn't say them because there are certain things that children are too young to hear.

375
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:07,680
Um, Coleco's got, didn't we just hit like the 40th or 40, 40th anniversary Coleco? I think we did.

376
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:24,680
Um, but, um, I don't know. I, uh, I had such, such a, a pretty good time. I mean, I got super worn out. Um, Dan said that they did their Epic Warlords game.

377
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:52,680
Um, and I, I had my customary Amaretto sour and wandered around and talked to people, just random people and got very overstimulated and then went to go sit down and I kind of wish that I had other games on my phone that I felt like playing, but I was kind of gamed out a few moments, you know, here and there.

378
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:05,680
But I, I talked to some people, made some friends. Um, it was a lot of fun. It was, Oh, there was, uh, last year that we had it at somewhere else and it was a much smaller this year.

379
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:12,680
They were back to the same place, had the full ballroom. Dan went to a panel with the, the, the creator of Qbert.

380
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:23,680
That's cool. I didn't go to that one. I didn't know. Cause he didn't tell me until after he was done. Um, but they had the, the, uh, pinball tournament room. So they did the pinball tournament.

381
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:35,680
They had the console room, you know, with people playing rock band and singing and fun. And I may have been singing edge of glory from the, uh, from the vending area.

382
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:54,680
Nice. Um, cause the person that was singing it, she did okay. She just was a little off key. Um, and then there was this kid that gets up and starts, uh, like, I don't know, but he did like the death metal version of, um, Oh God.

383
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:09,680
Now what it was a David Lee Roth era, um, uh, Van Halen song. And now I can't remember what it was and it's not hot for teacher. Uh, no, it wasn't, it wasn't David Lee Roth. It was a Van Hagar era. He did a run around.

384
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,680
Okay.

385
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:20,680
But he did it like in this death metal voice. It was actually kind of metal though. Um, but yeah, I mean, it was just like, there's the fun experiences like that. They had the Tonberries playing.

386
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,680
They had, um, got some other band that I didn't stay for. Cause it was really loud in that small room.

387
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:35,680
It sounds like quite the collection of stuff this year. I'm, I'm sad I missed it, but between COVID and I have plans to go to the Bay area next week for a concert. I didn't really want to do two weeks in a row. So.

388
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,680
But you know, that other side room that they would have with more arcade games in it.

389
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,680
Yeah. It's been a while, but yeah.

390
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,680
It wasn't there. It was closed off.

391
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:59,680
Oh, so we, we had one less room of games, but it was still pretty fun. They had a lot of, um, two player table games. Like they had the joust table and, um, just a few other things.

392
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:11,680
They had a bunch of, uh, the, the tables laid out in the hallway too, just, you know, I guess some overflow and, oh, for a moment I thought Dan was sending me a correction note.

393
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,680
We now have an insulated garage.

394
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,680
Nice. I wish I had one of those.

395
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:24,680
Our game room is almost there. We're having our air conditioner for it installed on the 16th.

396
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,680
Oh, that's awesome.

397
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,680
So we're having the gaming garage and I'm tangenting, but this is important.

398
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,680
No, it's, it's the future of gaming at your house.

399
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:40,680
We have Dan put carpet tiles down that are gray and black in the shape of one of the space invader aliens.

400
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:50,680
Yeah. You mentioned that last week, but yeah, that's cool. Um, how was the attendance this year? I mean, cause it was kind of back to normal or back to pre pandemic, I guess, whatever you want to call it.

401
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:57,680
It was, it was busy and there were, there were a decent number of people masked and they were highly encouraging it.

402
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Um, and the employees or the volunteers were masked, but there were a lot of people who were not.

403
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,680
Yeah.

404
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:15,680
Um, and I had some intervals, but just because, I mean, I do have asthma where I had to take my mask off just to, to catch my breath a little bit.

405
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,680
Um, I tried to do that more in open areas, you know, where it wasn't so thick and full of people.

406
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:30,680
But, um, I don't know if it's fatigue just from having been up all day. Cause you know, I do have that condition.

407
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:40,680
Um, but I'm feeling white today and had a sore throat. I did have a sore throat last night too, but I also have a sinus infection.

408
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:55,680
Well, if I'm going to test, take a test in the morning, it's the only way I know for sure. Nope, five days, three days from initial five days, five days, according to CDC, three days, according to CDC, but that's all right.

409
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,680
I just looked it up today.

410
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:07,680
Okay. Sorry. All right. Your, your health. All right. Um, let's say, and I just speaking from personal experience, it only took three days, but that's all right. What do I know? All right.

411
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:13,680
Uh, let's move on with our gaming weeks to talk about, uh, low, uh, low key. We'll go to you. How was your gaming week?

412
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:41,680
Uh, it's Minecraft. Yeah. I've been, uh, working on designing a, um, it's a robot repair shop. It's supposed to be like an old gas station converted over to repair robots. So it's got a bunch of like broken stuff out front. And I try to make, um, like kind of, I like a lot of the stuff that I build to have some sort of like, not necessarily effects, but like just like action movement to them.

413
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:59,680
So like stuff moves when you walk past when the robots, you hear it kind of like, um, break down a little bit or like one of the robots that's fallen flat on the ground, like the light in the back of it's flashing and stuff. So like stuff like that, um, try to incorporate in there, but it looks pretty cool so far.

414
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:28,680
So that'll be coming in a video here very soon. I'm just working on, uh, designing the interior for it. Cause it's supposed to be a shop, but yeah, lots of people have been, um, doing stuff on the server and it looks really nice. Very nice. Um, spawn town there. I was looking at my analytics earlier and we're up to 520 subscribers or 519, I think. So it's slowly moving along. Um, yeah. Yep. We'll get there.

415
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:46,680
Eventually years. So yeah, that's what I've been working on. Um, yeah, probably should play some other games. Uh, there's, uh, the, the nest maker bite off three is going on pretty soon here.

416
00:50:46,680 --> 00:51:03,680
I have considered making something for it, but probably not. I don't think I can juggle both at the same time. That was my, um, that was kind of like why I wasn't doing like YouTube stuff like months ago is because of, uh, the nest maker stuff.

417
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:32,680
It's hard to do juggle both of like the limited schedule. So I probably won't do anything for that. I did have somewhat of an idea for something, but like, I don't know. I still want to go through, they put up new courses for the software. That's more, it's way more in depth than what they've done in the past. In the past, they've kind of, uh, gone with the angle of like, okay, you can kind of, you can drag drop stuff to make a game, but this is like, okay, yeah, you could do that. And you'll get something that kind of makes it easier.

418
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:45,680
Like we could kind of call a game, but like, if you really want to make a game, like you would just not even use any of the modules that we created and go like completely from scratch and just completely code the whole thing.

419
00:51:45,680 --> 00:52:12,680
Um, that's the new course that they have now. So it's like a super advanced course, which is, which is good because you can do a lot of things that you can't normally do if you just use their, um, software for like all of the arrangement of everything. There's, you know, animations and stuff. I haven't even updated their software in months, so it probably offers a lot more now anyways. But yeah, I'm very curious to see what that is. And then of course, all the games are come out from that.

420
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:38,680
But yeah, the game I wanted to make or an idea for a game that I had would be based off of Hermitcraft season seven, they did a tango did a thing called decked out. It was a game that they played basically where you, you go into this like maze. It's not really amazing, like a bunch of different rooms, like a dungeon, if you will. And then there's these giant monsters called ravagers that are chasing you down.

421
00:52:39,680 --> 00:53:07,680
And you have a compass that guides you to basically a treasure spot. So you it's randomized each time, and then you go and find the treasure and then you have to get out without dying. And then with that you get cards that provide different abilities. So there's like this noise meter that goes up called clank that as more clank is accumulated, you know, the danger gets greater. And so they have some that will like help you avoid getting that.

422
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:23,680
There's some that adds more treasure and a lot of different things. So that was the idea that was like, okay, cool, I can make a nest version of that. Then, you know, put that out, get like the Hermitcraft crowd interest in the channel, stuff like that, you know, that's way too much work. So I'm just gonna do what I'm doing now.

423
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,680
All right.

424
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,680
Hey, if it ain't, if it ain't fixed, don't break it.

425
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:39,680
It's just it's a lot of work for just something that like, some cat just people will casually look at. No one's not gonna be like, come check out everything. It'd just be like, hey, it's a neat thing.

426
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,680
You should do a behind the scenes video.

427
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,680
Of what?

428
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,680
Of what you do.

429
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,680
Sure. I could.

430
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:54,680
I mean, I think the behind the scenes stuff for for, you know, especially might inspire other content creators.

431
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:23,680
Yeah, there's a few groups that I've been like joining their discords for. So like, I just joined a discord for another group of content creators on a server called Nomadcraft. So they've started their third season, there's some of them I've followed from like other things that they've done. So I've been like giving advice in there because a lot of them, there's a few members that are just starting out. So they're all making the same mistakes I did before where like really horrible audio and stuff like like, you know, like where where they're talking very quietly and they

432
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:43,680
all of a sudden blasting the music and let's say okay, I can't listen. I can't watch your videos. They're unwatchable like that when your volume is just all over the place. So like I've been trying to offer advice like here's what you do to normalize all this because like, yeah, I wasn't that bad. But like I had some issues with audio because it wasn't the perfect, you know, environment to record in and

433
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,680
Just look at your waveform and see where the spikes are. Adjust the spikes.

434
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:59,680
Yeah, I get a lot of them. They're just getting started. Like, you know, they have less than 20 subscribers and stuff like that. So it's fine. I get it. You'll make mistakes. You'll learn from mistakes. You get better. So

435
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:22,680
I'll get into my gaming week, which was a lot of similar things. I played more Final Fantasy XIV, more Dead by Daylight, a little bit more No Man's Sky, finally started that expedition. You might remember last week we talked about a patch and I was like, it's kind of weird that they haven't started the new expedition yet, but they did. They did roll it out this week. Something that was interesting about the new expedition. It's the first time that you don't start on a planet and it has the normal intro sequence. So they actually have a little bit more of a

436
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:43,680
They changed the intro to a female narration voiceover, which is cool. And it was like a different voice and you start on a freighter as opposed to on a planet. And the theme of the expedition is definitely about freighters. And for what it's worth, if Bobby's out there listening, I have yet to have to fight pirates. And I'm on page two out of what?

437
00:55:43,680 --> 00:56:07,680
Five pages. And I did not see fighting as any of the things. It's all about freighter building and exploring with your freighter and doing things related to that. So that's kind of cool. So I did get to explore some of the things they actually patched in about. Yeah, they really just made your freighter, like just took it one step further so that you could build out like a full base on your freighter, which is really cool.

438
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:31,680
But now they have tailored rooms and tailored environments, and that you can like build out onto like observation decks. And that's the cool part because you could actually have more windows and like if you park your freighter in front of a planet, you'll see that planet in the background. It's just it's just really cool. So it's cute that they took it a step further. I don't think it's a major content patch. But it's I mean, still, it's like, wow, there's still a lot of content.

439
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:52,680
it's cute that they took it a step further. I don't think it's a major content patch. But it's I mean, still, it's like, wow, they're still patching at all that game all this time out. So I'll continue playing that expedition. I haven't been streaming it. Just because my energy in general has been low ever since the COVID thing. It's just a little bit slower of recovery. But I'll get back there and do some do some more streaming soon.

440
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,680
I almost forgot. Yeah, I did play Dead by Daylight Final Fantasy.

441
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,680
Of course you did. Of course you did. All right. I would be shocked if you did.

442
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,680
Well, I had to say because I didn't sing with the week and you reminded me. Thank you. Bye bye.

443
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:28,680
I also played, you know, I play my GPS games, Ingress, Pikmin, and Pokemon Go had an event today for shiny Hoosian Volibies was the thing today. And I did what like something like 15 raids and caught one shiny. But it got me motivated to walk around downtown.

444
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:39,680
And the other thing that they've added. Oh, what did I call it? Braviary. Oh, sorry. Volibie is the base. Sorry. I was close. Same family.

445
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:47,680
No, actually, no, it's not even the same family. Volibie is the other one. Whatever. Rufflet. Baby Rufflet turns into Braviary.

446
00:57:47,680 --> 00:58:06,680
But I was gonna say the thing that Pokemon Go did recently that I thought was kind of cool was they added this new incense that's like your daily incense that you use and it lasts for 15 it's a blue incense that lasts for 15 minutes.

447
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:23,680
And you try to catch basically as many Pokemon as you can in 15 minutes, but you have to keep moving in order for it to spawn more Pokemon. But the interesting thing about it, it works the exact same in rural areas versus cities.

448
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:44,680
So it's finally a feature that they've added in, you know, as a bit of a response to the role players that say there's nothing for us to kind of, you know, help motivate and, and it, you know, it has all the social media sharing of, hey, look, I caught 26 Pokemon on my walk today and that whole thing where you can actually see a picture of everything you caught.

449
00:58:45,680 --> 00:59:08,680
So you can see just how many fucking the same things I always get. Apparently, the generation one birds reskinned in Pokemon Legends that were kind of redone are like a reward that you can actually get for that. They're very low catch rate and they run very easy, but I thought it was kind of neat that they built that into it.

450
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:37,680
So I think daily incense is probably one of the better features they put in Pokemon Go for quite some time. And I'm also kind of surprised they should have had the trigger ready to go on this before they reverse the other incense changes. And it probably would have stung a lot less. But who knows, maybe this is because of that. Oh, I didn't realize there were Galarian versions. I thought they would I thought they went into thanks, Steph. Sorry, clearly, I don't know my Pokemon well enough. So they're the Galarian versions. I thought they were from Legends.

451
00:59:38,680 --> 01:00:07,680
So interesting. Okay. Well, still, it's it's, you know, a rarer version of those birds than have been in the game before. So it's kind of neat. They tied it to that feature. But yeah. Yeah. And Mike Deaf says the daily incense doesn't require you to move. If not, it doesn't work at all. And plus you you can't fast catch. And if you catch with the Pokemon Go Plus, I don't think they go into your log. I don't know if it works or not. Plus, I wouldn't want to try to catch a legendary bird with the Pogo Plus.

452
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:36,680
So like you have to actually play the game. That's the part that sucks is you can't fast catch. I don't like that. But really, Mike Deaf says you can fast catch? No, because they they'll they won't go away. I guess that you can fast catch but then they don't they stay on the map. But if you tap it again, no matter what you do, it'll run away. So it's it's weird. So anyway, really, Deaf says he does fast. I swear when I did it the first day, it doesn't work. But I'll try it again. I'll screen record this time.

453
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:51,680
So all right. But that otherwise that was pretty much it for make it clearly I don't know what I'm talking about with Pokemon Go today. But I don't know the games. The game's still more interesting to me right now that it's been in a while. So there's that.

454
01:00:51,680 --> 01:01:20,600
There's that. All right, we're gonna get into some gaming news. First off, though, before we get into gaming news, something I just wanted to bring up, I'm sure everybody heard this news today. But I have to acknowledge and tip the hat and express the sadness I felt when I heard Nichelle Nichols passed away today. You know, I know she was not in the greatest health. But still, you know, what a legend. And you might be thinking, what does this have to do with video games?

455
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:49,440
And I argue Nichelle Nichols broke barriers in television, in sci fi, in everything. And yes, that includes games. She broke down barriers for people of color. She broke down barriers for women. And I think in just, you know, I never had the pleasure of meeting her. But I've always heard nothing but glowing things about just what a nice, truly wonderful person she is. And you can't say that about everybody that was on the original series.

456
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:54,760
But I digress. Yeah, I mean, 89 is a great run. It's still it's still sad, you know, you know,

457
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:10,320
Tiara, and I were saying earlier that we need a protective bubble around George Takei and Walter Cohen. And then then then we're like, why is Shatner still around? And I think that he's using blood transfusions from Keith Richards.

458
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:20,840
That was I mean, I know it's, you know, I'm just gonna say it. That was my first reaction is why couldn't have been Shatner. All right. But maybe I shouldn't speak that. It's probably not a nice thing to say.

459
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,240
Oh, no, no. Shatner is a terrible person.

460
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:23,740
Oh, I know.

461
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,840
Yeah. Especially the things he says about autistic people.

462
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:57,280
It's just I didn't I tell the story about the Star Trek. Maybe I didn't say it was about Shatner. It was about Shatner. All right. Let's see. But anyway, I don't want to bring up negativity around her passing because it's it's an incredibly sad event. And yes, she was not in the best health, but it doesn't make it any less sad, especially knowing what a trail that she blazed for everyone. But especially women and people of color.

463
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:15,200
That pod culture says awesome lady got to meet her a couple of times. As Joe and Hunter Matt points out, Bill Russell passed away today, too, from the sports world. Both badasses that broke barriers and pioneers. And then I'm so sorry, I forget her name in the moment. Pat Carroll, the voice.

464
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,400
Yeah, she did.

465
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,680
Yeah, she was in her 90s. But but still, you know, again, doesn't make it any less sad.

466
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:28,680
It's classic voice. What a what a horrible day. A little mermaid. Yeah, a lot of people. Well, you know, it happens in threes.

467
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:40,160
Yeah, what a horrible day. What a horrible day. All right. But anyway, I wanted to make sure we acknowledge that because it's important. So let's get into some gaming news from there. Loki.

468
01:03:41,160 --> 01:04:09,920
Right. So steam is clamping down on some of these. I guess the artwork for different games. You may see a lot of these kind of it reminds me of the box art in some of the retail games that are out there. Batman gave me the year edition. Where you have all of your alco accolades, you know, being put up on there, or like, sometimes they'll put like, you know,

469
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:39,800
it's on sale right now, you know, more things to try to catch your eye as you're browsing the store. Well, seems not having any of that they wanted to be straightforward. So they're basically saying that no more, we're not allowing a word logos, review scores, you know, basically, they have a set of guidelines now that they're not allowing any of that stuff. So no review scores of any kind, no word names, no discount marketing copy, no text or imagery

470
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:44,200
promoting a different product, and no other miscellaneous text.

471
01:04:45,200 --> 01:05:07,720
I mean, I understand that promoting a different product and the miscellaneous text and some of that silly stuff. But I'm, I'm a little sorry. I mean, imagine if they did that to movie posters, you couldn't put a word logos or clips from reviews or review scores, like think of how many movie posters you've seen that are filled with that stuff. So I'm a little surprised. They're throwing that out in steam as well.

472
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:32,440
That's because I think this is more of like, it's more of like, I don't know, I'm trying to think of like, if even if like, Netflix and stuff has all that stuff in there, like titles, but like, it's just supposed to be cleaner to look at is what they're trying to get at. If you want to put all your worst stores full of garbage, we all know that there's so much garbage on the steam store. And I understand they have to do something about it.

473
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:44,920
Yeah, so if they keep that pretty much clean, you can put all your word text and everything like that in the body of your actual store page. But with the actual logo itself, they don't want any of that.

474
01:05:44,920 --> 01:06:09,600
E3VL in chat says some of the quotes are out of context anyway. Oh, absolutely. But again, movies do the same thing. And you also have critics that will intentionally say things to get on movie posters to bump up their own cred. I mean, it's, I don't don't trust that stuff on movie posters. Maybe awards depending on what you're into might sway your decision a little bit. I would never trust pull quotes.

475
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:38,940
I do like the page that they they show off examples of that because once again, this goes back to like, I think I saw Twitter posting from the artists before those making these fake game. I guess not screenshots, but like, game art for these stuff. So you have guitar billionaire, it's probably fine. Custard, or was it custard castle small claims court? You know, it's just fun little

476
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,300
mock artworks that they put on there.

477
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:59,420
I mean, if I were to say something like, let's say like Yaris, and I say, Oh, man, Yaris is the game of the year for me to poop on. You know, they can, they can pull the quote, I called it game of the year, dot dot dot. So it's just the pull quotes always are a little

478
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:07,020
if there was one game that came out in the year that yours came out, it would be the game of the year. But since there are other things,

479
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:16,780
any other game is a better game than Yaris is a better game. I don't know what they call it better game better gaming. Anyway,

480
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:46,300
you know, we we talk so much crap about Yaris. And there's real developers behind that game to develop that. I know. I mean, it was a paycheck. You know, it's a paycheck. Yeah, I'm not it's a paycheck. I don't want anything against them. But I do hold something against, you know, the Yaris at least they didn't charge for it. That's true. That's true. At least they didn't charge for it. All right. Well, for things that might be a little more pleasant to drive. Let's talk about Mario Kart. And yes, still content

481
01:07:46,300 --> 01:08:16,220
coming in for Mario Kart and some Mario Kart DLC that's coming. August 4th wave two was announced and I gotta say some of these some of these courses sound great. So wave two will be including the turnip cup and the propeller cup. The turnip cup has tour New York minute from Mario Kart tour SNES Mario circuit three classic course. calamari desert from N64. That's a classic course and one of my very favorite courses in all of Mario

482
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:45,420
Kart DS Waluigi pinball is coming out for that's that's worth it right there in my opinion. The propeller cup has the Sydney sprint from tour snow land from GBA the mushroom gorge from the Wii. I think that was a pretty cool one. And some folks were saying, you know, is this mean they're all going to be recycled courses? And it turns out the answers? No, I think there was one new course in the first set. And now we're going to get a new course called sky high Sunday.

483
01:08:46,060 --> 01:09:15,100
And it's a little of course ice cream parlor themed new course that's in the mix as well. So I mean, great. I mean, how long has this game been out like eight years and it's still getting new content. So you can check that out. Again, that is coming out on August 4 is when that releases. Now, apparently there have has also been some rumors about future Mario Kart DLC. You know, we love rumors. Apparently, there was a video that

484
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:45,020
came out earlier on Twitter that kind of correctly called the turnip cup and the propeller cup that they just knew because of the the the data that they knew that turnip was going to be a tour Super Nintendo and 64 and DS track propeller was tour GBA we and unspecified the new course, right? So we're going to be getting if the rest of this is accurate, there's going to be the rock cup, the moon cup,

485
01:09:45,220 --> 01:10:14,180
the fruit cup. I love that the fruit cup, the boomerang cup, the feather cup, the cherry cup, the acorn cup and the spiny cup. And across all of those there are yogurt cup or the activity a cup. There are six question marks, which indicates six new courses potentially coming. For you classic folks, though only one SNES course in the cherry cup apparently but tour is the big one

486
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:44,020
every single cup has a tour at least one tour track in it. So definitely it sounds like if nothing else Mario Kart tour kind of donated tracks to Mario Kart eight, but I don't think that's too surprising. You know, considering that Mario Kart tour didn't quite end up having that same reception at the end of the day, but they're sure sure getting the most out of that content, aren't they? So as Joe and her Matt suggests the pinkberry cup Oh, remember the days we were obsessed the pinkberry they're still around, but it is

487
01:10:44,180 --> 01:11:13,900
well, number one, I can't have all that sugar anymore. It kind of ruins it for me, doesn't it? But sugar, they do know where they have a pinkberry. They have one over at the the Roseville Galleria. Oh, yeah, right in the middle. Yeah. Yeah, right. Right in time for round one to finally open. When's that place ever gonna open? On the sixth apparently? Really? Where did you hear that? It was actually posted on their site. I think I saw it in the

488
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:23,660
the arcade. I forget what they call it now. The previously called Sean against arcade thing. In Sacramento game thing, but

489
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:43,980
this entire show to look this up. Where Okay, it still says coming soon on the website. Would it back down players? Yeah, it's on the Westfield Galleria at Roseville website. Says round one entertainment opening Saturday, August 6. 10am to 11pm.

490
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:50,060
Interesting. Hold on. I gotta find this. I gotta find this. Yeah, so it's Westfield Galleria website.

491
01:11:52,300 --> 01:12:13,860
I'm looking at it. I don't see it. Oh, there. Oh, there it is. Oh my god. You're right. 10am to 11pm. How about that? Hold on. Hold on. Yes, I I will shut this whole show down with local news. Absolutely. Because this is important. This is important. But there it is right there. Look at that on the right side. Opening Saturday, August 6. Oh, I have to text Shane. He's gonna be so excited

492
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:43,300
because he's gonna be here. Like right after that for a wedding. And so he'll be able to go how funny. That's great. Yeah, so I'll have to go check it out. Yeah, I want to go as well. So that's great. All right. Um, let's move on. We have more news. And I need to step away for just a moment. So Dark Sakura, what do you have for us in the news? Oh, some stuff. Um, so analog, you know, the company that does a lot of the

493
01:12:44,340 --> 01:13:13,580
new hardware for old material. Of course, they have the analog pocket, which is a really cool handheld device that resembles a Game Boy in how it's set up. They have announced a, a port of a game that came out in 1962. The original space war. It was done in 1962 by a bunch of engineers led by Steve

494
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:43,180
Russell at MIT. They used a PDP-1 mini computer and a 1024 by 1024 pixel CRT display. And they had a game with two spacecraft, fighting it out in the gravitational will of a star. And they had different controllers for it. And they could now I remember being on record saying this actually not the oldest video game that there was that one played on a radar back in the 40s.

495
01:13:43,660 --> 01:14:10,060
But this one was legit, you know, a two player game. And now they have it where it will play on the analog pocket. And what's pretty cool about it is that a third party developer called Spaceman 3 had the source code from the PDP-1 computer and space war, since they're both public domain.

496
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:30,060
So they had that with the open FPGA software and they had it set to emulate and it had some very interesting things about it. So since a 1024 by 1024 vector display would generate the image a slightly different way. They had to make some changes to accommodate it.

497
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:59,660
So it is a little bit cleaner, a little bit crisper. There's no AI, of course, because I mean, this was all, you know, a game. But it's been released with their software update. And the software update also adds save states and a few other things. So there you go.

498
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:03,660
All right, well, I think you have a somewhat related story, Loki, right?

499
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:25,180
Yep. So along with the updates to the analog pocket, because they did put out that wonderful open FPGA program, there's been some folks using the repository to create emulators.

500
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:53,180
So there's a couple of repositories opened by a spiritualized 1997, who, very quick after the release, had a repository for F open FPGA, GBA and then open FPGA, Game Boy and Game Boy Color. So allows you to basically download these and then run ROMs off of the analog pocket.

501
01:15:53,180 --> 01:16:10,460
And so there's a small process that involves, I think, it allows you to jailbreak the device. And then you can run ROMs because right now the analog pockets meant specifically for actual hardware, running the actual cartridges themselves.

502
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:38,460
I'm assuming that they're going to open this up for other ROMs eventually, or someone will develop that because at some point they were supposed to have, you know, compatibility with like the Turbo Pocket, and Atari Lynx, and maybe, I don't know if there's like any Genesis or anything like that. Game Gear, that type of stuff. But I don't know, maybe maybe those are coming.

503
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:58,460
Oh, and actually speaking of Game Gear, it looks like they've already started working on that as well. They even have an archive of all the different title screen images for I guess, I imagine it's for the game browser for that. So interesting, the waste is no time.

504
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:06,460
Hackers gonna hack. Jailbreakers gonna jailbreak. Yep, toaster installers gonna install.

505
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:22,460
Sjoener Matt is asking, is it still really hard or take forever to ship the analog pocket? I think they do still have a pretty limited stock, don't they? They're not getting as fast as the Steam decks, apparently.

506
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:28,460
Sure, I don't know how readily available those are.

507
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:57,460
All right. Well, let's talk about another classic. And this is an MMO classic. It's World of Warcraft, you know, back when everybody was actually still playing it. Sorry to those that are still playing it. But let's be real. The game probably peaked around the Wrath of the Lich King expansion. And if you want to revisit the game, as it was during the Wrath of the Lich King, when both myself and DarkSakura were actively playing, you can do that with World of Warcraft classic on September 22.

508
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:25,460
26. So I'm sure many of you know that World of Warcraft a few years ago launched the classic version of World of Warcraft. And since then, they've launched a kind of parallel, some servers that are dedicated to the Burning Crusade expansion, which was the first expansion. Well, now they're going to be doing it again with the second expansion for the game. And that is World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King expansion that was announced this week, and it will be coming out September 26.

509
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:53,460
So yeah, to celebrate the expansion coming, there's a new leveling mechanic in the game called Joyous Journeys. So if you're playing Burning Crusade classic, you can toggle a 50% experience boost. That's a lot. But it is something you toggle at the innkeeper, I'm assuming to preserve the status of the game for those that don't want that or they don't want the help because you know, they're in it for the classic experience.

510
01:18:53,460 --> 01:19:04,460
So, but if you want, you can opt into the Joyous Journeys boost to level up your character to get ready for Wrath of the Lich King classic. If you weren't already aware-

511
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:05,460
Some people like hard mode.

512
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:06,460
What's that?

513
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,460
Some people like hard mode.

514
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:30,460
Oh, for sure, for sure. And I believe even though they launched Burning Crusade, they kept vanilla WoW servers available and you could copy to like one that was going to stay there. So I'm pretty sure with Lich King, they're going to do the same thing. And you can choose to have a character frozen in time in either vanilla WoW, Burning Crusade WoW or Wrath of the Lich King WoW, which is kind of neat.

515
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:38,460
I was just going to ask like, are they just going to eventually update everybody into the modern ones? Like, ah, now the classic servers are the modern servers.

516
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:59,460
I don't think so. And I'm going to be honest, I think this is the last one. I really do. Because honestly, I'm going to keep it real. This is where the game peaked for most people. For me anyway, I could I could say that because the what was next cataclysm? See, the problem with cataclysm is that it went back and redid

517
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:29,340
did vanilla WoW. And that was the start of people wanting to do it. Yeah, but you know, that was the start of people, you know, wanting the the older experience. I don't know, I guess maybe they could do cataclysm. But then when you get to Pandaria, I'm sorry, that's when the game really started to nose dive. So I just I don't see them going all the way to Pandaria. But who knows? Who knows? You know, even if it's one server, maybe they'll do it. Who knows? You know, one server for each expansion. I bet they could fill an audience with that.

518
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:53,460
If you didn't already know, this is included with a World of Warcraft subscription. So, Loki, to your point, you have to pay for modern WoW anyway, to get access to this. So you might as well, right? Yeah. All right. Let's move on. I like this next story Dark Sakura, because this is like one of those sciencey, the science side of gaming.

519
01:20:53,460 --> 01:21:22,460
Um, so there, and you know, I always love to see the like the scientific and psychological research that goes in behind gaming's, gaming's gamers is what I meant. So there has been shown, as published in neuro image reports by Georgia State University researchers, that there are superior sensor motor decision making skills

520
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:43,460
and enhanced activity in key regions of the brain in frequent video game players as compared to non gamers. They used fMRI, which is functional magnetic resonance, resonance imaging to show how that of different parts of the brain are stimulated.

521
01:21:43,460 --> 01:22:05,460
So what they did, I mean, so basically, they were saying that video games played by the overwhelming majority of young people, they said young people, every three, for more than three hours every week shows that decision making abilities are improved, but they don't know how.

522
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:20,460
So with the with their work, they're showing that it's, it's basically brain training. They also call it a therapeutic intervention. So it's stress relief.

523
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:29,460
But it was run, the lead author on the paper is Tim Jordan, who has a PhD in physics and astronomy.

524
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:44,460
He, in his history, he was talking about having weak vision in one eye as a child. And in a study, he said when he was about five years old, he was asked to cover his good eye and play a video game as a way to strengthen the vision in the weak one.

525
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:54,460
And he basically went from legally blind in one eye to being very strong in that eye. And he could go on and play lacrosse and paintball.

526
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:58,460
Now he's a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA.

527
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:09,460
So basically, they had 47 college age participants 28 categorized as regular gamers and 19 as non players.

528
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:30,460
And they had each of them lay in an fMRI machine with a mirror. So they could see a cue with a display of moving dots, and they were asked to press a button on the right or left to indicate which direction dots were moving, or resist pressing a button if there was no directional movement.

529
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:42,460
And then basically, the gamers were faster and more accurate with their responses. And the brain scans showed that there was enhanced activity in certain parts of the brain.

530
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:57,460
So I'll just read the quote here. These results indicate video game playing potentially enhances several of the sub processes for sensation, perception and mapping to action to improve decision making skills.

531
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:09,460
These findings begin to illuminate how video game players playing alters the brain in order to improve task performance, and the potential implications for increasing tasks specific activity.

532
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:20,460
There was no trade off between speed and accuracy of response. They just said that they were better on both of those as opposed to the non knit gamers.

533
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:27,460
So they're basically saying video games are great cognitive trainers.

534
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:44,460
And if anyone wants to, wants a link to the article, the the actual study, it is labeled video game players have improved decision making abilities and enhanced brain activities. And you can see it on Science Direct.

535
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:53,460
Mike Deft in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says just look at Tetris players. Yeah, I mean, you can you'd see you see the brain in motion there.

536
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:58,460
I'm putting the link to the published article in chat for our live listeners.

537
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:02,460
I mean, gamers, we always knew we were smarter than everyone else, right?

538
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:06,460
Just tell us what we already know.

539
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:10,460
It's not a matter of smarts. It's a matter of reactions.

540
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:17,460
No, it is like like there might actually be something to that hand-eye coordination that we always said video games would help with.

541
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:22,460
That much has been proven, but now they're they're showing where the brain is triggered from it.

542
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:30,460
It's it's interesting stuff. It's nice to have the science to back it up. There's still a lot of people out there that won't believe it. But what can you do?

543
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:36,460
I know all of this, you know, wonderful brain development has made me a more effective killer, too.

544
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:43,460
So I mean, in in a video game, in a video game. All right. In Dead by Daylight.

545
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:48,460
All right. Moving on. Loki, you have an update of sorts for us.

546
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:57,460
Yes. Update, if you will. Better, better, better phrases like we're just marking the anniversary of inaction.

547
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:09,460
So Better Ubisoft was a group that was developed trying to get Ubisoft, you know, to do the right thing and address some of these harassment issues.

548
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:21,460
Well, they posted that it has been one year to the day that we've signed our open letter to Ubisoft management calling for far more action to take our tackle abuse and setting out our four key demands.

549
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:35,460
None of these demands have made or been met so far. Their key demands for reference was stop promoting and moving known offenders from studio to studio, team to team with no repercussions.

550
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:44,460
The cycle needs to end. Number two, we want a collective seat at the table to have a meaningful say in how Ubisoft as a company moves forward from here.

551
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:55,460
Three cross industry collaboration to agree on a set of group or ground rules and processes that all studios can use to handle these offenses in the future.

552
01:26:55,460 --> 01:27:05,460
And for this collaboration must heavily involve employees in a non management in non management positions and union representatives.

553
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:18,460
Of course, as we've mentioned, literally anytime we bring up Ubisoft, they have not addressed any of the allegations whatsoever. I think the most that they've done is investigate themselves and found no wrongdoing.

554
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:37,460
So and it's interesting that Activision Blizzard took all the heat in this whole thing, you know, not enough noise is being made about Ubisoft and the fact that things you know, and literally nothing's changed there in a year is really what we're saying, you know, with all these demands, nothing's changed in a year.

555
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:48,460
Well, they got there it was at their Ubisoft forward event that's coming out pretty soon, that I'm sure will be full of people talking about that. Remember last time?

556
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:58,460
I hope the media reports them hand in hand. I hope the media reports it as Ubisoft forward by a company who has not moved forward in the past year happened today.

557
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:16,460
Yeah, more like Ubisoft backwards. But no, they did that last year when they put out the there's like a brief, silent, you know, wall of text where it's like, we take this stuff seriously. And we're this is about the games. We're not going to talk about this right now. We're not gonna get into the politics.

558
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:22,460
The the inaction has shown truly the meaning behind all that white text on a black screen.

559
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:44,460
Mind you that that letter that open letter was signed by 500 employees at the company. So it's not just like one person like I don't think you're doing this right. It's it's a lot of people that think that you're not doing it, as well as the gaming community thinks that you're not doing it right. And then continues to support them by buying their games. But you know, we're unhappy about it.

560
01:28:45,460 --> 01:29:07,460
I showed her Matt says nothing will change until Eves is gone, which isn't happening. Yeah, and that's sad. You know, like, again, the CEOs are not being held accountable, even in the Activision Blizzard thing, even though we see the light at the end of the tunnel with, you know, the Microsoft purchase. And yeah, I do believe things will get better with Microsoft. And I think also, the fact that the unionizations are happening, and they cannot stop it.

561
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:36,460
I think is, you know, also a good thing to happen. It's just amazing to me that Bobby Kotick isn't unemployed. Amazing to me. But we all know, we all know the board is protecting him. They're, they're all protecting each other, all of them. So that's, that's the one good thing about Microsoft coming in is that, you know, even though they can, they have to kind of say for now, well, there'll be there'll be a transitionary Microsoft can get rid of them all, as soon as the deal's done. And I think they will.

562
01:29:37,460 --> 01:30:05,460
I think I don't think there's going to be a place for Bobby Kotick at the new company. So as shown under Matt says, Eves has said that his family would buy up the majority stake of Ubisoft to avoid a corporate takeover, which is just shitty. Then people have to stop buying the games, quite honestly, but it's, I mean, honestly, like from what it seems like the quality of the games has suffered anyway, like Ubisoft has had quite a bit of trouble in the past year. And if you don't think these two things are tied together.

563
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:10,660
I've got a radio tower for you to climb then.

564
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:39,660
Yeah. So just a matter of time before Eves Giamant hopefully is held accountable, but it just might be a long time. Alright, something we'll probably see first is the release of the PlayStation VR 2, of which we got a few more details this week, thanks to a new PlayStation blog entry that showed some of the user experience that will be happening with the PS VR 2. There's going to be a see through camera with the system.

565
01:30:39,660 --> 01:31:03,660
I think we kind of knew that but we got to see it in action, which is nice because you know, you can see where is my dining room table or you know, wherever you're playing at, where's the boundary here? Where am I at in relation to the boundary? Where did I set down the controllers without having to take the whole thing off and all that, you know, and just making sure that you know, like a baby didn't crawl through your play area, the see through camera will be nice for that.

566
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:32,660
So there's actually I guess a card in the control center that lets you do that. But you can't record when you do that, which is interesting. So you can't actually just record what is happening on the see through camera. I guess they don't want any more. What was that? Dammit, the share factory or whatever. What was that called on the early the room? PlayStation room? Whatever that was that people did that. Yeah, adult broadcasts. I don't know.

567
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:57,660
Anyway, um, you can also terrible though, you can also customize the PlayStation VR to area you use the controllers and the cameras to establish a custom play area. So that's kind of interesting. So if you have a couch that shaped funny, or what have you, you can kind of work around that, which I think is kind of interesting. And you can also get warnings when you're getting close to those things. So that's kind of neat.

568
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:27,660
So I don't know if it's like a thing. But I know, like, with a lot of VR, obviously, a lot of it that involves you moving around stuff. I don't know if they have an option with some of these, because like the play space that I have for like those VR things. It's not not very big, especially in the kitchen. But there are some games that I think, like, I would say, like, maybe a no man's sky or something like that, that's less moving, or like you're just moving with a controller and just using the headset for kind of like, you know, like, you know, like, I don't know if it's like a thing, but I know, like, with a lot of VR, obviously, a lot of it that involves you moving around stuff. I don't know if they have an option with some of these, because like the play space that I have for like those VR things. It's not not very big, especially in the kitchen. But there are some games that I think

569
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:57,660
are kind of like a full 360 camera, I guess, if you will. I'm wondering if they have an option, like I can just sit down and do that. It's not gonna like yell at me going your play space is too small. Like because that would be ideal for a lot of games. I would think so. Yeah, because you're right. There's there's games like that would like no man's sky where it's not about moving around and doing all that stuff. Like you're intended to sit on the couch and play and you just are immersed. Tetris effect to be another one that comes to mind. Yeah, you know, you don't move around. And the I think Tetris effect was great.

570
01:32:57,660 --> 01:33:27,660
In VR, but it's it's, it also was certainly a fine game, not in VR either. So it was kind of nice that it was just enhanced by VR. I should point out, though, the other thing that the blog was showing is that you can now film yourself while you're playing, which a lot of people like to do a Beat Saber, it's not going to be that same, like over the shoulder, because the camera that's looking at you is also going to be able to show you on the screen, if you want to capture that sort of stuff. So you can actually capture yourself playing the

571
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:57,660
game. So I thought it was inside out tracking what camera is going to be looking at you? That same one, isn't it? How is it? How's the camera facing out from the headset looking at you? No, there's there's a camera. If you Oh, no, I'm sorry. If you have a PS five HD camera on the console, that it will fill me they sell those. I guess so. I that was news to me too. I didn't know that they had a camera

572
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:27,660
for the console. No, they talked on the blog. Yeah. So no release date for this yet. And we have no idea if it's going to be a this year thing and next year thing or what because Sony still hasn't really point. Yeah, I would think so. But I would say if we get to Labor Day and still don't know, then yeah. I need I need me a new rush of blood game. I'll take I'll take the quarry rush of blood. I mean, I understand that that's not really meant

573
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:57,660
for a roller coaster. But like, why not? I need me a new one of those. So 100 Matt in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says I really hope Sony makes it consumer price friendly. I don't think it will especially since the quest to just got a price increase. And yeah, that also news that is dumb. Yeah. But it is going to be a tough pill to swallow if it's over $300. Yes, the price has to be right. Well, I think also the thing that the PS VR two faces is that still

574
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:27,660
PlayStation fives are not super easy to get. I mean, I know it's easier today than it was before. But it's not super easy. So there's people that they're going to be trying to talk into getting a PlayStation five and one of these I don't know I just this year might just feel a little early for that. But we'll see. It's too bad because like I think a lot of people like you'd be able to get a decent computer that can run VR like Yeah, hell the

575
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:57,660
the laptops we bought for kids like weren't all that expensive, like last year, and those can handle VR. And so I don't understand, like with the price of computers, especially with people replacing stuff now that graphics card prices are coming down in price as well, like you would think that they would be on board with trying to lower the cost of that stuff. But once again, you know, it's like, yeah, that sucks about the meta quest. But there's other things out

576
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:25,740
there that you can get that are just outside of that whole space. And honestly, like, I prefer having those open marketplaces like steam anyways, Facebook has to charge $100 because they can't tie your games to your account anymore and keep stealing your privacy data and sell that to make the money. That's why they have to have the prize. So anyway, let's go to the let's go to a simpler time when we weren't playing VR. Let's get to it.

577
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:49,740
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

578
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:51,820
What did you pick for us this week, DarkSakura?

579
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:52,820
I picked Timber.

580
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:53,820
Timber!

581
01:36:53,820 --> 01:37:18,820
Which is like pretty much a staple of going to California Extreme. So Timber is a game that was manufactured by Bally Midway in 1984. And you have to earn points by chopping down trees and then log rolling and dodging bees by angry bears and stuff. Timber was designed by Steve Meyer, who also did Tapper.

582
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:22,900
And so that's why they have very similar art styles.

583
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,900
Timber Tapper.

584
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:27,900
Timber Tapper.

585
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:43,900
Anyway, the game you play as a lumberjack and it is a two player, so you can do a versus slash co-op kind of play, but you have to chop down a certain number of trees that pop up from the ground within a limited time.

586
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:49,980
You have two joysticks. One joystick is to move around. The other one is actually the motion of your axe.

587
01:37:49,980 --> 01:38:00,980
So as you keep going, your time decreases and your quota increases and then you have to avoid bees, beehives that are thrown by bears.

588
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:13,060
You have to avoid getting hit by the trees as they fall or tripping over stuff and you can sometimes catch these birds that fly out of the trees.

589
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:26,060
And then every few levels you have a way to get bonus points and that's to try to stay standing on a floating log. The log will rotate and you have to use your reflexes to stay on top of it.

590
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:34,140
The first two times you're on that log it's pretty big, but the log starts shrinking.

591
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:41,140
And then the mini game will end if you fall off the log or you stay on top of it for the amount of time and you get all these bonus points.

592
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:46,140
It is multiplayer. Like I said, you can play competitively or cooperatively.

593
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:58,220
So you can earn bonus points by pushing trees onto your other lumberjack and then you get bonus points for whoever cuts down those trees.

594
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:09,220
The cabinet for timber would either be built into a tapper or root beer tapper cabinet since they were also made by Bally Midway.

595
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:19,300
And then in 2004 in Midway's Arcade Adventures 2, the compilation disc for Xbox PlayStation 2 and GameCube was included.

596
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:27,300
Also part of Lego Dimensions accessed by using the arcade dock in the Once Upon a Time Machine in the West.

597
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:44,380
The current world record for this game is by Josh Lumbay with a score of 9,767,550, which was done in 2011 from what it looks like.

598
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:46,380
But yeah, that's your game.

599
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:49,380
I love this game.

600
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:57,380
I don't know if I played it at California Extreme. Probably it's been forever since I've been to California Extreme though.

601
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:06,380
But it was in that, it shows up in those Midway collections. I remember there was one on Xbox that had this in it. Maybe 360 had it too.

602
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:10,380
And I would play the crap out of it. I just think it's a neat game.

603
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:19,380
And there is a strategy to it because, you know, having the stumps and the trees that you can trip on, you have to really think about which way you're chopping trees down.

604
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:27,380
So there's a little bit of strategy to it. Like you can just see in the video that we're watching on Twitch, the guy just fell over the stump there.

605
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:33,380
And that can set you back if you're not careful. So yeah, neat game.

606
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:40,380
Neat game. All right. St100matt in chat says I've only seen and played this machine once, which was a fun spot.

607
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:52,380
So yeah, I haven't seen an actual machine of this in a long, long time, but I'm sure the collector stuff is out there. So all right, Timber, your classic game of the week.

608
01:40:52,380 --> 01:41:01,380
All right, we're going to travel around the industry and check out some other news pretty quick in a segment called Rapid Fire News. We will start with, I think, Loki.

609
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:12,380
Yep. So it's good news if you're looking for a Steam Deck, because Valve has just said that they've, they are fulfilling Steam Deck orders faster than they were expecting.

610
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:30,380
So according to Valve, the company is still able to produce the console, but now instead of the windows being, I think if you ordered now was previously like Q4 or later, they've actually brought that up to Q3.

611
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:46,380
So right now, apparently, the window ranges from July to September, everyone else will fall into Q4, October to December range, if you were in the queue. So basically moving it up three months if you have that on order already.

612
01:41:47,380 --> 01:42:09,380
So that's not bad. And then we talked about this a while ago, but it's finally happened. Roblox has had to remove the oof sound, their iconic sound that had been, I think originally lifted from an old Tommy Tallarico music produced game called Messiah.

613
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:30,380
And you may remember there was this big announcement where Tommy was going to allow folks to actually keep the oof sound in the game for their projects if they paid $1 or $100. That never happened. So something fell through in negotiations.

614
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:33,380
They don't have to raise money for the Amico anymore. So

615
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:57,380
so in the case of what happened here is they just replaced it with a different sound effect now, which I don't understand why they didn't just do that to begin with, because like, how hard is the say oof, kind of similar to what it was before just rerecord your own sound like that literally is a date that that that's like a half a day project right there. And they would have taken care of the whole thing.

616
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:11,380
Well, the good news about this is that maybe we'll never have to hear about that stupid sound again, because I'm over it. I'm so over it. All right. Let's see Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

617
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:32,380
So, there's a leak of the PlayStation plus a central lineup for August. And that is going to include Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2, and Yakuza Like a Dragon and Little Nightmares. In fact, I think it's actually the whole Yakuza series, isn't it supposed to be?

618
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:43,380
Yeah. So and then, yeah, I think that that's going to be fun for people who have PlayStation Plus.

619
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:55,380
Yeah. And also, apparently, there is a preview. Someone got a preview of Yakuza 8. And who knows?

620
01:43:55,380 --> 01:44:07,380
I'm excited for that. Although this is where Bobby would say I still need to finish Like a Dragon, which I'm not saying isn't true. Maybe I do. But you know what? There's a lot of games I have to finish right now. Add it to the list. It's on the list.

621
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:30,380
All right. Get me to stop playing No Man's Sky or Final Fantasy or one of the Forever games, so then I'll have time for it. All right. You want to know a game that is taking a lot of time? Not for me. I kind of I was playing this for a little bit and then I stopped. But Alan is still playing Diablo 3, and he's playing a seasonal character. He got past Paragon 1100.

622
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:59,380
Yes. Yeah. In the season. I'm like, dang, those numbers are but I think I think it's just getting more and more absurd because there's going to come a point when Diablo 3 is no longer going to get content and when Diablo 4 comes out and we know Diablo 4 is coming out soon ish within the next year or for sure. So all right. Let's see. I think I had one too. I want to talk about Oh, yeah, another another passing from earlier this week. This has just not been a great year.

623
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:24,380
Great week in the artistic world. But Kenichi Okuma, a composer for Super Smash Brothers, passed away. That is specifically 2008 Super Smash Brothers Brawl. Kenichi Okuma was one of the many composers and arrangers to the game, composing for games like Gyromite, Pokemon Gym and Evolution from Red and Blue, Flat Zone 2.

624
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:51,380
Those songs did come back in 3DS, Wii U and also Smash Ultimate. So he passed away on July 22 due to esophageal cancer at the age of 56, which is far too young. It should be noted that Sakurai also tweeted about it saying that Okuma's legacy will live on in Smash 4 and Smash Ultimate. So that is, of course, a tragic loss and just the art world not having a good week in that regard.

625
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:59,380
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games coming out near you soon. How about the US Loki?

626
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:38,380
Naragami Gakuden Nanafushiji on Nintendo Switch, Full Metal Alchemist Mobile on iOS and Android. Oh, God. We have another life simulation game.

627
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:48,380
Guess Hiju, Mina de Chokomaka Muradukuri on Nintendo Switch.

628
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:56,380
Chomaka Muradukuri.

629
01:46:57,380 --> 01:47:01,380
Oh, because Makaemura is Ghost and Goblins series.

630
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:07,380
Yeah, I don't know if that's this. I mean, I don't think so. No, it's not from Capcom.

631
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:19,380
Yeah, it's from Nippon, Colombia, whatever that is. Hard West 2 on PC. Hindsight on PC, Nintendo Switch and iOS.

632
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:36,380
Kokoro Clover Season 1 on PC and Nintendo Switch. Sword and Fairy Together Forever on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Massage Freaks on Nintendo Switch. That's a rhythm game.

633
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:48,380
Picross X, Pikbits versus Oozboross. I don't know what Oozboross is. That's on Nintendo Switch, I think.

634
01:47:48,380 --> 01:48:13,380
And then Vanaris Tactics on PC. Bukora on PC, iOS and Android. Giga Bash on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. And last but not least, The 13th Month on PC, PlayStation 4 and I'm sorry, that was PC, iOS and Android. I'm glad that Smarch is getting representation in game form now.

635
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:25,380
Izzy Week. Let's go to Japan and check out the releases over there. So on the Nintendo Switch this week, we have that same game that Loki was talking about from Nippon, Colombia.

636
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:50,380
Gesshizu, Mina de Choko Maka Muradukuri is coming out on the Switch, as well as Let's Get Fit in a regular and one that includes the sports strap edition. We also have coming out in Japan on the Switch Apathy, Narugami Gakuen, Nana Fushigi comes out in a regular and limited edition on the Switch as well.

637
01:48:51,380 --> 01:49:04,380
That's pretty much it for the Switch. Taking a look at the PlayStation 5. Don't really have anything this week. We have Guilty Gear next week, but that's next week. So that's your Japanese releases. Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

638
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:10,380
Ultra Age on the 5th for PlayStation and Switch. That's it.

639
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:25,380
All right. A few more stories for you, and then we'll get to listener roundtable. Get to your emails. Participate at orangelandradio.com and any phone calls we might have tonight in our green room over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

640
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:35,380
And I would encourage you to join the Discord server anyway and chat with us throughout the week on a variety of topics. Lots of great stories and viewpoints getting exchanged in the Orange Launch Radio channel throughout the week.

641
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:53,380
And of course, our In Memoriam channel has been going off way too much this week with everything that's been going on. But check that out over Discord. We promise we limit the use of everyone's spam. In fact, I don't think we actually use it at all because I know how annoying that can be when you're in like 100 different Discord servers.

642
01:49:53,380 --> 01:50:04,380
So just get the chat that you want to get over on our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord. Okay, more news, starting with some drama. We love some drama, right, Loki?

643
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:25,380
Yeah, so VRChat is getting a controversial update very soon. They're going to be implementing or they announced that they're in their next up, they're going to be implementing Epic Games, easy anti cheat technology. And of course, this is going to crack down on any modified clients for the game.

644
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:47,380
And whereas you may see this to help combat like people hacking in VRChat, it's also affecting folks that are using modified clients for non nefarious reasons. Like for example, the VRCCC mod, which is a closed caption, or adds closed captions to the movie worlds.

645
01:50:47,380 --> 01:51:13,380
So deaf and hard of hearing people can watch movies with their friends that will no longer work anymore. There's an IK 2.0 update that which I are they're saying that there's some user made mods that were working with the client to help with body tracking. So they had maze IK 2.0 update that improve the body tracking that won't work anymore.

646
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:21,380
Um, yeah, so it's unfortunate to see all of this stuff that is being kind of affected by that.

647
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:49,380
Well, it's it's one of those things where they didn't think it through, you know, the the company didn't do the adequate amount of research to see what mods were out there, and at least try to address the issue of you know, their game needs to be more accessible by maybe having some of these mods built into the game before they hit the button on something like this, it's just going to kill all the mods. So I think that's just very poor research being done by the company, who for this feels like a reaction to this.

648
01:51:49,380 --> 01:52:01,380
Like something was going on in VR chat that in like, and so they use this as a kill switch that did that overextended it got this and way more stuff than it needed to.

649
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:30,380
So they did put out a a blog post on basically saying addressing your feedback, in which they talked about their plans, and you know, the security update and stuff like that. But then they just doubled down on it and didn't really apologize for anything. They just said, you know, that, you know, it's just an update, and it's, you know, dressing larger number of players are says, it's clear that the first up wait, you know, it's just an update.

650
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:49,380
The first up wave of promise updates will be only thing. So they're going to do some other things to update the game to help with, you know, some of these folks that are, you need like the closed captioning or other features in their other accessibility things. But I think that's gonna be too late at that point.

651
01:52:49,380 --> 01:53:18,380
Yeah, it should have been one of the first things to happen. And now, you know, if folks from this community decide to leave there, it's just going to, you know, their friends to leave, you know, why they want you to use, you know, why they want you to use the actual the, its own launcher is because they're going to start. I don't know, well, because I don't play VR chat. But from what I hear, they were going to be either starting to or adding more of monetization to it.

652
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:32,380
Where they're going to sell things. So of course, I think that they wanted to secure that so that there's no way to hack that stuff in there. But yeah, just start of it kind of going down, unfortunately.

653
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:47,380
Gdats in our chat says my partners way into VR chat, it's effectively impossible for them to coordinate reports of issues with their intention to expand the game and mods. Apparently mods are known for causing the false reports. Well, and yeah,

654
01:53:48,380 --> 01:54:16,380
that could be troublesome. Yeah, I could see. Yeah, for sure. What what cost right? Let's see. Sjoan Hunter Matt says I've heard mixed things about Oh, talking about a movie that was made in VR chat. Apparently, there's a movie that is on HBO Max. And I was not aware of this. And as Sjoan Hunter Matt says, I've heard mixed things about it. It was shot entirely in VR chat. I wonder if that won't be the first of several. Like it's just this interesting, you know.

655
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:45,380
You know, why not? We've heard of the Unreal Engine being made for things like animation and you know, the Unreal Engine being used in movies. Why not have this come full circle where you know, games are I mean, because you know, animation is animation, right? No matter how you do it. For some people, it's construction paper, like if you're the early days of South Park, now we have VR chat. So it's just another way to make movies. It's kind of neat. So all right.

656
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:53,380
Moving on, I had to let dark soccer talk about this because it's a game she talks a lot about. But I understand it's a good game.

657
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:39,380
Now, we already knew that there was going to be in Dead by Daylight, a Project W, a new Resident Evil themed chapter. And it's supposed to be out later this year. And it's going to have new survivors, new killer, but they've been leaked.

658
01:55:40,380 --> 01:56:00,380
I think the prestige cosmetics were actually leaked is what it was. So we have, and honestly, I'm going to do the killer last because I totally called this though for the first, the first chapter.

659
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:15,380
Yeah, I also think at this point, it's obvious if it's not Nemesis, it's who's left, you know, there's, there's other Yeah, it could have been it could have been Birkin. I would have loved to see Lady Dimitrescu. I know she's newer. I would have loved that. But anyway, and she's also very minor.

660
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:25,380
And she'll be back. I get with the fan reception and the fact that that voice actress wanted a word for the game. She'll be back. That's not going to be her last appearance.

661
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:36,380
But I'm saying right now, she was a minor character. She wouldn't be series wise as important as who they decided on.

662
01:56:36,380 --> 01:56:39,380
And Jason wasn't the killer in the first movie either. But anyway,

663
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:44,380
But, but Jason actually was the icon of it.

664
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:47,380
I know. Moving on.

665
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:58,380
It would be like if they took like Corey Feldman's character from, from Friday the 13th and made him like the main person in like a game now.

666
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:13,380
But, and it's Corey Feldman. Anyway, so we have from DBD leaks. There is a picture of what the new perks, the new survivors, plural, and killer.

667
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:24,380
So the first of the new survivors is Ada Wong and her lovely red dress outfit.

668
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:32,380
The second is Rebecca Chambers. So maybe she'll play the piano as her perk.

669
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:39,380
That's anyway, that's surprising. I'm surprised it's her because I think the early, early leaks said somebody else.

670
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:45,380
Ada Wong was always there. But again, like, how could it not be Ada Wong? That's right. Yeah.

671
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:51,380
That was missing. She's fire. Yeah. Now the killer, the killer.

672
01:57:51,380 --> 01:58:01,380
The person that I claimed it would be for the last chapter is the one for this chapter, and it is Albert Wesker.

673
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:10,380
And he's got a knife. And I'm pretty down for it. The new perks for Rebecca.

674
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:17,380
It looks like it's going to be reassurance, react.

675
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:25,380
Yeah, reassurance better than new and hyper focus because, you know, she was the team medic.

676
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:30,380
And then for Ada, it's reactive healing, low profile.

677
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:39,380
Basically, the icon is her taking off her high heels and walking barefoot and then wiretap, which I'm going to guess is an is an aura perk.

678
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:49,380
And then for Wesker's killer perks, we have terminus, awakened awareness and super anatomy.

679
01:58:49,380 --> 01:59:00,380
And the super anatomy icon looks like he's vaulting. I wonder if he's going to be like Legion.

680
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:07,380
Yeah, it's hard to know because we don't know what the perks do. We just know what they're called. But yes, we have the icons, though.

681
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:20,380
Yeah, just that one vaulting. I mean, so far, the only killer that can that has like a survivor style vault is Legion, and that requires being in frenzy.

682
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:31,380
And some killers can mess with vaults. Like I think a bamboozle from clown is kind of the go to or spirit. Spirit has an add on that can mess with them too.

683
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:44,380
And chlorophobia. That does it too. And wait, not chlorophobia. Yeah, chlorophobia does it. And there's also that one trickster one. The hex.

684
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:47,380
Oh, no, that's a blight, isn't it? Or is it?

685
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:50,380
You're right. Yeah, there's a hex term.

686
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:56,380
It's crowd control. Yeah, crowd control. Because I know it had to do with like his fandom stuff.

687
01:59:56,380 --> 02:00:05,380
But yeah, so I think it's kind of neat instead of having someone that affects the vault just to have someone who can just say screw it and vault.

688
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:14,380
Because people don't expect that. That's actually one of my favorite things about Legion is going into frenzy and vaulting something and having someone go, oh, shit.

689
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:23,380
So, speaking of rumors, if we're talking about Dead by Daylight rumors, the Stranger Things rumors are picking up steam again. I don't know where this is coming from.

690
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:32,380
I can tell you where it came from. So there were some fake leaks of a half rendered Vecna.

691
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:48,380
Right. And a few people who I thought were more reputable posted these pictures and said, oh, this is without a doubt, et cetera, blah, blah, blah, my butt.

692
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:57,380
And then after that, one of the same people, by the way, said, no, this is fake, this is fake.

693
02:00:57,380 --> 02:01:13,380
But then we had in the current tome, there is the scene of the two kids hiking and they come across a bunny and she tries to get the bunny to eat a carrot and the bunny will eat the carrot.

694
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:25,380
So she bites the carrot, holds it out and the bunny bites her. And then a swarm of those bunnies attack her and her friend. And they have Demogorgon mouths.

695
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:35,380
Oh, and that's why for the new tome, like some of the charms that came out are our bunnies with blood on them.

696
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:39,380
Interesting. Of course, you know what I keep thinking of that.

697
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:47,380
It's like, run away, run away. That rabbit's dynamite. We need a holy hand grenade right now.

698
02:01:47,380 --> 02:02:02,380
I really do hope this, I would love to see more Stranger Things content and more. I love the idea of Joyce as a survivor. I don't know if they would do, a lot of people are saying Eddie would be a great one. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see what happens.

699
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:16,380
So what you're saying is you want a Monty Python Dead by Daylight update. We can have the killer bunny. We can have King Arthur and then Sir Robin of Loxley. Or Sir Robin the Brave, I'm sorry.

700
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:19,380
They're not quite so brave as Sir Lancelot.

701
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:21,380
I'd be a funny April Fools if nothing.

702
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:28,380
Who personally wet himself at the Battle of Baden Hill. And then the aptly named Sir Not Appearing in this game.

703
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:38,380
On a somewhat related note with all this, Behavior Entertainment, the company behind Dead by Daylight, and of course, we know is making the Hooked on You dating sim. They're supposed to be having like an anniversary stream.

704
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:40,380
They're not making Hooked on You. Another company is making Hooked on You.

705
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:46,380
Oh, my bad. My bad. But they have like a 30th anniversary stream or so, which who knew that they've been around that long.

706
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:47,380
I mentioned it last week.

707
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:54,380
Right. Right. But this would be a time for them to announce things like that. Maybe. Maybe. Who knows?

708
02:02:54,380 --> 02:03:04,380
All right. Let's move on. More rumors. But now we let Dark Soccer talk about her game. Now we'll let you talk about yours, Loki. Rumors for the series you're into.

709
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:07,380
Hasn't been my game for a while now.

710
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:08,380
Fair.

711
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:09,380
It's fine.

712
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:27,380
I will fully play that when the next one comes out. But like, I'm just not, I'm not hyped about it better. It better not be one of those games as a service games without a single player. But anyways, Grand Theft Auto 6, obviously still something that's out there somewhere in development hell, I don't know.

713
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:50,380
But apparently Bloomberg has a report talking about some of the details of the game and how they want to kind of change up like the protagonists and all that stuff. So they're going to have a playable female protagonist. They say that she'll be a Latina and a part of I guess part of their parrot is going to be like some sort of Bonnie and Clyde type story.

714
02:03:50,380 --> 02:04:10,380
That sounds kind of cool. And then of course, they're saying that some of the things that are going to be different in this game versus other like Grand Theft Auto games is the whole sexualization of women in it. Obviously, you know, in the past, it's been something that they've done quite a bit. And it's just not necessarily something that's as appropriate anymore.

715
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:39,380
So and that also has to do with the fact that Rockstar is kind of moving away from that whole boys club thing into, you know, acting like, you know, professional people instead. So it'll be interesting to see what comes of all this stuff. I mean, cool that they have a female lead. They've done it before in other Grand Theft Auto games. It's just not mainline stuff that they had that in. But yeah, I mean, that's fine is also stories good.

716
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:54,380
I don't really care who the protagonists are. Right. It'd be cool if you could just go the same road route and just have a protagonist be, you know, not really a gender just have it whoever you want to be. Yeah, exactly.

717
02:04:54,380 --> 02:05:01,380
Yeah, I imagine for story purposes, that's why they're trying to kind of build it around a predetermined character. But I get it.

718
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:19,380
really need to because they've done this in Grand Theft Auto online, like Grand Theft Auto online, you play your own character, and it just works. Now I get it, like with the voice acting stuff like that. But like, you can get around that with just like how Saints Row does it. So I don't know, I think that that I'll be the way I would do it. But they can do it.

719
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:48,580
You can well in Mass Effect had two voice actors play the main part. So you could, you know, have Jennifer Hale or Marc Meir be your voice, you know, so it's, it's, it's a story that they want to tell. I'm cool that whatever. Yeah. All right. Well, speaking of people telling their own stories, for our last story tonight, let's talk a little bit about what happened with Nier because, man, did people did folks have people convinced that there was a new secret area in Nier

720
02:05:48,580 --> 02:06:17,900
Automata. And I'll just kind of tell you the end first. It turned out this whole thing was fake and was done by a very advanced sort of mod. A Redditor uploaded a video showing a new area in Nier Automata that pretty much nobody had ever seen before. It kind of led its way to like a church looking area kind of like behind like a hidden door or something. So there was a hallway that goes to a church and so forth. And this caused the community to go nuts because, you know, the

721
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:47,660
creators of this game have said a long time ago, everything has been found. But it would also not be unlike the creators of Nier to lie about that and have something secret there. So people were just, you know, going bonkers thinking, Oh, my gosh, is there this whole undiscovered thing we're just now finding? Well, again, as it turns out, nope, it was just a modder having a lot of fun. But boy, a lot of people bought it, but it was a very convincing mod, that's for sure. By the way, it's interesting, because

722
02:06:47,660 --> 02:07:17,580
Yosuke Saito, who's one of the producers of the game, didn't confirm or deny it, and just said eternal mystery in a tweet. So like they were throwing gasoline on the fire by tweeting like that. But again, that's how these devs are. And it's cool. So some folks in chat, Mike Deff says all that Nier story was fascinating and hilarious. Yeah, that's why I bring it up now. It's just I thought it was just funny how much, like not just the Reddit and the fans were buying into it.

723
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:20,060
But how the developers were having fun with it, too.

724
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:22,620
The video did look pretty neat.

725
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:46,460
Yeah, it was very convincing, wasn't it? It was. It looked really good. Fifth Dream in chat says this is like when the first Pokemon Gen 2 leaks happened. And the group had a Twitch stream where they mocked up a ROM hack and pretended it was the actual game. But a lot of it wasn't fake, but it was in a different form, and they didn't disclose that. So it's the lengths the folks will go to. So yeah, pretty cool.

726
02:07:48,140 --> 02:08:10,780
And a reminder that that game is coming out on the Nintendo Switch pretty soon that yeah, they're gonna scale that down for the Nintendo Switch. So that should be interesting. But if you haven't played it yet, I still need to finish it. But I enjoyed, added to the list, but I enjoyed what I did play of it. It's very, very, the music especially really caught my attention to that game. It's just such so well scored.

727
02:08:10,780 --> 02:08:38,700
All right, let's get to the listener roundtable. So every week we invite you to give us a call over at vog.network.com slash discord. But we also welcome your emails over at participate at orange lounge radio.com. And something I promised to get into in a recent episode was that we would do more tweets over at OLR if you have some tweets for us. So did you want to? Did you want to do tweets DarkSakra?

728
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:47,180
I'm sorry, not to I'm sorry, emails. Sorry. You're also muted. It's hard mute on Discord. See the icon?

729
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:54,260
Yeah, I can see it. Oh, I, I don't do tweets.

730
02:08:54,580 --> 02:09:00,660
I know. Sorry. Sorry. You were texting me something and it caused my wires to cross. Yeah.

731
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:19,660
All right. Hello, LR. Just a few thoughts on last week's episode. The classic game of the week was Mushihime-sama, an excellent cave shoot-em-up that I have very much enjoyed. But here's a bit of information that wasn't part of the segment. The game was actually re-released on Nintendo Switch about a year ago. It's 20 bucks. It's really good if you like games of this type. You should totally go buy it.

732
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:35,660
Logie lamented about how he can't get sim files for StepMania X and even offered to pay for them. Unfortunately, though, even if these were available, it would be physically impossible to play them on a DDR cabinet because of the game's five panel layout.

733
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:41,660
Yeah, but they have a four panel mode, though, in the game. So yes, it would be completely possible to do it.

734
02:09:42,660 --> 02:10:06,660
Because DDR machines, like I said, yeah, I know. I'm going to still read the email. Because DDR machines lack a center panel, the charts would all need to be redesigned to not use it. Also, the game does not separate charts into four panel, five panel, et cetera, like DDR used to. There are simply difficulty levels. So there is an actual reason why this don't exist. Sorry to be the bringer of bad news.

735
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:15,660
They have a no center mode that you can play because I played it in the arcade. It's just, you know, it'd be someone having to dump that. But yeah, I get it. It's not convenient.

736
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:33,660
Last but not least, I have heard a phrase during last week's show that truly horrified me simply because I believe it is thoroughly impossible to say 10 times fast ABBA album. Good luck. ABBA album isn't hard to say.

737
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:38,660
Um, thanks again for the show as always. Have a great week. Aaron Yyr.

738
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:48,660
Maybe ABBA Abacus album, but they didn't have an album called Abacus. Because ABBA doesn't do Abacus. But it's just a note to ponder for future weeks.

739
02:10:49,660 --> 02:11:01,660
All right. Thank you for the email Yyr. Participate at orangesonsrader.com if you want to send us an email. I will do some tweets. I haven't done tweets in a long time, but we have two tweets I want to get to tonight.

740
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:26,660
Uh, dark to see you tweeted us and I this was great because I checked this out today. I learned arcade infinity was also a hotspot for Street Fighter four. Yeah, it was it was huge for fighting games and not just music games. The times we have found this mini doc on YouTube from one of our former listeners. I happen to still be friends with on Facebook. Who is the former listener because I didn't catch who it was all grown up.

741
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:46,660
But I did watch the doc and the documentary was called a home for the SoCal FGC or fighting game community inside arcade infinity. And there was a lot of like photos and videos and I fucking took me back. It took me back and it got into the reasons why it closed.

742
02:11:46,660 --> 02:12:15,660
I didn't realize that the business didn't go belly up. The city was basically shutting them down because they didn't like all the kids hanging out there at three in the morning. Because remember how remember how that arcade was open late. It was open late. Like I think their posted hours were 2am like a bar. But I'm that place went to like three or 4am. So Oh, dark to see you said that was ryc three. I didn't know that. I remember that name from back in the day. Heck yeah.

743
02:12:16,660 --> 02:12:45,660
So check out the documentary. I thought it was cool. And it gives a little taste of what because they they do brush the music game thing a bit because they're talking about in the documentary about like, yeah, while people were waiting to play Street Fighter four, they had all of these music games and a lot of people that played this also played these over here. And just talking about the crossover between the two. So yeah, I didn't realize I mean, I probably knew it at the time but didn't forget because admittedly, I'm not as embedded in the fighting game community. I'm not as good as those games.

744
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:54,660
I appreciate them, but I don't follow them as closely. I did not realize arcade infinity was like the only place you could play Street Fighter four for a while. I didn't realize that.

745
02:12:56,660 --> 02:12:58,660
The thing about selling import cars.

746
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:12,660
They they brush on that a little bit in the documentary. I think it was just it was that was how they were getting all their machines was because of the inroads they made with the import car stuff. So they that part they brush on a little bit.

747
02:13:12,660 --> 02:13:14,660
I had actually been looking into getting a skyline.

748
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:16,660
That's cool.

749
02:13:16,660 --> 02:13:25,660
Oh, that's how I when I and when I was looking for, you know, a seller. I came across arcade infinity and I was like, what?

750
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:38,660
No, that's funny. All right. We do have a call waiting in the green room. So I want to go ahead and take this and then we'll get to another tweet here in a moment. But first, let's pull in our listener from the green room. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

751
02:13:38,660 --> 02:13:41,660
Hey, this is deaf. Hey, deaf. It's good to hear from you. What's up, buddy?

752
02:13:42,660 --> 02:14:07,660
I want to ask you a question, especially regarding a game that recently came out. Basically, my question is that has there been a game that you weren't interest at all? Like you didn't even care for it until you saw someone play it.

753
02:14:08,660 --> 02:14:16,660
And then you it's like, I want to play that play Dead by Daylight.

754
02:14:17,660 --> 02:14:19,660
And also the Mass Effect was like that for me, too.

755
02:14:20,660 --> 02:14:30,660
Yeah, I feel like Twitch has been really instrumental in finding a lot of that stuff, don't you think? I mean, that's for me anyway, I could say that.

756
02:14:31,660 --> 02:14:37,660
I'm trying to think of a specific game, though, like that.

757
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:45,660
A game that I watched people play and it made me want to play it because I hadn't really seen it before.

758
02:14:46,660 --> 02:15:01,660
You know, it probably wasn't until I really watched, you know, since we just talked about it, probably when I really started watching people playing Nier Automata that really made me interested in it because I kept writing it off because I had that original one on Xbox 360 that wasn't really Nier Replicant.

759
02:15:01,660 --> 02:15:11,660
They kind of changed it for this side and everything. And I was like, it wasn't that great. I don't know why people are really into that. And then when I kind of watched people play, I was like, Oh, this looks like it might be really cool.

760
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:21,660
So I think that would be maybe an answer for me. Or maybe even like if you want to go way back, maybe the first time I ever played DDR.

761
02:15:22,660 --> 02:15:30,660
I didn't know if it was something for me, but I watched other people playing and I thought this is so cool. But DDR at the time was such an extra machine to begin with.

762
02:15:31,660 --> 02:15:37,660
I mean, let's be real with the flashing lights and the cheesy techno music and also like that machine was just extra to begin with.

763
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:46,660
So watching the people because I've told this story on the show before I'm almost positive. The first time I ever saw DDR, I was walking into a tournament at Milpitas Golf Land.

764
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:54,660
But that wasn't the first time I played DDR. This is the first time I saw it because I couldn't get on the machine because it was surrounded by people and people doing stunts and things.

765
02:15:55,660 --> 02:16:05,660
But when I finally came across a machine in Las Vegas, we missed an entire night at the Rocky Horror Picture Show convention to stay up and play DDR instead.

766
02:16:06,660 --> 02:16:18,660
So that was my story with that. Pod Culture in chat says, Halo for me. That's a good one. Because I always wrote off Halo as shooty, shooty, bang, bang. I'm not going to be into it.

767
02:16:19,660 --> 02:16:29,660
But then when my friend had a Halo at his wedding reception, I kind of had to try it. And I was like, Oh, this is really fucking fun. Because they had the local area networked Xboxes.

768
02:16:30,660 --> 02:16:39,660
And we all played like in the same room. And it was it was a lot of fucking fun. So I was I was I was into it after that. I think that's a really good answer is Halo.

769
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:41,660
Loki, do you have one?

770
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:43,660
DDR.

771
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:45,660
Yeah, DDR as well. Yeah.

772
02:16:45,660 --> 02:16:46,660
Yeah.

773
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:50,660
Well, act deaf to you know, I love to turn the question back on the asker. What about you?

774
02:16:51,660 --> 02:16:58,660
Oh, and this is why I'm calling right now. And it's Digimon Survive, actually.

775
02:16:59,660 --> 02:17:02,660
Oh, I've been hearing a lot about this game this week. Tell me more.

776
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:20,660
Yeah, I've been watching a streamer I'm up for play this weekend. And I have heard about the game and it was Oh, it's a tactical RPG, hard visual novel and I wasn't like really interested in it, even though it's Digimon and I do like Digimon.

777
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:32,660
But after watching him play and seeing how the story develops, it's like, Oh my god, I really now I really want to play this game. Like, it's so so good.

778
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:44,660
And, and it's like, and again, it's like, I wasn't even like interested. It's like, I'll maybe play it if it comes to game pass or if I find it like cheap.

779
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:55,660
And it's like, No, now and now I want a physical copy of it. Because, again, the story is basically mostly the story that has been like, really, really good.

780
02:17:56,660 --> 02:18:05,660
Because it's not you think Digimon do you think? Oh, it's a it's a kid's game. It's a it's a it's a game for kids. It's nothing too serious.

781
02:18:05,660 --> 02:18:07,660
Just like Pokemon, right?

782
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:15,660
It lives up to its name. It's survived. It goes like, really, really hard.

783
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:17,660
Yeah. Okay.

784
02:18:18,660 --> 02:18:21,660
You don't have you don't have any idea. I probably don't.

785
02:18:22,660 --> 02:18:26,660
And for example, for Jamie that I know she loves Digimon.

786
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:36,660
The first season or adventure, the parallels between this game and that season are like, really, really close.

787
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:44,660
So I think if you like the story from Digimon adventure, the first season you're gonna you're gonna love this.

788
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:47,660
The first two seasons were my favorite. Those are the cast that I care about.

789
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:51,660
You know, the parallels between the characters are really similar.

790
02:18:52,660 --> 02:18:53,660
You know, it's really Oh, go ahead, Jamie.

791
02:18:54,660 --> 02:19:12,660
I just said cool. Oh, um, you know, it's really interesting to me how how influential like the Twitch culture and YouTube culture, you know, just streaming and all that really can play into like there's there's a reason why companies will pay influencers and people with a lot of viewers, sometimes maybe not even a lot of viewers like I've been asked to do it in the past.

792
02:19:12,660 --> 02:19:20,660
I don't have that huge of an audience. But there's a reason why companies will maybe not like I didn't get paid in that circumstance, but I got a free copy of the game.

793
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:29,660
And I was like, All right, sure. But there's a reason why companies will dangle those carrots to try to get exposure because it's when people watch others play it that they go, Oh, maybe this is pretty cool.

794
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:35,660
And even though I didn't explicitly stay at dead dead by daylight was absolutely one for me as well.

795
02:19:36,660 --> 02:19:40,660
Because I watched Alan play it and play it and play it and I was like, what is so fucking great about this game.

796
02:19:40,660 --> 02:19:49,660
And then I watched people play it on Twitch. And I was like, Oh, you know, I watched like, a lot of LGBT, you know, a lot of the LGBTQ community plays dead by daylight.

797
02:19:50,660 --> 02:20:00,660
And I watched some really relatable people playing the game. And I was like, Oh, this is actually like, even though I don't like scary all the time and the heartbeat thing kind of this actually looks like it could be a lot of fun.

798
02:20:01,660 --> 02:20:08,660
And I got into it. So yeah, and I keep saying Twitch, Twitch, Twitch, but the same thing's true about YouTube, you know, and the videos over there and so forth.

799
02:20:08,660 --> 02:20:15,660
So it's just, it's interesting how that whole sense of exposure is really important in this day and age for your game. Absolutely.

800
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:24,660
Which is curious, because nobody got a review copy of Digimon Survive. The marketing is almost unexistent.

801
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:26,660
Interesting.

802
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:31,660
Yeah, it's weird, but people are talking about it. So that's great.

803
02:20:31,660 --> 02:20:38,660
Do you know another game that the publisher completely wrote off and then, you know, then just became a huge monster hit? Until Dawn.

804
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:48,660
You might remember was kind of written off by Sony in many ways, like it was originally announced to the PS3, and it kind of disappeared and got released without a lot of fanfare.

805
02:20:48,660 --> 02:21:02,660
But then, again, I would say in big part, thanks to streaming, and that whole thing became huge. And now we have the quarry, we have the Medal of Medan and the Dark Pictures Anthology and all those games are all because of that.

806
02:21:03,660 --> 02:21:13,660
So it's interesting how that that and God probably things like Minecraft, you know, were huge because of streaming and so forth. You know, it's just interesting how much that has really affected things.

807
02:21:13,660 --> 02:21:23,660
Dr. Tsubita answered your question, and I thought this was a clever answer. It wasn't a video game, but that does kind of start sound like my start with Magic the Gathering.

808
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:36,660
Everyone in my high school was getting into it. So I had to see what the fuss was all about. So that that pure influence. Absolutely. And pure influence isn't necessarily, you know, in that case, he's probably talking about the school lunchroom table.

809
02:21:36,660 --> 02:21:48,660
But, you know, thanks to technology, we've got a big table now and lots of people showing off what they're playing. But I love the question, Deft. Any other comments or thoughts for us tonight?

810
02:21:49,660 --> 02:21:50,660
No, that will be all.

811
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:54,660
All right. Well, thank you so much. Have a wonderful week and may all your Pokémon be shiny.

812
02:21:55,660 --> 02:21:56,660
Thank you.

813
02:21:56,660 --> 02:21:57,660
All right. Take care, my friend.

814
02:21:58,660 --> 02:22:09,660
All right. Always good to hear from Act Deft. Let's get to the other tweet I wanted to read while we do a last call for any calls tonight on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

815
02:22:10,660 --> 02:22:21,660
We got another tweet from Blue Swim, who passed along, hey, saw this and immediately thought of you all. And it was a quote tweet for a sad day for Bomani Games.

816
02:22:22,660 --> 02:22:37,660
The last DDR Kids cabinet is going to be removed from public access at this time with a little Facebook post that says for those in the area, the last and only public DDR Kids machine is going away at the arcade that houses it at the end of August.

817
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:48,660
Sayama Cat's Eye is in Saitama. It is in the kids play area, not the arcade area. So you need to pay to get into that part first and then you can play it for free all you want.

818
02:22:49,660 --> 02:22:59,660
I had forgot there was a DDR Kids machine. But then when I saw the screen, I was like, oh, yeah, that was a thing. So but, you know, a little piece of history.

819
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:13,660
Let's let's be honest, though, as much as yes, the news is sad. Let's also be impressed that here it is the year 2022 and that machine was still standing quite honestly. I think that's pretty incredible. So all right.

820
02:23:13,660 --> 02:23:24,660
All right. Well, I think that's going to do it. That was all the emails. That was all the calls. That was all the tweets. So thank you so much for that. If you have a tweet you want to send us in a future week at OLR.

821
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:40,660
Mike Deft in chat wanted to amend his call and just mention, oh, something I did forget to add about Digimon Survive. It is mostly a visual novel. The tactical game is like only 25% of the game. But the story again is really engaging and your decisions have an impact on the story.

822
02:23:41,660 --> 02:23:49,660
Hey, just because it's a visual novel doesn't make it bad. Hello, dream daddy. Need I say more? All right. Hot to full boyfriend. Need I say more? All right.

823
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:53,660
Yeah, I mean, that's those are the fun things. I enjoy that.

824
02:23:54,660 --> 02:24:12,660
Exactly. Exactly. Wow. As you're wondering, Matt says NYC got rid of the last phone booze in Times Square, which led to young people to say what's a phone booth? Well, you know, people it's it's that thing you go into so you can make a private cell phone call because that's how people only use them anymore is to go into them to make a cell phone call.

825
02:24:13,660 --> 02:24:18,660
But, you know, people, people deface those things in many sorts of ways now. So I'm not surprised to getting rid of them.

826
02:24:19,660 --> 02:24:24,660
You want to know what relic though I still see like certain Kaiser locations like the hospitals and whatnot.

827
02:24:25,660 --> 02:24:30,660
Pay phones with the TTY, a teletypewriter. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

828
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:45,660
Which now you have phone relay services instead that that they do. Like, I had to actually break myself of my habits from TTY because I used to, you know, answer phone calls from my uncle sometimes.

829
02:24:45,660 --> 02:24:53,660
All right. Well, I think that is going to do actually I should check in for any last minute stories, Loki.

830
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:55,660
Nope, don't have any.

831
02:24:56,660 --> 02:25:01,660
I figured it's actually all when I'll send that it was a little bit slower of a Newsweek but you know, they can't they can't all be action packed.

832
02:25:02,660 --> 02:25:08,660
All right. That means it's time for us to get around to final thoughts and good night. I want to say thanks as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

833
02:25:08,660 --> 02:25:14,660
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

834
02:25:15,660 --> 02:25:24,660
But we need more voices here to put them out on air. So please tell a friend a nice five star review wherever you found this show, whether it be iTunes, Spotify, whatever.

835
02:25:25,660 --> 02:25:31,660
Go ahead and click that five star button and that goes a long way as well. In fact, I don't think we've had a written review on iTunes in like three years.

836
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:37,660
So if somebody wanted to be so kind as to write us a nice review, we wouldn't say no to that. So thank you. Thank you.

837
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:47,660
Appreciate all that. Let's go around and get folks final thoughts. I will start as usual dark soccer because I know she's going to do some streaming of her own in a minute.

838
02:25:48,660 --> 02:25:56,660
I am going to be joined by Finora for some Debbie Delight. If you or anyone wants to join us, we would love to have you along.

839
02:25:57,660 --> 02:26:01,660
I might pop in for a little bit. I have to see what Alan's got planned this evening, but I should be able to join for a little bit.

840
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:11,660
All right. Well, and also I all of you are awesome. And don't forget to to share your awesomeness with the world.

841
02:26:12,660 --> 02:26:17,660
All right. I'll try. All right. Take care, Darksira. Loki, we'll go to you. Your final thought tonight.

842
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:24,660
My final thought is I will try to get a new episode of my Minecraft series out this week.

843
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:28,660
Sounds good. I'm kind of ahead of the game, so it's fine if I take a little longer.

844
02:26:28,660 --> 02:26:36,660
All right. My final thought, I will try to do some streaming of my own this week. So follow my personal channel if you're not already at Rob Roberts.

845
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:50,660
And also trying to brainstorm some things for our lovely network here at the voice geeks network and things to push our website forward, hopefully a little bit, because we haven't had a lot of network content in a while, but I'm brewing some ideas.

846
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:58,660
So Mr. Black Wolf and I luckily have Dragon Con coming up to talk about them. So I hope to see folks at Dragon Con if you're in the area.

847
02:26:59,660 --> 02:27:03,660
And I understand times are still weird. The pandemic is not truly over, even though everyone seems to be over it.

848
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:09,660
So I totally get people's hesitations. It's all good. You make the shot. You make the call that's best for you.

849
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:17,660
But if you are interested in going to a big convention, I love Dragon Con in Atlanta area. This will be my 10th year in person, I believe, if I did my math right.

850
02:27:17,660 --> 02:27:27,660
No, no, I think 2012 was my first year because that was the first year of VOG. But I can't count 2020 because we all know why I can't count 2020.

851
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:35,660
But it's getting to the point I'm losing count of how many times I've been to Dragon Con. I love it so much. So I'm looking forward to seeing everybody there again Labor Day weekend, hopefully.

852
02:27:36,660 --> 02:27:43,660
All right, that's it. We'll see you in seven days. It'll be August, believe it or not. I can't believe it. It's already going to be August.

853
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:54,660
Pumpkin spice lattes will be here before you know it. Hang on. I know but you know, you know, it sucks because unless they have a sugar free pumpkin, those days are over for me, which is sad.

854
02:27:55,660 --> 02:28:06,660
Oh, do they? Yeah, they have. Hell yes. Let the pumpkining begin. Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.

855
02:28:07,660 --> 02:28:09,660
