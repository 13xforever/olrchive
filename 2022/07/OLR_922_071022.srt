1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,640
I'm browsing through the stories that will be discussed tonight and make mental notes

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,440
about what I might highlight here.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,680
Towards the end, I read an article that is pretty normal, but while reading it, my smile

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,080
gets continually bigger.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,800
The first C64 collection for the Evercade is going to include Summer Games, Winter Games,

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,560
Impossible Mission, Jumpman, and more, but those first four delighted me specifically.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,120
I'm so vain, I think this story was written for me, but now it's time for your hosts,

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,360
Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give you details about this release and the rest

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
of the week's gaming news.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,800
Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,120
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,080
where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:55,120
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 922 of our

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,320
show for tonight, July the 10th of 2022.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,440
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always every week for the past 20 plus years

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
with my co-hosts.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,840
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Hi.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
Hi.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,160
I can say that now, 20 plus years.

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
Yes.

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,480
How are you doing?

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
I'm all right.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:27,120
My office is in a lot of disarray since I am going through my uncountable number of

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,240
art supplies and trying to organize them, so it's a mess.

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
That's all right.

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
You know what?

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
It's organized chaos.

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
No, it's not organized.

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
But what I-

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,800
It absolutely is chaos.

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,160
But what I do like is that now you have some lights wrapped around your microphone there,

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
so you have-

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
That aren't on.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,800
You're so little flourish there.

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
There we go.

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I was seeing that before the show tonight.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
It's messy as hell.

39
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
But I know the podcast-

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,080
Not bad for an Etsy find.

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,280
I know the podcast listeners can't see it, sorry, but we do tape live every Sunday night

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,520
at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

43
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,880
VOG Network, where you can see video and subscribers here at the VOG Network.

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,960
Twitch can check out the video on demand throughout the week.

45
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,200
So yeah, but we try to minimize our visual discussions best we can because it is ultimately

46
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,120
a podcast at the end of the day.

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,580
And pod culture in our chat while we are taping live says it's a Tron mic.

48
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,920
Sounds like-

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
That was the idea.

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
That's the idea.

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
All right.

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
I like that.

53
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
I like that.

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Which by the way, how nice is this?

55
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,640
Great minds think alike as I show you my Flynn's Arcade shirt because Tron-

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
I'm wearing-

57
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
One of your merch.

58
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,560
Yes, the Hook of Shame, my newest shirt.

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,240
The Flynn's Arcade is not merch.

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,560
I don't even remember where I bought this, but it does, like Tron is like 40 years old

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
at this point.

62
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
So-

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,200
Yeah, it actually hit its 40th anniversary.

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Yeah.

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Yeah.

66
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
So that's the thing.

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,540
So it's funny that you and I are on the same wavelength of Tron tonight.

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,920
So let's check in with Techmaster Loki.

69
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,440
What Tron inspired thing did you bring to the discussion tonight, Loki?

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,600
I brought Jared Leto to ruin the franchise.

71
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Send it back.

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Send it back.

73
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,200
No, it looks actually based on the game that's playing behind you.

74
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,280
It looks like you brought Arnold Schwarzenegger to wreck the franchise with, now I know that

75
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,240
one, T2, the arcade game.

76
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,300
Heck yeah.

77
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,280
What made you think of T2 tonight?

78
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,860
Because there's a new Terminator game that's coming.

79
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,860
Is there a new one?

80
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,860
Yeah.

81
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,860
Oh.

82
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,860
There's a new one.

83
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,480
Like a shoot-em-up like the old, like that one?

84
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,640
It's a survival game.

85
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:40,720
I don't know if it's a shoot-em-up, but I mean, this one's my favorite in the arcade.

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,760
You have a few people in chat speaking up, as shown here, Matt says T2 arcade was a massive

87
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
token eater.

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,600
That stupid truck protection stage sucked.

89
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,980
Questmaster says T2 arcade was great and also knows little known about it, this new Terminator

90
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,160
survival game, but it's planned.

91
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,560
I also, you know, those T2, you know, these arcade one-ups, which, you know, I have not

92
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,560
to be a shill for them, but the reality is you can see one behind me here as we broadcast

93
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,560
live on Twitch, because I have a limited edition BurgerTime, although I don't know how limited

94
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,660
it is because I think they're still on sale on the website, but I digress.

95
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,480
They also have a Terminator 2 one.

96
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,040
It's expensive because it's not the same, though, because they made it a light gun game

97
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,880
and the Terminator 2 game was not a light gun game.

98
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,760
It had like an Uzi that I think is just operating like a joystick that you would move around

99
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,940
and aim with, but it wasn't a light gun game from my memory, at least could be wrong, but

100
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm pretty sure it wasn't.

101
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,760
But yeah, I remember I had that game on PC, like back in the day, bought a boxed copy

102
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,160
of it to play on PC and that was fun.

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,920
They had a version of it on like Super Nintendo, didn't they?

104
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,480
I guess you had to use the controller to move the crosshair.

105
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
I think they did, yeah.

106
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Yeah.

107
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
So, all right.

108
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,240
All right, well, we're going to get into some news tonight and we'll talk about our gaming

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,760
weeks as well, and this is a pretty interesting place to start.

110
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,360
I was a little surprised to hear this this week.

111
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Let's get into it.

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,480
Loki, what is the big headline of the week tonight?

113
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,240
It's coming back, baby.

114
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,480
E3, you know, you've been waiting for it.

115
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,560
Well, now they're going to bring it to its physical form.

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,120
Of course, this isn't even my final form.

117
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,900
It's going to be New Planner, so they're going to have the folks behind the PAX conventions

118
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,000
and New York Comic Con.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,800
Repop are going to be organizing it and it's supposed to be coming back in 2023, although

120
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,560
as you probably can guess, it's probably going to be less like E3 and I think more like the

121
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,320
E4ALL that they did.

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
So we'll see.

123
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,280
Yeah, I don't know.

124
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,440
I don't think it needs to come back.

125
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,880
It's interesting that you compare it to E4ALL and not PAX, who Repop also is probably best

126
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,400
known for running, at least in gamer circles, because they took that over from the actual

127
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,360
Penny Arcade team years ago.

128
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Yeah.

129
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Yeah.

130
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,360
E4ALL is kind of like what I remember what they did with E3, where it was we're opening

131
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,600
to the public and all that kind of stuff.

132
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,040
But yeah, it's just kind of, I don't know.

133
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,840
I don't think it needs to exist.

134
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,720
Well, it's it's I'm going to say this as much as I've been critical of E3 and I've been

135
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,400
very critical of E3.

136
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,560
And that's mostly how the ESA really mishandled it in the last several years, not just because

137
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
of the pandemic.

138
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:45,560
I'm not going to fault the ESA for the pandemic canceling E3 for, you know, 2020 and 2021.

139
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,840
I feel like they probably could have done a little something something this year, even

140
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,320
if in limited capacity.

141
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,120
But OK, so, yeah, I mean, COVID isn't exactly gone, so I can see why they've shied away

142
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,440
from it this year as well.

143
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:05,320
But I have to admit with this year and there not being an E3, it does feel off like this

144
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,440
whole summer game fest and whatever.

145
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
That's not the same thing.

146
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,120
You know, and I think it's because there isn't that tent pole that everybody is making their

147
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,440
announcements around.

148
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,200
You don't have that singular week where you can expect Sony makes announcements, Microsoft

149
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,160
makes announcements, Nintendo makes announcements.

150
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Microsoft is the only one that made announcements.

151
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,340
They did a fine job, but it it was just kind of that was it was just announcements and

152
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,960
it does it does feel like something's missing.

153
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,760
I mean, yeah, but like, I don't know how keen they're going to be to want to spend the millions

154
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,480
on a booth and stuff when they're probably finding similar, if not better success with

155
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,620
these digital events.

156
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,240
It's like, what's really going to convince them to come back?

157
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,200
And like, I just don't see that happening.

158
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,120
Yeah, they may do it around the same time like they did this year, like with the Microsoft

159
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,760
Bethesda stuff.

160
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,000
I just don't really see it coming back to being the E3 we once remembered where it's

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,400
like all of like these big announcements and everything around that time.

162
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,260
But like, I think a lot of these companies are just going to be kind of hold them back

163
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,260
on their stuff.

164
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,600
You may have like demos and stuff.

165
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,600
I don't think it's going to be anything different than you see, like a PAX or Comic Con or anything

166
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
like that.

167
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't think it's going to be this major event unless the ESA is willing to put the

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,240
money where their mouth is and in partnership with Read Pop, throw a lot of money at a company

169
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
like Nintendo.

170
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,280
And honestly, I'm going to be quite honest, Nintendo is the only one they need on board.

171
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,240
They can even get by without the other two.

172
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,360
I think Microsoft will just kind of do it because they tend to do these things.

173
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
But the only one they really need is Nintendo.

174
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,520
And if Nintendo, I mean, come on, look at any other E3 and look at like where the mad

175
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,640
rush in that line always goes.

176
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,060
Like I'm just I'm telling it like it is.

177
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,460
And you I love all the platforms.

178
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,460
I love PlayStation.

179
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,940
I love Microsoft.

180
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,900
There's something about Nintendo and the way that it speaks to the gamer population and

181
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,580
the kid in us or whatever, that people always rush their booth first.

182
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,100
So the only people they really, really need to get on board with this is Nintendo and

183
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,260
their show will be fine.

184
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,680
It you know, I and here's the thing, I don't want to speak too positively of this because

185
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,400
the reality is E3, if it's coming back, it's and I saw this name during Bobby show.

186
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,600
This is completely appropriate.

187
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,840
It's zombie three.

188
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,080
It is not going to be the same E3 that you knew 20 years ago.

189
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,720
Now granted, for better and for worse, because we know there were a lot of issues with E3

190
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,120
back in the day.

191
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,780
But at the end of the day, E3 was a trade show, right?

192
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:47,260
It was for people in the industry, whether you like it or not, to be able to network

193
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,580
to be able to, you know, get advances of what was going to be coming out through the rest

194
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,820
of the years that people that were, you know, writing articles without advance magazines

195
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,940
and so forth, got a sneak peek at that for retailers to get an idea what you know, campaigns

196
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,580
they're going to want to run to try to push, you know, these things towards the end of

197
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
the year.

198
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,540
This was a trade event.

199
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,720
Now unless we are corrected otherwise, and I doubt it, depending or based on who this

200
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,220
new partner is in this, E3 is not a trade show anymore.

201
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:26,100
E3 is a fan convention, which congratulations gamers, you won.

202
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,340
You're going to get you're finally going to get what you always wanted a public E3 congratulations.

203
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,340
You got it.

204
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,980
But guess what?

205
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,060
It's not going to be as good as the E3 that existed back in the day.

206
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
And it's not me being an elitist.

207
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,420
That's just me being factual.

208
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,300
And it gives me even less interesting going.

209
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,340
Yeah, it's well, and it's because the internet is a thing.

210
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:54,860
And it's because you're going to have companies that are less likely to put out their pre-builds

211
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:02,700
and early access demos in front of the public, because the public can be a bunch of bitches.

212
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,420
Load Twitter during any public gaming event, and you can see how the public can be very

213
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,900
unkind to games.

214
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,900
So if...

215
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,660
The public is just unkind to begin with.

216
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,700
I don't know what they're thinking.

217
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,860
That's true.

218
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:25,480
They're, they're going, they're going to only show you games that will be out that summer.

219
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,380
So like, let's, let's say read pop E3 was happening this year.

220
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,700
Bayonetta would go, and the game that they would be showing off that would have the long

221
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,280
line, Splatoon 3, which is out in what, two months, if that?

222
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,660
That's the big game they would show.

223
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,520
They would not show you Bayonetta 3.

224
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,740
They would not show, they certainly as fuck are not going to show you Breath of the Wild

225
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
2.

226
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,380
They might, but they might have a trailer on the big screen.

227
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,980
We'll give it, maybe, maybe, maybe a read pop E3 would have given us a new trailer on

228
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,980
the big screen.

229
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,580
You sure as fuck wouldn't play that on the show floor right now.

230
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,460
Absolutely not.

231
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,500
So that's, that's it.

232
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,460
And our chat, of course, is lighting up.

233
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,500
Sj100matt in chat says, I guess read pop does have the connections to try to sway these

234
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,540
companies to come in, but it really doesn't seem like these companies are willing to sway

235
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,060
from doing their own direct style model.

236
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm going to stand by what I said.

237
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,420
They only need one company to agree to it.

238
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,140
If they get the one company on board, E3 will be all right.

239
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,700
E3 might be a decent fan show.

240
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,600
Now I have my own issues with read pop and why I don't participate with PAX East anymore.

241
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,580
I don't know how much of that old dirt I want to dig up because it is old dirt.

242
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,540
It dates all the way back to PAX East a long time ago.

243
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,900
But needless to say, there's a reason, PAX burned their bridge with me.

244
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,660
I didn't burn my bridge with PAX.

245
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,700
PAX burned their bridge with me.

246
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,120
So I, I'm, there's a reason why I've never gone back.

247
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,960
And I'm not exactly excited to go to this new E3.

248
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,720
But I'm certainly curious.

249
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,160
I realize the potential that's there.

250
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,600
I realize there is a certain type of weight behind the name.

251
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,640
I realize there is a nostalgia and something does feel missing this year.

252
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,920
I'm just not sure this is going to fix all the problems.

253
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,600
As Joan Hunter-Matt says, the new E3 with carnival rides, figuratively three hour long

254
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,080
signs, merch tables, and covered by G4.

255
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,820
You better believe they're going to be there.

256
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Of course.

257
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,800
And they'll, they'll probably have celebs in the gaming industry available at tables

258
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,640
to sign things.

259
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,440
That's how, you know, it's, if anybody is selling an autograph at E3, I'm telling you

260
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,380
that is not the E3 that it used to be.

261
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,480
Bobby Black Wolf, of course, with an analogy that has been covered before, but it is, it

262
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
is great.

263
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,520
Ten years ago, I said that PAX was what people who never went to E3 thought E3 was like.

264
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,400
Now, E3 will be what people who never went to E3 thought E3 was like.

265
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Sure.

266
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,200
I, okay, fine.

267
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
I don't mind.

268
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,680
I don't, I'll, I'll drudge up the dirt.

269
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Why not?

270
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Bobby Black Wolf in chat.

271
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
I'll spill the tea in chat.

272
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Fine.

273
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
I'll read it.

274
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,000
Rob and I were invited to PAX East to be on a panel about gaming podcasts.

275
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,280
The panel was cut at the last minute for the schedule.

276
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,240
We had already bought flights and hotels.

277
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,520
We applied as media and were denied.

278
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,960
They wanted us to be on a panel to speak about gaming media, but ultimately decided we were

279
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,960
not gaming media.

280
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,320
Unprofessionalism, it's too much.

281
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Anyway, Questbuster in chat says, in before another story of a stolen demo at E3 shows

282
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
up.

283
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Yeah.

284
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Yeah.

285
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,840
Better, better keep those under lock and key.

286
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Oh yeah.

287
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,920
E3 100 Matt says, Oh, I forgot NFTs and the blockchain will be there.

288
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Yeah.

289
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,080
Um, by the way, Bobby, the one part you left out that's important in that story is that

290
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,480
the public tickets had already been sold.

291
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,680
When we asked about trying to get a public ticket, we were told there was nothing they

292
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
could do.

293
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,260
If we did not have a listener who had happened to buy extra tickets, we would have flown

294
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,360
out there for literally nothing.

295
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,500
And then I would really be pissed.

296
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,400
At least I was able to record a podcast on the show floor with some friends.

297
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:23,060
So I feel like I got something done, but yeah, that was some, anyway, now, you know, if you

298
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:30,060
didn't know now, you know, so, um, and that's why I'm likely not going to be going to the

299
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
new E3 either.

300
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,540
It's going to take a lot to convince me.

301
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,220
I should waste my time with the new E3.

302
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,380
Now granted, and I've been saying this on Twitter and I do believe this, but even after

303
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:47,620
telling you that story via Bobby, even after all that, I think this is better than nothing.

304
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,540
And it's, it's going to be in a better place than where the ESA had it.

305
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,100
The bar was pretty low.

306
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,940
At least if you go, your information should not be stolen and published online, at least

307
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,660
by a company who claims to represent the electronic entertainment industry.

308
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
At least there's that.

309
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,300
They ever do anything with that?

310
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,820
No, they swept it, just hoped it would disappear.

311
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,060
And of course, because the gaming media does not have a great attention span and is not

312
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,980
great on follow-up, uh, it disappeared, but no, nothing ever came of that.

313
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:29,580
So that's that, uh, anyway, um, so I don't know, um, dark Sakura, I, I w I want to go

314
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,500
back to you cause you've been chiming in that you're not very, you're like, whatever with

315
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,580
this E3, can you elaborate on your thoughts?

316
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,540
Like what, what makes you go hard pass on this E3?

317
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:46,060
It's the fact that I haven't cared about E3 in years, really.

318
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:52,940
I just don't have anything in me to give it any attention, especially if it's going to

319
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,600
be just another con.

320
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,340
I could go to a smaller gaming convention and have a lot more fun than I would at a

321
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,220
big corporate stick up the ass thing like this.

322
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,380
That's why I stopped going to Anime Expo.

323
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,540
That's why I will still sometimes go to Fanime, but even Fanime has kind of turned into something

324
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,680
like that.

325
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,440
You know, I don't like going to big cons anymore.

326
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,620
I don't like the over-commercialization.

327
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:22,780
I go to see the, the, well, in the past I would go see the anime and see the cosplay.

328
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,620
And for a game con, I would go to see the games.

329
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:33,700
That's why I liked old E3, even though it was, you know, all swag and booth babes and

330
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,340
shit and sometimes you would get free balls out of the deal, the soda, not somebody's

331
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
balls.

332
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,860
It was also the only place I ever got diet balls, it was so weird.

333
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,380
But back, back to my point, though, I could go...

334
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,420
For those who are watching their ball intake.

335
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Yes.

336
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:58,740
But at any, at any rate, it was one place I could go and see the games, see the prototypes,

337
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,320
see what was new, talk to people in the industry, get ideas.

338
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:12,760
You know, honestly, going to the parties for GDC were a lot more like old E3 to me.

339
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:23,440
And I mean, this is why I'm actually considering making GDC my thing because I'm working on...

340
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,560
I'm doing a little bit for my web comic, but it's based on a visual novel engine.

341
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,800
So...

342
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,160
I think, and I know you've also spoken about wanting to go to TwitchCon and...

343
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,280
I am going to TwitchCon.

344
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
I think Twitch...

345
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
I just need somewhere to stay.

346
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,680
I think TwitchCon is going to be great because it's about the community and not about the

347
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
games necessarily.

348
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,880
And a lot of people from the community plan to be there.

349
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,400
So that's, that's a big part of it.

350
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,080
I know we're having a big Debbie party.

351
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,480
But you, for me, you hit the nail on the head when you talked about how they're smaller

352
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,720
and less important cons that you get a lot more value out of in attending and a hundred

353
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,640
percent that part.

354
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,360
So there's that.

355
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,920
By the way, Bobby Black Wolf is plugging one of them, Southern Fried Gaming Expo is next

356
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,520
weekend, which is a mid-sized con and VOG is sponsoring it out in Atlanta.

357
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,320
So check that out if you're in the Atlanta area.

358
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,440
Well, there's another thing though, and that's honestly artist alleys, which E3 didn't have.

359
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:38,000
But when you have an artist alley at a big convention versus one at a smaller con, the

360
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,440
artists from, in my, in my experience, get more out of the smaller cons.

361
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,280
They have to pay less for their places and the big corporate ones are trying to milk

362
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,520
them less, you know?

363
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,680
So there's also that to me.

364
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,800
That gives me a chance to actually some more, especially for a gaming convention, I've been

365
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:11,160
able to support smaller developers like my friend who's working on Potato Tail.

366
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,520
Bonstablo 6 in chat says Blurred Con was this weekend.

367
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Next big East Coast con is Otakon in the Walter Reed Convention Center in Washington, D.C.

368
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
You know.

369
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Not interested in that.

370
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
It's too big.

371
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,800
Blurred Con, I bet is awesome.

372
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,800
And those cons that are about communities.

373
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
I really miss...

374
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,000
DJ Rama S says F that con.

375
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,880
Oh, there must be a story there.

376
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
All right.

377
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,200
I really miss Gamer X.

378
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,600
Now, I understand messy things happened, but I miss what it was with the community and

379
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
everything.

380
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,360
And that was a great sized con and everything, you know, that was, I had some really good

381
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
memories there.

382
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,400
So that was very cool.

383
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,680
By the way, because Bobby had brought up Southern Fried Gaming Expo, I was curious because,

384
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,840
you know, there's we have our own version of that out here, which I think was the inspiration

385
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
for that.

386
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,120
We have California Xtreme and I was looking into it.

387
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,260
Is this month that I'm going?

388
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
It is.

389
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,260
It's July 30th.

390
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,880
Do you know for the first time, and I can't remember since when, I don't have any plans

391
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,320
that weekend already.

392
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,040
I don't have a conflicting show.

393
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,460
I don't have a conflicting show because the Rocky show got canceled this month.

394
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
So I...

395
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,300
Yeah, I may actually want to go this year.

396
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,300
I'm still kind of feeling out the COVID stuff a little bit, but I think, you know, I think

397
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
it'll be all right.

398
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,300
So, yeah.

399
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,380
Well, I did Pinagogo and honestly, that was all right.

400
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,380
Yeah.

401
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,140
Not Pinagogo, but Golden State Pinball Festival.

402
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,380
Plus the mass compliance is just, odds are it's going to be a lot better here than it

403
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,380
is.

404
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,420
I mean, I am going to Dragon Con and I already know, all right, if I don't get COVID by then,

405
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:56,940
it's probably going to be a high risk situation, but I'm just hoping we have the COVID variant

406
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,180
shot available by then because I know they're working on finishing that up.

407
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,180
So we'll see.

408
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,180
Fingers crossed.

409
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,780
But yeah, California Extreme, I'd love to go to that if it could work out.

410
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,380
So that'd be cool.

411
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,780
Well, you need a ride.

412
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,780
Yeah.

413
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,780
I'll...

414
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,780
You can hang with the pinball crew.

415
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,780
I'll be in touch.

416
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:21,580
Anyway, so let's see, genuine excitement when we talk about these mid local, more direct

417
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:26,080
type of cons, these big bloated things, I'm over it.

418
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
Maybe it's just my age.

419
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
I'm over it.

420
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
I don't know.

421
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,300
Well, it's just, it's a big, like, if you look at E3, like let's just say from our perspective,

422
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,300
like to see anything at E3, you have to wait in lines and like with Nintendo and stuff,

423
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,180
that's why there is a big rush to the Nintendo booth.

424
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,180
It's not because the people are excited about Nintendo stuff.

425
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,220
Sure, they're excited about that and everything else.

426
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:53,020
But Nintendo particularly had like three to five hour wait lines to see a game.

427
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,060
Like no thanks.

428
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,500
I would rather not waste three to five hours of my time to do that when I can just see

429
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,380
it in a video in a direct.

430
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,720
And there's like my 30 minutes of time that I spent watching those.

431
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,500
The worst is when you stand in line and then you realize what you're seeing got pushed

432
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,140
on YouTube that same night.

433
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,140
That's that.

434
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,900
That was the last E3 I went to.

435
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,660
And I think I've told that on the story before.

436
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,380
That was the moment when I was like, I'm wasting my fucking time.

437
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,340
It was just, it's, it's hard to like, even like going there, like it was hard to pay

438
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,340
attention.

439
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,500
Like if you're just not using the internet at that time and just going to E3 and trying

440
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,900
to pick up the information, it's hard to like get everything you're going to miss stuff

441
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
on there.

442
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,500
You're a miss seeing things because you didn't know what was going on because it's just a

443
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,980
chaotic mess.

444
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,580
I just can't, I can't imagine this is going to be very good.

445
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:52,180
I mean, whatever it, it'll be like E4 all, but like, I don't think people wanted that

446
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,140
to come back and it certainly didn't come back.

447
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,140
So I don't know.

448
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,140
All right.

449
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,100
Well, we'll, uh, we'll keep our eye on this new E3.

450
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,020
I mean, even though we're all kind of looking at this going meh, I mean, it is relevant

451
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,500
if they can get the big names to support the show and get those big announcements again,

452
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,540
it's going to be important.

453
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,900
So we'll keep our eye on it and see how things develop over the next few months.

454
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,400
But in the meantime, we'll focus on this month or this week and talk about our gaming weeks

455
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,460
and the types of games that we've been playing.

456
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,580
So Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?

457
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,760
How was your gaming week?

458
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,660
Playing Dead by Daylight and I'm still working on Survivor and indeed I will be playing again

459
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,460
with Finara later tonight.

460
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:43,220
Um, Finara has been my meat shield so that I can get, um, my adepts and, you know, get

461
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
better with the game.

462
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,940
And I'm already at gold four, gold four or gold three.

463
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:55,580
I don't remember, but, um, I also, I don't know what it is, but I think because I am

464
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:01,200
a killer main, I have a talent of making friends with the killers, the ones who are in the

465
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,760
mood to be friends.

466
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,280
Like I had a match where basically Finara and I were the only ones who really made it

467
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:23,160
out okay because we stopped to boop a pig and I've made friends with legions, which

468
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,720
you know, lesion players are notorious for being pretty toxic.

469
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,600
Um, I've, I've made, and I actually, I played a doctor match.

470
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,280
I actually did play a killer match because I wanted to just get the challenge done and

471
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,780
ended up just memeing around and met another streamer.

472
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
That was pretty fun.

473
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
Yeah.

474
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,840
I actually rated them after my stream.

475
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,200
So I've been, I've been getting a lot, I like Survivor better, a lot better than I thought

476
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
I would.

477
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,060
Um, cause the first like doing the demo, I hated it.

478
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,300
And then when I played with some other friends, I was like racked with nerves the whole time.

479
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,480
And the one thing that I do not like is that because I have to use the thumb track ball

480
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:09,980
mouse for having a bad wrist, um, I can't look behind me when I run, which also means

481
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,460
that I will not have any problem with them nerfing dead hard cause I don't use it.

482
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:27,940
I am however, not looking forward to adapting, uh, uh, David because no, yeah, however, um,

483
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,880
I, you know how if you do a certain generator in certain levels, you get an achievement

484
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
for it.

485
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
Yeah.

486
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
I have one left to go.

487
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
Oh, that's nice.

488
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
Which one?

489
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
I have, I have a Scrotus pen.

490
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
I mean, Crotus pen.

491
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
Okay.

492
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
I call it.

493
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
I call it Scrotus pen.

494
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Okay.

495
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Yeah.

496
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
The, the served ward.

497
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
I got the, the chapel.

498
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
Okay.

499
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,840
Honestly, if you got RPD, that's the biggest pain in the butt in my opinion.

500
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
So congrats.

501
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Yeah.

502
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,100
Um, I got with, uh, Nick and anti vortex and I forgot who else, but they were like, no,

503
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
you're getting this.

504
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,700
I, someone brought the offering and said, you're getting this.

505
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
And so I got it.

506
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Oh, that's fun.

507
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Yeah.

508
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,180
And, and the, the, the killer ended up, you know, pretty much letting us go anyway.

509
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,540
Um, so it was, it was all right.

510
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:22,900
You know, um, and I got, I think I do have almost everyone adept now.

511
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,600
I know this is all like dead by daylight stuff that not everyone cares about, but I have

512
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,440
Laurie, Ace, Adam, Ash, yeah.

513
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
And David.

514
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,180
Those are the ones I have left.

515
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,640
Of course, Nancy and Steve don't count.

516
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:49,640
Um, I also, um, I still couldn't get my final fantasy, uh, six translated uncensored version

517
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,580
to play in a battle.

518
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,960
Like it'll do everything except do the damn battle.

519
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Oh, weird.

520
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,560
So, uh, yeah, it's, and I think it's just the patch or, or my copy of it or something.

521
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,180
And I, and like I said, I feel absolutely justified playing it through emulation because

522
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,040
I own both copies of the game.

523
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Yeah.

524
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,100
I mean, I have a Japanese cartridge and I have an American cartridge.

525
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,780
How many times do you have to own a game before we stop apologizing for emulating?

526
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,780
Because it's convenient.

527
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm saying it because I'm streaming it.

528
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
No, no, no.

529
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,280
I mean, in general, I'm not attacking you.

530
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,380
I'm just saying in general, like the community, like, like emulation has to be acceptable

531
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,380
at some point.

532
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,400
Like, you know, you're just playing the stuff you own.

533
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Like I, yeah.

534
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Anyway.

535
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Yeah.

536
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:41,800
Um, um, but I, um, I suplexed to train on Wednesday and I did the opera last night and

537
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,820
I will be playing it again on Wednesday.

538
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,820
Nice.

539
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,960
So, but tonight is, is Debbie Thursday and Friday is dead by daylight.

540
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,980
And I'm actually really gonna try to get through the rest of those depths and try to get back

541
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,420
to killer a little bit later.

542
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,780
I think the thing that I like best is just that I've been playing with friends.

543
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,780
That's cool.

544
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,200
I, the life of the killer is a lonely life.

545
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,340
I would love to join you tonight, but I have a major, major work thing starting tomorrow.

546
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,520
So I got to get to bed on time.

547
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
So

548
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,640
All right.

549
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,620
But maybe this just during the week's going to be hard just because yeah, I have a major

550
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,620
work thing going on.

551
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,220
So it's all right.

552
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,220
But if you can, you can.

553
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
Maybe next Sunday.

554
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Yeah.

555
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,220
Maybe.

556
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,220
It depends how traffic is.

557
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,720
Cause I have to commute to another city this week.

558
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
So yeah.

559
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,460
Well, as Dan is fond of saying, real life must intrude.

560
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:40,480
Unfortunately, it is the way it goes, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

561
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,920
It's been a lot of video editing in Minecraft as usual, like three videos in a week.

562
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Right?

563
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Yeah.

564
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,960
So I had two videos out like last week and then I put one out in the beginning of this

565
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
week.

566
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,800
So, uh, the new bill I did was a guardian XP farm and the bottom of the farm is the

567
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,080
giant lantern fish from mega man too.

568
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,880
So I think, I think it came out really well.

569
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,240
Um, yeah, this next, I saw him come up with what I'm building for.

570
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,500
I mean, I have worked on stuff for, with the new frog lights.

571
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,760
So that's a thing that's in Minecraft now where do you bring frogs into the nether and

572
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:25,160
you break down magma cubes to the smallest little magma cube, they'll eat them and poop

573
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,520
out lights for reasons.

574
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
I don't know.

575
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,860
Um, so I have a farm that does that now and it's way too efficient.

576
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:39,220
So I, I keep cutting back the amount of space that's dedicated to the lights and just what

577
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,900
it's a normal magma cube farm.

578
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:47,660
And I have to now cut it down to a quarter because I literally have, Oh gosh, probably

579
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,820
20 double chests full of frog lights.

580
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,540
That's more than I'll ever need more than the server will ever need for the entire season

581
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,540
after like a night.

582
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:02,060
So it'll be, it'll be fun to figure out how I'm going to use those, but I need to come

583
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,060
up with some more magma and stuff.

584
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,940
I think this time that we have to make a shop to sell some things cause I have a bunch of

585
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,740
farms now and I need to probably start doing that.

586
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:16,180
We just went to the, uh, the deep dark and the ancient city today and that kind of didn't

587
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:24,180
go great, but we, we did some fun, like, uh, challenge things where we were basically stripped

588
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,300
down to like no armor or anything and we just decided, okay, we're just going to sprint

589
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,100
through this thing and see whoever dies the last.

590
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
And I died the last.

591
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,100
So I got, I got 50 diamonds out of that.

592
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Congratulations.

593
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,100
It was fun.

594
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
All right.

595
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Um, let's see.

596
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,780
My gaming week, uh, I also play a little dead by daylight, um, kind of focusing on killer

597
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
this week.

598
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,940
I played a lot of, I'm really trying to get better with Sadako.

599
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,900
Um, and, uh, I find my matches just, they swing the pendulum either I get four Ks or

600
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
I get bullied.

601
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,300
Uh, it just was feast or famine.

602
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,300
Yeah.

603
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
It's, it's really just depends.

604
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,300
So I'm just trying to get better with her.

605
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,500
Uh, just trying to get better with chasing on like L wall T walls is really where I need

606
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
like the help.

607
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,600
Um, I've also been playing plague.

608
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,460
I kind of consider plague my other sort of main of the moment.

609
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,180
So, um, that's kind of fun.

610
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,420
I just like plague because I feel like she breaks the normal survivor meta.

611
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,260
Like dead hard doesn't matter with her really.

612
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
Yeah.

613
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,100
So cause you can just puke on them.

614
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,100
Exactly.

615
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,040
Cause uh, that distance doesn't give you anything.

616
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,860
So yeah, you know, I used to be a plague main.

617
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,420
I, yeah, it's kind of where you started, wasn't it?

618
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:36,540
I started with Legion and then I was following Otz's, uh, like killer tier, you know, best

619
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,540
perk thing.

620
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,540
And then I finally realized, you know what, I don't really care about his opinion.

621
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
I mean, he's great streamer, great person.

622
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,020
I don't person's opinion.

623
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,020
Yeah.

624
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:50,340
But I did agree that starting off with plague really helped me because learning a hard killer

625
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:56,100
like that made learning pig a cinch.

626
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,620
I found that tall characters are harder for me to play than short characters.

627
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
Yeah.

628
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,620
Which is, and isn't that funny?

629
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,580
Like plague is very tall and Sudako is very short and that's where I kind of live right

630
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,580
now.

631
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,580
Sadako is the shortest one.

632
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,340
I think that comparatively she's like four, no, she's like right at five foot I want to

633
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,700
say or four, four, 10, five foot.

634
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,920
And pig is five, three, which is my height.

635
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,800
But the best thing ever with Sadako is that when you go to hook somebody and she kind

636
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,800
of, you know, she does all psychic powers, when she goes, the hook actually lowers so

637
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,840
that she can get them on the hook.

638
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,280
The hook actually bends down ever slightly during the whole animation.

639
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,320
The hook is like, I will bend to your will mistress.

640
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
Yes.

641
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,000
She's like, damn right, bend to my psychic powers.

642
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
It's her psychic powers.

643
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,860
So yeah.

644
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,360
Other games I've been playing, I've been continuing to play Diablo three and apparently there's

645
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,800
a group of like, I was reading a story on a website this week about how like there's

646
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,100
people that went and played Diablo immortal and then realized when Diablo immortals like

647
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,300
money making stuff was kind of BS.

648
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,360
They just went back and played Diablo three and were like, Oh, there's a lot of stuff

649
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
going on here.

650
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,020
I'm like, I am one of those people because they actually the latest season, they added

651
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,140
a new thing where there's like a whole little bonus room that was kind of fun to play.

652
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,200
And I guess the next season they're testing next week and they're, it's adding a new thing

653
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
too.

654
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,040
I kind of thought Diablo was done adding stuff, but they're still adding like little things,

655
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,320
which is great because Diablo three doesn't have microtransactions anymore.

656
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,080
We all know the real money auction house was a disaster, but that is like eight year old

657
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
news at this point.

658
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,440
That is a way in the past.

659
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,520
So this is a, the game's in a good place now and I'm having fun.

660
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,920
Alan got back into it too.

661
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:42,640
So I was helping him level his seasonal and then he got help from strangers online.

662
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,740
He's like double my paragon level right now.

663
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,560
He's like paragon four 70 or something and I'm like 200 maybe.

664
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,360
So yeah, it's kind of, kind of fun.

665
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,800
And then also continuing my GPS games, I hit level 61 in Pikmin and then I haven't really

666
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
been playing that.

667
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,600
There's a Pokemon event that happened this weekend, but I've only like half been half

668
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
paying attention.

669
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,800
I don't like the battling stuff.

670
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,600
I don't really care for the team rocket battles and that stuff.

671
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,980
I'll do them if I have to, but I've just kind of been ignoring this event.

672
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,520
So but I just want to make sure I catch all the Pokemon.

673
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,320
So I got Pansear who's like a regional who's kind of available right now.

674
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Yeah.

675
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,800
So just try to, try to get the rest of the candy I need to evolve that one and then I'll

676
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,040
feel better about where that's at.

677
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,680
Otherwise one other games that I've been playing, which is random, but it came out on Xbox game

678
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,720
pass, which I also think is random and it's on game pass for PC and Xbox series, but I've

679
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,440
been playing on PC DJ Max respect.

680
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:49,280
So V, which is fun and it's funny because I own it on steam too, but remember I got

681
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,560
a new computer, so I never installed it on this computer.

682
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,320
So I was like, ah, what the hell?

683
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,200
I'll install the game pass version to get some achievements, but the only thing that

684
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,400
sucks is none of my DLC, cause I don't think the Xbox version has the DLC implemented yet.

685
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,200
Whereas the steam version has like classical and some of the stuff I really like.

686
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,800
So it's sorry to say, but the steam version is a little bit better.

687
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I think still cause it has the DLC available.

688
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,880
I don't know if they're planning on adding that to Xbox, but probably won't be on game

689
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
pass anyway.

690
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,000
Uh, it's probably how they kind of hook you in.

691
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,640
So, um, Mike depth and chat says DJ max respect V on Xbox is pretty much the same as the PC

692
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,280
version for better and for worse.

693
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
Yeah.

694
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,240
So it's, it's pretty much the same thing just in the windows store and a series X, but yes,

695
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,000
I've been getting some achievements there and it's, it's kind of scratching the 2d X

696
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,080
itch because do you remember how round one was supposed to open here in, um, Roseville

697
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,360
in June?

698
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,680
Yeah, we were lied to.

699
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,960
So apparently according to Reddit and somebody who called now it's like late August, they've

700
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,800
been pushing that lied to, but they've been pushing that back every single time.

701
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,080
But I mean, I understand the first time cause of COVID, but they had, was it cause I'm in,

702
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,160
um, I was in the old Sean against group now it's like sack gamers or something like that.

703
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,220
And they had, someone had posted a picture from today, I think where like the game machines

704
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:20,080
are on, like some of them are on, I don't know what they're doing right now, but I mean,

705
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,480
it should be opening and I hope pretty soon.

706
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Hmm.

707
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,960
Well, we'll see.

708
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,080
It wasn't, I went by the mall last week and it still wasn't open, but, and I'm sure when

709
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,920
it opens, we'll hear everything.

710
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,680
Does that, is that the same group that had all the games that strikes in Rockland?

711
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,680
Are they all still there?

712
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,440
I haven't been to strikes since the pandemic.

713
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,620
Yeah, they had stuff there and I think at the drive-in as well, and then of course that

714
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,620
burned down.

715
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,060
Um, but yeah, I think they had them at strikes.

716
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,560
I think that stuff's still there.

717
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Interesting.

718
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,240
I just haven't been over there since the pandemic started.

719
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
So just curious.

720
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
All right.

721
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,600
Um, Oh, that's fine.

722
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
I didn't realize this.

723
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,200
Mike Defton chat says I'm playing the Xbox version of DJ Max respect and the freaking

724
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,940
game still tells you press F 12 for X.

725
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,580
And I'm like, I'm on an Xbox.

726
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,580
God damn it.

727
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,720
I, that's this type of stuff I thought they're supposed to find in certification.

728
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,820
That's what the cert process is supposed to find.

729
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,140
So that one must've got missed.

730
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,140
That's interesting.

731
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
So, Hmm.

732
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,140
All right.

733
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,840
Um, that's it for our gaming weeks.

734
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,180
Let's get into some more gaming news and what else is going on around the industry.

735
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,700
There's been, there's been some stories this week, so we'll start with Loki and a franchise

736
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,260
near and dear to his heart.

737
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
Yeah.

738
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,220
What used to be guaranteed.

739
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,260
It's still near and dear to my heart.

740
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,980
Um, it's so dear to your heart.

741
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,580
It just keeps breaking it.

742
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,580
Yeah.

743
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,100
Oh, so Rockstar basically confirmed a lot of things that we kind of already assumed

744
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,340
with their actions.

745
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,100
I mean, that's just kind of the way they've been treating things.

746
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:52,780
So they've confirmed that, um, major red dead online or red dead online support is done.

747
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,380
I mean, let's be honest, it's been done for months already.

748
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,180
They haven't really supported it at all because their cash cow grand theft auto online is

749
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,420
been making a ton of money and that's where they're putting their effort.

750
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,500
So they said, you know, over the past few years, we've steadily moving towards development

751
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,380
resources towards the entry of the next entry in the grand theft auto series.

752
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,660
Understanding that, um, more than ever, the need to exceed players expectations for this

753
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,940
next century can be the best as possibly can be.

754
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,420
Um, and as a result, we are in the process of making some changes in how we support red

755
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,420
dead online.

756
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,780
Let's be honest, like they haven't like provided updates to red dead online for like a long

757
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:37,300
time and it's certainly not supported the same way as grand theft auto online.

758
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,900
So sure, we'll just say that they're doing that.

759
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,340
Um, and then of course they're also shelving some other remakes.

760
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:50,780
So this one really is super disappointing for me because I was a huge fan of grand theft

761
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
auto four.

762
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,500
Uh, it's where I played all my modded games and stuff.

763
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,980
They were going to do a remaster grand theft auto four and of the original red dead redemption.

764
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:06,940
But they said that, um, allegedly do the insider sources that these are no longer on the table,

765
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:13,660
uh, because of the mess that grand theft auto, um, the trilogy went through.

766
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,940
I mean, but are they surprised?

767
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:22,300
I mean, like they didn't put a lot of effort into the trilogy and they're surprised that

768
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,620
it like blew up at them.

769
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,100
Like, I mean, they're really going to put the same amount of effort and let's have like,

770
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,980
I was going to ask if the four remake was in the same boat as the trilogy, it probably

771
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,180
would have pissed you off.

772
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
You wouldn't have been happy.

773
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,540
Oh, it would have absolutely pissed me off.

774
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:41,820
But like I still would have liked to see a re oh, I'd like to see a remake of that.

775
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,020
It would be nice, but I just, if they're not going to put any effort into it, which I don't

776
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,440
understand why they have the resources, they make so many billions of dollars off of grand

777
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
theft auto.

778
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,600
I mean, five has been out forever.

779
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,000
I don't understand why they couldn't do that, but all right.

780
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,740
I mean, if you really don't want to put the effort behind it, then I guess it's better

781
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,740
not to come out.

782
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,680
Fifth dream in chat says grand theft auto six will never meet gamers expectations.

783
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,920
Do you think the bar is too high for GTA six?

784
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,760
Um, yeah, it is.

785
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,680
I think it's, it's never going to, I think, I think the problem with GTA six and I don't

786
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,360
even play these games as much as you do.

787
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,900
And I fully admit that Loki, but I think the problem with GTA six is going to be the pressure

788
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,640
to make something that continues the online side of things.

789
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,940
Because like you said, that's where they're raking in the billions.

790
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,180
That is what's going to happen.

791
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:40,960
So here's what I see with GTA six is like, it'll never single player wise, it's never

792
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,500
going to live up to it because it's it going from like four to five, it was just such a

793
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,540
massive like the world was so much bigger and so much more in depth and stuff.

794
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,540
You just can't, you can't really go much further with it.

795
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,980
Like you can't make it even more in depth and larger.

796
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:05,600
I don't know how big of a world they can really make with that kind of detail.

797
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,740
It would have been nice.

798
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,520
The thought was originally with grand theft auto six that was going to be a different

799
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,500
location and that that would somehow tie into grand theft auto online or that grand theft

800
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,820
auto online would keep expanding to like, you know, we'd go to Liberty City and we would

801
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:26,100
go to Vice City and then maybe new locations that they'd never come up with and you have

802
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,760
it where you that would all kind of interconnect together.

803
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,340
But I don't know, I'll still play it.

804
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:41,260
But it's, it's gonna be like micro transaction to hell, you know, for grant, whatever grand

805
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:47,580
theft auto online to is it's going to be just an absolute slog as far as pushing those

806
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,740
micro transactions, because that's where they made so much money.

807
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,980
I mean, the people have voted with their wallets, so

808
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,460
Zen monkey 11 says GTA six will be epic.

809
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,420
Rockstar always comes through, you know, let's, let's, let's, it'd be nice to see something.

810
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,420
That's all it's been.

811
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
It's been a while.

812
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,420
It's been a while.

813
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
Yeah.

814
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,420
Like, let's put it this way.

815
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,420
Like the single player probably is going to be good.

816
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,540
Like because Red Dead Redemption two was a great single player experience.

817
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,520
I just like I'm still disappointed that five never had any single player DLC like as four

818
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,700
had two really great pieces of single player DLC that were, it really fit that game.

819
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,820
Like I would love to see something like that, but I don't know.

820
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,820
We'll see.

821
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:37,560
SGA 100 Matt in chat says GTA blockchain confirmed.

822
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
Please know.

823
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
I don't think so.

824
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,100
But like, you're not.

825
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,620
Please do not.

826
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,700
Let's move on and talk because I don't, I don't know if crypto is treating this company

827
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:54,060
very well, but there's, unfortunately, I think what a lot of us knew was probably gonna happen

828
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,540
eventually started to happen over at GameStop and, but, but I mean, I'm going to start off

829
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,540
with this.

830
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,660
An executive gets laid off.

831
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:08,820
So the chief financial officer of GameStop, Mike Recupero has been fired.

832
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,860
And along with that, some mass layoffs.

833
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:17,500
An email that went out from CEO Matt Furlong said that these reductions are to help the

834
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:24,920
company operate more nimbly while they pursue profitability through an intense owner's mentality.

835
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,580
I'm not sure totally what that means.

836
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:31,140
I'm assuming it's gaming culture and how you walk into GameStop now and it's like Funko

837
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,400
Pops shirt, things like that.

838
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,020
It's not just games like it used to be.

839
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:41,180
The first line of the email read, change will be a constant as we evolve our commerce business

840
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,660
and launch new products through our blockchain group.

841
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,660
Sorry.

842
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,660
Sorry.

843
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:52,420
It's so sad to see them like pivoting towards this considering what's going on in the crypto

844
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,420
space.

845
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,900
I was like, dude, do you not read the internet?

846
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,900
Do you not?

847
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,900
Do you not have phones?

848
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,900
Like what?

849
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,900
All right.

850
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,900
Yeah.

851
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,900
I'm sure.

852
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:08,660
I'm sure you'll be different, but while the layoffs seem to be mostly focused at the headquarters

853
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,960
in Texas, it's important to point out that some of the staff at Game Informer, which

854
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,860
of course is the magazine that's been around forever from GameStop, I'm surprised that's

855
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,860
still around.

856
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,860
Yeah.

857
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,180
But unfortunately, uh, the, some of that staff was laid off as well.

858
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,580
So who knows what that means for the future of the magazine?

859
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:29,740
Um, and that's always sad because, you know, I think a lot of us old timers sit there and

860
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:33,080
go, damn magazines used to be so cool.

861
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,140
And then we just, oh, you want to hire us.

862
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,580
Another one, another one.

863
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,660
I went, I went to a Barnes and Noble the other day.

864
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,660
Oh no.

865
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,900
And I walked over, I walked over.

866
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,900
Yeah.

867
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,900
Yeah.

868
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,900
They still exist.

869
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,900
Uh, they closed super early now.

870
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,700
Um, but I went over to, uh, the magazine section.

871
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,420
I was like, oh, I'm gonna like for gaming magazines.

872
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,420
Yep.

873
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,420
They weren't there.

874
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,860
They had, I think it may have like a retro magazine or something like that, the one import

875
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:04,240
from Europe, like a retro magazine from Europe, I think it's like, I thought that retro gamer

876
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,240
was over.

877
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,500
Oh, I used to get that.

878
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,700
Maybe it wasn't necessarily a retro gamer.

879
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,460
Like a lot of them aren't necessarily magazines like issue magazines.

880
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:18,220
A lot of them will do like, it's a retro gaming spectacular magazine where it like just covers

881
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,220
like retro games.

882
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,420
And it's like a one-off type thing.

883
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,740
So they'll have those.

884
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,020
Um, I did find it funny though that 2,600 still has a magazine coming out.

885
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,020
That's that's funny.

886
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:35,940
Um, but yeah, no, it was sad to see like no gaming magazines anymore.

887
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,100
So it is what it is.

888
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Uh, interesting.

889
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,980
Bobby is talking about, uh, his trip to Minneapolis for summer games done quick and some of the

890
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,260
sightseeing around there.

891
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,780
Bobby in our chat says, when I visited the museum of consumerism in Minneapolis, better

892
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:56,540
known as the mall of America, uh, the GameStop was actually called GameStop pop culture.

893
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:05,780
So is that pop culture as in Funko pop culture, when's the, when's the dam going to burst

894
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,780
on those things?

895
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,540
Like, I feel like those things are everywhere and they're not going, you know, it's the

896
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,860
beanie babies that won't go away.

897
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,860
I guess so.

898
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,860
And look, I, before you all labeled me a hater, I'm not a hater.

899
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,140
Look, I have pop, I'm not going to reach up there, but I have pop figures that are

900
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,140
way up here.

901
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:25,260
I have my Mass Effect Andromeda ones up here, uh, uh, Sarah Ryder and Liam Costa are up

902
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,260
there.

903
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:33,140
Um, but like, so I, yeah, I do have some, but I, I still can't, my God, they're everywhere,

904
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,140
everywhere.

905
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,980
And actually, do you know what's in my office?

906
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,600
Do you know what's way cooler than any Funko pop I own?

907
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,400
The Spice Girls Legos I just got on my last trip to the Galleria last week.

908
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,400
Yeah, that's right.

909
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,400
I forgot those are coming out.

910
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,660
The Spice Girls Legos.

911
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,760
I I'm going to have to do this next week is, is too much for me at work to do it, but I

912
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,200
think maybe in two weeks I'll do a creative stream and I'll build those on stream.

913
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,480
I think that'll be fun.

914
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,400
So I'll tell you what I want, whatever they want.

915
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,760
It's more Spice Girls Legos.

916
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
That's for sure.

917
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,200
Actually, there's so many cool like Lego stuff now.

918
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:16,200
Like damn, like, like between the, cause when I was in the store, um, they had a Sonic

919
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,400
stuff.

920
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,800
They had all the Mario stuff.

921
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,040
I know there's a story coming up later on that Mario stuff.

922
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,480
I won't spoil it, but I think y'all know what I'm talking about.

923
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,480
There's that.

924
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,000
Like there's a lot of cool ass Lego stuff right now.

925
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,680
They keep, I keep seeing the question block and I'm like, yeah, it's so expensive.

926
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,980
I don't, I don't need it.

927
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,360
And I also see, I keep seeing the Queer Eye set.

928
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,000
I just don't like the television.

929
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Oh yeah.

930
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Queer Eye set.

931
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It's um, they have that.

932
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,360
They have, they have a bunch of like TV shows.

933
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:49,880
They have Seinfeld, Friends, they had two Friends sets, uh, Queer Eye and well, way

934
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:56,300
back they had, uh, the big bang, big bang theory, but, um, yeah, there's a lot of sets

935
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,800
or I look every week, but like all the time I'm like, nope, nope.

936
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
I don't need that.

937
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,440
We never got our drag race Lego set even though it got the voting thing.

938
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,080
But anyway, yeah, it's licensing.

939
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,840
Well, they need to figure it out cause we need drag race.

940
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,880
Like, come on, we need the work room in a Lego set.

941
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,160
Come on.

942
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,160
They have a new one though.

943
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:22,660
That not Lego necessarily, but uh, Mega constructs has a new Pikachu that actually is, it has

944
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,360
a crank and it does the animation of running.

945
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,860
I was just saying, are they the Lego clone that have the Pokemon license?

946
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,860
Because we were all, they are.

947
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,860
Yeah.

948
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:36,380
I haven't, I hadn't been to the mall in a while and there's a lot of like, like Japanese

949
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,820
import type of stores now between like Daiso, Miniso and like other, like there were at

950
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,420
least two or three other like collectible stores like that, but they had a ton of like

951
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,420
Pokemon really.

952
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,420
I sent Shane a picture.

953
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,900
I was like, did you know these exist?

954
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:52,820
So I need to go to Miniso cause I've actually gotten really good storage saver stuff from

955
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,820
their site online.

956
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,820
Oh yeah.

957
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,460
Mega constructs also had Halo.

958
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,700
They also had destiny.

959
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,740
In fact, I still have a destiny.

960
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,620
It's like, I don't know what they call them.

961
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:09,620
I know in Lego terms, it's the, um, Oh gosh, it's the block heads.

962
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,640
It's like blocks on the, I don't know.

963
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,480
It's a little like kind of the Funko pop version of Lego characters.

964
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,480
I don't remember.

965
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,480
They call brickheads.

966
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,480
That's right.

967
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,260
And um, so whatever the mega constructs equivalent of that would be for destiny, I have one of

968
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,260
those.

969
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,380
Um, it was, these were all stuff.

970
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,380
I got it.

971
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:38,740
Um, but yeah, they have a lot of unique licenses.

972
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,420
Hot Wheels is one that they have right now.

973
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:45,020
They have like hot, big old Hot Wheels cars you can make, um, I don't know.

974
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,020
Very exciting stuff.

975
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,020
Yeah.

976
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:51,280
Anyway, my advice to GameStop, uh, more spice girls, less crypto, but as long as you keep

977
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:58,100
marching to this crypto thing, like rip, honestly, so, all right, moving on, uh, things to look

978
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:02,140
forward to Dark Sakura.

979
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:06,220
And those among those things is a game that's being remade.

980
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,820
And yes, everyone's like, yay, more remakes.

981
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:14,500
This one was a, I don't know, kind of a sleeper at first, a lollipop chainsaw.

982
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:20,340
There is going to be a rerelease for this in, uh, 2023.

983
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:28,180
It will have, uh, more, um, it actually is going to employ some of the previous staff

984
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:34,780
that worked on it and some newer staff and have quote more realistic and quote visuals.

985
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:39,540
It will have a new soundtrack because of licensing issues.

986
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:50,220
The big thing before that, um, is that, uh, there's a, uh, a quote on here from, uh, Yasuda

987
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:54,380
Yoshimi, who was the original games producer.

988
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:59,660
Um, unfortunately, various factors resulted in things making it so that fans can no longer

989
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,800
easily play lollipop chainsaw.

990
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,960
And it has been sometime since players have not been able to access the game on current

991
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,960
consoles.

992
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:15,560
In fact, this is absent, uh, from the Xbox backward compatibility list.

993
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,880
Um, the theory is it because of the music.

994
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:24,360
Um, so to continue the quote, um, we, the original development staff on lollipop chainsaw,

995
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,320
think of the game as very precious to us and did, and did not want to leave it in limbo

996
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,920
where players who want to play it cannot.

997
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,280
As such, we purchased the lollipop chainsaw intellectual properties from, uh, Kadokawa

998
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,600
games and decided to develop a remake.

999
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:47,480
Our goal is to make it easier for game, for games who want to play, I guess it means gamers

1000
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,280
who want to play lollipop chainsaw to do so.

1001
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,120
Please look forward to the games 2023 release.

1002
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:59,440
So basically, uh, you play a underdressed cheerleader with her boyfriend's head attached

1003
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,800
to her waist who kills somehow.

1004
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,800
Yeah.

1005
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:10,360
They're alive somehow and you chop them up.

1006
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,800
It's weird.

1007
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,080
As you should do to ex boyfriends.

1008
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,840
Very mixed reviews on this game.

1009
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,840
Yeah.

1010
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
No, it wasn't her ex.

1011
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,280
I think he was just like her love interest.

1012
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,280
Oh, interesting.

1013
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,280
Oh, okay.

1014
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,280
Hmm.

1015
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Yeah.

1016
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,840
I have to admit, I didn't really spend any time with it, but, um, I know it's kind of

1017
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,720
a, uh, I guess cult classic could be the word thing you call it.

1018
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,720
Yeah.

1019
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,720
So, all right.

1020
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,000
I'll, I'll have to see what this remakes all about when the trailer, uh, comes out.

1021
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Watch a play through of the game at some point.

1022
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,040
You will just go, what did I watch?

1023
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,040
What?

1024
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,920
Uh, as soon as you went to Matt and chat says, yeah, James Gunn and Suda 51 said they only

1025
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,280
found out about this a few weeks ago as these remake things tend to go sometimes.

1026
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,560
Uh, and that's true of Hollywood as well as, you know, video games clearly.

1027
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:02,680
So all right, well, uh, what is a new console that we won't be playing?

1028
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,440
We won't be playing this remake on Loki.

1029
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,240
So it's the newest scam console, the polium, a polium one.

1030
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:16,640
It is bringing all of your favorite things in the gaming industry together.

1031
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:23,680
Web 3.0 NFTs, the blockchain, and it's going to do amazing things like throw out specs

1032
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,720
that it can't possibly hit.

1033
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:32,440
It's going to be eight K, 120 FPS and ray tracing and it's going to, it's going to include

1034
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,440
touch ID, which is somehow that's wholly owned by Apple.

1035
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,520
So I don't know how that's possible, but it's, it's going to combine your wallets and it's

1036
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:46,840
like somebody literally wrote every buzzword on a whiteboard and then said, okay, now put

1037
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,840
that in a press release to raise funds.

1038
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,140
Basically, yeah.

1039
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:58,200
So they have like a roadmap and there's a bunch of other nonsense with it.

1040
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:03,020
You have to buy, it's basically an elaborate rug pull is what it is because you have to

1041
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:07,160
buy an NFT to like purchase the console.

1042
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,120
But what's going to happen is you're going to buy all these NFTs and then they're going

1043
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,340
to rug pull it and then you're stuck with NFTs that are worth nothing.

1044
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,880
So keep it up.

1045
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,920
But not only that, they came up with a very unoriginal logo, which sort of looks like

1046
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,540
the GameCube logo.

1047
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:31,860
It also ends up looking like logos for Pebble Host, which is a hosting company for the Minecraft

1048
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,580
server I play on.

1049
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,780
Exactly the same logo.

1050
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,220
So yeah, just don't trust it.

1051
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:46,140
It is, it is the 2022 Phantom or Amico, however you want to put that.

1052
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:50,940
Well, I was going to say, which of these consoles are we more likely to see this web three console

1053
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,380
or the Amico?

1054
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,380
At this point?

1055
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,780
You know, at this point, a console for me would be the one that's most likely to come

1056
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:04,420
out is honestly like, I don't know.

1057
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,260
I don't think any of this stuff's coming out.

1058
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:12,340
There's only one way why YR could truly up his game.

1059
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,340
Game console?

1060
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,340
No.

1061
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,300
Then we don't need a game console, especially like the stuff with the web three stuff that

1062
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,300
they're talking about.

1063
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,300
So what's it going to do?

1064
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,460
It's going to run like HTML five games.

1065
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,980
Like, why do I need a console for that?

1066
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,460
Just do that through a PC.

1067
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,460
Do that through your phone.

1068
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,340
Like, why do I need a console for that?

1069
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,540
What games are going to be on?

1070
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,780
Oh, we're talking with people about getting games.

1071
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,460
No, no, thank you.

1072
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,460
Don't need.

1073
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,900
Yeah, I have.

1074
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,140
I will say this until I'm blue in the face.

1075
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:51,060
Crypto games are going to be gar, budge, garbage until they ever are able to partner into an

1076
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,260
existing franchise.

1077
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,260
That is big.

1078
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,260
Like I said, Pokemon.

1079
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,600
You want to make NFTs popular?

1080
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,940
Do you want people to talk about NFTs?

1081
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,780
Do you want everybody to go fucking crazy about NFTs?

1082
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,180
Get the Pokemon company on board until that happens.

1083
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:07,100
It's it's like shovelware games are the types of games.

1084
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,100
NFTs anyway.

1085
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,100
Yeah.

1086
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,020
So it's just, yeah.

1087
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,900
Stop trying to make NFTs happen.

1088
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,900
It's not happening.

1089
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,060
And it just blows my mind again.

1090
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,660
Again, it goes back to the ape NFT things where I'm like, what?

1091
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:22,980
Why are that?

1092
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,780
Why is that what you're trying to sell me NFTs with?

1093
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,300
I mean, yikes.

1094
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:34,740
Anyway, if you're going to make an NFT, make it pretty.

1095
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,620
Questmaster in chat says, what titles are slated for this?

1096
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,780
Repeats blockchain variants that can be built into games.

1097
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,780
No, no, no.

1098
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,140
Games can I look forward to?

1099
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,140
It's not it's not there.

1100
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,140
It's not there.

1101
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,860
It's not there.

1102
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,860
That's funny.

1103
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,860
They say games.

1104
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:53,740
I mean, because it's it's about it's about blockchain and the crypto and you know who

1105
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,740
get in bed on with this.

1106
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:01,060
It's a company that's just real ready to jump into the whole crypto space.

1107
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,740
And they're looking for a new game console.

1108
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,740
That'd be GameStop.

1109
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,380
I was gonna say GameStop is going to back this.

1110
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,060
There's saving grace.

1111
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,060
It's going to happen.

1112
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,060
Yeah.

1113
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,940
Just like being extra failure.

1114
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,740
No, you insert Funko Pops in order to power the console.

1115
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:23,200
It just it shreds Funko Pops and feeds off their souls.

1116
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,200
That's where you're wrong.

1117
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,380
There's no souls in Funko Pops.

1118
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:35,460
All right, moving on to a console that might get a little more love to help it play games

1119
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,660
from an older console.

1120
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:41,180
It's the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 3 emulation.

1121
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:45,820
And you might be saying, but Rob, the PlayStation 5 can already play PlayStation 3 games, but

1122
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,540
only through the cloud.

1123
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:54,840
That is how the the PlayStation Plus service and its new like, you know, old games library.

1124
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,840
That's how it works.

1125
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,260
It's all through the cloud for PS3, for PS1 and 2, you can download them, but for PS3,

1126
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,260
it's all through the cloud.

1127
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:08,100
However, apparently the eagle eyed folks over on the Reset Era forums found a new job

1128
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:14,180
ad that is suggesting that Sony is getting an engineer to get PlayStation 3 emulation

1129
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,840
existing on the PlayStation 5.

1130
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:22,820
From the job posting said our software development engineer position works on the tools and technology

1131
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:28,800
team at PlayStation Studios to support the newly relaunched classics for PS4 and PS5.

1132
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,160
Classic games run via emulation of legacy PlayStation platforms.

1133
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,620
As a classics engineer, you would work closely with a group of other engineers, producers

1134
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:42,200
and QA teams to fix bugs, add new features and develop new emulators.

1135
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:47,720
That's the part that's getting everybody up in arms because what's the only emulator they

1136
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,700
still need a PlayStation 3 one.

1137
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:55,620
So because it's not like this thing is going to emulate Super Nintendo.

1138
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,780
I mean, that would be cool, but I mean, it takes a lot of that's literally the only other

1139
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,740
system that Sony has.

1140
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:08,140
I can't think of any other systems that they would need to emulate on the PlayStation.

1141
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:12,580
The PSP data, the PSP must be the Vita.

1142
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,580
What's that?

1143
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:17,180
I don't think Sony knows what a Vita is now.

1144
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:22,480
They clearly don't know they they they've tried to erase that from history and all of

1145
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,480
our memories.

1146
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,240
It's all about the back touch panel, because that's where we need the touch panel to be

1147
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,400
on the backside of a console.

1148
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:40,520
Um, let's see, um, in chat, Zen Monkey says, Please don't ruin the PS5 with PS3 nonsense.

1149
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:45,160
Not seeing how that I mean, an extra feature is not going to take away from any existing

1150
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,160
feature.

1151
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,680
So I'd be curious about that.

1152
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,400
I don't understand any logic in that, sorry.

1153
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,920
And victoryman chat says, ahem, we need Vita.

1154
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,160
Yeah, we do need Vita.

1155
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,160
That's for sure.

1156
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,240
Orange Wright says PS mobile clearly.

1157
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,080
Oh, that's the one that's the one forgot about.

1158
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:08,520
But that would be good because if we get PlayStation mobile, then that means we could have pixel

1159
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,040
poops on the PlayStation five.

1160
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:18,440
Because that that was the Vita's like arm of that was the PS mobile stuff on the Vita

1161
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,440
shop, right?

1162
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:25,080
Yeah, that was the kind of like, you know, you can make your own you can self published on

1163
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,800
the PlayStation Store type thing.

1164
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,040
Yeah, I'll be curious to see what happens to that.

1165
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,560
All right, let's go to our next story.

1166
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,360
Oh, by the way, Zen Monkey did follow up with a comment saying resources spent on old crap

1167
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,240
slows down work on the new stuff.

1168
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,680
I do understand that whole there's only so many pieces of the pie to go around.

1169
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,240
But remember, this story is coming from a new job posting.

1170
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,880
So it is possible Sony is adding the resources to deal with this to not take away from

1171
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,560
anything else. I think that's worth considering.

1172
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,360
So but anyhow, let's shift gears here.

1173
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,040
This is kind of more of a special interest story, but I think this is neat.

1174
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:01,640
Dark Sakura.

1175
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:13,040
So, well, I think it's also kind of interesting that this is a government thing, but the

1176
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:20,400
State Department has been pushing for a diplomacy program for game design.

1177
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:29,160
So it did its first school last last month, that would be in June, 450 students from

1178
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:36,320
across U.S., Israel, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain did a 10 week program called the

1179
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:42,640
Game Exchange and completed a total of 170 new video games that were based off of the

1180
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,320
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

1181
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:53,000
So if you're unfamiliar with what those goals are, they're also called the Global Goals

1182
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:59,200
adopted by the UN in 2015 as a call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and

1183
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,080
ensure that by 2030, all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

1184
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,760
So there's many different things that that involves.

1185
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,520
But going back to this, basically the participants were in up to three video

1186
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:22,240
conference calls with their international compatriots there, and they were at a sister

1187
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,880
school that was in addition to seven or eight sessions.

1188
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,880
So a total between 20 to 25 hours among themselves.

1189
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:36,240
So the teachers also involved in that were paid to help navigate through the game

1190
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:44,920
development process. So the goal is to foster long term relations while teaching

1191
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,920
them how to make games.

1192
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,760
So the Game Exchange received a grant from the Stevens Initiative, which is funded by

1193
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,760
the U.S. State Department and the Bezos Family Foundation.

1194
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,840
Yeah, Bezos.

1195
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,200
That is Jackie Bezos, the president and co-founder of the Bezos Family Foundation, who

1196
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,040
is Jeff Bezos' mother, who also owns The Washington Post.

1197
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,000
At any rate, they want to double the number of students next year.

1198
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:22,640
They're still working on a quantitative analysis of the program, but they think that

1199
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,880
this is going to be a really good way to facilitate person to person diplomacy on

1200
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:33,480
issues like climate change, gender equity and food security, especially among the

1201
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:40,760
younger generation. The acting deputy assistant secretary for professional and

1202
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,480
cultural exchanges for the U.S.

1203
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:48,000
Department of State, that's Chris Minor, is quoted saying the virtual exchange is the

1204
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,880
beginning of what we hope to be a lasting relationship that moves beyond gaming.

1205
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,880
Students were really positive on it.

1206
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,040
They wanted more opportunities to interact with other students and go abroad during the

1207
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:12,600
program. And there's a couple of people like a 16-year-old who said that they'd never

1208
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,600
met someone outside of the country except from Canada.

1209
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:24,400
And she was interested in it because she had been a Fortnite player after the pandemic

1210
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,680
started and wanted to make her own games.

1211
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,280
But she said that she wasn't sure that the cross-cultural aspect was going to work.

1212
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:38,880
And then it changed when one of the Israeli students said, shit.

1213
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,640
And then they're like, oh, you talk like we do.

1214
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,080
All right, we're all we're all kids.

1215
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,200
We all kind of deal with the same stuff.

1216
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:53,200
And I don't know, just took one little thing, but everyone's like, yeah, we're on this

1217
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,000
same the same wavelength on here.

1218
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,760
So is this about diplomacy through video games or just diplomacy through bad words?

1219
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:09,440
I don't know, but it was the getting together and trying something new.

1220
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:15,720
But they also learned a lot about the background of game development and about the

1221
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,960
background of each other.

1222
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:25,960
One of one of the Israeli students was basically like he wanted to connect with

1223
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,120
American kids through gaming and sports and music.

1224
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,720
He said he's a fan of basketball.

1225
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:37,080
He was a fan of the Detroit Pistons and he knows the Kiss song, Detroit Rock City.

1226
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,480
And other than that, he didn't have any expectations about the Detroit students, but

1227
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,640
they worked together and had fun.

1228
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,480
I think that's good.

1229
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,680
Yeah, I think it's neat.

1230
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,920
You know, it's, you know, the thing that isn't so explicitly pointed out by this article

1231
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,680
is that video games are art and it's it's people bonding.

1232
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,920
And it's it's, you know, the world coming together through art and being able to speak

1233
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,160
that common language.

1234
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,520
And I think that's really neat.

1235
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:11,840
Well, actually, that is sort of mentioned in there is that they the big thing was they

1236
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:16,720
wanted to create the games and share the culture and that the culture was the bonding

1237
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:22,000
point and that that would help them build the friendships with other people in the world.

1238
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,360
Well, I mean, best of best of luck to them in their development efforts and so forth, I

1239
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,520
look forward to seeing, you know, what they what they all come up with when they put their

1240
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,160
heads together. So it's already happened.

1241
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,400
So we'll see what next year brings.

1242
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,560
Cool. All right.

1243
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,480
Let's move on, Loki.

1244
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,360
With a follow up of sorts.

1245
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:52,600
Yes. So you may remember that EA made some really stupid tweets the other week was the

1246
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,600
other week. Geez, I don't even know it anymore.

1247
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,440
It was June 30th.

1248
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,480
OK, so, yeah, I was about two weeks ago, a week and a half talking about single player

1249
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,560
games and how like there are there are 10, but only like playing single player games.

1250
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,680
And everyone's like, you've killed so many single player games, you jerks.

1251
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:17,760
And so apparently because of that, you know, devs are angry at them and it's also caused

1252
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:22,080
roundtable meetings with staff kind of saying, what the hell are you doing?

1253
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:29,440
Stupid. You know, basically they said the most agreed on idea was to take responsibility

1254
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,920
for it and apologize.

1255
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,640
However, instead, they decided to post, you know, roast.

1256
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:39,800
Well deserved. We'll take the L because playing single player games actually makes them an

1257
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,960
11. God, that's so cringe.

1258
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,320
Like, stop.

1259
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,960
Just don't pretend.

1260
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,440
Just say, you know what?

1261
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:51,120
Sorry. Yeah, we understand how you may have taken offense to that.

1262
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,080
I have done.

1263
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,080
Hello, fellow teenagers.

1264
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,400
I have better advice.

1265
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:55,800
Delete your account.

1266
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,640
That's my advice. Delete your account.

1267
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:05,360
They're saying that a lot of the folks that are running the EA like social network, they said

1268
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,960
they're I'm not I'm not or I'm 99 percent sure that the person who posted the tweet and their

1269
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,400
manager don't even know about single player games comment from a decade ago.

1270
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:22,080
It says also that the source of further sources are saying that the staff were in a Twitter

1271
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:28,320
account are all new and most of them aren't really game industry people and likely had no idea

1272
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:32,040
about EA's long, bad history with single player games.

1273
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:32,880
Congrats.

1274
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,200
You played yourself.

1275
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,480
I I don't even know what else to say like that.

1276
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,360
Just what a bad fucking decision from the very top that was.

1277
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:47,880
And I that's stop trying to place the blame on somebody who is trying to come in and do their

1278
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:52,000
job. You know, you wanted to hire somebody new with not a lot of gaming background because they

1279
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,600
were cheap. Who is would hop on these trends?

1280
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,840
You know what? They did what they were asked to do.

1281
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:03,160
You made the mistake of and did I hear that they were like naughty, like they were an outsource

1282
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,200
company potentially, too. They weren't even EA employees.

1283
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,240
I don't even know. But like, like, why even tweet that in the first place?

1284
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:15,520
There are 10, but they only like playing it was a stupid Twitter trend that was going on.

1285
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,680
I understand that.

1286
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:20,840
But like, do we need corporations to get in on Twitter trends?

1287
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:27,760
Really ask RadioShack or RadioShack isn't really RadioShack anymore.

1288
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,520
Wendy's.

1289
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,520
I'll give you Wendy's.

1290
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,120
But yeah.

1291
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:31,440
Okay.

1292
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,400
DJ Rama says it was an outsize company.

1293
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:39,640
That's again, like I said, it's completely then you played yourself and these executives got

1294
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,920
exactly what they deserved.

1295
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,080
Period.

1296
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,720
Have some good advice to them.

1297
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,120
Don't delete your account.

1298
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,640
That's my advice.

1299
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,680
Just just don't don't do anything.

1300
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,200
Just let it don't even delete it.

1301
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,400
Just let it sit fallow.

1302
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,080
Let it decompose.

1303
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,520
I don't know. Just don't don't anymore.

1304
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:08,200
As Joe 100 Matt says, if it was a third party contractor sending this out, shouldn't you as the

1305
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,000
company approved said copy?

1306
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,600
A very, very excellent point.

1307
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,600
Not if they don't care.

1308
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,360
That's what we hired them for.

1309
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,240
Let them do it.

1310
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,120
Yeah.

1311
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:22,560
All right.

1312
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,840
This is our next story.

1313
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,920
This is some people's worst nightmare when it comes to digital content.

1314
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,600
And it's just coming true.

1315
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,480
And this has to do with PlayStation.

1316
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,600
But I will stress this is not in the US.

1317
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,320
This is happening overseas.

1318
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:46,240
It's the German and Austrian versions of PSN have lost movies from Studio Canal or I should say

1319
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,920
they will be removed on August 31st.

1320
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,120
But here's the thing.

1321
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:56,200
It doesn't just apply to 100 films that were available for purchase on the PlayStation Store.

1322
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:03,440
But if you previously purchased this, you can no longer access the film after August 31st.

1323
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,760
And there's a lot of like big movies that are a part of this.

1324
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:14,320
If I were to actually go to a list of all of them, all dogs go to heaven.

1325
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,280
Well, your PlayStation is not going.

1326
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,720
Oh, the Blair Witch.

1327
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:18,600
Wow.

1328
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:19,720
Let's see.

1329
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:24,200
It was because I see the picture on this site is this is Spinal Tap.

1330
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:31,480
So but, you know, all of the Hunger Games are in there and so on and so on.

1331
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,520
There's a lot of movies that are affected by this.

1332
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:40,200
Yeah, this is kind of crappy because this is why people don't want to buy their stuff digitally.

1333
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,400
I'm not sure.

1334
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,280
I mean, again, this is in Germany, Austria, so it doesn't affect the US.

1335
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,160
But I'm sitting here going, how is this legal?

1336
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,360
Like, aren't they just asking to get sued over this?

1337
01:12:52,560 --> 01:13:02,480
The consumer doesn't give a fuck about the licensing, but they're going to say, like, I paid for something and you took it away and you didn't give a refund because we haven't heard anything about refunds yet.

1338
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,640
So it's yeah.

1339
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:12,280
So anyway, we're only talking about a certain type of content in two countries, but it's still a precedent.

1340
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,640
I mean, it's two countries.

1341
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,360
It's no small, you know, thing.

1342
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:22,760
But it's still like, hey, why is the publisher allowed to even remove access in the first place?

1343
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,400
And I think this is going to get ugly.

1344
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,240
And I know you shouldn't read that.

1345
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,080
I wonder what's in the user agreement.

1346
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,280
You know, it's funny, I shouldn't read the comments, but I'm going to.

1347
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,960
And there's actually a meme here.

1348
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,400
Hold on. I'm going to show this on stream because it's just too funny.

1349
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,960
But on this site that I'm looking at here, it has this meme.

1350
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,080
You can always pirate digital media.

1351
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,200
It's always morally correct.

1352
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:57,880
And that you know what, as as much as that's a meme and stuff, I think that is exactly where a lot of people are going to go.

1353
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,280
With this, for sure.

1354
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,640
Yeah, no.

1355
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:08,240
DJ Rama S in chat says, remember, you only own a license to view the material, not own it.

1356
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:14,000
I still think when you tick off the user base and there's lawsuits, but again, I can't profess to sit here and

1357
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,840
go, I know what the recourse is in Germany and Austria.

1358
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:26,760
But I also now go, you know what, when people are like, hell, no, I don't want a digital PlayStation 5 or no, I don't want my games digitally.

1359
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,400
I still want games on disk.

1360
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,080
Can you blame them when you see a story like this?

1361
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,560
Can you blame people that want to go that route?

1362
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,280
Because I sure don't.

1363
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,320
So anyway.

1364
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:42,720
Let's take a trip back to a time when there wasn't digital only versions of stuff.

1365
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,600
Digital was only possible through a 9600 baud modem in our next segment.

1366
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:05,440
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1367
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,560
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1368
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,760
And what did you pick for the game this week, Dark Sakura?

1369
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,200
Ikaruga.

1370
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,640
Wow, this has never been done before.

1371
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:23,400
I'm always shocked at the games that somehow have not made it to the classic game of the week yet.

1372
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,320
And this is one of them.

1373
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:36,960
So Ikaruga is a shoot-em-up that was developed by Treasure, and it is the spiritual successor to a radiant silver gun that came out in 1998.

1374
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:54,480
This was originally released in Japanese arcades in December of 2001, where you play a pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using a specially designed fighter called the Ikaruga that can flip between polarities from black to white.

1375
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,320
The polarity is really the foundation of the game.

1376
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,560
So all of the enemies and bullets are either black or white.

1377
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:08,240
The bullets of the same color as the player are absorbed while the others will hurt you.

1378
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,320
So you can actually switch between the both.

1379
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,440
And the game has both single and co-op mode.

1380
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:27,920
A little bit about its development is that the director had been working on some things.

1381
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:38,240
By the way, that's Iuchi Hiroshi, but he'd been working on the game during off hours when Treasure was making Sin and Punishment in 2000.

1382
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:48,160
It began as a direct sequel to Radiant Silver Gun and had the polarity mechanism from Silhouette Mirage from 1997.

1383
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,400
The prototype had limited ammo.

1384
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:58,480
The bullet absorption was meant to refill ammo, but they found it weak since it caused breaks in the action.

1385
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:04,360
And also Treasure has a very specific game design philosophy.

1386
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:16,560
And Ikaruga was intentionally built to challenge the conventions of standard game design and develop a new type of shooting game.

1387
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:27,240
So altogether, five of the staff at Treasure worked on Ikaruga and then three of the support staff from G-Rev.

1388
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:35,840
So when it was released in Japanese arcades, it really had a mixed reaction.

1389
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,840
It was new, it was different.

1390
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,920
People were like, we don't like different stuff.

1391
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:47,040
But, you know, it was a little bit more like a puzzle where you could dodge those bullets or absorb the bullets.

1392
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:53,160
It did get a port to the Dreamcast in 2002, which I have.

1393
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:04,840
And then it started developing a following from import gamers, especially the people who probably couldn't afford Radiant Silver Gun,

1394
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:09,000
like somebody talking on this microphone sitting in this chair right now.

1395
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:18,360
It did get a later release in the West in 2003 on GameCube and had very positive reviews.

1396
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:23,600
It was praised for graphics and the art and the sound design.

1397
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:34,040
People's biggest problem with it was its difficulty, but they all thought that the game design was really innovative

1398
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:44,200
and that it just basically, you know, kicked other shooter games kind of on its side.

1399
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:51,760
So, of course, it was ported to the Xbox 360, to Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4.

1400
01:18:52,200 --> 01:19:01,120
And now in retrospect, this game was considered to be one of the best shoot-em-ups and one of Treasure's best games.

1401
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,760
So a little bit more about the gameplay.

1402
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,240
It is vertically scrolling.

1403
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,200
You can either play single or two-player co-op.

1404
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:22,240
And so when you see a burst of bullets of a certain color, you can switch to that color of bullet to absorb,

1405
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:27,080
but you have to shoot with the opposite color one.

1406
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,680
Now, Fifth Stream is talking about turning your TV on the side.

1407
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,640
You can get monitors that swivel.

1408
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:41,600
And I have to check my Dreamcast version, but I think that it did support vertical mode.

1409
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:48,320
But the home ports also had additional gameplay modes.

1410
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:56,480
You could have practice from single stages that you've already unlocked at normal or slow speed.

1411
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,840
There's a challenge mode that logs your score in comparison to others worldwide.

1412
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:14,600
And then if conditions are met, there's a prototype mode which limits your bullets and you have to replace your bullets by absorbing other bullets to refill your ammo.

1413
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:26,440
And then there's an alternative way called Bullet Eater, where you do not fire any shots and navigate through the game by absorbing bullets.

1414
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:36,600
So with the development of it, it was self-funded and self-published.

1415
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:50,800
It was worked on at home and the prototype was made between Iichi Hiroshi and Nakagawa Atsutomo.

1416
01:20:50,800 --> 01:21:09,760
And they borrowed elements from their own other games, and as far as the defense system, that was inspired by Shinrei Jusatsuchi Tadomaru that came out on Sega Saturn.

1417
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:21,960
Some sprites were reused from Radiant Silver Gun to do the prototype quickly, and then they brought it up for testing and finally implemented the final system.

1418
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,280
So it is considered a spiritual sequel.

1419
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:31,120
Radiant Silver Gun was supposed to be a trilogy, and so Ikaruga was supposed to be the direct sequel.

1420
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:42,600
And it was codenamed Project RS2, as in Radiant Silver Gun 2, where the concept for Radiant Silver Gun was a world for Ikaruga, it was will.

1421
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:47,200
And so they really wanted to just push the limits and change things.

1422
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,720
But after a while, it sort of became its own creature.

1423
01:21:51,720 --> 01:22:01,720
It was targeted to Treasure's core fan base, so they were really looking for what Treasure fans wanted, not necessarily a broader market.

1424
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:11,720
And the NAOMI version was actually bug checked on a Dreamcast, so doing the port was really easy.

1425
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:21,720
So it was released in arcades on December 20th, 2001, and the Dreamcast port was exclusively sold in Japan starting September 5th, 2002.

1426
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:26,720
And lots of people imported it. I imported it. That game was great.

1427
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:32,720
It was published for GameCube in Japan under the Atari label.

1428
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:37,720
Sorry, Infogrames did that release on January 16th, 2003.

1429
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:42,720
And then later on it came out in the US and Europe on GameCube.

1430
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:51,720
And it was because of that import fan base that it saw really big success on the GameCube.

1431
01:22:51,720 --> 01:23:04,720
So Microsoft released it for Xbox Live for Xbox 360 on April 9th, 2008, with new leaderboards, achievements, and recording and replaying your playthroughs.

1432
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:14,720
Treasure released Ikaruga on the Nesic Axe Live, which is an arcade distribution platform, on August 8th, 2013.

1433
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:20,720
And then Treasure put it on Steam Greenlight for Windows.

1434
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:28,720
And then it came out on Steam on February 18th, 2014, published by Nichols for Nintendo Switch on May 29th, 2018.

1435
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:32,720
It also supported horizontal and vertical screen orientation.

1436
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:37,720
June 2018, it came on PlayStation 4, November 22nd, 2019.

1437
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:42,720
There were physical copies in production for the Switch and the PlayStation 4.

1438
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:48,720
It was, I mean, this game got some pretty hardcore great reviews.

1439
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:52,720
It was considered innovative, clever, and unique.

1440
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:57,720
The difficulty was a plus for some, a minus for others.

1441
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:11,720
So the Dreamcast version for GameSpot and Dorimaga were about an 8.5 out of 10.

1442
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:17,720
The GameCube versions, Famitsu gave it a 36 out of 40, which is pretty damn good.

1443
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,720
Nintendo Life gave it a 9 out of 10.

1444
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:23,720
Metacritic gave it an 85 out of 100.

1445
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:27,720
So it was an amazing seller.

1446
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:33,720
The Dreamcast and GameCube versions sold 33,860 physical units in Japan.

1447
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:40,720
Xbox Live Arcade sold 137,088 digital units as of 2011.

1448
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:50,720
And the PC version on Steam sold 128,543 digital units as of July 1st, 2018.

1449
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:51,720
And there you go.

1450
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:56,720
I agree with Questbuster in chat who says it's such a beautiful game too.

1451
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,720
Treasures creativity really shines through.

1452
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,720
It is, but I gotta be honest, like this game is very hard for me to play.

1453
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:05,720
Like I have a hard time wrapping my head around the polarity mechanic.

1454
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:11,720
Like it's just, it's a lot to manage, you know, but yeah, like watching this video

1455
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,720
that we're seeing live on Twitch of somebody doing now,

1456
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:16,720
I think this is some type of record run, but still I'm just like,

1457
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,720
oh my gosh, there's just so much going on in the game.

1458
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,720
Seeing this game beaten in person.

1459
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,720
Yeah, yeah.

1460
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,720
With an almost perfect playthrough.

1461
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,720
Or when they do the bullet eater modes, that's always fun.

1462
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:30,720
Yeah.

1463
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,720
The bullet eater mode is ridiculous.

1464
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,720
But I mean, this game is just so beautiful.

1465
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:41,720
I mean, there's times where, you know, I'll come in and Dan was napping on the couch

1466
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,720
with a playthrough of Ikaruga in the background to listen to the soundtrack.

1467
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,720
But it's so beautiful.

1468
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:51,720
And for a game that came out in 2001.

1469
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:56,720
So we're talking about a game that's 21 years old as of December.

1470
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:01,720
This game still stands up graphically and by artistry and by music.

1471
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:05,720
It's really, really timeless.

1472
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,720
I say it's timeless.

1473
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,720
It's a true classic.

1474
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,720
And again, why I kind of joked at the beginning there,

1475
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,720
sometimes we have games in this segment where it's like, really?

1476
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:15,720
We haven't done that before?

1477
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,720
But no, we just we just talk about it a lot,

1478
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,720
but never officially as a classic game of the week.

1479
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:23,720
But now that has been remedied.

1480
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,720
It is.

1481
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:27,720
It's just a perfect game.

1482
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:28,720
Yeah.

1483
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,720
All right.

1484
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,720
That's what I call a perfect game.

1485
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,720
Ikaruga, the classic game of the week.

1486
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,720
Need we say more?

1487
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,720
All right.

1488
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,720
We're going to travel around and check out some news quickly

1489
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,720
in a segment called Rapid Fire News.

1490
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,720
And Loki, we'll start with you.

1491
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,720
I keep telling myself I don't need things like this

1492
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,720
because I have no place to put them.

1493
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,720
But good luck.

1494
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:55,720
Nintendo and Lego have partnered again to create a new Lego thing.

1495
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:59,720
And this time it is King Koopa.

1496
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:06,720
So you can get a very large scale Koopa creation.

1497
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,720
They call it the Mighty Bowser.

1498
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,720
That's what it is.

1499
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,720
It's going to be in stores October 1st

1500
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:14,720
for two hundred and sixty nine ninety nine.

1501
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,720
Too expensive.

1502
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,720
I'm not paying three hundred dollars.

1503
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,720
I'm not paying three hundred dollars for that.

1504
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,720
Sorry.

1505
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,720
I love Legos.

1506
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,720
I love doing all that stuff, but no.

1507
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:26,720
You know what?

1508
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,720
I came damn close to buying before I bought the Spice Girls thing,

1509
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,720
which was only like maybe 40 bucks, which Spice Girls are priceless.

1510
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,720
I'll pay whatever for that.

1511
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,720
But the which also.

1512
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,720
OK, a second tangent.

1513
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:43,720
Do you know how like there's that whole generation that a lot of us fit into,

1514
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:47,720
which is like somewhere between the geriatric millennial

1515
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:51,720
and the young Gen X that is often called like the Oregon Trail generation

1516
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,720
or Zillennial, I think is the other one.

1517
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,720
I heard that called the other day the Spice Girls generation.

1518
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,720
And I was like, that's what I want.

1519
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,720
That's me.

1520
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:00,720
Yes.

1521
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,720
Use that one referring to my people.

1522
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,720
But anyway, not me.

1523
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,720
Well, humbug.

1524
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,720
Anyway, like I was in the radio head,

1525
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:16,720
but in all seriousness, I did not realize you could still get the Lego

1526
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,720
NES with the the rolling TV and that stuff.

1527
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,720
I thought that was like a limited edition thing, but they still had it at the store.

1528
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,720
So I really wanted to get that.

1529
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,720
I still might.

1530
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:26,720
I don't know.

1531
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,720
We'll see.

1532
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:28,720
But they passed.

1533
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:31,720
So there's there's buttons on this thing where you can puppet him

1534
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,720
to make him move around and shoot fireballs.

1535
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,720
I may have to get this.

1536
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:37,720
Just say it's for the kids.

1537
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,720
Say it's for the kids.

1538
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,720
Who's going to actually believe that, Rob?

1539
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,720
No one's going to believe that.

1540
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:44,720
All right.

1541
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,720
What else you got?

1542
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,720
And then, of course, this is kind of funny.

1543
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:55,720
So there was an Xbox live stream that was shown on Twitch.

1544
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:59,720
And apparently during the clip.

1545
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:03,720
It's it was it was saying that, oh,

1546
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:06,720
my acting coach actually is the voice of She-Hulk,

1547
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,720
and I won't say her name because I don't know if that's public knowledge yet.

1548
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,720
I think it is if it was announced.

1549
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:17,720
And then unfortunately, the lead designer is like, nope, we never announced She-Hulk.

1550
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,720
We don't announce things on these live streams.

1551
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:27,720
So unfortunately, it's been rumored that She-Hulk is coming to the Marvel's Avengers game.

1552
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,720
Looks like that's going to be.

1553
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,720
She's awesome.

1554
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:37,720
Probably if I were to guess, because they've been releasing characters in certain cadence.

1555
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:42,720
There is a Marvel She-Hulk show that's starting in August, right?

1556
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,720
I mean, it's probably going to be when that comes out.

1557
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,720
That's a pretty good guess.

1558
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,720
It's a pretty safe wager there.

1559
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,720
But you know what?

1560
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,720
Hosting live is hard.

1561
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,720
And sometimes I can speak with some authority on that.

1562
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,720
And you know what?

1563
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:01,720
Sometimes, now granted, I don't host stuff where I have NDAs in the back of my head,

1564
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,720
but I can see where somebody makes some mistakes.

1565
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:08,720
I actually feel sorry for the host, you know, even though it makes a moment that goes viral.

1566
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,720
That's not the thing you want to go viral for.

1567
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,720
It's just a bummer.

1568
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:16,720
So I hope she doesn't get reprimanded or anything.

1569
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,720
It's just unfortunate.

1570
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,720
So, all right.

1571
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,720
Dark Soccer, you have something.

1572
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:23,720
I do.

1573
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:31,720
So, for fans of The Matrix, The Matrix Awakens will be delisted this week.

1574
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:38,720
Because the Unreal Engine 5 experience will be leaving the digital consoles on July 9th.

1575
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:43,720
If you have it, then you can still use it.

1576
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:46,720
You can kind of like how the PT was.

1577
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:52,720
But if you don't get it by yesterday, there's no getting it again.

1578
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,720
Which I forgot to do. I'm really mad at myself.

1579
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,720
It's fine.

1580
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,720
I know.

1581
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:02,720
But maybe someone will put out a clone or something.

1582
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:03,720
Maybe, maybe.

1583
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:06,720
Yeah, but at any rate, you know, there's always the internet.

1584
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:07,720
You can always watch it online.

1585
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:08,720
True.

1586
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,720
All right, well, I also have one quick story for you.

1587
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,720
And it's something that Jason mentioned in the intro to the show tonight.

1588
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,720
And he said this made him smile.

1589
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:19,720
And yeah, this made me smile really big, too.

1590
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:24,720
And it makes me want to pay attention to this console that admittedly I'm not paying enough attention to.

1591
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,720
It's a great console.

1592
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,720
You've got my attention, that's for sure.

1593
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,720
And that is Evercade.

1594
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:32,720
And their C64 collection that's coming out.

1595
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:36,720
Fourteen classic games from the Commodore 64.

1596
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:42,720
Including summer games, winter games, Impossible Mission, Jumpman, so like all the epic necessities.

1597
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,720
I love Jumpman.

1598
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,720
I love Jumpman.

1599
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:49,720
Gateway to ASFI, the Movie Monster game, which I don't see that one in collections a lot.

1600
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,720
Storm Lord, Battle Valley, Alley Cat.

1601
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:55,720
I know I played that one when I was younger.

1602
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:58,720
Street Sports Baseball, because you have to have a sports game in there.

1603
01:31:58,720 --> 01:31:59,720
And so on and so on.

1604
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:02,720
I got to say, this collection looks awesome.

1605
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:08,720
Now, of course, the mini Commodore 64 has 30 games on it, and this only has 14.

1606
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:11,720
But it's a pretty solid list of 14 games.

1607
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:17,720
And they do label it the C64 Collection 1, which indicates there will be more in the future.

1608
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:18,720
But I think this is pretty cool.

1609
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:22,720
And I got to say, I'm kind of interested in picking up an Evercade.

1610
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:26,720
And I don't know a lot about it, but it's because it's mostly...

1611
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,720
They're made in Europe, right?

1612
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,720
So they're not exactly on the shelves here, right?

1613
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:31,720
Yeah, they're...

1614
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:35,720
I don't know if I've ever seen them on the shelves, but they have like a ton of stuff in there.

1615
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:40,720
Yeah, they have a ton of Atari stuff, and they have a lot of cartridges.

1616
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:46,720
I wish I could get involved with some of this, but there's a lot of Nest Maker game collections that are on there.

1617
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:57,720
There's a lot of stuff, and plus they have a handheld console, and then they have the actual physical console that's in a TV.

1618
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:03,720
What's kind of cool about the TV consoles is you can actually have two of your cartridges loaded in there at the same time.

1619
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:06,720
So you can play a bunch of games on there.

1620
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:13,720
But yeah, it's a pretty solid console, I think, with all the different things coming out.

1621
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:21,720
Speaking of which, I know there's a new Commodore 64 mini console coming out, but it's more of a computer that they're charging like $500 for.

1622
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:24,720
Yeah, it's kind of like what the Atari VCS thing, yeah.

1623
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:29,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a nice shell, but this is pretty cool to see this kind of stuff.

1624
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,720
Did they say California games? Oh, summer games?

1625
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,720
No, summer games and winter games.

1626
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,720
So it's missing summer games too, and it's missing California games.

1627
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,720
Well, that's probably where number two is going to be.

1628
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:45,720
Exactly. So just so we're clear, some of the stuff that's on the Evercade.

1629
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:50,720
Evercade has right now 27 cartridges for consoles.

1630
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:56,720
And what's kind of cool about it, I mean, you start with like the Atari collection, the Namco collection, right?

1631
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:02,720
But then you start to really get the Atari Lynx collection is available, one and two.

1632
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:10,720
The Codemasters collection, there's an Intellivision collection, the Gremlin collection, which I think is kind of cool.

1633
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,720
And then they have some arcade stuff too.

1634
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:15,720
So there's, yeah, it's pretty cool.

1635
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,720
And now they're getting into this computer cartridge collection.

1636
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:21,720
So with the C64 collection, I'm sure there'll be more.

1637
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:22,720
There'll have to be more.

1638
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:26,720
Yeah, I don't know where locally I can get an Evercade, but those are pretty cool looking.

1639
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,720
Yeah, that's pretty neat.

1640
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,720
It definitely has my attention. I might have to pick some of that up.

1641
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:34,720
I love the fact that there's like a TV console and a handheld one and the cartridges kind of work on both.

1642
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,720
It's pretty cool.

1643
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:41,720
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some new games you can check out this week.

1644
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,720
Well, maybe some repackaging and remasters too.

1645
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:48,720
But let's check out the world release date, starting with the US with Loki.

1646
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:55,720
Yes, so I can't imagine there's a whole lot coming out in July, which is typically the case.

1647
01:34:55,720 --> 01:35:00,720
We've got Fist, Forged in Shadow Torch.

1648
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,720
That is coming out on Nintendo Switch.

1649
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:08,720
Garden Story on Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1650
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,720

1651
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,720
Oh, I'm sorry, that's Hell Point.

1652
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:15,720
That's on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:29,720

And same with that, Monument Valley 2, the Panoramic Edition, also on PC.

1657
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:41,720
And then Time on Frog Island on PC, Nintendo Switch.

1658
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:45,720
PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

1659
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:49,720
I don't believe this is a sequel to Frog Fractions, unfortunately.

1660
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,720
Loopmancer on PC.

1661
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:56,720
Rune Factory 5, also on PC.

1662
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:01,720
Tales of Biston on PC and Xbox One.

1663
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,720
Okay, I guess there's everything coming out this week.

1664
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,720
You know, normally July is pretty light.

1665
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:13,720
Azure Strikers Gunvolt 2 on Xbox One, Xbox Series.

1666
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:17,720
What is this title?

1667
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:20,720
Let's see, Chickip Dancers.

1668
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:26,720

Mothman 1966 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1674
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:00,720
The most exciting release of the week, Powerwash Simulator.

1675
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,720
I'm guessing we're finally hitting 1.0 or something like that.

1676
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:06,720
That's on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1677
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:07,720
Game Pass for that one.

1678
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:09,720
Yep, Game Pass.

1679
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:12,720
Worth Life on Nintendo Switch.

1680
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:17,720

1681
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:22,720
And last but not least, The Future You've Been Dreaming Of on PC.

1682
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:23,720
It's a simulation game.

1683
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,720
Fun.

1684
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,720
All right, we're going to Japan.

1685
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:29,720
It's not quite as crowded as Loki's US list,

1686
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,720
but we do have some of the crossovers on the Nintendo Switch in Japan this week.

1687
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:38,720
We had that same Chik-Kip Dancers, which that sounded like a Japanese release anyway.

1688
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:42,720
But yeah, that same release is on the Switch in Japan on the 14th,

1689
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:47,720
as is Bokuura no Kishigomu Otoshi Shingake.

1690
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:52,720
Plus, All Seasons in Joy set is also on the Switch this week.

1691
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:54,720
I think it's a collection of games.

1692
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:59,720
It looks like curling and hockey and a bunch of mini sports games,

1693
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,720
maybe played in a school yard type of thing.

1694
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:05,720
Wreckfest is also out on the Switch this week in Japan.

1695
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:10,720
Going to the PlayStation 5, Outward is the big release this week on the PlayStation 5,

1696
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:14,720
and that is the Definitive Edition that is releasing in Japan this week.

1697
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,720
Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

1698
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:21,720
All on the 15th for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch,

1699
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:25,720
DC League of Super Pets, Adventure of Crypto and Ace,

1700
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:30,720
and then Ultra Age on PlayStation and Switch, and that is it.

1701
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,720
All right. We have a few more stories for you,

1702
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,720
and then we will get to the listener roundtable,

1703
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,720
where we'll be taking your calls in our green room,

1704
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,720
as well as your emails.

1705
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:42,720
Participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to email us.

1706
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:45,720
Let's get to this next story, which...

1707
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:50,720
Just get to it, Loki, while I sigh.

1708
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:53,720
Yeah, so before we get to that,

1709
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:56,720
I wanted to mention the United States Best Buy carries the advocate.

1710
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:57,720
Oh, really?

1711
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,720
So that might be worth checking out.

1712
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:00,720
That's some good news.

1713
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:01,720
Yes, that's some good news.

1714
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,720
Not good news, unfortunately,

1715
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:09,720
is apparently there's been some misunderstandings.

1716
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:14,720
Apparently, the Prime Minister of Japan,

1717
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:19,720
Shinzo Abe, has been assassinated,

1718
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:25,720
and in Greece, apparently, some news station identified,

1719
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:30,720
or showed a picture of Hideo Kojima as the assassin.

1720
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,720
Now, I don't think that's correct.

1721
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,720
It is not correct. Let's be clear.

1722
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,720
Obviously.

1723
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,720
And so they've been kind of, you know,

1724
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:43,720
spreading this misinformation for a while.

1725
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:46,720
So now that that's, you know, come out,

1726
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:48,720
obviously, Hideo Kojima is like,

1727
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,720
no, I'm not the assassin,

1728
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:53,720
and then also, I'm going to sue you

1729
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:56,720
if you keep, you know, posting my photo

1730
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:58,720
and saying I'm the assassin.

1731
01:39:58,720 --> 01:39:59,720
Good for him.

1732
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:02,720
So, you know, he's not going to tolerate such libel.

1733
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:03,720
Good.

1734
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:06,720
And unfortunately, and I'm going to fully admit,

1735
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,720
I don't know how true this is,

1736
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,720
but I have seen this happen in the past

1737
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:14,720
where 4chan and those sites,

1738
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,720
that whole part of the internet,

1739
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:22,720
pushes this fake agenda on these sites

1740
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:24,720
that don't know how to do their research.

1741
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:27,720
Stop getting your news from 4chan, period.

1742
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:28,720
For sure.

1743
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:30,720
But that's why it's not funny.

1744
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:34,720
Like this is, it's racist, quite frankly,

1745
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,720
you know, that, you know,

1746
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:40,720
that Kojima gets the pin because, you know,

1747
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:42,720
they don't know how to do their research

1748
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:43,720
and this whole stuff.

1749
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:45,720
It's just, it's disgusting.

1750
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:47,720
And it's not funny,

1751
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:50,720
but it's a part of gaming culture, unfortunately,

1752
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:54,720
because who else would think it's funny

1753
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:58,720
to misidentify Hideo Kojima as the shooter?

1754
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,720
That was a gamer that did that.

1755
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:04,720
So, but I say gamer in parentheses

1756
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,720
because not in my circle.

1757
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:07,720
You're not allowed to be a gamer.

1758
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:12,720
I don't want to be a gamer if you're a gamer, quite frankly.

1759
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:15,720
Mike Defton Chat says Kojima should sue.

1760
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,720
Honestly, he should,

1761
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:17,720
because this happens to people

1762
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:20,720
who don't have the resources to sue sometimes.

1763
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,720
And I wish Kojima would sue

1764
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:24,720
and make an example out of it, quite frankly.

1765
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:25,720
Yeah.

1766
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,720
Dark to see it pointed out Kojima Productions

1767
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:29,720
had to go so far as to put out a tweet about it.

1768
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,720
I guess it's gross.

1769
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,720
So, and obviously that whole situation-

1770
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,720
It just can't with people.

1771
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,720
Yeah, it's just, yeah.

1772
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:42,720
Anyway, Questbuster says the politician

1773
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:45,720
behind the information retracted it and apologized,

1774
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,720
but the damage was done.

1775
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:48,720
Yeah, I mean, once on the internet,

1776
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,720
always on the internet,

1777
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,720
and it's like, do your fucking research.

1778
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,720
Don't just blast it first.

1779
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:55,720
I mean, what are you, TMZ?

1780
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:58,720
I mean, maybe this was the Greek version of TMZ.

1781
01:41:58,720 --> 01:41:59,720
I don't know,

1782
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,720
but I guess if they can jump to conclusions, so can I.

1783
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,720
So, I'll just say it was the Greek version of TMZ.

1784
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:06,720
All right.

1785
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,720
TMZ is such garbage too.

1786
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:10,720
Yeah, but it's the exact same thing.

1787
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,720
They'll just publish something

1788
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:15,720
and not caring about the resource

1789
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:16,720
or not caring about the recourse

1790
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,720
and just to get the clicks

1791
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,720
if they just believe it to be true.

1792
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,720
They don't care who they hurt in the interim

1793
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:23,720
as long as they get their money.

1794
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,720
And they'll pay people to violate HIPAA

1795
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,720
to give them the inside scoop on what's going on

1796
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,720
at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Hollywood.

1797
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:31,720
So, it's crazy.

1798
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:36,720
All right, let's move on back to actual gaming news

1799
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:39,720
for actual gamers, Dark Sakura.

1800
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,720
Oh.

1801
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:47,720
Xbox 360 games will no longer be a part

1802
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:51,720
of the Games with Gold starting in October.

1803
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:56,720
They will stop providing monthly free Xbox 360 games.

1804
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:59,720
They've already sent out emails to Xbox Live subscribers,

1805
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:04,720
and Microsoft said that it will continue

1806
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:08,720
to give out free Xbox One games going forward.

1807
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:12,720
So, yeah, bye.

1808
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,720
Yeah, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like,

1809
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,720
ah, bummer, but at the same time, it's like,

1810
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:21,720
okay, this is the equivalent of PlayStation 3 games

1811
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:23,720
still coming out for free every month.

1812
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:26,720
And it's kind of like, I think the ship has now sailed

1813
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,720
everything that is willing to be given away as part of that.

1814
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:30,720
I shouldn't say given away because they do-

1815
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:31,720
Well, they said they hit their limit.

1816
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,720
Yeah, exactly, they hit their limit.

1817
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:35,720
That's what it is, that the well is dry

1818
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:37,720
and there is nothing else that they,

1819
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:40,720
and I'm sure people still have plenty of games

1820
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:43,720
they'd like to see, but the reality is they have

1821
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:47,720
to pay money to get that on the service to give it away.

1822
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:50,720
And there's no more agreements to be had

1823
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,720
in the Xbox 360 space.

1824
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,720
I'm kind of surprised they're still moving forward

1825
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,720
with Xbox One for a little while,

1826
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,720
but I guess that's the equivalent of PS4

1827
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:04,720
and we still see new games coming out at that level.

1828
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,720
So that'll probably still be for a while.

1829
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,720
Yeah, that one is understandable.

1830
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:10,720
Yeah.

1831
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,720
Dr. Seuss says, I don't know if I'm misremembering,

1832
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,720
but didn't they say you could just keep the 360 games

1833
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:17,720
you did claim even if gold lapses?

1834
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:20,720
Yes, because it was a limitation of the Xbox 360 system,

1835
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,720
didn't check for that stuff.

1836
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,720
They built it into the Xbox One and later.

1837
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:27,720
So when you claim Xbox 360 games, essentially,

1838
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,720
you don't claim them the same way either.

1839
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:30,720
They kind of come through a different storefront,

1840
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:33,720
but long story short, you're claiming those to your account

1841
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:36,720
forever because the 360 games don't ping the server

1842
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:37,720
to make sure they're still valid.

1843
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:40,720
It wasn't something Microsoft had built in at the time,

1844
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:42,720
but it's there now.

1845
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,720
So, all right.

1846
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:48,720
Bonstable06 says, my Game Pass expired last week

1847
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:49,720
and I'm not in a rush to renew it.

1848
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:51,720
Well, keep in mind, Games with Gold and Game Pass,

1849
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,720
they are different.

1850
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:56,720
For some reason, they're still different, but they are.

1851
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:57,720
For now.

1852
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,720
Unless you had Games Pass Ultimate

1853
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:01,720
because Games Pass Ultimate includes

1854
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:03,720
the Games with Gold and all that.

1855
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,720
So do keep that in mind is that there is a difference

1856
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:08,720
between this and Game Pass, which I know,

1857
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:10,720
believe me, I think it's weird too.

1858
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:13,720
They should just unify it already, but whatever.

1859
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:14,720
All right, moving on.

1860
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:18,720
I think about whatever is a common parlance these days.

1861
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:19,720
Yeah.

1862
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:22,720
All right, moving on, Lucky.

1863
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,720
It's another bundle.

1864
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,720
It's another itch.io bundle.

1865
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,720
So of course, because we live in a world

1866
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,720
where horrible things keep happening,

1867
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:34,720
we're at least going to try to support people

1868
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,720
the best way we can because we can't stop

1869
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:37,720
the horrible things from happening.

1870
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:41,720
In this case, in light of the Supreme Court's decision

1871
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,720
to overturn Roe v. Wade,

1872
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:47,720
there has been some fundraising done by

1873
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:50,720
Caro Asserton,

1874
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,720
who has put together a itch.io bundle

1875
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,720
with lots of games.

1876
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:58,720
I'm not sure on the exact number, but for $10.

1877
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:01,720
700 creators.

1878
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:05,720
So yeah, it's the indie bundle for abortion funds.

1879
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:08,720
Yeah, 750 games, 600 creators,

1880
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:12,720
$3,000 value for $10.

1881
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:13,720
At least $10.

1882
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:16,720
You're always welcome to get more money for the cause, yeah.

1883
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:21,720
And I'm glad to hear that it's going to the abortion funds

1884
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:25,720
because that's really where the money is needed right now.

1885
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:29,720
I'll admit Planned Parenthood gets a lot of donations already,

1886
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:32,720
but your local abortion funds need it more.

1887
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:35,720
Yeah, so it's lots of games.

1888
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,720
I have so many games on itch.io now,

1889
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:40,720
I don't even know where to begin.

1890
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:43,720
Time to start a new YouTube series.

1891
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,720
There's so many.

1892
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,720
Call it The Backlog.

1893
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:49,720
Oh God, that could last forever.

1894
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:54,720
Honestly, just The Backlog and Steam is enough to have a backlog.

1895
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,720
Oh, trust me. Trust me.

1896
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:00,720
I know. I'm sure anybody listening to the show feels there.

1897
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:04,720
But at the end of the day, keep the focus not on building your backlog,

1898
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:05,720
but the good cause and everything.

1899
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:08,720
And it's always nice to see the gaming community and gaming creators

1900
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:13,720
and indie creators really coming together for a necessary cause.

1901
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:16,720
What shouldn't have to be, but is necessary in this day and age.

1902
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:20,720
Yeah, I really need to pay attention to the forums on itch.io

1903
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,720
to get my game more of these bundles.

1904
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:23,720
I keep forgetting to do that.

1905
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:25,720
And it's like, oh man, I would have done that.

1906
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,720
But fine.

1907
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:28,720
All right.

1908
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:34,720
This last story tonight is very much a what type of story.

1909
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:37,720
But I want to talk about it as somebody who is a fan of this game

1910
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,720
and plays an awful lot of it.

1911
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,720
Even if I don't say it in my gaming week every week,

1912
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:44,720
chances are I probably played some Final Fantasy 14.

1913
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:48,720
And you are probably seeing a bunch of stuff going on online

1914
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:53,720
about a billboard that was recently spotted.

1915
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:55,720
Yeah, this is the deal.

1916
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:59,720
This was actually like an in-game group that decided to buy real life,

1917
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:04,720
not in-game billboards, real life billboards

1918
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:09,720
for an event that was going to be happening in Rain Nightclub.

1919
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:11,720
Here's the thing.

1920
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:13,720
The player housing in Final Fantasy 14,

1921
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,720
people have gotten very creative with it.

1922
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:18,720
And yeah, people run full on nightclubs in these things.

1923
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,720
And they'll put up a Twitch stream

1924
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:24,720
and they'll have like actual DJs DJing live

1925
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:28,720
while characters are dancing in the housing.

1926
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:31,720
And it's a thing.

1927
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:33,720
And it's a thing that's gotten to this level

1928
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:36,720
where we're advertising it in the real world.

1929
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:37,720
So it was a, and hold on,

1930
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:40,720
I got to see if I can get a picture of this billboard.

1931
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,720
At least for those that are watching live on Twitch,

1932
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:43,720
you can actually see what this looked like.

1933
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,720
If you have, I'm sure many of you have come across this already,

1934
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,720
but it's the Summer Bash.

1935
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:52,720
And you can see it says the name of the nightclub in there.

1936
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,720
It tells you what the Discord is.

1937
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:56,720
It even says, and this would make sense

1938
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,720
to nobody who doesn't play the game,

1939
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:02,720
but it actually says we're on the Crystal Balmung server,

1940
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:05,720
Ward 23, Plot 5 in Myst.

1941
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:10,720
And the other interesting thing is it uses trademark stuff

1942
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,720
like the official Final Fantasy 14 logo.

1943
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:16,720
And as I understand it, this is like a Viera hairstyle

1944
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,720
that isn't even in the game right now.

1945
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,720
So it's like hacked out or something

1946
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:23,720
to show up on this billboard.

1947
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:28,720
But my, I mean, it's like the fandom has hit that level.

1948
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:31,720
Two of them apparently went up in Texas

1949
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:34,720
where there, I had heard rumors

1950
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,720
they were supposed to be going up in California as well,

1951
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,720
but I think things started,

1952
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:42,720
as this got more and more coverage,

1953
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,720
I think it kind of got pulled back a little bit there.

1954
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:46,720
So-

1955
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:47,720
Fandom's gonna fandom.

1956
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:48,720
Yeah.

1957
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,720
Also, by the way, Reign Nightclub apparently

1958
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,720
also has advertised in the past,

1959
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:56,720
erotic role play, ERP, if that's your thing.

1960
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,720
And I'm not here to yuck somebody's yum,

1961
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:03,720
but I mean, you don't have to put it on a billboard either,

1962
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,720
but go off, I guess.

1963
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:09,720
Show everybody that disposable income you've got right now.

1964
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,720
So, wow.

1965
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:15,720
Anyway, no word yet as to how Square Enix

1966
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:17,720
may or may not be involved in this.

1967
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:19,720
I don't know.

1968
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:21,720
Anyway, apparently-

1969
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:25,720
Oh, God.

1970
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:29,720
Because you want to see how the internet does things here?

1971
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,720
Let me see.

1972
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:31,720
There's this tweet.

1973
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:33,720
Reporting live-

1974
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:35,720
Hold on.

1975
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:37,720
Reporting live at the Free Company house

1976
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:40,720
responsible for the Final Fantasy XIV billboard,

1977
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:44,720
we have tanks shooting directly at the house

1978
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:46,720
and Shiba's barking loudly,

1979
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:50,720
and there's everybody with their tanks.

1980
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:53,720
Why is there tanks in the game?

1981
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,720
It's a mount of some sort that you can get at some point.

1982
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,720
But the best part is,

1983
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:01,720
was it the Habbo Hotel stuff?

1984
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:04,720
That's a throwback to an inappropriate meme.

1985
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,720
They have all been on Fat Chocobos.

1986
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,720
That is, yeah, that's quite a throwback.

1987
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:11,720
Fat Chocobos is the best mount.

1988
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:19,720
I mean, we've been doing this for over 20 years,

1989
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:23,720
and very few times on this show am I rendered speechless

1990
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:24,720
where I'm like,

1991
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:26,720
This is the internet.

1992
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,720
What else?

1993
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:28,720
What else is there to say?

1994
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:30,720
I just think it's important to say,

1995
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:34,720
please know if you've never played Final Fantasy XIV,

1996
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:37,720
there is much more to the game than this.

1997
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:41,720
This is just people doing what people do on the internet.

1998
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:45,720
This is not the whole and the entirety of Final Fantasy XIV.

1999
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:49,720
This is just people doing what people do on the internet.

2000
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:53,720
This is not the whole and the entirety of Final Fantasy XIV.

2001
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:57,720
Please, please don't believe all that.

2002
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:58,720
Anyway.

2003
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:03,720
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

2004
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:06,720
The Discord post from them was amazing,

2005
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:10,720
wanting to sue people for doing emote reactions.

2006
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:15,720
You bought a billboard in real life.

2007
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:19,720
You took the game to a real life space.

2008
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:26,720
What in the actual fuck did you think was going to happen?

2009
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,720
But people would notice.

2010
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:34,720
Some people.

2011
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:37,720
Oh, we're going to advertise for this thing,

2012
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,720
but not to you.

2013
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:39,720
Don't do this.

2014
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,720
In Texas.

2015
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:42,720
In Texas.

2016
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:47,720
Everything's bigger in Texas.

2017
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,720
All right.

2018
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:50,720
We're going to open up this.

2019
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,720
Including the pains in the ass?

2020
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:55,720
The Discord server to your calls in the green room

2021
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:58,720
over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2022
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:00,720
And hey, I would encourage you to join the Discord

2023
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,720
just to talk with us throughout the week

2024
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,720
about all sorts of stories and things that get posted in there.

2025
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:07,720
We have a call on the line.

2026
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:09,720
I'm pretty sure I know exactly what this guy wants to talk about.

2027
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:11,720
And it's always a pleasure to welcome into the show.

2028
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:14,720
So let's get to our first call tonight.

2029
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,720
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2030
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:17,720
Who's this?

2031
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,720
Oh, he was on Orange Launch Radio.

2032
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:20,720
Let's try it again.

2033
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,720
He dropped into the other channel.

2034
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,720
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2035
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:24,720
Let's try again.

2036
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:25,720
Who's this?

2037
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:27,720
I hope that this works

2038
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:30,720
because it is the one and only Ranma

2039
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,720
and I've been having some PC issues lately.

2040
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:36,720
But I would like to say to my brothers and sisters

2041
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:38,720
from another mother.

2042
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,720
Oh, we got to talk about this RePop shit real quick.

2043
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,720
You sure do.

2044
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,720
I don't know why I lost Loki's picture,

2045
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:45,720
but while I try to get that back,

2046
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:48,720
why don't you tell us what's on your mind?

2047
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,720
It's all about the almighty dollar.

2048
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,720
And I'll say this.

2049
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:56,720
When RePop rolled in with New York Comic Con,

2050
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:57,720
it was great.

2051
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:58,720
It was fun.

2052
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:01,720
I used to do coverage for that convention

2053
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,720
because they wanted press outlets.

2054
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:04,720
They wanted podcasters.

2055
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:08,720
They want everybody to talk about this convention left and right.

2056
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,720
And I did it for a few years.

2057
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:12,720
I am already feeling the familiarity of this story.

2058
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,720
And you heard what I had to say earlier.

2059
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:18,720
And I'm already feeling, oh, I know exactly where this is going

2060
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:20,720
because I've lived it.

2061
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:21,720
But please continue.

2062
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:25,720
And then I apply for one time and they go,

2063
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:27,720
your application is rejected.

2064
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,720
And I'm just like, the hell?

2065
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:35,720
Evidently, Anime Jam Session just wasn't popular enough for them.

2066
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:40,720
We don't get like one million hits a week on our site

2067
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:41,720
and stuff like that.

2068
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:44,720
So we were rejected.

2069
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,720
And I said, you know what?

2070
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,720
I'll buy a badge this year.

2071
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,720
I will never do that again.

2072
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:54,720
From that point on, I decided large conventions,

2073
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:58,720
despite the genre, don't need me.

2074
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,720
I will go to the smaller conventions

2075
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:04,720
where I am appreciated for the hard work that my crew does

2076
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:07,720
and it's less drama and less BS.

2077
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:11,720
Now, the fact that ReadPop is rolling in here like,

2078
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:12,720
we'll save E3.

2079
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:14,720
Oh, we'll save E3.

2080
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:16,720
Yeah, I know exactly where they're going with this, okay?

2081
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:22,720
They're going to turn E3 into what they wanted to do with PAX

2082
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:24,720
and it's a crying shame.

2083
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:29,720
Because I tell you this, growing up reading EGM, GamePro,

2084
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:32,720
I was hyped about E3, what was going on and so forth.

2085
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:36,720
When y'all covered E3, I was hyped for that and so forth.

2086
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:40,720
But I can see the way technology is,

2087
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:43,720
all these companies doing their own thing and so forth.

2088
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:47,720
In a way, there really isn't a need for E3 anymore.

2089
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:51,720
I still say there needs to be one for people in the industry

2090
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:53,720
because I agree with Mr. Blackwolf.

2091
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:57,720
The industry needs something and GDC simply is not enough.

2092
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:00,720
And as you all have mentioned previously,

2093
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,720
when they opened this up to the public,

2094
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:05,720
which they did a few years ago,

2095
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:07,720
when they opened it to the public,

2096
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:09,720
a lot of my cosplaying friends were like,

2097
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,720
oh, we are going to E3.

2098
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:12,720
We're going to get cr-

2099
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,720
I'm sitting there watching.

2100
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,720
No, you're not.

2101
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:17,720
Have fun with that.

2102
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:22,720
Because to these cosplayers and the typical con-goers,

2103
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:27,720
they think E3 is a nonstop party from Thursday day zero

2104
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:30,720
all the way to day three Sunday,

2105
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,720
which in actuality, it is not the case.

2106
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:37,720
I got to interrupt because you just made me think of a great fucking point.

2107
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:40,720
You said Thursday, day zero.

2108
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:45,720
That is huge right there because E3, if I recall correctly,

2109
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:48,720
E3 was always a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday show.

2110
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:50,720
It was in the middle of the week.

2111
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:52,720
It might've been Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

2112
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:53,720
No, it was.

2113
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:54,720
Yeah.

2114
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:55,720
It was Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

2115
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:59,720
And they did that very much intentionally because this was a trade show.

2116
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:02,720
It was during the work week for workers.

2117
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:09,720
So here we are, sign number one, that this is not E3 as you knew it.

2118
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:14,720
This is Weekend at Bernie's with Reed Pop moving E3's corpse around.

2119
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:17,720
Sign number one, what you just said,

2120
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:21,720
when day zero is Thursday and not, you know,

2121
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:25,720
meaning that the con is actually Friday, Saturday, Sunday,

2122
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:29,720
that's your first sign that this is not the same E3.

2123
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:33,720
E3 experiences, dodging people and talking shop.

2124
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:34,720
Sorry.

2125
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:35,720
Sorry, Rama.

2126
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:38,720
I don't mean to interrupt you, but you just made me inadvertently think of a,

2127
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:41,720
Oh, this is, that is a huge thing right there.

2128
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:42,720
Thursday's not day zero.

2129
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,720
Monday's day zero.

2130
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:45,720
No, you are right.

2131
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:49,720
I think I was coming down to the end and for some of us in on the con side,

2132
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:53,720
day zero means you'll pick up your badge and you go back to the rooms and you

2133
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:57,720
start pre-gaming. Okay. I don't think.

2134
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:00,720
That is Dragon Con Thursday. Well, no, actually now it's Wednesday.

2135
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,720
Cause Wednesday's the new Thursday. But anyway.

2136
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:09,720
I don't think E3 is ready for a bunch of semi buzz drunken people just rolling

2137
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:13,720
through playing these games and bitching and moaning and complaining.

2138
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:17,720
No, I, no, but in the long run,

2139
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:20,720
they're not going to care because they got their money, you know?

2140
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:24,720
And I'll tell you this now with this pandemic,

2141
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:28,720
a lot of conventions are out here throwing GoFundMes and so forth,

2142
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:32,720
trying to make ends meet so they could survive a following year because of

2143
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:33,720
all the fees.

2144
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:36,720
AX ain't doing that. They got their money.

2145
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:41,720
They basically have people in the industry handling that and all of their

2146
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:45,720
guests, their companies, they basically told them, well,

2147
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:48,720
since you are the sponsors,

2148
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:51,720
you take care of the guests and you take care of all of that.

2149
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:54,720
You just give us the money. You have your tables.

2150
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:58,720
Y'all do the rest. And I can see RePop pulling the same through,

2151
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:02,720
same thing with E3 going to Intel,

2152
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:06,720
going to AMD, going to Nintendo, all of them. Yes.

2153
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:12,720
I do understand that Intel and AMD doesn't really need to be at E3 per se,

2154
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:16,720
but they are the backbone of the gaming and the technology.

2155
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,720
So they're going to court them anyway.

2156
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:19,720
Intel's been there before.

2157
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:23,720
That's how I got a motherboard for Final Fantasy back from the Final Fantasy

2158
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:24,720
contest.

2159
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:27,720
Yeah. They do like the PC gaming showcase thing.

2160
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:32,720
Yeah. When Kensha Hall was a thing and E3 died with Kensha Hall.

2161
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,720
Well, they were, it wasn't even in Kensha Hall.

2162
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:38,720
It was in the main hall that they did their PC gaming showcase thing.

2163
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:41,720
I thought they had a thing in Kensha Hall for a while, but yeah. Yeah.

2164
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:44,720
I do remember AMD being there at one point too. So anyway, but anyway,

2165
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,720
I digress.

2166
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:49,720
And I'm telling you, if y'all go to E3 2023.

2167
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:50,720
Well, we won't.

2168
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:54,720
And you walk in and you see an arrow that says,

2169
01:59:54,720 --> 02:00:00,720
this way to Dealers Hall and Artist Alley, that's it.

2170
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:03,720
Game over because that's how they're going to make their money.

2171
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:05,720
But on the plus side, you can go to E3,

2172
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:10,720
come out with some nice swag that you bought, you know, just saying.

2173
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:14,720
You can, you can finally tell all your friends, you went to E3,

2174
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:18,720
a show that died in 2017, the year they opened it up to the public.

2175
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:23,720
Or what out? That's all I got to say is pour one out.

2176
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,720
Back in the day when they used to like,

2177
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:30,720
wouldn't even let all the media in because there was too many people coming.

2178
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:34,720
I remember when I went to E3,

2179
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:38,720
it was right before everything was opened up to the public and we had to

2180
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:41,720
submit writing samples for DDR Freak.

2181
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:45,720
To get us in qualified as media.

2182
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,720
We had to be published on the website.

2183
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:52,720
I remember when we were, I remember when we were doing this show,

2184
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:57,720
but the guy that ran the network that we were on gave the E3 badge to a relative instead.

2185
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:04,720
Rob, that's kind of shameless. I'm proud of you.

2186
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,720
What? Nothing.

2187
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:16,720
That was some hot tea right there, my friend.

2188
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:19,720
Anyway.

2189
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:23,720
Uh, where were we?

2190
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:30,720
Oh, we're sitting here enjoying some nice Earl Grey hot, discussing Reed Pop.

2191
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:32,720
That's what we were doing.

2192
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:36,720
And Mr. Rob Roberts took himself the biggest pour of that tea.

2193
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:37,720
God damn, that was delicious.

2194
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:41,720
I have a lot to say when it comes to E3. I can't help it. I have a lot of feelings.

2195
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:44,720
This is why we're here.

2196
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:53,720
Anyway, how many people got COVID at Anime Expo? Let's change the subject.

2197
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:56,720
We haven't heard anything yet.

2198
02:01:56,720 --> 02:02:00,720
I have not heard anything yet, which is completely and totally shocker.

2199
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:04,720
And I will say those photos that everybody saw at AX of the crowds,

2200
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:09,720
that was the first 15 minutes of day one from what I have been told.

2201
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:12,720
That's what the Nintendo's Hall used to look like before they opened the doors.

2202
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:14,720
Because that's pretty much the same thing as what that was, right?

2203
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,720
It was before they actually opened the doors.

2204
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:18,720
But still, I mean, justify it however you want,

2205
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:22,720
but you still had all those people packed in there for 15 minutes. It's not a good look.

2206
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:27,720
But what's interesting is if you had a VIP or Premiere badge, you went through a separate entrance.

2207
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:31,720
Of course. Of course.

2208
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:35,720
Man, listen, don't miss big events like that. I'll be honest.

2209
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:45,720
Rob, we're at a point where people are basically scalping anime convention badges, anime convention concert tickets, and so forth.

2210
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:52,720
They were doing that for E3 a lot. You'd give somebody your badge for the last day and nobody cared.

2211
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:56,720
Nobody was checking IDs or anything like that until they realized they probably should.

2212
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:04,720
I am from that generation where, you know, you bought a badge to a con.

2213
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:09,720
You walked up the street to Kinko's, paying a couple of bucks for a color photocopy.

2214
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:11,720
You cut it out and hand it to a friend and be like, there you go.

2215
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:16,720
Because the staff didn't care as long as they saw the badge and looked like an actual badge.

2216
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:21,720
That's true. That's true. You know what?

2217
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:27,720
A lot of those conventions have like outsource security or like, you know, going through like temp agency security.

2218
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:31,720
And I know this firsthand at a convention that I went to.

2219
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:34,720
I'm not sure if I should. What the hell? It's that kind of night.

2220
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:38,720
It was Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest in Vegas at the Paris.

2221
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:48,720
A friend of mine paid security to get into the show, even though he couldn't get a badge because badges had been sold out for, you know, they got sold out in five minutes.

2222
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:50,720
He really wanted to go. He tried to get a badge online.

2223
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:55,720
He was like, you know what? I'm going to go and I'm going to pay a security guard to let me in. Fucking worked.

2224
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:59,720
Because they don't pay their security enough and they outsource it.

2225
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:08,720
That's true. I know people who have bought bootleg Comic-Con badges that still work with the RFID tags.

2226
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:12,720
Okay. All right. And I'm telling you this now.

2227
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:25,720
When E3 2023 rolls around and RePop will say, you know, we're doing it for the public, within not even 15 minutes, you will see eBay listings for those badges.

2228
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:30,720
You will hear the people complain. And you know what RePop is going to do?

2229
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:39,720
They're just going to count their money and be like, well, I'm really sorry this has happened, but good luck next time, you know, as they count them dollars.

2230
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:50,720
And I know it wasn't here bashing this company, but you know what? We're not really bashing this company. We're speaking the truth here.

2231
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:55,720
We're talking from our own personal experiences where this company really don't care because they got their bottom line.

2232
02:04:55,720 --> 02:05:04,720
There's a reason why I know people who worked at RePop that started Comic-Con and the anime convention left and did their own thing.

2233
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:06,720
And we're pretty good with it.

2234
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:09,720
We didn't boil the tea. We just served it.

2235
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:10,720
Yup.

2236
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:12,720
It's piping hot.

2237
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:19,720
Anyway, let's see. Anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?

2238
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:22,720
Oh, no. Oh, no. That's it.

2239
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:30,720
You want me to spill anything else tonight? Because apparently once you hit that 20 year mark as a podcast, I need that thing for my mug or something.

2240
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:38,720
I need a coffee mug that says too old to give a fuck because that's clearly where I've hit at my 20 year mark.

2241
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:49,720
I've said this countless times on my own show and to other people. I completely, as the song goes, I'm completely out of fucks to give.

2242
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:56,720
As long as I can get up every day and live my life, do what I have to do and collect my paycheck, we go there.

2243
02:05:56,720 --> 02:06:04,720
It's like the picture, behold the field in which I grow my fucks. Lay thine eyes upon it and see that it is barren.

2244
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:10,720
And I will say I love the preaching from the pulpit tonight. Loved it. Loved it.

2245
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:14,720
I'm waiting for the collection plate to go around one more time so I can throw some more bits in there.

2246
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:23,720
You know, Reverend Rob, Reverend Loki and Reverend Jamie. Preach on. Preach on.

2247
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:27,720
Welcome to the PTL podcast network.

2248
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:34,720
The Church of Orange Lounge Radio. A lot of day gamers, OK?

2249
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:40,720
PTB. Pay them biddies. Get you one step closer to that E3.

2250
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:43,720
That's going to suck anyway.

2251
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:44,720
Too much metal for one hand.

2252
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:45,720
All right.

2253
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:50,720
Rama, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can, I don't know, spill some more tea. We'll see what happens.

2254
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:52,720
All right. Take care of my friend.

2255
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:53,720
Take care too.

2256
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:54,720
All right. Bye.

2257
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:55,720
Bye.

2258
02:06:55,720 --> 02:06:58,720
You know what happens when you spill the tea that's too hot?

2259
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:01,720
Someone's going to get burned.

2260
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:06,720
I might for opening my big mouth tonight, but you know what?

2261
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:10,720
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

2262
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:12,720
You didn't. You did not.

2263
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:16,720
So if the truth bothers you. Sorry to hear that.

2264
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:23,720
Well, on top of that, if you see something and you think someone's talking about you, well, if the shoe fits.

2265
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:26,720
Just saying.

2266
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:31,720
Or even if the shoe doesn't fit, perhaps you need a shoe horn.

2267
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:39,720
Either you think everything is about you or you're guilty about something. That's it.

2268
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:45,720
Anyway, let's see. Do we have anything in the mail bag?

2269
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:46,720
No.

2270
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:49,720
OK, well, here's the real tea.

2271
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:54,720
I swear we're getting rid of that segment if we don't get some emails on a regular basis.

2272
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:59,720
Or I guess let me ask this. Let me let me let me say instead of making threats because I'm in that kind of mood tonight.

2273
02:07:59,720 --> 02:08:02,720
I do love the listeners. I love all of you that show up every week.

2274
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:04,720
I love those of you that listen to the podcast feed.

2275
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:08,720
And I know there's many of you that listen and you never say a thing to us.

2276
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:12,720
And that's that's OK. You know what? Lurkers are fine. We still love you.

2277
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:15,720
How would you all like to interact with this program?

2278
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:19,720
What could we do? And especially like the live folks.

2279
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:23,720
I'm here in them because we got the chat. We got the calls. We got all that.

2280
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:29,720
How would the people on the podcast feed like to be heard? Because I'm I'm feeling like emails ain't it.

2281
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:31,720
How would the people. Yeah. Go ahead.

2282
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:35,720
If you want to tweet something and have me read it.

2283
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:40,720
Just tap. Just do a hashtag orange lounge radio.

2284
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:42,720
Send it to at OLR.

2285
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:46,720
I was like, I can give you the log in for OLR. I should have a long time ago and you can just.

2286
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:50,720
Well, I mean, but if you if you do use the hashtag, I'll see it anyway.

2287
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:51,720
No, that's true.

2288
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:58,720
So use the hashtag, you know, or yeah, just Orange Lounge Radio or OLR.

2289
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:03,720
You know, hopefully it won't be mixed in with like some other group called OLR.

2290
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:08,720
But we get we get weird shit that's like for some school, some some private school.

2291
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:15,720
Do it for Orange Lounge Radio. Just one word and I'll see it and I'll read it and judge you.

2292
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:20,720
I mean, listen to your opinions very, very seriously.

2293
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:24,720
All right. Folks in chat, dark to see us as bring back the Twitter segment. All right.

2294
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:28,720
Done. We will. You got it. Twitter segment.

2295
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:30,720
Your tweets at OLR.

2296
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:33,720
I'll use it. Yeah.

2297
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:40,720
All right. Yeah, we'd love to. I mean, I know I might be sound like I'm not trying to sound mean or there's just I know we really we really want to hear from people.

2298
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:44,720
It's every where every gamer has a voice and, you know, trying to get more voices here on the air.

2299
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:51,720
So, yeah, I know tweets are probably easy emails. I think the reality is how often do I send emails anymore?

2300
02:09:51,720 --> 02:10:00,720
I said the show roll out like if I look at my sandbox in my email, it's like the last 12 weeks of show rolls and maybe one other little thing mixed in here and there.

2301
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:02,720
Like there's very little that I email.

2302
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:17,720
Did I send I mean, I my email at work is a different story, but I have so many mail rules set up to put stuff in trash to archive other stuff, to move it into other folders, to save my receipts to another folder.

2303
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:22,720
You know that I actually had a clean inbox.

2304
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:25,720
Because of my mail rules.

2305
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:28,720
If you don't know how to use mail rules, learn. It's great.

2306
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:31,720
Bobby Blackall says Rob sent me stuff about Dragon Con.

2307
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:37,720
Yeah, because, you know, for the fourth year in a row, they didn't want to process our credit card.

2308
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:39,720
I just can't stop talking tonight.

2309
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:42,720
But that originally came in on emails.

2310
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:44,720
So, yeah, I just forwarded the email. It's easy.

2311
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:51,720
But yeah, if I really want your attention, Bobby, I just go to Discord like I usually do.

2312
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:57,720
So, easiest way to send IMs back and forth or if people, people, people, Twitter.

2313
02:10:57,720 --> 02:10:59,720
People sit on Discord more often these days.

2314
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:02,720
Twitter is actually a great place to get a hold of me, quite honestly.

2315
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:03,720
I do use Twitter too much.

2316
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:10,720
And I'm very happy that Twitter is not going to end up turning to the dark side after all.

2317
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,720
Thank God, Lex Luthor.

2318
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:14,720
We all knew this would happen. Fucking.

2319
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:22,720
And Bobby, I am sure that people understand sarcasm and if not, oops.

2320
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:26,720
Yeah. Yeah, hopefully people get our sense of humor by now.

2321
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:30,720
But just to be clear, we're really nice. We promise.

2322
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:35,720
First of all, we don't get new people. Sometimes we do.

2323
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:36,720
We do.

2324
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:42,720
I really, I really want to, would like to have some new blood.

2325
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:45,720
It will be nice to get back out to events again.

2326
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:48,720
You know, California Extreme is a thing.

2327
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:54,720
I really am biting my tongue on something because it's coming soon here locally.

2328
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:56,720
And I'm going to just bite my tongue on that.

2329
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:57,720
I'll talk to you off air about that.

2330
02:11:57,720 --> 02:11:59,720
But that's something.

2331
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:04,720
And then, you know, getting to go to Dragon Con and see people there again.

2332
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:09,720
It's just be nice to get out and talk about the stuff we like again.

2333
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:11,720
TwitchCon will be huge too, I think.

2334
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:17,720
All right, let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

2335
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:19,720
Nope, nothing.

2336
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:20,720
Fair enough.

2337
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:24,720
Well, I think we're getting towards the end of the show then.

2338
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:27,720
So this is the part of the show where we go around and check on final thoughts.

2339
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:31,720
Thank you so much for participating with the show tonight.

2340
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:35,720
You know, as we say, even if you're lurking, we still, we do love you.

2341
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,720
And thank you for being here. You're still a part of the family.

2342
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:40,720
We just, we just, we're just cordially inviting you to speak up to.

2343
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:42,720

02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:45,720

2345
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:49,720
Or you can, of course, tell a friend or two about the show.

2346
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:52,720
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2347
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:54,720
But we need more voices here.

2348
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:56,720
Everybody is welcome at the tea table.

2349
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:58,720
We have, it's very easy to make more tea.

2350
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:00,720
We'll make tea for everybody.

2351
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:05,720
So invite some friends to come and some enemies to come check out the show with you next time.

Excuse me.

2359
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:21,720
Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, on Twitch.

2360

And myself on Twitch at Rob Roberts and Loki on YouTube at LokiOLR.

2362
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:29,720
So, okay, I think that's it.

2363
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:31,720
Let's go around and get everybody's final.

2364
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:32,720
Oh, hey.

2365
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:33,720
We have Dozilla.

2366
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:34,720
Look at that.

2367
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:35,720
Dozilla.

2368
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:37,720
Been listening to the show since 2006.

2369
02:13:37,720 --> 02:13:39,720
Don't think I've ever chatted.

2370
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:40,720
Welcome, Dozilla.

2371
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:41,720
Welcome.

2372
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:42,720
I am happy to see you chatting.

2373
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:44,720
That legit made me smile.

2374
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:45,720
Thank you for that.

2375
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:46,720
I really appreciate that.

2376
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:47,720
You know what?

2377
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:48,720
You know what?

2378
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:49,720
You know what?

2379
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:50,720
Hold on.

2380
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:51,720
Hold on.

2381
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:52,720
Hold on.

2382
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:53,720
I'm going to do a thing.

2383
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:54,720
Okay.

2384
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:55,720
There we go.

2385
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:56,720
I'm doing a thing now.

2386
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:57,720
Okay.

2387
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:58,720
All right.

2388
02:13:58,720 --> 02:13:59,720
There you go.

2389
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:00,720
There you go.

2390
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:01,720
Dozilla.

2391
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:02,720
The thing has been done.

2392
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:03,720
Is it Dozilla or Dozilla?

2393
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:06,720
Thanks, DarkSakura.

2394
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:07,720
That's nice.

2395
02:14:07,720 --> 02:14:10,720
Now you can go back and catch up on all the videos from prior weeks.

2396
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:12,720
There you go.

2397
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:13,720
Love that.

2398
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:14,720
All right.

2399
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:15,720
Let's go.

2400
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:16,720
Okay.

2401
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:17,720
Dozilla.

2402
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:18,720
Noted.

2403
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:19,720
Okay.

2404
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:20,720
I was right.

2405
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:22,720
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2406
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:26,720
So, DarkSakura can go Zilla and do her DBD stream.

2407
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:27,720
So, DarkSakura.

2408
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:28,720
Go, Godzilla, go.

2409
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:30,720
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

2410
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:32,720
What's your final thought tonight?

2411
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:41,720
I am trying so hard to hit 500 followers that it's like I have seven people to go.

2412
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:42,720
I'm so close.

2413
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:43,720
You got this.

2414
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:44,720
So, wish me luck.

2415
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:45,720
You got this.

2416
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:49,720
It's just going to take that right raid to land at the right time.

2417
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:50,720
So, I hope you get it tonight.

2418
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:52,720
I've been getting stranger raids and that's been-

2419
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:53,720
That's great.

2420
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:55,720
Not hate raids, like actual real people raids.

2421
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:56,720
Good, good.

2422
02:14:56,720 --> 02:14:57,720
All right.

2423
02:14:57,720 --> 02:14:58,720
Well, I'm ready.

2424
02:14:58,720 --> 02:14:59,720
All right.

2425
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:00,720
Take care, DarkSakura.

2426
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:01,720
We'll see you next week.

2427
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:02,720
We'll see you later tonight and then next week.

2428
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:03,720
All right.

2429
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:05,720
Loki, your final thought for us tonight?

2430
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:10,720
I'm only 13 away from 500 subscribers on my YouTube channel.

2431
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:12,720
So, that'll happen eventually.

2432
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:13,720
Okay.

2433
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:18,720
I feel bad because I passed 500, but I've had my account since it was just in TV.

2434
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:21,720
So, I've had a long time to build that up.

2435
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:23,720
So, in all fairness, yeah.

2436
02:15:23,720 --> 02:15:26,720
So, I'm waiting for 1,000 now.

2437
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:28,720
We'll see, but I have to stream more to do it.

2438
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:32,720
My final thought is, unfortunately, like it's going to be a lot harder to stream this week.

2439
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:37,720
I have a really big high profile thing at work and I have to commute to another office to do it.

2440
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:39,720
So, but I mean, it's great.

2441
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:40,720
I love my job.

2442
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:41,720
I love what I do.

2443
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:46,720
I love this opportunity, but it's going to cut into my evenings a little bit because I'm not going to be getting home until 7, 7.30 at night.

2444
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:49,720
And then by the time I get home, it's like, okay, eat dinner, go to bed.

2445
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:53,720
So, yeah, but it'll be a good week.

2446
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:55,720
So, but I hope I get to play some games.

2447
02:15:55,720 --> 02:16:03,720
Probably a lot of location games because I'll get to play location games in a new town while I'm waiting for the traffic to die down.

2448
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:05,720
So, all right, that's it, everybody.

2449
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:07,720
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2450
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:08,720
