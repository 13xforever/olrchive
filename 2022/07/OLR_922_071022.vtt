00:00.000 --> 00:12.640
I'm browsing through the stories that will be discussed tonight and make mental notes

00:12.640 --> 00:14.440
about what I might highlight here.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.680
Towards the end, I read an article that is pretty normal, but while reading it, my smile

00:17.680 --> 00:19.080
gets continually bigger.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.800
The first C64 collection for the Evercade is going to include Summer Games, Winter Games,

00:23.800 --> 00:27.560
Impossible Mission, Jumpman, and more, but those first four delighted me specifically.

00:27.560 --> 00:31.120
I'm so vain, I think this story was written for me, but now it's time for your hosts,

00:31.120 --> 00:34.360
Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give you details about this release and the rest

00:34.360 --> 00:35.360
of the week's gaming news.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.800
Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.800 --> 00:45.120
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.120 --> 00:47.080
where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.080 --> 00:55.120
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 922 of our

00:55.120 --> 00:59.320
show for tonight, July the 10th of 2022.

00:59.320 --> 01:04.440
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always every week for the past 20 plus years

01:04.440 --> 01:05.880
with my co-hosts.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.840
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:08.840 --> 01:09.840
Hi.

01:09.840 --> 01:10.840
Hi.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.160
I can say that now, 20 plus years.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.160
Yes.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.480
How are you doing?

01:17.480 --> 01:18.480
I'm all right.

01:18.480 --> 01:27.120
My office is in a lot of disarray since I am going through my uncountable number of

01:27.120 --> 01:33.240
art supplies and trying to organize them, so it's a mess.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.240
That's all right.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.240
You know what?

01:35.240 --> 01:36.240
It's organized chaos.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.240
No, it's not organized.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.240
But what I-

01:39.240 --> 01:40.800
It absolutely is chaos.

01:40.800 --> 01:45.160
But what I do like is that now you have some lights wrapped around your microphone there,

01:45.160 --> 01:46.160
so you have-

01:46.160 --> 01:47.160
That aren't on.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.800
You're so little flourish there.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.800
There we go.

01:49.800 --> 01:50.800
I was seeing that before the show tonight.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.800
It's messy as hell.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.800
But I know the podcast-

01:54.800 --> 01:56.080
Not bad for an Etsy find.

01:56.080 --> 02:00.280
I know the podcast listeners can't see it, sorry, but we do tape live every Sunday night

02:00.280 --> 02:04.520
at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

02:04.520 --> 02:08.880
VOG Network, where you can see video and subscribers here at the VOG Network.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.960
Twitch can check out the video on demand throughout the week.

02:11.960 --> 02:16.200
So yeah, but we try to minimize our visual discussions best we can because it is ultimately

02:16.240 --> 02:19.120
a podcast at the end of the day.

02:19.120 --> 02:23.580
And pod culture in our chat while we are taping live says it's a Tron mic.

02:23.580 --> 02:24.920
Sounds like-

02:24.920 --> 02:25.920
That was the idea.

02:25.920 --> 02:26.920
That's the idea.

02:26.920 --> 02:27.920
All right.

02:27.920 --> 02:28.920
I like that.

02:28.920 --> 02:29.920
I like that.

02:29.920 --> 02:30.920
Which by the way, how nice is this?

02:30.920 --> 02:35.640
Great minds think alike as I show you my Flynn's Arcade shirt because Tron-

02:35.640 --> 02:36.640
I'm wearing-

02:36.640 --> 02:38.640
One of your merch.

02:38.640 --> 02:42.560
Yes, the Hook of Shame, my newest shirt.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.240
The Flynn's Arcade is not merch.

02:44.280 --> 02:48.560
I don't even remember where I bought this, but it does, like Tron is like 40 years old

02:48.560 --> 02:49.560
at this point.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.560
So-

02:50.560 --> 02:52.200
Yeah, it actually hit its 40th anniversary.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.200
Yeah.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.200
Yeah.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.200
So that's the thing.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.540
So it's funny that you and I are on the same wavelength of Tron tonight.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.920
So let's check in with Techmaster Loki.

02:59.920 --> 03:03.440
What Tron inspired thing did you bring to the discussion tonight, Loki?

03:03.440 --> 03:08.600
I brought Jared Leto to ruin the franchise.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.600
Send it back.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.600
Send it back.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.200
No, it looks actually based on the game that's playing behind you.

03:13.200 --> 03:18.280
It looks like you brought Arnold Schwarzenegger to wreck the franchise with, now I know that

03:18.280 --> 03:20.240
one, T2, the arcade game.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.300
Heck yeah.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.280
What made you think of T2 tonight?

03:23.280 --> 03:26.860
Because there's a new Terminator game that's coming.

03:26.860 --> 03:27.860
Is there a new one?

03:27.860 --> 03:28.860
Yeah.

03:28.860 --> 03:29.860
Oh.

03:29.860 --> 03:30.860
There's a new one.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.480
Like a shoot-em-up like the old, like that one?

03:32.480 --> 03:33.640
It's a survival game.

03:33.640 --> 03:40.720
I don't know if it's a shoot-em-up, but I mean, this one's my favorite in the arcade.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.760
You have a few people in chat speaking up, as shown here, Matt says T2 arcade was a massive

03:44.760 --> 03:45.760
token eater.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.600
That stupid truck protection stage sucked.

03:48.600 --> 03:53.980
Questmaster says T2 arcade was great and also knows little known about it, this new Terminator

03:53.980 --> 03:56.160
survival game, but it's planned.

03:56.160 --> 04:01.560
I also, you know, those T2, you know, these arcade one-ups, which, you know, I have not

04:01.560 --> 04:05.560
to be a shill for them, but the reality is you can see one behind me here as we broadcast

04:05.560 --> 04:09.560
live on Twitch, because I have a limited edition BurgerTime, although I don't know how limited

04:09.560 --> 04:12.660
it is because I think they're still on sale on the website, but I digress.

04:12.660 --> 04:14.480
They also have a Terminator 2 one.

04:14.480 --> 04:20.040
It's expensive because it's not the same, though, because they made it a light gun game

04:20.040 --> 04:23.880
and the Terminator 2 game was not a light gun game.

04:23.880 --> 04:28.760
It had like an Uzi that I think is just operating like a joystick that you would move around

04:28.760 --> 04:34.940
and aim with, but it wasn't a light gun game from my memory, at least could be wrong, but

04:34.940 --> 04:38.680
I'm pretty sure it wasn't.

04:38.680 --> 04:43.760
But yeah, I remember I had that game on PC, like back in the day, bought a boxed copy

04:43.760 --> 04:46.160
of it to play on PC and that was fun.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.920
They had a version of it on like Super Nintendo, didn't they?

04:48.920 --> 04:52.480
I guess you had to use the controller to move the crosshair.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.480
I think they did, yeah.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.480
Yeah.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.480
So, all right.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.240
All right, well, we're going to get into some news tonight and we'll talk about our gaming

05:00.240 --> 05:04.760
weeks as well, and this is a pretty interesting place to start.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.360
I was a little surprised to hear this this week.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.360
Let's get into it.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.480
Loki, what is the big headline of the week tonight?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.240
It's coming back, baby.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.480
E3, you know, you've been waiting for it.

05:16.480 --> 05:20.560
Well, now they're going to bring it to its physical form.

05:20.560 --> 05:25.120
Of course, this isn't even my final form.

05:25.120 --> 05:32.900
It's going to be New Planner, so they're going to have the folks behind the PAX conventions

05:32.900 --> 05:35.000
and New York Comic Con.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.800
Repop are going to be organizing it and it's supposed to be coming back in 2023, although

05:40.800 --> 05:46.560
as you probably can guess, it's probably going to be less like E3 and I think more like the

05:46.560 --> 05:50.320
E4ALL that they did.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.320
So we'll see.

05:51.320 --> 05:54.280
Yeah, I don't know.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.440
I don't think it needs to come back.

05:56.440 --> 06:01.880
It's interesting that you compare it to E4ALL and not PAX, who Repop also is probably best

06:01.880 --> 06:06.400
known for running, at least in gamer circles, because they took that over from the actual

06:06.400 --> 06:08.360
Penny Arcade team years ago.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.360
Yeah.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.360
Yeah.

06:10.360 --> 06:14.360
E4ALL is kind of like what I remember what they did with E3, where it was we're opening

06:14.360 --> 06:16.600
to the public and all that kind of stuff.

06:16.600 --> 06:21.040
But yeah, it's just kind of, I don't know.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.840
I don't think it needs to exist.

06:23.840 --> 06:28.720
Well, it's it's I'm going to say this as much as I've been critical of E3 and I've been

06:28.720 --> 06:30.400
very critical of E3.

06:30.400 --> 06:35.560
And that's mostly how the ESA really mishandled it in the last several years, not just because

06:35.560 --> 06:36.560
of the pandemic.

06:36.560 --> 06:45.560
I'm not going to fault the ESA for the pandemic canceling E3 for, you know, 2020 and 2021.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.840
I feel like they probably could have done a little something something this year, even

06:48.840 --> 06:50.320
if in limited capacity.

06:50.320 --> 06:55.120
But OK, so, yeah, I mean, COVID isn't exactly gone, so I can see why they've shied away

06:55.120 --> 06:57.440
from it this year as well.

06:57.440 --> 07:05.320
But I have to admit with this year and there not being an E3, it does feel off like this

07:05.320 --> 07:07.440
whole summer game fest and whatever.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.880
That's not the same thing.

07:08.880 --> 07:14.120
You know, and I think it's because there isn't that tent pole that everybody is making their

07:14.120 --> 07:15.440
announcements around.

07:15.440 --> 07:20.200
You don't have that singular week where you can expect Sony makes announcements, Microsoft

07:20.200 --> 07:23.160
makes announcements, Nintendo makes announcements.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.160
Microsoft is the only one that made announcements.

07:25.160 --> 07:30.340
They did a fine job, but it it was just kind of that was it was just announcements and

07:30.340 --> 07:32.960
it does it does feel like something's missing.

07:32.960 --> 07:38.760
I mean, yeah, but like, I don't know how keen they're going to be to want to spend the millions

07:38.760 --> 07:43.480
on a booth and stuff when they're probably finding similar, if not better success with

07:43.480 --> 07:44.620
these digital events.

07:44.620 --> 07:48.240
It's like, what's really going to convince them to come back?

07:48.240 --> 07:50.200
And like, I just don't see that happening.

07:50.200 --> 07:54.120
Yeah, they may do it around the same time like they did this year, like with the Microsoft

07:54.120 --> 07:56.760
Bethesda stuff.

07:56.760 --> 08:02.000
I just don't really see it coming back to being the E3 we once remembered where it's

08:02.000 --> 08:06.400
like all of like these big announcements and everything around that time.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.260
But like, I think a lot of these companies are just going to be kind of hold them back

08:10.260 --> 08:11.260
on their stuff.

08:11.260 --> 08:12.600
You may have like demos and stuff.

08:12.600 --> 08:16.600
I don't think it's going to be anything different than you see, like a PAX or Comic Con or anything

08:16.600 --> 08:17.600
like that.

08:17.600 --> 08:22.000
I don't think it's going to be this major event unless the ESA is willing to put the

08:22.000 --> 08:28.240
money where their mouth is and in partnership with Read Pop, throw a lot of money at a company

08:28.240 --> 08:29.240
like Nintendo.

08:29.240 --> 08:34.280
And honestly, I'm going to be quite honest, Nintendo is the only one they need on board.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.240
They can even get by without the other two.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.360
I think Microsoft will just kind of do it because they tend to do these things.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.240
But the only one they really need is Nintendo.

08:42.240 --> 08:46.520
And if Nintendo, I mean, come on, look at any other E3 and look at like where the mad

08:46.520 --> 08:48.640
rush in that line always goes.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.060
Like I'm just I'm telling it like it is.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.460
And you I love all the platforms.

08:52.460 --> 08:53.460
I love PlayStation.

08:53.460 --> 08:54.940
I love Microsoft.

08:54.940 --> 08:59.900
There's something about Nintendo and the way that it speaks to the gamer population and

08:59.900 --> 09:03.580
the kid in us or whatever, that people always rush their booth first.

09:03.580 --> 09:08.100
So the only people they really, really need to get on board with this is Nintendo and

09:08.100 --> 09:11.260
their show will be fine.

09:11.260 --> 09:16.680
It you know, I and here's the thing, I don't want to speak too positively of this because

09:16.680 --> 09:24.400
the reality is E3, if it's coming back, it's and I saw this name during Bobby show.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.600
This is completely appropriate.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.840
It's zombie three.

09:26.840 --> 09:31.080
It is not going to be the same E3 that you knew 20 years ago.

09:31.080 --> 09:36.720
Now granted, for better and for worse, because we know there were a lot of issues with E3

09:36.720 --> 09:38.120
back in the day.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.780
But at the end of the day, E3 was a trade show, right?

09:41.780 --> 09:47.260
It was for people in the industry, whether you like it or not, to be able to network

09:47.260 --> 09:52.580
to be able to, you know, get advances of what was going to be coming out through the rest

09:52.580 --> 09:55.820
of the years that people that were, you know, writing articles without advance magazines

09:55.820 --> 10:00.940
and so forth, got a sneak peek at that for retailers to get an idea what you know, campaigns

10:00.940 --> 10:04.580
they're going to want to run to try to push, you know, these things towards the end of

10:04.580 --> 10:05.580
the year.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.540
This was a trade event.

10:07.540 --> 10:13.720
Now unless we are corrected otherwise, and I doubt it, depending or based on who this

10:13.720 --> 10:18.220
new partner is in this, E3 is not a trade show anymore.

10:18.220 --> 10:26.100
E3 is a fan convention, which congratulations gamers, you won.

10:26.100 --> 10:32.340
You're going to get you're finally going to get what you always wanted a public E3 congratulations.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.340
You got it.

10:33.980 --> 10:34.980
But guess what?

10:34.980 --> 10:39.060
It's not going to be as good as the E3 that existed back in the day.

10:39.060 --> 10:41.060
And it's not me being an elitist.

10:41.060 --> 10:43.420
That's just me being factual.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.300
And it gives me even less interesting going.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.340
Yeah, it's well, and it's because the internet is a thing.

10:48.340 --> 10:54.860
And it's because you're going to have companies that are less likely to put out their pre-builds

10:54.860 --> 11:02.700
and early access demos in front of the public, because the public can be a bunch of bitches.

11:03.700 --> 11:09.420
Load Twitter during any public gaming event, and you can see how the public can be very

11:09.420 --> 11:11.900
unkind to games.

11:11.900 --> 11:12.900
So if...

11:12.900 --> 11:15.660
The public is just unkind to begin with.

11:15.660 --> 11:17.700
I don't know what they're thinking.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.860
That's true.

11:18.860 --> 11:25.480
They're, they're going, they're going to only show you games that will be out that summer.

11:25.480 --> 11:31.380
So like, let's, let's say read pop E3 was happening this year.

11:31.380 --> 11:35.700
Bayonetta would go, and the game that they would be showing off that would have the long

11:35.700 --> 11:41.280
line, Splatoon 3, which is out in what, two months, if that?

11:41.280 --> 11:42.660
That's the big game they would show.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.520
They would not show you Bayonetta 3.

11:45.520 --> 11:49.740
They would not show, they certainly as fuck are not going to show you Breath of the Wild

11:49.740 --> 11:50.740
2.

11:50.740 --> 11:53.380
They might, but they might have a trailer on the big screen.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.980
We'll give it, maybe, maybe, maybe a read pop E3 would have given us a new trailer on

11:56.980 --> 11:57.980
the big screen.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.580
You sure as fuck wouldn't play that on the show floor right now.

12:00.660 --> 12:02.460
Absolutely not.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.500
So that's, that's it.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.460
And our chat, of course, is lighting up.

12:07.460 --> 12:12.500
Sj100matt in chat says, I guess read pop does have the connections to try to sway these

12:12.500 --> 12:16.540
companies to come in, but it really doesn't seem like these companies are willing to sway

12:16.540 --> 12:19.060
from doing their own direct style model.

12:19.060 --> 12:20.840
I'm going to stand by what I said.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.420
They only need one company to agree to it.

12:23.420 --> 12:27.140
If they get the one company on board, E3 will be all right.

12:27.140 --> 12:29.700
E3 might be a decent fan show.

12:29.700 --> 12:34.600
Now I have my own issues with read pop and why I don't participate with PAX East anymore.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.580
I don't know how much of that old dirt I want to dig up because it is old dirt.

12:38.580 --> 12:43.540
It dates all the way back to PAX East a long time ago.

12:43.540 --> 12:47.900
But needless to say, there's a reason, PAX burned their bridge with me.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.660
I didn't burn my bridge with PAX.

12:49.660 --> 12:51.700
PAX burned their bridge with me.

12:51.700 --> 12:56.120
So I, I'm, there's a reason why I've never gone back.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.960
And I'm not exactly excited to go to this new E3.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.720
But I'm certainly curious.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.160
I realize the potential that's there.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.600
I realize there is a certain type of weight behind the name.

13:07.600 --> 13:13.640
I realize there is a nostalgia and something does feel missing this year.

13:13.640 --> 13:17.920
I'm just not sure this is going to fix all the problems.

13:17.920 --> 13:22.600
As Joan Hunter-Matt says, the new E3 with carnival rides, figuratively three hour long

13:22.600 --> 13:27.080
signs, merch tables, and covered by G4.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.820
You better believe they're going to be there.

13:28.820 --> 13:29.820
Of course.

13:29.820 --> 13:33.800
And they'll, they'll probably have celebs in the gaming industry available at tables

13:33.800 --> 13:35.640
to sign things.

13:35.640 --> 13:41.440
That's how, you know, it's, if anybody is selling an autograph at E3, I'm telling you

13:41.440 --> 13:45.380
that is not the E3 that it used to be.

13:45.380 --> 13:49.480
Bobby Black Wolf, of course, with an analogy that has been covered before, but it is, it

13:49.480 --> 13:50.480
is great.

13:50.960 --> 13:56.520
Ten years ago, I said that PAX was what people who never went to E3 thought E3 was like.

13:56.520 --> 14:01.400
Now, E3 will be what people who never went to E3 thought E3 was like.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.400
Sure.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.200
I, okay, fine.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.200
I don't mind.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.680
I don't, I'll, I'll drudge up the dirt.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.680
Why not?

14:07.680 --> 14:08.680
Bobby Black Wolf in chat.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.680
I'll spill the tea in chat.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.680
Fine.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.680
I'll read it.

14:11.680 --> 14:15.000
Rob and I were invited to PAX East to be on a panel about gaming podcasts.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.280
The panel was cut at the last minute for the schedule.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.240
We had already bought flights and hotels.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.520
We applied as media and were denied.

14:21.520 --> 14:25.960
They wanted us to be on a panel to speak about gaming media, but ultimately decided we were

14:25.960 --> 14:28.960
not gaming media.

14:28.960 --> 14:33.320
Unprofessionalism, it's too much.

14:33.320 --> 14:40.320
Anyway, Questbuster in chat says, in before another story of a stolen demo at E3 shows

14:40.320 --> 14:41.320
up.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.320
Yeah.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.320
Yeah.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.840
Better, better keep those under lock and key.

14:44.840 --> 14:45.840
Oh yeah.

14:45.840 --> 14:49.920
E3 100 Matt says, Oh, I forgot NFTs and the blockchain will be there.

14:49.920 --> 14:50.920
Yeah.

14:50.920 --> 14:55.080
Um, by the way, Bobby, the one part you left out that's important in that story is that

14:55.080 --> 14:58.480
the public tickets had already been sold.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.680
When we asked about trying to get a public ticket, we were told there was nothing they

15:02.680 --> 15:03.680
could do.

15:03.680 --> 15:08.260
If we did not have a listener who had happened to buy extra tickets, we would have flown

15:08.260 --> 15:10.360
out there for literally nothing.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.500
And then I would really be pissed.

15:13.500 --> 15:17.400
At least I was able to record a podcast on the show floor with some friends.

15:17.400 --> 15:23.060
So I feel like I got something done, but yeah, that was some, anyway, now, you know, if you

15:23.060 --> 15:30.060
didn't know now, you know, so, um, and that's why I'm likely not going to be going to the

15:30.060 --> 15:31.060
new E3 either.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.540
It's going to take a lot to convince me.

15:32.540 --> 15:35.220
I should waste my time with the new E3.

15:35.220 --> 15:42.380
Now granted, and I've been saying this on Twitter and I do believe this, but even after

15:42.420 --> 15:47.620
telling you that story via Bobby, even after all that, I think this is better than nothing.

15:47.620 --> 15:52.540
And it's, it's going to be in a better place than where the ESA had it.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.100
The bar was pretty low.

15:54.100 --> 15:59.940
At least if you go, your information should not be stolen and published online, at least

15:59.940 --> 16:04.660
by a company who claims to represent the electronic entertainment industry.

16:04.660 --> 16:05.660
At least there's that.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.300
They ever do anything with that?

16:07.300 --> 16:10.820
No, they swept it, just hoped it would disappear.

16:10.820 --> 16:16.060
And of course, because the gaming media does not have a great attention span and is not

16:16.060 --> 16:21.980
great on follow-up, uh, it disappeared, but no, nothing ever came of that.

16:21.980 --> 16:29.580
So that's that, uh, anyway, um, so I don't know, um, dark Sakura, I, I w I want to go

16:29.580 --> 16:33.500
back to you cause you've been chiming in that you're not very, you're like, whatever with

16:33.500 --> 16:35.580
this E3, can you elaborate on your thoughts?

16:35.580 --> 16:39.540
Like what, what makes you go hard pass on this E3?

16:40.540 --> 16:46.060
It's the fact that I haven't cared about E3 in years, really.

16:46.060 --> 16:52.940
I just don't have anything in me to give it any attention, especially if it's going to

16:52.940 --> 16:55.600
be just another con.

16:55.600 --> 17:00.340
I could go to a smaller gaming convention and have a lot more fun than I would at a

17:00.340 --> 17:03.220
big corporate stick up the ass thing like this.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.380
That's why I stopped going to Anime Expo.

17:06.380 --> 17:10.540
That's why I will still sometimes go to Fanime, but even Fanime has kind of turned into something

17:10.540 --> 17:11.680
like that.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.440
You know, I don't like going to big cons anymore.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.620
I don't like the over-commercialization.

17:16.620 --> 17:22.780
I go to see the, the, well, in the past I would go see the anime and see the cosplay.

17:22.780 --> 17:27.620
And for a game con, I would go to see the games.

17:27.620 --> 17:33.700
That's why I liked old E3, even though it was, you know, all swag and booth babes and

17:33.700 --> 17:38.340
shit and sometimes you would get free balls out of the deal, the soda, not somebody's

17:38.340 --> 17:39.340
balls.

17:39.340 --> 17:44.860
It was also the only place I ever got diet balls, it was so weird.

17:44.860 --> 17:47.380
But back, back to my point, though, I could go...

17:47.380 --> 17:49.420
For those who are watching their ball intake.

17:49.420 --> 17:50.420
Yes.

17:50.420 --> 17:58.740
But at any, at any rate, it was one place I could go and see the games, see the prototypes,

17:58.740 --> 18:03.320
see what was new, talk to people in the industry, get ideas.

18:03.320 --> 18:12.760
You know, honestly, going to the parties for GDC were a lot more like old E3 to me.

18:12.760 --> 18:23.440
And I mean, this is why I'm actually considering making GDC my thing because I'm working on...

18:23.440 --> 18:31.560
I'm doing a little bit for my web comic, but it's based on a visual novel engine.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.800
So...

18:33.800 --> 18:38.160
I think, and I know you've also spoken about wanting to go to TwitchCon and...

18:38.160 --> 18:39.280
I am going to TwitchCon.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.280
I think Twitch...

18:40.280 --> 18:41.280
I just need somewhere to stay.

18:41.280 --> 18:46.680
I think TwitchCon is going to be great because it's about the community and not about the

18:46.680 --> 18:47.680
games necessarily.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.880
And a lot of people from the community plan to be there.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.400
So that's, that's a big part of it.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.080
I know we're having a big Debbie party.

18:55.080 --> 18:59.480
But you, for me, you hit the nail on the head when you talked about how they're smaller

18:59.480 --> 19:05.720
and less important cons that you get a lot more value out of in attending and a hundred

19:05.720 --> 19:08.640
percent that part.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.360
So there's that.

19:11.360 --> 19:15.920
By the way, Bobby Black Wolf is plugging one of them, Southern Fried Gaming Expo is next

19:15.920 --> 19:20.520
weekend, which is a mid-sized con and VOG is sponsoring it out in Atlanta.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.320
So check that out if you're in the Atlanta area.

19:22.320 --> 19:29.440
Well, there's another thing though, and that's honestly artist alleys, which E3 didn't have.

19:30.400 --> 19:38.000
But when you have an artist alley at a big convention versus one at a smaller con, the

19:38.000 --> 19:44.440
artists from, in my, in my experience, get more out of the smaller cons.

19:44.440 --> 19:49.280
They have to pay less for their places and the big corporate ones are trying to milk

19:49.280 --> 19:52.520
them less, you know?

19:52.520 --> 19:55.680
So there's also that to me.

19:55.680 --> 20:00.800
That gives me a chance to actually some more, especially for a gaming convention, I've been

20:00.800 --> 20:11.160
able to support smaller developers like my friend who's working on Potato Tail.

20:11.160 --> 20:15.520
Bonstablo 6 in chat says Blurred Con was this weekend.

20:15.520 --> 20:21.520
Next big East Coast con is Otakon in the Walter Reed Convention Center in Washington, D.C.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.520
You know.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.520
Not interested in that.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.520
It's too big.

20:25.360 --> 20:26.800
Blurred Con, I bet is awesome.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.800
And those cons that are about communities.

20:29.800 --> 20:30.800
I really miss...

20:30.800 --> 20:33.000
DJ Rama S says F that con.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.880
Oh, there must be a story there.

20:34.880 --> 20:35.880
All right.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.200
I really miss Gamer X.

20:37.200 --> 20:42.600
Now, I understand messy things happened, but I miss what it was with the community and

20:42.600 --> 20:43.600
everything.

20:43.600 --> 20:48.360
And that was a great sized con and everything, you know, that was, I had some really good

20:48.360 --> 20:49.360
memories there.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.400
So that was very cool.

20:52.400 --> 20:58.680
By the way, because Bobby had brought up Southern Fried Gaming Expo, I was curious because,

20:58.680 --> 21:02.840
you know, there's we have our own version of that out here, which I think was the inspiration

21:02.840 --> 21:03.840
for that.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.120
We have California Xtreme and I was looking into it.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.260
Is this month that I'm going?

21:07.260 --> 21:08.260
It is.

21:08.260 --> 21:09.260
It's July 30th.

21:09.260 --> 21:13.880
Do you know for the first time, and I can't remember since when, I don't have any plans

21:13.880 --> 21:15.320
that weekend already.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.040
I don't have a conflicting show.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.460
I don't have a conflicting show because the Rocky show got canceled this month.

21:20.460 --> 21:21.460
So I...

21:21.500 --> 21:25.300
Yeah, I may actually want to go this year.

21:25.300 --> 21:29.300
I'm still kind of feeling out the COVID stuff a little bit, but I think, you know, I think

21:29.300 --> 21:30.300
it'll be all right.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.300
So, yeah.

21:31.300 --> 21:35.380
Well, I did Pinagogo and honestly, that was all right.

21:35.380 --> 21:36.380
Yeah.

21:36.380 --> 21:41.140
Not Pinagogo, but Golden State Pinball Festival.

21:41.140 --> 21:45.380
Plus the mass compliance is just, odds are it's going to be a lot better here than it

21:45.380 --> 21:46.380
is.

21:46.380 --> 21:50.420
I mean, I am going to Dragon Con and I already know, all right, if I don't get COVID by then,

21:50.420 --> 21:56.940
it's probably going to be a high risk situation, but I'm just hoping we have the COVID variant

21:56.940 --> 22:00.180
shot available by then because I know they're working on finishing that up.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.180
So we'll see.

22:01.180 --> 22:02.180
Fingers crossed.

22:02.180 --> 22:04.780
But yeah, California Extreme, I'd love to go to that if it could work out.

22:04.780 --> 22:06.380
So that'd be cool.

22:06.380 --> 22:08.780
Well, you need a ride.

22:08.780 --> 22:09.780
Yeah.

22:09.780 --> 22:10.780
I'll...

22:10.780 --> 22:11.780
You can hang with the pinball crew.

22:11.780 --> 22:13.780
I'll be in touch.

22:13.780 --> 22:21.580
Anyway, so let's see, genuine excitement when we talk about these mid local, more direct

22:21.580 --> 22:26.080
type of cons, these big bloated things, I'm over it.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.080
Maybe it's just my age.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.080
I'm over it.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.080
I don't know.

22:29.080 --> 22:34.300
Well, it's just, it's a big, like, if you look at E3, like let's just say from our perspective,

22:34.300 --> 22:40.300
like to see anything at E3, you have to wait in lines and like with Nintendo and stuff,

22:40.300 --> 22:42.180
that's why there is a big rush to the Nintendo booth.

22:42.180 --> 22:44.180
It's not because the people are excited about Nintendo stuff.

22:44.180 --> 22:46.220
Sure, they're excited about that and everything else.

22:46.220 --> 22:53.020
But Nintendo particularly had like three to five hour wait lines to see a game.

22:53.020 --> 22:54.060
Like no thanks.

22:54.060 --> 22:58.500
I would rather not waste three to five hours of my time to do that when I can just see

22:58.500 --> 23:00.380
it in a video in a direct.

23:00.380 --> 23:04.720
And there's like my 30 minutes of time that I spent watching those.

23:04.720 --> 23:09.500
The worst is when you stand in line and then you realize what you're seeing got pushed

23:09.500 --> 23:12.140
on YouTube that same night.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.140
That's that.

23:13.140 --> 23:14.900
That was the last E3 I went to.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.660
And I think I've told that on the story before.

23:16.660 --> 23:21.380
That was the moment when I was like, I'm wasting my fucking time.

23:21.380 --> 23:26.340
It was just, it's, it's hard to like, even like going there, like it was hard to pay

23:26.340 --> 23:27.340
attention.

23:27.340 --> 23:31.500
Like if you're just not using the internet at that time and just going to E3 and trying

23:31.500 --> 23:36.900
to pick up the information, it's hard to like get everything you're going to miss stuff

23:36.900 --> 23:37.900
on there.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.500
You're a miss seeing things because you didn't know what was going on because it's just a

23:40.500 --> 23:41.980
chaotic mess.

23:41.980 --> 23:46.580
I just can't, I can't imagine this is going to be very good.

23:46.580 --> 23:52.180
I mean, whatever it, it'll be like E4 all, but like, I don't think people wanted that

23:52.180 --> 23:54.140
to come back and it certainly didn't come back.

23:54.140 --> 23:56.140
So I don't know.

23:56.140 --> 23:57.140
All right.

23:57.140 --> 24:01.100
Well, we'll, uh, we'll keep our eye on this new E3.

24:01.100 --> 24:06.020
I mean, even though we're all kind of looking at this going meh, I mean, it is relevant

24:06.020 --> 24:11.500
if they can get the big names to support the show and get those big announcements again,

24:11.500 --> 24:12.540
it's going to be important.

24:12.540 --> 24:16.900
So we'll keep our eye on it and see how things develop over the next few months.

24:16.900 --> 24:21.400
But in the meantime, we'll focus on this month or this week and talk about our gaming weeks

24:21.400 --> 24:23.460
and the types of games that we've been playing.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.580
So Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?

24:25.580 --> 24:27.760
How was your gaming week?

24:27.760 --> 24:32.660
Playing Dead by Daylight and I'm still working on Survivor and indeed I will be playing again

24:32.660 --> 24:35.460
with Finara later tonight.

24:35.460 --> 24:43.220
Um, Finara has been my meat shield so that I can get, um, my adepts and, you know, get

24:43.220 --> 24:44.220
better with the game.

24:44.220 --> 24:48.940
And I'm already at gold four, gold four or gold three.

24:48.940 --> 24:55.580
I don't remember, but, um, I also, I don't know what it is, but I think because I am

24:55.580 --> 25:01.200
a killer main, I have a talent of making friends with the killers, the ones who are in the

25:01.200 --> 25:03.760
mood to be friends.

25:03.760 --> 25:10.280
Like I had a match where basically Finara and I were the only ones who really made it

25:10.280 --> 25:23.160
out okay because we stopped to boop a pig and I've made friends with legions, which

25:23.160 --> 25:26.720
you know, lesion players are notorious for being pretty toxic.

25:26.720 --> 25:31.600
Um, I've, I've made, and I actually, I played a doctor match.

25:31.600 --> 25:36.280
I actually did play a killer match because I wanted to just get the challenge done and

25:36.280 --> 25:40.780
ended up just memeing around and met another streamer.

25:40.780 --> 25:41.780
That was pretty fun.

25:41.780 --> 25:42.780
Yeah.

25:42.780 --> 25:43.840
I actually rated them after my stream.

25:43.840 --> 25:49.200
So I've been, I've been getting a lot, I like Survivor better, a lot better than I thought

25:49.200 --> 25:50.200
I would.

25:50.200 --> 25:54.060
Um, cause the first like doing the demo, I hated it.

25:54.060 --> 25:59.300
And then when I played with some other friends, I was like racked with nerves the whole time.

25:59.300 --> 26:02.480
And the one thing that I do not like is that because I have to use the thumb track ball

26:02.480 --> 26:09.980
mouse for having a bad wrist, um, I can't look behind me when I run, which also means

26:09.980 --> 26:15.460
that I will not have any problem with them nerfing dead hard cause I don't use it.

26:15.460 --> 26:27.940
I am however, not looking forward to adapting, uh, uh, David because no, yeah, however, um,

26:27.940 --> 26:33.880
I, you know how if you do a certain generator in certain levels, you get an achievement

26:33.880 --> 26:34.880
for it.

26:34.880 --> 26:35.880
Yeah.

26:35.880 --> 26:36.880
I have one left to go.

26:36.880 --> 26:37.880
Oh, that's nice.

26:37.880 --> 26:38.880
Which one?

26:38.880 --> 26:39.880
I have, I have a Scrotus pen.

26:39.880 --> 26:40.880
I mean, Crotus pen.

26:40.880 --> 26:41.880
Okay.

26:41.880 --> 26:42.880
I call it.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.880
I call it Scrotus pen.

26:43.880 --> 26:44.880
Okay.

26:44.880 --> 26:45.880
Yeah.

26:45.880 --> 26:46.880
The, the served ward.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.880
I got the, the chapel.

26:48.880 --> 26:49.880
Okay.

26:49.880 --> 26:53.840
Honestly, if you got RPD, that's the biggest pain in the butt in my opinion.

26:53.840 --> 26:54.840
So congrats.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.840
Yeah.

26:55.840 --> 27:02.100
Um, I got with, uh, Nick and anti vortex and I forgot who else, but they were like, no,

27:02.100 --> 27:03.100
you're getting this.

27:03.100 --> 27:06.700
I, someone brought the offering and said, you're getting this.

27:06.700 --> 27:07.700
And so I got it.

27:07.700 --> 27:08.700
Oh, that's fun.

27:08.700 --> 27:09.700
Yeah.

27:09.700 --> 27:13.180
And, and the, the, the killer ended up, you know, pretty much letting us go anyway.

27:13.180 --> 27:16.540
Um, so it was, it was all right.

27:16.540 --> 27:22.900
You know, um, and I got, I think I do have almost everyone adept now.

27:22.960 --> 27:27.600
I know this is all like dead by daylight stuff that not everyone cares about, but I have

27:27.600 --> 27:33.440
Laurie, Ace, Adam, Ash, yeah.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.440
And David.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.180
Those are the ones I have left.

27:36.180 --> 27:38.640
Of course, Nancy and Steve don't count.

27:38.640 --> 27:49.640
Um, I also, um, I still couldn't get my final fantasy, uh, six translated uncensored version

27:49.640 --> 27:51.580
to play in a battle.

27:51.580 --> 27:53.960
Like it'll do everything except do the damn battle.

27:53.960 --> 27:54.960
Oh, weird.

27:54.960 --> 28:00.560
So, uh, yeah, it's, and I think it's just the patch or, or my copy of it or something.

28:00.560 --> 28:04.180
And I, and like I said, I feel absolutely justified playing it through emulation because

28:04.180 --> 28:06.040
I own both copies of the game.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.040
Yeah.

28:07.040 --> 28:10.100
I mean, I have a Japanese cartridge and I have an American cartridge.

28:10.100 --> 28:13.780
How many times do you have to own a game before we stop apologizing for emulating?

28:13.780 --> 28:14.780
Because it's convenient.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.000
I'm saying it because I'm streaming it.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
No, no, no.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.280
I mean, in general, I'm not attacking you.

28:19.280 --> 28:23.380
I'm just saying in general, like the community, like, like emulation has to be acceptable

28:23.380 --> 28:24.380
at some point.

28:24.380 --> 28:26.400
Like, you know, you're just playing the stuff you own.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.400
Like I, yeah.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.400
Anyway.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.400
Yeah.

28:29.400 --> 28:41.800
Um, um, but I, um, I suplexed to train on Wednesday and I did the opera last night and

28:41.800 --> 28:44.820
I will be playing it again on Wednesday.

28:44.820 --> 28:45.820
Nice.

28:45.820 --> 28:51.960
So, but tonight is, is Debbie Thursday and Friday is dead by daylight.

28:51.960 --> 28:56.980
And I'm actually really gonna try to get through the rest of those depths and try to get back

28:56.980 --> 28:58.420
to killer a little bit later.

28:58.420 --> 29:02.780
I think the thing that I like best is just that I've been playing with friends.

29:02.780 --> 29:03.780
That's cool.

29:03.780 --> 29:06.200
I, the life of the killer is a lonely life.

29:06.200 --> 29:10.340
I would love to join you tonight, but I have a major, major work thing starting tomorrow.

29:10.340 --> 29:12.520
So I got to get to bed on time.

29:12.520 --> 29:13.520
So

29:14.220 --> 29:15.640
All right.

29:15.640 --> 29:20.620
But maybe this just during the week's going to be hard just because yeah, I have a major

29:20.620 --> 29:21.620
work thing going on.

29:21.620 --> 29:23.220
So it's all right.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.220
But if you can, you can.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.220
Maybe next Sunday.

29:25.220 --> 29:26.220
Yeah.

29:26.220 --> 29:27.220
Maybe.

29:27.220 --> 29:28.220
It depends how traffic is.

29:28.220 --> 29:30.720
Cause I have to commute to another city this week.

29:30.720 --> 29:31.720
So yeah.

29:31.720 --> 29:34.460
Well, as Dan is fond of saying, real life must intrude.

29:34.460 --> 29:40.480
Unfortunately, it is the way it goes, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

29:40.480 --> 29:45.920
It's been a lot of video editing in Minecraft as usual, like three videos in a week.

29:45.920 --> 29:46.920
Right?

29:46.920 --> 29:47.920
Yeah.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.960
So I had two videos out like last week and then I put one out in the beginning of this

29:50.960 --> 29:51.960
week.

29:51.960 --> 29:58.800
So, uh, the new bill I did was a guardian XP farm and the bottom of the farm is the

29:58.800 --> 30:02.080
giant lantern fish from mega man too.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.880
So I think, I think it came out really well.

30:04.880 --> 30:09.240
Um, yeah, this next, I saw him come up with what I'm building for.

30:09.240 --> 30:13.500
I mean, I have worked on stuff for, with the new frog lights.

30:13.500 --> 30:18.760
So that's a thing that's in Minecraft now where do you bring frogs into the nether and

30:18.760 --> 30:25.160
you break down magma cubes to the smallest little magma cube, they'll eat them and poop

30:25.160 --> 30:27.520
out lights for reasons.

30:27.520 --> 30:28.520
I don't know.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.860
Um, so I have a farm that does that now and it's way too efficient.

30:32.860 --> 30:39.220
So I, I keep cutting back the amount of space that's dedicated to the lights and just what

30:39.220 --> 30:41.900
it's a normal magma cube farm.

30:41.900 --> 30:47.660
And I have to now cut it down to a quarter because I literally have, Oh gosh, probably

30:47.660 --> 30:50.820
20 double chests full of frog lights.

30:50.820 --> 30:55.540
That's more than I'll ever need more than the server will ever need for the entire season

30:55.540 --> 30:57.540
after like a night.

30:57.540 --> 31:02.060
So it'll be, it'll be fun to figure out how I'm going to use those, but I need to come

31:02.060 --> 31:03.060
up with some more magma and stuff.

31:03.060 --> 31:06.940
I think this time that we have to make a shop to sell some things cause I have a bunch of

31:06.940 --> 31:09.740
farms now and I need to probably start doing that.

31:09.740 --> 31:16.180
We just went to the, uh, the deep dark and the ancient city today and that kind of didn't

31:16.180 --> 31:24.180
go great, but we, we did some fun, like, uh, challenge things where we were basically stripped

31:24.180 --> 31:28.300
down to like no armor or anything and we just decided, okay, we're just going to sprint

31:28.300 --> 31:32.100
through this thing and see whoever dies the last.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.100
And I died the last.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.100
So I got, I got 50 diamonds out of that.

31:36.100 --> 31:37.100
Congratulations.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.100
It was fun.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.100
All right.

31:39.100 --> 31:41.100
Um, let's see.

31:41.100 --> 31:45.780
My gaming week, uh, I also play a little dead by daylight, um, kind of focusing on killer

31:45.780 --> 31:46.780
this week.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.940
I played a lot of, I'm really trying to get better with Sadako.

31:48.940 --> 31:53.900
Um, and, uh, I find my matches just, they swing the pendulum either I get four Ks or

31:53.900 --> 31:54.900
I get bullied.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.300
Uh, it just was feast or famine.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.300
Yeah.

31:58.300 --> 31:59.300
It's, it's really just depends.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.300
So I'm just trying to get better with her.

32:00.300 --> 32:04.500
Uh, just trying to get better with chasing on like L wall T walls is really where I need

32:04.500 --> 32:05.500
like the help.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.600
Um, I've also been playing plague.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.460
I kind of consider plague my other sort of main of the moment.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.180
So, um, that's kind of fun.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.420
I just like plague because I feel like she breaks the normal survivor meta.

32:15.420 --> 32:17.260
Like dead hard doesn't matter with her really.

32:17.260 --> 32:18.260
Yeah.

32:18.260 --> 32:20.100
So cause you can just puke on them.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.100
Exactly.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.040
Cause uh, that distance doesn't give you anything.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.860
So yeah, you know, I used to be a plague main.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.420
I, yeah, it's kind of where you started, wasn't it?

32:28.420 --> 32:36.540
I started with Legion and then I was following Otz's, uh, like killer tier, you know, best

32:36.540 --> 32:37.540
perk thing.

32:37.540 --> 32:40.540
And then I finally realized, you know what, I don't really care about his opinion.

32:40.540 --> 32:42.540
I mean, he's great streamer, great person.

32:42.540 --> 32:44.020
I don't person's opinion.

32:44.020 --> 32:45.020
Yeah.

32:45.020 --> 32:50.340
But I did agree that starting off with plague really helped me because learning a hard killer

32:50.340 --> 32:56.100
like that made learning pig a cinch.

32:56.100 --> 32:59.620
I found that tall characters are harder for me to play than short characters.

32:59.620 --> 33:00.620
Yeah.

33:00.620 --> 33:01.620
Which is, and isn't that funny?

33:01.620 --> 33:05.580
Like plague is very tall and Sudako is very short and that's where I kind of live right

33:05.580 --> 33:06.580
now.

33:06.580 --> 33:07.580
Sadako is the shortest one.

33:07.580 --> 33:12.340
I think that comparatively she's like four, no, she's like right at five foot I want to

33:12.340 --> 33:15.700
say or four, four, 10, five foot.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.920
And pig is five, three, which is my height.

33:17.920 --> 33:22.800
But the best thing ever with Sadako is that when you go to hook somebody and she kind

33:22.800 --> 33:27.800
of, you know, she does all psychic powers, when she goes, the hook actually lowers so

33:27.800 --> 33:29.840
that she can get them on the hook.

33:29.840 --> 33:33.280
The hook actually bends down ever slightly during the whole animation.

33:33.280 --> 33:36.320
The hook is like, I will bend to your will mistress.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.320
Yes.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.000
She's like, damn right, bend to my psychic powers.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.240
It's her psychic powers.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.860
So yeah.

33:41.860 --> 33:46.360
Other games I've been playing, I've been continuing to play Diablo three and apparently there's

33:46.360 --> 33:50.800
a group of like, I was reading a story on a website this week about how like there's

33:50.800 --> 33:56.100
people that went and played Diablo immortal and then realized when Diablo immortals like

33:56.100 --> 33:58.300
money making stuff was kind of BS.

33:58.300 --> 34:01.360
They just went back and played Diablo three and were like, Oh, there's a lot of stuff

34:01.360 --> 34:02.360
going on here.

34:02.360 --> 34:06.020
I'm like, I am one of those people because they actually the latest season, they added

34:06.020 --> 34:10.140
a new thing where there's like a whole little bonus room that was kind of fun to play.

34:10.140 --> 34:14.200
And I guess the next season they're testing next week and they're, it's adding a new thing

34:14.200 --> 34:15.200
too.

34:15.200 --> 34:20.040
I kind of thought Diablo was done adding stuff, but they're still adding like little things,

34:20.080 --> 34:25.320
which is great because Diablo three doesn't have microtransactions anymore.

34:25.320 --> 34:29.080
We all know the real money auction house was a disaster, but that is like eight year old

34:29.080 --> 34:30.080
news at this point.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.440
That is a way in the past.

34:31.440 --> 34:35.520
So this is a, the game's in a good place now and I'm having fun.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.920
Alan got back into it too.

34:36.920 --> 34:42.640
So I was helping him level his seasonal and then he got help from strangers online.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.740
He's like double my paragon level right now.

34:44.740 --> 34:48.560
He's like paragon four 70 or something and I'm like 200 maybe.

34:48.560 --> 34:52.360
So yeah, it's kind of, kind of fun.

34:52.360 --> 34:57.800
And then also continuing my GPS games, I hit level 61 in Pikmin and then I haven't really

34:57.800 --> 34:58.800
been playing that.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.600
There's a Pokemon event that happened this weekend, but I've only like half been half

35:01.600 --> 35:02.600
paying attention.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.800
I don't like the battling stuff.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.600
I don't really care for the team rocket battles and that stuff.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.980
I'll do them if I have to, but I've just kind of been ignoring this event.

35:09.980 --> 35:13.520
So but I just want to make sure I catch all the Pokemon.

35:13.520 --> 35:17.320
So I got Pansear who's like a regional who's kind of available right now.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.320
Yeah.

35:18.320 --> 35:22.800
So just try to, try to get the rest of the candy I need to evolve that one and then I'll

35:22.800 --> 35:25.040
feel better about where that's at.

35:25.040 --> 35:31.680
Otherwise one other games that I've been playing, which is random, but it came out on Xbox game

35:31.680 --> 35:37.720
pass, which I also think is random and it's on game pass for PC and Xbox series, but I've

35:37.720 --> 35:42.440
been playing on PC DJ Max respect.

35:42.440 --> 35:49.280
So V, which is fun and it's funny because I own it on steam too, but remember I got

35:49.280 --> 35:52.560
a new computer, so I never installed it on this computer.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.320
So I was like, ah, what the hell?

35:54.320 --> 35:58.200
I'll install the game pass version to get some achievements, but the only thing that

35:58.200 --> 36:04.400
sucks is none of my DLC, cause I don't think the Xbox version has the DLC implemented yet.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.200
Whereas the steam version has like classical and some of the stuff I really like.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.800
So it's sorry to say, but the steam version is a little bit better.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.800
I think still cause it has the DLC available.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.880
I don't know if they're planning on adding that to Xbox, but probably won't be on game

36:16.880 --> 36:17.880
pass anyway.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.000
Uh, it's probably how they kind of hook you in.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.640
So, um, Mike depth and chat says DJ max respect V on Xbox is pretty much the same as the PC

36:25.640 --> 36:28.280
version for better and for worse.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.280
Yeah.

36:29.280 --> 36:34.240
So it's, it's pretty much the same thing just in the windows store and a series X, but yes,

36:34.240 --> 36:38.000
I've been getting some achievements there and it's, it's kind of scratching the 2d X

36:38.000 --> 36:45.080
itch because do you remember how round one was supposed to open here in, um, Roseville

36:45.080 --> 36:46.360
in June?

36:46.360 --> 36:48.680
Yeah, we were lied to.

36:48.680 --> 36:52.960
So apparently according to Reddit and somebody who called now it's like late August, they've

36:52.960 --> 36:59.800
been pushing that lied to, but they've been pushing that back every single time.

36:59.800 --> 37:05.080
But I mean, I understand the first time cause of COVID, but they had, was it cause I'm in,

37:05.080 --> 37:10.160
um, I was in the old Sean against group now it's like sack gamers or something like that.

37:10.160 --> 37:15.220
And they had, someone had posted a picture from today, I think where like the game machines

37:15.220 --> 37:20.080
are on, like some of them are on, I don't know what they're doing right now, but I mean,

37:20.080 --> 37:22.480
it should be opening and I hope pretty soon.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.480
Hmm.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.960
Well, we'll see.

37:24.960 --> 37:29.080
It wasn't, I went by the mall last week and it still wasn't open, but, and I'm sure when

37:29.080 --> 37:30.920
it opens, we'll hear everything.

37:30.920 --> 37:34.680
Does that, is that the same group that had all the games that strikes in Rockland?

37:34.680 --> 37:35.680
Are they all still there?

37:35.680 --> 37:37.440
I haven't been to strikes since the pandemic.

37:37.440 --> 37:41.620
Yeah, they had stuff there and I think at the drive-in as well, and then of course that

37:41.620 --> 37:42.620
burned down.

37:42.620 --> 37:45.060
Um, but yeah, I think they had them at strikes.

37:45.060 --> 37:46.560
I think that stuff's still there.

37:46.560 --> 37:47.560
Interesting.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.240
I just haven't been over there since the pandemic started.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.240
So just curious.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.240
All right.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.600
Um, Oh, that's fine.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.600
I didn't realize this.

37:54.600 --> 37:59.200
Mike Defton chat says I'm playing the Xbox version of DJ Max respect and the freaking

37:59.200 --> 38:02.940
game still tells you press F 12 for X.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.580
And I'm like, I'm on an Xbox.

38:04.580 --> 38:05.580
God damn it.

38:05.580 --> 38:08.720
I, that's this type of stuff I thought they're supposed to find in certification.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.820
That's what the cert process is supposed to find.

38:10.820 --> 38:12.140
So that one must've got missed.

38:12.140 --> 38:13.140
That's interesting.

38:13.140 --> 38:14.140
So, Hmm.

38:14.140 --> 38:15.140
All right.

38:15.140 --> 38:17.840
Um, that's it for our gaming weeks.

38:17.840 --> 38:22.180
Let's get into some more gaming news and what else is going on around the industry.

38:22.180 --> 38:25.700
There's been, there's been some stories this week, so we'll start with Loki and a franchise

38:25.700 --> 38:27.260
near and dear to his heart.

38:27.260 --> 38:28.260
Yeah.

38:28.260 --> 38:30.220
What used to be guaranteed.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.260
It's still near and dear to my heart.

38:32.260 --> 38:33.980
Um, it's so dear to your heart.

38:33.980 --> 38:35.580
It just keeps breaking it.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.580
Yeah.

38:36.580 --> 38:40.100
Oh, so Rockstar basically confirmed a lot of things that we kind of already assumed

38:40.100 --> 38:42.340
with their actions.

38:42.340 --> 38:46.100
I mean, that's just kind of the way they've been treating things.

38:46.100 --> 38:52.780
So they've confirmed that, um, major red dead online or red dead online support is done.

38:52.780 --> 38:55.380
I mean, let's be honest, it's been done for months already.

38:55.380 --> 39:00.180
They haven't really supported it at all because their cash cow grand theft auto online is

39:00.180 --> 39:04.420
been making a ton of money and that's where they're putting their effort.

39:04.420 --> 39:08.500
So they said, you know, over the past few years, we've steadily moving towards development

39:08.500 --> 39:13.380
resources towards the entry of the next entry in the grand theft auto series.

39:13.380 --> 39:18.660
Understanding that, um, more than ever, the need to exceed players expectations for this

39:18.660 --> 39:21.940
next century can be the best as possibly can be.

39:21.940 --> 39:26.420
Um, and as a result, we are in the process of making some changes in how we support red

39:26.420 --> 39:27.420
dead online.

39:27.660 --> 39:32.780
Let's be honest, like they haven't like provided updates to red dead online for like a long

39:32.780 --> 39:37.300
time and it's certainly not supported the same way as grand theft auto online.

39:37.300 --> 39:40.900
So sure, we'll just say that they're doing that.

39:40.900 --> 39:45.340
Um, and then of course they're also shelving some other remakes.

39:45.340 --> 39:50.780
So this one really is super disappointing for me because I was a huge fan of grand theft

39:50.780 --> 39:51.780
auto four.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.500
Uh, it's where I played all my modded games and stuff.

39:54.500 --> 39:59.980
They were going to do a remaster grand theft auto four and of the original red dead redemption.

39:59.980 --> 40:06.940
But they said that, um, allegedly do the insider sources that these are no longer on the table,

40:06.940 --> 40:13.660
uh, because of the mess that grand theft auto, um, the trilogy went through.

40:13.660 --> 40:16.940
I mean, but are they surprised?

40:16.940 --> 40:22.300
I mean, like they didn't put a lot of effort into the trilogy and they're surprised that

40:22.300 --> 40:23.620
it like blew up at them.

40:23.620 --> 40:28.100
Like, I mean, they're really going to put the same amount of effort and let's have like,

40:28.100 --> 40:32.980
I was going to ask if the four remake was in the same boat as the trilogy, it probably

40:32.980 --> 40:34.180
would have pissed you off.

40:34.180 --> 40:35.180
You wouldn't have been happy.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.540
Oh, it would have absolutely pissed me off.

40:37.540 --> 40:41.820
But like I still would have liked to see a re oh, I'd like to see a remake of that.

40:41.820 --> 40:46.020
It would be nice, but I just, if they're not going to put any effort into it, which I don't

40:46.020 --> 40:50.440
understand why they have the resources, they make so many billions of dollars off of grand

40:50.440 --> 40:51.440
theft auto.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.600
I mean, five has been out forever.

40:53.600 --> 40:57.000
I don't understand why they couldn't do that, but all right.

40:57.000 --> 41:02.740
I mean, if you really don't want to put the effort behind it, then I guess it's better

41:02.740 --> 41:03.740
not to come out.

41:03.740 --> 41:08.680
Fifth dream in chat says grand theft auto six will never meet gamers expectations.

41:08.680 --> 41:11.920
Do you think the bar is too high for GTA six?

41:11.920 --> 41:14.760
Um, yeah, it is.

41:14.760 --> 41:19.680
I think it's, it's never going to, I think, I think the problem with GTA six and I don't

41:19.680 --> 41:21.360
even play these games as much as you do.

41:21.360 --> 41:25.900
And I fully admit that Loki, but I think the problem with GTA six is going to be the pressure

41:25.900 --> 41:30.640
to make something that continues the online side of things.

41:30.640 --> 41:33.940
Because like you said, that's where they're raking in the billions.

41:33.940 --> 41:35.180
That is what's going to happen.

41:35.180 --> 41:40.960
So here's what I see with GTA six is like, it'll never single player wise, it's never

41:40.960 --> 41:47.500
going to live up to it because it's it going from like four to five, it was just such a

41:47.500 --> 41:52.540
massive like the world was so much bigger and so much more in depth and stuff.

41:52.540 --> 41:56.540
You just can't, you can't really go much further with it.

41:56.540 --> 42:00.980
Like you can't make it even more in depth and larger.

42:00.980 --> 42:05.600
I don't know how big of a world they can really make with that kind of detail.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.740
It would have been nice.

42:06.740 --> 42:10.520
The thought was originally with grand theft auto six that was going to be a different

42:10.520 --> 42:15.500
location and that that would somehow tie into grand theft auto online or that grand theft

42:15.500 --> 42:20.820
auto online would keep expanding to like, you know, we'd go to Liberty City and we would

42:20.820 --> 42:26.100
go to Vice City and then maybe new locations that they'd never come up with and you have

42:26.100 --> 42:28.760
it where you that would all kind of interconnect together.

42:28.760 --> 42:34.340
But I don't know, I'll still play it.

42:34.340 --> 42:41.260
But it's, it's gonna be like micro transaction to hell, you know, for grant, whatever grand

42:41.260 --> 42:47.580
theft auto online to is it's going to be just an absolute slog as far as pushing those

42:47.580 --> 42:50.740
micro transactions, because that's where they made so much money.

42:50.740 --> 42:54.980
I mean, the people have voted with their wallets, so

42:54.980 --> 42:57.460
Zen monkey 11 says GTA six will be epic.

42:57.460 --> 43:02.420
Rockstar always comes through, you know, let's, let's, let's, it'd be nice to see something.

43:02.420 --> 43:03.420
That's all it's been.

43:03.420 --> 43:04.420
It's been a while.

43:04.420 --> 43:05.420
It's been a while.

43:05.420 --> 43:06.420
Yeah.

43:06.420 --> 43:07.420
Like, let's put it this way.

43:07.420 --> 43:08.420
Like the single player probably is going to be good.

43:08.420 --> 43:14.540
Like because Red Dead Redemption two was a great single player experience.

43:14.540 --> 43:19.520
I just like I'm still disappointed that five never had any single player DLC like as four

43:19.520 --> 43:25.700
had two really great pieces of single player DLC that were, it really fit that game.

43:25.700 --> 43:30.820
Like I would love to see something like that, but I don't know.

43:30.820 --> 43:31.820
We'll see.

43:31.820 --> 43:37.560
SGA 100 Matt in chat says GTA blockchain confirmed.

43:37.560 --> 43:38.560
Please know.

43:38.560 --> 43:39.560
I don't think so.

43:39.560 --> 43:43.100
But like, you're not.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.620
Please do not.

43:44.620 --> 43:48.700
Let's move on and talk because I don't, I don't know if crypto is treating this company

43:48.700 --> 43:54.060
very well, but there's, unfortunately, I think what a lot of us knew was probably gonna happen

43:54.060 --> 43:58.540
eventually started to happen over at GameStop and, but, but I mean, I'm going to start off

43:58.540 --> 43:59.540
with this.

43:59.540 --> 44:01.660
An executive gets laid off.

44:01.660 --> 44:08.820
So the chief financial officer of GameStop, Mike Recupero has been fired.

44:08.820 --> 44:11.860
And along with that, some mass layoffs.

44:11.860 --> 44:17.500
An email that went out from CEO Matt Furlong said that these reductions are to help the

44:17.500 --> 44:24.920
company operate more nimbly while they pursue profitability through an intense owner's mentality.

44:24.920 --> 44:26.580
I'm not sure totally what that means.

44:26.580 --> 44:31.140
I'm assuming it's gaming culture and how you walk into GameStop now and it's like Funko

44:31.140 --> 44:33.400
Pops shirt, things like that.

44:33.400 --> 44:36.020
It's not just games like it used to be.

44:36.020 --> 44:41.180
The first line of the email read, change will be a constant as we evolve our commerce business

44:41.180 --> 44:44.660
and launch new products through our blockchain group.

44:44.660 --> 44:45.660
Sorry.

44:45.660 --> 44:46.660
Sorry.

44:46.660 --> 44:52.420
It's so sad to see them like pivoting towards this considering what's going on in the crypto

44:52.420 --> 44:53.420
space.

44:54.260 --> 44:56.900
I was like, dude, do you not read the internet?

44:56.900 --> 44:57.900
Do you not?

44:57.900 --> 44:58.900
Do you not have phones?

44:58.900 --> 44:59.900
Like what?

44:59.900 --> 45:00.900
All right.

45:00.900 --> 45:01.900
Yeah.

45:01.900 --> 45:02.900
I'm sure.

45:02.900 --> 45:08.660
I'm sure you'll be different, but while the layoffs seem to be mostly focused at the headquarters

45:08.660 --> 45:12.960
in Texas, it's important to point out that some of the staff at Game Informer, which

45:12.960 --> 45:16.860
of course is the magazine that's been around forever from GameStop, I'm surprised that's

45:16.860 --> 45:17.860
still around.

45:17.860 --> 45:18.860
Yeah.

45:18.860 --> 45:22.180
But unfortunately, uh, the, some of that staff was laid off as well.

45:22.180 --> 45:24.580
So who knows what that means for the future of the magazine?

45:24.580 --> 45:29.740
Um, and that's always sad because, you know, I think a lot of us old timers sit there and

45:29.740 --> 45:33.080
go, damn magazines used to be so cool.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.140
And then we just, oh, you want to hire us.

45:35.140 --> 45:36.580
Another one, another one.

45:36.580 --> 45:39.660
I went, I went to a Barnes and Noble the other day.

45:39.660 --> 45:40.660
Oh no.

45:40.660 --> 45:42.900
And I walked over, I walked over.

45:42.900 --> 45:43.900
Yeah.

45:43.900 --> 45:44.900
Yeah.

45:44.900 --> 45:45.900
They still exist.

45:45.900 --> 45:46.900
Uh, they closed super early now.

45:46.900 --> 45:49.700
Um, but I went over to, uh, the magazine section.

45:49.700 --> 45:52.420
I was like, oh, I'm gonna like for gaming magazines.

45:52.420 --> 45:53.420
Yep.

45:53.420 --> 45:54.420
They weren't there.

45:54.420 --> 45:58.860
They had, I think it may have like a retro magazine or something like that, the one import

45:58.860 --> 46:04.240
from Europe, like a retro magazine from Europe, I think it's like, I thought that retro gamer

46:04.240 --> 46:05.240
was over.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.500
Oh, I used to get that.

46:07.500 --> 46:09.700
Maybe it wasn't necessarily a retro gamer.

46:09.700 --> 46:13.460
Like a lot of them aren't necessarily magazines like issue magazines.

46:13.460 --> 46:18.220
A lot of them will do like, it's a retro gaming spectacular magazine where it like just covers

46:18.220 --> 46:19.220
like retro games.

46:19.740 --> 46:21.420
And it's like a one-off type thing.

46:21.420 --> 46:22.740
So they'll have those.

46:22.740 --> 46:27.020
Um, I did find it funny though that 2,600 still has a magazine coming out.

46:27.020 --> 46:28.020
That's that's funny.

46:28.020 --> 46:35.940
Um, but yeah, no, it was sad to see like no gaming magazines anymore.

46:35.940 --> 46:38.100
So it is what it is.

46:38.100 --> 46:39.100
Uh, interesting.

46:39.100 --> 46:42.980
Bobby is talking about, uh, his trip to Minneapolis for summer games done quick and some of the

46:42.980 --> 46:44.260
sightseeing around there.

46:44.260 --> 46:48.780
Bobby in our chat says, when I visited the museum of consumerism in Minneapolis, better

46:48.820 --> 46:56.540
known as the mall of America, uh, the GameStop was actually called GameStop pop culture.

46:56.540 --> 47:05.780
So is that pop culture as in Funko pop culture, when's the, when's the dam going to burst

47:05.780 --> 47:06.780
on those things?

47:06.780 --> 47:10.540
Like, I feel like those things are everywhere and they're not going, you know, it's the

47:10.540 --> 47:11.860
beanie babies that won't go away.

47:11.860 --> 47:12.860
I guess so.

47:12.860 --> 47:15.860
And look, I, before you all labeled me a hater, I'm not a hater.

47:15.860 --> 47:19.140
Look, I have pop, I'm not going to reach up there, but I have pop figures that are

47:19.140 --> 47:20.140
way up here.

47:20.140 --> 47:25.260
I have my Mass Effect Andromeda ones up here, uh, uh, Sarah Ryder and Liam Costa are up

47:25.260 --> 47:26.260
there.

47:26.260 --> 47:33.140
Um, but like, so I, yeah, I do have some, but I, I still can't, my God, they're everywhere,

47:33.140 --> 47:34.140
everywhere.

47:34.140 --> 47:36.980
And actually, do you know what's in my office?

47:36.980 --> 47:41.600
Do you know what's way cooler than any Funko pop I own?

47:41.600 --> 47:46.400
The Spice Girls Legos I just got on my last trip to the Galleria last week.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.400
Yeah, that's right.

47:47.400 --> 47:48.400
I forgot those are coming out.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.660
The Spice Girls Legos.

47:50.660 --> 47:54.760
I I'm going to have to do this next week is, is too much for me at work to do it, but I

47:54.760 --> 47:58.200
think maybe in two weeks I'll do a creative stream and I'll build those on stream.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.480
I think that'll be fun.

48:00.480 --> 48:04.400
So I'll tell you what I want, whatever they want.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.760
It's more Spice Girls Legos.

48:05.760 --> 48:06.760
That's for sure.

48:06.760 --> 48:10.200
Actually, there's so many cool like Lego stuff now.

48:10.200 --> 48:16.200
Like damn, like, like between the, cause when I was in the store, um, they had a Sonic

48:16.200 --> 48:17.400
stuff.

48:17.400 --> 48:18.800
They had all the Mario stuff.

48:18.800 --> 48:21.040
I know there's a story coming up later on that Mario stuff.

48:21.040 --> 48:23.480
I won't spoil it, but I think y'all know what I'm talking about.

48:23.480 --> 48:24.480
There's that.

48:24.480 --> 48:27.000
Like there's a lot of cool ass Lego stuff right now.

48:27.000 --> 48:32.680
They keep, I keep seeing the question block and I'm like, yeah, it's so expensive.

48:32.680 --> 48:33.980
I don't, I don't need it.

48:33.980 --> 48:36.360
And I also see, I keep seeing the Queer Eye set.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.000
I just don't like the television.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Oh yeah.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Queer Eye set.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
It's um, they have that.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.360
They have, they have a bunch of like TV shows.

48:42.360 --> 48:49.880
They have Seinfeld, Friends, they had two Friends sets, uh, Queer Eye and well, way

48:49.880 --> 48:56.300
back they had, uh, the big bang, big bang theory, but, um, yeah, there's a lot of sets

48:56.300 --> 48:59.800
or I look every week, but like all the time I'm like, nope, nope.

48:59.800 --> 49:00.800
I don't need that.

49:00.800 --> 49:04.440
We never got our drag race Lego set even though it got the voting thing.

49:04.440 --> 49:07.080
But anyway, yeah, it's licensing.

49:07.080 --> 49:09.840
Well, they need to figure it out cause we need drag race.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.880
Like, come on, we need the work room in a Lego set.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.160
Come on.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.160
They have a new one though.

49:15.160 --> 49:22.660
That not Lego necessarily, but uh, Mega constructs has a new Pikachu that actually is, it has

49:22.660 --> 49:25.360
a crank and it does the animation of running.

49:25.360 --> 49:28.860
I was just saying, are they the Lego clone that have the Pokemon license?

49:28.860 --> 49:29.860
Because we were all, they are.

49:29.860 --> 49:30.860
Yeah.

49:30.860 --> 49:36.380
I haven't, I hadn't been to the mall in a while and there's a lot of like, like Japanese

49:36.380 --> 49:40.820
import type of stores now between like Daiso, Miniso and like other, like there were at

49:40.820 --> 49:44.420
least two or three other like collectible stores like that, but they had a ton of like

49:44.420 --> 49:45.420
Pokemon really.

49:45.420 --> 49:46.420
I sent Shane a picture.

49:46.420 --> 49:47.900
I was like, did you know these exist?

49:47.900 --> 49:52.820
So I need to go to Miniso cause I've actually gotten really good storage saver stuff from

49:52.820 --> 49:53.820
their site online.

49:53.820 --> 49:54.820
Oh yeah.

49:54.820 --> 49:56.460
Mega constructs also had Halo.

49:56.460 --> 49:57.700
They also had destiny.

49:57.700 --> 50:00.740
In fact, I still have a destiny.

50:00.740 --> 50:02.620
It's like, I don't know what they call them.

50:02.620 --> 50:09.620
I know in Lego terms, it's the, um, Oh gosh, it's the block heads.

50:09.620 --> 50:11.640
It's like blocks on the, I don't know.

50:11.640 --> 50:16.480
It's a little like kind of the Funko pop version of Lego characters.

50:16.480 --> 50:17.480
I don't remember.

50:17.480 --> 50:18.480
They call brickheads.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.480
That's right.

50:19.480 --> 50:24.260
And um, so whatever the mega constructs equivalent of that would be for destiny, I have one of

50:24.260 --> 50:25.260
those.

50:25.260 --> 50:27.380
Um, it was, these were all stuff.

50:27.380 --> 50:28.380
I got it.

50:28.380 --> 50:38.740
Um, but yeah, they have a lot of unique licenses.

50:38.740 --> 50:40.420
Hot Wheels is one that they have right now.

50:40.420 --> 50:45.020
They have like hot, big old Hot Wheels cars you can make, um, I don't know.

50:45.020 --> 50:46.020
Very exciting stuff.

50:46.020 --> 50:47.020
Yeah.

50:47.020 --> 50:51.280
Anyway, my advice to GameStop, uh, more spice girls, less crypto, but as long as you keep

50:51.280 --> 50:58.100
marching to this crypto thing, like rip, honestly, so, all right, moving on, uh, things to look

50:58.140 --> 51:02.140
forward to Dark Sakura.

51:02.140 --> 51:06.220
And those among those things is a game that's being remade.

51:06.220 --> 51:08.820
And yes, everyone's like, yay, more remakes.

51:08.820 --> 51:14.500
This one was a, I don't know, kind of a sleeper at first, a lollipop chainsaw.

51:14.500 --> 51:20.340
There is going to be a rerelease for this in, uh, 2023.

51:21.300 --> 51:28.180
It will have, uh, more, um, it actually is going to employ some of the previous staff

51:28.180 --> 51:34.780
that worked on it and some newer staff and have quote more realistic and quote visuals.

51:34.780 --> 51:39.540
It will have a new soundtrack because of licensing issues.

51:39.700 --> 51:50.220
The big thing before that, um, is that, uh, there's a, uh, a quote on here from, uh, Yasuda

51:50.220 --> 51:54.380
Yoshimi, who was the original games producer.

51:54.380 --> 51:59.660
Um, unfortunately, various factors resulted in things making it so that fans can no longer

51:59.660 --> 52:01.800
easily play lollipop chainsaw.

52:01.800 --> 52:06.960
And it has been sometime since players have not been able to access the game on current

52:06.960 --> 52:07.960
consoles.

52:08.440 --> 52:15.560
In fact, this is absent, uh, from the Xbox backward compatibility list.

52:15.560 --> 52:17.880
Um, the theory is it because of the music.

52:17.880 --> 52:24.360
Um, so to continue the quote, um, we, the original development staff on lollipop chainsaw,

52:24.360 --> 52:29.320
think of the game as very precious to us and did, and did not want to leave it in limbo

52:29.320 --> 52:31.920
where players who want to play it cannot.

52:31.920 --> 52:37.280
As such, we purchased the lollipop chainsaw intellectual properties from, uh, Kadokawa

52:37.280 --> 52:41.600
games and decided to develop a remake.

52:41.600 --> 52:47.480
Our goal is to make it easier for game, for games who want to play, I guess it means gamers

52:47.480 --> 52:49.280
who want to play lollipop chainsaw to do so.

52:49.280 --> 52:52.120
Please look forward to the games 2023 release.

52:52.120 --> 52:59.440
So basically, uh, you play a underdressed cheerleader with her boyfriend's head attached

52:59.440 --> 53:02.800
to her waist who kills somehow.

53:02.800 --> 53:03.800
Yeah.

53:03.800 --> 53:10.360
They're alive somehow and you chop them up.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.800
It's weird.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.080
As you should do to ex boyfriends.

53:13.080 --> 53:14.840
Very mixed reviews on this game.

53:14.840 --> 53:15.840
Yeah.

53:15.840 --> 53:16.840
No, it wasn't her ex.

53:16.840 --> 53:18.280
I think he was just like her love interest.

53:18.280 --> 53:19.280
Oh, interesting.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.280
Oh, okay.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.280
Hmm.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.280
Yeah.

53:22.280 --> 53:25.840
I have to admit, I didn't really spend any time with it, but, um, I know it's kind of

53:25.840 --> 53:29.720
a, uh, I guess cult classic could be the word thing you call it.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
Yeah.

53:30.720 --> 53:32.720
So, all right.

53:32.720 --> 53:37.000
I'll, I'll have to see what this remakes all about when the trailer, uh, comes out.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Watch a play through of the game at some point.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.040
You will just go, what did I watch?

53:41.040 --> 53:42.040
What?

53:42.040 --> 53:46.920
Uh, as soon as you went to Matt and chat says, yeah, James Gunn and Suda 51 said they only

53:46.920 --> 53:51.280
found out about this a few weeks ago as these remake things tend to go sometimes.

53:51.280 --> 53:56.560
Uh, and that's true of Hollywood as well as, you know, video games clearly.

53:56.560 --> 54:02.680
So all right, well, uh, what is a new console that we won't be playing?

54:02.680 --> 54:06.440
We won't be playing this remake on Loki.

54:06.440 --> 54:11.240
So it's the newest scam console, the polium, a polium one.

54:11.240 --> 54:16.640
It is bringing all of your favorite things in the gaming industry together.

54:16.640 --> 54:23.680
Web 3.0 NFTs, the blockchain, and it's going to do amazing things like throw out specs

54:23.680 --> 54:25.720
that it can't possibly hit.

54:25.720 --> 54:32.440
It's going to be eight K, 120 FPS and ray tracing and it's going to, it's going to include

54:32.440 --> 54:36.440
touch ID, which is somehow that's wholly owned by Apple.

54:36.440 --> 54:41.520
So I don't know how that's possible, but it's, it's going to combine your wallets and it's

54:41.520 --> 54:46.840
like somebody literally wrote every buzzword on a whiteboard and then said, okay, now put

54:46.840 --> 54:49.840
that in a press release to raise funds.

54:49.840 --> 54:53.140
Basically, yeah.

54:53.140 --> 54:58.200
So they have like a roadmap and there's a bunch of other nonsense with it.

54:58.200 --> 55:03.020
You have to buy, it's basically an elaborate rug pull is what it is because you have to

55:03.020 --> 55:07.160
buy an NFT to like purchase the console.

55:07.160 --> 55:11.120
But what's going to happen is you're going to buy all these NFTs and then they're going

55:11.120 --> 55:14.340
to rug pull it and then you're stuck with NFTs that are worth nothing.

55:14.340 --> 55:16.880
So keep it up.

55:16.880 --> 55:21.920
But not only that, they came up with a very unoriginal logo, which sort of looks like

55:21.920 --> 55:23.540
the GameCube logo.

55:23.540 --> 55:31.860
It also ends up looking like logos for Pebble Host, which is a hosting company for the Minecraft

55:31.860 --> 55:34.580
server I play on.

55:34.580 --> 55:35.780
Exactly the same logo.

55:35.780 --> 55:39.220
So yeah, just don't trust it.

55:39.220 --> 55:46.140
It is, it is the 2022 Phantom or Amico, however you want to put that.

55:46.140 --> 55:50.940
Well, I was going to say, which of these consoles are we more likely to see this web three console

55:50.940 --> 55:54.380
or the Amico?

55:54.380 --> 55:55.380
At this point?

55:55.380 --> 55:59.780
You know, at this point, a console for me would be the one that's most likely to come

55:59.780 --> 56:04.420
out is honestly like, I don't know.

56:04.420 --> 56:06.260
I don't think any of this stuff's coming out.

56:06.260 --> 56:12.340
There's only one way why YR could truly up his game.

56:12.340 --> 56:13.340
Game console?

56:13.340 --> 56:14.340
No.

56:14.340 --> 56:18.300
Then we don't need a game console, especially like the stuff with the web three stuff that

56:18.300 --> 56:19.300
they're talking about.

56:20.300 --> 56:21.300
So what's it going to do?

56:21.300 --> 56:23.460
It's going to run like HTML five games.

56:23.460 --> 56:25.980
Like, why do I need a console for that?

56:25.980 --> 56:27.460
Just do that through a PC.

56:27.460 --> 56:28.460
Do that through your phone.

56:28.460 --> 56:30.340
Like, why do I need a console for that?

56:30.340 --> 56:31.540
What games are going to be on?

56:31.540 --> 56:34.780
Oh, we're talking with people about getting games.

56:34.780 --> 56:37.460
No, no, thank you.

56:37.460 --> 56:38.460
Don't need.

56:38.460 --> 56:39.900
Yeah, I have.

56:39.900 --> 56:43.140
I will say this until I'm blue in the face.

56:43.140 --> 56:51.060
Crypto games are going to be gar, budge, garbage until they ever are able to partner into an

56:51.060 --> 56:52.260
existing franchise.

56:52.260 --> 56:53.260
That is big.

56:53.260 --> 56:54.260
Like I said, Pokemon.

56:54.260 --> 56:55.600
You want to make NFTs popular?

56:55.600 --> 56:56.940
Do you want people to talk about NFTs?

56:56.940 --> 56:59.780
Do you want everybody to go fucking crazy about NFTs?

56:59.780 --> 57:03.180
Get the Pokemon company on board until that happens.

57:03.180 --> 57:07.100
It's it's like shovelware games are the types of games.

57:07.100 --> 57:08.100
NFTs anyway.

57:08.100 --> 57:09.100
Yeah.

57:09.100 --> 57:12.020
So it's just, yeah.

57:12.060 --> 57:13.900
Stop trying to make NFTs happen.

57:13.900 --> 57:14.900
It's not happening.

57:14.900 --> 57:17.060
And it just blows my mind again.

57:17.060 --> 57:21.660
Again, it goes back to the ape NFT things where I'm like, what?

57:21.660 --> 57:22.980
Why are that?

57:22.980 --> 57:26.780
Why is that what you're trying to sell me NFTs with?

57:26.780 --> 57:29.300
I mean, yikes.

57:29.300 --> 57:34.740
Anyway, if you're going to make an NFT, make it pretty.

57:34.740 --> 57:37.620
Questmaster in chat says, what titles are slated for this?

57:37.620 --> 57:39.780
Repeats blockchain variants that can be built into games.

57:39.780 --> 57:40.780
No, no, no.

57:40.780 --> 57:42.140
Games can I look forward to?

57:42.140 --> 57:43.140
It's not it's not there.

57:43.140 --> 57:44.140
It's not there.

57:44.140 --> 57:45.860
It's not there.

57:45.860 --> 57:46.860
That's funny.

57:46.860 --> 57:47.860
They say games.

57:47.860 --> 57:53.740
I mean, because it's it's about it's about blockchain and the crypto and you know who

57:53.740 --> 57:55.740
get in bed on with this.

57:55.740 --> 58:01.060
It's a company that's just real ready to jump into the whole crypto space.

58:01.060 --> 58:02.740
And they're looking for a new game console.

58:02.740 --> 58:03.740
That'd be GameStop.

58:03.740 --> 58:07.380
I was gonna say GameStop is going to back this.

58:07.380 --> 58:10.060
There's saving grace.

58:10.060 --> 58:11.060
It's going to happen.

58:11.060 --> 58:12.060
Yeah.

58:12.060 --> 58:13.940
Just like being extra failure.

58:13.940 --> 58:17.740
No, you insert Funko Pops in order to power the console.

58:17.740 --> 58:23.200
It just it shreds Funko Pops and feeds off their souls.

58:23.200 --> 58:24.200
That's where you're wrong.

58:24.200 --> 58:27.380
There's no souls in Funko Pops.

58:27.380 --> 58:35.460
All right, moving on to a console that might get a little more love to help it play games

58:35.460 --> 58:37.660
from an older console.

58:37.660 --> 58:41.180
It's the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 3 emulation.

58:41.180 --> 58:45.820
And you might be saying, but Rob, the PlayStation 5 can already play PlayStation 3 games, but

58:45.820 --> 58:47.540
only through the cloud.

58:47.540 --> 58:54.840
That is how the the PlayStation Plus service and its new like, you know, old games library.

58:54.840 --> 58:55.840
That's how it works.

58:55.840 --> 59:00.260
It's all through the cloud for PS3, for PS1 and 2, you can download them, but for PS3,

59:00.260 --> 59:01.260
it's all through the cloud.

59:01.260 --> 59:08.100
However, apparently the eagle eyed folks over on the Reset Era forums found a new job

59:08.100 --> 59:14.180
ad that is suggesting that Sony is getting an engineer to get PlayStation 3 emulation

59:14.180 --> 59:17.840
existing on the PlayStation 5.

59:17.840 --> 59:22.820
From the job posting said our software development engineer position works on the tools and technology

59:22.820 --> 59:28.800
team at PlayStation Studios to support the newly relaunched classics for PS4 and PS5.

59:28.800 --> 59:32.160
Classic games run via emulation of legacy PlayStation platforms.

59:32.160 --> 59:36.620
As a classics engineer, you would work closely with a group of other engineers, producers

59:36.620 --> 59:42.200
and QA teams to fix bugs, add new features and develop new emulators.

59:42.200 --> 59:47.720
That's the part that's getting everybody up in arms because what's the only emulator they

59:47.720 --> 59:50.700
still need a PlayStation 3 one.

59:50.700 --> 59:55.620
So because it's not like this thing is going to emulate Super Nintendo.

59:55.620 --> 59:59.780
I mean, that would be cool, but I mean, it takes a lot of that's literally the only other

59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.740
system that Sony has.

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:08.140
I can't think of any other systems that they would need to emulate on the PlayStation.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:12.580
The PSP data, the PSP must be the Vita.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.580
What's that?

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.180
I don't think Sony knows what a Vita is now.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:22.480
They clearly don't know they they they've tried to erase that from history and all of

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.480
our memories.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.240
It's all about the back touch panel, because that's where we need the touch panel to be

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.400
on the backside of a console.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:40.520
Um, let's see, um, in chat, Zen Monkey says, Please don't ruin the PS5 with PS3 nonsense.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.160
Not seeing how that I mean, an extra feature is not going to take away from any existing

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.160
feature.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.680
So I'd be curious about that.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:52.400
I don't understand any logic in that, sorry.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.920
And victoryman chat says, ahem, we need Vita.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.160
Yeah, we do need Vita.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.160
That's for sure.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.240
Orange Wright says PS mobile clearly.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.080
Oh, that's the one that's the one forgot about.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:08.520
But that would be good because if we get PlayStation mobile, then that means we could have pixel

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.040
poops on the PlayStation five.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:18.440
Because that that was the Vita's like arm of that was the PS mobile stuff on the Vita

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.440
shop, right?

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:25.080
Yeah, that was the kind of like, you know, you can make your own you can self published on

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.800
the PlayStation Store type thing.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.040
Yeah, I'll be curious to see what happens to that.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.560
All right, let's go to our next story.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.360
Oh, by the way, Zen Monkey did follow up with a comment saying resources spent on old crap

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.240
slows down work on the new stuff.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.680
I do understand that whole there's only so many pieces of the pie to go around.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.240
But remember, this story is coming from a new job posting.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.880
So it is possible Sony is adding the resources to deal with this to not take away from

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.560
anything else. I think that's worth considering.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.360
So but anyhow, let's shift gears here.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.040
This is kind of more of a special interest story, but I think this is neat.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:01.640
Dark Sakura.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:13.040
So, well, I think it's also kind of interesting that this is a government thing, but the

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:20.400
State Department has been pushing for a diplomacy program for game design.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:29.160
So it did its first school last last month, that would be in June, 450 students from

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:36.320
across U.S., Israel, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain did a 10 week program called the

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:42.640
Game Exchange and completed a total of 170 new video games that were based off of the

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.320
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:53.000
So if you're unfamiliar with what those goals are, they're also called the Global Goals

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:59.200
adopted by the UN in 2015 as a call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:03.080
ensure that by 2030, all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.760
So there's many different things that that involves.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:13.520
But going back to this, basically the participants were in up to three video

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:22.240
conference calls with their international compatriots there, and they were at a sister

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.880
school that was in addition to seven or eight sessions.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:29.880
So a total between 20 to 25 hours among themselves.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.240
So the teachers also involved in that were paid to help navigate through the game

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:44.920
development process. So the goal is to foster long term relations while teaching

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.920
them how to make games.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:51.760
So the Game Exchange received a grant from the Stevens Initiative, which is funded by

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.760
the U.S. State Department and the Bezos Family Foundation.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.840
Yeah, Bezos.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:05.200
That is Jackie Bezos, the president and co-founder of the Bezos Family Foundation, who

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.040
is Jeff Bezos' mother, who also owns The Washington Post.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.000
At any rate, they want to double the number of students next year.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:22.640
They're still working on a quantitative analysis of the program, but they think that

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.880
this is going to be a really good way to facilitate person to person diplomacy on

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.480
issues like climate change, gender equity and food security, especially among the

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:40.760
younger generation. The acting deputy assistant secretary for professional and

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.480
cultural exchanges for the U.S.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:48.000
Department of State, that's Chris Minor, is quoted saying the virtual exchange is the

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.880
beginning of what we hope to be a lasting relationship that moves beyond gaming.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.880
Students were really positive on it.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.040
They wanted more opportunities to interact with other students and go abroad during the

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:12.600
program. And there's a couple of people like a 16-year-old who said that they'd never

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.600
met someone outside of the country except from Canada.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:24.400
And she was interested in it because she had been a Fortnite player after the pandemic

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.680
started and wanted to make her own games.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:32.280
But she said that she wasn't sure that the cross-cultural aspect was going to work.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:38.880
And then it changed when one of the Israeli students said, shit.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.640
And then they're like, oh, you talk like we do.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.080
All right, we're all we're all kids.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.200
We all kind of deal with the same stuff.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:53.200
And I don't know, just took one little thing, but everyone's like, yeah, we're on this

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.000
same the same wavelength on here.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.760
So is this about diplomacy through video games or just diplomacy through bad words?

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:09.440
I don't know, but it was the getting together and trying something new.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:15.720
But they also learned a lot about the background of game development and about the

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.960
background of each other.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:25.960
One of one of the Israeli students was basically like he wanted to connect with

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.120
American kids through gaming and sports and music.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.720
He said he's a fan of basketball.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:37.080
He was a fan of the Detroit Pistons and he knows the Kiss song, Detroit Rock City.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.480
And other than that, he didn't have any expectations about the Detroit students, but

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.640
they worked together and had fun.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.480
I think that's good.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.680
Yeah, I think it's neat.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.920
You know, it's, you know, the thing that isn't so explicitly pointed out by this article

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:56.680
is that video games are art and it's it's people bonding.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.920
And it's it's, you know, the world coming together through art and being able to speak

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.160
that common language.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.520
And I think that's really neat.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:11.840
Well, actually, that is sort of mentioned in there is that they the big thing was they

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:16.720
wanted to create the games and share the culture and that the culture was the bonding

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:22.000
point and that that would help them build the friendships with other people in the world.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.360
Well, I mean, best of best of luck to them in their development efforts and so forth, I

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.520
look forward to seeing, you know, what they what they all come up with when they put their

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.160
heads together. So it's already happened.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.400
So we'll see what next year brings.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.560
Cool. All right.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:41.480
Let's move on, Loki.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.360
With a follow up of sorts.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:52.600
Yes. So you may remember that EA made some really stupid tweets the other week was the

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.600
other week. Geez, I don't even know it anymore.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.440
It was June 30th.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.480
OK, so, yeah, I was about two weeks ago, a week and a half talking about single player

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.560
games and how like there are there are 10, but only like playing single player games.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.680
And everyone's like, you've killed so many single player games, you jerks.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:17.760
And so apparently because of that, you know, devs are angry at them and it's also caused

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.080
roundtable meetings with staff kind of saying, what the hell are you doing?

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:29.440
Stupid. You know, basically they said the most agreed on idea was to take responsibility

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.920
for it and apologize.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.640
However, instead, they decided to post, you know, roast.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:39.800
Well deserved. We'll take the L because playing single player games actually makes them an

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.960
11. God, that's so cringe.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.320
Like, stop.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.960
Just don't pretend.

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.440
Just say, you know what?

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.120
Sorry. Yeah, we understand how you may have taken offense to that.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.080
I have done.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.080
Hello, fellow teenagers.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.400
I have better advice.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.800
Delete your account.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.640
That's my advice. Delete your account.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:05.360
They're saying that a lot of the folks that are running the EA like social network, they said

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:10.960
they're I'm not I'm not or I'm 99 percent sure that the person who posted the tweet and their

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.400
manager don't even know about single player games comment from a decade ago.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:22.080
It says also that the source of further sources are saying that the staff were in a Twitter

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:28.320
account are all new and most of them aren't really game industry people and likely had no idea

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.040
about EA's long, bad history with single player games.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:32.880
Congrats.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.200
You played yourself.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.480
I I don't even know what else to say like that.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.360
Just what a bad fucking decision from the very top that was.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:47.880
And I that's stop trying to place the blame on somebody who is trying to come in and do their

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.000
job. You know, you wanted to hire somebody new with not a lot of gaming background because they

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.600
were cheap. Who is would hop on these trends?

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.840
You know what? They did what they were asked to do.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:03.160
You made the mistake of and did I hear that they were like naughty, like they were an outsource

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.200
company potentially, too. They weren't even EA employees.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.240
I don't even know. But like, like, why even tweet that in the first place?

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:15.520
There are 10, but they only like playing it was a stupid Twitter trend that was going on.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:16.680
I understand that.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.840
But like, do we need corporations to get in on Twitter trends?

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:27.760
Really ask RadioShack or RadioShack isn't really RadioShack anymore.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.520
Wendy's.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.520
I'll give you Wendy's.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.120
But yeah.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:31.440
Okay.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.400
DJ Rama says it was an outsize company.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.640
That's again, like I said, it's completely then you played yourself and these executives got

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.920
exactly what they deserved.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.080
Period.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.720
Have some good advice to them.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.120
Don't delete your account.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.640
That's my advice.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.680
Just just don't don't do anything.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.200
Just let it don't even delete it.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.400
Just let it sit fallow.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.080
Let it decompose.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.520
I don't know. Just don't don't anymore.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.200
As Joe 100 Matt says, if it was a third party contractor sending this out, shouldn't you as the

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.000
company approved said copy?

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.600
A very, very excellent point.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.600
Not if they don't care.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.360
That's what we hired them for.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.240
Let them do it.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:21.120
Yeah.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:22.560
All right.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.840
This is our next story.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.920
This is some people's worst nightmare when it comes to digital content.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.600
And it's just coming true.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.480
And this has to do with PlayStation.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.600
But I will stress this is not in the US.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.320
This is happening overseas.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:46.240
It's the German and Austrian versions of PSN have lost movies from Studio Canal or I should say

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.920
they will be removed on August 31st.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.120
But here's the thing.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.200
It doesn't just apply to 100 films that were available for purchase on the PlayStation Store.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.440
But if you previously purchased this, you can no longer access the film after August 31st.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.760
And there's a lot of like big movies that are a part of this.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:14.320
If I were to actually go to a list of all of them, all dogs go to heaven.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.280
Well, your PlayStation is not going.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.720
Oh, the Blair Witch.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:18.600
Wow.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:19.720
Let's see.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:24.200
It was because I see the picture on this site is this is Spinal Tap.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:31.480
So but, you know, all of the Hunger Games are in there and so on and so on.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.520
There's a lot of movies that are affected by this.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:40.200
Yeah, this is kind of crappy because this is why people don't want to buy their stuff digitally.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.400
I'm not sure.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.280
I mean, again, this is in Germany, Austria, so it doesn't affect the US.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.160
But I'm sitting here going, how is this legal?

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.360
Like, aren't they just asking to get sued over this?

01:12:52.560 --> 01:13:02.480
The consumer doesn't give a fuck about the licensing, but they're going to say, like, I paid for something and you took it away and you didn't give a refund because we haven't heard anything about refunds yet.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.640
So it's yeah.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:12.280
So anyway, we're only talking about a certain type of content in two countries, but it's still a precedent.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.640
I mean, it's two countries.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.360
It's no small, you know, thing.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:22.760
But it's still like, hey, why is the publisher allowed to even remove access in the first place?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.400
And I think this is going to get ugly.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.240
And I know you shouldn't read that.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.080
I wonder what's in the user agreement.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.280
You know, it's funny, I shouldn't read the comments, but I'm going to.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.960
And there's actually a meme here.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:37.400
Hold on. I'm going to show this on stream because it's just too funny.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.960
But on this site that I'm looking at here, it has this meme.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.080
You can always pirate digital media.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.200
It's always morally correct.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:57.880
And that you know what, as as much as that's a meme and stuff, I think that is exactly where a lot of people are going to go.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.280
With this, for sure.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.640
Yeah, no.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:08.240
DJ Rama S in chat says, remember, you only own a license to view the material, not own it.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:14.000
I still think when you tick off the user base and there's lawsuits, but again, I can't profess to sit here and

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.840
go, I know what the recourse is in Germany and Austria.

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:26.760
But I also now go, you know what, when people are like, hell, no, I don't want a digital PlayStation 5 or no, I don't want my games digitally.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.400
I still want games on disk.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.080
Can you blame them when you see a story like this?

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.560
Can you blame people that want to go that route?

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.280
Because I sure don't.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.320
So anyway.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:42.720
Let's take a trip back to a time when there wasn't digital only versions of stuff.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.600
Digital was only possible through a 9600 baud modem in our next segment.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:05.440
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.560
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:13.760
And what did you pick for the game this week, Dark Sakura?

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.200
Ikaruga.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.640
Wow, this has never been done before.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:23.400
I'm always shocked at the games that somehow have not made it to the classic game of the week yet.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.320
And this is one of them.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:36.960
So Ikaruga is a shoot-em-up that was developed by Treasure, and it is the spiritual successor to a radiant silver gun that came out in 1998.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:54.480
This was originally released in Japanese arcades in December of 2001, where you play a pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using a specially designed fighter called the Ikaruga that can flip between polarities from black to white.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.320
The polarity is really the foundation of the game.

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.560
So all of the enemies and bullets are either black or white.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:08.240
The bullets of the same color as the player are absorbed while the others will hurt you.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.320
So you can actually switch between the both.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.440
And the game has both single and co-op mode.

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:27.920
A little bit about its development is that the director had been working on some things.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:38.240
By the way, that's Iuchi Hiroshi, but he'd been working on the game during off hours when Treasure was making Sin and Punishment in 2000.

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:48.160
It began as a direct sequel to Radiant Silver Gun and had the polarity mechanism from Silhouette Mirage from 1997.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.400
The prototype had limited ammo.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:58.480
The bullet absorption was meant to refill ammo, but they found it weak since it caused breaks in the action.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:04.360
And also Treasure has a very specific game design philosophy.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:16.560
And Ikaruga was intentionally built to challenge the conventions of standard game design and develop a new type of shooting game.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:27.240
So altogether, five of the staff at Treasure worked on Ikaruga and then three of the support staff from G-Rev.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:35.840
So when it was released in Japanese arcades, it really had a mixed reaction.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.840
It was new, it was different.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.920
People were like, we don't like different stuff.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:47.040
But, you know, it was a little bit more like a puzzle where you could dodge those bullets or absorb the bullets.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:53.160
It did get a port to the Dreamcast in 2002, which I have.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:04.840
And then it started developing a following from import gamers, especially the people who probably couldn't afford Radiant Silver Gun,

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:09.000
like somebody talking on this microphone sitting in this chair right now.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:18.360
It did get a later release in the West in 2003 on GameCube and had very positive reviews.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:23.600
It was praised for graphics and the art and the sound design.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:34.040
People's biggest problem with it was its difficulty, but they all thought that the game design was really innovative

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:44.200
and that it just basically, you know, kicked other shooter games kind of on its side.

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:51.760
So, of course, it was ported to the Xbox 360, to Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:19:01.120
And now in retrospect, this game was considered to be one of the best shoot-em-ups and one of Treasure's best games.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.760
So a little bit more about the gameplay.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.240
It is vertically scrolling.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.200
You can either play single or two-player co-op.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:22.240
And so when you see a burst of bullets of a certain color, you can switch to that color of bullet to absorb,

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:27.080
but you have to shoot with the opposite color one.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.680
Now, Fifth Stream is talking about turning your TV on the side.

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.640
You can get monitors that swivel.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:41.600
And I have to check my Dreamcast version, but I think that it did support vertical mode.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:48.320
But the home ports also had additional gameplay modes.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:56.480
You could have practice from single stages that you've already unlocked at normal or slow speed.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:01.840
There's a challenge mode that logs your score in comparison to others worldwide.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:14.600
And then if conditions are met, there's a prototype mode which limits your bullets and you have to replace your bullets by absorbing other bullets to refill your ammo.

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:26.440
And then there's an alternative way called Bullet Eater, where you do not fire any shots and navigate through the game by absorbing bullets.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:36.600
So with the development of it, it was self-funded and self-published.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:50.800
It was worked on at home and the prototype was made between Iichi Hiroshi and Nakagawa Atsutomo.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:21:09.760
And they borrowed elements from their own other games, and as far as the defense system, that was inspired by Shinrei Jusatsuchi Tadomaru that came out on Sega Saturn.

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:21.960
Some sprites were reused from Radiant Silver Gun to do the prototype quickly, and then they brought it up for testing and finally implemented the final system.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.280
So it is considered a spiritual sequel.

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:31.120
Radiant Silver Gun was supposed to be a trilogy, and so Ikaruga was supposed to be the direct sequel.

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:42.600
And it was codenamed Project RS2, as in Radiant Silver Gun 2, where the concept for Radiant Silver Gun was a world for Ikaruga, it was will.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:47.200
And so they really wanted to just push the limits and change things.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:50.720
But after a while, it sort of became its own creature.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:22:01.720
It was targeted to Treasure's core fan base, so they were really looking for what Treasure fans wanted, not necessarily a broader market.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:11.720
And the NAOMI version was actually bug checked on a Dreamcast, so doing the port was really easy.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:21.720
So it was released in arcades on December 20th, 2001, and the Dreamcast port was exclusively sold in Japan starting September 5th, 2002.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:26.720
And lots of people imported it. I imported it. That game was great.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:32.720
It was published for GameCube in Japan under the Atari label.

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:37.720
Sorry, Infogrames did that release on January 16th, 2003.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.720
And then later on it came out in the US and Europe on GameCube.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:51.720
And it was because of that import fan base that it saw really big success on the GameCube.

01:22:51.720 --> 01:23:04.720
So Microsoft released it for Xbox Live for Xbox 360 on April 9th, 2008, with new leaderboards, achievements, and recording and replaying your playthroughs.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:14.720
Treasure released Ikaruga on the Nesic Axe Live, which is an arcade distribution platform, on August 8th, 2013.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:20.720
And then Treasure put it on Steam Greenlight for Windows.

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:28.720
And then it came out on Steam on February 18th, 2014, published by Nichols for Nintendo Switch on May 29th, 2018.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.720
It also supported horizontal and vertical screen orientation.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.720
June 2018, it came on PlayStation 4, November 22nd, 2019.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:42.720
There were physical copies in production for the Switch and the PlayStation 4.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:48.720
It was, I mean, this game got some pretty hardcore great reviews.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:52.720
It was considered innovative, clever, and unique.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:57.720
The difficulty was a plus for some, a minus for others.

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:11.720
So the Dreamcast version for GameSpot and Dorimaga were about an 8.5 out of 10.

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:17.720
The GameCube versions, Famitsu gave it a 36 out of 40, which is pretty damn good.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.720
Nintendo Life gave it a 9 out of 10.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:23.720
Metacritic gave it an 85 out of 100.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:27.720
So it was an amazing seller.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:33.720
The Dreamcast and GameCube versions sold 33,860 physical units in Japan.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:40.720
Xbox Live Arcade sold 137,088 digital units as of 2011.

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:50.720
And the PC version on Steam sold 128,543 digital units as of July 1st, 2018.

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:51.720
And there you go.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:56.720
I agree with Questbuster in chat who says it's such a beautiful game too.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.720
Treasures creativity really shines through.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.720
It is, but I gotta be honest, like this game is very hard for me to play.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.720
Like I have a hard time wrapping my head around the polarity mechanic.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:11.720
Like it's just, it's a lot to manage, you know, but yeah, like watching this video

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.720
that we're seeing live on Twitch of somebody doing now,

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:16.720
I think this is some type of record run, but still I'm just like,

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.720
oh my gosh, there's just so much going on in the game.

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.720
Seeing this game beaten in person.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:26.720
With an almost perfect playthrough.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.720
Or when they do the bullet eater modes, that's always fun.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:30.720
Yeah.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.720
The bullet eater mode is ridiculous.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.720
But I mean, this game is just so beautiful.

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:41.720
I mean, there's times where, you know, I'll come in and Dan was napping on the couch

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.720
with a playthrough of Ikaruga in the background to listen to the soundtrack.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.720
But it's so beautiful.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.720
And for a game that came out in 2001.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:56.720
So we're talking about a game that's 21 years old as of December.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.720
This game still stands up graphically and by artistry and by music.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:05.720
It's really, really timeless.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.720
I say it's timeless.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.720
It's a true classic.

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.720
And again, why I kind of joked at the beginning there,

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.720
sometimes we have games in this segment where it's like, really?

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.720
We haven't done that before?

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.720
But no, we just we just talk about it a lot,

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.720
but never officially as a classic game of the week.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.720
But now that has been remedied.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.720
It is.

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:27.720
It's just a perfect game.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:28.720
Yeah.

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:29.720
All right.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:30.720
That's what I call a perfect game.

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.720
Ikaruga, the classic game of the week.

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:34.720
Need we say more?

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:35.720
All right.

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:38.720
We're going to travel around and check out some news quickly

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.720
in a segment called Rapid Fire News.

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.720
And Loki, we'll start with you.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:45.720
I keep telling myself I don't need things like this

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.720
because I have no place to put them.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.720
But good luck.

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:55.720
Nintendo and Lego have partnered again to create a new Lego thing.

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:59.720
And this time it is King Koopa.

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:06.720
So you can get a very large scale Koopa creation.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.720
They call it the Mighty Bowser.

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:09.720
That's what it is.

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.720
It's going to be in stores October 1st

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.720
for two hundred and sixty nine ninety nine.

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:16.720
Too expensive.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.720
I'm not paying three hundred dollars.

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.720
I'm not paying three hundred dollars for that.

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:21.720
Sorry.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:22.720
I love Legos.

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.720
I love doing all that stuff, but no.

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.720
You know what?

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.720
I came damn close to buying before I bought the Spice Girls thing,

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:32.720
which was only like maybe 40 bucks, which Spice Girls are priceless.

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.720
I'll pay whatever for that.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:36.720
But the which also.

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.720
OK, a second tangent.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.720
Do you know how like there's that whole generation that a lot of us fit into,

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.720
which is like somewhere between the geriatric millennial

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.720
and the young Gen X that is often called like the Oregon Trail generation

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.720
or Zillennial, I think is the other one.

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.720
I heard that called the other day the Spice Girls generation.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.720
And I was like, that's what I want.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:27:59.720
That's me.

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:00.720
Yes.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.720
Use that one referring to my people.

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.720
But anyway, not me.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.720
Well, humbug.

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:12.720
Anyway, like I was in the radio head,

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.720
but in all seriousness, I did not realize you could still get the Lego

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.720
NES with the the rolling TV and that stuff.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:22.720
I thought that was like a limited edition thing, but they still had it at the store.

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:24.720
So I really wanted to get that.

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:25.720
I still might.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.720
I don't know.

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:27.720
We'll see.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:28.720
But they passed.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.720
So there's there's buttons on this thing where you can puppet him

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.720
to make him move around and shoot fireballs.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.720
I may have to get this.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:37.720
Just say it's for the kids.

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:39.720
Say it's for the kids.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.720
Who's going to actually believe that, Rob?

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.720
No one's going to believe that.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:44.720
All right.

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.720
What else you got?

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.720
And then, of course, this is kind of funny.

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:55.720
So there was an Xbox live stream that was shown on Twitch.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.720
And apparently during the clip.

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:03.720
It's it was it was saying that, oh,

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.720
my acting coach actually is the voice of She-Hulk,

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:09.720
and I won't say her name because I don't know if that's public knowledge yet.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.720
I think it is if it was announced.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:17.720
And then unfortunately, the lead designer is like, nope, we never announced She-Hulk.

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:20.720
We don't announce things on these live streams.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:27.720
So unfortunately, it's been rumored that She-Hulk is coming to the Marvel's Avengers game.

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.720
Looks like that's going to be.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:30.720
She's awesome.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:37.720
Probably if I were to guess, because they've been releasing characters in certain cadence.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:42.720
There is a Marvel She-Hulk show that's starting in August, right?

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.720
I mean, it's probably going to be when that comes out.

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.720
That's a pretty good guess.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.720
It's a pretty safe wager there.

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.720
But you know what?

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.720
Hosting live is hard.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:56.720
And sometimes I can speak with some authority on that.

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:57.720
And you know what?

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:01.720
Sometimes, now granted, I don't host stuff where I have NDAs in the back of my head,

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.720
but I can see where somebody makes some mistakes.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:08.720
I actually feel sorry for the host, you know, even though it makes a moment that goes viral.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.720
That's not the thing you want to go viral for.

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:12.720
It's just a bummer.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:16.720
So I hope she doesn't get reprimanded or anything.

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.720
It's just unfortunate.

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.720
So, all right.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.720
Dark Soccer, you have something.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.720
I do.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:31.720
So, for fans of The Matrix, The Matrix Awakens will be delisted this week.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:38.720
Because the Unreal Engine 5 experience will be leaving the digital consoles on July 9th.

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:43.720
If you have it, then you can still use it.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:46.720
You can kind of like how the PT was.

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:52.720
But if you don't get it by yesterday, there's no getting it again.

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.720
Which I forgot to do. I'm really mad at myself.

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.720
It's fine.

01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:58.720
I know.

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:02.720
But maybe someone will put out a clone or something.

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:03.720
Maybe, maybe.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.720
Yeah, but at any rate, you know, there's always the internet.

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:07.720
You can always watch it online.

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:08.720
True.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:11.720
All right, well, I also have one quick story for you.

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.720
And it's something that Jason mentioned in the intro to the show tonight.

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.720
And he said this made him smile.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.720
And yeah, this made me smile really big, too.

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:24.720
And it makes me want to pay attention to this console that admittedly I'm not paying enough attention to.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:25.720
It's a great console.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.720
You've got my attention, that's for sure.

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:29.720
And that is Evercade.

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:32.720
And their C64 collection that's coming out.

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:36.720
Fourteen classic games from the Commodore 64.

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:42.720
Including summer games, winter games, Impossible Mission, Jumpman, so like all the epic necessities.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.720
I love Jumpman.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.720
I love Jumpman.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:49.720
Gateway to ASFI, the Movie Monster game, which I don't see that one in collections a lot.

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.720
Storm Lord, Battle Valley, Alley Cat.

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.720
I know I played that one when I was younger.

01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.720
Street Sports Baseball, because you have to have a sports game in there.

01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:59.720
And so on and so on.

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:02.720
I got to say, this collection looks awesome.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:08.720
Now, of course, the mini Commodore 64 has 30 games on it, and this only has 14.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:11.720
But it's a pretty solid list of 14 games.

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:17.720
And they do label it the C64 Collection 1, which indicates there will be more in the future.

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:18.720
But I think this is pretty cool.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:22.720
And I got to say, I'm kind of interested in picking up an Evercade.

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:26.720
And I don't know a lot about it, but it's because it's mostly...

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:28.720
They're made in Europe, right?

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.720
So they're not exactly on the shelves here, right?

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:31.720
Yeah, they're...

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:35.720
I don't know if I've ever seen them on the shelves, but they have like a ton of stuff in there.

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.720
Yeah, they have a ton of Atari stuff, and they have a lot of cartridges.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:46.720
I wish I could get involved with some of this, but there's a lot of Nest Maker game collections that are on there.

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:57.720
There's a lot of stuff, and plus they have a handheld console, and then they have the actual physical console that's in a TV.

01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:03.720
What's kind of cool about the TV consoles is you can actually have two of your cartridges loaded in there at the same time.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:06.720
So you can play a bunch of games on there.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:13.720
But yeah, it's a pretty solid console, I think, with all the different things coming out.

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:21.720
Speaking of which, I know there's a new Commodore 64 mini console coming out, but it's more of a computer that they're charging like $500 for.

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:24.720
Yeah, it's kind of like what the Atari VCS thing, yeah.

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:29.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a nice shell, but this is pretty cool to see this kind of stuff.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.720
Did they say California games? Oh, summer games?

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:35.720
No, summer games and winter games.

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:38.720
So it's missing summer games too, and it's missing California games.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.720
Well, that's probably where number two is going to be.

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:45.720
Exactly. So just so we're clear, some of the stuff that's on the Evercade.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:50.720
Evercade has right now 27 cartridges for consoles.

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:56.720
And what's kind of cool about it, I mean, you start with like the Atari collection, the Namco collection, right?

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:02.720
But then you start to really get the Atari Lynx collection is available, one and two.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:10.720
The Codemasters collection, there's an Intellivision collection, the Gremlin collection, which I think is kind of cool.

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.720
And then they have some arcade stuff too.

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:15.720
So there's, yeah, it's pretty cool.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.720
And now they're getting into this computer cartridge collection.

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.720
So with the C64 collection, I'm sure there'll be more.

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.720
There'll have to be more.

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:26.720
Yeah, I don't know where locally I can get an Evercade, but those are pretty cool looking.

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.720
Yeah, that's pretty neat.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.720
It definitely has my attention. I might have to pick some of that up.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:34.720
I love the fact that there's like a TV console and a handheld one and the cartridges kind of work on both.

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:35.720
It's pretty cool.

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:41.720
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some new games you can check out this week.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.720
Well, maybe some repackaging and remasters too.

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.720
But let's check out the world release date, starting with the US with Loki.

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:55.720
Yes, so I can't imagine there's a whole lot coming out in July, which is typically the case.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:00.720
We've got Fist, Forged in Shadow Torch.

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.720
That is coming out on Nintendo Switch.

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:08.720
Garden Story on Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.720
Hella Point.

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.720
Oh, I'm sorry, that's Hell Point.

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:15.720
That's on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:19.720
Kroot, the Mythic Wings.

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:25.720
That's on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:29.720
Monument Valley Panoramic Edition on PC.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:34.720
And same with that, Monument Valley 2, the Panoramic Edition, also on PC.

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:41.720
And then Time on Frog Island on PC, Nintendo Switch.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:45.720
PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:49.720
I don't believe this is a sequel to Frog Fractions, unfortunately.

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:52.720
Loopmancer on PC.

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:56.720
Rune Factory 5, also on PC.

01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.720
Tales of Biston on PC and Xbox One.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:04.720
Okay, I guess there's everything coming out this week.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.720
You know, normally July is pretty light.

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:13.720
Azure Strikers Gunvolt 2 on Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:17.720
What is this title?

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:20.720
Let's see, Chickip Dancers.

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:26.720
Nori Nori Dance de Kokoro Mo Otoro.

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:29.720
And that's on Nintendo Switch.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:35.720
Escape Academy on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:41.720
Eyes in the Dark, The Curious Case of One Victoria Bloom on PC.

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:50.720
G-Mode Archives Plus, Megami Tensei Gaiden, Shinyaku Last Bible on Nintendo Switch.

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:56.720
Mothman 1966 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.720
The most exciting release of the week, Powerwash Simulator.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:03.720
I'm guessing we're finally hitting 1.0 or something like that.

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:06.720
That's on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.720
Game Pass for that one.

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:09.720
Yep, Game Pass.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:12.720
Worth Life on Nintendo Switch.

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:17.720
Dread Out 2 on Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:22.720
And last but not least, The Future You've Been Dreaming Of on PC.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.720
It's a simulation game.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:24.720
Fun.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.720
All right, we're going to Japan.

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.720
It's not quite as crowded as Loki's US list,

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:32.720
but we do have some of the crossovers on the Nintendo Switch in Japan this week.

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:38.720
We had that same Chik-Kip Dancers, which that sounded like a Japanese release anyway.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:42.720
But yeah, that same release is on the Switch in Japan on the 14th,

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:47.720
as is Bokuura no Kishigomu Otoshi Shingake.

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:52.720
Plus, All Seasons in Joy set is also on the Switch this week.

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.720
I think it's a collection of games.

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:59.720
It looks like curling and hockey and a bunch of mini sports games,

01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:01.720
maybe played in a school yard type of thing.

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:05.720
Wreckfest is also out on the Switch this week in Japan.

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:10.720
Going to the PlayStation 5, Outward is the big release this week on the PlayStation 5,

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.720
and that is the Definitive Edition that is releasing in Japan this week.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.720
Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:21.720
All on the 15th for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch,

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:25.720
DC League of Super Pets, Adventure of Crypto and Ace,

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:30.720
and then Ultra Age on PlayStation and Switch, and that is it.

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.720
All right. We have a few more stories for you,

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.720
and then we will get to the listener roundtable,

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.720
where we'll be taking your calls in our green room,

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.720
as well as your emails.

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:42.720
Participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to email us.

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:45.720
Let's get to this next story, which...

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:50.720
Just get to it, Loki, while I sigh.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.720
Yeah, so before we get to that,

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:56.720
I wanted to mention the United States Best Buy carries the advocate.

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:57.720
Oh, really?

01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:59.720
So that might be worth checking out.

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:00.720
That's some good news.

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:01.720
Yes, that's some good news.

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.720
Not good news, unfortunately,

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:09.720
is apparently there's been some misunderstandings.

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:14.720
Apparently, the Prime Minister of Japan,

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:19.720
Shinzo Abe, has been assassinated,

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:25.720
and in Greece, apparently, some news station identified,

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:30.720
or showed a picture of Hideo Kojima as the assassin.

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:33.720
Now, I don't think that's correct.

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.720
It is not correct. Let's be clear.

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:38.720
Obviously.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.720
And so they've been kind of, you know,

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:43.720
spreading this misinformation for a while.

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:46.720
So now that that's, you know, come out,

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:48.720
obviously, Hideo Kojima is like,

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.720
no, I'm not the assassin,

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:53.720
and then also, I'm going to sue you

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.720
if you keep, you know, posting my photo

01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.720
and saying I'm the assassin.

01:39:58.720 --> 01:39:59.720
Good for him.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.720
So, you know, he's not going to tolerate such libel.

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:03.720
Good.

01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:06.720
And unfortunately, and I'm going to fully admit,

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.720
I don't know how true this is,

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.720
but I have seen this happen in the past

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:14.720
where 4chan and those sites,

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:17.720
that whole part of the internet,

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:22.720
pushes this fake agenda on these sites

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:24.720
that don't know how to do their research.

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:27.720
Stop getting your news from 4chan, period.

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.720
For sure.

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:30.720
But that's why it's not funny.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:34.720
Like this is, it's racist, quite frankly,

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.720
you know, that, you know,

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:40.720
that Kojima gets the pin because, you know,

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:42.720
they don't know how to do their research

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:43.720
and this whole stuff.

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.720
It's just, it's disgusting.

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.720
And it's not funny,

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:50.720
but it's a part of gaming culture, unfortunately,

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.720
because who else would think it's funny

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:58.720
to misidentify Hideo Kojima as the shooter?

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.720
That was a gamer that did that.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:04.720
So, but I say gamer in parentheses

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.720
because not in my circle.

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:07.720
You're not allowed to be a gamer.

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:12.720
I don't want to be a gamer if you're a gamer, quite frankly.

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:15.720
Mike Defton Chat says Kojima should sue.

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:16.720
Honestly, he should,

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.720
because this happens to people

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:20.720
who don't have the resources to sue sometimes.

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.720
And I wish Kojima would sue

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:24.720
and make an example out of it, quite frankly.

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.720
Yeah.

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.720
Dark to see it pointed out Kojima Productions

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.720
had to go so far as to put out a tweet about it.

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.720
I guess it's gross.

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.720
So, and obviously that whole situation-

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:34.720
It just can't with people.

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.720
Yeah, it's just, yeah.

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:42.720
Anyway, Questbuster says the politician

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.720
behind the information retracted it and apologized,

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.720
but the damage was done.

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.720
Yeah, I mean, once on the internet,

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.720
always on the internet,

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.720
and it's like, do your fucking research.

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:53.720
Don't just blast it first.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.720
I mean, what are you, TMZ?

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:58.720
I mean, maybe this was the Greek version of TMZ.

01:41:58.720 --> 01:41:59.720
I don't know,

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:02.720
but I guess if they can jump to conclusions, so can I.

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:05.720
So, I'll just say it was the Greek version of TMZ.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.720
All right.

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.720
TMZ is such garbage too.

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.720
Yeah, but it's the exact same thing.

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:11.720
They'll just publish something

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:15.720
and not caring about the resource

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:16.720
or not caring about the recourse

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.720
and just to get the clicks

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.720
if they just believe it to be true.

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:22.720
They don't care who they hurt in the interim

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:23.720
as long as they get their money.

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:25.720
And they'll pay people to violate HIPAA

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.720
to give them the inside scoop on what's going on

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.720
at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Hollywood.

01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:31.720
So, it's crazy.

01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:36.720
All right, let's move on back to actual gaming news

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:39.720
for actual gamers, Dark Sakura.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720
Oh.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.720
Xbox 360 games will no longer be a part

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:51.720
of the Games with Gold starting in October.

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:56.720
They will stop providing monthly free Xbox 360 games.

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:59.720
They've already sent out emails to Xbox Live subscribers,

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:04.720
and Microsoft said that it will continue

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:08.720
to give out free Xbox One games going forward.

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:12.720
So, yeah, bye.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.720
Yeah, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like,

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.720
ah, bummer, but at the same time, it's like,

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:21.720
okay, this is the equivalent of PlayStation 3 games

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.720
still coming out for free every month.

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.720
And it's kind of like, I think the ship has now sailed

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:29.720
everything that is willing to be given away as part of that.

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:30.720
I shouldn't say given away because they do-

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.720
Well, they said they hit their limit.

01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.720
Yeah, exactly, they hit their limit.

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.720
That's what it is, that the well is dry

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.720
and there is nothing else that they,

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:40.720
and I'm sure people still have plenty of games

01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:43.720
they'd like to see, but the reality is they have

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:47.720
to pay money to get that on the service to give it away.

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:50.720
And there's no more agreements to be had

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:52.720
in the Xbox 360 space.

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:55.720
I'm kind of surprised they're still moving forward

01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.720
with Xbox One for a little while,

01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.720
but I guess that's the equivalent of PS4

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:04.720
and we still see new games coming out at that level.

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.720
So that'll probably still be for a while.

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.720
Yeah, that one is understandable.

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:10.720
Yeah.

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:12.720
Dr. Seuss says, I don't know if I'm misremembering,

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:14.720
but didn't they say you could just keep the 360 games

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:17.720
you did claim even if gold lapses?

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:20.720
Yes, because it was a limitation of the Xbox 360 system,

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.720
didn't check for that stuff.

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.720
They built it into the Xbox One and later.

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:27.720
So when you claim Xbox 360 games, essentially,

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.720
you don't claim them the same way either.

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:30.720
They kind of come through a different storefront,

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.720
but long story short, you're claiming those to your account

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:36.720
forever because the 360 games don't ping the server

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:37.720
to make sure they're still valid.

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:40.720
It wasn't something Microsoft had built in at the time,

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.720
but it's there now.

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.720
So, all right.

01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:48.720
Bonstable06 says, my Game Pass expired last week

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.720
and I'm not in a rush to renew it.

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.720
Well, keep in mind, Games with Gold and Game Pass,

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:53.720
they are different.

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.720
For some reason, they're still different, but they are.

01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:57.720
For now.

01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.720
Unless you had Games Pass Ultimate

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.720
because Games Pass Ultimate includes

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:03.720
the Games with Gold and all that.

01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.720
So do keep that in mind is that there is a difference

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:08.720
between this and Game Pass, which I know,

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:10.720
believe me, I think it's weird too.

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:13.720
They should just unify it already, but whatever.

01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:14.720
All right, moving on.

01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:18.720
I think about whatever is a common parlance these days.

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:19.720
Yeah.

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:22.720
All right, moving on, Lucky.

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:24.720
It's another bundle.

01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:26.720
It's another itch.io bundle.

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:29.720
So of course, because we live in a world

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:31.720
where horrible things keep happening,

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.720
we're at least going to try to support people

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.720
the best way we can because we can't stop

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:37.720
the horrible things from happening.

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:41.720
In this case, in light of the Supreme Court's decision

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.720
to overturn Roe v. Wade,

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:47.720
there has been some fundraising done by

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:50.720
Caro Asserton,

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:53.720
who has put together a itch.io bundle

01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.720
with lots of games.

01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:58.720
I'm not sure on the exact number, but for $10.

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:01.720
700 creators.

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:05.720
So yeah, it's the indie bundle for abortion funds.

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.720
Yeah, 750 games, 600 creators,

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:12.720
$3,000 value for $10.

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:13.720
At least $10.

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.720
You're always welcome to get more money for the cause, yeah.

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:21.720
And I'm glad to hear that it's going to the abortion funds

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:25.720
because that's really where the money is needed right now.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:29.720
I'll admit Planned Parenthood gets a lot of donations already,

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.720
but your local abortion funds need it more.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:35.720
Yeah, so it's lots of games.

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.720
I have so many games on itch.io now,

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:40.720
I don't even know where to begin.

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:43.720
Time to start a new YouTube series.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.720
There's so many.

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.720
Call it The Backlog.

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.720
Oh God, that could last forever.

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:54.720
Honestly, just The Backlog and Steam is enough to have a backlog.

01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:56.720
Oh, trust me. Trust me.

01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:00.720
I know. I'm sure anybody listening to the show feels there.

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.720
But at the end of the day, keep the focus not on building your backlog,

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:05.720
but the good cause and everything.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:08.720
And it's always nice to see the gaming community and gaming creators

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:13.720
and indie creators really coming together for a necessary cause.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:16.720
What shouldn't have to be, but is necessary in this day and age.

01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.720
Yeah, I really need to pay attention to the forums on itch.io

01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:22.720
to get my game more of these bundles.

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:23.720
I keep forgetting to do that.

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:25.720
And it's like, oh man, I would have done that.

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.720
But fine.

01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:28.720
All right.

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:34.720
This last story tonight is very much a what type of story.

01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:37.720
But I want to talk about it as somebody who is a fan of this game

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.720
and plays an awful lot of it.

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.720
Even if I don't say it in my gaming week every week,

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.720
chances are I probably played some Final Fantasy 14.

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.720
And you are probably seeing a bunch of stuff going on online

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.720
about a billboard that was recently spotted.

01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.720
Yeah, this is the deal.

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.720
This was actually like an in-game group that decided to buy real life,

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:04.720
not in-game billboards, real life billboards

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:09.720
for an event that was going to be happening in Rain Nightclub.

01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.720
Here's the thing.

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:13.720
The player housing in Final Fantasy 14,

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.720
people have gotten very creative with it.

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:18.720
And yeah, people run full on nightclubs in these things.

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.720
And they'll put up a Twitch stream

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.720
and they'll have like actual DJs DJing live

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:28.720
while characters are dancing in the housing.

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:31.720
And it's a thing.

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:33.720
And it's a thing that's gotten to this level

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:36.720
where we're advertising it in the real world.

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.720
So it was a, and hold on,

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:40.720
I got to see if I can get a picture of this billboard.

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:42.720
At least for those that are watching live on Twitch,

01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:43.720
you can actually see what this looked like.

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:46.720
If you have, I'm sure many of you have come across this already,

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:48.720
but it's the Summer Bash.

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:52.720
And you can see it says the name of the nightclub in there.

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:54.720
It tells you what the Discord is.

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:56.720
It even says, and this would make sense

01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:58.720
to nobody who doesn't play the game,

01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:02.720
but it actually says we're on the Crystal Balmung server,

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:05.720
Ward 23, Plot 5 in Myst.

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:10.720
And the other interesting thing is it uses trademark stuff

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.720
like the official Final Fantasy 14 logo.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:16.720
And as I understand it, this is like a Viera hairstyle

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:18.720
that isn't even in the game right now.

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:21.720
So it's like hacked out or something

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.720
to show up on this billboard.

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:28.720
But my, I mean, it's like the fandom has hit that level.

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:31.720
Two of them apparently went up in Texas

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.720
where there, I had heard rumors

01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:36.720
they were supposed to be going up in California as well,

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:38.720
but I think things started,

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:42.720
as this got more and more coverage,

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:45.720
I think it kind of got pulled back a little bit there.

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:46.720
So-

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:47.720
Fandom's gonna fandom.

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:48.720
Yeah.

01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:50.720
Also, by the way, Reign Nightclub apparently

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:52.720
also has advertised in the past,

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:56.720
erotic role play, ERP, if that's your thing.

01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:58.720
And I'm not here to yuck somebody's yum,

01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:03.720
but I mean, you don't have to put it on a billboard either,

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.720
but go off, I guess.

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:09.720
Show everybody that disposable income you've got right now.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.720
So, wow.

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:15.720
Anyway, no word yet as to how Square Enix

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.720
may or may not be involved in this.

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:19.720
I don't know.

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:21.720
Anyway, apparently-

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:25.720
Oh, God.

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.720
Because you want to see how the internet does things here?

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:30.720
Let me see.

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:31.720
There's this tweet.

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.720
Reporting live-

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.720
Hold on.

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:37.720
Reporting live at the Free Company house

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:40.720
responsible for the Final Fantasy XIV billboard,

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.720
we have tanks shooting directly at the house

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.720
and Shiba's barking loudly,

01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:50.720
and there's everybody with their tanks.

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:53.720
Why is there tanks in the game?

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.720
It's a mount of some sort that you can get at some point.

01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:58.720
But the best part is,

01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:01.720
was it the Habbo Hotel stuff?

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:04.720
That's a throwback to an inappropriate meme.

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.720
They have all been on Fat Chocobos.

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:09.720
That is, yeah, that's quite a throwback.

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:11.720
Fat Chocobos is the best mount.

01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:19.720
I mean, we've been doing this for over 20 years,

01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:23.720
and very few times on this show am I rendered speechless

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:24.720
where I'm like,

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:26.720
This is the internet.

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:27.720
What else?

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:28.720
What else is there to say?

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:30.720
I just think it's important to say,

01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:34.720
please know if you've never played Final Fantasy XIV,

01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.720
there is much more to the game than this.

01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:41.720
This is just people doing what people do on the internet.

01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:45.720
This is not the whole and the entirety of Final Fantasy XIV.

01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:49.720
This is just people doing what people do on the internet.

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:53.720
This is not the whole and the entirety of Final Fantasy XIV.

01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:57.720
Please, please don't believe all that.

01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:58.720
Anyway.

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:03.720
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:06.720
The Discord post from them was amazing,

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.720
wanting to sue people for doing emote reactions.

01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:15.720
You bought a billboard in real life.

01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:19.720
You took the game to a real life space.

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:26.720
What in the actual fuck did you think was going to happen?

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:28.720
But people would notice.

01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.720
Some people.

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:37.720
Oh, we're going to advertise for this thing,

01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:38.720
but not to you.

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.720
Don't do this.

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:41.720
In Texas.

01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:42.720
In Texas.

01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:47.720
Everything's bigger in Texas.

01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:48.720
All right.

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:50.720
We're going to open up this.

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:52.720
Including the pains in the ass?

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:55.720
The Discord server to your calls in the green room

01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:58.720
over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:00.720
And hey, I would encourage you to join the Discord

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:02.720
just to talk with us throughout the week

01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:05.720
about all sorts of stories and things that get posted in there.

01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:07.720
We have a call on the line.

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:09.720
I'm pretty sure I know exactly what this guy wants to talk about.

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:11.720
And it's always a pleasure to welcome into the show.

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:14.720
So let's get to our first call tonight.

01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:16.720
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:17.720
Who's this?

01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:19.720
Oh, he was on Orange Launch Radio.

01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:20.720
Let's try it again.

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:22.720
He dropped into the other channel.

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.720
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:24.720
Let's try again.

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:25.720
Who's this?

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:27.720
I hope that this works

01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:30.720
because it is the one and only Ranma

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.720
and I've been having some PC issues lately.

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:36.720
But I would like to say to my brothers and sisters

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.720
from another mother.

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:40.720
Oh, we got to talk about this RePop shit real quick.

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:42.720
You sure do.

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:44.720
I don't know why I lost Loki's picture,

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:45.720
but while I try to get that back,

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:48.720
why don't you tell us what's on your mind?

01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:52.720
It's all about the almighty dollar.

01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:54.720
And I'll say this.

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:56.720
When RePop rolled in with New York Comic Con,

01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:57.720
it was great.

01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:58.720
It was fun.

01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:01.720
I used to do coverage for that convention

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:03.720
because they wanted press outlets.

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:04.720
They wanted podcasters.

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:08.720
They want everybody to talk about this convention left and right.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:09.720
And I did it for a few years.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:12.720
I am already feeling the familiarity of this story.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:14.720
And you heard what I had to say earlier.

01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:18.720
And I'm already feeling, oh, I know exactly where this is going

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:20.720
because I've lived it.

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:21.720
But please continue.

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:25.720
And then I apply for one time and they go,

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.720
your application is rejected.

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.720
And I'm just like, the hell?

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:35.720
Evidently, Anime Jam Session just wasn't popular enough for them.

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:40.720
We don't get like one million hits a week on our site

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:41.720
and stuff like that.

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:44.720
So we were rejected.

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:46.720
And I said, you know what?

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:48.720
I'll buy a badge this year.

01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.720
I will never do that again.

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:54.720
From that point on, I decided large conventions,

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:58.720
despite the genre, don't need me.

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.720
I will go to the smaller conventions

01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:04.720
where I am appreciated for the hard work that my crew does

01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:07.720
and it's less drama and less BS.

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:11.720
Now, the fact that ReadPop is rolling in here like,

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:12.720
we'll save E3.

01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:14.720
Oh, we'll save E3.

01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:16.720
Yeah, I know exactly where they're going with this, okay?

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:22.720
They're going to turn E3 into what they wanted to do with PAX

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:24.720
and it's a crying shame.

01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:29.720
Because I tell you this, growing up reading EGM, GamePro,

01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:32.720
I was hyped about E3, what was going on and so forth.

01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:36.720
When y'all covered E3, I was hyped for that and so forth.

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:40.720
But I can see the way technology is,

01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:43.720
all these companies doing their own thing and so forth.

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:47.720
In a way, there really isn't a need for E3 anymore.

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:51.720
I still say there needs to be one for people in the industry

01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:53.720
because I agree with Mr. Blackwolf.

01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:57.720
The industry needs something and GDC simply is not enough.

01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:00.720
And as you all have mentioned previously,

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.720
when they opened this up to the public,

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:05.720
which they did a few years ago,

01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:07.720
when they opened it to the public,

01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:09.720
a lot of my cosplaying friends were like,

01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:11.720
oh, we are going to E3.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.720
We're going to get cr-

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:14.720
I'm sitting there watching.

01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:15.720
No, you're not.

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:17.720
Have fun with that.

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:22.720
Because to these cosplayers and the typical con-goers,

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:27.720
they think E3 is a nonstop party from Thursday day zero

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:30.720
all the way to day three Sunday,

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:32.720
which in actuality, it is not the case.

01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:37.720
I got to interrupt because you just made me think of a great fucking point.

01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:40.720
You said Thursday, day zero.

01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:45.720
That is huge right there because E3, if I recall correctly,

01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:48.720
E3 was always a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday show.

01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:50.720
It was in the middle of the week.

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:52.720
It might've been Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:53.720
No, it was.

01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.720
Yeah.

01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:55.720
It was Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:59.720
And they did that very much intentionally because this was a trade show.

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:02.720
It was during the work week for workers.

01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:09.720
So here we are, sign number one, that this is not E3 as you knew it.

01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:14.720
This is Weekend at Bernie's with Reed Pop moving E3's corpse around.

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:17.720
Sign number one, what you just said,

01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.720
when day zero is Thursday and not, you know,

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:25.720
meaning that the con is actually Friday, Saturday, Sunday,

01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:29.720
that's your first sign that this is not the same E3.

01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:33.720
E3 experiences, dodging people and talking shop.

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:34.720
Sorry.

01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:35.720
Sorry, Rama.

01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:38.720
I don't mean to interrupt you, but you just made me inadvertently think of a,

01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:41.720
Oh, this is, that is a huge thing right there.

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:42.720
Thursday's not day zero.

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.720
Monday's day zero.

01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:45.720
No, you are right.

01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:49.720
I think I was coming down to the end and for some of us in on the con side,

01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:53.720
day zero means you'll pick up your badge and you go back to the rooms and you

01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:57.720
start pre-gaming. Okay. I don't think.

01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:00.720
That is Dragon Con Thursday. Well, no, actually now it's Wednesday.

01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:02.720
Cause Wednesday's the new Thursday. But anyway.

01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:09.720
I don't think E3 is ready for a bunch of semi buzz drunken people just rolling

01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:13.720
through playing these games and bitching and moaning and complaining.

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:17.720
No, I, no, but in the long run,

01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:20.720
they're not going to care because they got their money, you know?

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:24.720
And I'll tell you this now with this pandemic,

01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:28.720
a lot of conventions are out here throwing GoFundMes and so forth,

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:32.720
trying to make ends meet so they could survive a following year because of

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:33.720
all the fees.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.720
AX ain't doing that. They got their money.

01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:41.720
They basically have people in the industry handling that and all of their

01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:45.720
guests, their companies, they basically told them, well,

01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:48.720
since you are the sponsors,

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:51.720
you take care of the guests and you take care of all of that.

01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:54.720
You just give us the money. You have your tables.

01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:58.720
Y'all do the rest. And I can see RePop pulling the same through,

01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:02.720
same thing with E3 going to Intel,

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:06.720
going to AMD, going to Nintendo, all of them. Yes.

01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:12.720
I do understand that Intel and AMD doesn't really need to be at E3 per se,

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:16.720
but they are the backbone of the gaming and the technology.

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:18.720
So they're going to court them anyway.

01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:19.720
Intel's been there before.

01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:23.720
That's how I got a motherboard for Final Fantasy back from the Final Fantasy

01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:24.720
contest.

01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:27.720
Yeah. They do like the PC gaming showcase thing.

01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:32.720
Yeah. When Kensha Hall was a thing and E3 died with Kensha Hall.

01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:34.720
Well, they were, it wasn't even in Kensha Hall.

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:38.720
It was in the main hall that they did their PC gaming showcase thing.

01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:41.720
I thought they had a thing in Kensha Hall for a while, but yeah. Yeah.

01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:44.720
I do remember AMD being there at one point too. So anyway, but anyway,

01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:45.720
I digress.

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:49.720
And I'm telling you, if y'all go to E3 2023.

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:50.720
Well, we won't.

01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:54.720
And you walk in and you see an arrow that says,

01:59:54.720 --> 02:00:00.720
this way to Dealers Hall and Artist Alley, that's it.

02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:03.720
Game over because that's how they're going to make their money.

02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:05.720
But on the plus side, you can go to E3,

02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:10.720
come out with some nice swag that you bought, you know, just saying.

02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:14.720
You can, you can finally tell all your friends, you went to E3,

02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:18.720
a show that died in 2017, the year they opened it up to the public.

02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:23.720
Or what out? That's all I got to say is pour one out.

02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:26.720
Back in the day when they used to like,

02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:30.720
wouldn't even let all the media in because there was too many people coming.

02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:34.720
I remember when I went to E3,

02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:38.720
it was right before everything was opened up to the public and we had to

02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:41.720
submit writing samples for DDR Freak.

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:45.720
To get us in qualified as media.

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:48.720
We had to be published on the website.

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:52.720
I remember when we were, I remember when we were doing this show,

02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:57.720
but the guy that ran the network that we were on gave the E3 badge to a relative instead.

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.720
Rob, that's kind of shameless. I'm proud of you.

02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:10.720
What? Nothing.

02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:16.720
That was some hot tea right there, my friend.

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:19.720
Anyway.

02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:23.720
Uh, where were we?

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:30.720
Oh, we're sitting here enjoying some nice Earl Grey hot, discussing Reed Pop.

02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:32.720
That's what we were doing.

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.720
And Mr. Rob Roberts took himself the biggest pour of that tea.

02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:37.720
God damn, that was delicious.

02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:41.720
I have a lot to say when it comes to E3. I can't help it. I have a lot of feelings.

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:44.720
This is why we're here.

02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:53.720
Anyway, how many people got COVID at Anime Expo? Let's change the subject.

02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:56.720
We haven't heard anything yet.

02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:00.720
I have not heard anything yet, which is completely and totally shocker.

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:04.720
And I will say those photos that everybody saw at AX of the crowds,

02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:09.720
that was the first 15 minutes of day one from what I have been told.

02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:12.720
That's what the Nintendo's Hall used to look like before they opened the doors.

02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:14.720
Because that's pretty much the same thing as what that was, right?

02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:16.720
It was before they actually opened the doors.

02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:18.720
But still, I mean, justify it however you want,

02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:22.720
but you still had all those people packed in there for 15 minutes. It's not a good look.

02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:27.720
But what's interesting is if you had a VIP or Premiere badge, you went through a separate entrance.

02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:31.720
Of course. Of course.

02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:35.720
Man, listen, don't miss big events like that. I'll be honest.

02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:45.720
Rob, we're at a point where people are basically scalping anime convention badges, anime convention concert tickets, and so forth.

02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:52.720
They were doing that for E3 a lot. You'd give somebody your badge for the last day and nobody cared.

02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:56.720
Nobody was checking IDs or anything like that until they realized they probably should.

02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:04.720
I am from that generation where, you know, you bought a badge to a con.

02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:09.720
You walked up the street to Kinko's, paying a couple of bucks for a color photocopy.

02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:11.720
You cut it out and hand it to a friend and be like, there you go.

02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:16.720
Because the staff didn't care as long as they saw the badge and looked like an actual badge.

02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:21.720
That's true. That's true. You know what?

02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:27.720
A lot of those conventions have like outsource security or like, you know, going through like temp agency security.

02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:31.720
And I know this firsthand at a convention that I went to.

02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:34.720
I'm not sure if I should. What the hell? It's that kind of night.

02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:38.720
It was Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest in Vegas at the Paris.

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:48.720
A friend of mine paid security to get into the show, even though he couldn't get a badge because badges had been sold out for, you know, they got sold out in five minutes.

02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:50.720
He really wanted to go. He tried to get a badge online.

02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:55.720
He was like, you know what? I'm going to go and I'm going to pay a security guard to let me in. Fucking worked.

02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:59.720
Because they don't pay their security enough and they outsource it.

02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:08.720
That's true. I know people who have bought bootleg Comic-Con badges that still work with the RFID tags.

02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:12.720
Okay. All right. And I'm telling you this now.

02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:25.720
When E3 2023 rolls around and RePop will say, you know, we're doing it for the public, within not even 15 minutes, you will see eBay listings for those badges.

02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:30.720
You will hear the people complain. And you know what RePop is going to do?

02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:39.720
They're just going to count their money and be like, well, I'm really sorry this has happened, but good luck next time, you know, as they count them dollars.

02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:50.720
And I know it wasn't here bashing this company, but you know what? We're not really bashing this company. We're speaking the truth here.

02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:55.720
We're talking from our own personal experiences where this company really don't care because they got their bottom line.

02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:04.720
There's a reason why I know people who worked at RePop that started Comic-Con and the anime convention left and did their own thing.

02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:06.720
And we're pretty good with it.

02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:09.720
We didn't boil the tea. We just served it.

02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:10.720
Yup.

02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:12.720
It's piping hot.

02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:19.720
Anyway, let's see. Anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?

02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:22.720
Oh, no. Oh, no. That's it.

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:30.720
You want me to spill anything else tonight? Because apparently once you hit that 20 year mark as a podcast, I need that thing for my mug or something.

02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:38.720
I need a coffee mug that says too old to give a fuck because that's clearly where I've hit at my 20 year mark.

02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:49.720
I've said this countless times on my own show and to other people. I completely, as the song goes, I'm completely out of fucks to give.

02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:56.720
As long as I can get up every day and live my life, do what I have to do and collect my paycheck, we go there.

02:05:56.720 --> 02:06:04.720
It's like the picture, behold the field in which I grow my fucks. Lay thine eyes upon it and see that it is barren.

02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:10.720
And I will say I love the preaching from the pulpit tonight. Loved it. Loved it.

02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.720
I'm waiting for the collection plate to go around one more time so I can throw some more bits in there.

02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:23.720
You know, Reverend Rob, Reverend Loki and Reverend Jamie. Preach on. Preach on.

02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:27.720
Welcome to the PTL podcast network.

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:34.720
The Church of Orange Lounge Radio. A lot of day gamers, OK?

02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:40.720
PTB. Pay them biddies. Get you one step closer to that E3.

02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:43.720
That's going to suck anyway.

02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:44.720
Too much metal for one hand.

02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:45.720
All right.

02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:50.720
Rama, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can, I don't know, spill some more tea. We'll see what happens.

02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:52.720
All right. Take care of my friend.

02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:53.720
Take care too.

02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:54.720
All right. Bye.

02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:55.720
Bye.

02:06:55.720 --> 02:06:58.720
You know what happens when you spill the tea that's too hot?

02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:01.720
Someone's going to get burned.

02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:06.720
I might for opening my big mouth tonight, but you know what?

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:10.720
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:12.720
You didn't. You did not.

02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:16.720
So if the truth bothers you. Sorry to hear that.

02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:23.720
Well, on top of that, if you see something and you think someone's talking about you, well, if the shoe fits.

02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:26.720
Just saying.

02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:31.720
Or even if the shoe doesn't fit, perhaps you need a shoe horn.

02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:39.720
Either you think everything is about you or you're guilty about something. That's it.

02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:45.720
Anyway, let's see. Do we have anything in the mail bag?

02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:46.720
No.

02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:49.720
OK, well, here's the real tea.

02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:54.720
I swear we're getting rid of that segment if we don't get some emails on a regular basis.

02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:59.720
Or I guess let me ask this. Let me let me let me say instead of making threats because I'm in that kind of mood tonight.

02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:02.720
I do love the listeners. I love all of you that show up every week.

02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:04.720
I love those of you that listen to the podcast feed.

02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:08.720
And I know there's many of you that listen and you never say a thing to us.

02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:12.720
And that's that's OK. You know what? Lurkers are fine. We still love you.

02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:15.720
How would you all like to interact with this program?

02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:19.720
What could we do? And especially like the live folks.

02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:23.720
I'm here in them because we got the chat. We got the calls. We got all that.

02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:29.720
How would the people on the podcast feed like to be heard? Because I'm I'm feeling like emails ain't it.

02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:31.720
How would the people. Yeah. Go ahead.

02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:35.720
If you want to tweet something and have me read it.

02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:40.720
Just tap. Just do a hashtag orange lounge radio.

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:42.720
Send it to at OLR.

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:46.720
I was like, I can give you the log in for OLR. I should have a long time ago and you can just.

02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:50.720
Well, I mean, but if you if you do use the hashtag, I'll see it anyway.

02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:51.720
No, that's true.

02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:58.720
So use the hashtag, you know, or yeah, just Orange Lounge Radio or OLR.

02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:03.720
You know, hopefully it won't be mixed in with like some other group called OLR.

02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:08.720
But we get we get weird shit that's like for some school, some some private school.

02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:15.720
Do it for Orange Lounge Radio. Just one word and I'll see it and I'll read it and judge you.

02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:20.720
I mean, listen to your opinions very, very seriously.

02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:24.720
All right. Folks in chat, dark to see us as bring back the Twitter segment. All right.

02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:28.720
Done. We will. You got it. Twitter segment.

02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:30.720
Your tweets at OLR.

02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:33.720
I'll use it. Yeah.

02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:40.720
All right. Yeah, we'd love to. I mean, I know I might be sound like I'm not trying to sound mean or there's just I know we really we really want to hear from people.

02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:44.720
It's every where every gamer has a voice and, you know, trying to get more voices here on the air.

02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:51.720
So, yeah, I know tweets are probably easy emails. I think the reality is how often do I send emails anymore?

02:09:51.720 --> 02:10:00.720
I said the show roll out like if I look at my sandbox in my email, it's like the last 12 weeks of show rolls and maybe one other little thing mixed in here and there.

02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:02.720
Like there's very little that I email.

02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:17.720
Did I send I mean, I my email at work is a different story, but I have so many mail rules set up to put stuff in trash to archive other stuff, to move it into other folders, to save my receipts to another folder.

02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:22.720
You know that I actually had a clean inbox.

02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:25.720
Because of my mail rules.

02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:28.720
If you don't know how to use mail rules, learn. It's great.

02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:31.720
Bobby Blackall says Rob sent me stuff about Dragon Con.

02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:37.720
Yeah, because, you know, for the fourth year in a row, they didn't want to process our credit card.

02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:39.720
I just can't stop talking tonight.

02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:42.720
But that originally came in on emails.

02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:44.720
So, yeah, I just forwarded the email. It's easy.

02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:51.720
But yeah, if I really want your attention, Bobby, I just go to Discord like I usually do.

02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:57.720
So, easiest way to send IMs back and forth or if people, people, people, Twitter.

02:10:57.720 --> 02:10:59.720
People sit on Discord more often these days.

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:02.720
Twitter is actually a great place to get a hold of me, quite honestly.

02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:03.720
I do use Twitter too much.

02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:10.720
And I'm very happy that Twitter is not going to end up turning to the dark side after all.

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:12.720
Thank God, Lex Luthor.

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:14.720
We all knew this would happen. Fucking.

02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:22.720
And Bobby, I am sure that people understand sarcasm and if not, oops.

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:26.720
Yeah. Yeah, hopefully people get our sense of humor by now.

02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:30.720
But just to be clear, we're really nice. We promise.

02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:35.720
First of all, we don't get new people. Sometimes we do.

02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:36.720
We do.

02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:42.720
I really, I really want to, would like to have some new blood.

02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:45.720
It will be nice to get back out to events again.

02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:48.720
You know, California Extreme is a thing.

02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:54.720
I really am biting my tongue on something because it's coming soon here locally.

02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:56.720
And I'm going to just bite my tongue on that.

02:11:56.720 --> 02:11:57.720
I'll talk to you off air about that.

02:11:57.720 --> 02:11:59.720
But that's something.

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:04.720
And then, you know, getting to go to Dragon Con and see people there again.

02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:09.720
It's just be nice to get out and talk about the stuff we like again.

02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:11.720
TwitchCon will be huge too, I think.

02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:17.720
All right, let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:19.720
Nope, nothing.

02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:20.720
Fair enough.

02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:24.720
Well, I think we're getting towards the end of the show then.

02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:27.720
So this is the part of the show where we go around and check on final thoughts.

02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:31.720
Thank you so much for participating with the show tonight.

02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:35.720
You know, as we say, even if you're lurking, we still, we do love you.

02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:37.720
And thank you for being here. You're still a part of the family.

02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:40.720
We just, we just, we're just cordially inviting you to speak up to.

02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:42.720
So, you know, you can send us an email.

Participate at orange.radio.com or a tweet at OLR.

02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:49.720
Or you can, of course, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:52.720
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:54.720
But we need more voices here.

02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:56.720
Everybody is welcome at the tea table.

02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:58.720
We have, it's very easy to make more tea.

02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:00.720
We'll make tea for everybody.

02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:05.720
So invite some friends to come and some enemies to come check out the show with you next time.

02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:09.720

So, okay, I think that's it.

02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:31.720
Let's go around and get everybody's final.

02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:32.720
Oh, hey.

02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:33.720
We have Dozilla.

02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:34.720
Look at that.

02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:35.720
Dozilla.

02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:37.720
Been listening to the show since 2006.

02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:39.720
Don't think I've ever chatted.

02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:40.720
Welcome, Dozilla.

02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:41.720
Welcome.

02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:42.720
I am happy to see you chatting.

02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:44.720
That legit made me smile.

02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:45.720
Thank you for that.

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:46.720
I really appreciate that.

02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:47.720
You know what?

02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:48.720
You know what?

02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:49.720
You know what?

02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:50.720
Hold on.

02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:51.720
Hold on.

02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:52.720
Hold on.

02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:53.720
I'm going to do a thing.

02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:54.720
Okay.

02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:55.720
There we go.

02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:56.720
I'm doing a thing now.

02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:57.720
Okay.

02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:58.720
All right.

02:13:58.720 --> 02:13:59.720
There you go.

02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:00.720
There you go.

02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:01.720
Dozilla.

02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:02.720
The thing has been done.

02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:03.720
Is it Dozilla or Dozilla?

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:06.720
Thanks, DarkSakura.

02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:07.720
That's nice.

02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:10.720
Now you can go back and catch up on all the videos from prior weeks.

02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:12.720
There you go.

02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:13.720
Love that.

02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:14.720
All right.

02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:15.720
Let's go.

02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:16.720
Okay.

02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:17.720
Dozilla.

02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:18.720
Noted.

02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:19.720
Okay.

02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:20.720
I was right.

02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:22.720
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:26.720
So, DarkSakura can go Zilla and do her DBD stream.

02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:27.720
So, DarkSakura.

02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:28.720
Go, Godzilla, go.

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:30.720
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:32.720
What's your final thought tonight?

02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:41.720
I am trying so hard to hit 500 followers that it's like I have seven people to go.

02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:42.720
I'm so close.

02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:43.720
You got this.

02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:44.720
So, wish me luck.

02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:45.720
You got this.

02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:49.720
It's just going to take that right raid to land at the right time.

02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:50.720
So, I hope you get it tonight.

02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:52.720
I've been getting stranger raids and that's been-

02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:53.720
That's great.

02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:55.720
Not hate raids, like actual real people raids.

02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:56.720
Good, good.

02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:57.720
All right.

02:14:57.720 --> 02:14:58.720
Well, I'm ready.

02:14:58.720 --> 02:14:59.720
All right.

02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:00.720
Take care, DarkSakura.

02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:01.720
We'll see you next week.

02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:02.720
We'll see you later tonight and then next week.

02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:03.720
All right.

02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:05.720
Loki, your final thought for us tonight?

02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:10.720
I'm only 13 away from 500 subscribers on my YouTube channel.

02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:12.720
So, that'll happen eventually.

02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:13.720
Okay.

02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:18.720
I feel bad because I passed 500, but I've had my account since it was just in TV.

02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:21.720
So, I've had a long time to build that up.

02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:23.720
So, in all fairness, yeah.

02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:26.720
So, I'm waiting for 1,000 now.

02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:28.720
We'll see, but I have to stream more to do it.

02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:32.720
My final thought is, unfortunately, like it's going to be a lot harder to stream this week.

02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:37.720
I have a really big high profile thing at work and I have to commute to another office to do it.

02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:39.720
So, but I mean, it's great.

02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:40.720
I love my job.

02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:41.720
I love what I do.

02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:46.720
I love this opportunity, but it's going to cut into my evenings a little bit because I'm not going to be getting home until 7, 7.30 at night.

02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:49.720
And then by the time I get home, it's like, okay, eat dinner, go to bed.

02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:53.720
So, yeah, but it'll be a good week.

02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:55.720
So, but I hope I get to play some games.

02:15:55.720 --> 02:16:03.720
Probably a lot of location games because I'll get to play location games in a new town while I'm waiting for the traffic to die down.

02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:05.720
So, all right, that's it, everybody.

02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:07.720
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:08.720
Thank you for being here.

02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:10.720
Have a wonderful week, everybody.

02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:11.720
We'll see you next time.

02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:13.720
