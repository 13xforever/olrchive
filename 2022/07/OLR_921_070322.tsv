0	30000	This week, ZeniMax enters the crunch culture conversation with accusations against management over working employees. Head of Xbox Game Studios, Matt Butte disputes the accusations with accurate deflection and lack of emphasis on the important details, rightly stating that the reports were about Fallout 76 and Skyrim, which Xbox Game Studios had no organizational ownership stake in. But there's more. I can't read the whole article in this intro.
30000	37360	But your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki will bring you more details on this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
61000	68760	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week with my co-hosts say hello and say wow wig to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
69000	69920	What do you mean wig?
70440	72640	This is your real hair? You don't wear wigs?
73400	91160	I got I got no it's not my real hair. I would not be blonde on purpose except via a wig. Although I mean, I'm actually rather surprised at how well the blonde works. I never thought that I would be I would look okay as blonde.
91640	107160	If I knew you were gonna wear a wig tonight, I would have worn a wig too. But the only wig I have is my Yvette wig from when I played Yvette and Clue a few months ago. So it would have been a little, little, little silly, but fun. So maybe next time.
108000	113040	How about I loan you some of my you know, three dozen wigs.
113160	121280	Sounds good. At some point, we'll have a wig night. And I'd love to see how tech master Loki would respond to wig night. Hi, Loki.
122160	124360	Don't own any wigs. So that can't work.
124400	125720	Well, DarkSakura has a collection.
125720	131440	I just offered to loan wigs out. I'll give you something like in a steel blue.
132160	137440	Would you would you at least consider doing like one of those stupid hats with a built in mullet or something?
138840	139360	Sure.
140000	140560	Okay, yeah.
140600	141520	There we go. Hat mullet.
141760	149360	That's, that's about as close as we're gonna get Loki to do that. Hello. Hello. What's the gameplay behind you tonight, Loki?
149880	154840	It's I think called in the deep. It looks like metal slug, but with a submarine.
154920	158760	I was gonna say it looks like something out of like the Genesis era. But okay, like a Neo Geo.
158760	160520	It's an arcade game.
160600	166160	Oh, okay. I like that. Very cool. Orange right in chat says in the hunt is what that is.
166200	170400	Oh, is in the hunt. My mistake. I couldn't see it behind my head. So
171680	177400	I had the the name like, I had it. You remembered a second ago, but like I couldn't see it.
177560	189480	All good. And of course, the comments coming in live because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six six o'clock Pacific at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash v o g network or voice of geeks network.
190080	201200	Nine Eastern six Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, Bobby back tonight after his trip over to summer games done quick, which he talked a lot about on his show tonight.
201200	218040	So obviously, I'm going to give his show a plug. He talked a little bit about kind of what it was like to be there in person, because even though he's been involved with summer games done, or excuse me, with the games done quick organization since 2020 as a volunteer, for obvious reasons, this is the first time that he was able to go live and in person.
218280	237000	And it was also very interesting to me as a bystander just seeing how seriously they took precautions at GDQ. Holy goodness. And one story I'll spoil from Bobby show is he was saying that there was a nurses convention that was happening at the exact same hotel out there in the think of the Minneapolis area.
237000	263400	There was a nurses convention happening on the ground floor, and they were upstairs or something. And that the mass compliance at games done quick was better than the nurses convention where it sounds like it was slim to none from what it sounds like. So that is pretty interesting. And then you see the arcade and everything spaced out. So that's that's the way to have a convention right now in 2022. Are you listening Anime Expo? I don't think they are
263840	272840	that that's very interesting. The max policy. But what I really want to know is if anybody made the joke when the nurses walked by and said, Hello, nurse.
273720	302480	I'm sure somebody had to, I would hope I would have. See, SSU 100 Mountain Chat says, Yeah, summer games done quick won't be a super spreader, but the detractors won't listen. There's just gonna be people that you kind of have to look at it that the pandemic has affected people in many ways. And major distrust of crowds of people is a pretty big thing for a lot of people at this point. And there's a part of me that kind of gets it. I kind of think on
302480	332160	social media, people kind of have a blank check to run wild. Sometimes, I think there is a line that has to be walked for many people. Like I went to Dragon Con last year. I went in part for the mental health component. Like I there's a lot about the in person and seeing the people that I really needed back in my life. And the fact that Dragon Con took the stuff seriously and you know, had the requirements they did and had pretty decent compliance, I'd say about like 90 95% compliance. And most people I saw was wearing
332160	361760	masks and stuff. It did. It wasn't a super spreader event. And I guarantee you games done quick is not going to be a spreader event of any sort. Yeah, some people had COVID. But like they brought it in from like having already been sick or it was the fucking flights. Because if anything is a super spreader event, it's airplanes right now. So I would say that games done quick was really a lesson from what I'm observing and how to do this shit right moving forward. And I'm fairly confident the number of COVID
361760	377080	cases that were transmitted at games done quick are going to be slim to none. And if they're slim, it's going to be because like so and so and so and so went to Arby's together outside the hotel or whatever. And it was that sort of thing and not at the actual convention. So
377080	398960	um, this is your 100. Matt and chat says I went to magfest for the same reasons. We all have to just live our lives the best and comfortably as we can just have to assume everyone will do all the right things going in and afterwards. Yeah, I mean, the the opportunity to rid the world of COVID past, we failed, society failed to get rid of COVID when they could. So now it's
400080	403240	I will say that I don't think there was any getting rid of it anyway.
403240	415600	Probably not. Just to the just to the nature of Coronaviruses themselves. It did exactly what it was expected to do, which is evolve, and become weaker.
415600	445600	And, you know, I, I think you kind of look at the areas that were doing COVID precautions really well, like New Zealand, let's say, you know, in the beginning, they were doing really well. But now it's kind of hit the point where it's like they're kind of in the same boat as everyone else. And that's just what it is now. And it sucks. I don't mean to sound complacent with it. But thank gosh, the science has evolved in two and a half years, because I think we've been able to make a lot of progress and how to treat how to, you know, you know, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid
445600	475600	of COVID, how to vaccinate, you know, and all this other stuff. It's just vaccine has that kind of invokes that most people feel vaccines prevent diseases, because the vaccines that you get as a kid for months, rubella, most of us got vaccinated as a kid, and it was not a big fucking deal at all, because everybody knew these diseases were serious, you get vaccinated, you don't get them, you get the vaccine, you don't get them. And I think it causes a mental thing with a lot of people because like you get a vaccine, but you can still get this. But it's just the
475600	505600	vaccines help mitigate the damage, right? So I don't know. Maybe I'm not one to speak on it because I still have not had COVID as far as I know. Maybe I've had it and I'm unaware. Hmm. Remember the thing with COVID is exactly like getting the flu shot. It's going to be that you are vaccinated against that strain of it. And with an illness that's constantly mutating, the vaccines are working against the
505600	535600	strain they're created for. Yes. I run, ironically, in many ways, COVID is the flu now. How ironic, but obviously, there are differences. I don't mean to draw a little alignment still. Yeah, the flu can kill people. Yeah, yeah. A cold can kill people, you know, and a cold is, again, another kind of Coronavirus. So people need to look back and and not simplify the science of it.
535600	565600	And look at the big picture. It's something that one has to pay attention to holistically. Yeah. And although now there there's a research thinking that they know what's causing long COVID and how to combat that. That's great. And that's that's the type of advances that are going to help people be more comfortable when weighing the risk. Because let's be real, I'm going to go to Dragon Con this year. I'm already scheduled for four panels. And it's very likely being where Dragon Con is, there's probably not going to be a lot of
565600	595600	precautions this year. I'm hopeful that there will be. There's probably not going to be. So I'm going to Twitch Con. Yeah, same thing, right? And it's like, well, I'm masking. Yeah, Twitch being in, yeah, and masks will always be optional. And that's probably something I'll still continue to do at Dragon Con. And yeah, Twitch Con might be able to do some weird things. But also the way things are in October, even Labor Day, the way things are then versus the way they are now, this thing changes on a on a daily basis, you know,
595600	625600	it's it's wild. Bobby in chat says, all this talking about Summer Games Done Quick and his participation in that has been great for my mental health. I wasn't doing well in late 2020. I was medically healthy, but not mentally healthy. I'm both medically and mentally healthy right now. And I from the mental health perspective, I can speak in a similar place. I was not in a great place either in 2020. Mentally, I'm doing better. But then I had this whole interesting type two diabetes thing that I've had to
625600	655600	deal with, which I, I don't know, like, again, I am convinced the vast majority of diabetes is genetic period, you have to be disposed genetically to have this. But I think there is a certain element of element of it that was rushed because of the depression I had in 2020 in dealing with the pandemic. So there there are also with type two diabetes, genetics are a big component of it because my family has a disposition. But also diet and lifestyle do play a very large
655600	685600	factor in it. Yeah. And both of those things were shit in 2020 and 2021. And thankfully, I was diagnosed right around the time things started to get better at like, because it was a month after Dragon Con. So I was able to make the changes I needed to make. And you know, what am I how many pounds am I down today? I think 52 pounds is how many how much weight I've lost so far on this, which, you know, you lost all those pounds. Is there a joke you're setting up here?
685600	715600	Because I found them all.
715600	745600	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
745600	775600	Yeah, yeah
775600	805600	Yeah, yeah
805600	835600	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
835600	836600	Yeah.
836600	839980	Actually, I'll go ahead and go on record. I gained back about five pounds.
839980	840980	Okay, that's-
840980	853920	But I've also, now I haven't been in a good place for like the last few months. But I
853920	855660	have been lifting my weights again.
855660	856660	Good.
856660	863900	And there's just something about making yourself sore that's a little cathartic. It's like,
863900	867580	take that body. You're gonna feel better and you're gonna like it.
867580	868580	Yeah.
868580	869580	So-
869580	870580	It was-
870580	873820	And then I get to walk around like a badass when I'm done.
873820	878720	Forcing myself to go that first mile and interrupt my day to do it was the hardest step and then
878720	885360	everything was kind of downhill from there. So anyway, let's talk about games because
885360	890780	believe it or not, it is a gaming podcast. So when we're sick, we play a lot of video
890780	896220	games while we're trying to recover. Let's talk about what's happened in the gaming world
896220	902400	this week. Actually, quick first, sorry. I do want to just say thank you everybody for
902400	907700	a really wonderful show last week, celebrating our 20th anniversary. We had a little bit
907700	913120	of a typical show because we really just spent the entire three and a half plus hours is
913120	919980	what it clocked in as, talking about us. And not just us, but the last 20 years of gaming
919980	924820	history, our show and everything we've kind of seen over the last 20 years, the good,
924820	929580	bad, and the ugly, all of it. And I really want to thank everybody for participating
929580	934660	in that show. Not just my co-host of course, but just everybody in the Twitch chat and
934660	938560	so forth. And I'm sure many of you that listen on the podcast feed as well, thank you for
938560	942760	checking it out. And I've seen some tweets and things like that. So just thank you. We
942760	946480	will get to some more towards the end of the show tonight because we never did emails last
946480	950820	week. And we never did tweets or any of that stuff. So I want to do some of that tonight.
950820	955080	But we'll get to that later in the show. But I just want to say thank you. And here we
955080	961520	go, year 21. So Loki, why don't you start us off with a wrap up of kind of the big headline
961520	962520	from the week, right?
962520	967740	Yeah, so it was a partner showcase for the Nintendo Direct Mini. So they were showing
967740	972440	off a bunch of different third party games. So some of the different trailers that they
972440	979720	had Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak, which is going to that came out on June 30.
979720	983560	Do you know something? You have something weird Monster Hunter Sunbreak though. I'm
983560	987920	going to say this because I've seen Shane tweeting about it. And he's right. Not a lot
987920	993740	of people are noticing this, that amiibo figure that was supposed to come out that was like
993740	999440	a GameStop exclusive here in the US. I think it did come out in Europe and Japan. It didn't
999440	1004860	show up here after all. And it is suddenly disappeared from the website. Even talking
1004860	1009180	about the collector's edition or whatever it was did come with an amiibo. But the collector's
1009180	1014020	edition even advertises these other amiibo. You can't get them in the US. And like it's
1014020	1019800	not being reported on in the media. Because I guess there's no headline to copy paste.
1019800	1023700	But I thought that was very interesting. What Shane kind of brought light to there because
1023700	1027200	he's big on the Monster Hunter series and amiibo collecting and he was like, Do you
1027200	1031640	know these things just disappeared completely? And GameStop never got them in and they're
1031640	1035280	not going to. I thought that was very interesting. Anyway, sorry.
1035280	1042280	Maybe they'll probably just like suddenly come out later on without any fanfare.
1042280	1049160	Hopefully not an exclusive to one store because I'm never a fan of that. But yeah, yeah.
1049160	1055720	So what else? We had the Nier Automata, the end of a Euro edition, which is going to be
1055720	1059480	including all the DLC kind of your Game of the Year edition type thing.
1059480	1063720	That's impressive that they got Nier Automata running on the Switch. I mean, but at the
1063720	1070840	same time, it was a PS4 Xbox One game and that is about the power in the Switch. So
1070840	1075400	it's not too surprising, but it's still neat.
1075400	1083320	Yep. This weird looking game that's Lorelei and the laser eyes.
1083320	1091040	It's a puzzle game by the devs who did Sayonara Wild Hearts and that's coming out next year.
1091040	1094440	This is surprising because I think we were just joking about it the other day about like,
1094440	1099440	oh, Konami is not doing anything with their properties. Super Bomberman R2 is coming
1099440	1101240	out now on the Nintendo Switch.
1101240	1105360	I'm glad the one release that worked out for them, they're going to make a sequel to.
1105360	1110280	Yeah. So that's the retro collections have done very well. So I shouldn't speak too much
1110280	1115040	out of turn. I'm glad they're one like new thing is getting a sequel.
1115040	1121080	Something that came out of nowhere, Megaman Battle Network Legacy Collection. So it's
1121080	1126160	a collection of 10 of the was that they were portable games, if I remember correctly, for
1126160	1128200	the Gameboy Advance.
1128200	1132520	I could hear Ranma celebrating all the way out here when that got announced. But that
1132520	1137960	is a really cool announcement. I mean, it is it's in the same kind of family as, you
1137960	1142120	know, they did a Megaman one through six collection and I think it was seven through
1142120	1145240	10. And I think that didn't they do the X Games at some point? They put all that in
1145240	1150840	a collection too. And so I think this is like, what else can we squeeze out of Megaman into
1150840	1151840	a collection?
1151840	1156640	But Capcom is also pretty big on these collection games lately, right? Fighters collection just
1156640	1158440	came out not that long ago, right?
1158440	1161400	It's making the money. It's probably a very minimal effort.
1161400	1167640	It is. And also, they've been pretty decent collections, all things considered. So, yeah,
1167640	1169960	I think that the that's exciting about that.
1169960	1175960	DJ Ranma S is actually in chat and says, I lost my proverbial shit at work. Seriously.
1175960	1177240	So cannot wait.
1177240	1184280	Ooh, good call from Orange, right? Who says one more step towards the Legends collection.
1184280	1185280	I hope that
1185280	1190480	Hardly a collection with two games. Or I guess there's misadventures of Tron Bonn. But like,
1190480	1191480	yeah,
1191480	1193480	put Tron Bonn in there too.
1193480	1194480	Three.
1195320	1196320	Sure.
1196320	1200320	Hey, you know what? It's enough to grab a headline.
1200320	1210400	Sure. What else? We have the Pac-Man World Repack, which I don't know if that's a new
1210400	1211400	game.
1211400	1220160	It's a remaster of game. Yeah. Complete with Pac-Mom instead of Ms. Pac-Man. Because Pac-Man
1220160	1222640	got a new woman.
1222640	1223640	Pac-Mom.
1223640	1234120	Uh, there's a game called Blank, which is like this kind of monochrome. It almost looks
1234120	1240880	like, you know, without yeah, it kind of the the art style reminds me a little bit of Calvin
1240880	1246520	and Hobbes. But, you know, obviously not Calvin and Hobbes. And that's coming out on the switch
1246520	1249800	February 2023. They had
1249800	1254280	a quick comment. Sorry, from Elliot B. in our chat who says, by the way, good to see
1254280	1255760	you, who says, I always
1255760	1260600	Oh, I thought it was Blonk. Like white.
1260600	1261600	Yeah.
1261600	1262600	I'm sorry.
1262600	1264600	I thought you said blank.
1264600	1265600	Oh.
1265600	1266600	No. Blonk.
1266600	1267600	Okay.
1267600	1271160	Elliot B. in our chat says, I always wanted to check out Battle Network when I had a GBA.
1271160	1275640	It always looks so cool. Yeah. And you know what? There are 10 games in that collection.
1275640	1279480	Now granted, it's a little bit of fuzzy math because like they started to do the Pokemon
1279480	1284100	thing where there's like, you know, red and blue. But still, I think there's six, six
1284100	1287840	truly unique games in that series. And so that's a pretty meaty collection that they're
1287840	1294520	putting together there, which is pretty cool. Also, talking about the Pac-Man, DGRama-esque
1294520	1300360	says Pac-MILF is the new mommy in the game there. So sure. All right.
1300360	1305880	I thought it, but I didn't say it because, you know, that's ridiculous.
1305880	1310160	I know. Anyway, moving on. Other announcements from Nintendo Direct.
1310160	1314640	Return to Monkey Island is going to be coming to the Switch as well. So we basically same
1314640	1320780	trailer that's been shown already. I'm very much looking forward to that. We have Mario
1320780	1328040	plus Rabbids Sparks of Hope, and they teased that Bowser is going to be in this as well.
1328040	1335360	So that's pretty neat. That's coming out in October. Little Noah Sign of Paradise, which
1335360	1344080	is an RPG by the folks who made Dragalia Lost. This game called Rail Grade, which
1344080	1349920	is, I guess, a, I don't know, it's like a survival game with a train. It's kind of neat
1349920	1360480	looking. RPG Time, The Legend of Wright. And this is coming out on August 18th. It's like
1360480	1365920	a hand-drawn characters. Almost looks like, remember how we saw the other storybook game,
1365920	1372700	but I think less, you know, the hand-drawn stuff, more kind of like, oh, like Papercraft
1372700	1383080	almost looking. And then Sonic Frontiers coming to the Switch. Cool. That game we saw, I think
1383080	1394660	this was, this may have been during Key 3, but Disney Dreamlight Valley. It's that free
1394660	1400960	to play game. I think that's coming out. That's kind of like the Sims almost. So that's going
1400960	1409160	to be out September 6th. Live Live got a demo, if I remember correctly, and that's also coming
1409160	1416200	out here in a few weeks. I need you to grab that. I forgot to grab that. Doraemon Story
1416200	1423240	of Seasons, Friends of the Great Kingdom. That's pretty cool again. And that's apparently
1423240	1429180	a sequel to the Doraemon Story of Seasons game. And that's coming out later this year.
1429180	1433960	We had a trailer for Minecraft Legends again, and that's, you know, obviously coming out
1433960	1441360	later this year as well. Dragon Quest Treasures, which is a spinoff of the Dragon Quest series
1441360	1445640	that has treasure hunting in it. I mean, I think we could figure that out based on the
1445640	1451360	title and that's coming out December 9th of this year. Well, Dragon Quest has had success
1451360	1456500	with the Builders spinoff, so I'm not surprised that it's kind of, it's interesting that it's
1456500	1459680	following a very similar thing with Minecraft where it's all these different spinoff games
1459680	1465920	all of a sudden, but it's cool. I'd check it out. Yeah, it's like a, I don't know if it's like a
1465920	1469960	loot RPG type thing or something like that. They don't really show much in the trailer,
1469960	1475640	but. Portal Companion Collection. Sorry, Darktids uses, I think they announced Treasures
1475640	1480280	previously. I think it's a Dragon Quest XI spinoff. I had no idea. I missed it. Somehow it wasn't on
1480280	1486560	my radar. Too many games, not enough time. The Portal Companion Collection with Portal 1 and 2.
1486600	1492680	That's going to be coming out, I think later this year. Oh no, I'm sorry. That was out today. That
1492680	1498400	was one of those, it's out today. Well, it was out like 15 years ago, but sure, sure. Why not
1498400	1502840	on the Switch? Well, it's out today on the Switch. They're classic games. Why not? It's not real
1502840	1511960	gaming until you play it on Switch. Harvest Della, which is, I guess, a similar game to
1512280	1518800	Rune Factory. And that's supposed to be coming out on the Switch November 4th. I mean, definitely
1518800	1528720	the imagery and the graphics look a lot like Rune Factory. Persona 5 Royale is, I guess,
1528720	1535240	a remaster that's coming out on October 21st. And of course, there's also supposed to be ports
1535240	1539240	for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden, which I think we talked about those before. I
1539480	1546480	may have been on the Xbox announcement. And that's, I think, it. Well, that was still a lot of
1546480	1554000	stuff. You just ran through there really quick. But yeah, that was a pretty packed direct. You
1554000	1558880	know, they made sure to clarify it was all third party stuff. So, we know we weren't going to see
1558880	1562280	things like Breath of the Wild 2 or anything like that, although I'm sure some people are still
1562280	1569960	disappointed because the internet is crazy sometimes. But I think it was a nice, pretty
1569960	1576320	meaty show, considering that it wasn't a major direct. You know, it wasn't, you know, one of the
1576320	1582880	Nintendo's, they called it a mini, basically. It was pretty maxi for a mini. So.
1584640	1591720	I still think Sonic for Tears looks so boring. I don't know what it is about that. Like, it just
1591720	1597800	does not show well. I think I need to see, like, streamers playing that game or just, I think I
1597800	1602120	need to see what the game, like, really truly looks like in motion from real people in order
1602120	1608120	to be able to make, like, an accurate judgment on it or get my hands on it or get hands on it
1608120	1616440	myself, obviously. But yeah, I just. I'm not really enthused so far by what I'm seeing,
1617080	1620280	considering all the hype behind the whole open world thing, but we'll see.
1622280	1624680	Yeah. Go ahead. Just a second.
1624680	1630280	Oh, I was just saying, I just popped on Nintendo's channel on the site, and they're
1630280	1636120	apparently having a sale through the seventh. Yeah, there's a lot of places having a long,
1636120	1639960	you know, because it's a holiday, even though there's nothing worth celebrating this year.
1639960	1644520	Technically, it's a holiday, so there's a lot of sales going on right now. So yeah, Nintendo's one
1644520	1648920	of them. Steam's wrapping up their, if they didn't already, their summer sale's coming to an end
1648920	1655320	pretty soon. I know Battle.net's been having one, like, I'm sure Epic Games. Well, they did
1655320	1658840	one earlier, so I'm not sure they're running one right now, but there's a lot of sites having a
1658840	1664520	sale. So yeah, Nintendo's even on that too. And the rare first party games even on sale with that.
1664520	1668680	So there's a lot of stuff you can catch up on because Nintendo games, like, never go on sale,
1668680	1672600	even if they're like five years old. It's very interesting. Yeah. So.
1672600	1675400	But I mean, I'll put it this way. They're barely on sale.
1675400	1679560	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a $50 game is down to like $35.
1681160	1683560	Yeah. They're calling it the super sale.
1683560	1687080	Yeah. It's not, yeah. It's not going to be like Steam where it's like,
1687080	1691240	I picked up a game for $2 that's normally like $45. So yeah.
1691240	1692440	But it's through Tuesday.
1694360	1700680	SSJ100Matt says Prime Day is apparently July 12th through 13th, so everyone is running sales soon to
1700680	1706200	try to get in front of that. That makes sense. Elliot B. in chat says I got inside on Switch
1706200	1711400	for $2. Well worth it. And that is a good reminder is that there's not just the Nintendo first party
1711400	1716280	games, but there's a whole lot of indies on the Switch store that oftentimes have a hard time
1716280	1722360	getting spotlighted on that store. So the sales really call attention to certain things there. So
1722360	1725720	I'm good call on that. The game I wanted to play is actually
1725720	1728680	down to 30 bucks and that was Persona 5 Strikers.
1728680	1730680	Oh, yeah. It's worth checking out.
1731320	1733800	Yeah. So I think I'm adding it to my list.
1734360	1739000	Good call. All right. Well, since we're talking about games we're going to be playing,
1739000	1742760	let's talk about games we have been playing in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week?
1742760	1745000	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?
1746600	1752440	Of course I've been playing Dead by Daylight. I actually have started, well, I mean,
1752440	1757880	I mentioned this already, but I've been playing Survivor and I haven't hated it.
1759240	1765080	And indeed it's actually been a lot more fun than I thought it would be because I've had friends
1765080	1774600	playing with me. I've been playing mostly with Finara, who we've seen in our chat many, many
1774600	1783640	times, who was also my roommate in college and one of my best friends, like family level best
1784600	1791640	friend. And then I've played with you some, Rob, and that was fun. And just the other day I played
1791640	1797400	with Craigle, another streamer friend. And I'm going to be joining on the post-show
1797400	1800920	tonight for a little bit after dinner. So I won't be there right away, but after dinner
1800920	1803720	and production of OLR is done, I'll hop in for a little bit.
1803720	1809640	Well, and I'm sure that given that Finara is three hours ahead of us, she'll want to take a break.
1809640	1822440	So it'll be good. But also I finished Terranigma and what a poopy ending.
1824680	1832680	What a poopy ending. I had gotten so into the game and I was so excited about where I thought
1832680	1840440	the ending was going. And then it's like, no. We were comparing it to The Mist, that movie.
1841080	1843240	Did you see that in the theater?
1843240	1847880	I did not see it in the theater, but I'm very aware of how they changed the ending from the book.
1847880	1852200	And even Stephen King was like, this is fucked up what you did. I like it.
1853400	1855320	Well, yeah, but I hated it.
1855320	1857800	No, I know a lot of people did. A lot of people did.
1858280	1867080	Because the movie was awesome. It was so good. And then that's what Terranigma is to me.
1869160	1873800	If you have no idea, by the way, with The Mist, please don't spoil it for yourself.
1873800	1877960	Just watch the movie and send us an email. Participate at orangesontrader.com.
1877960	1879080	And I want you to cuss us out.
1879080	1880680	Then read the book and be mad about it.
1881320	1885640	I want you to cuss us out about how that movie ends.
1886040	1888920	And then be mad about it after you read the book. Just saying.
1891400	1900760	So anyway, when I finished that, I could not get my translated copy of Final Fantasy 6 to work.
1901400	1909480	So I started the American Final Fantasy 3 and I got a bit of the way through it, right at the
1910280	1916920	start. But I did finally get it patched with a translation.
1916920	1920840	Because I own a Japanese copy of it and I own an American copy of it.
1921480	1926840	So I am well within my rights to play a digital recreation of it.
1928440	1931400	I can legally do so because I own both copies.
1932360	1940440	So I will be starting over on that one this Wednesday for Retro Night.
1942360	1945400	And I'm looking forward to seeing what the differences are.
1946920	1954520	It's been so long since I've played the game that there's so many things that I'm remembering and
1954520	1960200	so many things that are kind of new to me again. Just because I didn't remember certain things
1960200	1965400	happening. I mean, this was the game that I basically skipped a week of school for,
1965400	1974920	pretending I had the flu. And I've also found some other ROM hacks that do new stories for
1974920	1981240	Final Fantasy 6. And I'm sort of thinking about doing them, but I'm also thinking about doing
1981240	1986120	Star Ocean after that, because people have requested it. Either that or Emerald Dragon.
1986760	1996120	And then I have to think if I want to play the SNES copy or the Turbo Duo version, or I should
1996120	2003400	say PC Engine Duo. Because I do have the original PC Engine version of the game.
2005960	2011560	So I've got some decisions to make, but I've got time because Final Fantasy 6 is something
2012360	2020040	I can take my sweet time with and explore and see if I can remember all the fun little secrets in
2020040	2028920	it. And of course, I've also been playing wordscapes. And I think I am fairly close
2028920	2038680	to being at, oh gosh, I just hit my lap. Fairly close to being at level 10,000.
2040200	2043640	Wow. Not too far. I love that game. I mean,
2043640	2052360	it's like my perfect kind of stress relief game. And I did just buy Persona 5, so I'm just saying.
2054120	2057960	We'll be hearing about that next week. Maybe if I can get my
2059000	2064680	butt over to actually play something. Oh, and I need to get the Delicious Last Course for Cuphead.
2064680	2068680	So I'm going to do that too. All right. Well, while Dark Soccer
2068680	2072440	fills up her shopping cart, let's go over to Loki and talk about his gaming week.
2073000	2077480	With all Minecraft again. I was very busy this week. I made two videos this week.
2077480	2080520	Yeah, I was going to say you were teasing a big premiere last night, right?
2081320	2088760	Yeah, it was last night that I put out a video. So earlier this week, I finished up my
2088760	2095800	hardcore series. So that was fun. Very chaotic. And then, of course, put out a new episode of
2095800	2101480	Nerd Craft, or not Nerd Craft Channel 64. I'm getting all my S&Ps mixed up. So another episode
2101480	2108120	Channel 64, which I built a giant met for Mega Man. That's my starter base. So it looks awesome.
2109080	2111560	Definitely worth checking out. At least, you know, check out the thumbnail.
2113160	2116040	Yeah, that's pretty much it. I was going to say you can kind of see it,
2116040	2123240	even the thumbnail, like the how gigantic this base is in your latest video. I'm trying to see
2123240	2127880	if I can actually see it in the video somewhere. Like, I think I found it. I think I found it.
2127880	2131640	So Oh, this looks really cool. Actually, hold on, I'm going to show it for those that are watching
2132360	2139400	live on the voice geeks network over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And that's from Loki's latest
2139400	2144760	video, this gigantic base. For those in the podcast feed, it looks like one of those Mega
2144760	2149880	Man two enemies with like the construction hats that spit bullets at you like faithfully recreated
2149880	2156040	in blocks on top of this really just giant base that Loki's working with. And, you know, I know
2156040	2162520	Loki's starter base. Yeah, you talk a lot about Minecraft on this show. But for those that haven't
2162520	2167560	really checked out your YouTube or your it's because you're you're you're really doing a lot
2167560	2172920	with this game. And I mean that I mean that in the nice way, not like in the Wow, he does a lot. No,
2172920	2176280	I mean that in like, you're really invested in this game and in this community.
2177000	2183080	Yeah, definitely. So check that out over at YouTube. Loki underscore o lr. Awesome.
2184040	2190920	All right. I watched some of the older videos not too long ago. It was quite entertaining.
2190920	2194120	Yeah. Believe it or not, look, he'd have some good stuff.
2196600	2201800	Yeah, at least I tried to. Yeah. No, it's good. I'm really happy that
2201800	2208360	things are picking up and up for you, too. So. All right. My gaming week, I had a weird gaming
2208360	2211880	week. I'm going to be the first one to admit. So I've been playing the usual stuff, of course.
2211880	2217880	Final Fantasy 14. I was out doing Pokemon Go today. Nobody told me that collection challenge
2217880	2222440	resulted in a regional. So I'm glad I did it and did some Bluetooth catching today,
2222440	2226840	because then when Panseer showed up, I was like, Wait, what like that? That was the giveaway for
2226840	2230600	this. Hold on. Is that is that the name of that guy? I don't know. Somebody in shadow,
2230600	2235240	correct me if I'm wrong. But yes, that was nice. And then playing, you know, a little bit of
2235240	2239080	Ingress. I hit level 16 again for the third time. I don't know if I ever said that on the show,
2239080	2243400	but I hit 16 for the third time in Ingress. And now I'm kind of slowing down on that. Like I only
2243400	2249000	I only go out and raise havoc if I need to. And then also playing a little bit of Pikmin.
2249000	2253480	Okay. But here's where my week gets weird. So y'all know I have a new computer. So I've been,
2253480	2258360	you know, installing games on it, checking out what's on Game Pass, seeing how games look. And
2258360	2263320	then I was like, I'm gonna go I'm gonna go back in the vault and play some old games. And I really
2263320	2269560	can't explain this, especially when I well know I have a backlog of new games to play. Like I've
2269560	2274120	been meaning to play tunic for like two months now. Everybody's yelling at me to go back and
2274120	2278920	finish like a dragon, especially after this last week in summer games done quick, and all this
2278920	2284200	other stuff. But you know what my brain did? My brain's like, you know what game I want to see
2284200	2291400	on my 4K monitor, really smooth like butter and playing on the PC. I'm gonna go play Elder Scrolls
2291400	2299000	for Oblivion. And that's what I played. And I don't mean like, oh, I fired it up and just like
2299000	2303080	checked out the start screen and then quit. No, no, no. I went through the whole introduction
2303080	2309160	dungeon. I got out into the world. I went around the town selling stuff. I went to the Umbra
2309160	2314200	dungeon to get the Umbra sword. Like I played a significant chunk of Elder Scrolls for Oblivion.
2314200	2321960	And I it's I most of my playtime on that game was on the 360 or the one or whatever. So I hadn't
2321960	2327000	done a lot of like mouse and keyboard play with that game. So that was kind of neat to go back
2327000	2331400	and play that. And it yeah, it looks really pretty. I'm not gonna lie. It's like that's the
2331400	2336600	best this game is ever gonna look. It still looks dated, of course, because that game is like 15.
2336600	2341000	Well, I'm sure you could throw a bunch of mods at it, too. And that is that's what Alan was
2341000	2345640	saying is throw mods at it. And then I'm like, well, hold on, because eventually this is gonna
2345640	2354360	happen with Skyrim. So we'll get there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then the other game, I randomly went
2354360	2359960	back in the archives and started playing. So I was playing Diablo, Diablo Immortal for a hot minute.
2359960	2364600	Didn't spend any money on it. I didn't like that. That was a yes. Yes, I've heard all the stories
2364600	2370600	about it. I checked it out. But then I was like, you know, the only thing with Diablo Immortal is
2370600	2376680	that because they didn't design it for the PC, they designed it for a mobile phone. When you
2376680	2381640	play it on PC, it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't look good because it's running through an Android
2381640	2386920	emulator, I'm pretty sure. So it just looks a little like like the graphics could look better.
2386920	2390920	And I was like, you know what, I want to go back and see what Diablo three looks like.
2391640	2397160	And boy, boy, did I fall down a rabbit hole playing Diablo three season. What the fuck season
2397160	2405400	are we on 26 of Diablo three, and I'm leveling a crusader. Yeah, I've spent hours playing that. So
2405400	2411720	it's funny. Tiger Claw in chat says it's normal for a person to build a high end PC to play old
2411720	2416760	games from years ago, because those old games are going to run buttery smooth on like the old PC.
2416760	2420360	It's like an old game you used to play that ran like crap on an old PC,
2420360	2426440	and then you revisit it and see that it runs better. Yes, yes, that is it. Because I have
2426440	2431480	dropped a lot of hours on Diablo three in the past. So going back to revisit it now where it's
2431480	2437960	like, I can play in 4k, like 60 plus frames a second. I don't know if it's capped or what,
2437960	2444280	but just it it's like, the game isn't ever going to look better than this. And I'm like,
2444280	2449080	this is nice, especially because that game is also I think hitting its 10 year anniversary,
2449080	2452440	even though we don't count the first two years, that game is still hitting its anniversary.
2452440	2457000	And it's like, that's a pretty old game too. But sorry, not sorry. Like it's just,
2457000	2462280	it's fun to go back and revisit an old friend and be like, you got some work done. You've
2462280	2466840	got your fillers and your face left. You're looking wonderful. And your wigs, you're looking
2466840	2474280	wonderful. So, so that was my gaming week, Diablo three with wigs. It was great.
2476760	2482600	All right. Yeah, TigerClawnChat. What's that? Girl who did that nose.
2485000	2488920	TigerClawnChat says it's one of the joys of having a faster computer. Absolutely.
2489560	2494520	Questbuster in chat says, lol, I've seen a lot of people say, man, I hate what they've done with
2494520	2500520	Diablo immortal, but now I can get into Diablo three instead. It's very that like playing Diablo
2500520	2506360	immortal made me realize I'm really excited for Diablo four and I should just go play Diablo three.
2507480	2514040	So for better or for worse, I guess Blizzard got that on me. So there you go. All right,
2514040	2518760	let's get into some other gaming news going on throughout the industry. We'll start with
2518760	2525560	Loki on another Microsoft owned. I mean, I guess Blizzard is soon to be Microsoft owned,
2525560	2527720	but let's talk about one they already own. Right, Loki?
2528280	2534040	Yeah. So apparently there is a report that was put out by Kotaku earlier this month
2535240	2542200	that was talking about crunch. I mean, everybody's been talking about crunch at different studios,
2542760	2549880	claiming that ZeniMax was crunching that will basically having their employees crunched during
2549880	2555400	the development of Fallout 76 and Skyrim and talking about like, you know, that,
2556920	2561560	you know, this is not a really healthy environment for their employees. So of course,
2563080	2571320	the ZeniMax or Matt Booty, the head of Xbox games studio said that report was unfair to
2571400	2576040	tribute. Well, first off, it's playing the blame game. So he's saying it's unfair because
2576680	2581880	you're tripping the crunch culture only to Bethesda, which I don't think is true. I mean,
2581880	2588680	if you just had eyes, he would know that there's been dozens of articles that have come out about
2588680	2593640	different companies crunching for different games. Yes. So it's not exclusively Bethesda
2593640	2600600	and also saying, well, it's not fair because they're looking back too far. Right. That was
2600600	2608440	back in 2018 and during Skyrim's development and stuff. But he didn't comment about what's going
2608440	2618120	on now. I'll give him this crumb. It was before Microsoft owned them. So I can see why he is
2618120	2623080	saying it's unfair to ask him or, you know, put it on Microsoft, you know, all this stuff that
2623080	2628600	happened before they were in the picture. And to piggyback on this comment, Phoenix7726 in chat
2628600	2633000	says, I wish Activision was not keeping Kotick on, but, you know, abuse is okay and all. So
2633000	2637320	fuck Activision. I don't disagree with you. And I still have a lot of problems with what's going on
2637320	2642600	to Activision, but I also kind of feel like with the Microsoft purchase, you sort of see the light
2642600	2649880	at the end of the tunnel. Not that Microsoft is a company free of problems. However, you do see
2649880	2657080	things like they are acknowledging unions. They are working, you know, with these concerns and
2657080	2661800	things to try to be at the cutting edge of that. The way Microsoft has been one of the first to
2661800	2666920	step up and make their games more accessible and work with accessibility controllers and things of
2666920	2672040	that sort. The way that, you know, Microsoft has also kind of really tried to eliminate crunch
2672040	2677080	time where they can and so forth. Again, I'm not trying to like say, oh, Microsoft is untouchable
2677080	2683160	and they're a company free of wrongdoing. They're not, but I feel like at least Phil Spencer
2683160	2691320	specifically and a lot of the Xbox team as a result is the culture that is trying to listen
2691320	2698040	and do better. And that is important. And I, of course, I want to see Bobby Kotick gone.
2699160	2703880	I'm still trying to hold a shred of hope that that might happen. And that there's a lot of facade
2703880	2710920	that has to happen until this deal is finalized. Once this deal is finalized, if Kotick is still
2710920	2716280	there, you'll probably hear me bitching a lot more until he's gone. I'm trying to hold out a
2716280	2722600	shred of hope that there's just kind of a hush, hush, shh, let him think what he wants, you know,
2722600	2728680	until Microsoft actually, the deal is signed and everything's done. But I'm really trying to hope
2728680	2733160	and hold out faith that Bobby Kotick's days are numbered as is that board because they're rendered
2733160	2737880	irrelevant once Microsoft owns them. So anyway, sorry, not to deviate too much. I know this is
2737960	2742440	a Bethesda story, but I kind of wanted to say like what my current thoughts are on all that.
2742440	2748120	And certainly, yeah, certainly I would say, you know, it might be good for them to like reassure
2748120	2751800	like, hey, listen, you know, that may have been what their culture was in the past, but here
2751800	2756360	Microsoft are going to try to make sure that that doesn't happen. That was a better answer. Yeah.
2756360	2761400	He just mentions that they have anonymous ways to report that to HR or something like that.
2761400	2766440	But, you know, typically even, you know, we've heard stories like even so much as Activision,
2766440	2770920	you know, that reporting the HR doesn't do anything. HR protects corporations,
2770920	2776600	they don't protect people. So it's, I don't know if that's necessarily like a really good
2776600	2783480	approach. It's not really reassuring. But like, yeah, they haven't chose to publicly comment on
2783480	2791000	what the work conditions are. So, you know, we better not find out in two years time that,
2791000	2795720	oh, hey, they were crunching whoop. Yeah, that would be ugly.
2795720	2799240	Because that'll look pretty bad. But you know why I don't think they are? Because they delayed
2799240	2805000	Starfield. And I think that's probably a sign that things have changed because I don't think
2805000	2812440	old Bethesda would have delayed Starfield. So I think I think that is, I think that's a good sign.
2812440	2817320	Again, I would be mad to if I heard this, but I think that's a good sign. That's, it's turning
2817320	2824840	out for the better. So, all right. Well, moving on, let's talk about kind of a surprise, not
2824840	2832280	surprise announcement of a game release on a new console. And that is Phantasy Star Online 2 New
2832280	2837640	Genesis. It's finally coming out for PlayStation 4. I thought that this was pretty much exclusive
2837640	2843800	to Microsoft and PC forever, but I guess it must have been a limited timeframe. So PlayStation 4
2843800	2848520	will get its release of Phantasy Star Online, or excuse me, Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis
2848520	2855880	on August 31st, 2022. The Japanese version of course was released on PS4 a long time ago.
2855880	2861240	It's also on the Nintendo Switch and nothing has been said about the Nintendo Switch version here.
2861240	2866760	Keep in mind the Switch version is a cloud run thing. So that could also be just some of the
2866760	2872920	challenges there is who would host that and pay for it to have that game come out here. But the
2872920	2877240	fact that it's coming out on PlayStation 4 over here is still a pretty big deal. It will be caught
2877240	2883560	up with the Xbox version. The new Kavaris region will be there. The Waker class that was revealed
2883560	2889640	recently, that will all be there and cross-play with Xbox and PC. So it's kind of nice to see
2889640	2895400	that as well. So of course the game will be free to play as well. So yeah, a lot of people excited
2895400	2901160	about that. I guess that news also coming out of Anime Expo because there's an art exhibition going
2901160	2908520	on there where there's like concept art and things like that. So cool that Phantasy Star Online 2
2908520	2914120	is going to be exposed to a new audience. You know, I loved the original and I tried to get
2914120	2917320	into the sequel and I tried to get into New Genesis a little bit too. And maybe it's one of
2917320	2925720	those games I need to revisit at some point. But I was almost, they sat on it so long before
2925720	2932040	releasing it here in the US that my issue ended up being I was so overwhelmed when I started
2932040	2937640	Phantasy Star Online 2, I didn't know where to begin. And like, I wasn't sure if I was playing
2937640	2945720	the game right. Because it was just so much to do that I was like, is this the right thing to be
2945720	2953080	doing? I know it's a weird approach, but like it's, you know that gif of Sabrina the teenage
2953080	2958200	witch where like all these plates of pancakes are suddenly coming into frame. And she's like,
2958200	2962760	huh? Like she has nowhere to begin. That's like me playing Phantasy Star Online 2. That's how I
2962760	2970680	felt. So it's too many pancakes. So, but I, you know, now that I have a PC that runs better,
2970680	2974120	that really is one of those games I should go back and revisit and see if I can kind of get
2974120	2978360	into it the second time around. We'll see. All right, moving on, Dar Sakura.
2978360	2986440	So, you know, the internet can be a very toxic place. We all know this. I mean,
2986440	2992680	were we not just talking about like, you know, last week about some of the negativity that
2992680	2994680	we've seen in our early days? Sure.
2995960	3005160	Well, the Return to Monkey Island director Ron Gilbert has decided to no longer talk about the
3005160	3013160	game online due to abuse, particularly about the art style. Video Games Chronicle actually did
3013160	3020520	make a report on it that he said on his personal blog that has now actually been completely shut
3020520	3030200	down. I will quote, the joy of sharing has been driven from me. And it's just, it's very sad to
3030200	3034200	see this. And in fact, I'll go ahead and read the rest of the quote. I'm shutting down comments.
3034200	3038920	People are being mean and I'm having to delete personal attack comments. It's an amazing game
3038920	3043000	and everyone on the team is very proud of it. Play it or don't play it, but don't ruin it for
3043000	3047880	everyone else. I won't be posting any more about the game. The joy of sharing has been driven from
3047880	3059080	me. And yeah, like there are other people who have come to his defense and the team's defense,
3059640	3066360	basically shaming all of the people who came out and said such horrible, terrible things.
3068200	3075800	He's also on record, I'll give another quote. Return to Monkey Island may not be the art style
3075800	3081880	you wanted or were expecting, but it's the art style I wanted. He said the point of the games
3081880	3087720	was always to use state of the art text and art to push the franchise forward.
3088600	3095640	And even if he had been the one to make Monkey Island 3, he wouldn't have made it look like the
3095640	3104360	prior games either. But it is coming to PC and Switch later on this year, possibly other consoles.
3106920	3114680	And it's on the game's website saying that this will be the exciting conclusion
3115240	3123000	to the Monkey Island series. Now, to everyone who was a shit about it, fuck you.
3123000	3124520	Those people aren't listening to this show.
3125720	3129080	Rob, I know, but I can say whatever the fuck I want.
3129080	3133640	Of course you can. But those people turn this show off in the first five minutes
3133640	3134600	when we were talking about COVID.
3134600	3140360	I don't care if they're listening or not. They're the garbage of the internet.
3140360	3141880	I don't care what they think.
3141880	3142380	Yeah.
3143180	3151100	But that's just what I would say if they were listening, is fuck you.
3152460	3155420	And I'm sorry no one ever hugged you when you were a child.
3156620	3160700	You know, I'm sorry you had to live in an attic where no one ever loved you.
3161900	3164860	But maybe it's about time to learn some compassion
3165500	3169580	and learn that if you can't say something nice, don't fucking say it at all.
3170220	3172700	And the art style looks fine to me.
3176300	3177740	It's OK. I get it.
3177740	3185260	Like, I get the like for me, it's like I love the original two Monkey Island games.
3185900	3191580	I didn't necessarily like the Telltale Monkey Island games because the art style was different
3191580	3193980	and the story was a little bit different as well.
3193980	3197180	And I understand people are probably, you know, thinking when they heard,
3197180	3201580	oh, a new Monkey Island game that it would be done similar to like Thimbleweed Park,
3201580	3207820	where it's in a very similar style to the original like Maniac Mansion,
3207820	3209100	Monkey Island type games.
3209100	3212380	But yeah, that may be what you think it should be.
3212380	3214700	But like when you're talking about the creator of the game
3214700	3216540	and this is the art style that they want to go with,
3216540	3219420	well, maybe just give it a chance or something, you know,
3219420	3222540	and let the writing speak for it and stuff because, you know,
3222540	3227340	I know that there is an article that it doesn't appear that we're talking about,
3227340	3234860	where Miyamoto did not like the appearance of cel shaded link of, you know, to link, if you will.
3234860	3238140	That's because they're bringing up Wind Waker in our chat room right now.
3238140	3244460	And talking about how these these kids today don't remember that there was controversy with that.
3244460	3245900	Well, and that's the thing with Wind Waker.
3245900	3251740	Like, it's funny, like after playing Wind Waker, it's like, I really like that art style.
3251740	3254620	Like I thought when I first saw it, I'm like, Oh God, that looks terrible.
3254620	3257420	But then you actually play the game and the world and everything.
3257420	3259980	And that art style really fits with that.
3259980	3265340	And so it's just, I don't know, I think people just need to give it up.
3268540	3272300	People are quick to react and and slow to accept.
3273100	3279660	And there is like this weird sort of duality to the internet where they have both
3279660	3282220	very short memories and very long memories.
3282780	3286380	And they're in their selective memories, you know.
3286380	3288300	They don't have long memories. They have a search bar.
3289900	3293980	No, some people do. Oh, I remember something that happened on the internet here.
3293980	3299260	Let me go look through the Wayback Machine and see if I can find it and find the receipts on it.
3299900	3307180	You know, but at any rate, I think that people just need to shut up.
3307180	3313820	I mean, there are things that do deserve to be called out, as we will be discussing later.
3314940	3322780	But when someone is so excited and are just doing nothing but positive things and talking about,
3323420	3328060	you know, this this game that they're putting their heart and their passion into.
3329260	3334460	When I mean, there's such a thing as being critical.
3335340	3337820	You know, like a true constructive critique.
3339180	3341420	And then there's such a thing as just being mean.
3342380	3345580	And even the mildest of those were mean.
3348300	3354460	So, you know, what what what they were doing were personal attacks.
3355660	3363020	The an art direction that someone has integrated into their world view of this
3363020	3364540	art that they're creating.
3366300	3370860	Basically, you're attacking a fundamental piece of themselves,
3370860	3374140	because everyone puts a little bit of themselves into their art that they make.
3375340	3379660	Imagine, imagine screaming at Vincent van Gogh because you didn't like the way the painting turned out.
3380700	3383660	Well, a lot of people did scream at Van Gogh, and then he killed himself.
3385100	3388140	I guess that is true. Some some things never change.
3388620	3389820	Some some things never change.
3390700	3394220	I'm going to chat for some comments over twitch.tv slash vog network.
3394220	3397820	S2100 Matt says a lot of the milder nasty comments were like,
3397820	3400700	wow, this art style looks like garbage budget cuts much.
3400700	3402860	You can't afford more than flash style art.
3402860	3405580	Some folks were attacking them for deleting comments saying it's so
3405580	3407660	important that you're deleting fans comments.
3407660	3409260	Way not to listen to the community.
3409260	3412300	If you can't listen to criticism, then how can you be in the game industry?
3412300	3413980	Maybe hire a PR person.
3413980	3417580	They're saying this to Rob Gilbert, who is a legend in the industry.
3418460	3421420	And then S2100 Matt also makes the brings up the Wind Waker.
3421420	3423100	Everyone can do what the fuck he wants with it.
3423100	3423740	That's right.
3423740	3425820	Rob Gilbert can do whatever the fuck he wants.
3425820	3426940	Play his game or don't.
3427740	3431260	But your comment on the Internet does nothing.
3432700	3436460	I guess I hope if Ron Gilbert can take anything from this,
3437180	3440620	I hope he knows that at the end of the day, those comments mean nothing.
3441180	3442540	Those people mean nothing.
3442780	3449580	But I at the same time, I really can't fault him for looking at his mentions
3449900	3451500	and just seeing a cesspool.
3451500	3454220	You know, of course, people are morbidly curious.
3454220	3457820	How do you think sometimes we found the ugly comments about our show?
3457820	3459260	Cause you're morbidly curious.
3459260	3462780	You search for, Oh God, why, why did I look that up?
3462780	3463660	I didn't need to see that.
3465100	3467820	Is excited about something that they're creating.
3467820	3470780	They do want to see what other people to show.
3471580	3473660	What other people to share in with their excitement,
3473660	3475100	and they'll probably check for it.
3475740	3479820	And, you know, he made the mistake of reading the comment section.
3480940	3485740	But again, you know, like when I put out my artwork,
3485740	3487660	I want to see what people think about it.
3487660	3492220	If I get like a good critique, you know, I've got a couple of friends
3492220	3495980	who thankfully are also artists and can give me like true critiques
3495980	3499260	and point out, you know, things here and there that I could have done better.
3499260	3501660	And that's what I like, like to see just like,
3501660	3507420	Oh, Hey, that shoulder is just a little bit bigger than what anatomy would say.
3507420	3508460	And I'll be like, Oh, okay.
3509100	3514940	You know, that's the kind of thing that I look for when, when I'm putting artwork.
3515660	3522220	But I also think that there is a difference between being constructive
3523100	3525980	and then being just destructive.
3525980	3532220	And I would delete the destructive comments on my own personal stuff to to.
3533500	3539260	I guess remove some of the sources of stress and and and maybe some triggering items.
3540060	3544140	I have I see nothing wrong with what he did, and I understand
3544940	3547500	why he's stepping away from sharing that.
3548060	3553260	And I would like to say right now that if anyone listening to this episode live or
3553580	3561900	in podcast form were among the people who said such mean, destructive things,
3562540	3567820	I would like for you to take a step back and look really hard at what kind of person you are.
3569820	3575900	Just stop and look and ask yourself, is this the kind of person you want to be seen as?
3577100	3582300	And if you do want to be seen as a toxic piece of shit online,
3582460	3583580	then I'd rather not know you.
3583580	3584080	Yeah.
3584940	3588700	And to be very clear, there is a very clear difference between constructive
3588700	3592460	criticism because you just heard Loki say, I'm not the biggest fan of this,
3592460	3595500	but I get you know, and now with it, but he says, but I at the end, it's his
3595500	3596540	choice of what he wants to do.
3596540	3599980	That is completely different from what Dark Soccer is talking about.
3599980	3602220	Yeah, that's a simple statement of opinion.
3602220	3602720	Yes.
3603580	3609020	And some people would argue that saying that something looking like garbage is opinion as well.
3609020	3614700	But at the same time, and I even talked about this before, intent versus impact.
3617740	3628300	If you want to be constructive or say your opinion and still be tactful about it,
3629020	3633500	you can say something to the effect of, oh, it's not to my tastes.
3633500	3635420	We'll see what happens when it comes out.
3635420	3635920	There you go.
3635920	3637840	We'll see what happens when it comes out.
3637840	3638880	There you go.
3638880	3642880	How many times do I say I'm going to reserve judgment for when the thing is out?
3644480	3647520	So, I mean, that's, or just don't say anything.
3647520	3650720	Say it on your own freaking blog or whatever.
3650720	3652080	Put it on your own Twitter.
3653920	3658560	Yeah, I was just, you'll find you save a lot of time by just not saying anything at all.
3659200	3659700	Yeah.
3661280	3667360	But some people also want to get in a little bit on, I hate to say it this way,
3667360	3672480	but the witch hunt mentality where they're like, oh, I'm going to say something too
3672480	3677520	and be like all these other people, or I'm going to get in on the hate because of FOMO.
3678560	3685200	Or I've got the best zinger and I want to get clicks by saying this really shitty thing
3685200	3686800	because it's the best zinger.
3687280	3694400	And then the rest of us, we need to stop supporting it with our silence.
3695120	3698560	And for the love of God, stop quote tweeting to dunk on it.
3698560	3701440	And I've been guilty of this and I'm trying to do better.
3701440	3704080	Stop quote tweeting to dunk on people.
3704080	3709040	Screenshot it if you must, and then dunk on it because when you quote tweet it,
3709040	3710480	you're still giving them engagement.
3710480	3716000	I mean, I will reply to things, but at this point I'm, you know,
3716000	3722960	now I'm down to the line of blanket statements just because I can't.
3722960	3725440	I don't want to support that kind of behavior.
3726080	3732160	And I think that if more people are willing to stand up and call this bullshit out,
3732160	3737520	and I'm not saying just with this cruelty toxic environment on the internet,
3737520	3748480	but I'm also saying in real life, if you see somebody of, you know, a disenfranchised group
3749360	3754640	being attacked for something that they can't do really anything about,
3754640	3756800	you stand up and you fucking say something.
3757680	3758960	You call people out.
3759840	3761920	You never know who's going to stand with you.
3761920	3768320	Just be willing to be a better person because silence is complicity.
3768960	3769920	And that's what I'll say about it.
3769920	3772960	A lot of people do things for like that, like the zingers I mentioned,
3772960	3774640	a lot of people do that for attention.
3774640	3778160	And if you make it very clear, they're not getting attention, they're getting negativity,
3778960	3780400	you owe it to do that.
3781280	3786560	Yeah, SJ100matt in chat says, there's also something to say for some people
3786560	3789120	that feel they can bully their way into harassing the creator,
3789120	3791120	forgetting what they want, how they want it.
3791120	3793120	Yeah, I mean, mass effect.
3793120	3795120	Yeah, again, you're not the artist.
3795760	3797440	Anyway, knock it the fuck off.
3798000	3799440	All right, let's move on to our next story.
3799440	3799940	Loki.
3801280	3801780	Yes.
3802640	3807600	So we've talked a lot about different Niantic games that are coming out.
3809040	3811040	But now we have the opposite.
3811040	3814160	We have a lot of different games that are coming out.
3814720	3816720	But now we have the opposite.
3816720	3824480	So Niantic has actually cut projects, and they've also let go more than 80 staff.
3825760	3829120	Apparently part of the projects that have been canceled,
3829760	3832880	the new Transformers game that they're supposed to be putting out.
3833920	3835440	That's a bummer because they were testing that.
3836400	3839440	Yeah, which I guess was codenamed Heavy Metal,
3839440	3841680	or I don't know if that was the official game for it.
3841680	3843760	There's a canceled game called Hamlet,
3844400	3848320	which was, I guess, some collaboration between them and Punch Drunk.
3849280	3851760	Blue Sky and Snowball.
3851760	3857120	But I'm not sure if those are codenames or actual game titles.
3859040	3862240	But yeah, they said they've recently decided to stop production on some projects
3862240	3866880	and reduce their workforce by 8% to focus on key priorities.
3866960	3871760	There was the article that started getting copy pasted from the original Bloomberg
3871760	3876480	report was interesting because the Bloomberg report kind of lumped in Catan and it said
3876480	3880160	Catan and Pikmin Bloom were recent financial disappointments.
3880800	3883120	Those games are very different because...
3883120	3884960	I didn't think, well, Catan never came out.
3884960	3888960	Catan never came out outside Australia, New Zealand and the other test regions.
3888960	3891360	So it did come out there for about a year.
3891360	3894240	And like a lot of us were waiting on it, like, what's the hold up with Catan?
3894240	3895120	And then they canceled.
3895280	3896320	So that's very different.
3896320	3900400	Pikmin Bloom is out and running and they're doing community days.
3900400	3904560	And as far as we know, the game is well enough to keep it running.
3904560	3912800	So I sort of would like to know what is the source on Pikmin Bloom not meeting expectations,
3912800	3914400	because I'm not sure there is one.
3914400	3917120	And that got copy pasted into, oh, it's failing.
3917120	3920960	Now, again, I'm only going to defend Niantic so far.
3920960	3923360	I do really love a lot of their products.
3923360	3929760	But the recent changes they've made to Pikmin Bloom are terrible and reek of desperation.
3929760	3933760	And that is that they halved the effectiveness of planting petals in the game.
3933760	3936800	I'm not going to really get into the weeds for those that, you know, because it doesn't
3936800	3941840	make any sense if you haven't played the game, but just basically they're trying to coax
3941840	3946960	more people into spending money in the shop, which like, there really isn't a reason to
3946960	3947360	do it.
3947360	3951440	And I feel like they're finally starting to see like, oh, this is going to be a really
3951680	3955120	they're finally starting to see like, oh, maybe we could do cosmetics and some other
3955120	3955680	things.
3955680	3957040	And that might work out a little better.
3957040	3959840	But I feel like they're kind of meeting that a little too late.
3959840	3962640	And it's a lot of what a lot of people are saying about Pokemon Go as well.
3963360	3968960	But anyway, my point really is, I still don't know if that necessarily means that Pikmin
3968960	3970480	Bloom is a failure.
3971200	3976960	And I'd like to know where Bloomberg is getting that data.
3977920	3980160	So that's just all.
3980240	3984160	I don't know if it's because, oh, it's not making the Pokemon Go money.
3984160	3987360	It's it's down in the top 100 grossing games.
3988640	3990640	So here's where he's getting that from.
3990640	3997600	He's giving it from and it was an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg, where the Niantic
3998320	4005600	chief executive, John Hank, was saying that they are facing a time of economic turmoil
4005600	4008080	and they're reducing costs in a variety of areas.
4008720	4014560	Yeah, but they that that report called out the Pikmin and Catan, not Hanky.
4015120	4018800	So he wouldn't a CEO is not going to call out specific projects like that.
4018800	4020240	That would be very demoralizing.
4020240	4027120	Probably just taking guesses, I guess, based off of their popular, which I get it.
4027120	4029040	It's not making Pokemon Go money.
4029600	4034960	It's and in fact, I think the coin system and everything in that game has been busted
4034960	4035760	since the beginning.
4036000	4040000	I can see why Pikmin Bloom is probably not meeting expectation.
4040000	4042800	It probably isn't, but I'm not sure they have the data to back that up.
4042800	4044880	And nothing is going to make Pokemon Go money.
4044880	4045380	Nothing.
4046720	4047760	Except Pokemon Go.
4049520	4056320	Now, again, remember everything I said at the top of the show, Pikmin was very incentivizing
4056320	4057840	for me to get to where I am now.
4057840	4063200	So, yeah, I'm going to defend that game a little bit, but there again, it also has its
4063200	4064320	flaws, that's for sure.
4066240	4067680	I did think it was also interesting.
4067680	4073200	All of this news came the day after that announcement that Niantic's making an NBA game.
4077120	4079440	Well, I mean, it is a little.
4079440	4080480	Well, when they first.
4080480	4086800	Okay, keep in mind, I played Ingress first since 2014 and Pokemon Go came out, what,
4086800	4088000	2016?
4088000	4090560	So actually, God, I was probably playing Ingress even before that.
4090560	4096400	But anyway, when it was first announced that the makers of Ingress were going to make Pokemon
4096400	4099920	Go, my reaction was, that's fucking weird.
4099920	4101120	And it turned out all right.
4101920	4104480	So I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt.
4104480	4109520	And I understand that if they want to make Pokemon Go money, they've got to find the
4109520	4113440	franchise that has the fan base that's going to do that.
4113440	4117200	And major sports is a pretty good place to start.
4117200	4121440	And the biggest win for Niantic there, it's going to be a different audience, because
4121440	4126560	I would bet the people that are really into the NBA probably do not have a huge overlap
4126560	4127520	with Pokemon Go.
4127520	4130000	Of course, there's some before you speak up in chat.
4130000	4130640	I like both.
4130640	4132000	Of course, there's some.
4132000	4133920	But it is going to draw in a different crowd.
4134640	4136480	I'm just curious, what is the game?
4137280	4138640	You know what the crowd is?
4138640	4144960	It's the crowd of those people that play sports games that dump tons of money into those ultimate
4144960	4145520	team.
4145520	4150320	And I don't know what the equivalent is in NBA 2K sports.
4150320	4152400	Sports fans will just dump money in that stuff.
4152400	4153680	It's a proven.
4153680	4154400	You're not wrong.
4155120	4161920	It's a proven thing with like EA is what makes that's their bread and butter and jam and
4161920	4162800	peanut butter.
4162800	4166880	E3VL says, Do you have to jump in place and pretend shot unknown?
4166880	4170720	There's still a lot to kind of figure out because we've seen like three screenshots.
4170720	4174560	It's kind of hard to tell what's going on, but you can guess it will involve going to
4174560	4177520	real world locations, including basketball courts.
4177520	4182720	Now I know why they've been having us categorize in Niantic Wayfarer what a way stop is.
4182720	4186800	They know exactly where all the sports courts are because they've been building that database
4186800	4189360	up for a few years and then doing something.
4189360	4191520	But it looks like I don't think you're actually playing basketball.
4191520	4193840	You're doing some type of team management sort of thing.
4193840	4201280	They could just they could take the Pokemon, go Pokeball throwing is use that as a basketball
4201280	4202320	throwing into a hoop.
4202320	4206800	Yeah, Quest Buster in chat says it feels like they're trying to Netflix their way to another
4206800	4207600	Pokemon go.
4207600	4210240	Their Harry Potter game sounded like it could have printed money for him.
4210240	4211360	Then it shut down.
4211360	4215200	One thing I want to remind people about that Harry Potter game, because again, none of
4215200	4216880	the press seems to remember this.
4217600	4222480	The Harry Potter game was a port key game who makes all those Harry Potter games.
4222480	4226560	It's WB Warner Brothers games like little Harry Potter specific division.
4227120	4234240	That was their game in partnership with Niantic, who I'm sure gave them an early version of
4234240	4239360	the light ship technology with all the, you know, where everything is in order to make
4239360	4240080	that.
4240080	4244000	So that was a little bit different of a failing.
4245040	4251520	And you and I and everybody else in this room know JK Rowling's unfortunate fucking mouth
4252400	4255680	had a lot to do with the failure of that game as well, because I'll tell you, that completely
4255680	4256800	killed my desire to play it.
4256800	4258000	And I know I'm not the only one.
4259040	4263200	So but that was a port key games failing in that.
4264240	4266400	Well, I shouldn't even necessarily say it was there.
4266400	4269040	If it was anyone's failing, it was JK Rowling.
4269040	4274000	She failed, but port key just didn't have the game that made money.
4274000	4278080	And I think the reason why is because it wasn't Niantic.
4278080	4279360	It was somebody else.
4280400	4285600	They tried to make a game that was very similar to Pokemon go when it didn't really fit the
4285600	4286240	franchise.
4286880	4291200	Where that game was best was when it did something different.
4291200	4295360	When you did the gym battles and you were actually, like, battling with other people
4295360	4299600	and you were drawing the wand patterns to do different spells and you actually had,
4299600	4305440	like, the DPS tank healer trifecta and all that that you didn't see in Pokemon go, that
4305440	4309040	was where that game was its strongest was when it was trying not to be Pokemon go.
4310000	4312880	So I think there were just a few decisions in that game.
4312880	4320560	So Godatz in chat says, maybe I'm a bit of a dingus for thinking it, but wouldn't Niantic
4320560	4323360	do well to partner with similar games to Pokemon?
4323360	4326240	I wonder if titles like Digimon would get general interest.
4327360	4330320	Well, some would argue more fun.
4331440	4334160	Some would argue Pikmin is kind of that.
4334720	4337360	It's Nintendo cute monster property.
4338240	4343840	But I think at the end of the day, though, they don't want to split the player base.
4343840	4347360	They don't really win by splitting their player base too much.
4347360	4352800	That's why I think NBA I keep saying NBA Jam, which sadly, it's going to be nothing like
4352800	4352960	that.
4352960	4353600	I wish it was.
4354320	4360240	But the NBA game, that's why it's that because it's a very different fandom, I think.
4361120	4362480	So it'll be interesting to see.
4362480	4364880	And Mike Deff says Digimon already has its own AR game.
4365040	4368720	Maybe it was already somebody else picked that up.
4368720	4374960	So anyway, it'll be interesting to see because Niantic, don't forget, they still are scheduled
4374960	4376160	to release Pareto.
4376160	4380560	As far as we know, that game was not canceled, but that game also hasn't been released.
4381120	4382320	I should also say somewhere.
4382320	4383120	This is very interesting.
4383120	4385200	So Niantic Campfire sort of came out.
4386400	4389280	Niantic Campfire has been built into Ingress for some time.
4389280	4390560	This is their social network.
4391120	4395200	And I got into Niantic Campfire for a few days.
4395200	4399440	I can't get in now unless I get in through Ingress, which is weird.
4400080	4404160	But if you are able to get into Niantic Campfire through the app, which apparently they have
4404160	4408080	figured out that people who have tickets to Seattle Go Fest are the ones that can get
4408080	4408240	in.
4409680	4413680	They actually now have what fans have been asking for for a long time.
4413680	4419840	And that is a map that you can scroll around on your phone and see all of the gyms and
4419840	4422400	what raid is going on in that gym right now.
4422400	4426080	You can't see what color it is or who's defending it, but you can see where all of
4426080	4430560	the raids are anywhere in the world, which I thought was interesting.
4431440	4436400	So I'm very curious to see what the future of Campfire is, because many people are calling
4436400	4441680	it a knockoff of Discord, which, yes, all of the features we've seen so far are a knockoff
4441680	4442640	of Discord.
4442640	4445760	However, that Pokemon Go map that came out of nowhere.
4445760	4447600	That was something we hadn't seen yet.
4447600	4449680	I'm curious what else we haven't seen.
4449760	4450640	So we'll see.
4451840	4453280	Anyway, let's move on.
4454880	4459920	I'd like to talk about some updates for Twitch.television, the very platform we are
4459920	4461120	broadcasting on right now.
4461840	4463520	A couple of new things that have been teased.
4463520	4464960	The new channel switcher.
4464960	4466080	I've seen this.
4466080	4468000	So this is when you're browsing on Twitch.
4468000	4473760	You now see like random channels on a carousel at the bottom of the screen, and you actually
4473760	4479360	get a one minute preview of the channel without having to watch an ad before going into the
4479440	4485760	channel, because many people will flip out or tune out because an ad comes on right away
4485760	4489600	when they load up the stream, even though the broadcaster may not be trying to have
4489600	4490160	that happen.
4490880	4497120	That's why when we're broadcasting live on Twitch, I do forced ads at the beginning
4497120	4502400	when the cats, the little, stay tuned, we're coming up soon, when the cats are on before
4502400	4508160	we go live, because that will buy us 30 minutes where that doesn't happen, and people can
4508240	4510480	just jump right into OLR without watching an ad.
4511760	4515600	So the nice thing about the carousel is that you don't have to watch an ad to test a
4515600	4516160	channel.
4516160	4521360	So that's pretty cool, because I do test a lot of channels, especially when drop campaigns
4521360	4522240	are going on.
4522240	4526800	So like when drop campaigns are happening with No Man's Sky, I had to test a lot of
4526800	4531360	channels, and some streamers for No Man's Sky, pretty good.
4531360	4535920	Some streamers for No Man's Sky, harder to watch.
4536480	4541360	So the carousel switcher kind of gives me an opportunity to test the stream without
4541360	4543840	having to sit through a minute of ads before that.
4543840	4544480	So that's nice.
4545280	4551680	The other thing that's coming that's interesting is the guest star feature.
4552880	4557600	Guest star allows guests to join a host in a stream.
4557600	4562480	Apparently it is similar to like Clubhouse or I think Mixer had this functionality before
4562480	4563360	it went away.
4563440	4567280	Remember good old Beam, Mixer, and then went out to pasture?
4568640	4574320	You actually can include other streamers and viewers in the broadcast with video and audio,
4574320	4575840	so you kind of bring people in and out.
4575840	4578960	So that's interesting that that feature, I haven't seen a lot of that feature in use
4578960	4583040	because only a very small audience has it right now, but I'm very curious to see what
4583040	4591200	that brings in because if we are able to get listeners, that is going to be a new way for
4591200	4593440	us to take calls on this show.
4593440	4597200	And yes, I'm very open to that idea, so we'll see.
4597200	4601840	Except the only problem is because of the fact that Dark Soccer and Loki and I are all
4601840	4607120	on Discord, but then the question is, can we do the whole show with Dark Soccer and
4607120	4609840	Loki being on their own streams and coming in here?
4609840	4610320	I don't know.
4612080	4616800	This could change the formula, and I'm not saying we aren't going to do this or that.
4616800	4619360	We're going to do what works for the show.
4620240	4623200	But it's an exciting new idea, that's for sure.
4623200	4627440	So I'm curious to see what comes of this feature.
4627440	4632720	And I think, like Dark Soccer, I know right now this is only available on just chatting
4632720	4637360	streams, but how transformative is this going to be for the Dead by Daylight streaming
4637360	4641360	community if all of the streamers can now co-stream each other's games?
4642160	4648800	Yeah, instead of having to use the third-party multi-stream thing.
4648880	4657600	Yeah, which is honestly a pain in the ass for someone to watch, especially if you get
4657600	4659360	easily overwhelmed by stuff.
4659360	4663920	Yeah, which, you know, again, Mixer did it, which we could say, you know, a couple of
4663920	4668720	years ago, but it's nice to see Twitch, oh yeah, that was a thing that was kind of neat
4668720	4677120	about Mixer that will be very exciting when that launches here is if that comes to pass
4677120	4678960	and we can do like Dead by Daylight and stuff.
4679920	4683520	Mike Defton chat says, Rob, you're probably the first person I've heard say something
4683520	4685280	dot TV as television.
4685280	4686400	You're getting old.
4686400	4689280	It's actually an in-joke from some streamers I watch.
4689280	4694080	You know, it's just like the whole like when you want to sound old and clueless, you
4694080	4699120	talk about sound drops on my Twitch television.
4699120	4705120	You know, this is what you, you know, it's just a way of speaking or it's like how
4705120	4707920	everybody calls Dead by Daylight something different.
4707920	4712000	Deborah Delight or, you know, like, yeah, Debbie Delight,
4715200	4719200	Deadbeat Deadass or something, you know, like everybody just calls us something different.
4719200	4722000	So, yeah, that always happens.
4723040	4726160	Anyways, so I'll be curious to see what happens with that.
4726720	4727520	Let's move on.
4727520	4728240	Dark Sakura.
4728800	4733200	So, EEA did a boo-boo.
4734160	4745520	They, they, they, so they made a tweet, a very bad joke, especially given their history.
4748400	4754720	They're basically, you know, taking, taking the piss on single player games.
4755680	4764960	And so it posted, EEA posted at 733 the other day that they, they're a 10, but they only
4764960	4766880	like playing single player games.
4768880	4774400	It was playing off a meme that was showing up on, on TikTok, like, that's already kind
4774400	4774880	of dead.
4775520	4786560	And one of the Forbes writer, Paul Tassi, this was great.
4787120	4788800	This is a great clapback.
4788800	4789680	Understandable.
4789680	4792240	You are unfamiliar with the concept of 10s.
4792240	4793440	He made Anthem.
4793440	4794560	Just saying a fact here.
4796160	4800480	Well, that actually, that last one came from a Washington Post from Gene Park on Washington
4800480	4800980	Post.
4802080	4804320	You know, that, that is, that's a read.
4805360	4805920	That's a read.
4808560	4821440	And then the, the head of, of Respawn, Vince Ambella, basically just replied with a facepalm
4821440	4821940	emoji.
4822720	4825840	And then later there was, Roast well deserved.
4825840	4830400	We'll take this L cause playing single player games actually makes them an 11.
4831680	4833040	I mean, and keep in mind.
4833040	4834560	Oh, that's so cringe.
4834880	4845200	And keep, keep in mind that EA's best games, like their top selling games were the Sims
4845760	4851200	series and Dragon Age Inquisition, which guess what that was?
4851200	4851920	Single player.
4853840	4860240	And when we had great multiplayer in Mass Effect, they took the servers down, which
4860240	4862000	was terrible.
4862400	4872240	But they're really trying to, to, I think, promote more with putting out, like putting
4872240	4877440	more of the effort into the multiplayer live service games like FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends,
4877440	4880160	and working on more monetization through them.
4881040	4886560	But the other thing that they're doing is that they're making all these investments
4887280	4894160	into other companies and canceling them, like with Visceral Games, which they, what turned
4894160	4897440	into EA Redwood that did Dead Space.
4898800	4906480	Yeah, they're, they're just shutting down studios that have put out good things because
4906480	4907680	they think it's too risky.
4908480	4918880	And again, they're, you know, their multiplayer is being removed from upcoming games.
4918880	4927520	You know, there was that Dragon Age Dread Wolf would have multiplayer, but I think they're
4927520	4929520	kind of going back and forth on that one.
4929520	4933200	And speaking of which, thank God BioWare is still around and that they haven't been shut
4933200	4935440	down by EA like, you know, other companies.
4938080	4945440	But they've also stepped in it when they said that some games would be online only, like
4945440	4948080	when they were going to make Sims 4 online only.
4948720	4953200	And then, I mean, they've...
4953760	4957840	Well, there was that whole SimCity was online only and boy, did they shit for that.
4958800	4968640	Yeah, but the thing that, that while these other companies are, you know, really, you
4968640	4976320	know, taking it, you know, because of their own internal misconduct or overtime practices,
4976320	4986800	you know, just abusing their employees, Blizzard is, not Blizzard, but EA is more like
4988240	4994960	we're going to put this game, you're going to buy it and then we're abandoning it.
4994960	5000240	Or we think this company is going to be great under our hood, abandon, you know.
5002960	5003460	Go ahead.
5004080	5005760	I think they're just like a deadbeat dad.
5006320	5012720	The tweet just reeked of how do you do fellow kids with just, you know, trying to play on
5012720	5015520	this meme and just not really thought out.
5015600	5020400	And I want to point out something too, because a very clear difference between this and something
5020400	5025600	we were talking about earlier, we were talking about the other thing that was by Rob Gilbert,
5025600	5031200	a person, and, you know, who is, you know, trying to do a good thing and make some art here
5031200	5032880	and not okay to get dunked on.
5033920	5040480	EA writing that tweet, a corporation trying to be the next Wendy's or God now Radio Shack
5040480	5049040	on Twitter, Radio Shack is now like the new bar for corporations trying to do a thing on Twitter.
5049040	5053040	It makes me sad that my spouse no longer works for them.
5053920	5058880	Well, I think the whole thing is about crypto anyway, so I'm not sure.
5058880	5059120	Yeah.
5059120	5060320	So I'm kind of like-
5060320	5066560	But I mean, it was, I bet if he said, oh yeah, I work at Radio Shack and it would be like,
5066560	5068800	oh, but does the cool tweet say something clever?
5069760	5070260	Yeah.
5071760	5077680	Questbuster in chat, I love this comment, says funny coming from a company that got its start,
5077680	5079280	oops, it's just scrolling off the screen.
5079280	5083760	Funny from a company that just got its start from games like Archon and Mule.
5084960	5086800	Some of the best games ever made too.
5086800	5090400	I don't think they've made a game that good since then, so oof.
5091360	5098160	So anyway, yeah, EA just next time don't tweet that.
5098800	5104000	Just, you need better PR people to do your social media.
5104960	5108000	Or the thing is that tweet didn't even,
5109040	5112320	that tweet just kind of reeked of like written in a boardroom.
5112320	5114880	That's what it is, I think the difference is.
5114880	5116640	It's probably why it's so late coming out too.
5117600	5122480	Radio Shack is somebody's alt account on their phone who gets high and decides to work.
5122480	5123680	That's cool.
5123680	5127680	But like the EA one, I don't know.
5129360	5134560	I'm reminded of that Saturday Night Live sketch and I don't think there's been a better sketch
5134560	5137360	recently with the whole, God, what was it?
5137360	5142080	It was Harry Styles was the guest and he was pretending to be a social media intern for,
5143360	5144160	what was the company?
5144160	5149360	Was it Hostess or Little Debbie or one of those like snack cakes companies or something like that?
5150640	5155520	And the tweets, they read to him what he wrote on the Instagram account and all this stuff.
5155520	5158000	It was just, anyway, I'm sorry, I'm not doing this justice.
5158000	5158880	But it was really funny.
5158880	5163520	I think I've actually watched Saturday Night Live on purpose since the 90s.
5163520	5168080	No, this is the one worth watching is when he's, God damn it.
5168080	5169920	What was somebody in chat, saved by ass here.
5169920	5172240	What was the social media brand he was pretending to be?
5172240	5174240	Was it Little Debbie or something like that?
5174240	5175200	Like the snack cakes?
5175920	5176400	I don't know.
5177360	5180720	But he was running their Instagram and he was writing all these nasty things like,
5182560	5184560	maybe I'll go out tonight and get railed.
5184560	5186800	Skull, skull, skull, hey plant, hey plant.
5186800	5190720	And he tweeted it like, what did you mean when you said this?
5192720	5193280	I remember that.
5193280	5194240	That was funny.
5194240	5195280	Yeah, it was great.
5195280	5196960	Thank you, Sarah Lee.
5196960	5198240	It was Sarah Lee.
5198240	5200640	I honestly don't think that sounds funny.
5201360	5201680	It was.
5202400	5203440	It wasn't just that.
5203440	5204880	It's funny.
5204880	5205600	All right.
5205600	5206960	Anyway, let's move on.
5206960	5207920	We have more stories.
5208480	5209360	I think we're to Loki.
5210320	5210720	Yep.
5210720	5212560	Let's talk some more layouts again.
5212560	5221840	So this time it is the game engine unity and they are deciding to they're going to be laying
5221840	5222640	off, I guess.
5223760	5229280	I can't remember which percentage it was of it about slightly more than 200 people or
5229280	5231200	4% of its total workforce.
5233040	5237200	Basically, as part of a continued planning process where we regularly assess our resourcing
5237200	5242000	levels against our company's priorities, we decided to realign some of our resources to
5242000	5245120	better drive focus and support for our long term growth.
5247840	5254480	So, yeah, not really sure what that refocus is, but yeah, it's more layoffs.
5255920	5256880	Joy, joy.
5260720	5261360	All right.
5261360	5263920	Well, we'll see.
5263920	5264320	We'll see.
5265200	5266720	That's unfortunate.
5266720	5269600	I would have thought that Unity's making a lot of money, too.
5269600	5271440	So it's just kind of surprising to me, to be honest.
5272880	5276640	You know, I would think more people are game developing, especially in light of the pandemic
5276640	5277120	and everything.
5277120	5279840	It's just more people taking up Unity and stuff.
5279840	5280240	I don't know.
5280240	5285360	Maybe they just maybe their plans made them a lot bigger than they ended up being.
5285360	5285840	I don't know.
5285840	5286320	It's weird.
5286960	5291280	That's just one of those where I'm like, I don't understand how did Unity not meet expectations?
5291280	5292880	I guess they set the bar too high.
5292880	5294080	That's a boardroom's fault.
5295200	5295520	All right.
5298160	5299920	Going on to our next story.
5299920	5304160	I mentioned this earlier in the program because Bobby Black Wolf, who's on live before us,
5305520	5310160	was here and talking about this show from this last week.
5310160	5316080	But it's Summer Games Done Quick, and Summer Games Done Quick raised over, if you can believe
5316080	5320960	it, $3 million for Doctors Without Borders.
5320960	5326160	And it was nice because it was the first year where it was back in person.
5327120	5331600	And, you know, so Bobby was talking a little bit about that, that they were back in person.
5331600	5336080	And they actually met $3 million and barely.
5336080	5342480	They met it right at the end when a bonus of an Elden Ring was on the line.
5342480	5346000	And they damn near weren't able to do it because they didn't get the money.
5346000	5346880	But then they did.
5346880	5348160	They raised that $3 million.
5348160	5353600	And then you can just see the people that are in the room just cheering and so happy
5353680	5357520	and really excited that they had hit that $3 million goal there.
5357520	5359360	And, you know, that's no small amount of money.
5360960	5365520	You know, for a lot of the crap that gamers get in this day and age, it's always nice
5365520	5369680	to have a story that talks about, here's a lot of the really, really good stuff that
5369680	5370960	gaming culture does.
5370960	5376960	And, you know, Games Done Quick, whether it's Awesome or Summer, is just a great thing for
5376960	5378000	a lot of reasons.
5378960	5381520	And obviously the money they're raising is one of them.
5381520	5384480	So again, I'll encourage you to go listen to Bobby's show if you want to hear more
5384480	5388000	about kind of the behind the scenes and all that stuff and what it was like at the event
5388000	5389120	back in person.
5389120	5395440	But a job well done by everyone, all the speedrunners, all the donators, you know, everybody.
5396000	5402560	I also understand that the person who has been running Games Done Quick for some time,
5403520	5406480	Sumichu, is actually departing.
5406480	5409360	Or I should say, obviously, it takes a village, it takes a team.
5409360	5410560	It's not all one person.
5410560	5415680	But, you know, she's like the executive, basically the, you know, what is the official
5415680	5416080	title?
5416080	5418080	Sorry, there we go.
5418640	5423120	Director of Marketing and Business Development, as well as other roles, said her goodbyes
5423120	5423680	and so forth.
5423680	5429600	So I hate to be the person that's going to step in and fill those shoes, because if you
5429600	5433840	look at everything that Games Done Quick has accomplished in the past eight years, she
5433840	5435760	set a very high bar.
5435760	5439440	So job well done and retirement well earned for her.
5439440	5441520	And nobody can fault her.
5441520	5445920	I'm sure it's a lot of pressure and a lot of time to do something like that.
5445920	5448480	So, you know, we all tip our hats.
5448480	5451440	Congrats on making that transition back to in person.
5451440	5453200	Hopefully the next one's in person, too.
5453200	5455280	I mean, no one can say for sure at this point.
5455280	5458000	But yeah, job well done and all that good stuff.
5458000	5460640	And, you know, again, $3 million for charity.
5461440	5462160	That's awesome.
5462160	5464400	Gamers doing great things, for sure.
5465440	5465760	All right.
5466400	5468400	Definitely people start sticking the eye.
5468400	5468880	What's that?
5469520	5471360	It's a definitely beats a sharp stick in the eye.
5471360	5472080	Yes.
5472080	5475040	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, we need more stories like this in this day and age.
5475040	5475680	Yes, we do.
5475680	5476320	We really do.
5476880	5477360	All right.
5477360	5482160	Let's get to our next segment and revisit some classic times, shall we?
5492640	5498160	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5498160	5500480	out a classic and tell you about it.
5500480	5503120	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5504560	5509440	But once a month, Dark Sakura picks a handheld electronic device.
5509440	5512320	And so Dark Sakura, what is the classic handheld of the month?
5513600	5517280	Classic handheld of the month is Bandai Terror House.
5518160	5528000	Um, it was actually in their second series of their handhelds.
5529520	5536000	So basically to go back into the history of these things is they were called the Bandai LCD
5536000	5536720	solar power.
5537600	5546320	And the very first ones had one screen, little LCD screens, and the games that were out for
5546320	5553040	it were Invaders of the Mummy's Tomb or Nazo no Pyramid, Escape from the Devil's Doom,
5553040	5563840	Tengoku to Jigoku, Subattack or Gekisen U-Boat, Breakout, which is a daidaso, Shark Island,
5564480	5572880	Kyofu no Mujinto, and then Nazo no Chuu Botsu Sen that only came out in Japan.
5572880	5575840	So the second series is a double panel series.
5575920	5581680	We could even say that this might have been an inspiration for the DS, maybe.
5582640	5588400	But the games that came out were Amazon or Hikio Amazon, Terror House, the one that I
5588400	5596640	brought up or Akurio no Yakata, Frankenstein or Mr. Franken, and Airport Panic, same name
5596640	5597120	in Japan.
5597840	5603360	So as for the people who are watching live, you can see that it's got like the little
5603920	5608800	LCD characters that just sort of pop on and move across, very game and watchy.
5610400	5616240	And this one was considered probably one of the favorites.
5617040	5627600	So a little bit more about this, too, is that like for Terror House, the dual panel on it
5628400	5634560	is actually stacked piece by piece.
5634560	5641920	And by the way, when I meant the DS, I meant like the 3DS, because it has that built-in
5641920	5647840	sort of 3D effect where it uses two panels.
5648800	5656880	And it's not like the same sort of semi-lenticular one that the DS has, but it uses
5658320	5660400	sort of that same allusion to it.
5661680	5669280	So the series, the LCD Solar Power series, were first made by Bondi in 1982.
5670720	5674960	The double panel series came out, of course, a little bit after that.
5674960	5683840	And they also had more variation in gameplay, and you could progress in two stages.
5684400	5686000	So it was pretty cool that way.
5687600	5689120	And I mean, think about it.
5689120	5691280	These little games are easy to carry around.
5691280	5699760	They're sort of like I was talking about the game and watch as a relative of it.
5700640	5706960	But I mean, keep in mind, too, without this, would we have had our Tamagotchi or Digimon?
5708480	5709840	These certainly led up to it.
5710400	5710900	Yeah.
5712160	5717920	Now, they had other games that were flip cases or had up to three LCDs.
5719520	5722800	But those came out later than that.
5723440	5729280	So this is really going to be kind of like the big one for their early electronic games.
5730160	5735360	Terror House, in particular, was...
5737920	5741760	I want to say that this was one of the more popular ones that came out.
5743840	5750560	And of course, as far as variations of this particular game, they're saying that between
5750560	5756720	5,000 and 10,000 variations on this release were made.
5757680	5761120	This is also one of the ones that came out in the United States.
5762800	5764000	So there you go.
5764960	5765460	All right.
5765920	5767760	Your classic handheld of the month.
5768320	5772720	As Questpuster in chat says, Simon Belmont's long lost adventuring ancestor.
5773760	5774640	Maybe in some ways.
5776000	5777360	He predates.
5777360	5780800	I completely understand the comparisons you're making, though, to the 3DS.
5783040	5785520	It does look like an early, early version of that.
5785600	5788880	It looks like, oh, this is what a 3DS in 1982 would look like.
5789920	5790880	It kind of does.
5790880	5794240	It's kind of neat to think that whether intentional or not,
5794240	5796560	it almost looks like an early version of that in some ways.
5797680	5803840	One thing I was thinking is that lenticular photography had existed.
5805520	5807920	I want to say since the 50s or 60s.
5807920	5812000	What was that thing, the 3D wheel thing that was huge when we were kids?
5812800	5815360	You know, with the little photodisc in there?
5815360	5816320	View master.
5816320	5816960	View master.
5816960	5817600	Yeah, yeah.
5817600	5819600	It's kind of similar to that, right?
5821040	5822160	Well, maybe not.
5822160	5823280	A little bit, yes.
5824320	5827760	What I'm thinking of is the souvenir thing that my mom had.
5828640	5834240	And it was almost like a quad pyramid-ish.
5834240	5837120	It expanded out and it had a magnifying glass on one side.
5837680	5841040	And on the inside, it had a little picture of, funny enough,
5841360	5843120	funny enough, of my mother in a bikini.
5843920	5847200	But it was a lenticular, well, sort of a lenticular image
5847200	5849760	where one was layered over the background,
5849760	5853200	sort of like her part was cut out to stand on top of it.
5855120	5858160	But with the 3DS, it was that full on,
5858160	5860880	like, you know how you couldn't look at the game from the side?
5862000	5865360	Because it was using that same basis as those pictures
5865360	5868720	that you can turn to the side and make them move or animate.
5869360	5871360	You know, it was something like that.
5871360	5873760	But that technology existed for a while.
5873760	5876800	You know, I would have thought that something like that
5876800	5881840	would be able to be incorporated even as far back as the early 80s.
5881840	5885840	But this is still pretty, pretty smart.
5885840	5886240	Yeah.
5886240	5888480	You know, pretty smart use of the technology
5888480	5889760	that was available at the time.
5890640	5892400	Now I'm thinking about the view master.
5892400	5893440	Like, those are so cool.
5893440	5895680	I wonder where I could find one of those in this day and age.
5896480	5898160	They rebooted them at some point, right?
5898720	5899280	They did.
5900000	5904560	Now, there was another thing that I had that looked like an old video camera.
5904560	5904880	Oh.
5904880	5907200	And you put in these big cartridges.
5907200	5908240	They're by Fisher Price.
5908240	5908740	Yep.
5909440	5910880	And then you would play it.
5910880	5914320	And I had a Daffy Duck one, I think.
5914960	5921200	And then I had a Tweety one that was the one with Sylvester in the junkyard with the dog.
5922080	5924400	Well, it's literal film, right?
5924400	5925200	It is.
5925200	5925840	Yeah, it's like that.
5925840	5928960	Because the view master with those little wheels you put in there,
5928960	5930960	those were like pieces of film that would be in there.
5930960	5934160	That was like having a personal slide projector.
5934160	5934560	Yeah.
5934560	5935060	Yeah.
5936640	5940720	But the little camera thing to me was the neatest.
5940720	5943520	Because then, you know, of course there's no audio to it.
5943520	5944320	How could there be?
5945360	5947520	It's all mechanical.
5947520	5948960	But those things were so cool.
5948960	5951920	And I want to say I thought they tried to re-release those too.
5952800	5958480	Um, and I found mine again when I was an adult, but it had been crushed.
5959520	5965520	Here's how they did audio, at least on the view master, is you would have the record.
5965520	5969200	And then the record would say, click to the next frame when you hear the chime.
5969840	5971040	You know, and it would tell a story.
5971920	5973840	And you go to the next thing.
5973840	5976080	Okay, so let me ask you if you remember this.
5976720	5981200	Because it was, and I know I'm going a bit nostalgic on this one, but do you remember
5982400	5985760	was it Burger King or McDonald's that had the deal with gremlins?
5986880	5990800	Where you would buy the little picture book and it had the album in the back.
5992000	5995200	And everyone was trying to get them and there was like
5995200	5999280	the sixth one and the second one where they're short packs kind of.
5999280	6004880	I vaguely remember it, except my mom kind of shielded me from the gremlin stuff.
6004880	6005840	I don't think she liked it.
6006400	6011440	Mom, I went with my friend's big sister to go see it.
6012240	6014320	Because it was, you know, early PG-13.
6014320	6014820	Yeah.
6015760	6018160	I saw it when I was 11, I want to say.
6019440	6024960	But at any rate, they had this thing where, you know, with the Happy Meal,
6024960	6028080	you'd get a whole book and a little vinyl with it.
6028800	6032320	Mine warped because someone left them in the back seat of the car.
6033520	6039760	But you can also unwarp an album pretty easily if it's flimsy enough.
6040720	6046160	So I had one that had wave patterns on them,
6046160	6048400	and we managed to get it flattened back out where it would work.
6049600	6053280	Didi Archaholic in chat, which, hello, great to see you again,
6053280	6055840	even when it's not the 20th anniversary, excited to have you back,
6056400	6060560	says they were also three dimensional, talking about the Viewmaster.
6060560	6062480	And that's what was so amazing, really.
6062480	6066880	Yes, that's what it was, was that whole fact that it wasn't just a colorful picture
6066880	6069600	if you were holding it up to the light, but it was three dimensional as well.
6070160	6072160	Had that slightly different left and right photo.
6072880	6075680	So that's what kind of made me think of the stuff Jamie was talking about,
6075680	6078640	even though, yeah, I'm mixing up some things.
6078640	6082160	But hey, trip down memory lane. Viewmaster was great.
6082960	6085440	I found the Fisher Price movie viewer.
6085440	6087040	Yeah, they're talking about that in chat.
6088160	6088640	There's a link.
6089440	6090640	There's where you can buy one.
6091280	6091780	Wow.
6093360	6094960	They still make them to this day.
6095920	6099120	Well, it was when they were doing the classic toys,
6099120	6104560	because they also had the telephone thingy and the little bubble vacuum thing
6104560	6107280	that had the little plastic balls that would shoot around.
6107280	6109600	And there's a Viewmaster and similar items, of course.
6110320	6111360	Uh huh.
6111360	6119520	They also did like a they tried to use the Viewmaster name as well for like a mobile hand.
6119520	6124560	It's like, you know how the for a while there, like mobile VR was kind of popular
6124560	6128880	with all those different like Google cardboard and stuff like that.
6128880	6131040	So there's a lot of companies making really cheap
6132720	6136480	VR goggles, almost that you could strap to your phone.
6136480	6137920	And Viewmaster did that.
6138720	6139220	OK.
6139220	6146880	You know what's funny is that I just found an eBay auction where they're selling the old cartridges.
6147680	6149920	And so I can see the ones that I have.
6149920	6153360	So I actually had Lonesome Ghosts, which was a Disney one,
6154080	6158080	where Mickey, Donald and Goofy are ghost hunters.
6159040	6164960	I had the Sylvester and Tweety one, and I had the Roadrunner one.
6165840	6166160	Wow.
6166160	6168640	So those were the three that I had now that I'm looking at them.
6170240	6170740	All right.
6171440	6172160	Yeah, I'm sorry.
6172160	6174080	I had I tripped on every lane.
6174080	6174580	It's all good.
6175200	6178480	I wish I could remember the cool Viewmasters I had, but it's been so long.
6178480	6179680	Some various Disney ones.
6179680	6180320	I know that.
6180320	6181600	So all right.
6181600	6182480	This is great.
6182640	6183840	We should be so happy.
6183840	6186880	We should go back to games, though, and talk about some rapid fire news.
6186880	6189600	Some other headlines around the industry a little quicker.
6189600	6190100	Loki.
6190800	6196000	You know, this is with all the crap we give Atari about, like some of their dumb projects
6196000	6199520	that they kick out, like the VCS and stuff like that.
6200240	6205280	This Atari anniversary collection is pretty awesome looking.
6205280	6206800	This Atari 50.
6206800	6207360	Yeah.
6207360	6207860	Yes.
6207860	6208880	The Atari 50.
6208880	6210560	It's the anniversary celebration.
6210560	6217200	They say it's got 90 games included with it from everything from the 2600 up through the
6217200	6220240	Jaguar, and they even include the Atari Lynx in there as well.
6220960	6222160	And not only does it.
6222960	6228400	Yeah, not only does it have all of that, but it's got, you know, different folks talking
6228400	6232800	about the games, kind of like almost like a documentary type of thing with it.
6232800	6238240	And they've even created five new games to the collection as well.
6238240	6240240	So digital clips is putting this together.
6240240	6243920	And yeah, I'm actually kind of looking forward to that.
6243920	6249280	My only issue with this, because this sounds awesome, is I'm like, God, this is like 15
6249280	6253360	years past the time they should have done this and reinvented some of their class.
6253360	6256480	This is long overdue, but you know what?
6256480	6257200	We'll take it.
6257200	6260800	And just the fact that I know Tempest 2000 is in this clip.
6260800	6265520	So the fact that like we're going to get like Jaguar in this as well and just some of those
6265520	6269760	awesome games, this looks really exciting, I got to say.
6269760	6274000	And I don't often say that about Atari like ever so anymore.
6274000	6275280	So this is pretty cool.
6275280	6276080	Wait, wait, wait for it.
6276080	6277680	They say early classics.
6277680	6278160	There it is.
6278160	6278560	There it is.
6278560	6280640	That's that's Tempest 2000 right there.
6280640	6282240	So very cool.
6284560	6287040	I freaking love Tempest 2000.
6287040	6287600	I know me too.
6287600	6289760	I'm like, that'll make it recharge.
6289760	6291200	That'll make it worth the money right there.
6292160	6293280	So what else, Loki?
6293680	6298400	And then along with that, you know, we have a lot of game companies talking about what
6298400	6299120	they're working on.
6299120	6301920	Well, Sucker Punch is going to tell you what they're not working on.
6301920	6307120	And that is, of course, a new game in the Infamous and Sly Cooper franchise.
6307760	6311920	As right now, they said, as our games continue to grow in scale and complexity, they require
6312480	6315680	the full attention of our studios with a focus on our current project.
6315680	6318720	We have no plans to revisit Infamous or Sly Cooper right now.
6319440	6322400	That doesn't mean forever, but just like right now, at least.
6322960	6323520	Yeah.
6323520	6325200	But games take a while to make.
6325200	6325520	Yeah.
6325520	6329200	And we had, I think, an Infamous and Sly Cooper game back on PlayStation 4.
6329200	6330400	It hasn't been that long.
6330400	6330900	Yeah.
6332080	6332960	So, all right.
6332960	6334080	Darsakura, what do you have for us?
6335360	6338240	Oh, some Sega Genesis stuff.
6338240	6342400	So there's four Sega Genesis games that were added to Nintendo Switch online.
6344000	6348320	We have Mega Man, The Wily Wars.
6348960	6350720	We have Comic Zone.
6350720	6352000	We have Target Earth.
6352000	6358800	And then, dun dun dun, Zero Wing, which had some of the best music and worst translation ever.
6360000	6361840	Zero Wing is such a fucking good game, though.
6365200	6368720	And then, that was it for me.
6369280	6370000	Yep.
6370000	6374000	But yeah, Zero Wing of the Infamous All Your Base Are Belong to Us meme.
6374000	6379120	And nobody can remember, unless you're a classic gaming connoisseur like Darsakura,
6379120	6380400	what the actual game looked like.
6381040	6383600	But the game is fucking great.
6383600	6388240	But the music in it, the music is so good.
6388240	6388740	Yeah.
6389600	6390100	Yeah.
6390640	6392000	How dare it be that good?
6392000	6395840	And I am really excited for the Mega Man Wily Wars, too.
6395840	6400480	Even though, I don't know, some people took issue with the Genesis collection of it,
6400480	6402400	like, because, you know, it did some things differently.
6402400	6405440	But I just think it's a collection a lot of people kind of forget about.
6406080	6411760	And the fact that it kind of re-looked at Mario 1, 2, and 3 in a similar way that, like,
6412320	6416720	Mario All-Stars did, where it's like, it wasn't that long after the original releases, right?
6416720	6418000	So it's kind of neat.
6419040	6421360	So these are some good releases, that's for sure.
6421360	6422240	I'm excited about that.
6422240	6422740	Indeed.
6423280	6423780	Yeah.
6424400	6427840	I still don't have the Nintendo Online Plus or whatever it's called.
6427840	6430560	I still haven't been convinced to upgrade to that, but maybe soon.
6430560	6431060	We'll see.
6431680	6432080	All right.
6432080	6435920	Well, let's check out some releases coming out real soon around the world.
6435920	6437760	So, Loki, we'll start in the US.
6438800	6439300	Yes.
6439300	6441920	So we have a game called Arcade Geddon,
6442640	6447680	which is on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6448960	6452160	Eurokill, the culmination game.
6452160	6457920	And that's going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
6458880	6464320	Uh, Match Point Tennis Championships on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,
6464320	6466880	PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6467600	6470560	And, let's see, Ruins Magus on PC.
6471760	6480000	AI, The Somnium Files, Nirvana Initiative on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6480640	6489920	Klonoa Fantasy Reverie Series on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,
6489920	6497040	Xbox Series, and then a game called Madison on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,
6497040	6498640	and Xbox Series.
6498640	6499140	That's it.
6499680	6500800	Traveling to Japan.
6500800	6503120	It's kind of a quiet week on the Nintendo Switch.
6503120	6506400	Really, the only release this week is Klonoa Fantasy Reverie Series.
6507040	6509200	And that is coming out on July 7th.
6509200	6511920	But that is, like, the only release on the Switch this week.
6511920	6516320	When you go to the PlayStation 5, you get Match Point Tennis Championships is coming out there,
6516320	6520000	as well as that same Klonoa game is also out on the PlayStation 5.
6520720	6523040	But really, that seems to be it for the week.
6523040	6526320	It's a pretty quiet week in Japan, just those few releases.
6526320	6530080	I should point out, though, that PlayStation 4 is also getting those games.
6530080	6533840	So, also, FIFA 22 gets a price reduction.
6533840	6535280	It goes into the best hits collection.
6535760	6541280	But also on the PlayStation 4, there is a game called My Girlfriend is a Mermaid?
6541280	6541920	Refine.
6542800	6544320	That is the name of the game.
6545200	6546400	My Girlfriend is a Mermaid?
6548880	6554160	So does she lure unwitting sailors to their deaths?
6554160	6556000	If the game is cool, then yes.
6556000	6558480	But I have a feeling the game is probably not that cool.
6559200	6567040	I want to be a siren and lure unsuspecting men to their doom.
6567040	6567840	DJ Rama S says-
6567840	6570960	But only specifically old Republican men.
6570960	6573360	DJ Rama S says, probably a visual novel.
6573360	6575120	And I think, ding, ding, ding.
6575120	6576160	That is probably correct.
6576880	6578720	How about the UK, Darsakra?
6579680	6587120	In the UK, on the 7th, for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, Match Point Tennis Championship Legends.
6587120	6590960	The rest of these are on the 8th for PlayStation and Switch.
6590960	6593120	We have Arcade Spirits, The New Challengers.
6594560	6599920	For those same two, plus Xbox, we have Klonoa Fantasy Reverie series.
6599920	6604160	And then also on the 8th for PlayStation and Switch, we have Madison.
6604160	6605840	Looks like some sort of horror game.
6607680	6610320	All right, we have a few more stories for y'all.
6610320	6615040	And then we're going to get to some tweets and emails from last week that we ran out of time for.
6615040	6617120	And then maybe we'll try to squeeze in a call or two.
6617680	6620240	Although I don't think we want to have another three and a half hour show tonight.
6620880	6623520	So we'll take what we have time for.
6623520	6629280	Because actually, we do have one recorded phone call I want to make sure we get to.
6629280	6631680	And I'll explain why we're doing that in a little bit.
6632720	6634880	But first, we have some more headlines.
6634880	6635280	Loki.
6636160	6636800	Yes.
6636800	6642880	So, you know, we always say to put your money where your mouth is when it comes to, you know,
6642880	6646880	trying to influence what happens in the game industry.
6646880	6654480	Well, someone took that to heart and apparently invested 5 million yen on Nintendo stock,
6654480	6660880	which was enough to get them invited to the investor board.
6661680	6669760	And once they were there, they were able to ask a question about what's going on with F-Zero,
6669760	6670400	Nintendo.
6671360	6678080	And of course, they gave them basically like, eh, we all know.
6681360	6683120	Was that the official comment?
6683120	6688400	No, the official comment, the translated comment was it's realistically
6688400	6692240	difficult to develop new titles and remakes, including sequels for every
6692240	6694000	Nintendo game that people request.
6694560	6699920	But we are very grateful and appreciative of the expectation of our fans have for our games.
6701360	6704000	You know, that's that's 5 million yen well spent.
6704000	6706000	I probably wouldn't have done that.
6706000	6708560	I know it's like it's better spent than on crypto.
6709760	6710560	There's that.
6710560	6711200	True.
6711200	6711700	Yeah.
6712720	6715760	Anyway, at least at least you still have that in shares.
6715760	6717120	So it's still worth that.
6717120	6718880	But it's like, you know, for good.
6718880	6720800	And I guess you could sell that later.
6720800	6726240	Just just to note for those that are watching live at Twitch, we are showing some B-roll of
6726320	6731760	F-Zero GX from the GameCube, just so you can remember what a fucking good game it was and
6732560	6734720	understand why somebody had to ask this question.
6737280	6738400	It is such a good game.
6739040	6741760	And Mike Deff says, don't worry about this guy losing money.
6741760	6743360	He's probably going to earn money.
6743360	6744400	Yeah, I mean, that's true.
6744400	6745600	He bought stock.
6745600	6747920	He didn't just throw it in the toilet to get this question.
6747920	6751760	So he'll probably actually end up making money on this.
6751760	6755680	You know, if he can hold it to a point when, you know, Nintendo announces, you know,
6756240	6759440	the release date for Breath of the Wild 2 or something like that, that's for sure.
6760000	6762480	So remember, this is how you get a say in the company.
6763040	6763680	That is it.
6763680	6768480	I mean, hey, this is a well, well played example.
6769200	6769760	All right.
6769760	6771120	I think we're over to Dark Soccer next.
6772480	6773440	All right.
6773440	6777440	Well, we have some news for BioWare.
6777440	6784880	They have hired the writer who worked on Deus Ex and Guardians of the Galaxy from Eidos
6784880	6785520	Montréal.
6786560	6797440	Mary Demarle, who was a long time person with Eidos Montréal, is now working with BioWare.
6797440	6802080	She is, I'm trying to double check something on here.
6803440	6809040	The thought is that she may be with the New Dragon Age or Mass Effect game.
6809760	6815440	But I think it could be a good thing.
6815440	6819840	You know, both of those games were great, especially Guardians of the Galaxy.
6819840	6823200	You know, the writing for that was just top notch.
6823200	6825200	So I have high hopes.
6825200	6828000	If she's in there for Mass Effect, I'm down.
6829760	6834240	Yeah, that Guardians of the Galaxy turned out a lot better than people thought it would.
6834240	6835600	So it's good.
6836320	6836880	Yeah.
6836880	6837920	So pretty cool.
6838640	6839360	Yeah.
6839360	6839860	All right.
6840400	6842320	Unfortunately, we have some sad news.
6842320	6842820	Loki?
6844080	6844580	Yes.
6845120	6851440	So unfortunately, this week we lost a very influential content creator by the name of
6851440	6854880	Alex, who went by Technoblade.
6854880	6858800	And he was a content creator for Minecraft, obviously.
6860480	6862800	Very well known for PvP.
6862800	6866400	He did a lot of stuff in Hypixel.
6866400	6868560	Had a really, you know, great following.
6868560	6870640	Just kind of a wholesome content creator.
6871440	6877440	Unfortunately, he lost the battle with Sarcoma and he passed away at the age.
6877440	6879200	I think it was 23.
6879200	6879520	Yeah.
6879520	6879920	Yes.
6879920	6881040	Just 23.
6881040	6882720	That's so, so sad.
6884480	6884880	Yeah.
6884880	6887280	So it is very sad.
6888000	6890560	Unfortunately, I never really watched his content.
6890560	6895440	I knew of him through kind of watching stuff Dream because he's kind of had like a friendly
6895440	6900880	rivalry with him because they're both kind of, you know, into the PvP stuff like that.
6901520	6907520	So I was aware of him, but didn't know kind of, you know, the type of content that he
6907520	6908080	made stuff.
6909760	6913360	But yeah, I mean, obviously everyone's kind of taken it very hard.
6914000	6915440	They've lots of tributes.
6916960	6924320	Mojang actually put a crown on the pig in their like splash screen for the Minecraft
6924320	6929920	launcher, which is very nice because his avatar was kind of this crowned pig, which
6929920	6930560	is kind of cool.
6931280	6932640	That is a very nice gesture.
6932640	6937600	Yeah, it's just very, very, you know, sad.
6938640	6943920	Like the last video that was on his channel is actually his dad that was released talking
6943920	6948560	about, you know, him dying and like all this stuff like he wanted to do.
6948560	6954240	Basically, like he wanted to put out a video to kind of tell the fans what was going on.
6954880	6960720	So he was able to kind of write a short message for his fans and basically just passed away
6960720	6962480	about eight hours after that.
6962480	6965280	So yeah, very sad.
6965280	6970240	Yeah, I actually I'm not familiar with the content creator because I'm not as embedded
6970240	6973760	in the Minecraft scene, certainly as much as you are, Loki or, you know, so forth.
6973760	6977360	But I did watch because it was going around Twitter.
6977360	6983200	I did watch a little bit of that last video and like not even knowing the individual like
6983200	6986000	that last video was very, very impactful.
6986640	6990720	And yeah, it's really just such a young age for that.
6990720	6991680	So, so sad.
6991680	6997200	So yeah, Darktucia says it's always nice to see devs doing that tip of the hat to one
6997200	6998320	of their fans.
6998320	7001760	I think I remember hearing something similar in WoW at one point.
7001760	7007360	Yeah, Warcraft and I think some of the other MMOs, to be fair, have done like a character
7008320	7014080	in the game is like memorialized in game, like as an actual NPC.
7014080	7019120	Like I know I remember an old friend from the Hoard House days had a husband who had
7019120	7020240	passed away tragically.
7020240	7025920	And that husband is a Warcraft character in the Pandaren expansion that you can go visit.
7026720	7030560	And I remember there was an episode of Hoard House where we talked about it a little bit
7030560	7037040	and, you know, kind of was an odd bit of comfort where he could go visit him in the virtual
7037040	7041840	space, which is just this very interesting thing that only gaming can really give us,
7042400	7044880	which is very, very interesting.
7044880	7049120	Unfortunately, I have no idea where to get that episode anymore because Hoard House doesn't
7049120	7050000	need an archive.
7053920	7057840	It was a great show for its time, but for its time.
7058720	7059120	All right.
7060800	7066320	Anyhow, let's try to end on a little bit more of a lighthearted note and talk about this
7066320	7072720	is, oh boy, and actually I just have to correct, Rama and Chats is probably still on iTunes.
7072720	7078480	No servers long gone, and it has been removed from iTunes and pretty much any up to date
7078480	7083040	podcast directory because the MP3s are no longer available.
7084000	7084560	There's that.
7084560	7086960	Oh, Pod Culture says I have the episodes on the server.
7088160	7090160	If you all go find them, then cool.
7090160	7094480	But just please remember the disclaimer I talk about before you go listen to old Orange
7094480	7099280	Launch Radio about content that doesn't always age gracefully because that is like double
7099280	7100480	so for Hoard House.
7100480	7106320	Again, not ashamed of the content that we did because that was a really fun time with
7106320	7106880	my friends.
7108000	7110960	But it's dated, so we've grown and learned.
7110960	7111440	Yes, we have.
7111440	7112400	We've all grown and learned.
7112400	7112720	All right.
7113520	7118560	Anyhow, let's talk about some developers that haven't learned because they are still putting
7118560	7120400	out Smurfs games.
7120400	7124160	And yes, we're going to have a Smurfs cart game that's going to be on the way.
7124720	7130800	This is a follow up to the Smurfs Mission belief, which is a platform adventure game.
7130800	7138400	The French publisher Microids is going to be making a cart racing game called Smurfs
7138400	7139120	Cart.
7139120	7142960	No, I don't have any footage to show you, and it's probably not really worth looking
7142960	7143600	at anyway.
7144480	7151600	You can choose from such Smurfs as the main one, the one with the chef's hat Smurfette.
7151600	7155120	I don't know if these are the actual names, but this article is calling them that, and
7155120	7156880	I think it would be funny if those were the names.
7156880	7160160	But I do seem to remember there was like jokey Smurf and stuff, so I think some of them do
7160160	7160960	have actual names.
7161600	7164800	My God, Rob, I'm just like now thinking of Teen Girl Squad.
7166560	7167440	How so?
7167440	7168160	Cheerleader.
7168880	7170560	What's your so and so?
7170560	7171680	What's her face?
7171680	7172560	The ugly one.
7174560	7180400	So anyway, that game will be coming out, and I'm sure you are all running to go preorder
7180400	7181360	it right now.
7182160	7183040	Smurfs Cart.
7183040	7184000	Yes, it's a thing.
7184560	7185360	Be ready for it.
7186080	7192400	All right, we're going to move into the next segment, which we're going to do some continued
7192400	7195680	talk and thank yous on the 20-year anniversary.
7196640	7202400	So last week at the end of the show, you may recall that Dark Tetsuya was trying to call
7202400	7206800	us, and he was unable to get through because of some technical issues.
7206800	7209600	And I joked with Dark Tetsuya and I said, why don't you just make a video?
7210480	7211280	Well, guess what?
7211280	7213840	Dark Tetsuya, in fact, made a video.
7213840	7219040	Now, the only unfortunate thing here is due to the technical restrictions, my co-hosts
7219040	7220400	are not going to be able to hear the video.
7220400	7222320	They'll be able to see it, but they can't hear it.
7222320	7223600	So I'm really sorry, folks.
7223600	7227440	But if I were to turn on the audio, it causes a feedback loop.
7228240	7234160	So that is an issue I have not been able to figure out yet, although I'm going to play
7234160	7234640	it here.
7235280	7238080	You guys actually have the link in the show if you want to see it.
7238640	7241680	But I will play it here and then we'll talk about it.
7241680	7246560	So let me, because I'm still trying to set up behind the scenes here, let me bring it
7246560	7251040	up and we're going to hear Dark Tetsuya giving some feedback and some memories.
7251040	7254080	Remember, Dark Tetsuya has been here since episode one.
7254720	7257200	So let's get to this.
7258480	7259360	Hey, what's up?
7259360	7260320	It's Dark Tetsuya.
7261360	7264400	So yeah, the Discord call last Sunday was a bit of a disaster.
7264400	7268640	Fortunately, Rob gave me the okay to just record something.
7268640	7269760	So here I am.
7270960	7275280	Man, I'm still kind of in shock that we just celebrated 20 years of doing a little Internet
7275280	7276880	radio thing turned podcast.
7277680	7282080	Feels like just yesterday I was sitting down at the computer that fateful Sunday night
7282080	7284000	to listen to their first episode.
7284000	7287520	I doubt any of us imagined we would still be here two decades later.
7289200	7293760	Anyway, I hope that little surprise from last Sunday was a hit with the longtime listeners.
7294400	7297920	Or heck, even anyone, any of the newcomers that might be curious.
7297920	7299520	What was the show like back in the day?
7300800	7302720	So now you can hear that one for yourself.
7302720	7307520	I was happy to be able to resurrect the archive for those fans that were curious.
7307520	7308880	For the record, it was a mess.
7308880	7311280	So the reaction to all that, it definitely made my night.
7312560	7317680	And y'all don't even want to know how many hours that repair job on episode two took.
7317680	7323760	But after they did the revisit of the first episode back in 2019, yeah.
7323760	7324800	Or no, it was 2020.
7324800	7325300	Not it.
7326960	7327920	2021.
7327920	7328560	It was last year.
7329360	7330400	What is time anymore?
7330400	7330720	All right.
7331200	7331760	Yeah.
7331760	7333920	Anyway, I knew I had to fix it before the 20th, so.
7336400	7340400	And I guess it turns out that that bowling alley from our first story, they'd finally
7340400	7342080	torn it down a couple of years ago.
7342080	7350240	So yeah, I guess I'll have the memories on that one.
7350240	7351120	Rest in piss.
7351680	7354560	As for my other favorite memories, I guess I have three of them.
7356000	7360400	Of course, the shenanigans during episode 69 were busted out Carrick Revolution and
7360400	7366480	just, and everybody sang that that was a wild time.
7367040	7367920	Poor Loki though.
7369600	7370720	I still feel kind of bad.
7370720	7372160	He did not want to do it.
7373440	7375280	He was just not into it.
7376800	7377300	But.
7378560	7378880	Okay.
7378880	7379120	Okay.
7379120	7379920	I have to pause here.
7379920	7380720	I have to pause here.
7380880	7383360	Dark Tetsuya brought up, because I know you can't hear Loki.
7383360	7386400	He brought up, he's going through his favorite moments in the show's history.
7386400	7391040	And of course, you know, a person has been listening since episode one brought up episode
7391040	7399440	69 when you did karaoke revolution and did your own rendition of I'm going out or whatever
7399440	7400480	the song was called originally.
7400480	7401920	But you changed the lyrics.
7401920	7406240	And again, it's one of those things that may be questionably his age, but you know what?
7406240	7410160	I'm going to give you a pass because it was funny, Loki.
7410160	7410400	Okay.
7411040	7413840	If you did, if you did, I don't think it was that funny.
7413840	7416000	I, but the listeners thought it was great.
7416000	7419920	So, but he's saying Loki didn't want to do it.
7419920	7420800	He didn't want to do it.
7420800	7423440	So can we, did you want to sing?
7423440	7424320	Did you, were you?
7424320	7425920	No, I did not want to.
7428480	7428980	Okay.
7429760	7431120	I'm glad we got that settled.
7431120	7431600	Okay.
7431600	7436080	Let's let me go back to the special message here from Dark Tetsuya.
7436080	7436480	I don't know.
7436480	7437840	It was still kind of a fun time.
7437840	7441440	So, and then there was that time.
7441440	7443520	It was one of our earliest episodes.
7443520	7445440	We had barely gotten into the double digits.
7445440	7450400	It was 10 and a half because it was a pre-taped thing at the arcade there, Roseville Golf Land.
7451680	7456400	So we thought we'd go down there, record the episode and, you know, just walk around, play
7456400	7458160	some of the games and all that.
7459440	7462240	It was going okay for a while, but then the management stopped us.
7462240	7467280	So then we had to wait and find out where we, were we going to get in trouble?
7467280	7468640	Was management going to kick us out?
7468640	7470000	We'd have to go to dinner early.
7471680	7476800	Luckily it turned out, they just said, you guys can stay, but you got to go back upstairs.
7476800	7483920	So we decided to just, we'll just take it and go back upstairs to finish out the show.
7483920	7487520	So it did inspire me to do a clip show.
7489040	7493920	So for those that weren't here for episode 10 and a half recorded live at Roseville Golf
7494000	7495360	Land, well, not live, no, not live.
7495360	7497520	It was recorded and then played later.
7499440	7501280	The management almost shut us down.
7501280	7505600	And that was really funny because I remember lying and saying that we were doing a project
7505600	7506800	for high school or something.
7506800	7507920	And they were like, what school?
7507920	7511680	And I named my, because I went to school in Roseville, so I knew the high schools there.
7511680	7515680	And so they were kind of giving us like a face, like, and I'm sure it was the whole,
7515680	7517040	you look too old to be in high school.
7517040	7520640	Keep in mind, I was 24 at the time, so I maybe could pass a little better.
7520960	7526400	Um, but yeah, it was just, it was, uh, it was a funny moment, uh, when the show almost
7526400	7530320	got stopped in its tracks at Golf Land, but yeah, they didn't, they didn't end up, they
7530320	7532560	didn't end us, end up throwing us out.
7532560	7534080	I mean, cause like, what were they going to do?
7534080	7534880	Call the police?
7534880	7538720	Like we would have been out of there before the police ever got there, but that was true.
7539520	7541440	We don't get paid enough to care.
7541440	7541840	That's right.
7541840	7544720	That's, and that ultimately that's what it is at the end of the day.
7544720	7546480	They don't get paid enough to care.
7546480	7549840	Let me let, uh, Dark to see it finish his video message here.
7550160	7550400	Sorry.
7550400	7551760	I keep, sorry, dark soccer.
7551760	7555200	I keep cutting in, um, but lovely hair.
7555200	7555520	All right.
7556400	7559680	Let me go back to the length of the other wig.
7559680	7560400	I understand.
7560400	7560640	Okay.
7560640	7563040	Here's the last minute or so of the message.
7563040	7564960	Cause Robin made the comment about it.
7564960	7568240	I just, just was something I'd always had in the back of my mind.
7568240	7569600	It's like, Oh, I got to do that.
7569600	7573760	So yeah, that was kind of funny.
7573760	7582320	And I'm probably biased with the number one, but back in 2017, it was January.
7582320	7590880	And I had, I had gotten to come down and see the one who'd be my eventual wife, Michigan's.
7591920	7595200	So we were hanging out and the,
7598800	7599760	Oh gosh.
7599840	7600240	Yeah.
7600240	7605760	It was, it was that Nintendo, not E3, but like the direct thing and that's in the switch
7605760	7606880	and some of the upcoming games.
7606880	7611200	So we called in, you have our thoughts on that and talk about the new Zelda coming out.
7612080	7614000	Seeing how we couldn't wait to get ahold of that.
7615280	7618240	I think we also talked a bit about that shadow run game.
7619280	7621280	Cause she was pretty into it.
7621280	7622480	So that sounds right.
7626320	7628160	That was a pretty happy memory for us.
7628160	7629920	So that we could share that with the show.
7631840	7634800	Anyway, thanks for giving me the chance to get my take on our
7635440	7637520	anniversary as turning 20 years old.
7638560	7640400	Happy anniversary to y'all now.
7640400	7641440	Send it back to you guy.
7642320	7642820	Y'all.
7644640	7646160	So I will see you in chat.
7647760	7648160	All right.
7648160	7648880	Thank you so much.
7648880	7650560	Start to see her for sending that in.
7650560	7651360	Appreciate it.
7651360	7653040	And the little walk down memory lane.
7654240	7657600	Even if you are a little biased in your number one answer there,
7657600	7659520	but I completely understand why.
7659520	7662720	And that would be when him and me called into the show together.
7663280	7667040	I think before they kind of got together together.
7667040	7668320	So pretty cool.
7669360	7672640	Especially hearing from somebody who was there the very first night,
7673280	7674800	walking down some old memories.
7675440	7677040	As Joe and Hunter Matt mentions,
7677040	7680880	I went back and read through a lot of the forums a week or so ago.
7680880	7683280	And wow, that was a trip down memory lane as well.
7683280	7683920	That's true.
7683920	7689520	Our website really is frozen in time since 2000 something.
7690400	7693520	So there's a lot of I bet there's some great forum posts.
7693520	7696640	There are some people that we haven't heard from in a very long time.
7696640	7700080	That should be a fun read sometime.
7700080	7701840	I need to do that as well.
7701840	7703040	So cool.
7703760	7709280	All right, I think we have some emails that also speak to the anniversary.
7709360	7713360	So let me kick it over to DarkSakura who opens up our mailbag.
7713360	7718320	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and read some emails for us.
7719360	7724080	All right, so I'm going to go in date order of reception.
7724720	7726640	So this one comes from Name & Lights.
7728160	7730080	Congratulations on 20 years.
7730080	7732720	I have been a listener since the All Games days.
7732720	7735760	So I am not a day one OLR listener.
7735760	7740240	I'm not able to listen to the show live because of the day and time you are on,
7740240	7742880	but have been a podcast listener since I found this show.
7743760	7747680	You have had so many great moments over the last 20 years.
7747680	7752480	I will always remember this show in 2013 when I called in after my wife passed away.
7753040	7756240	It was really rough time for me and I nearly lost everything.
7756240	7758480	I will never forget the support I got.
7758480	7760880	Things did get better and I am in a great place now.
7761520	7764640	I have messaged you all offline for things over the years
7764640	7766320	and are very easy to talk to.
7766880	7771200	I am on the East Coast so the chance of meeting any of you in person is very hard,
7771200	7772160	but maybe someday.
7772800	7776000	I have met Xtaphir on a trip to North Carolina.
7776000	7778480	Without OLR that would not have happened.
7778480	7779760	Thanks for all the years.
7779760	7786160	I won't say here's to 20 more because that number is getting too big and I will be way too old.
7786160	7791200	I will say I will be a listener to OLR until the day you do close your doors and shut down the feed.
7795200	7795840	Can I cry?
7797360	7798080	If you want to.
7798080	7798720	It's your party.
7798720	7799680	You can cry if you want to.
7800480	7802400	It's a very sweet email.
7802400	7808800	I actually recall that episode that you mentioned because it was very tricky for me trying to
7808800	7813920	navigate that and I mean that just in the way of I wanted you to have a place where you could
7813920	7820080	talk about it openly, but at the same time I was just a little worried like, oh gosh,
7820640	7825600	is he putting too much of that emotion and rawness out there, but at the same time
7826240	7831760	I think sometimes we all need a space and a place to do that and I'm glad you're able to do that.
7833280	7842800	While I can't say I understand, I don't, but I'm glad we were able to give you that space
7844000	7844800	to process that.
7844800	7848320	I'm glad that you've made some great friendships through the show as well.
7848560	7851840	It's great having you here and thank you so much for being a part of the show and the
7851840	7852640	legacy of the show.
7853680	7859760	I am, by the way, saving these emails as PDFs for something I still want to work on.
7863280	7865680	Moving on to the next one is from Ziba.
7866720	7867120	Hello.
7867760	7869520	I can't believe it's been 20 years.
7869520	7871760	I remember my first day like it was yesterday.
7871760	7873440	It was around 2009.
7873440	7878000	I was searching for a new video game music shoutcast radio station because my original
7878000	7880080	one I was listening to stopped working.
7880080	7884640	I came across OLR's website and started listening to the 24-7 stream.
7884640	7889520	I was happy to find out that the stream was not only VGM but other geeky songs too.
7889520	7895280	I made my way to the IRC room and said how happy I was to find a new shoutcast radio station.
7895280	7900000	Someone in chat, I don't remember who, told me that I should come back on Sunday night
7900000	7901360	for a live show.
7901360	7904000	I don't remember the exact episode I started on.
7904000	7907600	However, I do have so many fond memories of the years I've been listening.
7907600	7912960	All those times, Rob pressed the wrong button and Holik and the FUs of the Week music would
7912960	7916480	play and the Laughing Ferret, the Vuvuzela.
7917360	7920720	All the times, Dark Sakura would say, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
7920720	7921600	All the cage ma...
7923040	7923540	Rob!
7924560	7925060	What?
7925920	7926420	Nothing.
7926880	7929200	All the cage matches and Listless.
7929200	7936080	All of Loki's rants, President Cat, all of the food tangents and probably so much more
7936080	7938320	that I can't think of off the top of my head.
7938320	7943680	I'm so happy that I was able to meet Rob, Bobby Blackwolf and some listeners in real life.
7943680	7946160	You have made a great community over the years.
7946160	7950160	Even though I cannot stay for the live show most of the time, I'm glad that I can still
7950160	7952720	listen to the podcast the next day while I work.
7952720	7954800	Here's to the next 20 years.
7954800	7956400	Congrats, Ziba.
7956400	7957600	So great to hear from you, Ziba.
7957600	7961440	And yeah, I met you at MAGFest and it was great.
7961440	7963200	I'm so glad we got to meet up.
7963200	7970720	And you probably had told me that you found the station the way you did, but honestly,
7970720	7971360	I forgot.
7971360	7975120	And hearing it again just kind of makes me go, oh, like just hearing the ways that people
7975120	7976720	kind of discover you is very interesting.
7976720	7980960	And then it kind of, you know, I know you've also talked a lot about like OC Remix and
7980960	7984080	that type of stuff to me and helped me discover stuff over there.
7984080	7987840	So it's just it's neat how that all comes full circle.
7987840	7989360	So that's awesome.
7989360	7991680	Well, thank you for being a part of our community all these years.
7993280	7993680	Indeed.
7994320	7998320	Last email, which is also one from earlier today.
7999920	8002000	Hi, Rob, Jamie and Loki.
8002000	8003200	Happy post 20th.
8003200	8007200	Normally I'd say happy fourth, but given the state of this country, is it really happy?
8007200	8007440	No.
8008160	8008640	Is it though?
8009840	8015200	Anyway, I wanted to say a couple of things that I could not during the two minute countdown.
8015200	8020720	One, last week wasn't just OLR's 20th anniversary and your birthday, but it was also the birthday
8020720	8024560	of my first nephew, a close friend of mine who was like a sister to me.
8024560	8025840	I even call her my sister.
8025840	8030320	Gave birth to a bouncing baby boy named Alex at six forty six a.m.
8030880	8033520	Good things happen in three, as I'll tell you, too.
8034240	8037440	I know you have said from time to time the show gets political.
8037440	8038160	I digress.
8039840	8043520	Can you really call it political when the views you bring up?
8043520	8046880	We all agree on what you say, even if we don't.
8046880	8050640	Everyone in the army is adult enough to have a civil conversation about it.
8050640	8053760	It only gets political when we are screaming at each other about it.
8056640	8058320	No, it's still politics.
8058320	8061200	We just have civil political conversations.
8061200	8061700	Yeah.
8062240	8062740	Yeah.
8063520	8065760	The topic is is political.
8065760	8068560	Yeah, I get the compliment that's buried in there.
8068560	8069040	I do.
8069040	8071280	But yeah, I think what Jamie said is right.
8071280	8071780	Yeah.
8072000	8072640	Yeah.
8072640	8074720	Oh, and congrats, by the way, about your nephew.
8074720	8075220	Yeah, for sure.
8076100	8080580	So three, I was inspired by Dark Tetsuya to do something last week.
8080580	8086180	Unfortunately, I was not able to finish it in time due to various things popping up at home.
8086180	8089780	Don't worry, I am OK, but you know how it is when your hobbies get the best of you.
8090420	8095220	I'd like to present the Orange Challenge Radio 20th anniversary ending credits.
8095220	8095720	What?
8097060	8101620	Don't worry, I'm working on a 16 bit version if you don't want to use the end theme.
8102180	8105620	I hope you like it like the subtle surprises I put in there.
8106260	8109060	So stay tuned at the end of the show tonight.
8109060	8112820	We have a brand new outro, so stay tuned.
8114340	8114840	Totally.
8116260	8119060	I hope you like because I had fun working on it.
8119060	8120180	Well, that's it.
8120180	8123860	Take care and to quote VX Jason XV, see you next week.
8124660	8127060	That's from DJ Rodman S.
8127060	8132820	You have to make sure you also say it the way that Jason says it.
8132820	8133460	That's what I did.
8133460	8133940	See you next week.
8133940	8135140	No, I know you did.
8135140	8137940	But I'm telling everybody else out there, when you say that, make sure you're saying
8137940	8141620	it the way Jason says it and see you next week.
8141620	8146340	You know, you have to make sure you in that very I know we don't use the Chrono Trigger
8146340	8151060	music anymore, but I still think of it when I hear see you next week.
8151860	8153460	It's very, very nice with that.
8153540	8156500	So Bobby is commenting.
8156500	8162820	He saw that all going down, meaning the new intro coming in and out during the last.
8162820	8166500	It was actually because it all Dropbox is how we all pass files to each other.
8166500	8170580	And Bobby was live at Dropbox is like downloading the new new outro.
8170580	8173140	Not once, but twice because Rama had to fix something.
8174820	8178260	This is why I don't have my Dropbox sync.
8179380	8182100	I go to the website and get it when I want it.
8182100	8185140	That's the sink is so damn convenient, though.
8185140	8188980	And it like to be to be fair, that never happens.
8188980	8193300	But like once in 100 episodes, like something will be moved at the last minute.
8194260	8198420	Given the amount of stuff that I do through various cloud services.
8198420	8199060	Yeah, it's different.
8199060	8199700	That's different.
8199700	8205620	Yeah, I keep them all online because I basically when I'm not working, I'm streaming.
8205620	8210740	Yeah, I'm like, I'm like Rita in Power Rangers.
8210740	8211620	Make my channel great.
8213460	8216420	I'm going to chat as a show on how to Matt.
8216420	8217140	And thank you for the email.
8217140	8221620	Rama as a show on how to Matt and chat says I listened to the 20th anniversary show afterwards,
8221620	8223540	and it brought back so many good memories.
8223540	8226900	I'm a little sad I missed it live, but the memories were wonderful to hear.
8226900	8231540	I'm so happy to be part of this wonderful community for so long from all the in jokes
8231540	8232500	over the years.
8232500	8239300	Peep jousting, Ultra Kade kicking President Kat and of course, Loki is Tingle from all
8239300	8245220	the various homes live through 65 all games from all the in person meetups.
8245220	8247060	Thank you for the memories and the fun times.
8247060	8248340	Well, thank you for the sweet message.
8248340	8248980	Appreciate it.
8249540	8251060	I also want to I don't remember.
8251060	8253060	Tingle is now officially in our album art.
8253060	8253620	That is true.
8254900	8259220	I want to get to some tweets because I didn't read the tweets last.
8259220	8262980	I don't usually read all the tweets unless like one like I'm like, Oh, we have to talk
8262980	8263620	about this.
8263620	8265860	But there were a lot of very sweet things written on Twitter.
8265860	8267220	So I just want to get to some of these.
8267220	8271380	I may not get to them all because unfortunately our mentions can be kind of a mess.
8271380	8276020	So if I skipped you, I'm sorry, but please know it was seen and I appreciate all the
8276020	8276900	notes.
8276900	8281780	But I do want to say at Blue Swim tweeted happy 20th anniversary to the podcast that
8281780	8283700	made me want to become a podcaster.
8284660	8290100	I remember listening to episodes on my Sony mini disc player back around 2005.
8290100	8292580	So I've been there for most of those two decades.
8292580	8296340	Congrats, Dark Sakura, Robin, Loki on the mini disc player.
8296340	8299700	So does that mean you were burning episodes to a disc to listen?
8299700	8301460	I know there were people that did that.
8301460	8304420	They would download the MP3, then burn it to a disc and listen to it on the disc.
8305300	8306820	Any discs were rewritable.
8306820	8310260	Yeah, it's more like a zip drive, but smaller.
8310980	8312100	Yeah, that was.
8312820	8319940	And honestly, the mini disc format was a really good format, but it went the same direction
8319940	8321620	that the Betamax did.
8322660	8325460	Great technology, superior format.
8326100	8327540	No one wanted to adopt it.
8327540	8328980	Yeah, like memory stick.
8331380	8333780	All right, so the next one is a Twitter thread.
8333780	8335460	So it's three tweets I have to read.
8335460	8338340	So it's a little long, but it's great.
8339300	8343620	Garth the Wolf tweeted and said a huge congrats to OLR and their 20th anniversary of being
8343620	8345540	a gaming podcast live show.
8345540	8349860	I've been listening to them most of my life when I discovered them off a DDR forum back
8349860	8350740	in junior high.
8354260	8358740	I just want to say I'm pretty sure he's like in his 30s now, but I'm going to have a child
8358740	8359940	going into junior high.
8360980	8367140	Hey, my cat is old enough to be a fifth grader, I think.
8368980	8371220	And DDR forum, shout out to DDR Freak.
8371220	8373140	It's okay to call out DDR Freak by name.
8373140	8374180	Rest in peace.
8374180	8374500	All right.
8375060	8376020	I watched them evolve.
8376020	8377460	There's a mod there, so yeah.
8377460	8381140	Yeah, well, he did just say DDR forum.
8381140	8385380	To be fair, it could have been like Bamani style or DDR spot or one of those other sites.
8385380	8386020	It could have been.
8386020	8389860	It could have, you know, there were other forums.
8390900	8396580	Anyway, I watched them evolve as a show from live 365 to all games, then VOG and Twitch.
8397380	8400340	They're more than just a podcast I look forward to hearing every week.
8400340	8404420	The hosts of the show have legitimately given me advice on growing up as a young, confused
8404420	8407220	gay kid who is afraid of not being accepted.
8407220	8409380	They didn't need to do that, but they did.
8409380	8413140	They use their show to elevate the voices of others in the gaming community in the best
8413140	8414180	way possible.
8414180	8418100	They treat their listeners like family and won't shy away from touchy subjects that need
8418100	8418900	to be talked about.
8420420	8423060	I'll just refer to the opening of our 20th anniversary episode.
8424020	8425700	Here's to 20 more years.
8425780	8428900	Yes, 20 love y'all with a heart emoji.
8428900	8429780	Thank you so much for that.
8429780	8431380	That is really, really kind.
8431380	8431780	Thank you.
8434420	8435220	Let's see.
8435220	8437940	Going back to why does Twitter default to the wrong view?
8437940	8439620	Okay, Sturlock.
8440500	8443300	Man, I can't believe OLR is turning 20.
8443300	8448100	I've been listening since 2007, and while I'm not as active as I used to be and mostly
8448100	8450260	lurk now, I still love them.
8450260	8451140	Well, thank you for that.
8451140	8451780	I appreciate that.
8451780	8452180	And you know what?
8452180	8453780	I never liked this tweet.
8453780	8455220	So there I'm going to like that tweet.
8455220	8459060	And now you're going to see that, like, why did OLR like this tweet like two weeks later?
8459060	8462100	Well, because I just realized I forgot to heart it.
8463540	8468820	Dungeon Buster says, happy anniversary, OLR, from the days of side talk and engage the
8468820	8472980	rise of streaming and the arrival of achievements on through to the present.
8472980	8478580	For 20 years, these friends continue to share fun insights on generations of games and hardware
8478580	8480900	to the future and beyond.
8480900	8486260	And there's a lovely tweet or there's a lovely picture that goes with this that I think maybe
8486260	8488180	ties into the Engage comment.
8488180	8489140	Let me show you that there.
8489700	8493460	There's the picture that goes with that.
8493460	8498020	So a lovely cat listening to our show there on the Game Boy Advance, which I'm not even
8498020	8499060	sure is possible.
8499060	8501780	Okay, let's see.
8501780	8504340	And then Pod Culture said, OLR turns 20.
8504340	8507300	If you like fun and video games is the podcast to listen to.
8507300	8510980	They had a huge influence on the run of Pod Culture.
8512740	8514820	Let's see other tweets here.
8517380	8522820	Infendo Justin tweeted and said, I'm sad that I've not had the opportunity to listen to
8522820	8527780	OLR in years, but it has always been an amazing podcast made by amazing people.
8527780	8532820	And I can only hope that the current run of Infendo Radio lasts half as long.
8532820	8534980	Congrats, Jamie, Rob and Loki.
8535620	8542980	And then some feedback after the podcast went up, Night of Dorks, who's actually an IRL
8542980	8549220	friend of ours who is there at Golf Land back in the old days, tweeted us and said, hey,
8549220	8553460	y'all, listening to last night's show and I wanted to say how proud I am of you and
8553460	8554580	what you do.
8554580	8558020	Much love and miss seeing y'all every week at RVGL.
8559220	8560100	Thank you for the tweet.
8560100	8560900	It's very nice.
8561540	8564900	But are you missing much by not going to RVGL?
8564900	8568100	Because I don't think you are like it isn't what you remember anymore.
8568100	8570100	It's it's fair.
8570100	8576020	And the other day around one day, there's probably nothing for us at Scandia anymore
8576020	8576520	either.
8577300	8580420	I'm having gone to Scandia not that long ago.
8581460	8581960	Yeah.
8582420	8586980	The only thing it's less crowded than I remember it.
8587940	8593860	And I swear that like shooting gallery thing that they had there is much smaller than I
8593860	8594660	remember it being.
8595220	8599940	But yeah, it's it's different now.
8599940	8602420	They have roller coasters or roller coaster.
8604340	8605780	They have a roller coaster?
8605780	8606980	They have a roller coaster.
8608100	8612660	Like like a kitty one or like a like a wild mouse or something?
8612660	8615860	It's I don't know what it's necessary.
8616020	8618420	It's like the goofy flight school.
8618420	8619460	I don't know what they have.
8619460	8620740	They have a wild mouse.
8620740	8622100	Yeah, I think that's what it's called.
8622100	8623620	Yeah, I'm sorry.
8623620	8629220	I've been watching a lot of things about roller coasters lately, like especially like the
8629220	8632980	physics behind them, because, you know, I get on random tangents of things that interest
8632980	8633480	me.
8634180	8641060	And I have now learned what different kinds of roller coasters are called from super loopers
8641060	8644500	to the wild mouse model to all kinds of things.
8645220	8649780	Yeah, I was taking the kids there for a little bit and they have a bunch of like different
8649780	8651620	like carnival rides and stuff like that.
8651620	8654980	It's just kind of like a weird hodgepodge of things.
8654980	8660420	I might have to go then, although I'm not going on the the Scandia screamer out of spite
8661780	8664020	that and mortal fear for my life.
8664020	8665780	I want to get a couple other chat comments here.
8665780	8668820	And then I see we have a caller who didn't get in last week in the green room.
8668820	8670420	And I absolutely would like to hear from this person.
8670420	8671620	So I'm going to get to that.
8671620	8673620	But first, a couple of comments from chat.
8673620	8679460	Phoenix 7726 says, O.L.R. is a lot of the reason I could tell that Gamergate was horseshit
8679460	8684500	when it happened, because you all were talking about actual ethics in games journalism forever.
8684500	8686660	And you showed me what that actually looks like.
8687300	8687700	Thank you.
8687700	8692340	That's actually quite a compliment, because, you know, that whole scenario was a mess,
8692340	8694980	to put it extremely simply and lightly.
8696260	8700820	And I'm glad that we could kind of help people sort right from wrong in that situation.
8700820	8702660	That actually really does mean a lot.
8702660	8706500	And then there were a couple of comments about round one as opposed to Roseville Golf Land.
8706500	8706900	Guess what?
8706900	8711380	I went to the I actually was at the Roseville Galleria yesterday because we happen to be
8711380	8712340	going through the area.
8713700	8718340	My husband and I have to get our both of us have to get our wedding rings resized.
8718340	8720420	I think I might have mentioned this on the show a couple of weeks ago.
8720420	8724340	My wedding ring straight up fell off in the shower and almost went down the drain
8724340	8725460	because of the weight loss.
8725460	8728260	So I actually my pain very well.
8728260	8731940	Yeah, so I actually went down a ring size.
8731940	8733300	It turns out I found out.
8733300	8736740	So the place we got our rings happens to be over by the Galleria.
8736740	8739780	So we went there and still not open.
8740500	8745780	So even though they said round one was going to be the spring and then June 2022,
8745780	8750100	nope, somebody lied to us because I was there on July 2 and it still wasn't open.
8750100	8753700	And there's still just the fake wall up that you can't even see through it.
8753700	8756500	Like, I can't see what they're doing in there because they have like a fake wall up.
8756500	8758660	And it just says coming 2022.
8759220	8764340	The movie theater upstairs is hopping and running, though, because that used to be Sears.
8764900	8766980	So it used to be a two-story Sears.
8766980	8770260	So now the top story is Cinemark or something in the bottom floor.
8770260	8775380	You would think that like the top story would be round one and the bottom story would be,
8775380	8776980	you know, the movie theater.
8776980	8779780	Not with a bowling alley.
8779780	8781940	You don't want that above.
8783380	8784500	When you really think about it.
8784500	8786580	No, no, you don't want that above the movie theater.
8788420	8792020	Plus, the shaking of the movie theater base would like knock the pins over.
8794180	8795140	So it probably wouldn't work.
8796180	8796580	All right.
8796580	8800980	But I'm excited to check out that round one whenever they actually fucking open.
8800980	8805940	Anyway, we have a long time listener and participant of our show and somebody who the
8805940	8807780	show would not be possible without in our green room.
8807780	8809940	And I'm definitely bringing this person on the show.
8809940	8812260	So let's get to the phones.
8812260	8813700	Hi, you're on Orange Tons radio.
8813700	8814100	Who's this?
8814820	8817540	Well, I guess with that lead in, I got not terribly long ago.
8817540	8819620	I have to say, see you next week.
8821220	8822100	No, see you.
8822100	8823460	See you this week.
8823460	8824100	See you this week.
8824100	8825300	See you right fricking now.
8826100	8827620	Hey, Jason, it's great to hear from you.
8827620	8828660	What's on your mind, my friend?
8829380	8831700	Well, you said you didn't want another three and a half hour show.
8831700	8834900	How about I bring up a topic that'll take us to like four and a half to five hours?
8834900	8836420	Okay, sure.
8836420	8837460	Do your worst.
8837460	8838980	No, absolutely wouldn't.
8839300	8849220	Um, I, um, was, I rewrote the intro at least three or four times on figuring out how exactly
8849220	8854500	how to present the point that I was making and also cutting out a lot of my commentary
8854500	8859220	because that doesn't lend itself to 30 seconds, particularly well.
8859220	8866260	Um, I, but you do a fabulous job with those intros and I know, I know you rewrite them
8866260	8869380	often because I have the text messages to back that up.
8869380	8870100	You always do it.
8870100	8871540	You always come out winning in the end.
8872340	8873380	Thank you very much for that.
8873940	8883220	I think that crunch culture already has been, but is going to, is officially a evergreen,
8883220	8888580	actually, I think, uh, probably better said as a wedge issue to use the correct political term.
8888580	8893620	Uh, it, it is the, it is the modern political wedge issue of gaming.
8894260	8899140	Um, I, when is crunch culture?
8899140	8899640	Okay.
8903140	8910420	When you're talking about the serial captain crunch, occasionally sparingly.
8910420	8913380	And when people want to do it because they want the money.
8914340	8914740	Yeah.
8914740	8922020	So in the intro I dropped in the, uh, I dropped in Matt booty saying, uh, putting the emphasis
8922100	8923780	on the wrong details.
8923780	8926340	Um, I agree with unionization.
8926340	8930420	I agree that complaints are no doubt substantiated.
8930420	8938580	Um, but I also think that, uh, and, and, uh, uh, booty's deflection of it was all correct,
8938580	8942900	but there's another, there is one key word that at least was quoted in the article.
8942900	8947700	You know, I didn't, I didn't go deeper into the source just for my own purposes of reading
8947700	8951620	at the time he used the word bullying.
8952820	8960740	And that's really understated in crunch culture because especially in particular, like I'm
8960740	8965620	reasonably certain, uh, rockstar when they were talking, when they had their retrospective
8965620	8971780	on red dead redemption to every successful game talks about the crunch that developers
8971780	8974820	put in to, to finishing the product.
8975380	8981780	Um, and I consider myself up until a couple of years ago for a couple of significant reasons,
8981780	8988020	I consider myself all in on crunching and I am happy to do it.
8988020	8992580	And I understand other people who want to put in their time and get the hell out because
8992580	8993780	they want family.
8993780	8995540	They have their, they have their family.
8995540	8999860	They have to attend to, or because they want extracurriculars that aren't work or because
8999860	9001380	they have a life outside of work.
9002020	9006820	I, you know, you think about the whole thing broadly, the fact that crunch culture, uh,
9006820	9014340	is, is frequently discussed in Japanese cultures and not even remotely to the same extent,
9014340	9016260	not as prevalently in America.
9016820	9023540	And like, uh, there, there was the, the Google engineer that in San Francisco that didn't
9023540	9028020	have a house and just bought a, bought a van, a moving truck, something like that, and slept
9028100	9031940	in the parking lot and could go back into work to use whatever facilities he needed.
9031940	9039540	Like campuses, all of this, all of this stuff that you would call crunch exists everywhere.
9039540	9041780	Some by choice, some not.
9041780	9048100	And the problem is the, the, the definitive, uh, no, that's the wrong word.
9048100	9054820	The objective problem is bullying forced over time, et cetera.
9054820	9061620	The subjective problem is, Oh, if I don't do this, I'm going to be out of a job.
9062420	9063940	Do they feel that?
9063940	9065540	Was it implied?
9065540	9071380	Is it their own, um, uh, their own hangups from previous jobs?
9071380	9072180	Something like that.
9072180	9080500	Like it's so unfortunate that all of those possibilities exist, but depending on who
9080500	9085620	presents it, it's going to be, and, and the personal, the, the, the belief of the person
9085620	9092740	reading the article that it's only ever going to be the one thing to them and not the everything.
9096020	9103140	So what do we, what do we do moving forward saying that, you know, should, should, I mean,
9103140	9108100	yeah, some, some people are gonna want to crunch, especially if like overtime pay is involved.
9108100	9110020	You know, some people want the money, they want to do it.
9110500	9111540	But not everybody does.
9112260	9115940	So where, where do we find the can or can, yeah.
9115940	9117540	Or, you know, for a variety of reasons.
9117540	9118260	Right.
9118260	9120580	So it, I guess what is the answer?
9120580	9122660	And do we think the game industry is moving to that?
9122660	9128340	Cause I, I feel like the game industry is relenting to that pressure because you see
9128340	9134820	a willingness for games to be delayed that you didn't see before, but I don't see it
9134820	9135700	from every company.
9135700	9138260	And this, this is an interesting, this is the other part.
9138980	9146820	This is the interesting, really weird pro about the part that everybody hates, which
9146820	9151620	is all of these smaller companies are getting eaten up by, and not even small companies
9151620	9153540	are getting eaten up by larger companies.
9154500	9160340	Microsoft can delay Starfield because Microsoft has the budget and the bandwidth to be able
9160340	9160900	to do it.
9161860	9164420	A lot of studios kind of don't.
9164500	9170180	It's like, if they miss the holiday, they're not going to make the money back on the game.
9170180	9172660	And it's all, you know, it's all downhill from there.
9173380	9179220	Although I would argue, I think the last several years have shown us, you do not need to release
9179220	9184260	a game in the holiday period to set like, I think that whole like timed release thing
9184260	9187940	is really a relic of the past because the same thing is true of movies.
9188580	9192340	Yeah, movies do, they still make a little more in the summer and they do a little more
9192340	9193300	around the holiday.
9193860	9199220	That, we see movies released in February, March that make tons of money.
9199780	9201700	So I, and same thing with games.
9201700	9202980	Games are released all throughout the year.
9202980	9208500	The Switch broke the rules by not releasing for the holidays and still sold the time.
9208500	9214020	So I feel like some of the rules about when you have to release a game are changing.
9214020	9219620	And if the appropriate amount of planning goes into something, then you can try to avoid
9219620	9220020	crunch.
9220020	9227700	I, to follow that on would lead me into a topic that I, that could double the length
9227700	9229060	of the show already.
9229060	9237780	I, and you're using a few keywords that I, you are correct, all except for the definitive
9237780	9238740	nature of it.
9238740	9243380	Releasing it at the right time of the year is not going to guarantee you a success.
9243380	9246180	There is no one way to do any given thing.
9246180	9246680	For sure.
9247560	9251080	There are reasons why things happen predominantly.
9251080	9255800	Game releases on Wednesday, movie releases on Tuesday, I think it is.
9256680	9262600	You know, there are kind of these societal or situational rules that you go by that might
9262600	9264200	have specific lead-ins.
9264200	9269400	You know, a game has to certify two months before for validation and gold masters shipping
9269400	9274200	physical copies, which is less important these days, producing as many physical copies to
9274200	9275000	get out to stores.
9275000	9281080	And yes, all of that is changing for the digital distribution world, streaming of movies.
9281080	9286280	The fact that movies are big titles are day one on a streaming service is you want to
9286280	9289880	talk about a massive shift, a seismic shift in media.
9292040	9295480	So you, you're, you're saying what is the answer?
9295480	9299640	And I started this by saying that this issue is a wedge issue.
9299640	9304120	And I said that very deliberately because wedge issues don't get resolved.
9304120	9308920	And they're always the driving force for the, you know, are you, are you team this
9308920	9310120	or are you team that?
9311240	9313880	There is no the answer.
9313880	9317400	People need to do what they need to do to protect themselves.
9317400	9319720	I am in favor of unionization.
9319720	9324040	It's an interesting topic for me to think about my own role, tiny little bit different,
9324040	9330280	but the unionization initiatives I've seen in the news are a good thing.
9331240	9337080	When I think about unions that I don't like, my ex's dad was an air traffic controller
9337080	9340280	and also, uh, uh, uh, led his union.
9340280	9343240	I don't actually remember what the correct title, uh, correct title is.
9343240	9349480	Um, but like, and there's, um, not going to stray too far into it, but like police unions
9349480	9351640	that protect bad policemen.
9351640	9356840	Um, sports fans probably know this a little bit with, uh, angel, I don't remember his
9356840	9358360	last name and the MLB.
9358360	9363480	Like we can, we can point to all the issues where unionization isn't a good, and those
9363480	9365720	are the exceptions in a big, good union.
9365720	9367080	It's gonna happen.
9367080	9378760	But I do think that more AAA billions of dollars of profit, uh, um, jobs and roles need to
9378760	9386280	unionize and it will just be another point in the story of a given studio's history and
9386280	9386840	what have you.
9387800	9392120	Yeah, I, I, it's going to be very interesting across the next few years to see, especially
9392120	9396440	now that we know that, you know, Microsoft, one of the big, you know, PAC men that are
9396440	9402600	eating up all the other companies is kind of saying they're, you know, open to the union
9402600	9406760	thing and, and, you know, going to honor all these agreements that are coming up as a result
9406760	9409720	of, you know, a Bobby Kotick's failures at Activision.
9409720	9414920	So, um, it's going to be, yeah, going to be, um, going to be interesting to see what
9414920	9415880	develops the next few years.
9415960	9418120	I do think that is a trend that's going to continue.
9418120	9422760	I think, and we said that back when these Activision things first happened, this union
9422760	9424680	thing is going to get bigger and bigger.
9424680	9425960	And I, I do think it is.
9426520	9432920	So I, when I, whenever I think of the future, I, I like making my predictions cause I like
9432920	9438200	to have fun with it, but the guarantee of the future is that things are going to expand
9438200	9439640	and things are going to retract.
9440520	9444680	Activision for fuck's sake is no longer its own company.
9444680	9447960	Assuming the deal goes through, Microsoft acquires them, acquires them, so on and so
9447960	9448520	forth.
9448520	9455720	Like to lose somebody that is tenured to, uh, uh, how many years ago is it 40?
9456440	9462600	Uh, like to, to lose a 10 year of a top level player for this long is not unprecedented,
9462600	9464040	but it happens.
9464040	9464280	Yeah.
9464280	9465640	Like what's going to happen.
9465640	9466600	Things are going to change.
9466600	9469320	Going to get bigger, going to get smaller, going to merge, going to split.
9470440	9471960	Ma bells broke up.
9471960	9473960	They they're under all there.
9473960	9475320	They're all under again.
9475320	9481720	It will always be a cycle because then the people that get fed up with the big corporate
9481720	9488120	world, whatever it is, go start their small indie studio and end up making the next Minecraft
9488120	9490920	or five fails in the process of getting to that.
9490920	9491720	Oh, sorry.
9491720	9493000	But then those happen.
9493000	9493240	Yeah.
9493240	9494280	Minecraft happens.
9494280	9495480	Five nights of Freddy's happens.
9497480	9498360	Undertale happens.
9499080	9499640	Yeah.
9499640	9500520	Everything.
9500520	9505800	My, my favorite quote, like the quote that really instilled this in me, secret of mana,
9505800	9509960	SNES time flows like a river and history repeats.
9511400	9512840	I think we'll end on that note.
9512840	9516280	Jason, thank you so much for the insight and thank you for the call tonight.
9516280	9518600	And thanks again for a hit in 20 years with us.
9518600	9519640	Appreciate it.
9519640	9520920	No, another 20 years.
9525160	9525960	See you next week.
9526600	9527800	All right.
9529240	9529740	Okay.
9530440	9534520	We're going to sneak in one more call here, but I do want to try to wrap up the show by
9534520	9535160	nine o'clock.
9535160	9540680	So I'm going to try and I honestly need to go ahead and drop out because people are waiting
9540680	9541400	for me.
9541400	9542120	Oh, okay.
9542680	9544040	Do you have a final thought for us tonight?
9545960	9546600	I like pie.
9547800	9548280	All right.
9548280	9549720	Enjoy stuff and things.
9550760	9551480	Sorry about it.
9551480	9552120	No, you're fine.
9552120	9552520	Take care.
9553320	9554200	Later taters.
9554200	9554600	Bye.
9555240	9555560	Bye.
9556360	9556680	All right.
9556680	9558280	Let me get to another call here.
9558280	9559560	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
9559560	9559960	Who's this?
9563160	9564920	This is why we are.
9564920	9565240	Hi.
9565240	9567000	Are you calling us from a cell connection?
9568600	9572040	No, I'm calling you from the exact same.
9576520	9580360	You're just, you're breaking up really bad for some weird reason.
9580360	9583880	So I'm going to just let, I'm going to try to reconnect.
9583880	9585080	Why don't you do me a favor?
9585080	9588040	Reboot discord and we'll try again real quick.
9588760	9589640	Cool.
9589640	9590040	Cool.
9590040	9590360	All right.
9591960	9593160	We'll just give that a minute there.
9593160	9595240	When I see him pop back in the back robot.
9595240	9599960	Yeah, it sounds like it's like a slow connection or something.
9599960	9601080	That's the weird thing about it.
9601080	9602040	So yeah.
9602040	9603480	And I'm like, why would he change?
9603480	9606920	It's like 1153 at night over there.
9606920	9609320	Why would he leave home anyway?
9609320	9609640	All right.
9609640	9612680	We'll try to bring him back on in a minute here when I see he's back in the green room.
9612680	9613800	Otherwise, let me quickly check in.
9613800	9615640	Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?
9617080	9618120	Not a whole ton.
9618120	9626600	There was some access game announcements at Anime Expo, so they announced seven different games,
9626600	9629720	including inescapable, which is another.
9629720	9631880	It's a game from dream loop games.
9632520	9638600	I guess it's like a social survival game where you're on like a reality television show.
9638600	9639800	So that's kind of interesting.
9640680	9641960	Let me bring back why we are.
9641960	9643240	Let me see if this works now.
9643240	9643800	All right.
9643800	9644280	Take two.
9644280	9645000	Let's try this again.
9645000	9645160	Hi.
9645160	9646040	You're on Orange House radio.
9646040	9649160	Who's this next week?
9649160	9649560	All right.
9649560	9650120	Much better.
9650120	9650360	Hi.
9650360	9650840	How are you?
9651880	9655560	Oh, not so bad now that I'm apparently not a robot.
9655560	9656280	Yeah, that was weird.
9660680	9663880	But at any rate, hi.
9663880	9664600	How's it going?
9664600	9664920	Hi.
9664920	9665320	Good.
9665320	9666200	What's on your mind tonight?
9667240	9670440	Well, actually, this is dating back a few weeks.
9670440	9675800	This is something that I was catching up on some older episodes of the show before the
9675800	9677160	20th anniversary show.
9677160	9681080	But this was obviously not something I was going to bring up last week, even if I had
9681080	9689320	the time, because although it is a bit of a throwback, because I did not expect that
9689320	9694680	you guys would be talking about bar versus no bar in the year 2022.
9697400	9699800	That was about the last thing I expected.
9699800	9704040	But yeah, lo and behold, it was a topic a few weeks back.
9704680	9709960	Actually, it stemmed as a response from, I think, one of the emails that I sent in.
9711480	9717640	So I just wanted to throw in my take on that, because there was a strong opinion,
9718440	9722760	although that was from someone who was no longer connected, unfortunately.
9722760	9728760	But and I'll preface it with everyone should enjoy the game the way that they enjoy most.
9729640	9734600	And remember what I said about the culture issue of West Coast versus East Coast, which
9734600	9740840	I really do think is a bigger part of that than I think we're maybe willing to give credit
9740840	9741160	for.
9741160	9746280	Not to toot my own horn, but I really think the arcade culture of where you learn to play
9746280	9748840	the game factors huge into that.
9749560	9751320	But I do want to hear your take.
9751320	9751820	Go ahead.
9752520	9753240	Sure.
9753240	9760040	So I used to actually be one of those one X, no bar, no items, final destination kind
9760040	9760920	of players.
9760920	9766840	OK, you know, just sorry, just to reset the stage real quick for those in the podcast
9766840	9768520	who maybe don't know what we're talking about.
9768520	9773240	We're talking about a debate in the Dance Dance Revolution scene that goes back 20 years
9773240	9778520	about is it OK to hold that safety bar on the back while you play the game?
9778520	9783480	Or is that no, you're not dancing, you're just whack a mole with your feet.
9783480	9788440	And this endless debate that's been going on here in the year of our Lord 2022.
9790680	9791800	So anyway, sorry, sorry.
9791800	9793320	I just want to refresh people's memory.
9793320	9795320	So please, your take on the issue.
9796440	9799880	Yeah, I was one of those folks that used to feel like the bar is cheating.
9800680	9805320	This was, you know, back in the DDR fifth mix max days.
9805320	9810200	But then I started using the bar when I started playing max 300.
9810200	9816040	And, you know, the difficulty of that song was just so much higher than anything that
9816040	9822920	had come before that it was, you know, it felt like it was something that kind of made
9822920	9829000	it more fair, you know, because just flailing about like that without holding the bar at
9829000	9831160	that speed just seemed a little ridiculous.
9831720	9837960	And then, you know, after a while, especially after In the Groove came out, but even before
9837960	9844200	that, it seemed like everyone pretty much started using it for at least those high level
9844200	9851400	songs, max 300, max unlimited, paranoia survivor and paranoia survivor max, the really hard
9851400	9853880	stuff, the 10 footers, basically.
9853880	9860280	And now the thing is Konami has their ear to the ground.
9860280	9861720	They have their eyes open.
9862520	9869000	When it seemed like everyone had started using the bar for the high level songs, it was not
9869000	9873880	a secret for very long, including to Konami themselves.
9873880	9880120	So if you want my honest opinion, I think this probably happened somewhere around super
9880120	9881240	Nova one or two.
9882280	9891400	But somewhere along the line, they absolutely 100% definitely started factoring the bar
9891400	9895320	in as something that players use.
9895320	9901560	And they take that into account now when they design the highest level charts in the game,
9901560	9905480	your 17s and 18s and 19s and what have you.
9905480	9912440	They're assuming that if you are going to play max 360 challenge with its 1000 notes,
9913160	9916840	they are assuming that you are going to be holding the bar for dear life.
9917560	9927000	So I think it is now at the point, I mean, you know, the 13s and under that kind of thing,
9927000	9928440	that's its own thing.
9928520	9936840	But if you choose to play a high level song like 17 and up, and you choose not to hold
9936840	9942120	the bar, you are not declining a potentially unfair advantage.
9943000	9950200	Rather, you are choosing a handicap that makes the game harder than the game designers intended,
9950200	9954200	because they factored that in when they designed the chart.
9955160	9959960	I just want to make sure my viewpoint on bar versus no bar is known in this situation here
9959960	9961160	in the year 2022.
9961160	9966840	My current viewpoint on the bar versus no bar is I don't give a fuck how you play the
9966840	9974040	game, because honestly, when I look at those 16 and 17 footers, that is all ludicrous shit
9974040	9974520	anyway.
9974520	9978200	And I have a heart attack just reading those fucking charts.
9978200	9979080	So you know what?
9979080	9982280	If you need the bar bar, I don't said the part.
9982280	9987080	If you need the bar to move your feet that fast, go off, sis.
9987080	9988600	I don't give a fuck.
9988600	9993400	I'm 44 and cannot be bothered to have an opinion about your.
9993400	9996760	But just just, you know, I hope you wipe down the bar between games.
9996760	9998840	That's all people.
9998840	10000920	People put their babies up there to change the diaper.
10000920	10001720	We've seen that.
10002600	10003480	Excuse me?
10003480	10004600	No, no, no.
10004600	10006600	That was a keyboard mania machine back in the day.
10006600	10008200	I was a keyboard mania machine back in the day.
10008760	10009880	That's hilarious.
10011640	10013320	You use what you have to use, I guess.
10014840	10019480	Or you can go with Jason and Chad, who says, fuck DDR, play, dance, rush and groove.
10019480	10022360	Yeah, that could have been my other witty answer, as I could have said.
10022360	10022840	You know what?
10022840	10024120	Can't we just agree?
10024120	10028520	DDR is over anyway, but it's not.
10028520	10031320	DDR just came out.
10031320	10031800	I know.
10031800	10033240	I knew that would ruffle your feathers.
10034280	10034760	All right.
10034760	10036760	Why are I got to wrap up so we can end the show?
10036760	10038760	Quick, quick last thought here, and then we'll let you go.
10041560	10048680	OK, I have completed finally after over a year working on the mini games for super duper
10048680	10049480	multitasking.
10049480	10054360	I've moved on to the mission mode, so please continue to look forward to that.
10055480	10056520	See you next patch.
10058360	10059320	See you next week.
10060760	10061080	All right.
10061080	10062440	Why are take care of my friend.
10063400	10064120	See you later.
10064120	10064360	All right.
10064360	10064680	Bye.
10064760	10065260	Bye.
10066600	10069880	Now it's going to take everything to like not do that to callers.
10069880	10070760	See you next week.
10071960	10075080	I have some, but I don't want to give Jason a complex either because it's iconic.
10075080	10076360	We all love his outro.
10076360	10078520	So all right.
10080840	10081800	I think that's about it.
10081800	10084200	Do you have any other last minute stories you want to squeeze in there before we sign
10084200	10084700	off?
10085000	10086520	Yeah, as I was mentioning.
10086520	10090840	So Access Games announced seven games at Anime Expo.
10090840	10093160	So Inescapable is one of those.
10093560	10098440	A lot of these I don't recognize because they look to be very Japanese.
10098440	10102440	So Shu and No, Verce, Error, Salvation.
10103160	10104280	Maybe that's Versa.
10104280	10105240	I don't know how you spell that.
10106680	10107880	So there's that.
10107880	10111080	And then we've got Spirit Hunter Death Mark 2.
10113000	10116280	Nord 9 Varkommen's and Nord 9 Last Era.
10117560	10120840	Radiant Tail and Pups and Purrs Pet Shop.
10120840	10123320	That's on the Switch, obviously.
10124440	10124940	All right.
10126680	10127160	All right.

10176360	10177800	So, Loki, it's over to you.
10177800	10178680	Your final thoughts tonight?
10179400	10179960	I'm tired.
10181800	10183160	All right, well, feel better.
10184120	10187480	My final thought is I'm glad that I have tomorrow off.
10187480	10191320	I mean, I could give a shit about the holiday this year, but I'm just glad I have another
10191320	10192920	day to sleep in because I need it.
10192920	10193560	I really do.
10194200	10198120	For those that do remember Hoard House and Grandpa, I will just let you know Friday night
10198120	10201080	we were hanging out and I was drinking with him.
10202280	10205560	And you can imagine how that went trying to keep up with drinking with Grandpa.
10205560	10208920	So I'm thankful to have another day to sleep in tomorrow.
10208920	10209560	That's for sure.
10210440	10211400	Have a good week, everybody.
