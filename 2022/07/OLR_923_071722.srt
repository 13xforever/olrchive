00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Twitch is currently testing a feature that could allow any streamer, or at least more

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,360
of them, to centrally collect donations that are sent directly to a charity of that streamer's

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,760
choosing instead of pooling donations into a streamer's personal control and taking

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,700
their word that they're doing the right thing.

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,280
With mass appeal and application also comes more opportunities for mass or targeted scamming.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,640
This episode is not raising funds for charity.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,640
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, to tell you more

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,440
about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,200
where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,960
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,040
where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:55,220
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 923 of our

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,560
show for tonight, July the 24th of 2022.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,360
After being unexpectedly off last week, I had COVID.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
It's just that simple.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,340
I tested positive Sunday morning, and it was the faintest of faint line.

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,420
In fact, it was that whole thing where I sent it to a friend, and my friend was like, oh,

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,880
I've done this with pregnancy tests.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,180
You play with the contrast and the lighting, and you can see when you do that that there's

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,180
a line there.

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,300
And I was like, great.

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,380
The exhaustion really started to take its toll, and yep, so whomp, whomp.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,760
It finally got me after two and a half years, but I'm feeling marginally better as of yesterday,

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,860
so I am back.

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,620
So I'm happy to be back, and I'm back with my co-host.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,220
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

27
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,220
Hi.

28
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,180
Hi, how are you?

29
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,820
I may have a sinus infection.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,420
Well, that sucks.

31
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,180
Those aren't contagious.

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,800
No, they're not contagious.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
That's the good thing.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,800
We have a lot of activity at my house.

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Well, you know we're converting our garage.

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,600
Yeah, because you got the car that was in there.

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,720
You had a classic car in there, and you got that out because you're going to allow that

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,800
to be the second half of your pinball expansion now, right?

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Well, no.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
It is where all the pinballs have been moved to, all but three, so everything's outside.

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,120
Dan got black and gray carpet tiles that honestly aren't that great, but they look good, and

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,800
made the Space Invader on our floor.

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Oh, that's clever.

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Okay.

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,800
And the walls are black with blue LED strips going around the room, and he's mounted a

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,920
TV, and we've got all the rest of the pins out there, of course, except for Black Knight,

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,920
World Cup, and Theater of Magic, and we have a living room again.

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
And we have couch and chairs that we got at La-Z-Boy.

49
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Yeah.

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,040
If you all had seen JV's house before, there was pinball machines out back, there was pinball

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,040
machines in a secondary bedroom, there was pinball machines in the living room.

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Air pin, air pin, everywhere a pinball.

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:05,040
But it was like any gamer nerd, even if you're only just a casual pinball enjoyer, you'd

54
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
be like, wow, this is rad.

55
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,040
And I've invented a new term, dust kittens.

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Oh, is that what was growing behind your pinball tables?

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,160
It's what happens when you have a cat and dust.

58
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
Oh, yeah.

59
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
You don't have dust bunnies, you have dust kittens.

60
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160
No, that was living in my old computer for sure.

62
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
I swept up another cat.

63
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Oh, my gosh.

64
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:34,160
So that's what's been going on in my house, and now we can actually sit on a couch and

65
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,160
watch a TV and play a game or thing.

66
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Nice.

67
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Nice.

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Yeah.

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
All right.

70
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Well, also-

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
I feel like an adult again.

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Hey.

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Hello.

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Hi.

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
I hope you enjoyed the spontaneous week off.

76
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Sure.

77
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Were you able to get in more Minecraft?

78
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Because I saw you pushed a Minecraft video this week.

79
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,280
So I was like, oh, maybe Loki had time to edit another video.

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Well, no, I did that this week.

81
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Yeah, but yeah, not last weekend.

82
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Last weekend was probably just messing around with something.

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
I don't remember.

84
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Gotcha.

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,660
I see tonight, I was going to add, because we do tape live at twitch.tv slash a vog network

86
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,480
every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby

87
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,180
Black Wolf show, which by the way, happy birthday, Bobby Black Wolf, a young 17 years old.

88
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,500
The show, not the host.

89
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,880
The show is 17 years old as of tonight.

90
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,340
As I tell Bobby every year, happy birthday.

91
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,340
Always a pleasure-

92
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,340
He was try 29.

93
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,340
Yes.

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,400
We're going to be on stage with you on Sunday nights, but respect your elders.

95
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:49,160
All right, but so of course, as we do tape live on Twitch, I'm sorry the podcast feed

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,120
can't see our lovely faces, but you can see if you subscribe over a vog network with like

97
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,080
your free Amazon prime subscription or whatever, you can access the video archives and watch

98
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
whatever episodes you want.

99
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,080
But the Loki always has a video of a game playing behind him.

100
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,500
And tonight I recognize this one as a game everyone's talking about this week.

101
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,940
This is stray, is it not?

102
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,380
Or is it some predecessor game?

103
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,220
I occasionally like to showcase games that I've purchased and yet will have no time to

104
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220
play.

105
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:25,100
So this is my latest purchase that I will not have time to play.

106
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,100
Eventually we'll get there.

107
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Okay.

108
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
That sounds good.

109
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,500
But yeah, it's a very popular and streaming right now.

110
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,520
A lot of my favorite Dead by Daylight streamers have taken a...

111
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,000
It's interesting because now they're getting sidetracked with all these other games.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Some of them are playing a Video Horror Society, which was called VHS for short.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,520
I don't know why they...

114
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,080
Actually because VHS has already been taken by another game.

115
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,280
Oh, I didn't know that.

116
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
Okay.

117
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
They put that up on their Twitter.

118
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Oh, I didn't know that.

119
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
All right.

120
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,880
So now they have Video Horror Society, which obviously everybody's still calling it VHS

121
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
for short.

122
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Yeah.

123
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
I see that one a lot.

124
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,220
There was another scary game that came out recently that everybody was doing for a hot

125
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,540
minute and now Stray.

126
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,980
Now they're all doing Stray.

127
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,540
So everyone was doing Elden Ring for a minute and then everyone was doing The Quarry.

128
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,540
The Quarry.

129
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,540
Yeah.

130
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,540
Of course.

131
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,540
That's the horror game I was trying to think of.

132
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
Everybody did The Quarry for a week.

133
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,540
It was great.

134
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,540
Yeah.

135
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,540
Yeah.

136
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,540
So now it's Stray, but Stray looks really fun.

137
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,180
I don't know how I feel about the stealth mechanics, but the physics and the way that

138
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,280
they've done the cat and everything is really, it's really adorable.

139
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
I want to pick it up.

140
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,180
I'm just not sure if I should get it on PlayStation or if I should get it on PC because you've

141
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,180
seen these mods.

142
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
It runs better on PlayStation.

143
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
Oh, okay.

144
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Okay.

145
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,320
But you've seen the mods on PC, right?

146
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,360
People were posting about that to our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

147
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,960
People will post inspirational topics for the night.

148
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,920
And somebody was asking, when are we going to get a Mr. Smoosh mod?

149
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,960
Well, number one, I don't do 3D graphics, that fancy stuff.

150
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,780
Nobody has to do it for me, but I wouldn't complain if someone did.

151
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,780
But don't forget Cheddar.

152
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,880
Can we have an AB switch or something?

153
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,700
And while you're at it, you might as well do Minda and our classic OLR cats of the past

154
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,700
too.

155
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,020
So, you know, Sanrio.

156
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,460
You just need to put Shermie in a wheelbarrow.

157
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,460
Yeah.

158
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,460
So might as well get them all.

159
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,020
Shermie was not agile in her later years.

160
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,060
How long until we get someone modding a dog in instead?

161
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,060
That's blasphemy.

162
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,600
I'm literally hearing Cheddar in here, like as I'm talking about him, but I'm looking

163
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,960
behind me and I don't see him.

164
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
I'm like, what in the world?

165
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,080
Like, did Loki turn the volume up on that video somehow?

166
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
What is that?

167
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
No.

168
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
It's cats in the wall.

169
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
Yeah, I guess so.

170
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
My gosh.

171
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
He's found his way into the wall.

172
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,440
Well, it's not uncommon for him to yell, yell loudly in Alan's office, which is on the other

173
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
side of the wall.

174
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,400
But anyway, let's talk a little bit about our kickoff topic tonight, which really, in

175
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,100
kind of looking through the news, I didn't see any stories that were gigantic stories.

176
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,820
So I thought we could start tonight by kind of recapping some of the news from last week,

177
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,660
because there was quite a bit of news last week.

178
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,860
By the way, hello to our live Twitch chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

179
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,260
Mike Defton chat talking about me being out with COVID saying, yeah, it eventually caught

180
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,500
up to all of us.

181
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,900
Not everyone's had it yet, but it's making the rounds.

182
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,980
But good thing that vaccines are a thing.

183
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,080
Yeah, obviously I had the double vaccine, the single boost.

184
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,800
I didn't qualify for the double boost.

185
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,480
I probably should have just got it anyway, but I'm trying to be a good boy and look how

186
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
that treated me.

187
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Yeah.

188
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,720
My wife keeps bugging me about that.

189
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,220
But my booster was all the way back in November, right?

190
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,780
But anyway, honestly, I thought it was going to be a lot worse than it was, but it hits

191
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,560
and I'm not trying to belittle it.

192
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,040
I'm just saying probably because of vaccines and the fact that because I've made it no

193
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,380
secret on this show, I have diabetes.

194
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,700
So because of that, I qualified for Paxlevid, even though I'm in my forties and not over

195
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,420
65.

196
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,320
We all know President Biden got COVID as well, and he went on Paxlevid because of his age.

197
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,060
So I qualified for Paxlevid because of diabetes.

198
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,980
And I think that was probably part of what was holding off my symptoms because the treatment

199
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,060
cycle finished.

200
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,620
So you're on Paxlevid for five days.

201
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,320
That finished yesterday morning was my last dose.

202
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,120
Now tonight, I'm starting to feel a little bit of congestion again.

203
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,580
Like I'm going to try to push through best I can, but if I call it, you'll all know why.

204
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,360
But I feel like this could have been a lot worse.

205
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,280
Well, when I had swine flu years ago, and that was far worse, but I didn't have a vaccine

206
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
for swine flu.

207
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:45,860
So anyway, Dijarama says, did you drink any Pedialyte as well?

208
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,020
Gatorade zero and vitamin water, like similar stuff.

209
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,260
So I have to make sure it's not too sugary because I can't drink regular Gatorade, but

210
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,460
I can drink Gatorade zero.

211
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,020
So I will do that.

212
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,520
So let's see.

213
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,900
Also some folks talking about Stray but with a dog.

214
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,620
Tiger class says, well, if they could, if they want to make a sequel with a dog, dog

215
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,420
gameplay would be more frantic though.

216
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:16,040
I guess they've already put CJ from Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas in it, so we've anything's

217
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
possible now.

218
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,400
Gosh, I saw you just linked that in our chat room.

219
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
That's funny.

220
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Yeah.

221
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,600
Mike Deaf says, I'm glad it was pretty much like a cold when I went through it.

222
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Yeah.

223
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
For me, it was fatigue.

224
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Like I did not.

225
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,320
It was interesting because people were giving me advice on, oh yeah, you get a sore throat

226
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,800
and this, you know, make sure you have lozenges.

227
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,520
I never had really a sore throat.

228
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,100
I had a throat tickle, but not a sore throat.

229
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,520
fatigue was the huge thing.

230
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,440
Like I felt like I permanently had taken a Tylenol PM.

231
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,320
And just even the point where like holding up my phone to text people, like my arms would

232
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,280
get sore and I'd be like, I just want to put them down on the bed and go back to sleep.

233
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,580
So that's what it was for me.

234
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,580
It's horrible.

235
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,880
That mod not only changes the model to make the cat look like CJ, but it makes all the

236
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,320
cats like human, like someone stretched a cat skin onto a person.

237
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,380
It's just so wrong.

238
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,020
That's a little creepy.

239
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,060
All right.

240
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,420
I thought for our kickoff topic tonight, we could recap some of the news from last week

241
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,260
and some of the big headlines that we missed because we were unexpectedly off.

242
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,640
We'd originally planned to do a show, but it didn't happen.

243
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,780
So some of the big headlines from last week, Bayonetta 3 finally got a launch date and

244
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,620
it is this year, which is pretty exciting.

245
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,520
It's going to be launching on October 28th, which is a little sooner, I think maybe than

246
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,800
some folks had anticipated.

247
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,400
Y'all excited about Bayonetta 3 coming out in October, just in time for Halloween?

248
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,140
If it's even more over the top, yes.

249
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Let's hope.

250
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,140
Let's hope.

251
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,240
I wonder if this isn't going to be the last one.

252
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,140
I think the Bayonetta games are great.

253
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,800
I hope it's not the last one, but a lot of things run in trilogies, right?

254
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,140
It very well could be the last one.

255
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
So we'll see.

256
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,140
We'll see.

257
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,100
It took them a while to make this one too.

258
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,420
They're going to be putting out a physical Switch edition of Bayonetta 1, sort of to

259
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,180
couple with that.

260
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,180
There was a digital version of Bayonetta 1 already available if you bought Bayonetta

261
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,140
2, but you would have Bayonetta 2 on the cart and the Bayonetta 1 digital.

262
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:23,460
So a physical Switch edition for the collectors is coming later this year, but it's currently

263
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
undated.

264
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,860
A new multiplayer Kirby game was announced.

265
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,380
Kirby's Dream Buffet is coming out.

266
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,980
So that's kind of neat.

267
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,580
You mean like every dream I ever have?

268
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,140
Yeah, it's a Kirby Dream Buffet.

269
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:44,660
If I were Kirby Dark Sakura and I inhaled your dream, what power would I get?

270
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,940
You don't want to know.

271
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,620
You do not want to know, especially with the weird-ass nightmares I've been having lately.

272
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,940
So anyway, it's food-based obstacle courses.

273
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,660
You collect strawberries as Kirby grows, and then you fight on a floating platform.

274
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,260
It seems a little fall guys to me maybe, like just a little, but it seems like maybe a little

275
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,460
bit fall guys to me.

276
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:15,540
But yeah, I'm sure especially Mike Deft is going to be excited to hear that there's another

277
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Kirby game.

278
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,420
So there you go.

279
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:23,500
Mike Deft in chat says, fuck the haters who say it's too soon for another Kirby game.

280
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,980
You know what?

281
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,980
How about Mario?

282
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,300
Like there's always going to be side adventures and things like that.

283
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,580
Kirby's just one of the Nintendo mascots now.

284
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,300
So there is that.

285
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,700
An article was also going around that Nintendo Japan does recognize the same-sex marriages

286
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,100
of their employees despite Japanese law.

287
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,900
So just a lot of people tipping their hat and saying kudos to Nintendo Japan for recognizing

288
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
that.

289
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,580
Again, this is all the news from last week that we weren't able to get to while we were

290
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,140
out.

291
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,820
One that had people talking quite a bit, especially in our discord, there was a lot of chat about

292
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:02,540
this, and that was the fact that Nintendo acquired a CG animation studio, Dynamo Pictures,

293
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,980
and they're going to be rebranding themselves as Nintendo Pictures.

294
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,920
This deal will be finalized on October 3rd, and then Dynamo Pictures in Nintendo's statement

295
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,700
will be, quote, focused on development of visual content utilizing Nintendo IP.

296
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,080
Now this has a lot of people kind of going, oh, well, is this because they're making a

297
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,920
Mario movie with, I think it's what Imagination, the people that do the Minion movies, or making

298
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,300
the Mario movie, and Nintendo wants to branch out and do their own movies and more.

299
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,720
I don't think it's really that, because if you look at Dynamo Pictures' resume, they've

300
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:47,760
already worked on some things, such as Pikmin short movies, Metroid Other M post production,

301
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,080
Monster Hunter World motion capture, and they actually did work on Death Stranding, which

302
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,560
isn't Nintendo, and so on and so on.

303
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,280
They're not really in the business of making feature length films, and there is quite a

304
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
difference.

305
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:08,600
However, I think this probably lends itself to that there is probably some games that

306
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,160
Nintendo is working on for the Switch that we don't know about yet, where they want to

307
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:20,600
do some epic cut scenes, and perhaps that is a Mario game, perhaps, but this could be

308
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
something else as well.

309
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Or a Zelda game.

310
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,900
It very well could be a Zelda game, but they're already doing it for a Metroid game, maybe

311
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
another Metroid.

312
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,380
We know Metroid Prime 4 is a thing, right?

313
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,000
Maybe they are being contracted to work on some more cut scenes for that.

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,780
So I kind of think it's for more in-house development for the games, and I wouldn't

315
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,240
forecast that suddenly Nintendo wants to get into movies.

316
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,880
I'm pretty sure their agreement, whatever they have with Illumination, probably would

317
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,000
get in the way of that anyway, but I mean, never say never.

318
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,960
They could always expand and hire more people and do new things, but I think whatever they

319
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,960
do is probably going to be limited to Nintendo's platform.

320
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,120
You know what they could do?

321
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,520
If you want to hear my tinfoil hat theory, and who doesn't love to hear a Rob Roberts

322
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,640
tinfoil hat theory?

323
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,600
You already?

324
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,780
What they could do is maybe try to create some short movie content, and I mean shorts,

325
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:25,040
and I mean think about on the 3DS system when you could download countless episodes of Dinosaur

326
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,640
Office on the 3DS shop.

327
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,120
But what if there were maybe short movies, I'm not talking about Dinosaur Office, but

328
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,520
maybe something with like Pikmin, I don't know, or one of the other cute Nintendo franchises

329
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,840
where they could give away episodes on Nintendo Switch online with expansion pack, and maybe

330
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:49,740
creating kid-friendly programming like Nintendo flicks, basically.

331
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,840
Not something, and I don't want you guys to think big picture with that, I'm not saying

332
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,120
Nintendo's going to launch a Netflix competitor, but I'm saying what if kind of in their own

333
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,440
little bubble, just their own little short amount of trickled content?

334
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,580
That I think would be the tinfoil idea for me, is not a feature length movie, but maybe

335
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:15,320
creating a variety of shorts for distribution on Nintendo's platform.

336
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,600
And Tiger Claw on chat says they've done that before, remember the animated short for

337
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,200
Star Fox Zero?

338
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Yes, so I could see something like that being a thing.

339
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,240
So don't think Nintendo Movie, because they've got the partnership with Illumination for

340
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
that.

341
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,120
And if it's, you know, if many people are reading into the fact that the Mario movie

342
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,880
is simply seeding a Donkey Kong movie and a Nintendo multiverse at some point, based

343
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,680
on what's happening at the theme parks, you can bet that Illumination is probably doing

344
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,760
the Donkey Kong movie as well.

345
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,720
So this is going to be for something different.

346
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,600
It's probably for the games, but it could be like, not even the Switch, I would say

347
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,280
the Switch's successor, and building up some type of library of content for that.

348
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,680
Or what about their theme park or something like that?

349
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,280
They could be doing animation for a ride or something.

350
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Again, I feel like since Universal licensed it from Nintendo, Universal would ultimately

351
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,480
be responsible for that and they would probably leverage Illumination to do it.

352
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
I don't know.

353
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,240
We'll just see what they do and then be disappointed by it.

354
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Sounds good.

355
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
All right.

356
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,920
Let's just think about what was the key thing in animation 10 years ago?

357
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,160
And then that's probably what they're doing.

358
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
VR.

359
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Oh, they're getting the VR.

360
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
There we go.

361
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Yeah.

362
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
There we go.

363
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
VR.

364
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
3D movies.

365
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Or 3D TVs.

366
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Yes, 3D movies.

367
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
3D movies and 3D TVs.

368
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
That's what it is.

369
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:43,040
Although, to be fair, Loki, Nintendo actually was on the edge of that because of the 3DS.

370
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Yes, yes, yes.

371
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Until they stopped.

372
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,880
Until those movie carts never came out.

373
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,400
Remember when we saw Tron Legacy on a Nintendo 3DS and then it never actually came out?

374
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,720
Yeah, they didn't have very many movies.

375
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,440
The only one I remember was the Tekken animated movie was in 3D.

376
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
Yeah.

377
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,040
I remember when they were showing off major motion pictures on those cartridges and for

378
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,520
whatever reason it-

379
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:16,400
It was up there with, what was it, the UH, not UHD, it was, oh gosh, I don't remember-

380
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
HD DVD?

381
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Is that what you're thinking of?

382
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
No, no, no, no, no.

383
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Oh, no, no.

384
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
No, you're thinking too big.

385
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,000
God, I don't remember what Sony used to call their stupid PSP discs.

386
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,320
The UMDs, says Pod Culture in chat.

387
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
UMDs, thank you.

388
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
Yes.

389
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
UMDs.

390
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Yeah.

391
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,200
It was on the cusp of the UMDs, you know, they were going to tackle that market like

392
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,160
they did with Game Boy video or Game Boy Advance video.

393
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Hey, Game Boy Advance-

394
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Actually, those are really popular.

395
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,200
I was going to say, you joke, but you could get a Pokemon episode or two or a Nickelodeon

396
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,640
cartoon crammed into a Game Boy cart and you could shut your kid up for a ride to the grocery

397
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,400
store, so it's something.

398
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,040
All right.

399
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
That's so funny.

400
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,160
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I still have the Green Lantern trailer in 3D on my 3DS.

401
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,280
I wonder, what are y'all holding on to on your DS that you're never going to delete?

402
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I'm so curious.

403
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Anyway-

404
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,760
Actually, I think I gave my old DS to Julian.

405
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:25,120
If my battery hadn't died, I'd probably still have the Meteos E3 demo on my DS.

406
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,420
All right, anyway, moving on to some other headlines we missed last week.

407
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,600
PlayStation is going to be launching a loyalty program.

408
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,880
It's called PlayStation Stars, and you will get rewards by doing different things within

409
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
PlayStation.

410
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,480
It really sounds like a version of Microsoft Points, which Microsoft's been leveraging

411
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,940
for some time, but PlayStation will be doing this with their own system, and maybe if you

412
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,200
are the first person to unlock a platinum trophy, you might get some extra stars for

413
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
that.

414
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,120
You get some loyalty points, which we'll redeem in a catalog, and again, you might be able

415
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,640
to actually just fund your PlayStation Plus account with that, so it might be a good way

416
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,580
to kind of help pay for itself.

417
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,880
There were some early rumors that this was going to be NFTs, and in an interview with

418
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,840
the Washington Post, Sony Interactive Entertainment advertising VP Grace Chen went on record and

419
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,200
said, it's definitely not NFTs.

420
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Definitely not.

421
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,960
You can't trade them or sell them.

422
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,560
It's not leveraging any blockchain technologies.

423
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Not NFTs.

424
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,840
Very, very, very clear, very explicit statement from Sony on that, but I don't know who thought

425
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
that was NFTs.

426
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,520
It just, again, it just sounds like Microsoft's program, but remodeled for Sony.

427
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,160
Anyway, this was what I was really hoping to talk to Dark Soccer about last week until

428
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,720
COVID got me.

429
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,680
There is a Genesis Mini 2 that has been confirmed for release in the US on October 27th, and

430
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,680
they've got some bangers in here.

431
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,440
They've got Mega CD this time, including Final Fight CD, Lunar, Eternal Blue, and Lunar the

432
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,460
Silver Star.

433
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:16,900
They've got Alien Soldier, Spatter, Tatsujin, Super Street Fighter II, the new challengers.

434
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,320
This is a very neat little console, and I was thinking about it.

435
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,680
And of course, I was like, well, Dark Soccer is probably going to be like, I already have

436
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,760
all of these.

437
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
But then-

438
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
I do have most of them.

439
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
I'll be honest.

440
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,760
But still, the charm is going to be hard to resist.

441
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:37,280
No, no, no, no, I, Dan and I did get the other one.

442
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,720
So this one could also happen.

443
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
We'll see.

444
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Yeah.

445
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Yeah.

446
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,240
Many folks in chat speaking up on that one, Dark2CSA and Sega CD stuff, Digirama S says

447
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,520
Lunar alone is worth the price, and SHO 100 Matt says, oh, yes, the Genesis Mini 2 is

448
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,200
going to be day one for many of us here.

449
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Yes, yes.

450
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,840
Oh, by the way, speaking of 3DS titles, you're never going to delete a great answer from

451
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,800
our voiceover man, the VX Jason XV, who says, I'm holding on to Theatrhythm because it's

452
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
fun.

453
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Curtain call, naturally.

454
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
So much better than the original.

455
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Yes, yes.

456
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,400
Well, hold that thought because we have another kind of related-ish story a little later in

457
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
the show.

458
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,720
Just hold that thought.

459
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,680
Anyway, some other news from last week.

460
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Let's see.

461
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,440
Oh, this is not good.

462
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,480
Data leaked out of Bandai Namco because there was a ransomware attack with that.

463
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Whoops.

464
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,840
Konami, though, apparently going to be relisting Metal Gear titles that had previously delisted.

465
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,040
Did you all remember that Metal Gear titles got delisted?

466
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Yeah.

467
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,100
I think most people forgot, but I do remember when it happened.

468
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,000
And then in the Arcade Archive series, Dragon Saber came out from Namco.

469
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,280
So that came out as well.

470
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,560
And then a game that Loki has talked about on this show previously, Fashion Police Squad

471
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,760
gets its official release August 15th on the PC, but later on consoles.

472
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,600
Hey, it looked kind of fun.

473
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,480
I was very curious about that one.

474
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
So I wanted to try that.

475
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,320
There's a demo if you want to check it out.

476
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,800
Oh, that's great.

477
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,040
Bobby in chat says, that was the Metal Gear delisting due to the archive historical footage.

478
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,760
Yes, that was.

479
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,560
It really was like a year ago at this point.

480
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
It really feels like.

481
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,440
So it's interesting that now you're coming back.

482
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
All right.

483
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,640
Loki, did you see anything you wanted to touch on that I missed for Dark Soccer?

484
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,280
I don't remember if it was last week or whatever, but Ubisoft delisting a bunch of their titles

485
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,240
that they're still selling for like they were like this was during the steam sale.

486
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,760
They were like selling a bunch of their Assassin's Creed Far Cry three.

487
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
That was all that stuff was.

488
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,140
Yeah, that was being delisted off of there.

489
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:45,300
So basically that you wouldn't be able to if you bought the game, you can't download

490
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,300
it again and you can't access the DLC, which is weird, really irritating.

491
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,940
And a lot of these games are single player games.

492
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,740
And the fact that you can't get the DLC for it and stuff, it's just really annoying.

493
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:06,300
So yeah, yeah, yeah, I definitely saw the social media updates on all that last week.

494
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:12,460
I don't understand why they couldn't just like, you know, just put it out for free.

495
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,020
Like you're you're delisting them anyways, just say, OK, for this like few weeks, we're

496
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,860
going to make it free like those games.

497
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,820
They're super old anyways, like just offer that all for free so everybody can download

498
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,100
it and then you'd get a bunch of goodwill.

499
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,460
And then people would, you know, they remember like, oh, hey, thank you for all those free

500
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,520
games, Ubisoft.

501
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,840
Have you addressed these, you know, sexual misconduct of your employees at your company?

502
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,480
And they'd say, no, of course not.

503
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,680
Why would we have done that?

504
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,400
Have you held the East Kuma accountable yet for anything?

505
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,160
Exactly. So, you know, we will when the other company is.

506
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,720
Yeah.

507
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,840
Dartusia says, I know they've given away AC games before.

508
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,280
So, yeah, I guess speaking of giving away games, I don't think it's on our showreel

509
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,320
tonight, but did you see like Anthem, a GameStop you can get for a penny now?

510
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,000
But yeah, you can get Anthem, a GameStop for a penny now.

511
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,840
I mean, they've given away this game so many different ways, like it's on game.

512
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,960
But it was free to play.

513
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,840
It's not free to play.

514
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,840
I think you could get a retail version of it, though, for a penny if you want.

515
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,880
So it's yeah, the glory days of Anthem never happened.

516
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,320
Anyway, pretty much.

517
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,120
And how many of us were like, how many of us told them so?

518
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,480
Yeah, I know. I was thinking I'm sorry.

519
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,240
Well, for some reason, I was thinking Anthem, I was thinking the

520
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,320
there's the other game, not Anthem.

521
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,120
Gosh, I can see the game, but I can't think of the game.

522
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,400
And it's not Destiny.

523
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,480
No, the one, the one by the the one by the Titanfall devs, I can't remember.

524
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,640
It's Apex Legends.

525
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,960
I was thinking Apex one when you said Anthem, you know, both start with an A.

526
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,080
So yeah, Apex really essentially the same.

527
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,120
No, no. Oh yeah.

528
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,200
And Anthem, yeah, Anthem for a penny.

529
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,080
And no, my dev says if it comes with a box,

530
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,560
that's a good way to get replacement cases for other better games.

531
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,240
That is true. A good tip.

532
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,200
What's it? What's what's the trade in value on that?

533
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,760
Like, comment, subscribe for more tips. All right.

534
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,480
What can I trade that in for it at GameStop?

535
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,880
I bet it's probably only a penny if it's if it's the one

536
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,040
that's just the game in the little paper envelope.

537
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,080
I bet if they actually have a box, it's probably ninety nine cents.

538
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,200
All right. Let's talk about what games we have been playing this week

539
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,520
that probably aren't Anthem.

540
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Let's talk about some other games we've been playing this week

541
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,440
in a segment we call Appropriately.

542
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,800
How was your gaming week?

543
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,960
Dark Soccer, we'll start with you.

544
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,840
How was your gaming week?

545
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,880
I have played Final Fantasy six.

546
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,280
And well, I'm still playing Survivor.

547
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,760
I don't think I've seen you play killer in a week.

548
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,440
I was really in and out of it this week, so I played killer

549
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,080
a week and a half ago, and it ended up being like an LOL game

550
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,440
because I was just trying to get a doctor achievement done.

551
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,960
And I made friends again.

552
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,640
That's cool. But I don't know what it is, but like

553
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,760
I can have full and as a survivor thing, I don't know what it is.

554
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,600
Maybe it's the fact that I've played all killer for so long. But.

555
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,760
Even if I can't make friends with the killer,

556
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,200
you know, like in game,

557
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,640
I can at least have a moment of communication with them

558
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,840
and see if they will try to be friends.

559
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,280
You know what I mean? So.

560
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,800
It's just it's silly.

561
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,880
It's all silliness.

562
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,120
But I've been enjoying myself and Finara has been

563
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,880
not only my my meat shield,

564
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,040
but also now my accountant.

565
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,240
Because she's keeping track of my my

566
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,840
what's it called the the tome stuff achievements.

567
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,800
And and. And I've really appreciated that,

568
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,400
although I'm stadia hunters is kind of weird for

569
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,360
because that's where stadia achievements go.

570
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,880
And I need to just find like a straight up list that I can put

571
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,400
on the spreadsheet myself so that it's easier for me to track.

572
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,920
But I did make a couple of accomplishments.

573
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,640
I have adapted every survivor that is adaptable,

574
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,040
including freaking Ash. Wow.

575
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,720
Oh, the David one was given to me.

576
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,320
The Laurie one was given to me.

577
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,440
I'm like, bless you.

578
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,720
Just like the nurse one was back in the day. Lucky.

579
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,120
And so, you know, there's like the special generators, right?

580
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,960
Like the one in the

581
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,680
asylum and the one in the church and freaking ring light.

582
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,640
But I've gotten now all of the special generators done.

583
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,080
Nice. That's great.

584
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,040
Yeah, you can you can.

585
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,760
It's probably the exact same list of steam's achievements.

586
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,520
So if you need a table steam has that, this doesn't. Oh, interesting.

587
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah. Is it related to the Stranger Things content?

588
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,640
Because some of them change. Not at all. Oh, weird. OK.

589
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,040
I mean, it would be possible because I mean, for anyone

590
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,600
who got the Stranger Things achievements, they're off your list on steam.

591
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,720
Interesting. And they're completely gone from from stadia hunters,

592
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,880
which is basically where stadia outputs all of their achievement stuff to.

593
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,760
But I have one hundred and fifty one out of a hold on.

594
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,120
I've got the number right here.

595
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,600
I have one hundred and fifty one out of one hundred and ninety six.

596
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,920
Wow. And as of now, I've played for seven hundred

597
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,240
and seventeen hours and fifteen. Wow.

598
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,480
Yeah, press still significantly longer than other people, but I've

599
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,640
well, I'm maybe three and a shorter than a lot of my friends.

600
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,120
Yeah, that way.

601
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,160
But on the plus side,

602
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,040
it is. Yeah, and like Mike says, I now can play both.

603
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,200
But I think that I'm actually a pretty decent Nia player now.

604
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,800
And the one thing that restricts me is that my mouse,

605
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,760
I have to use a thumb track ball, so I can't look behind me.

606
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,560
And I don't like to use a controller because it hurts my wrist after a while.

607
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,680
But I have found that every so often, all I have to do is just do that number,

608
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,520
spin the ball, and I'll do a perfect 360 on somebody.

609
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,480
That's funny.

610
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,640
Did you and I was to say, Deidre, I mess and chat says,

611
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,320
sounds like Jamie logged more hours in DVD than your average persona five player.

612
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,800
Yes, I know people over 3000 hours.

613
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,400
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

614
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,680
Easily, easily.

615
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,480
I've been playing for like a year, a little over a year.

616
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,080
I know people who play since the game freaking came out and played it religiously.

617
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,440
Yeah. Anything else for a game a week?

618
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,240
Um, I played my word game.

619
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,840
And, oh, I played like this woodblock puzzle game that I used to play a while back.

620
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,200
It's the sort of like where you have the shapes of blocks

621
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,040
and you have to fill them in to fill the whole thing up.

622
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,400
Kind of like what Tetris was based off of.

623
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,080
I played a little bit of that just because, like, I needed to wake up my brain

624
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,440
and that's what did it that day.

625
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,160
Brain training.

626
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,040
Yeah, except like more spatial awareness.

627
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,840
So, yeah, gotcha.

628
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,400
My gaming week because of Covid, honestly, didn't do a lot.

629
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,360
I was really, really exhausted.

630
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,920
And like I was yeah, I was even too tired to game.

631
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,360
Like I watched some people play like DVD on Twitch and stuff,

632
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,840
but that was about the extent of it.

633
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,560
Now, when we got closer to the weekend and I was getting my energy back,

634
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,640
I did play a little bit of No Man's Sky.

635
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,760
I did a stream of that the other night because they did a new patch,

636
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,120
which I think is story slotted later in the show.

637
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,080
So we'll give you the details then.

638
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,320
But they did a Twitch drops campaign to go with it.

639
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,720
So I was streaming Friday night, just a new game,

640
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,240
just messing around with a new game for some drops.

641
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,440
I actually got a good amount of new viewers thanks to that,

642
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,560
because people streaming No Man's Sky will raid other people playing No Man's Sky.

643
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,560
So the drop trains kind of continue for the people that are lurking in the chat.

644
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,000
So because I did that, too, I raided somebody I didn't know.

645
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,920
I was streaming until like two in the morning on Friday.

646
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,720
I never go that late, but I was like, I have a second rush energy here.

647
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,880
So I raided somebody in Australia because I was like,

648
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,200
well, nobody that I know is still streaming at this point, that's for sure.

649
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,800
But yeah, I was having fun playing No Man's Sky.

650
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,280
And then I've been playing a little bit of DBD because of all the changes

651
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,720
that would affect.

652
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,040
I've been exploring that a little bit because, you know,

653
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,000
it kind of mix things up.

654
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,640
I never I never liked using Dead Hard anyway.

655
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,080
I realized it was overpowered. I probably should have been.

656
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,280
I just never liked it as a perk.

657
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,480
I was when I adopted David, I was going to have it on.

658
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,160
But yeah, I was always a fan of Overcome, Jonah's perk.

659
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,040
And that's what a lot of people,

660
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,320
people have either switched to that or sprint burst.

661
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,440
But I've noticed as killer, you can really shut sprint burst down

662
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,960
by running fear monger,

663
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,520
which causes people to be exhausted when they touch a generator.

664
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,040
So I have seen a big surge in fear monger. Yeah.

665
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,680
So and I didn't use my pig build at all.

666
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,200
And it's still pretty solid.

667
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,520
I've also seen a lot more of Gearhead.

668
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
I've seen more make your choice.

669
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,160
I've seen, oh,

670
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,520
what's the hex people are using?

671
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,840
Devour Hope a lot, actually.

672
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,640
Interesting. I haven't seen that one a lot.

673
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,560
But there's there's a few interesting videos I watched.

674
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah.

675
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,640
And I've been just watching, you know, some buddy streamers stream

676
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,000
that game a little bit and just otherwise kind of haven't been doing a lot.

677
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,080
I did get out yesterday and today and I played a little bit of Pokemon Go

678
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,360
and I played a little bit of Ingress and the usual stuff that I play out in the,

679
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,840
you know, out in real life.

680
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,440
I wish I'd thought to ask Shane to call in tonight

681
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,760
because he was at Pokemon Go Fest in Seattle.

682
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,160
He's on the road home now, I'm pretty sure.

683
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,400
But he he, you know, he was not feeling very good on Pokemon Go.

684
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,360
I don't remember if he trashed it on this show or if it was a stream of mine

685
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,240
where because, you know, we buddy up a lot when I stream.

686
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,480
But he was not feeling it.

687
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,040
He uninstalled the game at some point and suddenly he got back into it

688
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,400
and went to Pokemon Go Fest and he had a lot of great things to say about it.

689
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,040
And he said he got 58 shinies across the weekend because

690
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,720
because of course he did.

691
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,360
Of course, he did. It's Shane.

692
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,080
Shane is the shiny one. Yes, yes.

693
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,920
His name in the game is literally shiny hunter, you know, his name.

694
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,840
So it's funny. So. All right.

695
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,480
I'll see. Maybe I can get him to call in later in the show or something.

696
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,120
But in the meantime, let's get into some of the news from this week

697
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
that's been going on.

698
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,000
So, Loki, we start tonight with a game that you really love, right?

699
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Yeah. And also, I played Minecraft this week.

700
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,360
So did I skip your week? I'm sorry.

701
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,280
I didn't mean to do that.

702
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,800
It's OK. Just Minecraft this week.

703
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,280
We did finally hit 500 subscribers, so that's great.

704
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,400
You just finally a week later unlocked my community features now

705
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,680
so I can post non-video updates, polls and all that fun stuff

706
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,000
so I can interact with the community.

707
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,920
So I'll just keep on going.

708
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,440
That's really great. Congratulations. Thank you.

709
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,040
But yeah, now we let's get into the news, so.

710
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,720
All right. How did I blame?

711
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,080
Blame COVID. We'll just blame COVID.

712
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,280
That's what I've done all week.

713
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,720
Yeah. Let's talk about everyone's favorite topic, and that is NFTs.

714
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,240
So Mojang came out, I guess, and addressed

715
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,160
some of the issues with NFTs, mainly because there's been folks

716
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,080
and we've talked about this in like previous weeks where they were using

717
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,480
Minecraft as like a source of like NFTs to basically

718
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,040
they're selling skins or they were selling

719
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,480
seeds to worlds, which is stupid.

720
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,640
I don't know why you would pay for that, but

721
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,200
all of that was done by other people.

722
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,600
So they basically put out a long statement saying that, listen,

723
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,240
our policy on NFTs is that we don't like it and we are

724
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,240
not allowing you to make

725
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,680
blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our Microsoft

726
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,200
or a Minecraft client and server applications, nor may they be utilized

727
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,800
to create NFTs associated with any in-game content,

728
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,320
including world skins, persona items and other mods.

729
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,520
So basically saying, stop it, knock it off.

730
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,560
So that's good, at least that they're, you know, behind that.

731
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,960
I didn't realize people were doing that, creating like a house

732
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,560
or an art piece in Minecraft and NFTs.

733
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,960
You know, it's the bare minimum nonsense that they do.

734
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,920
Like they'll take a skin and they'll like randomize colors on it

735
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,200
and stuff like that and sell it as an NFT.

736
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,600
Like we saw that before they were doing that.

737
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,760
And it was annoying and stupid.

738
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,040
And this this goes back to the point I was saying when we yelled

739
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,640
about NFTs earlier and my message to the crypto bros

740
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,000
who are very invested in NFTs and want these to are really pushing

741
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,800
these as a new thing, people we know and have worked with in the past,

742
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,240
really trying to push this NFT thing.

743
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,760
And I'm like, you know what?

744
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,080
Like people are not going to buy into NFTs

745
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,680
until the rampant thievery and underground BS is stopped.

746
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,520
Like it's always going to be associated with this

747
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,920
until something actually legitimate comes around.

748
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,320
And like this doesn't help the fact that there are all these NFTs

749
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,920
of the bear that are just Minecraft asset ripoffs.

750
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,680
Like this is this is a rampant problem in both of the mobile phone stores.

751
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,480
Anyway, is that, you know,

752
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,400
Minecraft clones galore that look just like, you know, Minecraft and so forth.

753
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,520
And this this is just another thing where it's like you barely

754
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,160
did the bare minimum and it just it just reeks of thievery.

755
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,600
So I'm sure now it didn't people threaten to go make their own game.

756
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,200
Like, oh, then we've minecraffle this, too.

757
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,120
We'll just steal all their assets and make our own game.

758
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,200
I mean, I don't know if they've threatened thievery, but like, yeah,

759
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,520
I mean, they've tried to do that with different things.

760
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,200
Congratulations on threatening to do the thing that every other game

761
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,040
company has been thinking about since Minecraft got popular.

762
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,520
Yeah. So think about it.

763
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,680
Think about it. You're threatening to do the thing.

764
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,800
Every other game company wants to do, and that's find

765
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,160
Minecraft's lightning in a bottle and apply it.

766
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,840
And I would say probably the only thing I can think of that's close

767
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,960
is either something like Stardew Valley, which is really,

768
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,960
you know, or Terraria, which are both very distanced from Minecraft.

769
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,360
They're just, you know, or I would say the Dragon Quest

770
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,760
builders is probably the closest thing that you can really feel the Minecraft

771
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,840
in it that like actually kind of works. So.

772
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,200
VXJ6V in chat says, NFTs are 2020 fan character palette swaps. Yep.

773
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,240
Yeah, that's pretty accurate.

774
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,480
Mike Deft in chat says, By the way, did you see that GameStop NFT

775
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,200
was selling art that was pretty much taken from a 9-11 photo?

776
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,120
Yeah, I saw that.

777
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,760
But that's because I'm not defending it, but it's a symptom of

778
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,240
isn't the GameStop NFT marketplace just a free for all eBay type of thing?

779
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,440
Like it's not exactly restrictive, right?

780
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,840
Like nobody is quality checking the shit they're putting up there, right?

781
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,640
So of course that happened.

782
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,720
Of course, yeah, it's it's yeah, it's a mess.

783
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,760
But I did want to mention, though, on the flip side of that.

784
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,240
Another company that is very much into NFTs is Square Enix.

785
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,960
And so, of course, Square Enix had

786
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,520
put out they're going to be doing like some Final Fantasy seven NFTs.

787
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,160
And despite the fact that, you know,

788
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,960
I don't know if people are necessarily happy about that, I would say probably not.

789
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,000
There's, I guess, some action figures that they're selling now.

790
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,400
It says they're doing active action figures and collector cards

791
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,800
are going to have NFTs bundled with them.

792
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,960
So if you buy them, you're going to get like digital versions of those

793
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,720
that will come alongside them.

794
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,400
So they're they're trying to legitimize it

795
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,000
by pairing it with something that people it's it's like the the movie.

796
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,280
What was the movie everybody?

797
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,960
And you got an NFT when you went and saw the movie.

798
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,640
It was Spider-Man or something, right?

799
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,440
Like people, they're trying to sneak NFTs in so that people

800
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,800
kind of start building a collection and then they want to make a thing.

801
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,400
But it's like, hmm.

802
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,480
Well, here's the thing, too, like the figure,

803
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,040
you can buy the figure for one hundred and thirty dollars

804
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,320
or they have a version that includes the digital copy alongside it for one

805
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,280
hundred and fifty dollars.

806
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,720
And then that's not even coming out until apparently November 2023.

807
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,400
How about so? So, you know.

808
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,960
I don't even know, like, do we know what we're going to be doing in 2023?

809
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,280
I mean, like I could just completely break down by then

810
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,360
or like nobody might be interested in that stuff.

811
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,320
At the end of the day, if people want to buy these, then I guess fine.

812
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,960
It doesn't really hurt Final Fantasy.

813
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,280
But can we just I'm really only OK with it

814
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,920
as long as we can all admit that it's a waste of time.

815
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,640
I want us all to admit that this is a waste of time and resources

816
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,720
and then I'll be OK with it.

817
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,520
Yeah, pretty much.

818
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,880
Anyway, less of a waste of time are some of the updates that are coming to Twitch.

819
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,880
Actually, some of this stuff sounds pretty cool that they have coming.

820
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:18,120
So part of this kind of ties into some things that came up

821
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,160
on the week we were out because of TwitchCon in Amsterdam happened.

822
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,240
So there was that.

823
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,920
So what happened is that Twitch was looking at testing some charity.

824
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,480
I'm sorry, I think this came out after.

825
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,800
I'm not sure what was TwitchCon and what wasn't, but Twitch is going to be

826
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,560
integrating some charity fundraising into their platform.

827
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,800
Right now, this is only in a US beta, so it's available for certain streamers.

828
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,760
But this will allow you to select a charity, set a fundraising goal

829
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,920
and then collect donations within the creator dashboard.

830
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,480
So that's kind of neat.

831
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,000
So, yeah.

832
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,200
And actually, it was funny because Jason and I were talking about this

833
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,040
before the show a little bit tonight because he was talking about this in the intro.

834
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,520
And I was like, maybe this is a thing we can do on our next

835
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,520
like anniversary show or big milestone show is since we've run out of ideas

836
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,960
on how to make those shows special, we'll fundraise.

837
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,040
It'll be nice. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Why not?

838
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,880
So hopefully if it makes it really easy to do, I think that's going to be great.

839
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,240
Now, I know this was announced at TwitchCon because of the reception

840
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,440
that it got is that partners and affiliates are getting the payment threshold lowered.

841
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,000
So now you no longer have to make one hundred dollars in a month

842
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,200
in order to get a check.

843
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,040
You only have to make fifty.

844
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,400
So half as much will actually get you a check.

845
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,240
And of course, if you don't raise the money in one month,

846
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,840
then it rolls over to the next month.

847
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,200
But that's that's cool, you know, because there's actually

848
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,360
there was a month like here at VOG.

849
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,080
I think we had ninety six dollars.

850
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,600
And so it was like no check for you, although the check the next month

851
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,480
was pretty big. But yeah, for for VOG, we had a month where it was ninety six dollars.

852
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,280
So now, thanks to y'all's generosity, we'll probably get a little

853
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,200
fundage in the VOG bank account, which is which will be nice.

854
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,240
It'll allow us to do more conventions and things like that in the future,

855
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,960
which, by the way, I hope you all had fun at Southern Fried Game Expo,

856
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,880
which Bobby went to and we didn't get to talk about that last week

857
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,440
because, you know, covid, but that all happened.

858
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,720
And I'm hoping there'll be more conventions.

859
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,880
Dragon Con is six weeks away.

860
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,880
I can't talk about everything I'm doing at Dragon Con yet

861
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,800
because we're not allowed to promote that stuff until August

862
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,960
when the schedule is final final.

863
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,760
But I've seen my preliminary

864
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,600
schedule and it looks really good.

865
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,760
That's all I can say. It looks.

866
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,720
And I will say this.

867
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,160
It does look like I'm going to have a ballroom panel this year.

868
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,960
Fingers and toes crossed so that that those are the big ones.

869
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,640
So fingers and toes crossed.

870
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,440
So but Loki, I'm going to need your help.

871
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,920
And that's all I'm going to say for now. All right.

872
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,480
Bobby wants to point out that there is a YouTube video up

873
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,320
on the VOG YouTube channel.

874
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,520
So, yeah, of the speed running panel that he did there with

875
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,800
an eternal enigma was doing Silent Hill, the room for.

876
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,400
And and then Bobby at the end does his own little he he did this on his show,

877
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,280
but he does the Zelda link to the past four minute speed run trick

878
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,400
because he's trying to prove a point that like if you want to start speed running,

879
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,600
here you go. Here's a trick that you can try at home because it even works on

880
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,400
the Nintendo Switch online and all that. So there's a cute panel.

881
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,000
So check that out. All right.

882
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,120
Let's see. Where was I? Yes.

883
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,040
Twitch updates. One other thing I want to talk about as well.

884
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,200
Apparently, there is some new safety features that are coming as well,

885
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,480
including more customization on who can actually rage you

886
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:58,080
and being able to share a banned list of banned accounts with other streamers.

887
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,240
So that's nice. Yeah.

888
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,360
So this, of course, all in response to the hate raids,

889
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,120
which were last year, which I admit from my perspective,

890
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,480
I haven't seen nearly as many of those.

891
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:15,200
I'll see us idiot spam bot once in a while or maybe a village idiot here or

892
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,040
there. But I don't see I'm not just saying because I don't see it personally.

893
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
It doesn't happen, but I'm just saying it.

894
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,160
It does seem like I'm not seeing the buzz about it on Twitter.

895
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,600
I'm not seeing the reports about it nearly as much. So it is.

896
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,440
It is nice to see that even though it was kind of slow to get here,

897
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:36,200
that some of these features have really helped curb a lot of the hate raid

898
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,600
stuff. Um, actually, yeah,

899
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,600
I got raided while playing No Man's Sky and I didn't realize I had turned on the

900
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,880
mandatory verification.

901
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,800
So the people who raided me couldn't chat with me for like five minutes because

902
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,760
they were like, Oh crap, we never verified our accounts.

903
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,840
So I guess they were sitting there trying to verify their accounts.

904
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,560
And then when they finally did, they were like, hi, sorry,

905
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,840
we had to verify our accounts. I was like, Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

906
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,280
I had to turn that on. Like, you know, I'm a gay dude who streams.

907
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,560
So unfortunately, you know, one of many targets. Yeah. So, um,

908
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,160
but yeah, so that is, that is something, um,

909
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,920
I've had that on though since I got hate raided last year.

910
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,320
Oh yeah. Yeah. So, um, let's see,

911
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,000
uh, Mike Defton chat says, thank God for the shared ban list.

912
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,040
I've been wanting that for years now. Yeah. I'm,

913
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,800
I'm very interested to see what sort of underground ban list communities end up

914
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,160
getting formed. Um, because of that, that's going to be very interesting. So,

915
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,120
um, I could,

916
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,920
I could almost with certainty say that if you get banned from VOG network,

917
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,040
you'll probably get banned from my channel and Bobby Black Wolf's channel.

918
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,680
And if she wants in probably dark soccer's channel too. And so it'll be,

919
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,720
I'm all about banning people. So, Hey, so you can,

920
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,440
you can start to see what channels are very likely to start ban list sharing.

921
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,360
So, uh, something, something to think about. Yep. And Rama says me too.

922
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,240
So look out, don't be a shit. Yeah. Just don't be a jerk. No,

923
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,920
nobody listening to this show is making plans on being a jerk. I hope, I hope,

924
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,600
if you got this far into this program, we haven't annoyed you yet.

925
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,040
So clearly, you know, the fact that, you know,

926
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,440
our diverse personalities have not annoyed you yet, uh,

927
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,000
hopefully is a good sign. All right. Yeah. Anyway,

928
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,840
let's move on to something that's very happy, very fun news, uh, dark soccer.

929
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,840
Well, um, uh, we're, we're all, we love toys.

930
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,280
We love our Legos and this is actually super cool. Uh,

931
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:43,080
probably I'm not going to be able to afford anytime soon, but, um,

932
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:48,120
Lego has announced the Atari 2,600 set and it looks pretty good.

933
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,880
It's a little wood grain style, you know, that came out when I was, uh,

934
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,320
um, in single age, single number ages. Um,

935
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,640
and it also, it's like, it comes with a cartridge. Um,

936
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,400
it looks like there's actually a few cartridges and the cartridge holder,

937
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,480
we have adventure and centipede and asteroids,

938
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,960
and it also has like a little flip panel where it looks like, you know,

939
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,120
an early 1980s living room.

940
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,360
So I'm down and, uh,

941
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,800
I'm totally down.

942
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,800
There's even like someone playing a key tar on one of the posters. And is,

943
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,600
is that, that better be a cat. It's a cat. Okay.

944
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,000
There is a cat Lego that comes with this. You need it.

945
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,520
Yeah. I, you know, the more and more Lego does, I'm like, dang,

946
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,720
I'm like hundreds of dollars behind and all these sets I want to get.

947
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,400
And I have no,

948
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,040
but I'm really thinking about completely redoing this room and the space you see

949
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:47,840
behind me.

950
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,000
And I'm thinking about putting shelving where the arcade cabinet is now because

951
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,920
I actually have a walk-in closet, um, that you don't really see on camera,

952
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,680
but there's a walk-in closet just to the side of where all the setup is.

953
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,520
And it actually could fit some of the arcade games in there.

954
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,920
So I'm actually thinking about moving the arcade games into like a little walk

955
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,200
in arcade. Um, and then from there being able to, um,

956
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,960
uh, have some different stuff behind me and maybe some Legos. I don't know.

957
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,800
Now I screwed up my webcam.

958
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,320
I know, I know. And you're, to be fair,

959
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,280
you're not truly the first to suggest that either, but, um, yeah.

960
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,680
I can't hear you.

961
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,760
Sorry. I accidentally tapped the mic button when I was adjusting my camera. Um,

962
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,840
it's, it's probably going to end up happening is pretty much what I was saying.

963
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,880
So, and then that allows me lots of space to get more, well,

964
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,960
at least probably one, two, three against the back wall,

965
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,920
probably about three games will fit in there. So that'd be fun. All right. Um,

966
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,880
but I'm really excited about the Lego set.

967
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,760
I want that and I still want some of the Nintendo ones.

968
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,680
I want the princess peach one. I want the Sonic one.

969
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,360
I'm going to need to dip into my savings account.

970
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,200
That's how it begins. Loki, how about you?

971
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,240
Uh, I don't room for any of this stuff.

972
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,720
What do you have in the news though?

973
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,880
Uh, so Ubisoft, um,

974
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,040
they're having to deal with some delays and

975
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,920
cancellations. Um,

976
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,160
so there was an assassin's creed, um, game set in Japan,

977
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,640
I think that was canceled recently. Um, now of course,

978
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,320
avatar frontiers of Pandora is going to be delayed. Um,

979
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,800
it's not going to come out with the release of the new avatar

980
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,680
movie, but Hey, you waited this long for an avatar sequel.

981
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,080
You can wait even longer for an avatar game. So, you know, it's, it's fine. Uh,

982
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,280
so it's going to be, uh,

983
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,640
launching sometime after March 20, 20 threes,

984
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,760
I'm guessing after the fiscal year. Um,

985
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,880
isn't there like another,

986
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,800
aren't there like three avatar sequels or something they're all coming out like

987
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,800
back to back to back or something? I thought that was what their plan was.

988
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,760
That's the plan is, I don't know what the timeframe are of those other movies,

989
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,720
but it's a little late.

990
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,480
And also the last avatar game wasn't great, but I mean, this looks all right,

991
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,800
I guess. I think the movie will do well. I do. I'm sure it will.

992
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,280
I'm sure it will. Um, what else?

993
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,520
So they're saying that right now the current economic

994
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,080
context carefully and strategically managing our investments is critical.

995
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,040
Now more than ever,

996
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,880
we must therefore succeed in strongly limiting our spending to what is

997
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,240
essential by questioning some of our habits and reflexes.

998
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,960
You mean you're,

999
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,560
you're going to look at addressing some of the sexual sexual harassment

1000
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,000
allegations. No, no. Um, by, uh, oh,

1001
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,440
reinventing ourselves together to make gains in terms of cost,

1002
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,040
agility and efficiency. And that's a bunch of nonsense.

1003
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,680
I guess we're not going to see any more laser tag games from them.

1004
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,920
Your CEO. Yeah. Good. Maybe. How about,

1005
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,240
how about if you want to like show you're really going to be committed to

1006
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,440
something radical and take things in a new direction,

1007
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,000
why don't you fire your CEO like that? That, that, that,

1008
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,120
that would really show like, like less talk, more action.

1009
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,360
So some of the games have been canceled so far. Um,

1010
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,760
splinter cell VR goes to recon frontline. Um,

1011
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,920
the second one was supposed to be a battle rail influenced multiplayer game.

1012
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,000
That's what we need more is more battle royale games,

1013
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,800
especially after the last one tank too. So I'm, I'm see why that,

1014
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,960
and a splinter cell VR game sounds terrible. I'm sorry.

1015
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,120
Like it just sounds like you're trying to shove something into VR that doesn't

1016
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,080
need to be there. So yeah. Yeah. Um, so right now they have,

1017
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:47,640
you know,

1018
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,840
their financial strategy is basing it on a Mario and rabbits,

1019
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,000
their new game and the, uh,

1020
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,000
skull and bones game, which is still not out yet. You know,

1021
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,920
it's the Assassin's creed, the, the pirate part of that,

1022
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,720
but not Assassin's creed. So yeah. Um,

1023
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,960
we'll see. And then of course they're still working on their live service

1024
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,480
project. Assassin's creed infinity.

1025
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,560
Is it really infinity though? And also that's a dumb name for it.

1026
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,560
Um, I don't know. Yeah.

1027
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,800
They're going to have a new Ubisoft forward, uh, September 10th.

1028
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,080
Sure. We'll see how that goes. Yeah, I know. Right.

1029
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,880
There better be some big surprises in that.

1030
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,800
Like how else can they partner with Nintendo to save themselves? Who knows?

1031
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,040
We'll see. All right. Um, well,

1032
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,600
let's move on and talk about a game that I'm really into it.

1033
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,120
This seems to be having a nice long life because of plenty full updates that

1034
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:52,000
this game gets. And that's no man's sky. Uh, got another update this week.

1035
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,800
I mentioned it earlier during my gaming week,

1036
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,200
but the update is called the endurance update.

1037
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,680
It is the 20th major update for the game. Dang. I said 18 on Bobby show earlier.

1038
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,680
I didn't realize it was all the way up to 20. Uh,

1039
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,120
this comes after the outlaws update came out in April. Um, this time,

1040
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,720
what's been changed is mostly fleets and freighters,

1041
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,800
but they've also done things with space.

1042
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:16,600
You know how like those really rad science pictures came out this week of space,

1043
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,440
that new camera or whatever,

1044
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,840
like got the really like much clearer pictures of space.

1045
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,360
And you can like see the galaxies out there. And it's like one of those, like,

1046
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,400
like you just want to get high and contemplate life.

1047
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,400
When you look at a picture like that, because it's like, whoa,

1048
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,760
the universe it's so big.

1049
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,320
I think of the Animaniacs song.

1050
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,760
It's a great big universe and we're all really.

1051
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,360
Anyway, well, if you want to sing that song every day, play more, no man's sky.

1052
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,160
Um, so, so, but to me like,

1053
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,880
and this couldn't have been intended because I'm sure they didn't know those

1054
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,760
pictures were coming,

1055
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,760
but I feel like they made the universe with the asteroid artifacts and the stars

1056
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,800
in the sky, and you can see nebulas and things now,

1057
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,520
like they made it more like that photo, uh, making things better.

1058
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,800
So I thought that was really cool,

1059
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,440
but otherwise your freighters can really become a space space,

1060
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,240
more themed rooms. You can have a dedicated room for crops.

1061
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,760
You can have a catwalk so you can walk into your fashion strut. No,

1062
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,640
it's a catwalk outside, but anyway, uh, observation deck, glass corridor.

1063
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,680
So you can like look out at the planets below,

1064
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,240
probably get some really cool photos that way. So yeah, it's just, you know,

1065
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,880
just sounds like they've really, uh, improved the freighter mini game. Um,

1066
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,320
but overall,

1067
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,440
this probably isn't quite as big of an update as they usually are,

1068
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,880
but you know what,

1069
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,880
considering this game is still putting the content out after like six years,

1070
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,880
Hey, it's hard to complain. Uh,

1071
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,360
there will be a new expedition that comes with this as well. Uh,

1072
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,320
Polestar is the name of the new expedition.

1073
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,800
You're gonna be taking your capital ship on the galaxy.

1074
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,760
So they are going to go to freighters and it sounds like you're going to have to

1075
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,160
move your freighter around the galaxy as opposed to your normal spaceships.

1076
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,920
That could be interesting. Um, so, but that has not started yet.

1077
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,720
It's very rare for the expedition to not start with the patch, but again,

1078
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,360
I think they're just ironing out bugs. Um, I hope they are. Cause it was,

1079
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,480
it was kind of a yikes on the last expedition, uh, as a reminder,

1080
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,520
no man's sky will hit the Nintendo switch on October 7th.

1081
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,080
And it's going to have all these patches with it already,

1082
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,760
which makes sense of course. Uh,

1083
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,520
and a PlayStation VR two version will be coming out soon as well.

1084
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,200
And I didn't know this. I thought this already existed, but, um,

1085
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:29,160
um, a dedicated Mac OS version of no man's sky is coming. I thought,

1086
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,720
I thought for sure that already existed, but, um,

1087
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,800
they announced that at WWDC apparently, and I just fell off my radar.

1088
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,400
So, uh, you're muted, shark sucker. I see your mouse, uh, saying something.

1089
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,680
I just said it's about final,

1090
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,280
finally and Capcom is also starting to show more support. So yeah,

1091
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,320
I just assumed it was already on Mac cause it's everywhere else. But, uh,

1092
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,200
there you go.

1093
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,360
I haven't been able to play it since I moved to my, uh, to my Mac.

1094
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,800
Well, maybe, maybe, Hey, I got you into dead by daylight.

1095
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,400
Maybe I'll get you into no man's sky at some point. I don't know.

1096
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,240
It might be a little too.

1097
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,840
You know, if Haver and the people who is it that does VHS would

1098
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,760
ever get rid of the anti-cheat thing and actually use something good.

1099
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,760
I'd be able to play on my steam account, but no, anyway.

1100
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,720
All right. Uh, let's see, uh, dark, uh,

1101
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,240
dark to see and chat says Polestar makes me think of the Neo Geo shoot him up.

1102
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,560
It's it's pole like a flag pole Polestar, but yeah, it's this funny.

1103
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,800
So, um, dark to see it says I'm going to restart my NMS save on piece PS four,

1104
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,520
but I think I'll just wait for the switch version to come out so I can just

1105
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,080
start fresh and on my own system. Yeah.

1106
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,040
Unfortunately there is no cross progression.

1107
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:44,160
The only cross progression that exists is between windows store

1108
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,720
and X-Box series, uh, X-Box one.

1109
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,280
So that, because, and that makes sense, right?

1110
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,880
The Microsoft family is all essentially the same thing,

1111
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,680
whether you're playing it on a PC, uh, or, or an X, a dedicated X-Box,

1112
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,920
that's the only one.

1113
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,440
And that's why I actually moved from X-Box series X where I was playing it to

1114
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,000
now I'm playing it on my new PC, uh, thanks to windows store. So, um,

1115
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,200
let's see. And, um, yeah,

1116
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,680
me says a freighter is the thing you can keep your ships on, right? Yes.

1117
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,320
You always get one after your fifth jump in the game.

1118
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,440
And thank you, Jason.

1119
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,280
And chat reminded me that telescope that takes the pictures,

1120
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,120
the James Webb telescope was the name of the, uh,

1121
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,640
very awesome pictures that came out and just like, seriously,

1122
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,840
like even if you're only like casually into space stuff, it's just like, I,

1123
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,080
I never really considered myself a space nerd,

1124
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:39,040
but I do find I tend to really enjoy sci-fi space games always.

1125
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,040
When I went to the museum of flight in Seattle, I loved the space stuff.

1126
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,880
They have a lot of space stuff there and I loved seeing it. So I think,

1127
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,600
I think I'm, I think I'm a closet space nerd. Well,

1128
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,480
I'm not in the closet about anything these days, but you know,

1129
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,960
a little bit more of a space nerd than I would have thought. So, uh, yeah,

1130
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,120
that's maybe why I like no man's sky and talk about it so much. Who knows? Well,

1131
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:06,240
one system that never got no man's sky was the Wii U and I'm sure it's never

1132
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,440
going to get it. Uh, dark Sakura what's happening in Nintendo's world.

1133
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,440
Do we need to queue in Vogue?

1134
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,440
Never going to get it, never going to get it.

1135
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,440
Um, anyway, um,

1136
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,440
so Nintendo is, uh,

1137
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,440
shutting down the Wii U in 3DS eShop. Um,

1138
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:25,440
start it, wait, this says March. Oh,

1139
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:30,440
nevermind. I'm looking at the wrong date. Um, this is on March 27th, 2023.

1140
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,440
So, I mean, you got like the better part of a year,

1141
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,440
but you got like the better part of a year.

1142
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,440
You know, um, but as of that day, um,

1143
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:44,440
and actually as of August 29th, 2022,

1144
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,440
you won't be able to add funds to either eShop.

1145
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,440
So if you're going to buy them, buy them now, um,

1146
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,440
cause there is no other way to get some of these games. So,

1147
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,440
and this, I think it was bound to happen.

1148
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,440
As Jason called out earlier in the show,

1149
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,440
theater them curtain call is an excellent example of that.

1150
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,440
Um, when they, they could do,

1151
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,440
and some of you are probably wondering like, well,

1152
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,440
how would they do it with the touch pad and everything,

1153
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,440
even though the switch screen,

1154
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,440
but they could adapt the arcade version, uh, and have that. But, um, yeah.

1155
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,440
Uh, and then I was going to say, um,

1156
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,440
the virtual console still has some things. What's that?

1157
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,440
I actually still have my theater of them cartridge. Yeah. And you,

1158
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,440
and if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you,

1159
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,440
if you want to, if you want to, if you want to,

1160
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,440
if you want to, if you want to, if you want to,

1161
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,440
Yeah. And you, and if you bought things on cartridge, that's cool,

1162
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,440
but it might be hard to find those cartridges now.

1163
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,440
Then plus the DLC is going to be the big thing in those games. Um,

1164
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,440
cause there was a lot of DLC for theater of them. So, um, yeah.

1165
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,440
And there's, there's a lot of stuff that was really unique to the 3DS.

1166
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,440
The Wii U probably has a handful of games that never came over to the

1167
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,440
switch that you still might want to check out.

1168
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,440
Like a wonderful one-on-one comes to mind and there's, you know, a few,

1169
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,440
but Nintendo's honestly ported most of their library over to the switch

1170
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,440
at this point. Um, but there's, there's a, there's a few things,

1171
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,440
especially I would say like in the,

1172
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,440
specifically the store that Nintendo shop indie titles and virtual

1173
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,440
console and that stuff that are,

1174
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,440
that are worth picking up because like the Konami titles and that they're,

1175
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,440
they're not showing up in switch online's library for whatever reason. So,

1176
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,440
um, I would be very, uh,

1177
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,440
very much probably going to go through the store and try to pick up a few

1178
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,440
things just to make sure I have them on file for sure.

1179
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,440
Especially on the 3DS. I don't really have my Wii U hooked up as much anymore,

1180
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,440
but I still have a working 3DS.

1181
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,440
Like why wouldn't I make sure I've got everything I want on there?

1182
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,440
So, all right. Uh, on a different note,

1183
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,440
let's go to this next story from Loki.

1184
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,440
Yeah. So there's a brand new indie horror game that's kind of got a weird

1185
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,440
gimmick to it. It's called the refund me if you can.

1186
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:55,440
And of course is it's alluding to the refund policy.

1187
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,440
On steam where if you played a game for more than two hours,

1188
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,440
you cannot refund it.

1189
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:04,440
So the game is challenging you to beat the game in two hours.

1190
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,440
Also after two hours, the achievements are locked forever.

1191
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,440
You can't get any more achievements in the game.

1192
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,440
And so basically it challenges you with going through a maze with a hundred

1193
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,440
different paths, but only one of those is the correct one.

1194
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,440
Oop.

1195
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,440
I didn't mean to.

1196
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,440
All right.

1197
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,440
I didn't mean to play the switch sound effect right issue.

1198
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,440
Sorry.

1199
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,440
I was bringing up a trailer for the next story and the little impeccably

1200
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,440
timed. Uh, sorry about that, but, um,

1201
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,440
it's the problem of running everything from one computer here. Um, yeah,

1202
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,440
it's a, it's a clever little play on that mechanic,

1203
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,440
but it's on the whole, like it's a social commentary on the steam refund

1204
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,440
thing, which I know pisses a lot of developers off,

1205
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,440
but it sounds like the game is not particularly great. Right.

1206
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,440
Like it's.

1207
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,440
It's all right.

1208
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,440
It looks like a little bit.

1209
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,440
It looks, it's all of its shovelware, but it's not like,

1210
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,440
it's not super, super polished. I mean, it,

1211
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,440
it looks like they're charging $4 for it.

1212
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,440
It looks like a game that you'd pay about four bucks for, um,

1213
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,440
which is fine if that's what they're trying to do.

1214
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,440
It's only in like a two hour experience. So.

1215
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,440
I don't know.

1216
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,440
Fine. I guess. Yeah.

1217
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,440
So if, you know, you want to try to beat it in two hours,

1218
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,440
it's fine.

1219
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,440
It's fine.

1220
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,440
Yeah.

1221
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,440
So if you want to try to beat it in two hours, you can.

1222
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,440
I'm sure a lot of people are going to go through the hassle for $4.

1223
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,440
So.

1224
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,440
Dr. C says, so he wasn't expecting to make much on it anyway.

1225
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,440
It seems probably not.

1226
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,440
I'm sure all this free press is going a long way though. And here,

1227
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,440
here we are talking about it too, but I do think it's a,

1228
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,440
I look at it more social commentary than a game. It's,

1229
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,440
it's really like commentary on that system and how it really irks a lot

1230
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,440
of developers.

1231
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,440
Cause there are people that abuse it for sure. So.

1232
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,440
Yeah.

1233
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,440
Well, let's talk about some classics,

1234
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,440
not the classic game of the week just yet, very soon though.

1235
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,440
But let's talk about some classics making their way to the Nintendo

1236
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,440
switch online library. Now,

1237
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,440
you know why I was playing that sound earlier,

1238
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,440
but they actually came out just this week. We got an update to the

1239
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,440
classic Nintendo switch online app.

1240
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,440
We've got fighters history just came out on the Nintendo switch online

1241
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,440
library. This was the one,

1242
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,440
wasn't this the one that ended up causing the lawsuit with Capcom and

1243
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,440
all that, because it's like really similar to street fighter.

1244
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,440
Like it's yeah.

1245
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,440
Also Kirby's avalanche. So, you know, if,

1246
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,440
I love this game wasn't enough,

1247
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,440
then here it is. Kirby's avalanche is coming out instead.

1248
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,440
So that is out as well. And then there's a NES title.

1249
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,440
And this is kind of interesting because this is one that was actually

1250
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,440
imported. This is,

1251
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,440
DIVA is the short name of it.

1252
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,440
The long name of the game is, and of course I closed my screen here.

1253
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,440
So it's imperial of the, yes,

1254
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,440
I could just read the screen. Couldn't I? Yes.

1255
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,440
Is out on the NES.

1256
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,440
And I believe this is something that was only out in Japan before,

1257
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,440
but now it's going to be coming out here and they've done that with a

1258
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,440
few titles and that's cool.

1259
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,440
That's the stuff that I really like to see happen.

1260
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,440
In the Nintendo switch online. So that's pretty cool.

1261
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,440
I believe Japan has a similar lineup,

1262
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,440
but it does get a little different.

1263
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,440
They have a different game coming out.

1264
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,440
And of course, now that I'm trying to find it,

1265
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,440
I don't have my story up and chat room will probably beat me to it.

1266
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,440
But where was it?

1267
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,440
Oh, Japan gets Kirby star status.

1268
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:37,440
Oh, Japan gets Kirby star stacker on the super Famicom instead.

1269
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,440
So it's a different Kirby game instead of Kirby's avalanche,

1270
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,440
because I don't,

1271
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,440
I don't think Kirby's avalanche was actually released in Japan, right?

1272
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:49,440
That was a way to get Puyo Puyo out here in the States was to slap

1273
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,440
Kirby and Sonic on it for the Genesis. So anyway,

1274
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,440
a dark to see and chat says dive.

1275
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,440
What's that?

1276
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,440
Have I not covered it?

1277
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,440
I can't remember that far back. I'd have to search the Wiki.

1278
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,440
Yep. It never, it never came out in Japan.

1279
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,440
It came out in Europe as Kirby's ghost trap.

1280
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,440
Ah, okay.

1281
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,440
And it was developed by Hal Compile and Ben Presto.

1282
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,440
Let's see.

1283
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,440
Yeah.

1284
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,440
SD100 Matt says like if I had a hundred chess chances,

1285
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,440
I couldn't guess that these titles would be on this update,

1286
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,440
such a random pick of games.

1287
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,440
And Mike Deff says, yeah, avalanche wasn't released in Japan.

1288
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,440
Um, yeah. And, um, why, why would they need to, uh,

1289
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:36,440
because it was only in, um, they have Puyo Puyo in Japan.

1290
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,440
Uh, Mike Deff says-

1291
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,440
We also had Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

1292
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,440
Right.

1293
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,440
Uh, Mike Deff says we didn't get Star Stacker here.

1294
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,440
We only got the Game Boy version. Well, again, it is,

1295
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,440
and I've said this before, but I'll say it again.

1296
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:51,440
It is very easy to just create a Japanese Nintendo online account.

1297
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,440
Just create a separate account and localize it to Japan.

1298
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,440
You don't have to buy or sub or anything. You just,

1299
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:00,440
you download the clients and then play them on your US account and you

1300
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,440
can play all this stuff in Japan. Now,

1301
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,440
everything's written in Japanese in the emulator,

1302
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:08,440
but if you play enough of the other one, you know, or, you know,

1303
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,440
it's pretty easy to figure that stuff out now at this point. So, uh,

1304
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,440
check that out. All right. Uh,

1305
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:18,440
now I think we will talk about officially a little bit more of a classic

1306
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,440
time. So let's go to the next segment.

1307
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:31,440
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,

1308
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,440
or I'll dive into the and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1309
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,440
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1310
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:44,440
I keep having audio leak through when I don't intend to.

1311
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:48,440
I'll blame the COVID. All right. What's the classic classic game of the week

1312
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,440
tonight, Darsagra?

1313
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,440
Mushi Himesama.

1314
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,440
Mushi Himesama, which means bug princess.

1315
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,440
It is one of those cave shooters because it's by cave.

1316
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:07,440
And it was originally distributed by AMI in 2004

1317
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,440
and then redistributed to arcades in 2011.

1318
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,440
So, um, that version though, was the, uh,

1319
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,440
version, uh, 1.5.

1320
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,440
That was a bit different and that one was ported to PlayStation 2,

1321
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,440
but I'll get into the ports and all this stuff. So anyway, um,

1322
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:30,440
the game has a, uh, um,

1323
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,440
a bug theme. As you can tell, um, the enemies resemble beat, uh,

1324
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,440
beetles and butterflies and you go through forest environments.

1325
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,440
Um, and it is as wild

1326
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:47,440
as, as one might expect it to be. It, it is very,

1327
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,440
very cave. Anyway,

1328
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:54,440
in the world of Mushi Himesama, there is an untainted,

1329
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,440
uh,

1330
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:00,440
one where there are these areas change into lush forests

1331
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:05,440
and all by arthropods called koju and they're basically big bugs.

1332
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,440
Um, but when they die,

1333
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:12,440
vegetation grows up around them. So they do the life cycle,

1334
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,440
but, um, their,

1335
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,440
their life sense is poisonous to humans.

1336
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,440
So they have to sacrifice like a 15 year old girl,

1337
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:27,440
but this time the one who had to do it was the princess or something.

1338
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:31,440
So she's just like, uh, no, um,

1339
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,440
every like stuff goes wrong and she has to, to, you know,

1340
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:41,440
kill the bugs. So at any rate, um,

1341
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,440
the game was, I mean, really, really great. There was, uh,

1342
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,440
the PS2 port by Taito, um,

1343
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:54,440
that came out in 2005 in Japan does limited version that had, uh,

1344
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:59,440
little, uh, figures of, uh, Reko and, uh, Kinero, um,

1345
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,440
exclusive on that one, as well as an arranged mode, um,

1346
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,440
a variation of the maniac mode where you start off with much more firepower,

1347
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,440
but no continues.

1348
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,440
And if you make a bullet with an enemy while holding a bomb, you don't die,

1349
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,440
but you release the bomb instead. Um, and then you can, of course,

1350
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,440
move through all of your weapons. Um, now,

1351
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,440
another thing about this one,

1352
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:29,440
and this is what people may be more familiar with in the U S is the iOS

1353
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,440
version, which I played a bunch of, um,

1354
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,440
but it was, uh, uh, Mushihime Sama, uh, Hutari.

1355
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,440
Um, actually I take that back. We're going back.

1356
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:45,440
Mushihime Sama bug panic was the one that came out on, um, on iOS.

1357
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,440
And, uh, it was, I mean,

1358
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:53,440
you could put it up to hell mode, which played like the arcade release.

1359
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,440
I played on easy mode. Um, and then there,

1360
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,440
and then there was the sequel, um, in 2006,

1361
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,440
which was Mushihime Sama Hutari. Um,

1362
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:07,440
Hutari is, means two. So it's bug princess duo.

1363
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:11,440
So it was a two player bullet hell. Um, and then, uh,

1364
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,440
other versions that came out is that Cave did an HD version for

1365
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,440
Xbox 360 on May 24, 2012 in Japan that had novice arranged in

1366
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:25,440
Xbox 360 mode, um, where the arrange is the modified PS2 arranged mode.

1367
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,440
Um, no arcade mode.

1368
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,440
The Xbox 360 mode is as like the arcade release,

1369
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,440
but with better visuals. And, and then the, uh,

1370
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,440
the first copies had version 1.5 is DLC. Um,

1371
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,440
and there were limited editions and an arranged soundtrack and all of

1372
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,440
that. And then, uh,

1373
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:48,440
Digica released a port for windows through

1374
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,440
steam on November 5th, 2015.

1375
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,440
And it was developed, uh, pretty much by cave,

1376
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:57,440
but it's based on the Xbox 360, uh,

1377
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,440
HD port with all of the similar modes,

1378
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,440
but without that, um,

1379
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:06,440
the version 1.5 mode that could be, um, uh,

1380
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,440
could be arranged in there were like limited release qualities.

1381
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:14,440
And so steam had paid DLC available for all of that.

1382
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:19,440
Um, of course the steam one was international while the Xbox 360 port

1383
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:23,440
was, uh, NTSC J region locked.

1384
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,440
So, I mean,

1385
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,440
Famitsu gave this some pretty, uh,

1386
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,440
favorable ratings for the PS2.

1387
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,440
It got a 26 out of 40,

1388
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,440
but the Xbox 360 version got a 31 out of 40. So they really, really,

1389
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:40,440
you know, bumped it up quite a bit. Um,

1390
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,440
it was, uh, for Metacritic,

1391
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,440
it has an aggregate score of 86 of a hundred. Um,

1392
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:51,440
Destructoid gave the PC version a nine out of 10 saying that it is a

1393
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:55,440
must play title. And I think it's just one of those, you know,

1394
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,440
really cute,

1395
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:04,440
yet very difficult games. And I mean,

1396
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,440
not everyone knew about Mushihime Sama.

1397
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,440
I'm just going to throw that out there. It is a little bit one,

1398
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,440
I think of the lesser known ones outside of bullet hell fans,

1399
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,440
you know, here, uh, outside of Japan.

1400
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:19,440
I'm definitely one of those people. Like I did not, I,

1401
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,440
I feel like you've probably showed me this game like very quickly before,

1402
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,440
but I just, I don't remember this one at all, but it looks very cool.

1403
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,440
Like it's, it doesn't even work on iOS anymore. Ah,

1404
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,440
yeah. It's been completely retired,

1405
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,440
I think because it required different architecture to play.

1406
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,440
But yeah, I mean,

1407
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:42,440
I always thought that there should be like a Mushihime Sama RPG or

1408
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,440
something. Cause it lights up a little universe that was in,

1409
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,440
but that's it. There it is.

1410
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,440
There it is your classic game of the week, bug princess,

1411
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,440
Mushihime Sama. It's a classic game of the week. Uh, I,

1412
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,440
are we going to have a theme of cave shooters?

1413
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,440
Cause I think you did one very, you did one last week too, right?

1414
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,440
Or two weeks ago, I guess.

1415
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,440
No, I did Ikaruga.

1416
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,440
Yeah. So not long ago.

1417
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,440
So anyway, um,

1418
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,440
Which was treasure.

1419
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,440
Good. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1420
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,440
Good pick for your classic game of the week. Uh, thank you. Thank you.

1421
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,440
Um, all right.

1422
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,440
Let's travel around and do quickly some rapid fire news and see what else

1423
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,440
is going on in the gaming industry. Loki.

1424
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,440
We have some more characters announced for multi-versus.

1425
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,440
So we have LeBron James, uh,

1426
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,440
as featured in space jam,

1427
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,440
a new legacy is going to be a character in the game as well.

1428
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,440
And then of course,

1429
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,440
Rick and Morty are going to be appearing as well.

1430
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,440
And those are actually as of the 26.

1431
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,440
So in a couple more days, they'll be available to play.

1432
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,440
Um, neat, I guess.

1433
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,440
Still not a fan of the game of the week.

1434
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,440
Yeah.

1435
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,440
And then, uh,

1436
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,440
no more heroes is going to be coming to our normal heroes.

1437
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:53,440
Three is going to be coming to PC, PlayStation and Xbox in October.

1438
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,440
Uh, it looks like on the 11th of October.

1439
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,440
So that's pretty awesome.

1440
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,440
I'll have to check that out.

1441
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,440
Uh, dark Sakura.

1442
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,440
It's so well.

1443
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,440
A controversial thing actually,

1444
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,440
believe it or not is that, uh,

1445
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,440
we're going to be talking about, uh,

1446
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,440
the, uh,

1447
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,440
uh,

1448
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,440
uh,

1449
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,440
well,

1450
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,440
a controversial thing actually,

1451
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,440
believe it or not is that, um,

1452
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:19,440
the dead by daylight attack on Titan collection is now available in

1453
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,440
version 6.1 0.

1454
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,440
Um, it looks,

1455
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:28,440
everybody looks really good except for Dwight and Jake.

1456
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,440
Just saying they're saggy,

1457
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:33,440
but pants make them look like they have no waist.

1458
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,440
Oh, I hate, I hate the Felix.

1459
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,440
I cannot stand the Felix.

1460
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,440
I like the Felix one.

1461
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,440
The Felix one is very,

1462
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,440
I mean, his hair isn't good because that hair just doesn't suit him,

1463
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:46,440
but the outfit is, I mean, very, you know,

1464
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:50,440
The killer, the killer skins are fantastic though.

1465
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,440
I don't really care for the spirit that much,

1466
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:57,440
but I do like how Oni looked and I now have a special space in my heart

1467
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,440
for that Oni cosmetic because I stayed completely hidden from an Oni an

1468
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,440
entire match who was wearing that cosmetic.

1469
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:08,440
He saw me once and then I got out with hatch and no hooks and no hits.

1470
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,440
Uh, Dr. Seuss says I saw that,

1471
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,440
but didn't know what the reception was from the DVD community.

1472
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,440
So can I get into a little something?

1473
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,440
Yeah, sure.

1474
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,440
I have a feeling you're going to go.

1475
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,440
So yeah.

1476
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,440
Yeah.

1477
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:24,440
So there's a lot of controversy around the ending of attack on Titan and

1478
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:28,440
even a lot of the various themes that come out in it that, um,

1479
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:33,440
some people argue that it is flat out antisemitism.

1480
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,440
Um, and certainly if you know your history very well and have paid attention

1481
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,440
to some of the, uh, I can make words happen,

1482
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:43,440
publications of the, uh, uh, mangaka.

1483
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:50,440
Um, he's got some very interesting heroes in even going so far as to

1484
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:55,440
pattern a character in the anime after a very controversial, uh,

1485
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,440
commander, uh,

1486
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,440
who is responsible for quite a few atrocities against, uh, uh,

1487
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,440
the Korean people and Chinese people. And actually as a result,

1488
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,440
attack on Titan has been banned in China.

1489
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,440
Um,

1490
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,440
but I don't want to go too much into it because I certainly do see the

1491
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:17,440
parallels, even though I'm not convinced it's intentional,

1492
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,440
maybe.

1493
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:19,440
Um,

1494
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:24,440
but at the same time,

1495
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,440
there are quite a few people, um,

1496
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,440
in the community who have, uh,

1497
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,440
stated that they are leaving the game over it.

1498
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,440
Oh, wow.

1499
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,440
Um, and I understand why.

1500
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:40,440
And, but we'll,

1501
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:45,440
if anyone wants to know more about it, uh,

1502
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,440
I've got links for you and I'm not going to go into the rest of my,

1503
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,440
I've gone into my personal opinions on my, on my stream, um,

1504
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,440
right when everything came out, I addressed my feelings on it. Um,

1505
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,440
so, but it's all completely up to,

1506
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,440
up to you guys. And by the way, uh, Ron Chan,

1507
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,440
the presence of a Manji is a little bit different.

1508
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,440
I mean, basically it's mostly Western cultures that have a problem with

1509
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,440
the use of Manji,

1510
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:19,440
which is actually going exactly the opposite way of a swastika.

1511
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,440
This is different. This is going into full on,

1512
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:28,440
like for some people saying that it is a,

1513
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:34,440
a complete parallel, a, no, this is what I mean. This is, you know,

1514
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,440
this conspiracy theory and I'm mirroring it in my show,

1515
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,440
but I don't think that's entirely it.

1516
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:44,440
I mean, your mileage may vary. Don't at me because honestly,

1517
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:48,440
I've done my research. I know what I'm talking about.

1518
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:52,440
I didn't really care for it after the second season anyway, but

1519
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,440
take it as you will.

1520
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,440
I don't know the show at all. I've never bothered, you know,

1521
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:01,440
I'll admit the first two seasons were freaking great. I mean, I,

1522
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:06,440
I loved it. It was, and then it just like, it took that turn then like,

1523
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,440
okay. Okay.

1524
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:13,440
I don't really care for the direction that this is going in and kind of lost

1525
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,440
interest.

1526
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:18,440
The first few seasons were action and had great character development.

1527
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,440
I mean,

1528
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,440
it got weird.

1529
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,440
But to go back to the original question about how has it been received by

1530
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,440
the community? I mean, these things are,

1531
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,440
and these types of skins always seem to print money for behavior

1532
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,440
entertainment. And again, I, this.

1533
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:34,440
First major pairing with an anime studio. Yeah.

1534
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,440
I have, I have no data to back this up besides,

1535
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,440
I see one of these skins in every match I've been playing recently.

1536
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,440
Yeah.

1537
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,440
This week. I see one,

1538
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,440
a lot of these skins in every match I've been playing recently.

1539
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,440
Yeah.

1540
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,440
Uh, this week I see one like a Zorina almost.

1541
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:53,440
I love that skin is the best at all the survivors. I'm for sure. So, um,

1542
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,440
yeah, or, or the killer ones. I see,

1543
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,440
I've seen that spirit a couple of times now, so it's just, uh, yeah.

1544
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,440
But, um, I mean, and I actually really like, uh,

1545
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,440
Kate's Historia outfit. Cause.

1546
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,440
First of all, she's closed.

1547
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,440
I can't, I can't stand the ACE one,

1548
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,440
but apparently it's very loyal to the characters.

1549
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,440
I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

1550
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,440
I can't, I can't stand the ACE one,

1551
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:17,440
but apparently it's very loyal to the character.

1552
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,440
The ACE one I think is really good because it makes ACE actually look

1553
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:23,440
decent. Um, but, um, I,

1554
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,440
I have to actually, there's a point that I agree with that, uh,

1555
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:30,440
Losing Color pointed out about the hair for some of these is that the

1556
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:35,440
hairs look like they're a bad wig that don't fit,

1557
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:38,440
but some of them actually look really good. Like of course,

1558
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,440
Zarina and, um, Kate as Historia. So, um,

1559
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,440
but everybody else,

1560
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:49,440
they try to do the anime hair thing in Dead by Daylight and it doesn't

1561
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,440
work. The style just doesn't match up that way.

1562
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:58,440
So, at any rate, that's my aesthetic, uh, judgment.

1563
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:03,440
Also, uh, Dwight and, uh, um, uh, Jake look dumpy. The end.

1564
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,440
All right. Uh, one more story. This one's coming out of Comic-Con,

1565
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,440
which is going on San Diego Comic-Con happened this weekend.

1566
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,440
And so we've been getting some headlines out of that, including, uh,

1567
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,440
that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Kawabunga collection,

1568
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,440
which is basically Konami's latest collection of stuff, uh,

1569
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,440
is going to be happening. Uh, and, uh, we,

1570
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,440
we knew the game was coming, but now we know the date.

1571
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,440
August 30th is the release date of the game. PS5, PS4,

1572
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,440
Xbox one, Xbox series, PC, Nintendo switch.

1573
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,440
So pretty much anything with a power switch that plays modern games will

1574
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,440
be able to run this as well. Uh, 13 games across the eight and 16 bit eras,

1575
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,440
or the time when Konami actually had the license, uh,

1576
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:45,440
including the arcade version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, uh,

1577
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,440
the original, uh, as well as Turtles in Time.

1578
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,440
And then the first four console games, uh, Genesis game,

1579
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:56,440
Game Boy games, tournament fighters, NES, SNES, Genesis.

1580
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,440
There's so much Ninja Turtles in here.

1581
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:05,440
Tiger claw is going to be very happy for at least two weeks. So enjoy that.

1582
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:09,440
But no, I'm, I'm going to be happy too. I, I even, okay. Okay.

1583
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:14,440
Who's ready for a hot take? I even actually really enjoy the original eight

1584
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,440
bit game. Yes. It's hard as hell. Yes. It's, it,

1585
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,440
it's kind of derpy compared to the arcade. I, I,

1586
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:25,440
I just have memories from being a kid playing it that I actually kind of enjoy

1587
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,440
it for five minutes before I switched to something else.

1588
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,440
But that's what these collections are for, right?

1589
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:36,440
Now you can get an achievement and prove to your friends that you beat that

1590
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:40,440
stupid underwater level and you can officially have that achievement in your

1591
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,440
inventory. Actually, I don't know if it has the achievement in the inventory,

1592
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:45,440
but, uh, that's my assumption. So, uh,

1593
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,440
and tiger claw does point out you could use safe states. So that's true.

1594
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,440
That's true. All right.

1595
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,440
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a

1596
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,440
little sooner than the cowabunga collection. Uh, Loki,

1597
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,440
we'll start with the U S yeah. We have a surprising number of games actually

1598
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,440
coming out this week. So, uh, starting things off, we have hell point,

1599
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:10,440

1600

1601
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:19,440

1622
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:04,440

1623
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:09,440
switch is it. Things are becoming a little more global in the release stuff,

1624
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:14,440
especially on the switch front. That's just a general trend that's been happening thanks to the shift to digital.

1625
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:19,440
So anyway, a mysterious saga to the sacred sword of

1635
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:09,440
Going over to Japan. I wasn't kidding. Loki really did mention pretty much a lot of the same stuff that's coming out in Japan.

1636
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:14,440
Let me hit on some of the highlights. Did you survive also on the switch this week? That's

1637
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:19,440
probably going to be a pretty big one. Dungeon munchies is coming out as well in Japan this week on the

1638
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:24,440
28th as your striker gun volt three in a regular and a limited edition is out that

1639
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:29,440
Komaju Remilia Scarlet Symphony is out in a regular and limited edition, but it is

1640
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:34,440
being released in English in Japan. Grim grimoire once more also out on the switch

1641
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:39,440
this week and final vendetta also out this week. And there is

1642
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:44,440
actually a new controller coming out that is a Pokemon Charizard Vortex themed

1643
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:49,440
controller that's coming out this week. That might be third party actually. I'm not sure why that's snuck on my list, but there it is.

1644
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:54,440
And then of course Xena Blade Chronicles three I'm pretty sure is a worldwide release. So that is

1645
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:59,440
also out in a regular and collector's edition this week in

1646
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:04,440
Japan. Quickly looking at the PS5 to see what we have different there. The Legend of Heroes

1647
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:09,440
Kuro Nukisuke is out in Japan this week as well as

1648
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:14,440
that's it. Final Vendetta is also out on the PS5 this week in

1649
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:19,440
Japan. Let's go to Europe Dark Sakura. In Europe we have

1650
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:24,440
on the 28th for PC or for actually any computer Sims 4

1651
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:29,440
High School Years expansion pack. On Switch on the 29th

1652
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:34,440
the rest of these are all the 29th. We have Xena Blade Chronicles 3 PlayStation. We have Story of Seasons

1653
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:39,440
Pioneers of Olive Town, Lawn Mowing Simulator Landmark Edition,

1654
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:44,440
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge and also Digimon

1655
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:49,440
Survive. I guess I can actually say

1656
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:54,440
Ninja instead of Hero. I think they did rebrand it officially in Europe

1657
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:59,440
finally. At some point they finally turned it around.

1658
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:04,440
All right. We have some more into stories and then we're going to get to your

1659
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:09,440
calls, emails and other comments in our Listener Roundtable. But first

1660
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:14,440
Loki. Yeah, so there is a brand, well there's

1661
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:19,440
always new content coming to Grand Theft Auto Online but this is supposed to be one of the biggest

1662
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:24,440
updates that they've done for Grand Theft Auto Online. It's coming out on July 26th called Criminal Enterprises

1663
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:29,440
and they're supposed to be, I guess it's supposed to be topical

1664
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:34,440
but that is part of the update. They're adding a series of

1665
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:39,440
new missions that you team up with the IAA which is I guess like the CIA

1666
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:44,440
and then you take down, apparently you're trying to take

1667
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:49,440
down a notorious oil rich dynasty in Los

1668
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:54,440
Santos. It's people who are profiteering off of heat and soaring prices.

1669
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:59,440
Oh my gosh, it's like ripped out of the headlines. So

1670
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:04,440
in it they're also going to have some more ways to make cash in the game

1671
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:09,440
with in-game businesses including biker bars which is kind of cool, kind of a throwback

1672
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:14,440
to Lost and Damned.

1673
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:19,440
Except I'm not interested in it because it's not a single player expansion.

1674
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:24,440
I'll just wait for six. But yeah, all this time they've

1675
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:29,440
been working on it and it ends up being that. Well and then they've added some more

1676
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:34,440
quality of life changes they said so players will now be able to buy max ammo for all weapons at

1677
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:39,440
once via some interactions menu. What else

1678
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:44,440
site? On PC you'll be able to turn off chat.

1679
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:49,440
None of these look really, really interesting.

1680
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:54,440
The race creator tool has been greatly expanded. So that's cool.

1681
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:59,440
Allowing to increase the player count and add more checkpoints and props because I

1682
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:04,440
know you had kind of a limited amount of like objects you can use because of memory

1683
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:09,440
stuff. But I'm sure since we're now just continue the PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360

1684
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:14,440
actually even PlayStation 3 and Xbox got this game has been out so long. So like

1685
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:19,440
with the previous versions being discontinued obviously those caps can

1686
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:24,440
go up because the newer consoles can handle more objects and stuff in game.

1687
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:29,440
So I like to see that because there's you can do some crazy stuff with those races.

1688
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:34,440
So that's pretty cool at least. Still not going to play it.

1689
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:39,440
All right. Let's go to Dark Sakura with an interesting development in this saga.

1690
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:44,440
Unions, unions, we like unions.

1691
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:49,440
So another Activision Blizzard studio is trying to unionize

1692
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:54,440
20 QA workers at Blizzard Albany.

1693
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:59,440
They filed for union election. They were formerly known as Vicarious Visions.

1694
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:04,440
That's a cool name. And so they went public on this past

1695
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:09,440
Tuesday and filed for union election with the National Labor

1696
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:14,440
Relations Board, the NLRB. And the group said it was seeking representation

1697
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:19,440
with the Communications Workers of America. So 20 workers

1698
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:24,440
were involved with that, as I mentioned earlier, and they want

1699
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:29,440
more pay transparency, fair compensation, better benefits. And they want to work with

1700
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:34,440
Activision Blizzard to have a process, a good process for

1701
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:39,440
addressing workplace issues predominantly involving

1702
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:44,440
employee misconduct. So

1703
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:49,440
here's a quote from the group. QA is currently an undervalued

1704
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:54,440
discipline in the games and software industries. We strive to foster work environments where we are

1705
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:59,440
respected and compensated for our essential role in the development process.

1706
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:04,440
So Activision did acknowledge the request,

1707
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:09,440
but they haven't said anything other than this quote from one of their

1708
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:14,440
spokespeople. Our top priority remains our employees. We deeply respect the rights

1709
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:19,440
of all employees under the law to make their own decisions about whether or not to join a union. We believe the direct relationship

1710
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:24,440
between the company and its employees is the most productive relationship. The company will be publicly

1711
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:29,440
and formally providing a response to the petition to the NLRB.

1712
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:34,440
The snowball is continuing to build.

1713
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:39,440
People. Yeah. I'm very curious to see how this

1714
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:44,440
can because of a curious visions. That was a pretty big day. They were the big part of the Diablo 2

1715
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:49,440
remake that came out last year. So that's that. And that was a pretty big release. So I'm

1716
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:54,440
very curious to see how this all plays out. Yeah. And the

1717
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:59,440
Tony Hawk one and two remakes as as showing her to Matt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So very curious to see

1718
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:04,440
how this continues. I mean, I think I think they end up unionizing.

1719
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:09,440
I think that part's not a surprise. I think it's the continued snowball effect from here.

1720
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:14,440
So but we knew it was coming. All right. And it's needed.

1721
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:19,440
We all know it's needed. All right. Just a few more stories. Loki. Yep.

1722
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:24,440
So Roblox is doing some work to try to improve the graphics

1723
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:29,440
in the game. So they've, I guess, done some slight changes

1724
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:34,440
to how some of the materials are displayed in game. So the way kind

1725
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:39,440
of Roblox works with like building stuff, they have different materials which would have different like

1726
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:44,440
lighting on them. And then with that, you basically create an object and then

1727
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:49,440
say, OK, this is concrete, this is rubber or whatever. And they have

1728
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:54,440
different physics effects and stuff like that. So now the lighting is slightly different.

1729
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:59,440
Honestly, I'm looking at the two screenshots here. It's like the new one looks darker.

1730
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,440
It's like The Last of Us remaster. It's not not night

1731
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:09,440
and day different, honestly. Cool. It'll look nicer.

1732
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:16,440
I don't know. Yeah, that's cool for those people that like that, but I am not

1733
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:21,440
one of those people. It's yeah, I mean, like it's they say it's like a materials

1734
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:26,440
update, like I'm looking at the screenshots here and like. It

1735
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:31,440
it's slightly better. I mean, like I don't know.

1736
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:36,440
Zen Monkey 11 in chat says don't try to fix what ain't broken Roblox. You're going to fuck it up.

1737
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:41,440
You know, I don't think it's I don't think you're going to fuck it up. I think what they're doing is they're just making it so

1738
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:46,440
that because I mean, a lot of the people that make these games in Roblox are kids and they don't know

1739
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:51,440
like how to light stuff correctly and stuff. They're just using kind of the templates and stuff that they have.

1740
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:56,440
So all they're doing is just taking that and making it look a little bit better. Kind of think of like

1741
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:01,440
I guess adding shaders to Minecraft a little bit. Not not to that

1742
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:06,440
extent, but like, you know, it's still the same game, but

1743
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:11,440
they're like lighting it a little bit better or they're adding, you know, some, you know,

1744
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:16,440
sub scatter, you know, reflections and stuff like that just to help

1745
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:21,440
make it pop a little bit. Kind of, you know, update it a bit.

1746
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:26,440
It's a pretty old game at this point. All right.

1747
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:31,440
Well, how about an old band in a new but an amazing band,

1748
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:36,440
the best band of all time, in my opinion, in a rather new franchise, which honestly

1749
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:41,440
was a franchise I did not even know about until I had seen this story.

1750
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:46,440
But it's the Let's Sing franchise and they are going to be getting

1751
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:51,440
an ABBA game is coming out for Let's Sing. Unfortunately, I do not have

1752
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:56,440
footage of Let's Sing ABBA, but I do have footage I can show here on Twitch of Let's Sing

1753
01:37:56,440 --> 01:38:01,440
Queen, which, you know, is also pretty cool. But this game came out in 2020.

1754
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:06,440
But you can get an idea. Yes, it's another karaoke game that is available and

1755
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:10,440
it looks a lot like Sing Star.

1756
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:15,440
It looks a lot like Sing Star. Yeah, it looks to me it's not

1757
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:20,440
developed by the same people, but I want to know if it's even like maybe some of the

1758
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:25,440
Sing Star hasn't been around for years now. They got rid of that. I wonder if it isn't some of the same people that

1759
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:30,440
worked on that because there's a very similar vibe going on with Let's Sing.

1760
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:35,440
So Let's Sing has been around since like the Wii. So yeah, it's the same

1761
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:40,440
the same type of vibe like that they've been doing. Yeah, this was it's it's a

1762
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:45,440
you know, a third party kind of karaoke game thing.

1763
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:50,440
But I mean, Sing Star is gone. And so now it's like, hey, all these competition, all the competition's gone.

1764
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:55,440
Cool. Now they can probably pull out these bigger titles. Well, it's interesting to me, though,

1765
01:38:55,440 --> 01:39:00,440
that they're even taking the same trajectory as Sing Star because Sing Star

1766
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:05,440
had a queen version and then they had an ABBA version. And that's what Dark Saga is talking about is the videos of me

1767
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:10,440
singing and doing Sing Star ABBA back in the day, which I had on PlayStation 3. Of course I bought that. Of course

1768
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:15,440
I bought that game. You had witnesses in person or was that the dance game? That was the dance game. There was the dance game.

1769
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:21,440
I never. Yeah, that was the dance game on the Wii. They also tried to do Let's Dance as well.

1770
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:26,440
They tried to compete against Just Dance and that's just never going to happen. That's right.

1771
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:31,440
OK. But anyway, so even though I'm showing Let's Sing Queen on the screen,

1772
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:36,440
Let's Sing ABBA is coming out and it's expected on the switch later this year.

1773
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:41,440
It will have 30 ABBA hits, including one from Voyage,

1774
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:46,440
the latest album, because, as you know, ABBA put out a new album this year for the first time

1775
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:51,440
since 1982, which is wild. But I'm thrilled,

1776
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:56,440
obviously. They didn't say which song from Voyage is in it, but I'm assuming it's either Don't Shut Me Down

1777
01:39:56,440 --> 01:40:01,440
or the ballad that was the single, which in the moment I can't.

1778
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:06,440
I still have faith in you. I'm like, where did the ABBA fan go? OK.

1779
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:11,440
But also, you know, and they also say in this game, of course, they're going to have Mama Mia,

1780
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:16,440
Dancing Queen, Waterloo, Money, Money, Money. Thank you for the music. The winner

1781
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:21,440
takes it all. Take a chance on me and more. Of course, we don't know how much it costs yet,

1782
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:26,440
but I'll still be buying it. But will it have my favorite ABBA song?

1783
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:32,440
Does anyone remember my favorite ABBA song? It was a single, but it wasn't a well-known single.

1784
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:38,440
It was in Sing Star ABBA, so I'm hoping it'll be in this one. But something

1785
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:43,440
You can never pronounce? Something got bumped. Are you thinking Chiquitita? Not that one.

1786
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:48,440
Not that one. That's a great song, though. But I'm going to say that about every ABBA song. I don't know if there's an ABBA song I don't like.

1787
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:53,440
So, well, the Christmas one on the new album is a little meh, but I love ABBA.

1788
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:58,440
Thank you for the music, is it? I love that song, but no. My favorite,

1789
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:06,440
especially, I was going to say the winner takes it all when Meryl Streep sings it in the movie.

1790
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:13,440
But no, my favorite ABBA song is When All is Said and Done from The Visitors.

1791
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:19,440
And that's the one that they let Pierce Brosnan sing in the movie because they added it from the musical,

1792
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,440
and I wish they hadn't, to be quite honest.

1793
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:27,440
Didn't I give you a copy of Supertrooper on vinyl?

1794
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:31,440
Oh, yes, you did. You did. That's right, I did. Yeah.

1795
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:35,440
I found it at a thrift store, and I was like, Rob needs this, and then I didn't give it to you for two years.

1796
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:41,440
I bought The Visitors when I was in Seattle on vinyl, because that's my favorite ABBA album is The Visitors,

1797
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,440
which includes that song.

1798
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:50,440
I just happened to find an ABBA album, and I'm like, Rob wants this, I'm sure. And if he doesn't, then he's gonna.

1799
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:55,440
ZenMonkey11 says, I want that ABBA song Madonna stole the beat from. Shit is dope.

1800
01:41:55,440 --> 01:42:00,440
Well, it's all over, Gimme Gimme Gimme a Man After Midnight is the song you're looking for.

1801
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:07,440
That is also, the erotic version is in my rotation during my stream.

1802
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:15,440
That erotic cover of, and I'm not talking about erotic, the description, I'm talking about the 90s band that was,

1803
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:18,440
well, they're back now as everything from the 90s is, but they're in DDR.

1804
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:23,440
They're all over DDR, like, you know, their songs from back in the day are all over DDR.

1805
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:28,440
But that band did a cover of ABBA albums, and it's actually really fucking good.

1806
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,440
It's really good.

1807
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:32,440
Their cover of Angel Eyes is amazing.

1808
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:36,440
I love, actually, their cover of Take a Chance on Me.

1809
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:41,440
Yeah, like, honestly, that erotic ABBA album is fucking a bop.

1810
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,440
Like, I think it's on Spotify now.

1811
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,440
It's on Apple Music.

1812
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:48,440
Yeah, I was gonna say, if it's on Spotify, then it's also on Apple Music and all the other big ones.

1813
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:56,440
So it's definitely worth checking out if you even somewhat enjoy ABBA and or erotic.

1814
01:42:56,440 --> 01:43:01,440
That's just absolutely delightful.

1815
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,440
Yeah.

1816
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:07,440
So, of course, now the chat is asking, as Joe 100 Matt says, so let's sing ABBA stream when?

1817
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,440
That is if Twitch even lets you do it.

1818
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,440
That's a good question.

1819
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,440
I'm willing to do it.

1820
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,440
I don't know if Bobby will let me.

1821
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,440
I'm willing to do it.

1822
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,440
We probably would just have to delete the archive.

1823
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,440
Like, we probably couldn't even have an archive.

1824
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:27,440
Rob, I will let you know a couple of fun things which I do with my channel.

1825
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,440
You can exclude audio from a VOD.

1826
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:35,440
You can also choose to have it not go to VOD, I think.

1827
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,440
Yeah, that's true.

1828
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:38,440
We could just turn VODs off for that night.

1829
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,440
Yeah.

1830
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:46,440
But I always have, because, you know, I play a playlist in my background that could be any number of copyrighted things.

1831
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:54,440
But you just set your advanced settings to have your audio routing go a slightly different way.

1832
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:59,440
So, you have a VOD track and you have a live track.

1833
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,440
So, it's pretty easy.

1834
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,440
I'll show you.

1835
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:03,440
Maybe, maybe.

1836
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,440
So, okay.

1837
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,440
I mean, I'm open to it.

1838
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:12,440
It would be a fun channel point reward type of thing, which, by the way, we still owe the listeners an Orange Launch Fudio.

1839
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:19,440
We all know why it got delayed, and it got delayed for good reason, but we got to plan a date for that at some point so we can start doing channel point rewards again.

1840
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,440
So, all right.

1841
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:25,440
Anyway, let's see ABBA coming out at some point.

1842
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,440
Will I buy it?

1843
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:27,440
Of course I will.

1844
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:28,440
Okay.

1845
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:33,440
If they release it here, but I think it said it's coming out here as well as Europe and all that, so why wouldn't I get it?

1846
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:34,440
All right.

1847
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:35,440
Let's go to the listener roundtable.

1848
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:44,440
Every week, we invite you to participate, whether it's in Discord over Twitch, or, excuse me, vognetwork.com slash Discord, or via our email bag.

1849
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:48,440
Participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send us an email.

1850
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:50,440
I actually see a caller already in the green room.

1851
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:54,440
So, Dark Soccer, if you don't mind, before we do the mailbag, I'm going to go to our caller here.

1852
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:57,440
So, let's go to our caller.

1853
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,440
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

1854
01:44:58,440 --> 01:44:59,440
Who's this?

1855
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:05,440
Of course, any good discussion about ABBA also includes Erotic and Madonna and all of those sorts of things.

1856
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:10,440
Hey, they've influenced so many people.

1857
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:12,440
It's pretty wild.

1858
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:13,440
You're not kidding.

1859
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,440
VXJ6V.

1860
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,440
Hey, Jason.

1861
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,440
It's good to hear from you.

1862
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:17,440
What's up, my friend?

1863
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:25,440
So, I have a little bit of a mea culpa, and I also wanted to expand on what I said in the intro.

1864
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,440
Okay.

1865
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:34,440
Because 30 seconds, more like 22 with my standard rap and all that kind of stuff.

1866
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:46,440
So, when I did the intro about two hours before showtime, and when I did it as usual, I went through a couple of rewrites, and I had to delete a leading one or two sentences.

1867
01:45:46,440 --> 01:46:02,440
And when I was listening to it in context of the show starting, I was thinking, wow, that scam call out is really, really shitty, really fear-mongery, really just like, where the hell did that come from after what is ostensibly a very good feature that Twitch is working on?

1868
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:05,440
The charity donations, if that wasn't obvious already.

1869
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:12,440
And I wanted to add a few more of my thoughts on why I wrote that the way it is.

1870
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:23,440
The first draft had a leading paragraph that was talking about, I wonder how much scamming I don't know about in charity donation circles.

1871
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:37,440
The couple of versions in particular I'm thinking about that is like, whenever there's a big natural disaster, you have people on the road, I'm collecting for a Red Cross, just on random roads anywhere.

1872
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:46,440
And don't give to those people, give to the Red Cross directly. If there is a location near you, that's great. Obviously, online is everything.

1873
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:56,440
But somebody that paints a Red Cross on a bucket on the side of the road, don't give your money to them. Always, always, always go to the source.

1874
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:09,440
This is a huge thing with charity donations and stuff is that you have to be able to trust, because oftentimes you're donating to somebody's PayPal, and then they're going to take that money and you just have to trust that they donate it.

1875
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:20,440
I've seen some Twitch streamers, what they do is they'll be like, okay, hooray, we raised $85 for this. And then they post a screenshot of their donation to, I mean, we know those can be faked.

1876
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:27,440
But we trust that most people are pretty genuine. But there is that keyword, trust, that's very important.

1877
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:39,440
A lot will have actually a link to the charity that works through Twitch. So you follow the link through the Twitch chat, it takes you to the official donation page.

1878
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,440
Well, I was going to say a lot of-

1879
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,440
Tiltify is one of the big ones I think out there.

1880
01:47:42,440 --> 01:48:00,440
Well, I was also going to point out like the big fundraiser I think we think of with Twitch is Games Done Quick, an awesome Games Done Quick. And when you donate for that, you do donate to a PayPal, but you're donating directly to the Doctors Without Borders PayPal, or the other charity Prevent Cancer Foundation.

1881
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:18,440
You're donating directly to those, basically, but it's tracked on the Games Done Quick website and it sort of ties together. So it knows that you donated through them, but you are putting the money right there in their PayPal, if that makes sense.

1882
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:32,440
Yep. A streamer friend of mine back in 2016 or 2017 wanted to raise money for the RSPCA. She's up in British Columbia. She wanted to donate to the RSPCA.

1883
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:54,440
There was a lot of big news about multiple, just a hoarder houses, I don't remember if they were breeders or not, but like just houses that really fell off the way. And there were hundreds of cats, hundreds of animals across multiple raids and recovery and all that kind of stuff. And she really wanted to donate to the RSPCA.

1884
01:48:54,440 --> 01:49:23,440
And I knew her personally, I was a moderator of her channel. I give her all of the benefit of the doubt, all of us in the community did, we're a tight knit community, all that kind of stuff. And she did also make the donation in person, posed with a staff member with a big novelty check with everything, signed in all of their, all of the commemoration and proof was there, admittedly, after the fact, which is always the problem.

1885
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:45,440
And so that's just kind of like where my mind went. We see all the big news with GDQ, 2 million, 3 million, the number only continues. I wonder about how many chargebacks and stuff that they have to deal with. It's probably a lot. Obviously, they're not really going to report on that. I haven't looked at their full disclosure fundamentals or anything like that.

1886
01:49:46,440 --> 01:50:09,440
But there's a lot of detail out there. And this tugs on a lot of things that I deal with professionally and feel personally and all those sorts of things that know who you're giving to, know why you're giving to them. Don't do it just because they say so. If they say it's going to XYZ Corporation charity, all that kind of stuff, do that.

1887
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:22,440
Another couple of things that I'd like to say, just in general, if you use Amazon, go to smile.amazon.com. Pick a charity, put your money towards a charity.

1888
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,440
Except for AbleGamers.

1889
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:28,440
Yep, I do charity water. I've cared about that for quite some time.

1890
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:30,440
I'm putting all of mine into Abortion Fund.

1891
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:50,440
Yeah, there's a ton of great resources out there. The reason why this is U.S. only, because Twitch is a U.S. company, and the good thing about the U.S. is the 501c3 and c4 registrations, like the legal system is out there for you to be able to look at this information very quickly and very easily.

1892
01:50:51,440 --> 01:51:10,440
Even such that the couple of Twitch Cons that I've gone to when I saw, I don't remember if it was Tiltify, but they had these little, all of the charities in the wing of the main hall of Twitch Con had these little credit card bucket looking things that were donations.

1893
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:25,440
It was like, hey, $1, $5, $10, just drop your card in here. That is an example of technology, awesome technology benefiting people where you come by and boop, we know how to drop a card in, bam.

1894
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:29,440
You get a pleasant little sound, you get the reaction of everybody else there.

1895
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:33,440
Don't give this up to Salvation Army, just saying that.

1896
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:50,440
Agreed, but where your policies and feelings and motives align, do your research so that you're not getting ripped off and benefiting somebody else. The information is out there, please make sure you're making use of it.

1897
01:51:51,440 --> 01:52:01,440
I think this is going to be nice when it is more embedded within Twitch. I think Twitch can see that so much of their community is getting involved with this anyway, that it's just something they should be on top of.

1898
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:12,440
And just to weed out that bad apple in the barrel, because all it takes is one to really ruin it for people that want to question everything after that point. And rightfully so, I get it.

1899
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:24,440
So Twitch being able to kind of like legitimize that by people knowing that it's going to the charity because it's through Twitch and you point out how Twitch already, Amazon owns Twitch and already has the charity stuff built into it.

1900
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:38,440
And yes, use Smile. I mean, I can't tell you which charity to donate to. There's 1000 great causes on Smile Amazon, you have to speak what speaks to you. And that's that no one can tell you what to do, you have to pick the one that's right for you.

1901
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:44,440
But pick somebody if you are using Amazon.

1902
01:52:44,440 --> 01:53:02,440
Be very careful though, because some of them on there, especially like with the ones I've been dealing with for abortion funds, they are very deceptively named. Look them up, look up their paperwork before you select it.

1903
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:28,440
Yeah, so many things like, I don't remember if it was just last February when the Supreme Court decision was leaked. But yeah, those same kind of things as like, when somebody, when some organization's name gets big in the news, you're going to have a bunch of similar looking name pop ups like this, this will always be around because this is always a social problem.

1904
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:38,440
Like the name looks close enough to trick you into giving your money over to something that is scamming you out of your donation, your good intent.

1905
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:59,440
And the more vetted that platforms make it the better it gets us 90% of the way there the last 10% is on the individual to verify and do it and do it the way that really like verifies and proves that you did what you wanted to do to the people you wanted to have your donation.

1906
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:06,440
All right, very good tips, Jason. Appreciate it and appreciate the intro making and all that good stuff as always.

1907
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:07,440
Always, always.

1908
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:10,440
All right. Take care, my friend. We'll talk to you soon.

1909
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:11,440
Have a great night, everyone.

1910
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:12,440
You too.

1911
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:32,440
All right. Let's go back to, not that shot, this one. Let's go back and visit our mailbag. Participate at orangelandtrader.com is the place that you can send us an email week after week after week. Participate at orangelandtrader.com. And I believe there's at least one in there today, right?

1912
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:45,440
There is a list of three things but there's only two items listed but I'll read it. Hello one and all quick story for you. Last night I was at a friend's house for a birthday party at his house there's a DDR third mix machine in the living room.

1913
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:56,440
The only difference is that there's a computer attached to it with step mania I was asked by someone to join them for a few rounds, played 1.5 Difficult. The machine has tons of custom original tracks, including other DDR mixes.

1914
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:08,440
I don't remember all the songs I played, but it did get me to thinking, and a question to all of you, what three songs would you play in DDR? Here's my choices. So number one isn't on the list, I'm just saying.

1915
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:22,440
Number two, Princes of the Universe by Queen and number three, nonfiction by Liella. Kind of eclectic, but I like it. That's it. Stay cool. Really hating this heatwave and stay awesome. That came from Ranchan.

1916
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:24,440
Always good to hear from Ranchan.

1917
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:42,440
Gosh, my three. They're probably all on my playlist. I would probably say Days of Thunder by The Midnight.

1918
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:47,440
I'd also say maybe Stars by Kylie.

1919
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:50,440
One of my favorite songs.

1920
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:02,440
Maybe Star Worshipper, the Leno remix by Future Cop.

1921
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:08,440
I'm also going to throw in one another and say Money by Mystery Skulls.

1922
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:20,440
This is a really hard one for me because my brain kind of wants to go back to that era of DDR music in the 90s and 2000s and kind of pick songs in that area.

1923
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:29,440
Well, we never did get an ABBA song officially in DDR, so you know I want Dancing Queen in DDR. So there's that.

1924
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:49,440
Let's see. What else would I love to see in DDR? I would love to see something like, there's a lot of, see when I go back to that era, I'm like I wanted more like Vincent D'Amour stuff because like Ghost is probably like one of my all time favorite songs or more echo image songs because there's a lot of echo image stuff, you know, but it's kind of like more of the same that was already in DDR.

1925
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:56,440
So I guess I go and I say like, I would love to have a bop from Robin, you know, has always had some danceable songs.

1926
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:59,440
Something for Robin and Roiksop.

1927
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:15,440
Yeah, I was just actually Roiksop was another band I was gonna say I would love to have a song by them. Yeah, so I don't know or like, yeah, I think there's so many good songs that would work out but it all depends on what they can license right?

1928
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:22,440
Yeah, Roiksop and how you pronounce your name, Sundafar? Never Ever?

1929
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:23,440
Yeah, yeah.

1930
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:24,440
That would be a good one too.

1931
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:31,440
They just had a new album come out too, Roiksop did so because they have a Goldfrapp song on there now.

1932
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:35,440
So we know how we like Goldfrapp.

1933
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,440
Absolutely, I love Goldfrapp.

1934
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:42,440
So Loki, what about you? What three songs did you put in DDR?

1935
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:54,440
I don't know. I have a DDR machine that can put any songs I want on there. Like, I don't really know what I would put on there. That's, that's, that's too open ended. Like, I'll just play some of the stuff that other people make.

1936
01:57:54,440 --> 01:58:03,440
I would do a DDR machine where the only song you can play is conga feeling. That's it. It's a conga feeling machine. That's the only song you're allowed to play.

1937
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:11,440
What was that day back on a fourth mix at RVGL where I think someone played like the kick, either kick the can or the seven jump over and over?

1938
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,440
I think it was the seven jump.

1939
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:13,440
Usually kick the can.

1940
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:14,440
Yeah.

1941
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:16,440
That was special.

1942
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,440
Good times.

1943
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:24,440
Uh, SG100Matt is suggesting Loki fusion mixes. You, you had some really awesome mixes back in the day. I kind of miss that you.

1944
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:27,440
Yeah, they don't make great sim files though, unfortunately.

1945
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,440
Did you ever put them on YouTube? You should put those on YouTube.

1946
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,440
Uh, no.

1947
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:31,440
Just put them up there.

1948
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,440
They would probably get claimed pretty fast.

1949
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:37,440
So let them claim. Uh, I guess you wouldn't want to do it on your Minecraft channel because you're really trying to build that.

1950
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:38,440
No.

1951
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:40,440
Have a second. Have a throwaway account.

1952
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:43,440
Sure.

1953
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:48,440
All right. Um, okay. So thank you for the email. Appreciate that. That was the only one, right?

1954
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:49,440
Yeah.

1955
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:59,440
Okay. So we can go to our, uh, chat and get some questions from our chat as well. So no one special is back. Hello. Hello. And says question.

1956
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:10,440
Have you three ever bought a game going in knowing full well it's bad, but enjoyed it nonetheless? That's an interesting one.

1957
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:16,440
Have you ever bought a game knowing it would be bad, but still enjoying it nonetheless?

1958
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:25,440
I feel like if I bought it and everybody said it was bad, it was something I was still wanting to defend.

1959
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:29,440
Um, no, I definitely have bought games that I know are bad.

1960
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,440
Sneak King comes to mind.

1961
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:34,440
No, no, that's not bad. We talked about it. That's a great game.

1962
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:37,440
Everybody said it was bad when it came out.

1963
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,440
It's creepy.

1964
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:39,440
Yeah. Sneak King.

1965
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:40,440
It's not bad.

1966
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,440
Bobby agrees with me. Just said it in chat.

1967
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:52,440
Uh, no, like I've definitely purchased Steam games because I knew they were bad. Like, um, the long drive.

1968
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:58,440
There's a perfect example. Uh, the gas station simulator.

1969
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:02,440
Pixel Poops volume two.

1970
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,440
Yeah, exactly. You know.

1971
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:12,440
Let's see. Naughty Bear says pod culture. That's a good answer. I remember that one.

1972
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:26,440
Um, I, I can't think of any that I played on purpose that they were bad because I mean, some games other people may not like and you think that they're super fun. So no perception.

1973
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:32,440
No Man's Sky. Everybody shit on that game when it came out and I didn't, I didn't hate it. I didn't love it.

1974
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:40,440
But now I love it, you know, all this time later. But I feel like that's a cheaty answer because you could say, I could say that with a lot of games where they got shit on when they first came out.

1975
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:52,440
Diablo three, Final Fantasy 14, but they're, they're good games now. Right? So those would all fit into that as well. Pod culture says Yaris. I'm sorry. Nobody actually liked Yaris.

1976
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:58,440
You didn't purchase that. That was free.

1977
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:14,440
Um, S. Joe and Hunter Matt says Garfield go, even though it was free to play. I, you know what? A mobile phone game could absolutely count. I bet there's hella mobile phone games that get a shitty rap, but people enjoy them anyway. For sure. So.

1978
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:18,440
A lot of the Earth Defense Force games could be really bad.

1979
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:29,440
Yeah. Um, Oh, Tiger Claw and chat says they were a lot of NES games that were bad, but we bought them because you looked at the box and admire the graphics. So you thought it would be a good game.

1980
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:32,440
Back to the future two and three. That was an awful game.

1981
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:36,440
I remember everybody hated Festers Quest, but I kind of liked it.

1982
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:37,440
And it was great.

1983
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:44,440
It didn't click for me for years later that I was like, Festers Quest was just the overhead parts of Blaster Master as a game.

1984
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:52,440
If Festers Quest was just the overhead parts of Blaster Master, they took out the side scroll part and they took all the overhead part and made it its own game.

1985
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:58,440
So yeah, it's just basically Festers Quest is a sequel to Blaster Master.

1986
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:01,440
It's in the same universe.

1987
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,440
It's in the same universe as well. Yes, it is.

1988
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:09,440
Bobby Blackwell says, I'm surprised Loki didn't say Saints Row 4. Well, Loki didn't like that game.

1989
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:14,440
I didn't buy that knowing it was bad. I bought it and then found out it was bad.

1990
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:25,440
All right. If you have any other questions for us, twitch.tv slash vog network, I'll give it another minute here to see if any other questions come in here.

1991
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:28,440
But I remember the wrestling game so bad that when we rented it, we took it back.

1992
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:30,440
That was that WCW thunder.

1993
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:39,440
Oh, God. Yeah, I remember renting games that would end up being terrible, but you just I never I mean, I was bad enough.

1994
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:44,440
We took it back. It was my mom never liked Blockbuster for some reason.

1995
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:46,440
My mom, because all these people have fond memories of Blockbuster.

1996
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:49,440
My mom refused to go there. She hated them for some reason.

1997
02:02:49,440 --> 02:03:00,440
So I never really got to experience that. We did go to Hollywood video, but I don't think I ever but it was always like mom and pop stores like the local chain Plaster TV.

1998
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:02,440
We went to for a long time. They didn't rent games, though.

1999
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:09,440
We had a Curtis Mathis store in Dothan, Alabama, that my granny would take us to for rentals.

2000
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:11,440
That's fun. Yeah.

2001
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:17,440
I think I rented the same copy of Return of the Jedi over and over and over and over because it is my favorite Star Wars flick.

2002
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:19,440
Nice. Nice.

2003
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:27,440
Let's see. Mike Deff says, What about the opposite games that everyone likes that you hate?

2004
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,440
Oh, this is.

2005
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:33,440
A game that everyone likes that you don't like.

2006
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:37,440
Halo. I don't I don't like Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask.

2007
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,440
I don't like it. You went right for it.

2008
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:42,440
You I don't like any Nintendo 64 or Zelda games.

2009
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:44,440
Wow.

2010
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:47,440
I'm sure there's something in there.

2011
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,440
There's something in there.

2012
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,440
There's something in there.

2013
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,440
There's something in there.

2014
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:55,440
There's something in there.

2015
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:57,440
There's something in there.

2016
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:59,440
I'm sure there's something.

2017
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,440
I don't know why I'm drawing a blank in the minute.

2018
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:07,440
See, I want to take the easy answers and do things like Madden and the sports games, but I feel like that's a cop out.

2019
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:10,440
Oh, oh,

2020
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:13,440
Saga Frontier.

2021
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:18,440
I never liked that. I don't like the Saga series and people really like that.

2022
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:21,440
And I did like it. Yeah, I was like, it's suicide.

2023
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,440
It's like, oh, Square Enix game.

2024
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:30,440
I played them like, oh, no, I'm kind of with the folks in chat saying the Souls games, the soul.

2025
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:33,440
Yeah. Oh, oh, any of the tactics games?

2026
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:38,440
I don't like tactics games, including I don't like Final Fantasy Tactics tactics games.

2027
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:41,440
See, that's the one I'll let slide.

2028
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:44,440
But otherwise, I'm not a big fan of this way.

2029
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:52,440
I don't even like the Macross game that came out on PC Engine and I love almost anything of the old Macross games.

2030
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:53,440
So.

2031
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:59,440
All right. Well, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap things up tonight.

2032
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:01,440
I know it was a little shorter tonight, but that's all right.

2033
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:04,440
I'm still kind of feeling like I'm ready to to wrap up for the night.

2034
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:07,440
So that'll work. But thank you all for being here.

2035
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:11,440
Thank you for listening to the show, whether you were here live or you joined us on the podcast feed.

2036
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:15,440
Thank you so much for downloading and checking out Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

2037
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:19,440
If you like what you heard on the show, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2038
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:22,440
Excuse me, help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2039
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:25,440
but the voices have to be here for us to put out on air.

2040
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:30,440
So please tell a friend or two a tweet or social media post goes a long way.

2041
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:35,440
I really appreciate that. Even hosting, even though hosting on Twitch is kind of not what it used to be.

2042
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:39,440
We'll still take them here at Vogue Network and I really appreciate that stuff.

2043
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:41,440
So thank you. Thank you.

2044
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:44,440
We'll be back in seven days to do it again.

2045
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:46,440
I guess we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2046
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,440
Oh, actually, I should check with Loki. I'm sorry. Last minute stories.

2047
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:51,440
I forgot to sidebar it, but do you have any last minute stories, Loki?

2048
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:53,440
Uh, no.

2049
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:55,440
OK, then we will get final thoughts.

2050
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:58,440
All right, DarkSakura, your final thoughts, because I know you're going to stream.

2051
02:05:58,440 --> 02:06:02,440
Um, yeah, words.

2052
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:03,440
OK.

2053
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:05,440
Later taters.

2054
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:06,440
Bye.

2055
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:08,440
I couldn't think of anything. Sorry.

2056
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:11,440
No, you're fine. It's only a segment we do every week. No, I'm just kidding.

2057
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:16,440
Yeah, but my brain is like, I'm looking at a freeze frame of midnight and I'm like, I love my cat.

2058
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:18,440
That's it. I love my cat.

2059
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:19,440
There you go. There you go.

2060
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:20,440
Yeah.

2061
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:22,440
All right. Have a good stream. We'll see a little bit later.

2062
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:26,440
All right. And Loki, I actually how about my final thought?

2063
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:31,440
My final thought is I would like to know what fucking went and changed all the settings on my computer,

2064
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:35,440
including these different shots I'd carefully curated within OBS.

2065
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:39,440
And just tonight, it just decided to reset all my shots and make them square.

2066
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:43,440
So now I'm having to like a dummy recraft them as we're live on air.

2067
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,440
But whatever. Anyway, that's my final thought.

2068
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:50,440
Why do why do things have to be complicated? Why can't things just work?

2069
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:52,440
Why can't they work? All right.

2070
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:54,440
It's I guess.

2071
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:57,440
Loki, last but not least, your final thought.

2072
02:06:57,440 --> 02:07:02,440
I wish there was some files for the dance or the step maniac stuff.

2073
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:05,440
I get it. It's Kyle Ward and all them.

2074
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:08,440
And they want to support that because it's a great indie game.

2075
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:09,440
It's doing well.

2076
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:10,440
But.

2077
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:13,440
But also, I want to play them on my cabinet.

2078
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:16,440
And so, yeah.

2079
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,440
All right.

2080
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:18,440
I want them.

2081
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:19,440
All right.

2082
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:20,440
I'll pay for them.

2083
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:26,440
I like you can't tell me that that I'm sure that Kevin is running like step mania and some.

2084
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:30,440
You know, capacity is like, you know, just offer them.

2085
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:33,440
It will pay for them.

2086
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:38,440
All right. We'll be back in seven days to do this all over again.

2087
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:42,440
Why did the date suddenly revert to our 20th anniversary show?

2088
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:44,440
Everything is broken on this computer.

2089
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:48,440
Everything is broken. I'm done. Shut it down. Shut it down.

2090
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:51,440
See you in seven days. Bye.

2091
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:55,440
