This week, ZeniMax enters the crunch culture conversation with accusations against management over working employees. Head of Xbox Game Studios, Matt Butte disputes the accusations with accurate deflection and lack of emphasis on the important details, rightly stating that the reports were about Fallout 76 and Skyrim, which Xbox Game Studios had no organizational ownership stake in. But there's more. I can't read the whole article in this intro.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.360
But your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki will bring you more details on this and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.760
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week with my co-hosts say hello and say wow wig to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:09.000 --> 01:09.920
What do you mean wig?

01:10.440 --> 01:12.640
This is your real hair? You don't wear wigs?

01:13.400 --> 01:31.160
I got I got no it's not my real hair. I would not be blonde on purpose except via a wig. Although I mean, I'm actually rather surprised at how well the blonde works. I never thought that I would be I would look okay as blonde.

01:31.640 --> 01:47.160
If I knew you were gonna wear a wig tonight, I would have worn a wig too. But the only wig I have is my Yvette wig from when I played Yvette and Clue a few months ago. So it would have been a little, little, little silly, but fun. So maybe next time.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.040
How about I loan you some of my you know, three dozen wigs.

01:53.160 --> 02:01.280
Sounds good. At some point, we'll have a wig night. And I'd love to see how tech master Loki would respond to wig night. Hi, Loki.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.360
Don't own any wigs. So that can't work.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.720
Well, DarkSakura has a collection.

02:05.720 --> 02:11.440
I just offered to loan wigs out. I'll give you something like in a steel blue.

02:12.160 --> 02:17.440
Would you would you at least consider doing like one of those stupid hats with a built in mullet or something?

02:18.840 --> 02:19.360
Sure.

02:20.000 --> 02:20.560
Okay, yeah.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.520
There we go. Hat mullet.

02:21.760 --> 02:29.360
That's, that's about as close as we're gonna get Loki to do that. Hello. Hello. What's the gameplay behind you tonight, Loki?

02:29.880 --> 02:34.840
It's I think called in the deep. It looks like metal slug, but with a submarine.

02:34.920 --> 02:38.760
I was gonna say it looks like something out of like the Genesis era. But okay, like a Neo Geo.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.520
It's an arcade game.

02:40.600 --> 02:46.160
Oh, okay. I like that. Very cool. Orange right in chat says in the hunt is what that is.

02:46.200 --> 02:50.400
Oh, is in the hunt. My mistake. I couldn't see it behind my head. So

02:51.680 --> 02:57.400
I had the the name like, I had it. You remembered a second ago, but like I couldn't see it.

02:57.560 --> 03:09.480
All good. And of course, the comments coming in live because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six six o'clock Pacific at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash v o g network or voice of geeks network.

03:10.080 --> 03:21.200
Nine Eastern six Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, Bobby back tonight after his trip over to summer games done quick, which he talked a lot about on his show tonight.

03:21.200 --> 03:38.040
So obviously, I'm going to give his show a plug. He talked a little bit about kind of what it was like to be there in person, because even though he's been involved with summer games done, or excuse me, with the games done quick organization since 2020 as a volunteer, for obvious reasons, this is the first time that he was able to go live and in person.

03:38.280 --> 03:57.000
And it was also very interesting to me as a bystander just seeing how seriously they took precautions at GDQ. Holy goodness. And one story I'll spoil from Bobby show is he was saying that there was a nurses convention that was happening at the exact same hotel out there in the think of the Minneapolis area.

03:57.000 --> 04:23.400
There was a nurses convention happening on the ground floor, and they were upstairs or something. And that the mass compliance at games done quick was better than the nurses convention where it sounds like it was slim to none from what it sounds like. So that is pretty interesting. And then you see the arcade and everything spaced out. So that's that's the way to have a convention right now in 2022. Are you listening Anime Expo? I don't think they are

04:23.840 --> 04:32.840
that that's very interesting. The max policy. But what I really want to know is if anybody made the joke when the nurses walked by and said, Hello, nurse.

04:33.720 --> 05:02.480
I'm sure somebody had to, I would hope I would have. See, SSU 100 Mountain Chat says, Yeah, summer games done quick won't be a super spreader, but the detractors won't listen. There's just gonna be people that you kind of have to look at it that the pandemic has affected people in many ways. And major distrust of crowds of people is a pretty big thing for a lot of people at this point. And there's a part of me that kind of gets it. I kind of think on

05:02.480 --> 05:32.160
social media, people kind of have a blank check to run wild. Sometimes, I think there is a line that has to be walked for many people. Like I went to Dragon Con last year. I went in part for the mental health component. Like I there's a lot about the in person and seeing the people that I really needed back in my life. And the fact that Dragon Con took the stuff seriously and you know, had the requirements they did and had pretty decent compliance, I'd say about like 90 95% compliance. And most people I saw was wearing

05:32.160 --> 06:01.760
masks and stuff. It did. It wasn't a super spreader event. And I guarantee you games done quick is not going to be a spreader event of any sort. Yeah, some people had COVID. But like they brought it in from like having already been sick or it was the fucking flights. Because if anything is a super spreader event, it's airplanes right now. So I would say that games done quick was really a lesson from what I'm observing and how to do this shit right moving forward. And I'm fairly confident the number of COVID

06:01.760 --> 06:17.080
cases that were transmitted at games done quick are going to be slim to none. And if they're slim, it's going to be because like so and so and so and so went to Arby's together outside the hotel or whatever. And it was that sort of thing and not at the actual convention. So

06:17.080 --> 06:38.960
um, this is your 100. Matt and chat says I went to magfest for the same reasons. We all have to just live our lives the best and comfortably as we can just have to assume everyone will do all the right things going in and afterwards. Yeah, I mean, the the opportunity to rid the world of COVID past, we failed, society failed to get rid of COVID when they could. So now it's

06:40.080 --> 06:43.240
I will say that I don't think there was any getting rid of it anyway.

06:43.240 --> 06:55.600
Probably not. Just to the just to the nature of Coronaviruses themselves. It did exactly what it was expected to do, which is evolve, and become weaker.

06:55.600 --> 07:25.600
And, you know, I, I think you kind of look at the areas that were doing COVID precautions really well, like New Zealand, let's say, you know, in the beginning, they were doing really well. But now it's kind of hit the point where it's like they're kind of in the same boat as everyone else. And that's just what it is now. And it sucks. I don't mean to sound complacent with it. But thank gosh, the science has evolved in two and a half years, because I think we've been able to make a lot of progress and how to treat how to, you know, you know, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid of COVID, how to get rid

07:25.600 --> 07:55.600
of COVID, how to vaccinate, you know, and all this other stuff. It's just vaccine has that kind of invokes that most people feel vaccines prevent diseases, because the vaccines that you get as a kid for months, rubella, most of us got vaccinated as a kid, and it was not a big fucking deal at all, because everybody knew these diseases were serious, you get vaccinated, you don't get them, you get the vaccine, you don't get them. And I think it causes a mental thing with a lot of people because like you get a vaccine, but you can still get this. But it's just the

07:55.600 --> 08:25.600
vaccines help mitigate the damage, right? So I don't know. Maybe I'm not one to speak on it because I still have not had COVID as far as I know. Maybe I've had it and I'm unaware. Hmm. Remember the thing with COVID is exactly like getting the flu shot. It's going to be that you are vaccinated against that strain of it. And with an illness that's constantly mutating, the vaccines are working against the

08:25.600 --> 08:55.600
strain they're created for. Yes. I run, ironically, in many ways, COVID is the flu now. How ironic, but obviously, there are differences. I don't mean to draw a little alignment still. Yeah, the flu can kill people. Yeah, yeah. A cold can kill people, you know, and a cold is, again, another kind of Coronavirus. So people need to look back and and not simplify the science of it.

08:55.600 --> 09:25.600
And look at the big picture. It's something that one has to pay attention to holistically. Yeah. And although now there there's a research thinking that they know what's causing long COVID and how to combat that. That's great. And that's that's the type of advances that are going to help people be more comfortable when weighing the risk. Because let's be real, I'm going to go to Dragon Con this year. I'm already scheduled for four panels. And it's very likely being where Dragon Con is, there's probably not going to be a lot of

09:25.600 --> 09:55.600
precautions this year. I'm hopeful that there will be. There's probably not going to be. So I'm going to Twitch Con. Yeah, same thing, right? And it's like, well, I'm masking. Yeah, Twitch being in, yeah, and masks will always be optional. And that's probably something I'll still continue to do at Dragon Con. And yeah, Twitch Con might be able to do some weird things. But also the way things are in October, even Labor Day, the way things are then versus the way they are now, this thing changes on a on a daily basis, you know,

09:55.600 --> 10:25.600
it's it's wild. Bobby in chat says, all this talking about Summer Games Done Quick and his participation in that has been great for my mental health. I wasn't doing well in late 2020. I was medically healthy, but not mentally healthy. I'm both medically and mentally healthy right now. And I from the mental health perspective, I can speak in a similar place. I was not in a great place either in 2020. Mentally, I'm doing better. But then I had this whole interesting type two diabetes thing that I've had to

10:25.600 --> 10:55.600
deal with, which I, I don't know, like, again, I am convinced the vast majority of diabetes is genetic period, you have to be disposed genetically to have this. But I think there is a certain element of element of it that was rushed because of the depression I had in 2020 in dealing with the pandemic. So there there are also with type two diabetes, genetics are a big component of it because my family has a disposition. But also diet and lifestyle do play a very large

10:55.600 --> 11:25.600
factor in it. Yeah. And both of those things were shit in 2020 and 2021. And thankfully, I was diagnosed right around the time things started to get better at like, because it was a month after Dragon Con. So I was able to make the changes I needed to make. And you know, what am I how many pounds am I down today? I think 52 pounds is how many how much weight I've lost so far on this, which, you know, you lost all those pounds. Is there a joke you're setting up here?

11:25.600 --> 11:55.600
Because I found them all.

11:55.600 --> 12:25.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

12:25.600 --> 12:55.600
Yeah, yeah

12:55.600 --> 13:25.600
Yeah, yeah

13:25.600 --> 13:55.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

13:55.600 --> 13:56.600
Yeah.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.980
Actually, I'll go ahead and go on record. I gained back about five pounds.

13:59.980 --> 14:00.980
Okay, that's-

14:00.980 --> 14:13.920
But I've also, now I haven't been in a good place for like the last few months. But I

14:13.920 --> 14:15.660
have been lifting my weights again.

14:15.660 --> 14:16.660
Good.

14:16.660 --> 14:23.900
And there's just something about making yourself sore that's a little cathartic. It's like,

14:23.900 --> 14:27.580
take that body. You're gonna feel better and you're gonna like it.

14:27.580 --> 14:28.580
Yeah.

14:28.580 --> 14:29.580
So-

14:29.580 --> 14:30.580
It was-

14:30.580 --> 14:33.820
And then I get to walk around like a badass when I'm done.

14:33.820 --> 14:38.720
Forcing myself to go that first mile and interrupt my day to do it was the hardest step and then

14:38.720 --> 14:45.360
everything was kind of downhill from there. So anyway, let's talk about games because

14:45.360 --> 14:50.780
believe it or not, it is a gaming podcast. So when we're sick, we play a lot of video

14:50.780 --> 14:56.220
games while we're trying to recover. Let's talk about what's happened in the gaming world

14:56.220 --> 15:02.400
this week. Actually, quick first, sorry. I do want to just say thank you everybody for

15:02.400 --> 15:07.700
a really wonderful show last week, celebrating our 20th anniversary. We had a little bit

15:07.700 --> 15:13.120
of a typical show because we really just spent the entire three and a half plus hours is

15:13.120 --> 15:19.980
what it clocked in as, talking about us. And not just us, but the last 20 years of gaming

15:19.980 --> 15:24.820
history, our show and everything we've kind of seen over the last 20 years, the good,

15:24.820 --> 15:29.580
bad, and the ugly, all of it. And I really want to thank everybody for participating

15:29.580 --> 15:34.660
in that show. Not just my co-host of course, but just everybody in the Twitch chat and

15:34.660 --> 15:38.560
so forth. And I'm sure many of you that listen on the podcast feed as well, thank you for

15:38.560 --> 15:42.760
checking it out. And I've seen some tweets and things like that. So just thank you. We

15:42.760 --> 15:46.480
will get to some more towards the end of the show tonight because we never did emails last

15:46.480 --> 15:50.820
week. And we never did tweets or any of that stuff. So I want to do some of that tonight.

15:50.820 --> 15:55.080
But we'll get to that later in the show. But I just want to say thank you. And here we

15:55.080 --> 16:01.520
go, year 21. So Loki, why don't you start us off with a wrap up of kind of the big headline

16:01.520 --> 16:02.520
from the week, right?

16:02.520 --> 16:07.740
Yeah, so it was a partner showcase for the Nintendo Direct Mini. So they were showing

16:07.740 --> 16:12.440
off a bunch of different third party games. So some of the different trailers that they

16:12.440 --> 16:19.720
had Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak, which is going to that came out on June 30.

16:19.720 --> 16:23.560
Do you know something? You have something weird Monster Hunter Sunbreak though. I'm

16:23.560 --> 16:27.920
going to say this because I've seen Shane tweeting about it. And he's right. Not a lot

16:27.920 --> 16:33.740
of people are noticing this, that amiibo figure that was supposed to come out that was like

16:33.740 --> 16:39.440
a GameStop exclusive here in the US. I think it did come out in Europe and Japan. It didn't

16:39.440 --> 16:44.860
show up here after all. And it is suddenly disappeared from the website. Even talking

16:44.860 --> 16:49.180
about the collector's edition or whatever it was did come with an amiibo. But the collector's

16:49.180 --> 16:54.020
edition even advertises these other amiibo. You can't get them in the US. And like it's

16:54.020 --> 16:59.800
not being reported on in the media. Because I guess there's no headline to copy paste.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.700
But I thought that was very interesting. What Shane kind of brought light to there because

17:03.700 --> 17:07.200
he's big on the Monster Hunter series and amiibo collecting and he was like, Do you

17:07.200 --> 17:11.640
know these things just disappeared completely? And GameStop never got them in and they're

17:11.640 --> 17:15.280
not going to. I thought that was very interesting. Anyway, sorry.

17:15.280 --> 17:22.280
Maybe they'll probably just like suddenly come out later on without any fanfare.

17:22.280 --> 17:29.160
Hopefully not an exclusive to one store because I'm never a fan of that. But yeah, yeah.

17:29.160 --> 17:35.720
So what else? We had the Nier Automata, the end of a Euro edition, which is going to be

17:35.720 --> 17:39.480
including all the DLC kind of your Game of the Year edition type thing.

17:39.480 --> 17:43.720
That's impressive that they got Nier Automata running on the Switch. I mean, but at the

17:43.720 --> 17:50.840
same time, it was a PS4 Xbox One game and that is about the power in the Switch. So

17:50.840 --> 17:55.400
it's not too surprising, but it's still neat.

17:55.400 --> 18:03.320
Yep. This weird looking game that's Lorelei and the laser eyes.

18:03.320 --> 18:11.040
It's a puzzle game by the devs who did Sayonara Wild Hearts and that's coming out next year.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.440
This is surprising because I think we were just joking about it the other day about like,

18:14.440 --> 18:19.440
oh, Konami is not doing anything with their properties. Super Bomberman R2 is coming

18:19.440 --> 18:21.240
out now on the Nintendo Switch.

18:21.240 --> 18:25.360
I'm glad the one release that worked out for them, they're going to make a sequel to.

18:25.360 --> 18:30.280
Yeah. So that's the retro collections have done very well. So I shouldn't speak too much

18:30.280 --> 18:35.040
out of turn. I'm glad they're one like new thing is getting a sequel.

18:35.040 --> 18:41.080
Something that came out of nowhere, Megaman Battle Network Legacy Collection. So it's

18:41.080 --> 18:46.160
a collection of 10 of the was that they were portable games, if I remember correctly, for

18:46.160 --> 18:48.200
the Gameboy Advance.

18:48.200 --> 18:52.520
I could hear Ranma celebrating all the way out here when that got announced. But that

18:52.520 --> 18:57.960
is a really cool announcement. I mean, it is it's in the same kind of family as, you

18:57.960 --> 19:02.120
know, they did a Megaman one through six collection and I think it was seven through

19:02.120 --> 19:05.240
10. And I think that didn't they do the X Games at some point? They put all that in

19:05.240 --> 19:10.840
a collection too. And so I think this is like, what else can we squeeze out of Megaman into

19:10.840 --> 19:11.840
a collection?

19:11.840 --> 19:16.640
But Capcom is also pretty big on these collection games lately, right? Fighters collection just

19:16.640 --> 19:18.440
came out not that long ago, right?

19:18.440 --> 19:21.400
It's making the money. It's probably a very minimal effort.

19:21.400 --> 19:27.640
It is. And also, they've been pretty decent collections, all things considered. So, yeah,

19:27.640 --> 19:29.960
I think that the that's exciting about that.

19:29.960 --> 19:35.960
DJ Ranma S is actually in chat and says, I lost my proverbial shit at work. Seriously.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.240
So cannot wait.

19:37.240 --> 19:44.280
Ooh, good call from Orange, right? Who says one more step towards the Legends collection.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.280
I hope that

19:45.280 --> 19:50.480
Hardly a collection with two games. Or I guess there's misadventures of Tron Bonn. But like,

19:50.480 --> 19:51.480
yeah,

19:51.480 --> 19:53.480
put Tron Bonn in there too.

19:53.480 --> 19:54.480
Three.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.320
Sure.

19:56.320 --> 20:00.320
Hey, you know what? It's enough to grab a headline.

20:00.320 --> 20:10.400
Sure. What else? We have the Pac-Man World Repack, which I don't know if that's a new

20:10.400 --> 20:11.400
game.

20:11.400 --> 20:20.160
It's a remaster of game. Yeah. Complete with Pac-Mom instead of Ms. Pac-Man. Because Pac-Man

20:20.160 --> 20:22.640
got a new woman.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.640
Pac-Mom.

20:23.640 --> 20:34.120
Uh, there's a game called Blank, which is like this kind of monochrome. It almost looks

20:34.120 --> 20:40.880
like, you know, without yeah, it kind of the the art style reminds me a little bit of Calvin

20:40.880 --> 20:46.520
and Hobbes. But, you know, obviously not Calvin and Hobbes. And that's coming out on the switch

20:46.520 --> 20:49.800
February 2023. They had

20:49.800 --> 20:54.280
a quick comment. Sorry, from Elliot B. in our chat who says, by the way, good to see

20:54.280 --> 20:55.760
you, who says, I always

20:55.760 --> 21:00.600
Oh, I thought it was Blonk. Like white.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.600
Yeah.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
I'm sorry.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.600
I thought you said blank.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.600
Oh.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.600
No. Blonk.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.600
Okay.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.160
Elliot B. in our chat says, I always wanted to check out Battle Network when I had a GBA.

21:11.160 --> 21:15.640
It always looks so cool. Yeah. And you know what? There are 10 games in that collection.

21:15.640 --> 21:19.480
Now granted, it's a little bit of fuzzy math because like they started to do the Pokemon

21:19.480 --> 21:24.100
thing where there's like, you know, red and blue. But still, I think there's six, six

21:24.100 --> 21:27.840
truly unique games in that series. And so that's a pretty meaty collection that they're

21:27.840 --> 21:34.520
putting together there, which is pretty cool. Also, talking about the Pac-Man, DGRama-esque

21:34.520 --> 21:40.360
says Pac-MILF is the new mommy in the game there. So sure. All right.

21:40.360 --> 21:45.880
I thought it, but I didn't say it because, you know, that's ridiculous.

21:45.880 --> 21:50.160
I know. Anyway, moving on. Other announcements from Nintendo Direct.

21:50.160 --> 21:54.640
Return to Monkey Island is going to be coming to the Switch as well. So we basically same

21:54.640 --> 22:00.780
trailer that's been shown already. I'm very much looking forward to that. We have Mario

22:00.780 --> 22:08.040
plus Rabbids Sparks of Hope, and they teased that Bowser is going to be in this as well.

22:08.040 --> 22:15.360
So that's pretty neat. That's coming out in October. Little Noah Sign of Paradise, which

22:15.360 --> 22:24.080
is an RPG by the folks who made Dragalia Lost. This game called Rail Grade, which

22:24.080 --> 22:29.920
is, I guess, a, I don't know, it's like a survival game with a train. It's kind of neat

22:29.920 --> 22:40.480
looking. RPG Time, The Legend of Wright. And this is coming out on August 18th. It's like

22:40.480 --> 22:45.920
a hand-drawn characters. Almost looks like, remember how we saw the other storybook game,

22:45.920 --> 22:52.700
but I think less, you know, the hand-drawn stuff, more kind of like, oh, like Papercraft

22:52.700 --> 23:03.080
almost looking. And then Sonic Frontiers coming to the Switch. Cool. That game we saw, I think

23:03.080 --> 23:14.660
this was, this may have been during Key 3, but Disney Dreamlight Valley. It's that free

23:14.660 --> 23:20.960
to play game. I think that's coming out. That's kind of like the Sims almost. So that's going

23:20.960 --> 23:29.160
to be out September 6th. Live Live got a demo, if I remember correctly, and that's also coming

23:29.160 --> 23:36.200
out here in a few weeks. I need you to grab that. I forgot to grab that. Doraemon Story

23:36.200 --> 23:43.240
of Seasons, Friends of the Great Kingdom. That's pretty cool again. And that's apparently

23:43.240 --> 23:49.180
a sequel to the Doraemon Story of Seasons game. And that's coming out later this year.

23:49.180 --> 23:53.960
We had a trailer for Minecraft Legends again, and that's, you know, obviously coming out

23:53.960 --> 24:01.360
later this year as well. Dragon Quest Treasures, which is a spinoff of the Dragon Quest series

24:01.360 --> 24:05.640
that has treasure hunting in it. I mean, I think we could figure that out based on the

24:05.640 --> 24:11.360
title and that's coming out December 9th of this year. Well, Dragon Quest has had success

24:11.360 --> 24:16.500
with the Builders spinoff, so I'm not surprised that it's kind of, it's interesting that it's

24:16.500 --> 24:19.680
following a very similar thing with Minecraft where it's all these different spinoff games

24:19.680 --> 24:25.920
all of a sudden, but it's cool. I'd check it out. Yeah, it's like a, I don't know if it's like a

24:25.920 --> 24:29.960
loot RPG type thing or something like that. They don't really show much in the trailer,

24:29.960 --> 24:35.640
but. Portal Companion Collection. Sorry, Darktids uses, I think they announced Treasures

24:35.640 --> 24:40.280
previously. I think it's a Dragon Quest XI spinoff. I had no idea. I missed it. Somehow it wasn't on

24:40.280 --> 24:46.560
my radar. Too many games, not enough time. The Portal Companion Collection with Portal 1 and 2.

24:46.600 --> 24:52.680
That's going to be coming out, I think later this year. Oh no, I'm sorry. That was out today. That

24:52.680 --> 24:58.400
was one of those, it's out today. Well, it was out like 15 years ago, but sure, sure. Why not

24:58.400 --> 25:02.840
on the Switch? Well, it's out today on the Switch. They're classic games. Why not? It's not real

25:02.840 --> 25:11.960
gaming until you play it on Switch. Harvest Della, which is, I guess, a similar game to

25:12.280 --> 25:18.800
Rune Factory. And that's supposed to be coming out on the Switch November 4th. I mean, definitely

25:18.800 --> 25:28.720
the imagery and the graphics look a lot like Rune Factory. Persona 5 Royale is, I guess,

25:28.720 --> 25:35.240
a remaster that's coming out on October 21st. And of course, there's also supposed to be ports

25:35.240 --> 25:39.240
for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden, which I think we talked about those before. I

25:39.480 --> 25:46.480
may have been on the Xbox announcement. And that's, I think, it. Well, that was still a lot of

25:46.480 --> 25:54.000
stuff. You just ran through there really quick. But yeah, that was a pretty packed direct. You

25:54.000 --> 25:58.880
know, they made sure to clarify it was all third party stuff. So, we know we weren't going to see

25:58.880 --> 26:02.280
things like Breath of the Wild 2 or anything like that, although I'm sure some people are still

26:02.280 --> 26:09.960
disappointed because the internet is crazy sometimes. But I think it was a nice, pretty

26:09.960 --> 26:16.320
meaty show, considering that it wasn't a major direct. You know, it wasn't, you know, one of the

26:16.320 --> 26:22.880
Nintendo's, they called it a mini, basically. It was pretty maxi for a mini. So.

26:24.640 --> 26:31.720
I still think Sonic for Tears looks so boring. I don't know what it is about that. Like, it just

26:31.720 --> 26:37.800
does not show well. I think I need to see, like, streamers playing that game or just, I think I

26:37.800 --> 26:42.120
need to see what the game, like, really truly looks like in motion from real people in order

26:42.120 --> 26:48.120
to be able to make, like, an accurate judgment on it or get my hands on it or get hands on it

26:48.120 --> 26:56.440
myself, obviously. But yeah, I just. I'm not really enthused so far by what I'm seeing,

26:57.080 --> 27:00.280
considering all the hype behind the whole open world thing, but we'll see.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.680
Yeah. Go ahead. Just a second.

27:04.680 --> 27:10.280
Oh, I was just saying, I just popped on Nintendo's channel on the site, and they're

27:10.280 --> 27:16.120
apparently having a sale through the seventh. Yeah, there's a lot of places having a long,

27:16.120 --> 27:19.960
you know, because it's a holiday, even though there's nothing worth celebrating this year.

27:19.960 --> 27:24.520
Technically, it's a holiday, so there's a lot of sales going on right now. So yeah, Nintendo's one

27:24.520 --> 27:28.920
of them. Steam's wrapping up their, if they didn't already, their summer sale's coming to an end

27:28.920 --> 27:35.320
pretty soon. I know Battle.net's been having one, like, I'm sure Epic Games. Well, they did

27:35.320 --> 27:38.840
one earlier, so I'm not sure they're running one right now, but there's a lot of sites having a

27:38.840 --> 27:44.520
sale. So yeah, Nintendo's even on that too. And the rare first party games even on sale with that.

27:44.520 --> 27:48.680
So there's a lot of stuff you can catch up on because Nintendo games, like, never go on sale,

27:48.680 --> 27:52.600
even if they're like five years old. It's very interesting. Yeah. So.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.400
But I mean, I'll put it this way. They're barely on sale.

27:55.400 --> 27:59.560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a $50 game is down to like $35.

28:01.160 --> 28:03.560
Yeah. They're calling it the super sale.

28:03.560 --> 28:07.080
Yeah. It's not, yeah. It's not going to be like Steam where it's like,

28:07.080 --> 28:11.240
I picked up a game for $2 that's normally like $45. So yeah.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.440
But it's through Tuesday.

28:14.360 --> 28:20.680
SSJ100Matt says Prime Day is apparently July 12th through 13th, so everyone is running sales soon to

28:20.680 --> 28:26.200
try to get in front of that. That makes sense. Elliot B. in chat says I got inside on Switch

28:26.200 --> 28:31.400
for $2. Well worth it. And that is a good reminder is that there's not just the Nintendo first party

28:31.400 --> 28:36.280
games, but there's a whole lot of indies on the Switch store that oftentimes have a hard time

28:36.280 --> 28:42.360
getting spotlighted on that store. So the sales really call attention to certain things there. So

28:42.360 --> 28:45.720
I'm good call on that. The game I wanted to play is actually

28:45.720 --> 28:48.680
down to 30 bucks and that was Persona 5 Strikers.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.680
Oh, yeah. It's worth checking out.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.800
Yeah. So I think I'm adding it to my list.

28:54.360 --> 28:59.000
Good call. All right. Well, since we're talking about games we're going to be playing,

28:59.000 --> 29:02.760
let's talk about games we have been playing in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week?

29:02.760 --> 29:05.000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

29:06.600 --> 29:12.440
Of course I've been playing Dead by Daylight. I actually have started, well, I mean,

29:12.440 --> 29:17.880
I mentioned this already, but I've been playing Survivor and I haven't hated it.

29:19.240 --> 29:25.080
And indeed it's actually been a lot more fun than I thought it would be because I've had friends

29:25.080 --> 29:34.600
playing with me. I've been playing mostly with Finara, who we've seen in our chat many, many

29:34.600 --> 29:43.640
times, who was also my roommate in college and one of my best friends, like family level best

29:44.600 --> 29:51.640
friend. And then I've played with you some, Rob, and that was fun. And just the other day I played

29:51.640 --> 29:57.400
with Craigle, another streamer friend. And I'm going to be joining on the post-show

29:57.400 --> 30:00.920
tonight for a little bit after dinner. So I won't be there right away, but after dinner

30:00.920 --> 30:03.720
and production of OLR is done, I'll hop in for a little bit.

30:03.720 --> 30:09.640
Well, and I'm sure that given that Finara is three hours ahead of us, she'll want to take a break.

30:09.640 --> 30:22.440
So it'll be good. But also I finished Terranigma and what a poopy ending.

30:24.680 --> 30:32.680
What a poopy ending. I had gotten so into the game and I was so excited about where I thought

30:32.680 --> 30:40.440
the ending was going. And then it's like, no. We were comparing it to The Mist, that movie.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.240
Did you see that in the theater?

30:43.240 --> 30:47.880
I did not see it in the theater, but I'm very aware of how they changed the ending from the book.

30:47.880 --> 30:52.200
And even Stephen King was like, this is fucked up what you did. I like it.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.320
Well, yeah, but I hated it.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.800
No, I know a lot of people did. A lot of people did.

30:58.280 --> 31:07.080
Because the movie was awesome. It was so good. And then that's what Terranigma is to me.

31:09.160 --> 31:13.800
If you have no idea, by the way, with The Mist, please don't spoil it for yourself.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.960
Just watch the movie and send us an email. Participate at orangesontrader.com.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.080
And I want you to cuss us out.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.680
Then read the book and be mad about it.

31:21.320 --> 31:25.640
I want you to cuss us out about how that movie ends.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.920
And then be mad about it after you read the book. Just saying.

31:31.400 --> 31:40.760
So anyway, when I finished that, I could not get my translated copy of Final Fantasy 6 to work.

31:41.400 --> 31:49.480
So I started the American Final Fantasy 3 and I got a bit of the way through it, right at the

31:50.280 --> 31:56.920
start. But I did finally get it patched with a translation.

31:56.920 --> 32:00.840
Because I own a Japanese copy of it and I own an American copy of it.

32:01.480 --> 32:06.840
So I am well within my rights to play a digital recreation of it.

32:08.440 --> 32:11.400
I can legally do so because I own both copies.

32:12.360 --> 32:20.440
So I will be starting over on that one this Wednesday for Retro Night.

32:22.360 --> 32:25.400
And I'm looking forward to seeing what the differences are.

32:26.920 --> 32:34.520
It's been so long since I've played the game that there's so many things that I'm remembering and

32:34.520 --> 32:40.200
so many things that are kind of new to me again. Just because I didn't remember certain things

32:40.200 --> 32:45.400
happening. I mean, this was the game that I basically skipped a week of school for,

32:45.400 --> 32:54.920
pretending I had the flu. And I've also found some other ROM hacks that do new stories for

32:54.920 --> 33:01.240
Final Fantasy 6. And I'm sort of thinking about doing them, but I'm also thinking about doing

33:01.240 --> 33:06.120
Star Ocean after that, because people have requested it. Either that or Emerald Dragon.

33:06.760 --> 33:16.120
And then I have to think if I want to play the SNES copy or the Turbo Duo version, or I should

33:16.120 --> 33:23.400
say PC Engine Duo. Because I do have the original PC Engine version of the game.

33:25.960 --> 33:31.560
So I've got some decisions to make, but I've got time because Final Fantasy 6 is something

33:32.360 --> 33:40.040
I can take my sweet time with and explore and see if I can remember all the fun little secrets in

33:40.040 --> 33:48.920
it. And of course, I've also been playing wordscapes. And I think I am fairly close

33:48.920 --> 33:58.680
to being at, oh gosh, I just hit my lap. Fairly close to being at level 10,000.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.640
Wow. Not too far. I love that game. I mean,

34:03.640 --> 34:12.360
it's like my perfect kind of stress relief game. And I did just buy Persona 5, so I'm just saying.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.960
We'll be hearing about that next week. Maybe if I can get my

34:19.000 --> 34:24.680
butt over to actually play something. Oh, and I need to get the Delicious Last Course for Cuphead.

34:24.680 --> 34:28.680
So I'm going to do that too. All right. Well, while Dark Soccer

34:28.680 --> 34:32.440
fills up her shopping cart, let's go over to Loki and talk about his gaming week.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.480
With all Minecraft again. I was very busy this week. I made two videos this week.

34:37.480 --> 34:40.520
Yeah, I was going to say you were teasing a big premiere last night, right?

34:41.320 --> 34:48.760
Yeah, it was last night that I put out a video. So earlier this week, I finished up my

34:48.760 --> 34:55.800
hardcore series. So that was fun. Very chaotic. And then, of course, put out a new episode of

34:55.800 --> 35:01.480
Nerd Craft, or not Nerd Craft Channel 64. I'm getting all my S&Ps mixed up. So another episode

35:01.480 --> 35:08.120
Channel 64, which I built a giant met for Mega Man. That's my starter base. So it looks awesome.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.560
Definitely worth checking out. At least, you know, check out the thumbnail.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.040
Yeah, that's pretty much it. I was going to say you can kind of see it,

35:16.040 --> 35:23.240
even the thumbnail, like the how gigantic this base is in your latest video. I'm trying to see

35:23.240 --> 35:27.880
if I can actually see it in the video somewhere. Like, I think I found it. I think I found it.

35:27.880 --> 35:31.640
So Oh, this looks really cool. Actually, hold on, I'm going to show it for those that are watching

35:32.360 --> 35:39.400
live on the voice geeks network over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And that's from Loki's latest

35:39.400 --> 35:44.760
video, this gigantic base. For those in the podcast feed, it looks like one of those Mega

35:44.760 --> 35:49.880
Man two enemies with like the construction hats that spit bullets at you like faithfully recreated

35:49.880 --> 35:56.040
in blocks on top of this really just giant base that Loki's working with. And, you know, I know

35:56.040 --> 36:02.520
Loki's starter base. Yeah, you talk a lot about Minecraft on this show. But for those that haven't

36:02.520 --> 36:07.560
really checked out your YouTube or your it's because you're you're you're really doing a lot

36:07.560 --> 36:12.920
with this game. And I mean that I mean that in the nice way, not like in the Wow, he does a lot. No,

36:12.920 --> 36:16.280
I mean that in like, you're really invested in this game and in this community.

36:17.000 --> 36:23.080
Yeah, definitely. So check that out over at YouTube. Loki underscore o lr. Awesome.

36:24.040 --> 36:30.920
All right. I watched some of the older videos not too long ago. It was quite entertaining.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.120
Yeah. Believe it or not, look, he'd have some good stuff.

36:36.600 --> 36:41.800
Yeah, at least I tried to. Yeah. No, it's good. I'm really happy that

36:41.800 --> 36:48.360
things are picking up and up for you, too. So. All right. My gaming week, I had a weird gaming

36:48.360 --> 36:51.880
week. I'm going to be the first one to admit. So I've been playing the usual stuff, of course.

36:51.880 --> 36:57.880
Final Fantasy 14. I was out doing Pokemon Go today. Nobody told me that collection challenge

36:57.880 --> 37:02.440
resulted in a regional. So I'm glad I did it and did some Bluetooth catching today,

37:02.440 --> 37:06.840
because then when Panseer showed up, I was like, Wait, what like that? That was the giveaway for

37:06.840 --> 37:10.600
this. Hold on. Is that is that the name of that guy? I don't know. Somebody in shadow,

37:10.600 --> 37:15.240
correct me if I'm wrong. But yes, that was nice. And then playing, you know, a little bit of

37:15.240 --> 37:19.080
Ingress. I hit level 16 again for the third time. I don't know if I ever said that on the show,

37:19.080 --> 37:23.400
but I hit 16 for the third time in Ingress. And now I'm kind of slowing down on that. Like I only

37:23.400 --> 37:29.000
I only go out and raise havoc if I need to. And then also playing a little bit of Pikmin.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.480
Okay. But here's where my week gets weird. So y'all know I have a new computer. So I've been,

37:33.480 --> 37:38.360
you know, installing games on it, checking out what's on Game Pass, seeing how games look. And

37:38.360 --> 37:43.320
then I was like, I'm gonna go I'm gonna go back in the vault and play some old games. And I really

37:43.320 --> 37:49.560
can't explain this, especially when I well know I have a backlog of new games to play. Like I've

37:49.560 --> 37:54.120
been meaning to play tunic for like two months now. Everybody's yelling at me to go back and

37:54.120 --> 37:58.920
finish like a dragon, especially after this last week in summer games done quick, and all this

37:58.920 --> 38:04.200
other stuff. But you know what my brain did? My brain's like, you know what game I want to see

38:04.200 --> 38:11.400
on my 4K monitor, really smooth like butter and playing on the PC. I'm gonna go play Elder Scrolls

38:11.400 --> 38:19.000
for Oblivion. And that's what I played. And I don't mean like, oh, I fired it up and just like

38:19.000 --> 38:23.080
checked out the start screen and then quit. No, no, no. I went through the whole introduction

38:23.080 --> 38:29.160
dungeon. I got out into the world. I went around the town selling stuff. I went to the Umbra

38:29.160 --> 38:34.200
dungeon to get the Umbra sword. Like I played a significant chunk of Elder Scrolls for Oblivion.

38:34.200 --> 38:41.960
And I it's I most of my playtime on that game was on the 360 or the one or whatever. So I hadn't

38:41.960 --> 38:47.000
done a lot of like mouse and keyboard play with that game. So that was kind of neat to go back

38:47.000 --> 38:51.400
and play that. And it yeah, it looks really pretty. I'm not gonna lie. It's like that's the

38:51.400 --> 38:56.600
best this game is ever gonna look. It still looks dated, of course, because that game is like 15.

38:56.600 --> 39:01.000
Well, I'm sure you could throw a bunch of mods at it, too. And that is that's what Alan was

39:01.000 --> 39:05.640
saying is throw mods at it. And then I'm like, well, hold on, because eventually this is gonna

39:05.640 --> 39:14.360
happen with Skyrim. So we'll get there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then the other game, I randomly went

39:14.360 --> 39:19.960
back in the archives and started playing. So I was playing Diablo, Diablo Immortal for a hot minute.

39:19.960 --> 39:24.600
Didn't spend any money on it. I didn't like that. That was a yes. Yes, I've heard all the stories

39:24.600 --> 39:30.600
about it. I checked it out. But then I was like, you know, the only thing with Diablo Immortal is

39:30.600 --> 39:36.680
that because they didn't design it for the PC, they designed it for a mobile phone. When you

39:36.680 --> 39:41.640
play it on PC, it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't look good because it's running through an Android

39:41.640 --> 39:46.920
emulator, I'm pretty sure. So it just looks a little like like the graphics could look better.

39:46.920 --> 39:50.920
And I was like, you know what, I want to go back and see what Diablo three looks like.

39:51.640 --> 39:57.160
And boy, boy, did I fall down a rabbit hole playing Diablo three season. What the fuck season

39:57.160 --> 40:05.400
are we on 26 of Diablo three, and I'm leveling a crusader. Yeah, I've spent hours playing that. So

40:05.400 --> 40:11.720
it's funny. Tiger Claw in chat says it's normal for a person to build a high end PC to play old

40:11.720 --> 40:16.760
games from years ago, because those old games are going to run buttery smooth on like the old PC.

40:16.760 --> 40:20.360
It's like an old game you used to play that ran like crap on an old PC,

40:20.360 --> 40:26.440
and then you revisit it and see that it runs better. Yes, yes, that is it. Because I have

40:26.440 --> 40:31.480
dropped a lot of hours on Diablo three in the past. So going back to revisit it now where it's

40:31.480 --> 40:37.960
like, I can play in 4k, like 60 plus frames a second. I don't know if it's capped or what,

40:37.960 --> 40:44.280
but just it it's like, the game isn't ever going to look better than this. And I'm like,

40:44.280 --> 40:49.080
this is nice, especially because that game is also I think hitting its 10 year anniversary,

40:49.080 --> 40:52.440
even though we don't count the first two years, that game is still hitting its anniversary.

40:52.440 --> 40:57.000
And it's like, that's a pretty old game too. But sorry, not sorry. Like it's just,

40:57.000 --> 41:02.280
it's fun to go back and revisit an old friend and be like, you got some work done. You've

41:02.280 --> 41:06.840
got your fillers and your face left. You're looking wonderful. And your wigs, you're looking

41:06.840 --> 41:14.280
wonderful. So, so that was my gaming week, Diablo three with wigs. It was great.

41:16.760 --> 41:22.600
All right. Yeah, TigerClawnChat. What's that? Girl who did that nose.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.920
TigerClawnChat says it's one of the joys of having a faster computer. Absolutely.

41:29.560 --> 41:34.520
Questbuster in chat says, lol, I've seen a lot of people say, man, I hate what they've done with

41:34.520 --> 41:40.520
Diablo immortal, but now I can get into Diablo three instead. It's very that like playing Diablo

41:40.520 --> 41:46.360
immortal made me realize I'm really excited for Diablo four and I should just go play Diablo three.

41:47.480 --> 41:54.040
So for better or for worse, I guess Blizzard got that on me. So there you go. All right,

41:54.040 --> 41:58.760
let's get into some other gaming news going on throughout the industry. We'll start with

41:58.760 --> 42:05.560
Loki on another Microsoft owned. I mean, I guess Blizzard is soon to be Microsoft owned,

42:05.560 --> 42:07.720
but let's talk about one they already own. Right, Loki?

42:08.280 --> 42:14.040
Yeah. So apparently there is a report that was put out by Kotaku earlier this month

42:15.240 --> 42:22.200
that was talking about crunch. I mean, everybody's been talking about crunch at different studios,

42:22.760 --> 42:29.880
claiming that ZeniMax was crunching that will basically having their employees crunched during

42:29.880 --> 42:35.400
the development of Fallout 76 and Skyrim and talking about like, you know, that,

42:36.920 --> 42:41.560
you know, this is not a really healthy environment for their employees. So of course,

42:43.080 --> 42:51.320
the ZeniMax or Matt Booty, the head of Xbox games studio said that report was unfair to

42:51.400 --> 42:56.040
tribute. Well, first off, it's playing the blame game. So he's saying it's unfair because

42:56.680 --> 43:01.880
you're tripping the crunch culture only to Bethesda, which I don't think is true. I mean,

43:01.880 --> 43:08.680
if you just had eyes, he would know that there's been dozens of articles that have come out about

43:08.680 --> 43:13.640
different companies crunching for different games. Yes. So it's not exclusively Bethesda

43:13.640 --> 43:20.600
and also saying, well, it's not fair because they're looking back too far. Right. That was

43:20.600 --> 43:28.440
back in 2018 and during Skyrim's development and stuff. But he didn't comment about what's going

43:28.440 --> 43:38.120
on now. I'll give him this crumb. It was before Microsoft owned them. So I can see why he is

43:38.120 --> 43:43.080
saying it's unfair to ask him or, you know, put it on Microsoft, you know, all this stuff that

43:43.080 --> 43:48.600
happened before they were in the picture. And to piggyback on this comment, Phoenix7726 in chat

43:48.600 --> 43:53.000
says, I wish Activision was not keeping Kotick on, but, you know, abuse is okay and all. So

43:53.000 --> 43:57.320
fuck Activision. I don't disagree with you. And I still have a lot of problems with what's going on

43:57.320 --> 44:02.600
to Activision, but I also kind of feel like with the Microsoft purchase, you sort of see the light

44:02.600 --> 44:09.880
at the end of the tunnel. Not that Microsoft is a company free of problems. However, you do see

44:09.880 --> 44:17.080
things like they are acknowledging unions. They are working, you know, with these concerns and

44:17.080 --> 44:21.800
things to try to be at the cutting edge of that. The way Microsoft has been one of the first to

44:21.800 --> 44:26.920
step up and make their games more accessible and work with accessibility controllers and things of

44:26.920 --> 44:32.040
that sort. The way that, you know, Microsoft has also kind of really tried to eliminate crunch

44:32.040 --> 44:37.080
time where they can and so forth. Again, I'm not trying to like say, oh, Microsoft is untouchable

44:37.080 --> 44:43.160
and they're a company free of wrongdoing. They're not, but I feel like at least Phil Spencer

44:43.160 --> 44:51.320
specifically and a lot of the Xbox team as a result is the culture that is trying to listen

44:51.320 --> 44:58.040
and do better. And that is important. And I, of course, I want to see Bobby Kotick gone.

44:59.160 --> 45:03.880
I'm still trying to hold a shred of hope that that might happen. And that there's a lot of facade

45:03.880 --> 45:10.920
that has to happen until this deal is finalized. Once this deal is finalized, if Kotick is still

45:10.920 --> 45:16.280
there, you'll probably hear me bitching a lot more until he's gone. I'm trying to hold out a

45:16.280 --> 45:22.600
shred of hope that there's just kind of a hush, hush, shh, let him think what he wants, you know,

45:22.600 --> 45:28.680
until Microsoft actually, the deal is signed and everything's done. But I'm really trying to hope

45:28.680 --> 45:33.160
and hold out faith that Bobby Kotick's days are numbered as is that board because they're rendered

45:33.160 --> 45:37.880
irrelevant once Microsoft owns them. So anyway, sorry, not to deviate too much. I know this is

45:37.960 --> 45:42.440
a Bethesda story, but I kind of wanted to say like what my current thoughts are on all that.

45:42.440 --> 45:48.120
And certainly, yeah, certainly I would say, you know, it might be good for them to like reassure

45:48.120 --> 45:51.800
like, hey, listen, you know, that may have been what their culture was in the past, but here

45:51.800 --> 45:56.360
Microsoft are going to try to make sure that that doesn't happen. That was a better answer. Yeah.

45:56.360 --> 46:01.400
He just mentions that they have anonymous ways to report that to HR or something like that.

46:01.400 --> 46:06.440
But, you know, typically even, you know, we've heard stories like even so much as Activision,

46:06.440 --> 46:10.920
you know, that reporting the HR doesn't do anything. HR protects corporations,

46:10.920 --> 46:16.600
they don't protect people. So it's, I don't know if that's necessarily like a really good

46:16.600 --> 46:23.480
approach. It's not really reassuring. But like, yeah, they haven't chose to publicly comment on

46:23.480 --> 46:31.000
what the work conditions are. So, you know, we better not find out in two years time that,

46:31.000 --> 46:35.720
oh, hey, they were crunching whoop. Yeah, that would be ugly.

46:35.720 --> 46:39.240
Because that'll look pretty bad. But you know why I don't think they are? Because they delayed

46:39.240 --> 46:45.000
Starfield. And I think that's probably a sign that things have changed because I don't think

46:45.000 --> 46:52.440
old Bethesda would have delayed Starfield. So I think I think that is, I think that's a good sign.

46:52.440 --> 46:57.320
Again, I would be mad to if I heard this, but I think that's a good sign. That's, it's turning

46:57.320 --> 47:04.840
out for the better. So, all right. Well, moving on, let's talk about kind of a surprise, not

47:04.840 --> 47:12.280
surprise announcement of a game release on a new console. And that is Phantasy Star Online 2 New

47:12.280 --> 47:17.640
Genesis. It's finally coming out for PlayStation 4. I thought that this was pretty much exclusive

47:17.640 --> 47:23.800
to Microsoft and PC forever, but I guess it must have been a limited timeframe. So PlayStation 4

47:23.800 --> 47:28.520
will get its release of Phantasy Star Online, or excuse me, Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis

47:28.520 --> 47:35.880
on August 31st, 2022. The Japanese version of course was released on PS4 a long time ago.

47:35.880 --> 47:41.240
It's also on the Nintendo Switch and nothing has been said about the Nintendo Switch version here.

47:41.240 --> 47:46.760
Keep in mind the Switch version is a cloud run thing. So that could also be just some of the

47:46.760 --> 47:52.920
challenges there is who would host that and pay for it to have that game come out here. But the

47:52.920 --> 47:57.240
fact that it's coming out on PlayStation 4 over here is still a pretty big deal. It will be caught

47:57.240 --> 48:03.560
up with the Xbox version. The new Kavaris region will be there. The Waker class that was revealed

48:03.560 --> 48:09.640
recently, that will all be there and cross-play with Xbox and PC. So it's kind of nice to see

48:09.640 --> 48:15.400
that as well. So of course the game will be free to play as well. So yeah, a lot of people excited

48:15.400 --> 48:21.160
about that. I guess that news also coming out of Anime Expo because there's an art exhibition going

48:21.160 --> 48:28.520
on there where there's like concept art and things like that. So cool that Phantasy Star Online 2

48:28.520 --> 48:34.120
is going to be exposed to a new audience. You know, I loved the original and I tried to get

48:34.120 --> 48:37.320
into the sequel and I tried to get into New Genesis a little bit too. And maybe it's one of

48:37.320 --> 48:45.720
those games I need to revisit at some point. But I was almost, they sat on it so long before

48:45.720 --> 48:52.040
releasing it here in the US that my issue ended up being I was so overwhelmed when I started

48:52.040 --> 48:57.640
Phantasy Star Online 2, I didn't know where to begin. And like, I wasn't sure if I was playing

48:57.640 --> 49:05.720
the game right. Because it was just so much to do that I was like, is this the right thing to be

49:05.720 --> 49:13.080
doing? I know it's a weird approach, but like it's, you know that gif of Sabrina the teenage

49:13.080 --> 49:18.200
witch where like all these plates of pancakes are suddenly coming into frame. And she's like,

49:18.200 --> 49:22.760
huh? Like she has nowhere to begin. That's like me playing Phantasy Star Online 2. That's how I

49:22.760 --> 49:30.680
felt. So it's too many pancakes. So, but I, you know, now that I have a PC that runs better,

49:30.680 --> 49:34.120
that really is one of those games I should go back and revisit and see if I can kind of get

49:34.120 --> 49:38.360
into it the second time around. We'll see. All right, moving on, Dar Sakura.

49:38.360 --> 49:46.440
So, you know, the internet can be a very toxic place. We all know this. I mean,

49:46.440 --> 49:52.680
were we not just talking about like, you know, last week about some of the negativity that

49:52.680 --> 49:54.680
we've seen in our early days? Sure.

49:55.960 --> 50:05.160
Well, the Return to Monkey Island director Ron Gilbert has decided to no longer talk about the

50:05.160 --> 50:13.160
game online due to abuse, particularly about the art style. Video Games Chronicle actually did

50:13.160 --> 50:20.520
make a report on it that he said on his personal blog that has now actually been completely shut

50:20.520 --> 50:30.200
down. I will quote, the joy of sharing has been driven from me. And it's just, it's very sad to

50:30.200 --> 50:34.200
see this. And in fact, I'll go ahead and read the rest of the quote. I'm shutting down comments.

50:34.200 --> 50:38.920
People are being mean and I'm having to delete personal attack comments. It's an amazing game

50:38.920 --> 50:43.000
and everyone on the team is very proud of it. Play it or don't play it, but don't ruin it for

50:43.000 --> 50:47.880
everyone else. I won't be posting any more about the game. The joy of sharing has been driven from

50:47.880 --> 50:59.080
me. And yeah, like there are other people who have come to his defense and the team's defense,

50:59.640 --> 51:06.360
basically shaming all of the people who came out and said such horrible, terrible things.

51:08.200 --> 51:15.800
He's also on record, I'll give another quote. Return to Monkey Island may not be the art style

51:15.800 --> 51:21.880
you wanted or were expecting, but it's the art style I wanted. He said the point of the games

51:21.880 --> 51:27.720
was always to use state of the art text and art to push the franchise forward.

51:28.600 --> 51:35.640
And even if he had been the one to make Monkey Island 3, he wouldn't have made it look like the

51:35.640 --> 51:44.360
prior games either. But it is coming to PC and Switch later on this year, possibly other consoles.

51:46.920 --> 51:54.680
And it's on the game's website saying that this will be the exciting conclusion

51:55.240 --> 52:03.000
to the Monkey Island series. Now, to everyone who was a shit about it, fuck you.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.520
Those people aren't listening to this show.

52:05.720 --> 52:09.080
Rob, I know, but I can say whatever the fuck I want.

52:09.080 --> 52:13.640
Of course you can. But those people turn this show off in the first five minutes

52:13.640 --> 52:14.600
when we were talking about COVID.

52:14.600 --> 52:20.360
I don't care if they're listening or not. They're the garbage of the internet.

52:20.360 --> 52:21.880
I don't care what they think.

52:21.880 --> 52:22.380
Yeah.

52:23.180 --> 52:31.100
But that's just what I would say if they were listening, is fuck you.

52:32.460 --> 52:35.420
And I'm sorry no one ever hugged you when you were a child.

52:36.620 --> 52:40.700
You know, I'm sorry you had to live in an attic where no one ever loved you.

52:41.900 --> 52:44.860
But maybe it's about time to learn some compassion

52:45.500 --> 52:49.580
and learn that if you can't say something nice, don't fucking say it at all.

52:50.220 --> 52:52.700
And the art style looks fine to me.

52:56.300 --> 52:57.740
It's OK. I get it.

52:57.740 --> 53:05.260
Like, I get the like for me, it's like I love the original two Monkey Island games.

53:05.900 --> 53:11.580
I didn't necessarily like the Telltale Monkey Island games because the art style was different

53:11.580 --> 53:13.980
and the story was a little bit different as well.

53:13.980 --> 53:17.180
And I understand people are probably, you know, thinking when they heard,

53:17.180 --> 53:21.580
oh, a new Monkey Island game that it would be done similar to like Thimbleweed Park,

53:21.580 --> 53:27.820
where it's in a very similar style to the original like Maniac Mansion,

53:27.820 --> 53:29.100
Monkey Island type games.

53:29.100 --> 53:32.380
But yeah, that may be what you think it should be.

53:32.380 --> 53:34.700
But like when you're talking about the creator of the game

53:34.700 --> 53:36.540
and this is the art style that they want to go with,

53:36.540 --> 53:39.420
well, maybe just give it a chance or something, you know,

53:39.420 --> 53:42.540
and let the writing speak for it and stuff because, you know,

53:42.540 --> 53:47.340
I know that there is an article that it doesn't appear that we're talking about,

53:47.340 --> 53:54.860
where Miyamoto did not like the appearance of cel shaded link of, you know, to link, if you will.

53:54.860 --> 53:58.140
That's because they're bringing up Wind Waker in our chat room right now.

53:58.140 --> 54:04.460
And talking about how these these kids today don't remember that there was controversy with that.

54:04.460 --> 54:05.900
Well, and that's the thing with Wind Waker.

54:05.900 --> 54:11.740
Like, it's funny, like after playing Wind Waker, it's like, I really like that art style.

54:11.740 --> 54:14.620
Like I thought when I first saw it, I'm like, Oh God, that looks terrible.

54:14.620 --> 54:17.420
But then you actually play the game and the world and everything.

54:17.420 --> 54:19.980
And that art style really fits with that.

54:19.980 --> 54:25.340
And so it's just, I don't know, I think people just need to give it up.

54:28.540 --> 54:32.300
People are quick to react and and slow to accept.

54:33.100 --> 54:39.660
And there is like this weird sort of duality to the internet where they have both

54:39.660 --> 54:42.220
very short memories and very long memories.

54:42.780 --> 54:46.380
And they're in their selective memories, you know.

54:46.380 --> 54:48.300
They don't have long memories. They have a search bar.

54:49.900 --> 54:53.980
No, some people do. Oh, I remember something that happened on the internet here.

54:53.980 --> 54:59.260
Let me go look through the Wayback Machine and see if I can find it and find the receipts on it.

54:59.900 --> 55:07.180
You know, but at any rate, I think that people just need to shut up.

55:07.180 --> 55:13.820
I mean, there are things that do deserve to be called out, as we will be discussing later.

55:14.940 --> 55:22.780
But when someone is so excited and are just doing nothing but positive things and talking about,

55:23.420 --> 55:28.060
you know, this this game that they're putting their heart and their passion into.

55:29.260 --> 55:34.460
When I mean, there's such a thing as being critical.

55:35.340 --> 55:37.820
You know, like a true constructive critique.

55:39.180 --> 55:41.420
And then there's such a thing as just being mean.

55:42.380 --> 55:45.580
And even the mildest of those were mean.

55:48.300 --> 55:54.460
So, you know, what what what they were doing were personal attacks.

55:55.660 --> 56:03.020
The an art direction that someone has integrated into their world view of this

56:03.020 --> 56:04.540
art that they're creating.

56:06.300 --> 56:10.860
Basically, you're attacking a fundamental piece of themselves,

56:10.860 --> 56:14.140
because everyone puts a little bit of themselves into their art that they make.

56:15.340 --> 56:19.660
Imagine, imagine screaming at Vincent van Gogh because you didn't like the way the painting turned out.

56:20.700 --> 56:23.660
Well, a lot of people did scream at Van Gogh, and then he killed himself.

56:25.100 --> 56:28.140
I guess that is true. Some some things never change.

56:28.620 --> 56:29.820
Some some things never change.

56:30.700 --> 56:34.220
I'm going to chat for some comments over twitch.tv slash vog network.

56:34.220 --> 56:37.820
S2100 Matt says a lot of the milder nasty comments were like,

56:37.820 --> 56:40.700
wow, this art style looks like garbage budget cuts much.

56:40.700 --> 56:42.860
You can't afford more than flash style art.

56:42.860 --> 56:45.580
Some folks were attacking them for deleting comments saying it's so

56:45.580 --> 56:47.660
important that you're deleting fans comments.

56:47.660 --> 56:49.260
Way not to listen to the community.

56:49.260 --> 56:52.300
If you can't listen to criticism, then how can you be in the game industry?

56:52.300 --> 56:53.980
Maybe hire a PR person.

56:53.980 --> 56:57.580
They're saying this to Rob Gilbert, who is a legend in the industry.

56:58.460 --> 57:01.420
And then S2100 Matt also makes the brings up the Wind Waker.

57:01.420 --> 57:03.100
Everyone can do what the fuck he wants with it.

57:03.100 --> 57:03.740
That's right.

57:03.740 --> 57:05.820
Rob Gilbert can do whatever the fuck he wants.

57:05.820 --> 57:06.940
Play his game or don't.

57:07.740 --> 57:11.260
But your comment on the Internet does nothing.

57:12.700 --> 57:16.460
I guess I hope if Ron Gilbert can take anything from this,

57:17.180 --> 57:20.620
I hope he knows that at the end of the day, those comments mean nothing.

57:21.180 --> 57:22.540
Those people mean nothing.

57:22.780 --> 57:29.580
But I at the same time, I really can't fault him for looking at his mentions

57:29.900 --> 57:31.500
and just seeing a cesspool.

57:31.500 --> 57:34.220
You know, of course, people are morbidly curious.

57:34.220 --> 57:37.820
How do you think sometimes we found the ugly comments about our show?

57:37.820 --> 57:39.260
Cause you're morbidly curious.

57:39.260 --> 57:42.780
You search for, Oh God, why, why did I look that up?

57:42.780 --> 57:43.660
I didn't need to see that.

57:45.100 --> 57:47.820
Is excited about something that they're creating.

57:47.820 --> 57:50.780
They do want to see what other people to show.

57:51.580 --> 57:53.660
What other people to share in with their excitement,

57:53.660 --> 57:55.100
and they'll probably check for it.

57:55.740 --> 57:59.820
And, you know, he made the mistake of reading the comment section.

58:00.940 --> 58:05.740
But again, you know, like when I put out my artwork,

58:05.740 --> 58:07.660
I want to see what people think about it.

58:07.660 --> 58:12.220
If I get like a good critique, you know, I've got a couple of friends

58:12.220 --> 58:15.980
who thankfully are also artists and can give me like true critiques

58:15.980 --> 58:19.260
and point out, you know, things here and there that I could have done better.

58:19.260 --> 58:21.660
And that's what I like, like to see just like,

58:21.660 --> 58:27.420
Oh, Hey, that shoulder is just a little bit bigger than what anatomy would say.

58:27.420 --> 58:28.460
And I'll be like, Oh, okay.

58:29.100 --> 58:34.940
You know, that's the kind of thing that I look for when, when I'm putting artwork.

58:35.660 --> 58:42.220
But I also think that there is a difference between being constructive

58:43.100 --> 58:45.980
and then being just destructive.

58:45.980 --> 58:52.220
And I would delete the destructive comments on my own personal stuff to to.

58:53.500 --> 58:59.260
I guess remove some of the sources of stress and and and maybe some triggering items.

59:00.060 --> 59:04.140
I have I see nothing wrong with what he did, and I understand

59:04.940 --> 59:07.500
why he's stepping away from sharing that.

59:08.060 --> 59:13.260
And I would like to say right now that if anyone listening to this episode live or

59:13.580 --> 59:21.900
in podcast form were among the people who said such mean, destructive things,

59:22.540 --> 59:27.820
I would like for you to take a step back and look really hard at what kind of person you are.

59:29.820 --> 59:35.900
Just stop and look and ask yourself, is this the kind of person you want to be seen as?

59:37.100 --> 59:42.300
And if you do want to be seen as a toxic piece of shit online,

59:42.460 --> 59:43.580
then I'd rather not know you.

59:43.580 --> 59:44.080
Yeah.

59:44.940 --> 59:48.700
And to be very clear, there is a very clear difference between constructive

59:48.700 --> 59:52.460
criticism because you just heard Loki say, I'm not the biggest fan of this,

59:52.460 --> 59:55.500
but I get you know, and now with it, but he says, but I at the end, it's his

59:55.500 --> 59:56.540
choice of what he wants to do.

59:56.540 --> 59:59.980
That is completely different from what Dark Soccer is talking about.

59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.220
Yeah, that's a simple statement of opinion.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:02.720
Yes.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:09.020
And some people would argue that saying that something looking like garbage is opinion as well.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:14.700
But at the same time, and I even talked about this before, intent versus impact.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:28.300
If you want to be constructive or say your opinion and still be tactful about it,

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:33.500
you can say something to the effect of, oh, it's not to my tastes.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.420
We'll see what happens when it comes out.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:35.920
There you go.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.840
We'll see what happens when it comes out.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.880
There you go.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.880
How many times do I say I'm going to reserve judgment for when the thing is out?

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.520
So, I mean, that's, or just don't say anything.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.720
Say it on your own freaking blog or whatever.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.080
Put it on your own Twitter.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.560
Yeah, I was just, you'll find you save a lot of time by just not saying anything at all.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:00:59.700
Yeah.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:07.360
But some people also want to get in a little bit on, I hate to say it this way,

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.480
but the witch hunt mentality where they're like, oh, I'm going to say something too

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.520
and be like all these other people, or I'm going to get in on the hate because of FOMO.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:25.200
Or I've got the best zinger and I want to get clicks by saying this really shitty thing

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.800
because it's the best zinger.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:34.400
And then the rest of us, we need to stop supporting it with our silence.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.560
And for the love of God, stop quote tweeting to dunk on it.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.440
And I've been guilty of this and I'm trying to do better.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.080
Stop quote tweeting to dunk on people.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:49.040
Screenshot it if you must, and then dunk on it because when you quote tweet it,

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.480
you're still giving them engagement.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:56.000
I mean, I will reply to things, but at this point I'm, you know,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.960
now I'm down to the line of blanket statements just because I can't.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.440
I don't want to support that kind of behavior.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:12.160
And I think that if more people are willing to stand up and call this bullshit out,

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.520
and I'm not saying just with this cruelty toxic environment on the internet,

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:28.480
but I'm also saying in real life, if you see somebody of, you know, a disenfranchised group

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:34.640
being attacked for something that they can't do really anything about,

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.800
you stand up and you fucking say something.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.960
You call people out.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.920
You never know who's going to stand with you.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:48.320
Just be willing to be a better person because silence is complicity.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.920
And that's what I'll say about it.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.960
A lot of people do things for like that, like the zingers I mentioned,

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.640
a lot of people do that for attention.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.160
And if you make it very clear, they're not getting attention, they're getting negativity,

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.400
you owe it to do that.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.560
Yeah, SJ100matt in chat says, there's also something to say for some people

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.120
that feel they can bully their way into harassing the creator,

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.120
forgetting what they want, how they want it.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.120
Yeah, I mean, mass effect.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.120
Yeah, again, you're not the artist.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.440
Anyway, knock it the fuck off.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.440
All right, let's move on to our next story.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:19.940
Loki.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:21.780
Yes.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.600
So we've talked a lot about different Niantic games that are coming out.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.040
But now we have the opposite.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.160
We have a lot of different games that are coming out.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.720
But now we have the opposite.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:44.480
So Niantic has actually cut projects, and they've also let go more than 80 staff.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.120
Apparently part of the projects that have been canceled,

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.880
the new Transformers game that they're supposed to be putting out.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.440
That's a bummer because they were testing that.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.440
Yeah, which I guess was codenamed Heavy Metal,

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.680
or I don't know if that was the official game for it.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.760
There's a canceled game called Hamlet,

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.320
which was, I guess, some collaboration between them and Punch Drunk.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.760
Blue Sky and Snowball.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.120
But I'm not sure if those are codenames or actual game titles.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.240
But yeah, they said they've recently decided to stop production on some projects

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:26.880
and reduce their workforce by 8% to focus on key priorities.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.760
There was the article that started getting copy pasted from the original Bloomberg

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:36.480
report was interesting because the Bloomberg report kind of lumped in Catan and it said

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.160
Catan and Pikmin Bloom were recent financial disappointments.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.120
Those games are very different because...

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.960
I didn't think, well, Catan never came out.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.960
Catan never came out outside Australia, New Zealand and the other test regions.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.360
So it did come out there for about a year.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.240
And like a lot of us were waiting on it, like, what's the hold up with Catan?

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.120
And then they canceled.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.320
So that's very different.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.400
Pikmin Bloom is out and running and they're doing community days.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.560
And as far as we know, the game is well enough to keep it running.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:12.800
So I sort of would like to know what is the source on Pikmin Bloom not meeting expectations,

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.400
because I'm not sure there is one.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.120
And that got copy pasted into, oh, it's failing.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.960
Now, again, I'm only going to defend Niantic so far.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.360
I do really love a lot of their products.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:29.760
But the recent changes they've made to Pikmin Bloom are terrible and reek of desperation.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.760
And that is that they halved the effectiveness of planting petals in the game.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.800
I'm not going to really get into the weeds for those that, you know, because it doesn't

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.840
make any sense if you haven't played the game, but just basically they're trying to coax

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.960
more people into spending money in the shop, which like, there really isn't a reason to

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.360
do it.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.440
And I feel like they're finally starting to see like, oh, this is going to be a really

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:55.120
they're finally starting to see like, oh, maybe we could do cosmetics and some other

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:55.680
things.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.040
And that might work out a little better.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.840
But I feel like they're kind of meeting that a little too late.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.640
And it's a lot of what a lot of people are saying about Pokemon Go as well.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.960
But anyway, my point really is, I still don't know if that necessarily means that Pikmin

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.480
Bloom is a failure.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:16.960
And I'd like to know where Bloomberg is getting that data.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.160
So that's just all.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.160
I don't know if it's because, oh, it's not making the Pokemon Go money.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.360
It's it's down in the top 100 grossing games.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.640
So here's where he's getting that from.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:37.600
He's giving it from and it was an email to staff reviewed by Bloomberg, where the Niantic

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:45.600
chief executive, John Hank, was saying that they are facing a time of economic turmoil

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.080
and they're reducing costs in a variety of areas.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:54.560
Yeah, but they that that report called out the Pikmin and Catan, not Hanky.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.800
So he wouldn't a CEO is not going to call out specific projects like that.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.240
That would be very demoralizing.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:07.120
Probably just taking guesses, I guess, based off of their popular, which I get it.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.040
It's not making Pokemon Go money.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.960
It's and in fact, I think the coin system and everything in that game has been busted

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.760
since the beginning.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I can see why Pikmin Bloom is probably not meeting expectation.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.800
It probably isn't, but I'm not sure they have the data to back that up.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.880
And nothing is going to make Pokemon Go money.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.380
Nothing.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.760
Except Pokemon Go.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:36.320
Now, again, remember everything I said at the top of the show, Pikmin was very incentivizing

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.840
for me to get to where I am now.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:43.200
So, yeah, I'm going to defend that game a little bit, but there again, it also has its

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.320
flaws, that's for sure.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.680
I did think it was also interesting.

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:53.200
All of this news came the day after that announcement that Niantic's making an NBA game.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.440
Well, I mean, it is a little.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.480
Well, when they first.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:06.800
Okay, keep in mind, I played Ingress first since 2014 and Pokemon Go came out, what,

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.000
2016?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.560
So actually, God, I was probably playing Ingress even before that.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:16.400
But anyway, when it was first announced that the makers of Ingress were going to make Pokemon

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.920
Go, my reaction was, that's fucking weird.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.120
And it turned out all right.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.480
So I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt.

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.520
And I understand that if they want to make Pokemon Go money, they've got to find the

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:33.440
franchise that has the fan base that's going to do that.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:37.200
And major sports is a pretty good place to start.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:41.440
And the biggest win for Niantic there, it's going to be a different audience, because

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.560
I would bet the people that are really into the NBA probably do not have a huge overlap

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.520
with Pokemon Go.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.000
Of course, there's some before you speak up in chat.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:50.640
I like both.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.000
Of course, there's some.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.920
But it is going to draw in a different crowd.

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.480
I'm just curious, what is the game?

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.640
You know what the crowd is?

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.960
It's the crowd of those people that play sports games that dump tons of money into those ultimate

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.520
team.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:10.320
And I don't know what the equivalent is in NBA 2K sports.

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.400
Sports fans will just dump money in that stuff.

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.680
It's a proven.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:14.400
You're not wrong.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.920
It's a proven thing with like EA is what makes that's their bread and butter and jam and

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.800
peanut butter.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.880
E3VL says, Do you have to jump in place and pretend shot unknown?

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.720
There's still a lot to kind of figure out because we've seen like three screenshots.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.560
It's kind of hard to tell what's going on, but you can guess it will involve going to

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.520
real world locations, including basketball courts.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:42.720
Now I know why they've been having us categorize in Niantic Wayfarer what a way stop is.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:46.800
They know exactly where all the sports courts are because they've been building that database

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.360
up for a few years and then doing something.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.520
But it looks like I don't think you're actually playing basketball.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.840
You're doing some type of team management sort of thing.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:10:01.280
They could just they could take the Pokemon, go Pokeball throwing is use that as a basketball

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.320
throwing into a hoop.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:06.800
Yeah, Quest Buster in chat says it feels like they're trying to Netflix their way to another

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.600
Pokemon go.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.240
Their Harry Potter game sounded like it could have printed money for him.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.360
Then it shut down.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.200
One thing I want to remind people about that Harry Potter game, because again, none of

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.880
the press seems to remember this.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:22.480
The Harry Potter game was a port key game who makes all those Harry Potter games.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.560
It's WB Warner Brothers games like little Harry Potter specific division.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:34.240
That was their game in partnership with Niantic, who I'm sure gave them an early version of

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.360
the light ship technology with all the, you know, where everything is in order to make

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.080
that.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.000
So that was a little bit different of a failing.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:51.520
And you and I and everybody else in this room know JK Rowling's unfortunate fucking mouth

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.680
had a lot to do with the failure of that game as well, because I'll tell you, that completely

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.800
killed my desire to play it.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.000
And I know I'm not the only one.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.200
So but that was a port key games failing in that.

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.400
Well, I shouldn't even necessarily say it was there.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.040
If it was anyone's failing, it was JK Rowling.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.000
She failed, but port key just didn't have the game that made money.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.080
And I think the reason why is because it wasn't Niantic.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.360
It was somebody else.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.600
They tried to make a game that was very similar to Pokemon go when it didn't really fit the

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.240
franchise.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.200
Where that game was best was when it did something different.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.360
When you did the gym battles and you were actually, like, battling with other people

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.600
and you were drawing the wand patterns to do different spells and you actually had,

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:45.440
like, the DPS tank healer trifecta and all that that you didn't see in Pokemon go, that

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.040
was where that game was its strongest was when it was trying not to be Pokemon go.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.880
So I think there were just a few decisions in that game.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:12:00.560
So Godatz in chat says, maybe I'm a bit of a dingus for thinking it, but wouldn't Niantic

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.360
do well to partner with similar games to Pokemon?

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.240
I wonder if titles like Digimon would get general interest.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.320
Well, some would argue more fun.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.160
Some would argue Pikmin is kind of that.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.360
It's Nintendo cute monster property.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.840
But I think at the end of the day, though, they don't want to split the player base.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.360
They don't really win by splitting their player base too much.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.800
That's why I think NBA I keep saying NBA Jam, which sadly, it's going to be nothing like

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:32.960
that.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.600
I wish it was.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:40.240
But the NBA game, that's why it's that because it's a very different fandom, I think.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.480
So it'll be interesting to see.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.880
And Mike Deff says Digimon already has its own AR game.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.720
Maybe it was already somebody else picked that up.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:54.960
So anyway, it'll be interesting to see because Niantic, don't forget, they still are scheduled

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.160
to release Pareto.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.560
As far as we know, that game was not canceled, but that game also hasn't been released.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.320
I should also say somewhere.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.120
This is very interesting.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.200
So Niantic Campfire sort of came out.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.280
Niantic Campfire has been built into Ingress for some time.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.560
This is their social network.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.200
And I got into Niantic Campfire for a few days.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.440
I can't get in now unless I get in through Ingress, which is weird.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.160
But if you are able to get into Niantic Campfire through the app, which apparently they have

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.080
figured out that people who have tickets to Seattle Go Fest are the ones that can get

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:28.240
in.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.680
They actually now have what fans have been asking for for a long time.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:39.840
And that is a map that you can scroll around on your phone and see all of the gyms and

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.400
what raid is going on in that gym right now.

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:46.080
You can't see what color it is or who's defending it, but you can see where all of

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.560
the raids are anywhere in the world, which I thought was interesting.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.400
So I'm very curious to see what the future of Campfire is, because many people are calling

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.680
it a knockoff of Discord, which, yes, all of the features we've seen so far are a knockoff

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.640
of Discord.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.760
However, that Pokemon Go map that came out of nowhere.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.600
That was something we hadn't seen yet.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.680
I'm curious what else we haven't seen.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.640
So we'll see.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.280
Anyway, let's move on.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:19.920
I'd like to talk about some updates for Twitch.television, the very platform we are

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.120
broadcasting on right now.

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.520
A couple of new things that have been teased.

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.960
The new channel switcher.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.080
I've seen this.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.000
So this is when you're browsing on Twitch.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.760
You now see like random channels on a carousel at the bottom of the screen, and you actually

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:39.360
get a one minute preview of the channel without having to watch an ad before going into the

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:45.760
channel, because many people will flip out or tune out because an ad comes on right away

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.600
when they load up the stream, even though the broadcaster may not be trying to have

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.160
that happen.

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:57.120
That's why when we're broadcasting live on Twitch, I do forced ads at the beginning

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:02.400
when the cats, the little, stay tuned, we're coming up soon, when the cats are on before

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.160
we go live, because that will buy us 30 minutes where that doesn't happen, and people can

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.480
just jump right into OLR without watching an ad.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.600
So the nice thing about the carousel is that you don't have to watch an ad to test a

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.160
channel.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.360
So that's pretty cool, because I do test a lot of channels, especially when drop campaigns

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.240
are going on.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:26.800
So like when drop campaigns are happening with No Man's Sky, I had to test a lot of

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:31.360
channels, and some streamers for No Man's Sky, pretty good.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.920
Some streamers for No Man's Sky, harder to watch.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.360
So the carousel switcher kind of gives me an opportunity to test the stream without

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.840
having to sit through a minute of ads before that.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.480
So that's nice.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:51.680
The other thing that's coming that's interesting is the guest star feature.

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:57.600
Guest star allows guests to join a host in a stream.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:02.480
Apparently it is similar to like Clubhouse or I think Mixer had this functionality before

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.360
it went away.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:07.280
Remember good old Beam, Mixer, and then went out to pasture?

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:14.320
You actually can include other streamers and viewers in the broadcast with video and audio,

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.840
so you kind of bring people in and out.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.960
So that's interesting that that feature, I haven't seen a lot of that feature in use

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:23.040
because only a very small audience has it right now, but I'm very curious to see what

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:31.200
that brings in because if we are able to get listeners, that is going to be a new way for

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.440
us to take calls on this show.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:37.200
And yes, I'm very open to that idea, so we'll see.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.840
Except the only problem is because of the fact that Dark Soccer and Loki and I are all

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:47.120
on Discord, but then the question is, can we do the whole show with Dark Soccer and

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.840
Loki being on their own streams and coming in here?

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.320
I don't know.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:56.800
This could change the formula, and I'm not saying we aren't going to do this or that.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.360
We're going to do what works for the show.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.200
But it's an exciting new idea, that's for sure.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.440
So I'm curious to see what comes of this feature.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.720
And I think, like Dark Soccer, I know right now this is only available on just chatting

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:17.360
streams, but how transformative is this going to be for the Dead by Daylight streaming

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:21.360
community if all of the streamers can now co-stream each other's games?

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:28.800
Yeah, instead of having to use the third-party multi-stream thing.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:37.600
Yeah, which is honestly a pain in the ass for someone to watch, especially if you get

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.360
easily overwhelmed by stuff.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.920
Yeah, which, you know, again, Mixer did it, which we could say, you know, a couple of

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.720
years ago, but it's nice to see Twitch, oh yeah, that was a thing that was kind of neat

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:57.120
about Mixer that will be very exciting when that launches here is if that comes to pass

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.960
and we can do like Dead by Daylight and stuff.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:03.520
Mike Defton chat says, Rob, you're probably the first person I've heard say something

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.280
dot TV as television.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.400
You're getting old.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.280
It's actually an in-joke from some streamers I watch.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:14.080
You know, it's just like the whole like when you want to sound old and clueless, you

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:19.120
talk about sound drops on my Twitch television.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:25.120
You know, this is what you, you know, it's just a way of speaking or it's like how

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.920
everybody calls Dead by Daylight something different.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:32.000
Deborah Delight or, you know, like, yeah, Debbie Delight,

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.200
Deadbeat Deadass or something, you know, like everybody just calls us something different.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.000
So, yeah, that always happens.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.160
Anyways, so I'll be curious to see what happens with that.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.520
Let's move on.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.240
Dark Sakura.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:53.200
So, EEA did a boo-boo.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:19:05.520
They, they, they, so they made a tweet, a very bad joke, especially given their history.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:14.720
They're basically, you know, taking, taking the piss on single player games.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:24.960
And so it posted, EEA posted at 733 the other day that they, they're a 10, but they only

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.880
like playing single player games.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:34.400
It was playing off a meme that was showing up on, on TikTok, like, that's already kind

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:34.880
of dead.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:46.560
And one of the Forbes writer, Paul Tassi, this was great.

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.800
This is a great clapback.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.680
Understandable.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.240
You are unfamiliar with the concept of 10s.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.440
He made Anthem.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.560
Just saying a fact here.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:00.480
Well, that actually, that last one came from a Washington Post from Gene Park on Washington

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:00.980
Post.

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.320
You know, that, that is, that's a read.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:05.920
That's a read.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:21.440
And then the, the head of, of Respawn, Vince Ambella, basically just replied with a facepalm

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:21.940
emoji.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.840
And then later there was, Roast well deserved.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:30.400
We'll take this L cause playing single player games actually makes them an 11.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.040
I mean, and keep in mind.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.560
Oh, that's so cringe.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:45.200
And keep, keep in mind that EA's best games, like their top selling games were the Sims

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:51.200
series and Dragon Age Inquisition, which guess what that was?

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:51.920
Single player.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:21:00.240
And when we had great multiplayer in Mass Effect, they took the servers down, which

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.000
was terrible.

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:12.240
But they're really trying to, to, I think, promote more with putting out, like putting

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:17.440
more of the effort into the multiplayer live service games like FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends,

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:20.160
and working on more monetization through them.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:26.560
But the other thing that they're doing is that they're making all these investments

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:34.160
into other companies and canceling them, like with Visceral Games, which they, what turned

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.440
into EA Redwood that did Dead Space.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:46.480
Yeah, they're, they're just shutting down studios that have put out good things because

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:47.680
they think it's too risky.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:58.880
And again, they're, you know, their multiplayer is being removed from upcoming games.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:07.520
You know, there was that Dragon Age Dread Wolf would have multiplayer, but I think they're

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.520
kind of going back and forth on that one.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:13.200
And speaking of which, thank God BioWare is still around and that they haven't been shut

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.440
down by EA like, you know, other companies.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:25.440
But they've also stepped in it when they said that some games would be online only, like

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.080
when they were going to make Sims 4 online only.

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:33.200
And then, I mean, they've...

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:37.840
Well, there was that whole SimCity was online only and boy, did they shit for that.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:48.640
Yeah, but the thing that, that while these other companies are, you know, really, you

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:56.320
know, taking it, you know, because of their own internal misconduct or overtime practices,

01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:06.800
you know, just abusing their employees, Blizzard is, not Blizzard, but EA is more like

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:14.960
we're going to put this game, you're going to buy it and then we're abandoning it.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:20.240
Or we think this company is going to be great under our hood, abandon, you know.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.460
Go ahead.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.760
I think they're just like a deadbeat dad.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:32.720
The tweet just reeked of how do you do fellow kids with just, you know, trying to play on

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.520
this meme and just not really thought out.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.400
And I want to point out something too, because a very clear difference between this and something

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:45.600
we were talking about earlier, we were talking about the other thing that was by Rob Gilbert,

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:51.200
a person, and, you know, who is, you know, trying to do a good thing and make some art here

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.880
and not okay to get dunked on.

01:23:53.920 --> 01:24:00.480
EA writing that tweet, a corporation trying to be the next Wendy's or God now Radio Shack

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:09.040
on Twitter, Radio Shack is now like the new bar for corporations trying to do a thing on Twitter.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.040
It makes me sad that my spouse no longer works for them.

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.880
Well, I think the whole thing is about crypto anyway, so I'm not sure.

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:19.120
Yeah.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.320
So I'm kind of like-

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:26.560
But I mean, it was, I bet if he said, oh yeah, I work at Radio Shack and it would be like,

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.800
oh, but does the cool tweet say something clever?

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.260
Yeah.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:37.680
Questbuster in chat, I love this comment, says funny coming from a company that got its start,

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.280
oops, it's just scrolling off the screen.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:43.760
Funny from a company that just got its start from games like Archon and Mule.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.800
Some of the best games ever made too.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.400
I don't think they've made a game that good since then, so oof.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:58.160
So anyway, yeah, EA just next time don't tweet that.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:04.000
Just, you need better PR people to do your social media.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.000
Or the thing is that tweet didn't even,

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:12.320
that tweet just kind of reeked of like written in a boardroom.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.880
That's what it is, I think the difference is.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.640
It's probably why it's so late coming out too.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:22.480
Radio Shack is somebody's alt account on their phone who gets high and decides to work.

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.680
That's cool.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.680
But like the EA one, I don't know.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.560
I'm reminded of that Saturday Night Live sketch and I don't think there's been a better sketch

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.360
recently with the whole, God, what was it?

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:42.080
It was Harry Styles was the guest and he was pretending to be a social media intern for,

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.160
what was the company?

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:49.360
Was it Hostess or Little Debbie or one of those like snack cakes companies or something like that?

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:55.520
And the tweets, they read to him what he wrote on the Instagram account and all this stuff.

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.000
It was just, anyway, I'm sorry, I'm not doing this justice.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:58.880
But it was really funny.

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.520
I think I've actually watched Saturday Night Live on purpose since the 90s.

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.080
No, this is the one worth watching is when he's, God damn it.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.920
What was somebody in chat, saved by ass here.

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.240
What was the social media brand he was pretending to be?

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.240
Was it Little Debbie or something like that?

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.200
Like the snack cakes?

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:16.400
I don't know.

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.720
But he was running their Instagram and he was writing all these nasty things like,

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.560
maybe I'll go out tonight and get railed.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.800
Skull, skull, skull, hey plant, hey plant.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.720
And he tweeted it like, what did you mean when you said this?

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:33.280
I remember that.

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.240
That was funny.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.280
Yeah, it was great.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.960
Thank you, Sarah Lee.

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.240
It was Sarah Lee.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:40.640
I honestly don't think that sounds funny.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:41.680
It was.

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.440
It wasn't just that.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:44.880
It's funny.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:45.600
All right.

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.960
Anyway, let's move on.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.920
We have more stories.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.360
I think we're to Loki.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:50.720
Yep.

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.560
Let's talk some more layouts again.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:27:01.840
So this time it is the game engine unity and they are deciding to they're going to be laying

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:02.640
off, I guess.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:09.280
I can't remember which percentage it was of it about slightly more than 200 people or

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.200
4% of its total workforce.

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.200
Basically, as part of a continued planning process where we regularly assess our resourcing

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:22.000
levels against our company's priorities, we decided to realign some of our resources to

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.120
better drive focus and support for our long term growth.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:34.480
So, yeah, not really sure what that refocus is, but yeah, it's more layoffs.

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.880
Joy, joy.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:41.360
All right.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.920
Well, we'll see.

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:44.320
We'll see.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.720
That's unfortunate.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:49.600
I would have thought that Unity's making a lot of money, too.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.440
So it's just kind of surprising to me, to be honest.

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.640
You know, I would think more people are game developing, especially in light of the pandemic

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.120
and everything.

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.840
It's just more people taking up Unity and stuff.

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:00.240
I don't know.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.360
Maybe they just maybe their plans made them a lot bigger than they ended up being.

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:05.840
I don't know.

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:06.320
It's weird.

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:11.280
That's just one of those where I'm like, I don't understand how did Unity not meet expectations?

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.880
I guess they set the bar too high.

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:14.080
That's a boardroom's fault.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:15.520
All right.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.920
Going on to our next story.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:24.160
I mentioned this earlier in the program because Bobby Black Wolf, who's on live before us,

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.160
was here and talking about this show from this last week.

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:36.080
But it's Summer Games Done Quick, and Summer Games Done Quick raised over, if you can believe

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:40.960
it, $3 million for Doctors Without Borders.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:46.160
And it was nice because it was the first year where it was back in person.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.600
And, you know, so Bobby was talking a little bit about that, that they were back in person.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:56.080
And they actually met $3 million and barely.

01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:02.480
They met it right at the end when a bonus of an Elden Ring was on the line.

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:06.000
And they damn near weren't able to do it because they didn't get the money.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:06.880
But then they did.

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.160
They raised that $3 million.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:13.600
And then you can just see the people that are in the room just cheering and so happy

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:17.520
and really excited that they had hit that $3 million goal there.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.360
And, you know, that's no small amount of money.

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:25.520
You know, for a lot of the crap that gamers get in this day and age, it's always nice

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:29.680
to have a story that talks about, here's a lot of the really, really good stuff that

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.960
gaming culture does.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:36.960
And, you know, Games Done Quick, whether it's Awesome or Summer, is just a great thing for

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.000
a lot of reasons.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.520
And obviously the money they're raising is one of them.

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.480
So again, I'll encourage you to go listen to Bobby's show if you want to hear more

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:48.000
about kind of the behind the scenes and all that stuff and what it was like at the event

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.120
back in person.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:55.440
But a job well done by everyone, all the speedrunners, all the donators, you know, everybody.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:02.560
I also understand that the person who has been running Games Done Quick for some time,

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.480
Sumichu, is actually departing.

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:09.360
Or I should say, obviously, it takes a village, it takes a team.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.560
It's not all one person.

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:15.680
But, you know, she's like the executive, basically the, you know, what is the official

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.080
title?

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:18.080
Sorry, there we go.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:23.120
Director of Marketing and Business Development, as well as other roles, said her goodbyes

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:23.680
and so forth.

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:29.600
So I hate to be the person that's going to step in and fill those shoes, because if you

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:33.840
look at everything that Games Done Quick has accomplished in the past eight years, she

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.760
set a very high bar.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:39.440
So job well done and retirement well earned for her.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.520
And nobody can fault her.

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:45.920
I'm sure it's a lot of pressure and a lot of time to do something like that.

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.480
So, you know, we all tip our hats.

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:51.440
Congrats on making that transition back to in person.

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.200
Hopefully the next one's in person, too.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.280
I mean, no one can say for sure at this point.

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:58.000
But yeah, job well done and all that good stuff.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.640
And, you know, again, $3 million for charity.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.160
That's awesome.

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.400
Gamers doing great things, for sure.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:05.760
All right.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.400
Definitely people start sticking the eye.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:08.880
What's that?

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:11.360
It's a definitely beats a sharp stick in the eye.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.080
Yes.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:15.040
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, we need more stories like this in this day and age.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:15.680
Yes, we do.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.320
We really do.

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:17.360
All right.

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:22.160
Let's get to our next segment and revisit some classic times, shall we?

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:38.160
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.480
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.120
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:49.440
But once a month, Dark Sakura picks a handheld electronic device.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.320
And so Dark Sakura, what is the classic handheld of the month?

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:57.280
Classic handheld of the month is Bandai Terror House.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:08.000
Um, it was actually in their second series of their handhelds.

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:16.000
So basically to go back into the history of these things is they were called the Bandai LCD

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:16.720
solar power.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:26.320
And the very first ones had one screen, little LCD screens, and the games that were out for

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:33.040
it were Invaders of the Mummy's Tomb or Nazo no Pyramid, Escape from the Devil's Doom,

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:43.840
Tengoku to Jigoku, Subattack or Gekisen U-Boat, Breakout, which is a daidaso, Shark Island,

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:52.880
Kyofu no Mujinto, and then Nazo no Chuu Botsu Sen that only came out in Japan.

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:55.840
So the second series is a double panel series.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:01.680
We could even say that this might have been an inspiration for the DS, maybe.

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:08.400
But the games that came out were Amazon or Hikio Amazon, Terror House, the one that I

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:16.640
brought up or Akurio no Yakata, Frankenstein or Mr. Franken, and Airport Panic, same name

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:17.120
in Japan.

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:23.360
So as for the people who are watching live, you can see that it's got like the little

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.800
LCD characters that just sort of pop on and move across, very game and watchy.

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:36.240
And this one was considered probably one of the favorites.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:47.600
So a little bit more about this, too, is that like for Terror House, the dual panel on it

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:54.560
is actually stacked piece by piece.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:34:01.920
And by the way, when I meant the DS, I meant like the 3DS, because it has that built-in

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:07.840
sort of 3D effect where it uses two panels.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:16.880
And it's not like the same sort of semi-lenticular one that the DS has, but it uses

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.400
sort of that same allusion to it.

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:29.280
So the series, the LCD Solar Power series, were first made by Bondi in 1982.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:34.960
The double panel series came out, of course, a little bit after that.

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:43.840
And they also had more variation in gameplay, and you could progress in two stages.

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:46.000
So it was pretty cool that way.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.120
And I mean, think about it.

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.280
These little games are easy to carry around.

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:59.760
They're sort of like I was talking about the game and watch as a relative of it.

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:06.960
But I mean, keep in mind, too, without this, would we have had our Tamagotchi or Digimon?

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.840
These certainly led up to it.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:10.900
Yeah.

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:17.920
Now, they had other games that were flip cases or had up to three LCDs.

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.800
But those came out later than that.

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:29.280
So this is really going to be kind of like the big one for their early electronic games.

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:35.360
Terror House, in particular, was...

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:41.760
I want to say that this was one of the more popular ones that came out.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:50.560
And of course, as far as variations of this particular game, they're saying that between

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:56.720
5,000 and 10,000 variations on this release were made.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.120
This is also one of the ones that came out in the United States.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.000
So there you go.

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:05.460
All right.

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:07.760
Your classic handheld of the month.

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:12.720
As Questpuster in chat says, Simon Belmont's long lost adventuring ancestor.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.640
Maybe in some ways.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.360
He predates.

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.800
I completely understand the comparisons you're making, though, to the 3DS.

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.520
It does look like an early, early version of that.

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.880
It looks like, oh, this is what a 3DS in 1982 would look like.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:30.880
It kind of does.

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.240
It's kind of neat to think that whether intentional or not,

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:36.560
it almost looks like an early version of that in some ways.

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:43.840
One thing I was thinking is that lenticular photography had existed.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.920
I want to say since the 50s or 60s.

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:52.000
What was that thing, the 3D wheel thing that was huge when we were kids?

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.360
You know, with the little photodisc in there?

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.320
View master.

01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:56.960
View master.

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:57.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.600
It's kind of similar to that, right?

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.160
Well, maybe not.

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.280
A little bit, yes.

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.760
What I'm thinking of is the souvenir thing that my mom had.

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:14.240
And it was almost like a quad pyramid-ish.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:17.120
It expanded out and it had a magnifying glass on one side.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:21.040
And on the inside, it had a little picture of, funny enough,

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:23.120
funny enough, of my mother in a bikini.

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:27.200
But it was a lenticular, well, sort of a lenticular image

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.760
where one was layered over the background,

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:33.200
sort of like her part was cut out to stand on top of it.

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.160
But with the 3DS, it was that full on,

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.880
like, you know how you couldn't look at the game from the side?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.360
Because it was using that same basis as those pictures

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:48.720
that you can turn to the side and make them move or animate.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.360
You know, it was something like that.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.760
But that technology existed for a while.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.800
You know, I would have thought that something like that

01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:01.840
would be able to be incorporated even as far back as the early 80s.

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:05.840
But this is still pretty, pretty smart.

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:06.240
Yeah.

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.480
You know, pretty smart use of the technology

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.760
that was available at the time.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.400
Now I'm thinking about the view master.

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.440
Like, those are so cool.

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:15.680
I wonder where I could find one of those in this day and age.

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.160
They rebooted them at some point, right?

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.280
They did.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.560
Now, there was another thing that I had that looked like an old video camera.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:24.880
Oh.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.200
And you put in these big cartridges.

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.240
They're by Fisher Price.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:28.740
Yep.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.880
And then you would play it.

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:34.320
And I had a Daffy Duck one, I think.

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:41.200
And then I had a Tweety one that was the one with Sylvester in the junkyard with the dog.

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:44.400
Well, it's literal film, right?

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.200
It is.

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:45.840
Yeah, it's like that.

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.960
Because the view master with those little wheels you put in there,

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.960
those were like pieces of film that would be in there.

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:54.160
That was like having a personal slide projector.

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:54.560
Yeah.

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.060
Yeah.

01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:00.720
But the little camera thing to me was the neatest.

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:03.520
Because then, you know, of course there's no audio to it.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:04.320
How could there be?

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.520
It's all mechanical.

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.960
But those things were so cool.

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:11.920
And I want to say I thought they tried to re-release those too.

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:18.480
Um, and I found mine again when I was an adult, but it had been crushed.

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:25.520
Here's how they did audio, at least on the view master, is you would have the record.

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:29.200
And then the record would say, click to the next frame when you hear the chime.

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.040
You know, and it would tell a story.

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.840
And you go to the next thing.

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:36.080
Okay, so let me ask you if you remember this.

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:41.200
Because it was, and I know I'm going a bit nostalgic on this one, but do you remember

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.760
was it Burger King or McDonald's that had the deal with gremlins?

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.800
Where you would buy the little picture book and it had the album in the back.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.200
And everyone was trying to get them and there was like

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:59.280
the sixth one and the second one where they're short packs kind of.

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:04.880
I vaguely remember it, except my mom kind of shielded me from the gremlin stuff.

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.840
I don't think she liked it.

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.440
Mom, I went with my friend's big sister to go see it.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.320
Because it was, you know, early PG-13.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:14.820
Yeah.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.160
I saw it when I was 11, I want to say.

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:24.960
But at any rate, they had this thing where, you know, with the Happy Meal,

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.080
you'd get a whole book and a little vinyl with it.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:32.320
Mine warped because someone left them in the back seat of the car.

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:39.760
But you can also unwarp an album pretty easily if it's flimsy enough.

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:46.160
So I had one that had wave patterns on them,

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:48.400
and we managed to get it flattened back out where it would work.

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:53.280
Didi Archaholic in chat, which, hello, great to see you again,

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.840
even when it's not the 20th anniversary, excited to have you back,

01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.560
says they were also three dimensional, talking about the Viewmaster.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.480
And that's what was so amazing, really.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:06.880
Yes, that's what it was, was that whole fact that it wasn't just a colorful picture

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:09.600
if you were holding it up to the light, but it was three dimensional as well.

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.160
Had that slightly different left and right photo.

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:15.680
So that's what kind of made me think of the stuff Jamie was talking about,

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:18.640
even though, yeah, I'm mixing up some things.

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.160
But hey, trip down memory lane. Viewmaster was great.

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:25.440
I found the Fisher Price movie viewer.

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:27.040
Yeah, they're talking about that in chat.

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:28.640
There's a link.

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:30.640
There's where you can buy one.

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:31.780
Wow.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.960
They still make them to this day.

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.120
Well, it was when they were doing the classic toys,

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:44.560
because they also had the telephone thingy and the little bubble vacuum thing

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:47.280
that had the little plastic balls that would shoot around.

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.600
And there's a Viewmaster and similar items, of course.

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.360
Uh huh.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:59.520
They also did like a they tried to use the Viewmaster name as well for like a mobile hand.

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.560
It's like, you know how the for a while there, like mobile VR was kind of popular

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:08.880
with all those different like Google cardboard and stuff like that.

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.040
So there's a lot of companies making really cheap

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:16.480
VR goggles, almost that you could strap to your phone.

01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:17.920
And Viewmaster did that.

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:19.220
OK.

01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:26.880
You know what's funny is that I just found an eBay auction where they're selling the old cartridges.

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:29.920
And so I can see the ones that I have.

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:33.360
So I actually had Lonesome Ghosts, which was a Disney one,

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:38.080
where Mickey, Donald and Goofy are ghost hunters.

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:44.960
I had the Sylvester and Tweety one, and I had the Roadrunner one.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:46.160
Wow.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.640
So those were the three that I had now that I'm looking at them.

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:50.740
All right.

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.160
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:54.080
I had I tripped on every lane.

01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:54.580
It's all good.

01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:58.480
I wish I could remember the cool Viewmasters I had, but it's been so long.

01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.680
Some various Disney ones.

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.320
I know that.

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.600
So all right.

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.480
This is great.

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:03.840
We should be so happy.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.880
We should go back to games, though, and talk about some rapid fire news.

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:09.600
Some other headlines around the industry a little quicker.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.100
Loki.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:16.000
You know, this is with all the crap we give Atari about, like some of their dumb projects

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.520
that they kick out, like the VCS and stuff like that.

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.280
This Atari anniversary collection is pretty awesome looking.

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.800
This Atari 50.

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.360
Yeah.

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:27.860
Yes.

01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:28.880
The Atari 50.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:30.560
It's the anniversary celebration.

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:37.200
They say it's got 90 games included with it from everything from the 2600 up through the

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.240
Jaguar, and they even include the Atari Lynx in there as well.

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.160
And not only does it.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:48.400
Yeah, not only does it have all of that, but it's got, you know, different folks talking

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:52.800
about the games, kind of like almost like a documentary type of thing with it.

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:58.240
And they've even created five new games to the collection as well.

01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.240
So digital clips is putting this together.

01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:03.920
And yeah, I'm actually kind of looking forward to that.

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:09.280
My only issue with this, because this sounds awesome, is I'm like, God, this is like 15

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:13.360
years past the time they should have done this and reinvented some of their class.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:16.480
This is long overdue, but you know what?

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.200
We'll take it.

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:20.800
And just the fact that I know Tempest 2000 is in this clip.

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:25.520
So the fact that like we're going to get like Jaguar in this as well and just some of those

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.760
awesome games, this looks really exciting, I got to say.

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:34.000
And I don't often say that about Atari like ever so anymore.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.280
So this is pretty cool.

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:36.080
Wait, wait, wait for it.

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.680
They say early classics.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:38.160
There it is.

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:38.560
There it is.

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.640
That's that's Tempest 2000 right there.

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.240
So very cool.

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:47.040
I freaking love Tempest 2000.

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:47.600
I know me too.

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.760
I'm like, that'll make it recharge.

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:51.200
That'll make it worth the money right there.

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.280
So what else, Loki?

01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:58.400
And then along with that, you know, we have a lot of game companies talking about what

01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.120
they're working on.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.920
Well, Sucker Punch is going to tell you what they're not working on.

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:07.120
And that is, of course, a new game in the Infamous and Sly Cooper franchise.

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.920
As right now, they said, as our games continue to grow in scale and complexity, they require

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:15.680
the full attention of our studios with a focus on our current project.

01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:18.720
We have no plans to revisit Infamous or Sly Cooper right now.

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:22.400
That doesn't mean forever, but just like right now, at least.

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:23.520
Yeah.

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.200
But games take a while to make.

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:25.520
Yeah.

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:29.200
And we had, I think, an Infamous and Sly Cooper game back on PlayStation 4.

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.400
It hasn't been that long.

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:30.900
Yeah.

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:32.960
So, all right.

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:34.080
Darsakura, what do you have for us?

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:38.240
Oh, some Sega Genesis stuff.

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.400
So there's four Sega Genesis games that were added to Nintendo Switch online.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.320
We have Mega Man, The Wily Wars.

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.720
We have Comic Zone.

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:52.000
We have Target Earth.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.800
And then, dun dun dun, Zero Wing, which had some of the best music and worst translation ever.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.840
Zero Wing is such a fucking good game, though.

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:08.720
And then, that was it for me.

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.000
Yep.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
But yeah, Zero Wing of the Infamous All Your Base Are Belong to Us meme.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.120
And nobody can remember, unless you're a classic gaming connoisseur like Darsakura,

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.400
what the actual game looked like.

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.600
But the game is fucking great.

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:28.240
But the music in it, the music is so good.

01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:28.740
Yeah.

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:30.100
Yeah.

01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:32.000
How dare it be that good?

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.840
And I am really excited for the Mega Man Wily Wars, too.

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:40.480
Even though, I don't know, some people took issue with the Genesis collection of it,

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.400
like, because, you know, it did some things differently.

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:45.440
But I just think it's a collection a lot of people kind of forget about.

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:51.760
And the fact that it kind of re-looked at Mario 1, 2, and 3 in a similar way that, like,

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:56.720
Mario All-Stars did, where it's like, it wasn't that long after the original releases, right?

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.000
So it's kind of neat.

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.360
So these are some good releases, that's for sure.

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.240
I'm excited about that.

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:02.740
Indeed.

01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:03.780
Yeah.

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:07.840
I still don't have the Nintendo Online Plus or whatever it's called.

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:10.560
I still haven't been convinced to upgrade to that, but maybe soon.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.060
We'll see.

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.080
All right.

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:15.920
Well, let's check out some releases coming out real soon around the world.

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.760
So, Loki, we'll start in the US.

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:19.300
Yes.

01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.920
So we have a game called Arcade Geddon,

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:27.680
which is on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.160
Eurokill, the culmination game.

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:37.920
And that's going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:44.320
Uh, Match Point Tennis Championships on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.880
PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:50.560
And, let's see, Ruins Magus on PC.

01:47:51.760 --> 01:48:00.000
AI, The Somnium Files, Nirvana Initiative on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:09.920
Klonoa Fantasy Reverie Series on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:17.040
Xbox Series, and then a game called Madison on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.640
and Xbox Series.

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.140
That's it.

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:20.800
Traveling to Japan.

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:23.120
It's kind of a quiet week on the Nintendo Switch.

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:26.400
Really, the only release this week is Klonoa Fantasy Reverie Series.

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:29.200
And that is coming out on July 7th.

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:31.920
But that is, like, the only release on the Switch this week.

01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.320
When you go to the PlayStation 5, you get Match Point Tennis Championships is coming out there,

01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:40.000
as well as that same Klonoa game is also out on the PlayStation 5.

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:43.040
But really, that seems to be it for the week.

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:46.320
It's a pretty quiet week in Japan, just those few releases.

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:50.080
I should point out, though, that PlayStation 4 is also getting those games.

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:53.840
So, also, FIFA 22 gets a price reduction.

01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:55.280
It goes into the best hits collection.

01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:01.280
But also on the PlayStation 4, there is a game called My Girlfriend is a Mermaid?

01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:01.920
Refine.

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.320
That is the name of the game.

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:06.400
My Girlfriend is a Mermaid?

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:14.160
So does she lure unwitting sailors to their deaths?

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.000
If the game is cool, then yes.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.480
But I have a feeling the game is probably not that cool.

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:27.040
I want to be a siren and lure unsuspecting men to their doom.

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:27.840
DJ Rama S says-

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:30.960
But only specifically old Republican men.

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:33.360
DJ Rama S says, probably a visual novel.

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.120
And I think, ding, ding, ding.

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:36.160
That is probably correct.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.720
How about the UK, Darsakra?

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:47.120
In the UK, on the 7th, for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, Match Point Tennis Championship Legends.

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:50.960
The rest of these are on the 8th for PlayStation and Switch.

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:53.120
We have Arcade Spirits, The New Challengers.

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:59.920
For those same two, plus Xbox, we have Klonoa Fantasy Reverie series.

01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:04.160
And then also on the 8th for PlayStation and Switch, we have Madison.

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.840
Looks like some sort of horror game.

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:10.320
All right, we have a few more stories for y'all.

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:15.040
And then we're going to get to some tweets and emails from last week that we ran out of time for.

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.120
And then maybe we'll try to squeeze in a call or two.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.240
Although I don't think we want to have another three and a half hour show tonight.

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:23.520
So we'll take what we have time for.

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:29.280
Because actually, we do have one recorded phone call I want to make sure we get to.

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.680
And I'll explain why we're doing that in a little bit.

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:34.880
But first, we have some more headlines.

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:35.280
Loki.

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:36.800
Yes.

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:42.880
So, you know, we always say to put your money where your mouth is when it comes to, you know,

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:46.880
trying to influence what happens in the game industry.

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:54.480
Well, someone took that to heart and apparently invested 5 million yen on Nintendo stock,

01:50:54.480 --> 01:51:00.880
which was enough to get them invited to the investor board.

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:09.760
And once they were there, they were able to ask a question about what's going on with F-Zero,

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:10.400
Nintendo.

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:18.080
And of course, they gave them basically like, eh, we all know.

01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:23.120
Was that the official comment?

01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:28.400
No, the official comment, the translated comment was it's realistically

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:32.240
difficult to develop new titles and remakes, including sequels for every

01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:34.000
Nintendo game that people request.

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:39.920
But we are very grateful and appreciative of the expectation of our fans have for our games.

01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:44.000
You know, that's that's 5 million yen well spent.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
I probably wouldn't have done that.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.560
I know it's like it's better spent than on crypto.

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:50.560
There's that.

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.200
True.

01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:51.700
Yeah.

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:55.760
Anyway, at least at least you still have that in shares.

01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:57.120
So it's still worth that.

01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:58.880
But it's like, you know, for good.

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.800
And I guess you could sell that later.

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:06.240
Just just to note for those that are watching live at Twitch, we are showing some B-roll of

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:11.760
F-Zero GX from the GameCube, just so you can remember what a fucking good game it was and

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.720
understand why somebody had to ask this question.

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:18.400
It is such a good game.

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.760
And Mike Deff says, don't worry about this guy losing money.

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.360
He's probably going to earn money.

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.400
Yeah, I mean, that's true.

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:25.600
He bought stock.

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.920
He didn't just throw it in the toilet to get this question.

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:31.760
So he'll probably actually end up making money on this.

01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:35.680
You know, if he can hold it to a point when, you know, Nintendo announces, you know,

01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.440
the release date for Breath of the Wild 2 or something like that, that's for sure.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.480
So remember, this is how you get a say in the company.

01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:43.680
That is it.

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:48.480
I mean, hey, this is a well, well played example.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:49.760
All right.

01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:51.120
I think we're over to Dark Soccer next.

01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:53.440
All right.

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:57.440
Well, we have some news for BioWare.

01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:04.880
They have hired the writer who worked on Deus Ex and Guardians of the Galaxy from Eidos

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:05.520
Montréal.

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:17.440
Mary Demarle, who was a long time person with Eidos Montréal, is now working with BioWare.

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:22.080
She is, I'm trying to double check something on here.

01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:29.040
The thought is that she may be with the New Dragon Age or Mass Effect game.

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:35.440
But I think it could be a good thing.

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:39.840
You know, both of those games were great, especially Guardians of the Galaxy.

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:43.200
You know, the writing for that was just top notch.

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:45.200
So I have high hopes.

01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.000
If she's in there for Mass Effect, I'm down.

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:54.240
Yeah, that Guardians of the Galaxy turned out a lot better than people thought it would.

01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:55.600
So it's good.

01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:56.880
Yeah.

01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:57.920
So pretty cool.

01:53:58.640 --> 01:53:59.360
Yeah.

01:53:59.360 --> 01:53:59.860
All right.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.320
Unfortunately, we have some sad news.

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:02.820
Loki?

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:04.580
Yes.

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:11.440
So unfortunately, this week we lost a very influential content creator by the name of

01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:14.880
Alex, who went by Technoblade.

01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:18.800
And he was a content creator for Minecraft, obviously.

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.800
Very well known for PvP.

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:26.400
He did a lot of stuff in Hypixel.

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:28.560
Had a really, you know, great following.

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.640
Just kind of a wholesome content creator.

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:37.440
Unfortunately, he lost the battle with Sarcoma and he passed away at the age.

01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:39.200
I think it was 23.

01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:39.520
Yeah.

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:39.920
Yes.

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.040
Just 23.

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.720
That's so, so sad.

01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:44.880
Yeah.

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:47.280
So it is very sad.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.560
Unfortunately, I never really watched his content.

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:55.440
I knew of him through kind of watching stuff Dream because he's kind of had like a friendly

01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:00.880
rivalry with him because they're both kind of, you know, into the PvP stuff like that.

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:07.520
So I was aware of him, but didn't know kind of, you know, the type of content that he

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:08.080
made stuff.

01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:13.360
But yeah, I mean, obviously everyone's kind of taken it very hard.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.440
They've lots of tributes.

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:24.320
Mojang actually put a crown on the pig in their like splash screen for the Minecraft

01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:29.920
launcher, which is very nice because his avatar was kind of this crowned pig, which

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:30.560
is kind of cool.

01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:32.640
That is a very nice gesture.

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:37.600
Yeah, it's just very, very, you know, sad.

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:43.920
Like the last video that was on his channel is actually his dad that was released talking

01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:48.560
about, you know, him dying and like all this stuff like he wanted to do.

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:54.240
Basically, like he wanted to put out a video to kind of tell the fans what was going on.

01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:00.720
So he was able to kind of write a short message for his fans and basically just passed away

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.480
about eight hours after that.

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:05.280
So yeah, very sad.

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:10.240
Yeah, I actually I'm not familiar with the content creator because I'm not as embedded

01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:13.760
in the Minecraft scene, certainly as much as you are, Loki or, you know, so forth.

01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:17.360
But I did watch because it was going around Twitter.

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:23.200
I did watch a little bit of that last video and like not even knowing the individual like

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:26.000
that last video was very, very impactful.

01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:30.720
And yeah, it's really just such a young age for that.

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:31.680
So, so sad.

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:37.200
So yeah, Darktucia says it's always nice to see devs doing that tip of the hat to one

01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:38.320
of their fans.

01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.760
I think I remember hearing something similar in WoW at one point.

01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:47.360
Yeah, Warcraft and I think some of the other MMOs, to be fair, have done like a character

01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:54.080
in the game is like memorialized in game, like as an actual NPC.

01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:59.120
Like I know I remember an old friend from the Hoard House days had a husband who had

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:00.240
passed away tragically.

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:05.920
And that husband is a Warcraft character in the Pandaren expansion that you can go visit.

01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:10.560
And I remember there was an episode of Hoard House where we talked about it a little bit

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:17.040
and, you know, kind of was an odd bit of comfort where he could go visit him in the virtual

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:21.840
space, which is just this very interesting thing that only gaming can really give us,

01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:24.880
which is very, very interesting.

01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:29.120
Unfortunately, I have no idea where to get that episode anymore because Hoard House doesn't

01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:30.000
need an archive.

01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:37.840
It was a great show for its time, but for its time.

01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:39.120
All right.

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:46.320
Anyhow, let's try to end on a little bit more of a lighthearted note and talk about this

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:52.720
is, oh boy, and actually I just have to correct, Rama and Chats is probably still on iTunes.

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:58.480
No servers long gone, and it has been removed from iTunes and pretty much any up to date

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:03.040
podcast directory because the MP3s are no longer available.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:04.560
There's that.

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.960
Oh, Pod Culture says I have the episodes on the server.

01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:10.160
If you all go find them, then cool.

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:14.480
But just please remember the disclaimer I talk about before you go listen to old Orange

01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:19.280
Launch Radio about content that doesn't always age gracefully because that is like double

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:20.480
so for Hoard House.

01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:26.320
Again, not ashamed of the content that we did because that was a really fun time with

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:26.880
my friends.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.960
But it's dated, so we've grown and learned.

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:31.440
Yes, we have.

01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:32.400
We've all grown and learned.

01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:32.720
All right.

01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:38.560
Anyhow, let's talk about some developers that haven't learned because they are still putting

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.400
out Smurfs games.

01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:44.160
And yes, we're going to have a Smurfs cart game that's going to be on the way.

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:50.800
This is a follow up to the Smurfs Mission belief, which is a platform adventure game.

01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:58.400
The French publisher Microids is going to be making a cart racing game called Smurfs

01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.120
Cart.

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:02.960
No, I don't have any footage to show you, and it's probably not really worth looking

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:03.600
at anyway.

01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:11.600
You can choose from such Smurfs as the main one, the one with the chef's hat Smurfette.

01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:15.120
I don't know if these are the actual names, but this article is calling them that, and

01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.880
I think it would be funny if those were the names.

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:20.160
But I do seem to remember there was like jokey Smurf and stuff, so I think some of them do

01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:20.960
have actual names.

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:24.800
My God, Rob, I'm just like now thinking of Teen Girl Squad.

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:27.440
How so?

01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:28.160
Cheerleader.

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:30.560
What's your so and so?

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:31.680
What's her face?

01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:32.560
The ugly one.

01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:40.400
So anyway, that game will be coming out, and I'm sure you are all running to go preorder

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:41.360
it right now.

01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:43.040
Smurfs Cart.

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:44.000
Yes, it's a thing.

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:45.360
Be ready for it.

01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:52.400
All right, we're going to move into the next segment, which we're going to do some continued

01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:55.680
talk and thank yous on the 20-year anniversary.

01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:02.400
So last week at the end of the show, you may recall that Dark Tetsuya was trying to call

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:06.800
us, and he was unable to get through because of some technical issues.

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:09.600
And I joked with Dark Tetsuya and I said, why don't you just make a video?

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:11.280
Well, guess what?

02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:13.840
Dark Tetsuya, in fact, made a video.

02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:19.040
Now, the only unfortunate thing here is due to the technical restrictions, my co-hosts

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:20.400
are not going to be able to hear the video.

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:22.320
They'll be able to see it, but they can't hear it.

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:23.600
So I'm really sorry, folks.

02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:27.440
But if I were to turn on the audio, it causes a feedback loop.

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:34.160
So that is an issue I have not been able to figure out yet, although I'm going to play

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:34.640
it here.

02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:38.080
You guys actually have the link in the show if you want to see it.

02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:41.680
But I will play it here and then we'll talk about it.

02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:46.560
So let me, because I'm still trying to set up behind the scenes here, let me bring it

02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:51.040
up and we're going to hear Dark Tetsuya giving some feedback and some memories.

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.080
Remember, Dark Tetsuya has been here since episode one.

02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.200
So let's get to this.

02:00:58.480 --> 02:00:59.360
Hey, what's up?

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:00.320
It's Dark Tetsuya.

02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:04.400
So yeah, the Discord call last Sunday was a bit of a disaster.

02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:08.640
Fortunately, Rob gave me the okay to just record something.

02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:09.760
So here I am.

02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:15.280
Man, I'm still kind of in shock that we just celebrated 20 years of doing a little Internet

02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.880
radio thing turned podcast.

02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:22.080
Feels like just yesterday I was sitting down at the computer that fateful Sunday night

02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.000
to listen to their first episode.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.520
I doubt any of us imagined we would still be here two decades later.

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:33.760
Anyway, I hope that little surprise from last Sunday was a hit with the longtime listeners.

02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:37.920
Or heck, even anyone, any of the newcomers that might be curious.

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:39.520
What was the show like back in the day?

02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:42.720
So now you can hear that one for yourself.

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:47.520
I was happy to be able to resurrect the archive for those fans that were curious.

02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:48.880
For the record, it was a mess.

02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:51.280
So the reaction to all that, it definitely made my night.

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:57.680
And y'all don't even want to know how many hours that repair job on episode two took.

02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:03.760
But after they did the revisit of the first episode back in 2019, yeah.

02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:04.800
Or no, it was 2020.

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:05.300
Not it.

02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:07.920
2021.

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:08.560
It was last year.

02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:10.400
What is time anymore?

02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:10.720
All right.

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:11.760
Yeah.

02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:13.920
Anyway, I knew I had to fix it before the 20th, so.

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.400
And I guess it turns out that that bowling alley from our first story, they'd finally

02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:22.080
torn it down a couple of years ago.

02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:30.240
So yeah, I guess I'll have the memories on that one.

02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:31.120
Rest in piss.

02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:34.560
As for my other favorite memories, I guess I have three of them.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.400
Of course, the shenanigans during episode 69 were busted out Carrick Revolution and

02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:46.480
just, and everybody sang that that was a wild time.

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:47.920
Poor Loki though.

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:50.720
I still feel kind of bad.

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:52.160
He did not want to do it.

02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:55.280
He was just not into it.

02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:57.300
But.

02:02:58.560 --> 02:02:58.880
Okay.

02:02:58.880 --> 02:02:59.120
Okay.

02:02:59.120 --> 02:02:59.920
I have to pause here.

02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:00.720
I have to pause here.

02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:03.360
Dark Tetsuya brought up, because I know you can't hear Loki.

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:06.400
He brought up, he's going through his favorite moments in the show's history.

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:11.040
And of course, you know, a person has been listening since episode one brought up episode

02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:19.440
69 when you did karaoke revolution and did your own rendition of I'm going out or whatever

02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:20.480
the song was called originally.

02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:21.920
But you changed the lyrics.

02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:26.240
And again, it's one of those things that may be questionably his age, but you know what?

02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:30.160
I'm going to give you a pass because it was funny, Loki.

02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:30.400
Okay.

02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:33.840
If you did, if you did, I don't think it was that funny.

02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:36.000
I, but the listeners thought it was great.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.920
So, but he's saying Loki didn't want to do it.

02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:40.800
He didn't want to do it.

02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:43.440
So can we, did you want to sing?

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:44.320
Did you, were you?

02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:45.920
No, I did not want to.

02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:48.980
Okay.

02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:51.120
I'm glad we got that settled.

02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:51.600
Okay.

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:56.080
Let's let me go back to the special message here from Dark Tetsuya.

02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:56.480
I don't know.

02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:57.840
It was still kind of a fun time.

02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:01.440
So, and then there was that time.

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:03.520
It was one of our earliest episodes.

02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:05.440
We had barely gotten into the double digits.

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:10.400
It was 10 and a half because it was a pre-taped thing at the arcade there, Roseville Golf Land.

02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:16.400
So we thought we'd go down there, record the episode and, you know, just walk around, play

02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:18.160
some of the games and all that.

02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:22.240
It was going okay for a while, but then the management stopped us.

02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:27.280
So then we had to wait and find out where we, were we going to get in trouble?

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:28.640
Was management going to kick us out?

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:30.000
We'd have to go to dinner early.

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:36.800
Luckily it turned out, they just said, you guys can stay, but you got to go back upstairs.

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:43.920
So we decided to just, we'll just take it and go back upstairs to finish out the show.

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:47.520
So it did inspire me to do a clip show.

02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:53.920
So for those that weren't here for episode 10 and a half recorded live at Roseville Golf

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.360
Land, well, not live, no, not live.

02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:57.520
It was recorded and then played later.

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:01.280
The management almost shut us down.

02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:05.600
And that was really funny because I remember lying and saying that we were doing a project

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:06.800
for high school or something.

02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:07.920
And they were like, what school?

02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:11.680
And I named my, because I went to school in Roseville, so I knew the high schools there.

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:15.680
And so they were kind of giving us like a face, like, and I'm sure it was the whole,

02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:17.040
you look too old to be in high school.

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:20.640
Keep in mind, I was 24 at the time, so I maybe could pass a little better.

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:26.400
Um, but yeah, it was just, it was, uh, it was a funny moment, uh, when the show almost

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:30.320
got stopped in its tracks at Golf Land, but yeah, they didn't, they didn't end up, they

02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:32.560
didn't end us, end up throwing us out.

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:34.080
I mean, cause like, what were they going to do?

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:34.880
Call the police?

02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:38.720
Like we would have been out of there before the police ever got there, but that was true.

02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:41.440
We don't get paid enough to care.

02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:41.840
That's right.

02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:44.720
That's, and that ultimately that's what it is at the end of the day.

02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:46.480
They don't get paid enough to care.

02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:49.840
Let me let, uh, Dark to see it finish his video message here.

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:50.400
Sorry.

02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:51.760
I keep, sorry, dark soccer.

02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:55.200
I keep cutting in, um, but lovely hair.

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:55.520
All right.

02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:59.680
Let me go back to the length of the other wig.

02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:00.400
I understand.

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:00.640
Okay.

02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:03.040
Here's the last minute or so of the message.

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:04.960
Cause Robin made the comment about it.

02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:08.240
I just, just was something I'd always had in the back of my mind.

02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:09.600
It's like, Oh, I got to do that.

02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:13.760
So yeah, that was kind of funny.

02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:22.320
And I'm probably biased with the number one, but back in 2017, it was January.

02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:30.880
And I had, I had gotten to come down and see the one who'd be my eventual wife, Michigan's.

02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:35.200
So we were hanging out and the,

02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:39.760
Oh gosh.

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:40.240
Yeah.

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:45.760
It was, it was that Nintendo, not E3, but like the direct thing and that's in the switch

02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:46.880
and some of the upcoming games.

02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:51.200
So we called in, you have our thoughts on that and talk about the new Zelda coming out.

02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:54.000
Seeing how we couldn't wait to get ahold of that.

02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:58.240
I think we also talked a bit about that shadow run game.

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:01.280
Cause she was pretty into it.

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:02.480
So that sounds right.

02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:08.160
That was a pretty happy memory for us.

02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:09.920
So that we could share that with the show.

02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:14.800
Anyway, thanks for giving me the chance to get my take on our

02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:17.520
anniversary as turning 20 years old.

02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:20.400
Happy anniversary to y'all now.

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:21.440
Send it back to you guy.

02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:22.820
Y'all.

02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:26.160
So I will see you in chat.

02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:28.160
All right.

02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:28.880
Thank you so much.

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:30.560
Start to see her for sending that in.

02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:31.360
Appreciate it.

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.040
And the little walk down memory lane.

02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:37.600
Even if you are a little biased in your number one answer there,

02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:39.520
but I completely understand why.

02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:42.720
And that would be when him and me called into the show together.

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:47.040
I think before they kind of got together together.

02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:48.320
So pretty cool.

02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:52.640
Especially hearing from somebody who was there the very first night,

02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:54.800
walking down some old memories.

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:57.040
As Joe and Hunter Matt mentions,

02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:00.880
I went back and read through a lot of the forums a week or so ago.

02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:03.280
And wow, that was a trip down memory lane as well.

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:03.920
That's true.

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:09.520
Our website really is frozen in time since 2000 something.

02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:13.520
So there's a lot of I bet there's some great forum posts.

02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:16.640
There are some people that we haven't heard from in a very long time.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:20.080
That should be a fun read sometime.

02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:21.840
I need to do that as well.

02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:23.040
So cool.

02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:29.280
All right, I think we have some emails that also speak to the anniversary.

02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:33.360
So let me kick it over to DarkSakura who opens up our mailbag.

02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:38.320
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and read some emails for us.

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:44.080
All right, so I'm going to go in date order of reception.

02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:46.640
So this one comes from Name & Lights.

02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:50.080
Congratulations on 20 years.

02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:52.720
I have been a listener since the All Games days.

02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:55.760
So I am not a day one OLR listener.

02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:00.240
I'm not able to listen to the show live because of the day and time you are on,

02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:02.880
but have been a podcast listener since I found this show.

02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:07.680
You have had so many great moments over the last 20 years.

02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:12.480
I will always remember this show in 2013 when I called in after my wife passed away.

02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:16.240
It was really rough time for me and I nearly lost everything.

02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:18.480
I will never forget the support I got.

02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:20.880
Things did get better and I am in a great place now.

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:24.640
I have messaged you all offline for things over the years

02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:26.320
and are very easy to talk to.

02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:31.200
I am on the East Coast so the chance of meeting any of you in person is very hard,

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:32.160
but maybe someday.

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:36.000
I have met Xtaphir on a trip to North Carolina.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.480
Without OLR that would not have happened.

02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:39.760
Thanks for all the years.

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:46.160
I won't say here's to 20 more because that number is getting too big and I will be way too old.

02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:51.200
I will say I will be a listener to OLR until the day you do close your doors and shut down the feed.

02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:55.840
Can I cry?

02:09:57.360 --> 02:09:58.080
If you want to.

02:09:58.080 --> 02:09:58.720
It's your party.

02:09:58.720 --> 02:09:59.680
You can cry if you want to.

02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:02.400
It's a very sweet email.

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:08.800
I actually recall that episode that you mentioned because it was very tricky for me trying to

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:13.920
navigate that and I mean that just in the way of I wanted you to have a place where you could

02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:20.080
talk about it openly, but at the same time I was just a little worried like, oh gosh,

02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:25.600
is he putting too much of that emotion and rawness out there, but at the same time

02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:31.760
I think sometimes we all need a space and a place to do that and I'm glad you're able to do that.

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:42.800
While I can't say I understand, I don't, but I'm glad we were able to give you that space

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:44.800
to process that.

02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:48.320
I'm glad that you've made some great friendships through the show as well.

02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:51.840
It's great having you here and thank you so much for being a part of the show and the

02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:52.640
legacy of the show.

02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:59.760
I am, by the way, saving these emails as PDFs for something I still want to work on.

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.680
Moving on to the next one is from Ziba.

02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:07.120
Hello.

02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:09.520
I can't believe it's been 20 years.

02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:11.760
I remember my first day like it was yesterday.

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:13.440
It was around 2009.

02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:18.000
I was searching for a new video game music shoutcast radio station because my original

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.080
one I was listening to stopped working.

02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:24.640
I came across OLR's website and started listening to the 24-7 stream.

02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.520
I was happy to find out that the stream was not only VGM but other geeky songs too.

02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:35.280
I made my way to the IRC room and said how happy I was to find a new shoutcast radio station.

02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:40.000
Someone in chat, I don't remember who, told me that I should come back on Sunday night

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.360
for a live show.

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.000
I don't remember the exact episode I started on.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:47.600
However, I do have so many fond memories of the years I've been listening.

02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:52.960
All those times, Rob pressed the wrong button and Holik and the FUs of the Week music would

02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:56.480
play and the Laughing Ferret, the Vuvuzela.

02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:00.720
All the times, Dark Sakura would say, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:01.600
All the cage ma...

02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:03.540
Rob!

02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:05.060
What?

02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:06.420
Nothing.

02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:09.200
All the cage matches and Listless.

02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:16.080
All of Loki's rants, President Cat, all of the food tangents and probably so much more

02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:18.320
that I can't think of off the top of my head.

02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:23.680
I'm so happy that I was able to meet Rob, Bobby Blackwolf and some listeners in real life.

02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:26.160
You have made a great community over the years.

02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:30.160
Even though I cannot stay for the live show most of the time, I'm glad that I can still

02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:32.720
listen to the podcast the next day while I work.

02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.800
Here's to the next 20 years.

02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:36.400
Congrats, Ziba.

02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:37.600
So great to hear from you, Ziba.

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:41.440
And yeah, I met you at MAGFest and it was great.

02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:43.200
I'm so glad we got to meet up.

02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:50.720
And you probably had told me that you found the station the way you did, but honestly,

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:51.360
I forgot.

02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:55.120
And hearing it again just kind of makes me go, oh, like just hearing the ways that people

02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:56.720
kind of discover you is very interesting.

02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:00.960
And then it kind of, you know, I know you've also talked a lot about like OC Remix and

02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:04.080
that type of stuff to me and helped me discover stuff over there.

02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:07.840
So it's just it's neat how that all comes full circle.

02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:09.360
So that's awesome.

02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:11.680
Well, thank you for being a part of our community all these years.

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:13.680
Indeed.

02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:18.320
Last email, which is also one from earlier today.

02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:22.000
Hi, Rob, Jamie and Loki.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.200
Happy post 20th.

02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:27.200
Normally I'd say happy fourth, but given the state of this country, is it really happy?

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:27.440
No.

02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:28.640
Is it though?

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:35.200
Anyway, I wanted to say a couple of things that I could not during the two minute countdown.

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:40.720
One, last week wasn't just OLR's 20th anniversary and your birthday, but it was also the birthday

02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:44.560
of my first nephew, a close friend of mine who was like a sister to me.

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:45.840
I even call her my sister.

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:50.320
Gave birth to a bouncing baby boy named Alex at six forty six a.m.

02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:53.520
Good things happen in three, as I'll tell you, too.

02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:57.440
I know you have said from time to time the show gets political.

02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:58.160
I digress.

02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:03.520
Can you really call it political when the views you bring up?

02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:06.880
We all agree on what you say, even if we don't.

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:10.640
Everyone in the army is adult enough to have a civil conversation about it.

02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:13.760
It only gets political when we are screaming at each other about it.

02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:18.320
No, it's still politics.

02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:21.200
We just have civil political conversations.

02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:21.700
Yeah.

02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:22.740
Yeah.

02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:25.760
The topic is is political.

02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:28.560
Yeah, I get the compliment that's buried in there.

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:29.040
I do.

02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:31.280
But yeah, I think what Jamie said is right.

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:31.780
Yeah.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:32.640
Yeah.

02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:34.720
Oh, and congrats, by the way, about your nephew.

02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:35.220
Yeah, for sure.

02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:40.580
So three, I was inspired by Dark Tetsuya to do something last week.

02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:46.180
Unfortunately, I was not able to finish it in time due to various things popping up at home.

02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:49.780
Don't worry, I am OK, but you know how it is when your hobbies get the best of you.

02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:55.220
I'd like to present the Orange Challenge Radio 20th anniversary ending credits.

02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:55.720
What?

02:14:57.060 --> 02:15:01.620
Don't worry, I'm working on a 16 bit version if you don't want to use the end theme.

02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:05.620
I hope you like it like the subtle surprises I put in there.

02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:09.060
So stay tuned at the end of the show tonight.

02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:12.820
We have a brand new outro, so stay tuned.

02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:14.840
Totally.

02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:19.060
I hope you like because I had fun working on it.

02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:20.180
Well, that's it.

02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:23.860
Take care and to quote VX Jason XV, see you next week.

02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:27.060
That's from DJ Rodman S.

02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:32.820
You have to make sure you also say it the way that Jason says it.

02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:33.460
That's what I did.

02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:33.940
See you next week.

02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:35.140
No, I know you did.

02:15:35.140 --> 02:15:37.940
But I'm telling everybody else out there, when you say that, make sure you're saying

02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:41.620
it the way Jason says it and see you next week.

02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:46.340
You know, you have to make sure you in that very I know we don't use the Chrono Trigger

02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:51.060
music anymore, but I still think of it when I hear see you next week.

02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:53.460
It's very, very nice with that.

02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:56.500
So Bobby is commenting.

02:15:56.500 --> 02:16:02.820
He saw that all going down, meaning the new intro coming in and out during the last.

02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:06.500
It was actually because it all Dropbox is how we all pass files to each other.

02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:10.580
And Bobby was live at Dropbox is like downloading the new new outro.

02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:13.140
Not once, but twice because Rama had to fix something.

02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:18.260
This is why I don't have my Dropbox sync.

02:16:19.380 --> 02:16:22.100
I go to the website and get it when I want it.

02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:25.140
That's the sink is so damn convenient, though.

02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:28.980
And it like to be to be fair, that never happens.

02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:33.300
But like once in 100 episodes, like something will be moved at the last minute.

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:38.420
Given the amount of stuff that I do through various cloud services.

02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:39.060
Yeah, it's different.

02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:39.700
That's different.

02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:45.620
Yeah, I keep them all online because I basically when I'm not working, I'm streaming.

02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:50.740
Yeah, I'm like, I'm like Rita in Power Rangers.

02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:51.620
Make my channel great.

02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:56.420
I'm going to chat as a show on how to Matt.

02:16:56.420 --> 02:16:57.140
And thank you for the email.

02:16:57.140 --> 02:17:01.620
Rama as a show on how to Matt and chat says I listened to the 20th anniversary show afterwards,

02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:03.540
and it brought back so many good memories.

02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:06.900
I'm a little sad I missed it live, but the memories were wonderful to hear.

02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:11.540
I'm so happy to be part of this wonderful community for so long from all the in jokes

02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:12.500
over the years.

02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:19.300
Peep jousting, Ultra Kade kicking President Kat and of course, Loki is Tingle from all

02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:25.220
the various homes live through 65 all games from all the in person meetups.

02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:27.060
Thank you for the memories and the fun times.

02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:28.340
Well, thank you for the sweet message.

02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:28.980
Appreciate it.

02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:31.060
I also want to I don't remember.

02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:33.060
Tingle is now officially in our album art.

02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:33.620
That is true.

02:17:34.900 --> 02:17:39.220
I want to get to some tweets because I didn't read the tweets last.

02:17:39.220 --> 02:17:42.980
I don't usually read all the tweets unless like one like I'm like, Oh, we have to talk

02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:43.620
about this.

02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:45.860
But there were a lot of very sweet things written on Twitter.

02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:47.220
So I just want to get to some of these.

02:17:47.220 --> 02:17:51.380
I may not get to them all because unfortunately our mentions can be kind of a mess.

02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:56.020
So if I skipped you, I'm sorry, but please know it was seen and I appreciate all the

02:17:56.020 --> 02:17:56.900
notes.

02:17:56.900 --> 02:18:01.780
But I do want to say at Blue Swim tweeted happy 20th anniversary to the podcast that

02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:03.700
made me want to become a podcaster.

02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:10.100
I remember listening to episodes on my Sony mini disc player back around 2005.

02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:12.580
So I've been there for most of those two decades.

02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:16.340
Congrats, Dark Sakura, Robin, Loki on the mini disc player.

02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:19.700
So does that mean you were burning episodes to a disc to listen?

02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:21.460
I know there were people that did that.

02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:24.420
They would download the MP3, then burn it to a disc and listen to it on the disc.

02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:26.820
Any discs were rewritable.

02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:30.260
Yeah, it's more like a zip drive, but smaller.

02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:32.100
Yeah, that was.

02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:39.940
And honestly, the mini disc format was a really good format, but it went the same direction

02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:41.620
that the Betamax did.

02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:45.460
Great technology, superior format.

02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:47.540
No one wanted to adopt it.

02:18:47.540 --> 02:18:48.980
Yeah, like memory stick.

02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:53.780
All right, so the next one is a Twitter thread.

02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:55.460
So it's three tweets I have to read.

02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:58.340
So it's a little long, but it's great.

02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:03.620
Garth the Wolf tweeted and said a huge congrats to OLR and their 20th anniversary of being

02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:05.540
a gaming podcast live show.

02:19:05.540 --> 02:19:09.860
I've been listening to them most of my life when I discovered them off a DDR forum back

02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:10.740
in junior high.

02:19:14.260 --> 02:19:18.740
I just want to say I'm pretty sure he's like in his 30s now, but I'm going to have a child

02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:19.940
going into junior high.

02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:27.140
Hey, my cat is old enough to be a fifth grader, I think.

02:19:28.980 --> 02:19:31.220
And DDR forum, shout out to DDR Freak.

02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:33.140
It's okay to call out DDR Freak by name.

02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:34.180
Rest in peace.

02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:34.500
All right.

02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:36.020
I watched them evolve.

02:19:36.020 --> 02:19:37.460
There's a mod there, so yeah.

02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:41.140
Yeah, well, he did just say DDR forum.

02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:45.380
To be fair, it could have been like Bamani style or DDR spot or one of those other sites.

02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:46.020
It could have been.

02:19:46.020 --> 02:19:49.860
It could have, you know, there were other forums.

02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:56.580
Anyway, I watched them evolve as a show from live 365 to all games, then VOG and Twitch.

02:19:57.380 --> 02:20:00.340
They're more than just a podcast I look forward to hearing every week.

02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:04.420
The hosts of the show have legitimately given me advice on growing up as a young, confused

02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:07.220
gay kid who is afraid of not being accepted.

02:20:07.220 --> 02:20:09.380
They didn't need to do that, but they did.

02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:13.140
They use their show to elevate the voices of others in the gaming community in the best

02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:14.180
way possible.

02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:18.100
They treat their listeners like family and won't shy away from touchy subjects that need

02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:18.900
to be talked about.

02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:23.060
I'll just refer to the opening of our 20th anniversary episode.

02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:25.700
Here's to 20 more years.

02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:28.900
Yes, 20 love y'all with a heart emoji.

02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:29.780
Thank you so much for that.

02:20:29.780 --> 02:20:31.380
That is really, really kind.

02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:31.780
Thank you.

02:20:34.420 --> 02:20:35.220
Let's see.

02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:37.940
Going back to why does Twitter default to the wrong view?

02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:39.620
Okay, Sturlock.

02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:43.300
Man, I can't believe OLR is turning 20.

02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:48.100
I've been listening since 2007, and while I'm not as active as I used to be and mostly

02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:50.260
lurk now, I still love them.

02:20:50.260 --> 02:20:51.140
Well, thank you for that.

02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:51.780
I appreciate that.

02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:52.180
And you know what?

02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:53.780
I never liked this tweet.

02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:55.220
So there I'm going to like that tweet.

02:20:55.220 --> 02:20:59.060
And now you're going to see that, like, why did OLR like this tweet like two weeks later?

02:20:59.060 --> 02:21:02.100
Well, because I just realized I forgot to heart it.

02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:08.820
Dungeon Buster says, happy anniversary, OLR, from the days of side talk and engage the

02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:12.980
rise of streaming and the arrival of achievements on through to the present.

02:21:12.980 --> 02:21:18.580
For 20 years, these friends continue to share fun insights on generations of games and hardware

02:21:18.580 --> 02:21:20.900
to the future and beyond.

02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:26.260
And there's a lovely tweet or there's a lovely picture that goes with this that I think maybe

02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:28.180
ties into the Engage comment.

02:21:28.180 --> 02:21:29.140
Let me show you that there.

02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:33.460
There's the picture that goes with that.

02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:38.020
So a lovely cat listening to our show there on the Game Boy Advance, which I'm not even

02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:39.060
sure is possible.

02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:41.780
Okay, let's see.

02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:44.340
And then Pod Culture said, OLR turns 20.

02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:47.300
If you like fun and video games is the podcast to listen to.

02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:50.980
They had a huge influence on the run of Pod Culture.

02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:54.820
Let's see other tweets here.

02:21:57.380 --> 02:22:02.820
Infendo Justin tweeted and said, I'm sad that I've not had the opportunity to listen to

02:22:02.820 --> 02:22:07.780
OLR in years, but it has always been an amazing podcast made by amazing people.

02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:12.820
And I can only hope that the current run of Infendo Radio lasts half as long.

02:22:12.820 --> 02:22:14.980
Congrats, Jamie, Rob and Loki.

02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:22.980
And then some feedback after the podcast went up, Night of Dorks, who's actually an IRL

02:22:22.980 --> 02:22:29.220
friend of ours who is there at Golf Land back in the old days, tweeted us and said, hey,

02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:33.460
y'all, listening to last night's show and I wanted to say how proud I am of you and

02:22:33.460 --> 02:22:34.580
what you do.

02:22:34.580 --> 02:22:38.020
Much love and miss seeing y'all every week at RVGL.

02:22:39.220 --> 02:22:40.100
Thank you for the tweet.

02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:40.900
It's very nice.

02:22:41.540 --> 02:22:44.900
But are you missing much by not going to RVGL?

02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:48.100
Because I don't think you are like it isn't what you remember anymore.

02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:50.100
It's it's fair.

02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:56.020
And the other day around one day, there's probably nothing for us at Scandia anymore

02:22:56.020 --> 02:22:56.520
either.

02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:00.420
I'm having gone to Scandia not that long ago.

02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:01.960
Yeah.

02:23:02.420 --> 02:23:06.980
The only thing it's less crowded than I remember it.

02:23:07.940 --> 02:23:13.860
And I swear that like shooting gallery thing that they had there is much smaller than I

02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:14.660
remember it being.

02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:19.940
But yeah, it's it's different now.

02:23:19.940 --> 02:23:22.420
They have roller coasters or roller coaster.

02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:25.780
They have a roller coaster?

02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:26.980
They have a roller coaster.

02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:32.660
Like like a kitty one or like a like a wild mouse or something?

02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:35.860
It's I don't know what it's necessary.

02:23:36.020 --> 02:23:38.420
It's like the goofy flight school.

02:23:38.420 --> 02:23:39.460
I don't know what they have.

02:23:39.460 --> 02:23:40.740
They have a wild mouse.

02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:42.100
Yeah, I think that's what it's called.

02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:43.620
Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:49.220
I've been watching a lot of things about roller coasters lately, like especially like the

02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:52.980
physics behind them, because, you know, I get on random tangents of things that interest

02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:53.480
me.

02:23:54.180 --> 02:24:01.060
And I have now learned what different kinds of roller coasters are called from super loopers

02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:04.500
to the wild mouse model to all kinds of things.

02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:09.780
Yeah, I was taking the kids there for a little bit and they have a bunch of like different

02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:11.620
like carnival rides and stuff like that.

02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:14.980
It's just kind of like a weird hodgepodge of things.

02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:20.420
I might have to go then, although I'm not going on the the Scandia screamer out of spite

02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:24.020
that and mortal fear for my life.

02:24:24.020 --> 02:24:25.780
I want to get a couple other chat comments here.

02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:28.820
And then I see we have a caller who didn't get in last week in the green room.

02:24:28.820 --> 02:24:30.420
And I absolutely would like to hear from this person.

02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:31.620
So I'm going to get to that.

02:24:31.620 --> 02:24:33.620
But first, a couple of comments from chat.

02:24:33.620 --> 02:24:39.460
Phoenix 7726 says, O.L.R. is a lot of the reason I could tell that Gamergate was horseshit

02:24:39.460 --> 02:24:44.500
when it happened, because you all were talking about actual ethics in games journalism forever.

02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:46.660
And you showed me what that actually looks like.

02:24:47.300 --> 02:24:47.700
Thank you.

02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:52.340
That's actually quite a compliment, because, you know, that whole scenario was a mess,

02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:54.980
to put it extremely simply and lightly.

02:24:56.260 --> 02:25:00.820
And I'm glad that we could kind of help people sort right from wrong in that situation.

02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:02.660
That actually really does mean a lot.

02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:06.500
And then there were a couple of comments about round one as opposed to Roseville Golf Land.

02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:06.900
Guess what?

02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:11.380
I went to the I actually was at the Roseville Galleria yesterday because we happen to be

02:25:11.380 --> 02:25:12.340
going through the area.

02:25:13.700 --> 02:25:18.340
My husband and I have to get our both of us have to get our wedding rings resized.

02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:20.420
I think I might have mentioned this on the show a couple of weeks ago.

02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:24.340
My wedding ring straight up fell off in the shower and almost went down the drain

02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:25.460
because of the weight loss.

02:25:25.460 --> 02:25:28.260
So I actually my pain very well.

02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:31.940
Yeah, so I actually went down a ring size.

02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:33.300
It turns out I found out.

02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:36.740
So the place we got our rings happens to be over by the Galleria.

02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:39.780
So we went there and still not open.

02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:45.780
So even though they said round one was going to be the spring and then June 2022,

02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:50.100
nope, somebody lied to us because I was there on July 2 and it still wasn't open.

02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:53.700
And there's still just the fake wall up that you can't even see through it.

02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:56.500
Like, I can't see what they're doing in there because they have like a fake wall up.

02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:58.660
And it just says coming 2022.

02:25:59.220 --> 02:26:04.340
The movie theater upstairs is hopping and running, though, because that used to be Sears.

02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:06.980
So it used to be a two-story Sears.

02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:10.260
So now the top story is Cinemark or something in the bottom floor.

02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:15.380
You would think that like the top story would be round one and the bottom story would be,

02:26:15.380 --> 02:26:16.980
you know, the movie theater.

02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:19.780
Not with a bowling alley.

02:26:19.780 --> 02:26:21.940
You don't want that above.

02:26:23.380 --> 02:26:24.500
When you really think about it.

02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:26.580
No, no, you don't want that above the movie theater.

02:26:28.420 --> 02:26:32.020
Plus, the shaking of the movie theater base would like knock the pins over.

02:26:34.180 --> 02:26:35.140
So it probably wouldn't work.

02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:36.580
All right.

02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:40.980
But I'm excited to check out that round one whenever they actually fucking open.

02:26:40.980 --> 02:26:45.940
Anyway, we have a long time listener and participant of our show and somebody who the

02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:47.780
show would not be possible without in our green room.

02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:49.940
And I'm definitely bringing this person on the show.

02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:52.260
So let's get to the phones.

02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:53.700
Hi, you're on Orange Tons radio.

02:26:53.700 --> 02:26:54.100
Who's this?

02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:57.540
Well, I guess with that lead in, I got not terribly long ago.

02:26:57.540 --> 02:26:59.620
I have to say, see you next week.

02:27:01.220 --> 02:27:02.100
No, see you.

02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:03.460
See you this week.

02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:04.100
See you this week.

02:27:04.100 --> 02:27:05.300
See you right fricking now.

02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:07.620
Hey, Jason, it's great to hear from you.

02:27:07.620 --> 02:27:08.660
What's on your mind, my friend?

02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:11.700
Well, you said you didn't want another three and a half hour show.

02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:14.900
How about I bring up a topic that'll take us to like four and a half to five hours?

02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:16.420
Okay, sure.

02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:17.460
Do your worst.

02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:18.980
No, absolutely wouldn't.

02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:29.220
Um, I, um, was, I rewrote the intro at least three or four times on figuring out how exactly

02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:34.500
how to present the point that I was making and also cutting out a lot of my commentary

02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:39.220
because that doesn't lend itself to 30 seconds, particularly well.

02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:46.260
Um, I, but you do a fabulous job with those intros and I know, I know you rewrite them

02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:49.380
often because I have the text messages to back that up.

02:27:49.380 --> 02:27:50.100
You always do it.

02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:51.540
You always come out winning in the end.

02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:53.380
Thank you very much for that.

02:27:53.940 --> 02:28:03.220
I think that crunch culture already has been, but is going to, is officially a evergreen,

02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:08.580
actually, I think, uh, probably better said as a wedge issue to use the correct political term.

02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:13.620
Uh, it, it is the, it is the modern political wedge issue of gaming.

02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:19.140
Um, I, when is crunch culture?

02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:19.640
Okay.

02:28:23.140 --> 02:28:30.420
When you're talking about the serial captain crunch, occasionally sparingly.

02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:33.380
And when people want to do it because they want the money.

02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:34.740
Yeah.

02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:42.020
So in the intro I dropped in the, uh, I dropped in Matt booty saying, uh, putting the emphasis

02:28:42.100 --> 02:28:43.780
on the wrong details.

02:28:43.780 --> 02:28:46.340
Um, I agree with unionization.

02:28:46.340 --> 02:28:50.420
I agree that complaints are no doubt substantiated.

02:28:50.420 --> 02:28:58.580
Um, but I also think that, uh, and, and, uh, uh, booty's deflection of it was all correct,

02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:02.900
but there's another, there is one key word that at least was quoted in the article.

02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:07.700
You know, I didn't, I didn't go deeper into the source just for my own purposes of reading

02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:11.620
at the time he used the word bullying.

02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:20.740
And that's really understated in crunch culture because especially in particular, like I'm

02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:25.620
reasonably certain, uh, rockstar when they were talking, when they had their retrospective

02:29:25.620 --> 02:29:31.780
on red dead redemption to every successful game talks about the crunch that developers

02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:34.820
put in to, to finishing the product.

02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:41.780
Um, and I consider myself up until a couple of years ago for a couple of significant reasons,

02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:48.020
I consider myself all in on crunching and I am happy to do it.

02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:52.580
And I understand other people who want to put in their time and get the hell out because

02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:53.780
they want family.

02:29:53.780 --> 02:29:55.540
They have their, they have their family.

02:29:55.540 --> 02:29:59.860
They have to attend to, or because they want extracurriculars that aren't work or because

02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:01.380
they have a life outside of work.

02:30:02.020 --> 02:30:06.820
I, you know, you think about the whole thing broadly, the fact that crunch culture, uh,

02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:14.340
is, is frequently discussed in Japanese cultures and not even remotely to the same extent,

02:30:14.340 --> 02:30:16.260
not as prevalently in America.

02:30:16.820 --> 02:30:23.540
And like, uh, there, there was the, the Google engineer that in San Francisco that didn't

02:30:23.540 --> 02:30:28.020
have a house and just bought a, bought a van, a moving truck, something like that, and slept

02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:31.940
in the parking lot and could go back into work to use whatever facilities he needed.

02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:39.540
Like campuses, all of this, all of this stuff that you would call crunch exists everywhere.

02:30:39.540 --> 02:30:41.780
Some by choice, some not.

02:30:41.780 --> 02:30:48.100
And the problem is the, the, the definitive, uh, no, that's the wrong word.

02:30:48.100 --> 02:30:54.820
The objective problem is bullying forced over time, et cetera.

02:30:54.820 --> 02:31:01.620
The subjective problem is, Oh, if I don't do this, I'm going to be out of a job.

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:03.940
Do they feel that?

02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:05.540
Was it implied?

02:31:05.540 --> 02:31:11.380
Is it their own, um, uh, their own hangups from previous jobs?

02:31:11.380 --> 02:31:12.180
Something like that.

02:31:12.180 --> 02:31:20.500
Like it's so unfortunate that all of those possibilities exist, but depending on who

02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:25.620
presents it, it's going to be, and, and the personal, the, the, the belief of the person

02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:32.740
reading the article that it's only ever going to be the one thing to them and not the everything.

02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:43.140
So what do we, what do we do moving forward saying that, you know, should, should, I mean,

02:31:43.140 --> 02:31:48.100
yeah, some, some people are gonna want to crunch, especially if like overtime pay is involved.

02:31:48.100 --> 02:31:50.020
You know, some people want the money, they want to do it.

02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:51.540
But not everybody does.

02:31:52.260 --> 02:31:55.940
So where, where do we find the can or can, yeah.

02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:57.540
Or, you know, for a variety of reasons.

02:31:57.540 --> 02:31:58.260
Right.

02:31:58.260 --> 02:32:00.580
So it, I guess what is the answer?

02:32:00.580 --> 02:32:02.660
And do we think the game industry is moving to that?

02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:08.340
Cause I, I feel like the game industry is relenting to that pressure because you see

02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:14.820
a willingness for games to be delayed that you didn't see before, but I don't see it

02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:15.700
from every company.

02:32:15.700 --> 02:32:18.260
And this, this is an interesting, this is the other part.

02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:26.820
This is the interesting, really weird pro about the part that everybody hates, which

02:32:26.820 --> 02:32:31.620
is all of these smaller companies are getting eaten up by, and not even small companies

02:32:31.620 --> 02:32:33.540
are getting eaten up by larger companies.

02:32:34.500 --> 02:32:40.340
Microsoft can delay Starfield because Microsoft has the budget and the bandwidth to be able

02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:40.900
to do it.

02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:44.420
A lot of studios kind of don't.

02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:50.180
It's like, if they miss the holiday, they're not going to make the money back on the game.

02:32:50.180 --> 02:32:52.660
And it's all, you know, it's all downhill from there.

02:32:53.380 --> 02:32:59.220
Although I would argue, I think the last several years have shown us, you do not need to release

02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:04.260
a game in the holiday period to set like, I think that whole like timed release thing

02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:07.940
is really a relic of the past because the same thing is true of movies.

02:33:08.580 --> 02:33:12.340
Yeah, movies do, they still make a little more in the summer and they do a little more

02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:13.300
around the holiday.

02:33:13.860 --> 02:33:19.220
That, we see movies released in February, March that make tons of money.

02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:21.700
So I, and same thing with games.

02:33:21.700 --> 02:33:22.980
Games are released all throughout the year.

02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:28.500
The Switch broke the rules by not releasing for the holidays and still sold the time.

02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:34.020
So I feel like some of the rules about when you have to release a game are changing.

02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:39.620
And if the appropriate amount of planning goes into something, then you can try to avoid

02:33:39.620 --> 02:33:40.020
crunch.

02:33:40.020 --> 02:33:47.700
I, to follow that on would lead me into a topic that I, that could double the length

02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:49.060
of the show already.

02:33:49.060 --> 02:33:57.780
I, and you're using a few keywords that I, you are correct, all except for the definitive

02:33:57.780 --> 02:33:58.740
nature of it.

02:33:58.740 --> 02:34:03.380
Releasing it at the right time of the year is not going to guarantee you a success.

02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:06.180
There is no one way to do any given thing.

02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:06.680
For sure.

02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:11.080
There are reasons why things happen predominantly.

02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:15.800
Game releases on Wednesday, movie releases on Tuesday, I think it is.

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:22.600
You know, there are kind of these societal or situational rules that you go by that might

02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:24.200
have specific lead-ins.

02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:29.400
You know, a game has to certify two months before for validation and gold masters shipping

02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:34.200
physical copies, which is less important these days, producing as many physical copies to

02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:35.000
get out to stores.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:41.080
And yes, all of that is changing for the digital distribution world, streaming of movies.

02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:46.280
The fact that movies are big titles are day one on a streaming service is you want to

02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:49.880
talk about a massive shift, a seismic shift in media.

02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:55.480
So you, you're, you're saying what is the answer?

02:34:55.480 --> 02:34:59.640
And I started this by saying that this issue is a wedge issue.

02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:04.120
And I said that very deliberately because wedge issues don't get resolved.

02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:08.920
And they're always the driving force for the, you know, are you, are you team this

02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:10.120
or are you team that?

02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:13.880
There is no the answer.

02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:17.400
People need to do what they need to do to protect themselves.

02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:19.720
I am in favor of unionization.

02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:24.040
It's an interesting topic for me to think about my own role, tiny little bit different,

02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:30.280
but the unionization initiatives I've seen in the news are a good thing.

02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:37.080
When I think about unions that I don't like, my ex's dad was an air traffic controller

02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:40.280
and also, uh, uh, uh, led his union.

02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:43.240
I don't actually remember what the correct title, uh, correct title is.

02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:49.480
Um, but like, and there's, um, not going to stray too far into it, but like police unions

02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:51.640
that protect bad policemen.

02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:56.840
Um, sports fans probably know this a little bit with, uh, angel, I don't remember his

02:35:56.840 --> 02:35:58.360
last name and the MLB.

02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:03.480
Like we can, we can point to all the issues where unionization isn't a good, and those

02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:05.720
are the exceptions in a big, good union.

02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:07.080
It's gonna happen.

02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:18.760
But I do think that more AAA billions of dollars of profit, uh, um, jobs and roles need to

02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:26.280
unionize and it will just be another point in the story of a given studio's history and

02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:26.840
what have you.

02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:32.120
Yeah, I, I, it's going to be very interesting across the next few years to see, especially

02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:36.440
now that we know that, you know, Microsoft, one of the big, you know, PAC men that are

02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:42.600
eating up all the other companies is kind of saying they're, you know, open to the union

02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:46.760
thing and, and, you know, going to honor all these agreements that are coming up as a result

02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:49.720
of, you know, a Bobby Kotick's failures at Activision.

02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:54.920
So, um, it's going to be, yeah, going to be, um, going to be interesting to see what

02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:55.880
develops the next few years.

02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:58.120
I do think that is a trend that's going to continue.

02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:02.760
I think, and we said that back when these Activision things first happened, this union

02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:04.680
thing is going to get bigger and bigger.

02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:05.960
And I, I do think it is.

02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:12.920
So I, when I, whenever I think of the future, I, I like making my predictions cause I like

02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:18.200
to have fun with it, but the guarantee of the future is that things are going to expand

02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:19.640
and things are going to retract.

02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:24.680
Activision for fuck's sake is no longer its own company.

02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:27.960
Assuming the deal goes through, Microsoft acquires them, acquires them, so on and so

02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:28.520
forth.

02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:35.720
Like to lose somebody that is tenured to, uh, uh, how many years ago is it 40?

02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:42.600
Uh, like to, to lose a 10 year of a top level player for this long is not unprecedented,

02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:44.040
but it happens.

02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:44.280
Yeah.

02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:45.640
Like what's going to happen.

02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:46.600
Things are going to change.

02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:49.320
Going to get bigger, going to get smaller, going to merge, going to split.

02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:51.960
Ma bells broke up.

02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:53.960
They they're under all there.

02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:55.320
They're all under again.

02:37:55.320 --> 02:38:01.720
It will always be a cycle because then the people that get fed up with the big corporate

02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:08.120
world, whatever it is, go start their small indie studio and end up making the next Minecraft

02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:10.920
or five fails in the process of getting to that.

02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:11.720
Oh, sorry.

02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:13.000
But then those happen.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:13.240
Yeah.

02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:14.280
Minecraft happens.

02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:15.480
Five nights of Freddy's happens.

02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:18.360
Undertale happens.

02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:19.640
Yeah.

02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:20.520
Everything.

02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:25.800
My, my favorite quote, like the quote that really instilled this in me, secret of mana,

02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:29.960
SNES time flows like a river and history repeats.

02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:32.840
I think we'll end on that note.

02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:36.280
Jason, thank you so much for the insight and thank you for the call tonight.

02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:38.600
And thanks again for a hit in 20 years with us.

02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:39.640
Appreciate it.

02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:40.920
No, another 20 years.

02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:45.960
See you next week.

02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:47.800
All right.

02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:49.740
Okay.

02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:54.520
We're going to sneak in one more call here, but I do want to try to wrap up the show by

02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:55.160
nine o'clock.

02:38:55.160 --> 02:39:00.680
So I'm going to try and I honestly need to go ahead and drop out because people are waiting

02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:01.400
for me.

02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:02.120
Oh, okay.

02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:04.040
Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:06.600
I like pie.

02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:08.280
All right.

02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:09.720
Enjoy stuff and things.

02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:11.480
Sorry about it.

02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:12.120
No, you're fine.

02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:12.520
Take care.

02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:14.200
Later taters.

02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:14.600
Bye.

02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:15.560
Bye.

02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:16.680
All right.

02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:18.280
Let me get to another call here.

02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:19.560
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:19.960
Who's this?

02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:24.920
This is why we are.

02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:25.240
Hi.

02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:27.000
Are you calling us from a cell connection?

02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:32.040
No, I'm calling you from the exact same.

02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:40.360
You're just, you're breaking up really bad for some weird reason.

02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:43.880
So I'm going to just let, I'm going to try to reconnect.

02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:45.080
Why don't you do me a favor?

02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:48.040
Reboot discord and we'll try again real quick.

02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:49.640
Cool.

02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:50.040
Cool.

02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:50.360
All right.

02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:53.160
We'll just give that a minute there.

02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:55.240
When I see him pop back in the back robot.

02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:59.960
Yeah, it sounds like it's like a slow connection or something.

02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:01.080
That's the weird thing about it.

02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:02.040
So yeah.

02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:03.480
And I'm like, why would he change?

02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:06.920
It's like 1153 at night over there.

02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:09.320
Why would he leave home anyway?

02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:09.640
All right.

02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:12.680
We'll try to bring him back on in a minute here when I see he's back in the green room.

02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:13.800
Otherwise, let me quickly check in.

02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:15.640
Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?

02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:18.120
Not a whole ton.

02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:26.600
There was some access game announcements at Anime Expo, so they announced seven different games,

02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:29.720
including inescapable, which is another.

02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:31.880
It's a game from dream loop games.

02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:38.600
I guess it's like a social survival game where you're on like a reality television show.

02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:39.800
So that's kind of interesting.

02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:41.960
Let me bring back why we are.

02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:43.240
Let me see if this works now.

02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:43.800
All right.

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:44.280
Take two.

02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:45.000
Let's try this again.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:45.160
Hi.

02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:46.040
You're on Orange House radio.

02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:49.160
Who's this next week?

02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:49.560
All right.

02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:50.120
Much better.

02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:50.360
Hi.

02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:50.840
How are you?

02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:55.560
Oh, not so bad now that I'm apparently not a robot.

02:40:55.560 --> 02:40:56.280
Yeah, that was weird.

02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:03.880
But at any rate, hi.

02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:04.600
How's it going?

02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:04.920
Hi.

02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:05.320
Good.

02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:06.200
What's on your mind tonight?

02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:10.440
Well, actually, this is dating back a few weeks.

02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:15.800
This is something that I was catching up on some older episodes of the show before the

02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:17.160
20th anniversary show.

02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:21.080
But this was obviously not something I was going to bring up last week, even if I had

02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:29.320
the time, because although it is a bit of a throwback, because I did not expect that

02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:34.680
you guys would be talking about bar versus no bar in the year 2022.

02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:39.800
That was about the last thing I expected.

02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:44.040
But yeah, lo and behold, it was a topic a few weeks back.

02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:49.960
Actually, it stemmed as a response from, I think, one of the emails that I sent in.

02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:57.640
So I just wanted to throw in my take on that, because there was a strong opinion,

02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:02.760
although that was from someone who was no longer connected, unfortunately.

02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:08.760
But and I'll preface it with everyone should enjoy the game the way that they enjoy most.

02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:14.600
And remember what I said about the culture issue of West Coast versus East Coast, which

02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:20.840
I really do think is a bigger part of that than I think we're maybe willing to give credit

02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:21.160
for.

02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:26.280
Not to toot my own horn, but I really think the arcade culture of where you learn to play

02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:28.840
the game factors huge into that.

02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:31.320
But I do want to hear your take.

02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:31.820
Go ahead.

02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:33.240
Sure.

02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:40.040
So I used to actually be one of those one X, no bar, no items, final destination kind

02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:40.920
of players.

02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:46.840
OK, you know, just sorry, just to reset the stage real quick for those in the podcast

02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:48.520
who maybe don't know what we're talking about.

02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:53.240
We're talking about a debate in the Dance Dance Revolution scene that goes back 20 years

02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:58.520
about is it OK to hold that safety bar on the back while you play the game?

02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:03.480
Or is that no, you're not dancing, you're just whack a mole with your feet.

02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:08.440
And this endless debate that's been going on here in the year of our Lord 2022.

02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:11.800
So anyway, sorry, sorry.

02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:13.320
I just want to refresh people's memory.

02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:15.320
So please, your take on the issue.

02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:19.880
Yeah, I was one of those folks that used to feel like the bar is cheating.

02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:25.320
This was, you know, back in the DDR fifth mix max days.

02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:30.200
But then I started using the bar when I started playing max 300.

02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:36.040
And, you know, the difficulty of that song was just so much higher than anything that

02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:42.920
had come before that it was, you know, it felt like it was something that kind of made

02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:49.000
it more fair, you know, because just flailing about like that without holding the bar at

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.160
that speed just seemed a little ridiculous.

02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:57.960
And then, you know, after a while, especially after In the Groove came out, but even before

02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:04.200
that, it seemed like everyone pretty much started using it for at least those high level

02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:11.400
songs, max 300, max unlimited, paranoia survivor and paranoia survivor max, the really hard

02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:13.880
stuff, the 10 footers, basically.

02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:20.280
And now the thing is Konami has their ear to the ground.

02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:21.720
They have their eyes open.

02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:29.000
When it seemed like everyone had started using the bar for the high level songs, it was not

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:33.880
a secret for very long, including to Konami themselves.

02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:40.120
So if you want my honest opinion, I think this probably happened somewhere around super

02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:41.240
Nova one or two.

02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:51.400
But somewhere along the line, they absolutely 100% definitely started factoring the bar

02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:55.320
in as something that players use.

02:44:55.320 --> 02:45:01.560
And they take that into account now when they design the highest level charts in the game,

02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:05.480
your 17s and 18s and 19s and what have you.

02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:12.440
They're assuming that if you are going to play max 360 challenge with its 1000 notes,

02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:16.840
they are assuming that you are going to be holding the bar for dear life.

02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:27.000
So I think it is now at the point, I mean, you know, the 13s and under that kind of thing,

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.440
that's its own thing.

02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:36.840
But if you choose to play a high level song like 17 and up, and you choose not to hold

02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:42.120
the bar, you are not declining a potentially unfair advantage.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:50.200
Rather, you are choosing a handicap that makes the game harder than the game designers intended,

02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:54.200
because they factored that in when they designed the chart.

02:45:55.160 --> 02:45:59.960
I just want to make sure my viewpoint on bar versus no bar is known in this situation here

02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:01.160
in the year 2022.

02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:06.840
My current viewpoint on the bar versus no bar is I don't give a fuck how you play the

02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:14.040
game, because honestly, when I look at those 16 and 17 footers, that is all ludicrous shit

02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:14.520
anyway.

02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:18.200
And I have a heart attack just reading those fucking charts.

02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:19.080
So you know what?

02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:22.280
If you need the bar bar, I don't said the part.

02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:27.080
If you need the bar to move your feet that fast, go off, sis.

02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:28.600
I don't give a fuck.

02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:33.400
I'm 44 and cannot be bothered to have an opinion about your.

02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:36.760
But just just, you know, I hope you wipe down the bar between games.

02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:38.840
That's all people.

02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:40.920
People put their babies up there to change the diaper.

02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:41.720
We've seen that.

02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:43.480
Excuse me?

02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:44.600
No, no, no.

02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:46.600
That was a keyboard mania machine back in the day.

02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:48.200
I was a keyboard mania machine back in the day.

02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:49.880
That's hilarious.

02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:53.320
You use what you have to use, I guess.

02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:59.480
Or you can go with Jason and Chad, who says, fuck DDR, play, dance, rush and groove.

02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:02.360
Yeah, that could have been my other witty answer, as I could have said.

02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:02.840
You know what?

02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:04.120
Can't we just agree?

02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:08.520
DDR is over anyway, but it's not.

02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:11.320
DDR just came out.

02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:11.800
I know.

02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:13.240
I knew that would ruffle your feathers.

02:47:14.280 --> 02:47:14.760
All right.

02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:16.760
Why are I got to wrap up so we can end the show?

02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:18.760
Quick, quick last thought here, and then we'll let you go.

02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:28.680
OK, I have completed finally after over a year working on the mini games for super duper

02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:29.480
multitasking.

02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:34.360
I've moved on to the mission mode, so please continue to look forward to that.

02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:36.520
See you next patch.

02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:39.320
See you next week.

02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:41.080
All right.

02:47:41.080 --> 02:47:42.440
Why are take care of my friend.

02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:44.120
See you later.

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:44.360
All right.

02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:44.680
Bye.

02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:45.260
Bye.

02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:49.880
Now it's going to take everything to like not do that to callers.

02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:50.760
See you next week.

02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:55.080
I have some, but I don't want to give Jason a complex either because it's iconic.

02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:56.360
We all love his outro.

02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:58.520
So all right.

02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:01.800
I think that's about it.

02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:04.200
Do you have any other last minute stories you want to squeeze in there before we sign

02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:04.700
off?

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:06.520
Yeah, as I was mentioning.

02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:10.840
So Access Games announced seven games at Anime Expo.

02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:13.160
So Inescapable is one of those.

02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:18.440
A lot of these I don't recognize because they look to be very Japanese.

02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:22.440
So Shu and No, Verce, Error, Salvation.

02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:24.280
Maybe that's Versa.

02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:25.240
I don't know how you spell that.

02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:27.880
So there's that.

02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:31.080
And then we've got Spirit Hunter Death Mark 2.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.280
Nord 9 Varkommen's and Nord 9 Last Era.

02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:40.840
Radiant Tail and Pups and Purrs Pet Shop.

02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:43.320
That's on the Switch, obviously.

02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:44.940
All right.

02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:47.160
All right.

02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:50.600
Well, we're towards the end of our show tonight.

02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:55.320

02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:06.840
need more voices out here to put on air.

02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:11.560
So thank you to everybody, whether you're chatting, called in, sending in an email or

02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:14.040

02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:15.560
Just thank you so much for being a part of it.

02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:18.680
I don't know what else to plug here at the end.

02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:21.560

Come here for a live show sometime if you can do it.

02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:29.960
Sunday nights over at VOG Network on Twitch.

02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:32.360
That's it.

02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:36.360
Let's get everybody's final thoughts and we'll sign out for the night.

02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:37.800
So, Loki, it's over to you.

02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:38.680
Your final thoughts tonight?

02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:39.960
I'm tired.

02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:43.160
All right, well, feel better.

02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:47.480
My final thought is I'm glad that I have tomorrow off.

02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:51.320
I mean, I could give a shit about the holiday this year, but I'm just glad I have another

02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:52.920
day to sleep in because I need it.

02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:53.560
I really do.

02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:58.120
For those that do remember Hoard House and Grandpa, I will just let you know Friday night

02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:01.080
we were hanging out and I was drinking with him.

02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:05.560
And you can imagine how that went trying to keep up with drinking with Grandpa.

02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:08.920
So I'm thankful to have another day to sleep in tomorrow.

02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:09.560
That's for sure.

02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:11.400
Have a good week, everybody.

02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:12.520
We'll see you next time.

02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:13.720
And hey, guess what?

02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:16.280
We get to check out that sweet new outro tonight.

02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:18.280
We'll see you next week, everybody.

02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:18.760
Good night.

02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:37.160
9 p.m.

02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:37.660
Eastern.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:43.800
The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff

02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:48.680

See you next week.
