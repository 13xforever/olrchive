00:00.000 --> 00:12.960
This week, a bunch of Nintendo emulation rumors made the rounds.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.440
This is your reminder that Nintendo has done emulation multiple times already and the slowness

00:16.440 --> 00:19.760
of rolling out games is less technical, though programming is always some part of it but

00:19.760 --> 00:21.200
more often licensing.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.840
The Nintendo Switch Online SP games are a cute addition that is most thoroughly technical

00:24.840 --> 00:28.200
and I appreciate Nintendo's effort to add a new twist into these games as well.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.960
This is just one throwback content headline.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.960
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:32.960 --> 00:35.880
this rumor and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now in the show where

00:35.880 --> 00:37.960
every gamer has a voice.

00:37.960 --> 00:41.720
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:41.720 --> 00:45.640
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.920
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:47.920 --> 00:56.200
We are live once again with episode number 911 of our show for tonight, April the 24th

00:56.200 --> 00:58.960
of 2022.

00:58.960 --> 01:03.920
And as I was as was pointed out to me on the Bobby Blackwell show before our show tonight,

01:03.920 --> 01:10.200
apparently the 10 year anniversary of VOG Network which soft launched about what April

01:10.200 --> 01:13.440
26th or so in 2012.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.440
How about that?

01:14.440 --> 01:20.040
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.400
Oh, hi.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.400
Hi Dark Sakura.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.400
How are you?

01:23.400 --> 01:24.400
I'm all right.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400
How are you?

01:25.400 --> 01:26.680
I'm doing well.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.840
Let me just take a quick minute to point out not joining us tonight.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.640
Unfortunately, Tech Master Loki, as mentioned on a previous episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:34.640 --> 01:37.240
Loki had surgery earlier this week.

01:37.240 --> 01:41.200
He's been giving updates through his Twitter account at Loki O-L-R.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.560
And I am pleased to report he is out of surgery doing fine.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.840
And I think in one of his tweets, he said it was getting better every hour.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.460
So he's just he's just at that point where he's got to let the body heal.

01:51.460 --> 01:55.740
So I would imagine instead of doing the show tonight, he's sleeping.

01:55.740 --> 01:59.260
And quite frankly, what a great thing to be doing.

01:59.260 --> 02:04.140
I think, you know, and Dark Sakura, myself perfectly healthy, but a nap sounds great,

02:04.140 --> 02:05.260
to be honest.

02:05.260 --> 02:06.260
So anyway,

02:06.260 --> 02:09.300
Honestly, many naps sound great.

02:09.300 --> 02:16.860
I we're going I start back in the office one day a week, starting tomorrow.

02:16.860 --> 02:23.700
And the whole thought is just filling me with like bits and pieces of dread.

02:23.700 --> 02:31.100
Because the moment if I if I get sick, I'm taking it to HR.

02:31.100 --> 02:35.820
Is everybody going back the same day or are they staggering it?

02:35.820 --> 02:42.100
I think you get to pick your one day a week out of like, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.620
Okay, so there's a chance not everybody will be there the same day.

02:45.620 --> 02:49.540
So it's a little bit Yeah, but still, now.

02:49.540 --> 02:56.140
Now that you know, really, vaccinated or boosted status really isn't doing a whole lot to,

02:56.140 --> 02:59.540
to starve off who gets sick, just the severity of it.

02:59.540 --> 03:04.020
Um, I've got concerns then again, I came back from Disneyland just fine.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.980
I was gonna say let's talk about the happy stuff.

03:05.980 --> 03:07.460
You weren't here last week.

03:07.460 --> 03:08.940
No, no surgery.

03:08.940 --> 03:11.460
It was a birthday thing that you were doing last week.

03:11.460 --> 03:12.460
Yeah, it was my birthday.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.420
My birthday is very important holiday.

03:14.420 --> 03:17.660
But you you went to Disneyland.

03:17.660 --> 03:18.660
I did.

03:18.660 --> 03:28.340
I am I had a very, very good time, although my body certainly reminded me that it it's

03:28.340 --> 03:37.640
it's not a teenager, even though I tried to run around like I was so, so it actually my

03:37.640 --> 03:43.780
whole thing started before then because Sunday I wasn't I wasn't here.

03:43.820 --> 03:51.700
So what I ended up doing is I drove down on Sunday kind of rushed my way down and stayed

03:51.700 --> 04:00.860
with Marissa, and Chris is our lovely friend, Marissa, who has been on the show a few times

04:00.860 --> 04:08.180
and been in chat does some voice acting stuff, which is Yeah, I haven't seen Marissa in years.

04:08.180 --> 04:11.660
So it was a really pleasant visit.

04:11.660 --> 04:14.300
So you had a good time.

04:14.300 --> 04:20.420
And then, and the area that that the two of them live in is actually really pretty.

04:20.420 --> 04:25.460
I'd never been to the Moorpark before.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.960
And it's sort of up in the hills.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.300
And it was a little bit harrowing of a drive because my maps took me kind of a backwards

04:31.300 --> 04:32.300
way.

04:32.300 --> 04:36.500
But I'm glad it did because it was really pretty.

04:36.780 --> 04:44.740
And then the next day, I went to pick up Tiara, which cements how much I hate LAX.

04:44.740 --> 04:55.300
And so I managed to get Tiara out of the clutches of the the worldway traffic.

04:55.300 --> 05:01.540
And we went to Anaheim and had sort of a late lunch at this place called Requiem, which

05:01.540 --> 05:05.140
is a Final Fantasy themed coffee bar.

05:05.140 --> 05:06.900
I had no idea there was a place like that.

05:06.900 --> 05:07.900
That's cool.

05:07.900 --> 05:08.900
It's beautiful.

05:08.900 --> 05:09.900
Oh, awesome.

05:09.900 --> 05:13.900
It's not far from the park, you know, so it's near where our hotel was, even though I got

05:13.900 --> 05:16.820
bad directions because I put in the wrong days in.

05:16.820 --> 05:18.460
There's like 50 million days in.

05:18.460 --> 05:19.460
Oh, yeah.

05:19.460 --> 05:25.220
They're all days in by the park, need to specify which ones which.

05:25.220 --> 05:29.100
So so we spent a really decent amount of time there.

05:29.100 --> 05:33.820
It was really, really, you know, and they serve you like these little toasties.

05:33.820 --> 05:42.500
I had a Caprice one, which was, you know, basil and mozzarella and tomato, and it had

05:42.500 --> 05:46.060
this like really good balsamic glaze on it.

05:46.060 --> 05:52.420
And I laughed because Tiara had edamame toast, and I was calling it Japanese beans on toast

05:52.420 --> 06:00.700
because edamame beans, you know, and and then we went to the hotel.

06:00.700 --> 06:04.780
We had like dinner at Shakey's, which I've never been to Shakey's Dan thinks that I didn't

06:04.780 --> 06:06.760
even know they still existed.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.820
That's what blew my because you texted me that right next door to our hotel.

06:09.820 --> 06:13.500
Yeah, you texted me that you were a tiara at Shakey's and I was like, they're still

06:13.500 --> 06:14.500
around.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.020
Like they all the Did you know the original I mean, you probably didn't but I'm gonna

06:17.020 --> 06:18.020
share it anyway.

06:18.020 --> 06:20.540
The original Shakey's pizza was in Sacramento.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.620
The very first Shakey's pizza was Sacramento.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.660
It's now the mimosa house down on 65th.

06:24.660 --> 06:26.380
That was the original Shakey's.

06:26.380 --> 06:29.940
So I and I remember Dan telling me about it before.

06:29.940 --> 06:34.620
Yeah, and it's it's it's wild that like they're still open because they are they're all gone

06:34.620 --> 06:35.620
here.

06:35.620 --> 06:36.620
I haven't seen one in years.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.660
But yeah, the the big wooden doors.

06:38.660 --> 06:39.660
Yeah.

06:39.660 --> 06:43.660
And the arcade they always had a really big arcade area like most roundtables games there.

06:43.660 --> 06:44.660
Yeah.

06:44.660 --> 06:51.540
I really wanted to play like like a deer hunting and some Oh, like, well, it's a Walmart arcade

06:51.540 --> 06:52.540
at this point.

06:52.540 --> 06:53.540
Gross.

06:53.540 --> 06:54.540
Kind of.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.860
Um, but they put way too much basil on my pizza.

06:57.860 --> 07:01.300
I was like, I love basil and this is excessive.

07:01.300 --> 07:11.740
So and so the next day we went in for opening and our mutual friend Nick was came to meet

07:11.740 --> 07:18.460
us and I he actually ran into traffic so it was a little bit late but then he hung out

07:18.460 --> 07:25.820
for a decent time traffic in LA what no no Nick straight next streamer here on Twitch

07:25.820 --> 07:33.380
you and I have both rated him a million times yeah so really just just a cool guy all together

07:33.380 --> 07:40.580
really sweet really fun to hang out with and then after after a little bit he rode a California

07:40.580 --> 07:45.840
screaming with us or not screaming it's a credit coaster yeah credit coaster yeah and

07:45.840 --> 07:50.860
and we we we just had a really good time and then he had to go off and it was me and tiara

07:50.860 --> 07:58.060
for a while and we had dinner at Carthay circle I got a really delicious drink it's

07:58.060 --> 08:04.380
like branding creme de cacao and coffee and cream but it like it kind of got my stomach

08:04.380 --> 08:09.540
funny and I had Moroccan meatballs which I should have realized that there was going

08:09.540 --> 08:13.580
to be something spicy in it so I ended up like having a slight allergic reaction but

08:13.580 --> 08:18.980
it wasn't bad but I mean I got to pilot the Millennium Falcon I wish I had been right

08:18.980 --> 08:24.620
pilot next time I want to be a gunner the gunners look like they had a lot more fun

08:24.620 --> 08:27.180
is the gunner the one that just pushes the button the whole time because I think that's

08:27.180 --> 08:31.020
what I did that's the engineer okay that's why I just yeah I just kept pushing a button

08:31.020 --> 08:35.020
in the back row you're an engineer I thought I was in the middle but I it was a while ago

08:35.020 --> 08:39.940
then you're a gunner okay I don't remember it was a while ago the pilots had a decent

08:39.940 --> 08:44.380
amount of stuff to do but I I wanted to do the hyperdrive so I'm gonna wait and do that

08:44.380 --> 08:51.900
next time it was really really cool I I had a good time with that one I really enjoyed

08:51.900 --> 08:59.260
it the sense of motion was fairly realistic too and we did you know we did Haunted Mansion

08:59.260 --> 09:05.820
we did Indy we did Jungle Cruise we had a really really good tour guide who I'm fairly

09:05.820 --> 09:12.860
certain was non-binary and had some really funny Mean Girls oriented jokes fun did you

09:12.860 --> 09:18.380
get to do Rise of the Resistance or too crazy I didn't do Rise of the Resistance it had

09:18.380 --> 09:22.620
I didn't put in for the thing and honestly I was like it's a hassle the only thing I

09:22.620 --> 09:29.300
really wanted to do was with Smugglers Run okay I had blue milk I will go on record right

09:29.300 --> 09:36.500
now saying that if your throat is sore drink the blue milk it is somewhat coating and very

09:36.500 --> 09:40.720
relaxing but the other good news it's been a week now since you've been back and no symptoms

09:40.720 --> 09:48.440
of the big C so and I did a rapid test oh good good and so my rapid test was negative I also

09:48.440 --> 09:55.120
though on the way out after I took Tiara to LAX I had lunch with Nick again and I was supposed to

09:55.120 --> 10:03.160
meet Isaac oh but work got in the way of that so it was just me and Nick and we went to really good

10:03.160 --> 10:12.400
yakiniku place hmm it's like the Japanese version of Korean barbecue yummy so um really good and

10:12.400 --> 10:18.640
then I had I stopped at the grapevine after the grapevine to get myself a massage and one of those

10:18.640 --> 10:24.400
like beat-you-up massage chairs because they're great and then I was checking the time for the

10:24.400 --> 10:32.320
Bravo cheese farm which is my other resort that I go to 99 or 5 version 99 okay because I always

10:32.320 --> 10:36.480
take 99 back that's the one for me is the one I go to that has the llama that gives no fucks

10:36.480 --> 10:41.400
because you know they built one like at the exact same place on i-5 yeah it's funny it's yeah two

10:41.400 --> 10:47.380
of them I know but I have to go to the one on 99 that's the one hmm and so I thought oh no they

10:47.380 --> 10:57.640
close at seven so I booked it I like was doing a hundred in my Fiat TV I made it on 99 like I

10:57.640 --> 11:03.720
there's a part so so for those not from the area there's two major freeways 99 with me you know I

11:03.720 --> 11:08.320
know but I was to say for those not from from the California there's two major freeways that connect

11:08.320 --> 11:14.400
like Sacramento NorCal and LA you can take 99 or the five it's it's and five is usually like

11:14.400 --> 11:21.240
trucker route cows nothing there 99 goes through all the towns like Stockton Modesto Fresno Bakersfield

11:21.240 --> 11:27.280
like all the towns in the valley you're going through on 99 so there's more to do on 99 but

11:27.320 --> 11:31.280
five is the one where you can drive a little faster because there's like no but less people

11:31.280 --> 11:36.440
on it but truckers and you know cows inside of the road now more cops on five now it doesn't

11:36.440 --> 11:40.360
totally surprise me people people do drive crazy on five like not just me they were doing some

11:40.360 --> 11:48.720
construction though on 99 but I was I was pretty I mean I drive a Fiat so when the lanes went narrow

11:48.720 --> 11:55.680
I could still maintain speed and it was it wasn't that bad but when I got there they're like oh no

11:55.680 --> 12:01.680
we're open till eight we changed it we just didn't do it on our website and I'm like fuck's sake so I

12:01.680 --> 12:07.680
hung around and they have more animals there but that that alpaca still gives no fucks he was just

12:07.680 --> 12:13.840
like I'm just gonna sit here whatever I'm bored I made friends with a goat and then I watched the

12:13.840 --> 12:19.200
funniest thing I actually have this little video of it where there's a bunny hutch now oh by the

12:19.200 --> 12:24.360
way I played with Marissa's bunny Snoopy who I I'm in love with that rabbit I'm gonna go back and

12:24.400 --> 12:29.120
steal him but the bunnies in the hutch like I caught two of them they look like they were

12:29.120 --> 12:32.920
just cuddling so they like a little video of the bunnies cuddling and then the other bunnies okay

12:32.920 --> 12:39.240
it's time to fuck and the girl bunnies like fuck you I'm not into this and she like bounces off and

12:39.240 --> 12:43.320
the bunnies following or trying to mount again over and over and finally she just like turns

12:43.320 --> 12:49.080
around at him and then she bounces off and he finally gets the idea but I'm like you tell him

12:49.320 --> 12:55.040
you tell him little girl bunny tell him you are not down you tell him to take no for an answer

12:55.040 --> 13:00.360
lady bunny all right not being lady bunny I didn't mean that in lady bunny way she didn't

13:00.360 --> 13:05.200
have on nearly enough wigs let me let me go to the chat believe it or not it's a video game podcast

13:05.200 --> 13:10.120
we'll get into that too but I do want to go to the chat over at twitch.tv slash of hog network

13:10.120 --> 13:14.440
where we do tape live every Sunday night nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after

13:14.440 --> 13:18.600
the Bobby Blackwell show and Mike Deft is asking the five covers the whole state doesn't it

13:19.160 --> 13:26.840
yeah it ends in TJ it like the San Diego and Mexico border that's where five starts in the

13:26.840 --> 13:31.160
south and it goes all the way it goes through Portland through Seattle all the way and ends

13:31.800 --> 13:36.680
in Canada at that that town I can't remember the name of the town way up there in North

13:36.680 --> 13:42.120
Washington but basically Vancouver because they change the freeway changes names you get into

13:42.120 --> 13:46.280
Canada but basically it takes you to Vancouver Bellevue no Bellevues before now it's another

13:46.280 --> 13:51.560
B name but I can't remember the name off top my head but way up way up it's not far north of

13:51.560 --> 13:55.160
Seattle it's only like as I think the Canadian border is only like an hour or two north of

13:55.160 --> 14:01.560
Seattle if that so yeah but anyway yeah five five is preferred I still prefer 99 it goes three lanes

14:01.560 --> 14:05.640
more often you've got more truck stops you know yeah there's more to do there's more to see

14:06.600 --> 14:14.120
exactly and for me given that I'm still having that issue with you know my alertness

14:14.120 --> 14:20.440
for me being able to stop like that it was a good idea sorry I have cat drama going on behind me

14:20.440 --> 14:25.480
like smoosh always arguing yeah smoosh just chased cheddar in here I'm trying to see

14:26.920 --> 14:30.120
I can't even see where cheddar ended up he must have went behind the couch they ran in here so

14:30.120 --> 14:36.360
fast don't worry I'm sure folks in chat are dying to see the cats if I if I catch one of them I'll

14:36.360 --> 14:40.520
show them on stream don't worry so but yeah they're still they're still getting used to

14:41.080 --> 14:45.400
they're still getting used to each other so is cheddar coming out of his uh little shell a bit

14:45.400 --> 14:50.680
more he is oh he's at my feet he's he's getting better he's less shy than he was but like smoosh

14:50.680 --> 14:55.320
will pick on him like smoosh is starting to be an aggressor smoosh will like follow him around and

14:55.320 --> 14:59.960
then like do this thing where he goes and like snort like right at him like he's and then cheddar

14:59.960 --> 15:05.240
just books it and smoosh will follow him like that's their way of like playing lately now

15:05.240 --> 15:11.960
cheddar's like at my feet and refuses to move super adorable so anyway you hear any meowing

15:11.960 --> 15:19.160
that's what's going on is they're basically taunting each other so all right wait cheddar

15:19.160 --> 15:25.720
cheddar hold on buy me time dark sagra okay um I have five dollars and that will buy you two

15:25.720 --> 15:34.040
seconds of time haha um I don't know if smoosh is trying to be dominant though it just doesn't seem

15:34.040 --> 15:39.480
cheddar didn't like that oh yeah well cheddar is a very shy boy yeah he is

15:41.160 --> 15:47.000
so he let me he let me uh boop his nose he's super adorable like whenever I'm napping or

15:47.000 --> 15:53.720
I'm asleep cheddar will run in and like wants to like lie on top of me and purrs really loud he's

15:53.720 --> 16:00.040
just I think he's very very happy to be um indoors because we were it's interesting so I started

16:00.040 --> 16:06.120
cheddar and instagram and just through the whole process the people that found cheddar actually

16:06.120 --> 16:11.000
follow him on instagram because the adoption agency like you know we were we were fine with

16:11.000 --> 16:14.840
the link being given out or whatever so they they put him in touch and so we got to see because I

16:14.840 --> 16:20.280
I looked at one of the instagram and I got I could see um that uh I could see a picture of cheddar

16:20.280 --> 16:25.240
when he was found and they really cleaned him up like he he was not in good shape when he was found

16:25.240 --> 16:29.560
so but he's so adorable now you have to send me that link later yeah I will for sure

16:30.040 --> 16:38.040
so uh pod culture and chat says so is one more each dad's kitty it does seem right now anyway

16:38.040 --> 16:42.680
that smoosh follows alan around a little more and cheddar follows me around a little more but

16:42.680 --> 16:47.640
I don't like I also really don't want to play favorites like I love them both um it's just you

16:47.640 --> 16:54.040
know whatever it's what it is so yeah all right uh let's get into some video game news I mean we

16:54.040 --> 16:59.320
could have a cat podcast tonight I suppose you know considering that Pax East was this weekend

16:59.320 --> 17:03.720
I feel like the news is still a little bit light all things considered so you know what we probably

17:03.720 --> 17:08.920
could fill up three hours about cats but we will get into the news and we're going to start tonight

17:08.920 --> 17:13.560
talking about Nintendo and you know uh workers rights in the video game industry is something

17:13.560 --> 17:18.440
that's really been a theme on our show for the past couple years honestly and everything really

17:18.440 --> 17:22.760
came to a climax when we were talking about Activision Blizzard and still everything that's

17:22.760 --> 17:28.520
going on there I know you have an update on that later in the show um but this week the eye of

17:28.520 --> 17:33.800
workers rights in the industry has turned to Nintendo um there's a lot of game blogs are

17:33.800 --> 17:39.400
are talking about a Nintendo staffer who says that their right to unionize was violated and this is

17:39.400 --> 17:46.680
per a complaint that was filed with the national labor relations board um this also it should should

17:46.680 --> 17:52.760
be very important to point out this is a lot to do with contractors rights as well because

17:52.760 --> 17:59.000
contractors are really used a lot in the gaming industry I think more than is talked about quite

17:59.000 --> 18:06.280
honestly um contractors sometimes known as like temp agencies is another you know big thing

18:06.280 --> 18:12.520
contractors are a way to find labor very fast because a lot of your contractors have already

18:12.520 --> 18:17.640
done things like screening interviewing and so forth so they know that somebody's like ready to

18:17.640 --> 18:24.360
go um and you it's it's a good way a lot of times for companies to find uh folks to hire long term

18:24.360 --> 18:30.840
as well I got my job that I was at for 14 years through through a contractor temp temp agency

18:32.040 --> 18:37.240
yeah I'm heading on nine years so it's it you know for first but of course dark soccer and I

18:37.240 --> 18:44.760
also don't work in the games industry so it's uh you know um but this uh uh contracting company

18:44.760 --> 18:51.640
that Nintendo uses um Aston Carter which is a global hiring firm uh the uh worker is uh

18:51.640 --> 18:57.800
basically claiming the both of them violated their legal legally protected right to unionize and this

18:57.800 --> 19:02.680
was a complaint that was made with the national labor relations board on Friday what happens is

19:02.680 --> 19:07.800
that this contractor alleges that Nintendo of America and Aston Carter said they did concerted

19:07.800 --> 19:14.600
activities and quote coercive actions to interfere with their right to organize um now the

19:14.600 --> 19:19.960
filing only has broad charges so we don't know like who was involved what was involved we don't

19:19.960 --> 19:26.200
know any of the specifics but per report from Axios quote the allegations were likely to include

19:26.200 --> 19:33.320
claims of surveillance threats retaliation and either a layoff or refusal to hire um that's also

19:33.320 --> 19:40.600
mentioned in a similar article from protocol um there will be an investigation but a lot of folks

19:40.600 --> 19:45.080
saying you know what probably not nothing's going to happen uh a University of California Berkeley

19:45.080 --> 19:51.240
professor and labor expert Harley Shaken said in an interview if the NLRB is listing these

19:51.240 --> 19:57.880
allegations it's pretty serious and their ability to act is very real after these allegations came

19:57.880 --> 20:04.680
out a twitter user known as the boy came out and said they worked at Nintendo and said working for

20:04.680 --> 20:09.880
Nintendo contract for three years was one of the most stressful and awful experiences of my life

20:09.880 --> 20:14.280
co-workers were great but i was constantly under pressure of being let go for little things like

20:14.280 --> 20:19.240
going to the bathroom or being stuck in traffic an extra two minutes before work additionally they

20:19.240 --> 20:24.120
have an awful practice of dangling the carrot a full-time employee to contract so they almost

20:24.120 --> 20:29.800
universally never hire on just to keep exploiting them and keep them quiet i spoke up to try and

20:29.800 --> 20:36.760
better things for co-workers main reason i was let go tbh um again a lot of this to me speaks

20:36.760 --> 20:42.600
to contractors rights i mean there's a few things going on with this story right number one we've

20:42.600 --> 20:47.240
said from the very beginning since these Activision Blizzard reports came out and even before that

20:47.240 --> 20:52.920
this is an industry problem right so if you thought Nintendo was immune from this type of

20:52.920 --> 21:00.920
stuff i mean surprise now i get Nintendo of America i guess we could be thankful for a moment

21:00.920 --> 21:05.960
at least we're not hearing anything about sexism or you know some of those more serious things

21:05.960 --> 21:11.240
we've heard coming out of the activisions and like you know uh that that whole he was gonna

21:11.240 --> 21:14.760
kill his secretary or something allegedly i'm sorry i'm totally butchering the quotes but there

21:14.760 --> 21:19.960
was some really messed up stuff that came out of the activision stuff right you know i i feel

21:19.960 --> 21:25.800
awkward sitting here going at least it's just contractors rights but i don't i don't want to

21:25.800 --> 21:31.560
diminish the situation either i mean this whole thing about they could get fired for the littlest

21:31.560 --> 21:38.440
thing this is why a lot of companies and not just the tech industry quite frankly go to contractor

21:38.440 --> 21:46.600
agencies because yeah it is really easy to let somebody go sometimes i think the contractor

21:46.600 --> 21:51.800
agencies are predatory practice i see but it's it's weird because i also feel like it's biting

21:51.800 --> 21:55.640
the hands that feed me a little bit because sometimes it's worked out my favor in the past

21:55.640 --> 22:00.840
you know as far as like getting in with a big company um it just felt though for some of us

22:01.960 --> 22:09.320
i would expect the majority don't work out yeah no and i i'm i'm all for like this whole

22:09.320 --> 22:15.800
practice of how this works getting scrutinized and getting looked at and contractors rights

22:15.800 --> 22:21.800
being taken seriously please don't misunderstand me with what i'm saying um but i just say this

22:22.040 --> 22:27.320
a lot of these things that are being talked about i don't think are unique to tech either i think

22:27.320 --> 22:35.800
this is a lot with contractors and you know just in general how that all works so uh going to the

22:35.800 --> 22:41.160
chat because you know our chat is going to light up at this uh over at twitch.tv slash vog network

22:41.160 --> 22:45.800
deejirama says i kind of think that this person is mad that nintendo wouldn't flip their contract

22:45.800 --> 22:53.880
over to fte maybe so i mean but you know we talked about like the dangling carrot and all

22:53.880 --> 22:59.480
of that stuff maybe there is a frustration there you give and give and give and you expect that you

22:59.480 --> 23:03.400
know maybe you're going to move up the ladder maybe get some of the benefits you know and

23:03.400 --> 23:07.480
stuff that comes with being a full-time employee maybe it does get frustrating when time and again

23:07.480 --> 23:15.000
that doesn't happen for whatever so uh fanara in chat says contractors equals first one out the

23:15.000 --> 23:22.280
door yes as well like if there's ever a layoff or something like that almost always yeah contractors

23:22.280 --> 23:30.440
like unless they're highly specialized almost always yeah um deejirama s also says well even

23:30.440 --> 23:34.360
as a contractor you have to still follow the handbook of the company but they really can't

23:34.360 --> 23:41.480
fire you over silly stuff um quest bus they can reach out to the the contracting company and say

23:41.480 --> 23:47.400
that you're not a good fit i i have seen it and i i'll speak openly about this because it's not

23:47.400 --> 23:52.200
my current company and it's not you know anything where any of us are affiliated with currently but

23:52.200 --> 23:58.280
i've absolutely seen it where a person didn't show up to work for two days in a row and somebody

23:58.280 --> 24:01.640
would call the contract agency and say could you just let them know we don't need them back

24:01.640 --> 24:06.600
and send somebody else and it didn't even it didn't even really matter what the reason is

24:06.760 --> 24:12.280
just they they we needed them they weren't here let's do somebody else and that's what you know

24:12.280 --> 24:17.960
happens with contractors um and they can totally do it as retaliation i i was working with a

24:17.960 --> 24:24.520
mortgage company once that they were violating several federal laws and i called them on it

24:25.480 --> 24:29.880
and i told them why and i showed them the laws and like when i do this work i'm going to be

24:29.880 --> 24:34.840
documenting every piece of it i'm not going to have anything that i do come back and bite me

24:35.480 --> 24:39.400
and they let me go and yeah and then i filed it and then i filed a complaint and the company

24:39.400 --> 24:44.520
was gone a year later yeah and you know you know she just doesn't fit in with the culture here

24:46.440 --> 24:48.360
yeah i'm not gonna break the law for you

24:50.440 --> 24:55.080
anyway well they didn't last the the year because i'm not the only one that filed the complaint too

24:55.080 --> 25:03.720
yeah so anyway um just that's you know uh what's going on at uh nintendo uh is under oops sorry um

25:05.400 --> 25:09.240
i'm having problems with my computer over here where did discord go okay there we go

25:09.240 --> 25:15.800
okay um but uh another thing i wanted to say about this whole nintendo uh news is that nintendo did

25:15.800 --> 25:23.080
comment on the situation um so nintendo said we are aware of the claim which was filed with the

25:23.080 --> 25:28.600
national labor relations board by a contractor who has previously terminated for the disclosure

25:28.600 --> 25:35.720
of confidential information and for no other reason but that see i kind of like i get what

25:35.720 --> 25:42.440
nintendo's doing here and covering their butt but i kind of think that reason like they were watching

25:42.440 --> 25:47.640
him and he said something to somebody and they just they jumped on it you know what i mean like

25:47.640 --> 25:51.880
i i don't know this seems a little bit of a stretch to me but whatever i'm not i'm not there

25:51.880 --> 25:57.720
i don't know the specifics whatever uh nintendo is not aware of any attempts to unionize or related

25:57.720 --> 26:02.280
activity and intends to cooperate with the investigation conducted by the nlrb

26:02.280 --> 26:06.040
nintendo is fully committed to providing a welcoming and supportive work environment for

26:06.040 --> 26:11.800
all our employees and contractors we take matters of employment very seriously well then i would be

26:11.800 --> 26:17.640
curious what they have to say about the twitter user i talked about as well and other former

26:17.640 --> 26:24.120
employees whether they be full-time or contractor i've heard other stuff as well that wasn't posted

26:24.120 --> 26:31.400
as publicly um that's rather interesting so uh you know it was really just a matter of time

26:31.400 --> 26:37.080
before your fav in the industry had a good good look at it as well and so here's now you know

26:37.080 --> 26:43.320
nintendo's turn to look at what are they doing right what are they doing wrong so interesting

26:43.960 --> 26:48.840
anyhow let's move on and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week

26:48.840 --> 26:53.480
in how was your gaming week dark soccer i know you were at disneyland but did you

26:53.480 --> 27:01.240
fit in any uh video gaming in your week um yeah i mean i i streamed so i played dead by daylight

27:01.240 --> 27:08.120
and i played second and said to three um i have four of the mana beasts down or whatever they're

27:08.120 --> 27:15.320
calling them the the nevadons i think is what they're calling them i i just think of them as

27:15.320 --> 27:21.800
the mana beast um so um halfway through them and then i think after that after the other four then

27:21.800 --> 27:29.480
i have the last fight so and then i've beaten the game and i'm moving on to tear enigma probably

27:29.480 --> 27:37.720
whoa yeah um and dead by daylight i'm kind of i don't know i just like i didn't have any

27:37.720 --> 27:42.120
concentration yesterday so i was just sort of being you know whatever about the game

27:42.120 --> 27:48.040
it's just sort of like i don't care all right they won yeah whatever okay good sure yeah you

27:48.040 --> 27:55.400
can boop my demo dog i'm still going to tear you to pieces i actually played demo it was kind of

27:55.400 --> 28:00.840
fun he's a cute puppy i i didn't i haven't touched it by daylight all week i don't know what it is

28:00.840 --> 28:04.360
i'm not like consciously trying to avoid it or anything i just kind of feel like the game's in

28:04.360 --> 28:11.080
a bit of a lull for me right now i still play regularly for consistency it's also like double

28:11.080 --> 28:19.320
experience yeah i heard that was going on this weekend the eerie shards yeah but um um i'm still

28:19.320 --> 28:24.360
i still have fun i get frustrated sometimes and yeah like fanara just said new rift comes out on

28:24.360 --> 28:30.520
the 27th oh that's right it's a twins rift yeah twins and david maybe i'll log in for that yeah

28:31.640 --> 28:36.760
yeah so i have to see if there's anything you know worthwhile in it that i want that would

28:36.760 --> 28:42.040
make it worth paying for so i mean i like i who am i kidding i like all the cosmetics so

28:42.040 --> 28:46.040
i already have enough of a what is the orange shards i forget what they're called the oric

28:46.040 --> 28:50.120
cells that's it i have enough of those on my account to buy the rift i probably will whatever

28:50.120 --> 28:56.760
who cares i've actually i once paid for a whole rift as in like paid to advance on it oh wow

28:56.760 --> 29:02.680
okay and that was for all the pig stuff uh okay got it because i'm sorry i'm the pig mane

29:02.680 --> 29:11.000
um but no other other than that uh those are you know that my my wordscapes i'm still kind

29:11.000 --> 29:21.000
of addicted um didn't really do much else um yeah right just i didn't even play astro blasters

29:22.520 --> 29:28.520
um my gaming week uh honestly not a lot of new stuff it's it's two of my standbys i played a

29:28.520 --> 29:33.960
lot of both i played more no man's sky i actually was really good with my streaming this week i

29:33.960 --> 29:38.360
you know ever since the move and my life getting you know the raid turned upside down yeah you're

29:38.360 --> 29:43.320
welcome um it's since all that kind of turned things upside down um i've been getting back

29:43.320 --> 29:48.120
into streaming more regularly so i stream monday tuesday wednesday and one other day whatever day

29:48.120 --> 29:54.120
i rated you friday maybe so um yeah i've been streaming more it's weird um but i played no man

29:54.120 --> 29:59.320
sky on monday and i think friday stream the night i rated you i think i was playing that too

29:59.320 --> 30:05.880
um and uh yeah no man's sky i i beat expedition six so i cleared everything with that expedition

30:05.880 --> 30:10.840
and as annoying as it was with the increased pirate raids i think it made me a better no man's

30:10.840 --> 30:16.040
sky player for one it forced me to do an element of the game i don't normally you know pay attention

30:16.040 --> 30:20.840
to which is the combat stuff i would actually say it's probably the easiest expedition well

30:21.160 --> 30:26.440
the normandy one was probably the easiest and that was more because of the length it was designed to

30:26.440 --> 30:32.120
only be like a two-week expedition so you had to beat it in like five hours of game time um so that

30:32.120 --> 30:36.280
was probably the easiest one but i would say six was probably the second easiest one uh if you're

30:36.280 --> 30:40.760
willing to do the combat fights now i know bobby's talked about this on his show he really does not

30:40.760 --> 30:46.280
like to do the fighting he's more of a pacifist player and i get it like if you don't like to do

30:47.080 --> 30:51.480
the combat this latest patch is kind of annoying because they added

30:51.480 --> 30:57.480
more opportunities to get fights picked with you but another thing i learned is that you can pretty

30:57.480 --> 31:02.280
much run away from anything as long as you don't engage if you keep running one direction long

31:02.280 --> 31:06.840
enough or flying long enough in one direction you can get out of it without engaging it's just

31:06.840 --> 31:12.440
annoying because you know like a lot of things no man's sky you're doing one thing and then squirrel

31:12.440 --> 31:17.400
something else comes up uh that's just how the game goes but i enjoyed my experience in the

31:17.400 --> 31:22.600
expedition so much that like friday i was just like you know what i want to continue in this

31:22.600 --> 31:29.640
new game that i started because um i beat the beat the expedition like an hour into monday's stream

31:29.640 --> 31:33.400
and it was the last day for twitch drops and twitch drops take about three hours so i was like

31:33.400 --> 31:37.400
you know i'm gonna try to do a three hour stream let's just start a new game let's do a new game

31:37.400 --> 31:41.640
with all these rewards i've been collecting through twitch drops and everything so i started

31:41.640 --> 31:46.280
the game and then i kind of found like i was missing it i kind of want to play that game again

31:46.280 --> 31:52.440
um so i did on friday and um advanced my game and i probably will stream that a couple more

31:52.440 --> 32:00.120
days this week so i just i like no man's sky is just a relaxing game and the nice thing about

32:00.120 --> 32:03.880
streaming it is that you know enough especially with the twitch drops a lot more people were

32:03.880 --> 32:07.880
coming into chat but even on friday when there were no drops you know some some of the peeps

32:07.880 --> 32:13.000
that i've known for a long time thanks to olr and hanging in other communities just coming in just

32:13.000 --> 32:18.120
chilling out hey what's up you know this game is still pretty but just talking about stuff while

32:18.120 --> 32:26.440
i'm blasting rocks for dust so um yeah quest buster says i just found out that you can make

32:26.440 --> 32:31.880
squadrons and have a wingman warp in when you get into a fight they're not that great but they give

32:31.880 --> 32:37.240
the pirate something else to shoot at yes you don't really learn about that until the very end

32:37.240 --> 32:44.280
of expedition six but as soon as you get your freighter which in the main story or any time

32:44.280 --> 32:49.720
really it's in the game's code if you do five warps galaxy warps your fifth galaxy warp you

32:49.720 --> 32:55.880
will always warp into a freighter fight if you kill the pirates which isn't that hard you the

32:55.880 --> 32:59.960
freighter will invite you aboard and the captain will be like i'm sick of this why don't you take

32:59.960 --> 33:05.240
my freighter and you can get the freighter the minute you get that you can unlock at one of the

33:05.240 --> 33:11.400
panels squadron mates and they cost nanites like most things in the game does um but they're it's

33:11.400 --> 33:16.360
pretty easy to recruit at least one and uh yeah they'll fight by your side in some of those battles

33:16.360 --> 33:22.120
which is uh pretty nice so something to think about um anyway also i've been playing follow

33:22.120 --> 33:28.840
fantasy 14 because i was sidetracked by no man's sky with the expedition that was timed over easter

33:28.840 --> 33:36.120
weekend i um was neglecting the 6.1 patch in follow fantasy 14 which i finally caught up with this

33:36.120 --> 33:40.840
week so i streamed on tuesday and wednesday night shane joined me we did some dungeons i've done

33:40.840 --> 33:45.400
the new dungeon i did the new raid i didn't do that on stream i ended up doing that um like

33:45.400 --> 33:51.720
yesterday saturday or something i don't remember uh so yeah so uh been enjoying the patch in 6.1

33:51.720 --> 33:56.760
final fantasy i'm playing sage for the first time which is one of the new classes that came out with

33:56.760 --> 34:03.000
endwalker and it's funny because i i played it for the very first time on stream on wednesday

34:03.000 --> 34:08.200
and i think you hear me sitting there kind of going none of these words make sense none of this

34:08.200 --> 34:13.880
thing makes sense none of but now that i've played it and i'm up to like level 76 now um i actually

34:13.880 --> 34:19.000
really enjoy the rhythm of sage it's a very like fast pace there's always something going on type

34:19.000 --> 34:25.000
of healer where you're doing damage and healing and barriering and so it's very like satisfying

34:25.000 --> 34:29.080
when you do it well but it can be tricky to get the hang of it first but i'm enjoying my adventure

34:29.080 --> 34:33.080
in sage right now in final fantasy and i'll probably take it to 90 honestly so that'll

34:33.080 --> 34:40.120
probably be the next class i get to the end game i still have yet to look at the pvp in final fantasy

34:40.120 --> 34:45.240
but that's kind of on like my list of things to do hopefully in this next week so that's pretty much

34:45.240 --> 34:50.600
my gaming week uh mike deft in our chat talks about most of my gaming this week has been pokemon

34:50.600 --> 34:55.640
either go or unite which some kirby thrown in there and that does remind me you know i don't

34:55.640 --> 35:01.400
talk about the um gps games but i should because they do take a lot of my attention yesterday was

35:01.400 --> 35:07.560
like niantic community day where they were doing stuff in all three games so pokemon go had the

35:07.560 --> 35:14.200
stuff old debut and all that stuff in the shinies um and pikmin had a you know their community day

35:14.200 --> 35:21.080
for tulips so i walked 17 000 steps yesterday because in the morning i was walking with my

35:21.080 --> 35:26.520
pic my ingress friends although there was a thing going on in ingress but it was kind of like

35:26.520 --> 35:31.720
very passive and not like so we we weren't even playing ingress we were doing pikmin and walking

35:31.720 --> 35:37.720
that and i got like 9 000 steps just walking with my friends and then i went back to the i had to

35:37.720 --> 35:41.560
pick up my sister at the airport i went back downtown after all that and i went out for

35:41.560 --> 35:46.520
stuffle community day and walked another like 8 000 steps walking around the capital several times

35:46.520 --> 35:53.560
so but i caught 19 shiny stuffles like it was again and i only blew i only bluetooth caught

35:53.560 --> 36:01.400
the whole time um it was one of those things where i was like i i after an hour and a half i was like

36:01.400 --> 36:07.320
i don't need this many stuffles i have 19 what am i going to do with these uh i'm done i have

36:07.320 --> 36:14.520
1200 candies i'm kind of done so but i had a very productive day so that was my like niantic day so

36:14.520 --> 36:19.720
i always forget to talk about the gps games but i play plenty of those as well it's not always just

36:19.720 --> 36:26.200
final fantasy and no man's sky whatever standbys i have also i played my burger time machine

36:27.720 --> 36:31.960
a little bit today really yeah i was trying to see if i could get the if i could get cheddar

36:31.960 --> 36:36.360
to be interested in it because smush really likes the light and the noise and i was trying to see if

36:36.360 --> 36:39.880
i could get cheddar interested in it so i played it a little bit to get the noise and all that

36:39.880 --> 36:44.360
he didn't care he didn't care so it's interesting how cats like different things that's for sure

36:45.480 --> 36:51.320
yeah midna would rather just like sit at the at the glass door and just watch everything outside

36:51.320 --> 36:56.360
you know cat tv no smush used to like get up on top of it and all that stuff too but now the

36:56.360 --> 37:00.920
cheddar's here he's his pastime is very much watching and patrolling whatever cheddar does

37:01.720 --> 37:08.520
so anyway all right let's get into some more video game headlines for this week i hope you all had a

37:08.520 --> 37:14.520
good week uh whether it was you know playing video games uh or going to something like pax east was

37:14.520 --> 37:20.520
this weekend um i know that was the first convention um in a long time for a lot of people

37:21.080 --> 37:27.400
i also know pax east did hecka precautions uh with mandated vaccines and masking so hopefully

37:27.400 --> 37:31.320
everything is okay i always think it's a good idea if you're going to go to a convention like

37:31.320 --> 37:36.760
that or whatever at least take a rapid test honestly just take the the nose swab test from

37:37.320 --> 37:41.400
uh a medical provider like three days don't do it the day after do it like three four days

37:41.400 --> 37:46.920
after just to make sure i think it's just always a good idea um i plan on going to dragon con over

37:46.920 --> 37:51.400
labor day i'm sure there will be precautions that's fine and i will take a test as soon as i

37:51.400 --> 37:56.200
get back just just to make sure just to be thorough but the reality is in this day and age

37:56.200 --> 38:01.000
you go anywhere with a lot of people covet's going to be there somewhere you know you everybody

38:01.000 --> 38:06.520
heard the story uninvited guest yeah everybody heard the story at gdc about the person who knew

38:06.520 --> 38:11.960
they had covid and went to the industry parties anyway and that's just the reality is that's the

38:11.960 --> 38:17.960
grocery store that's transit that's the airport that's a restaurant that is anywhere a lot of

38:17.960 --> 38:21.800
people hang out somebody is going to go full well knowing that they have covid so if you're going

38:21.800 --> 38:26.760
to be in close proximity with people in any of those situations look out for yourself you know

38:26.760 --> 38:34.040
just unless unless you truly don't care then i hope you have a speedy recovery that's that's uh

38:34.040 --> 38:42.200
like those people yeah it's that's all i got so all right moving on let's talk about in games

38:42.200 --> 38:50.600
uh headline from ubisoft you know ubisoft not only in the working conditions uh environment but in the

38:50.600 --> 38:56.040
nft's environment has been in headlines a lot lately which makes this headline very

38:56.040 --> 39:03.400
interesting about a new project they are working on called project q and a tweet for ubisoft wrote

39:03.960 --> 39:11.160
introducing code name project q a team battle arena letting players truly own the experience

39:11.160 --> 39:15.880
the game is an early development and we will keep testing so for now all you can do is register for

39:15.880 --> 39:22.120
upcoming tests well you see they kind of were forced their hand on sharing this because a

39:22.120 --> 39:28.840
leaker out there actually shared footage of the game uh saying that it looked a little bit like

39:28.840 --> 39:34.200
overwatch meets fortnite uh it's kind of what it looked like there was a mode called showdown where

39:34.200 --> 39:39.800
four teams of two go against one another to decide the winner and battle zone sees two teams of four

39:39.800 --> 39:44.680
going against each other to see who gets 100 points first but even though folks are saying

39:44.680 --> 39:49.480
oh it's overwatch meets fortnite ubisoft was quick to say this isn't a battle royale game

39:50.440 --> 39:55.080
which is so it's interesting to see ubisoft saying no it's not that not that by the way this

39:55.080 --> 40:01.560
is not a battle royale the game will feature a variety of pvp modes with one single goal in mind

40:02.200 --> 40:06.280
fun fun is the goal

40:06.280 --> 40:14.520
yeah i like fun too we'll see we'll see if it passes the the rob roberts and dark sakura fun

40:14.520 --> 40:20.680
test to be determined at a later date um also and i what also kind of cracks me up about this

40:20.680 --> 40:29.800
ubisoft also went to say there are no nfts in project q um because selling point ubisoft has

40:29.800 --> 40:34.280
been known to promote well it also goes to show what a big company ubisoft is you have different

40:34.280 --> 40:39.240
developers within ubisoft so i think this team is probably trying to separate itself from some

40:39.240 --> 40:44.520
of the other things ubisoft is known for which i think is very interesting so uh again if you want

40:44.520 --> 40:51.800
to what was that oh i said let's hope yeah if you want to uh sign up to uh check out project q you

40:51.800 --> 40:59.000
can do that over at register.ubisoft.com slash project q dash sign up uh and uh the project is

40:59.000 --> 41:06.680
coming out for xbox one xbox series playstation four and five and pc uh let's hope this one lasts

41:06.680 --> 41:13.880
and uh doesn't go the way of hyperscape which was a battle royale but apparently was not fun for

41:13.880 --> 41:20.040
enough people because uh nobody was playing it and so they shut it down or they're shutting it down

41:20.040 --> 41:28.440
but it is uh being uh and dated uh orange right is awarding one pat on the back for no nfts um

41:28.440 --> 41:36.840
s2100 matt says letting us know there are no nfts gets one clap fifth fifth dream says a loud one

41:36.840 --> 41:44.120
just sort of like a bad muted one like a like a golf clap no it was like this oh the hands just

41:44.680 --> 41:50.920
there was an attempt at clapping um fifth dream in chat says pick a pick a better letter ubi

41:51.560 --> 41:55.960
what's wrong with q what's what's your hatred with the letter q fifth dream

41:56.760 --> 42:01.160
q's probably an amazing character i was just gonna say q's my favorite character and bond

42:01.160 --> 42:06.440
what's wrong with that i i was actually talking about star trek oh that too star trek too

42:06.440 --> 42:11.880
yeah let's remember some famous cues in history

42:14.680 --> 42:20.600
anyway all right let's move on to our next story dark sakura what do you have for us next

42:21.640 --> 42:28.840
well nintendo is doing something ahead of schedule um you know we often hear about like games being

42:28.840 --> 42:37.400
delayed but we rarely hear about them coming out early and it looks that uh zenoblade chronicles

42:37.400 --> 42:44.760
3 um is actually coming out two months ahead of schedule on july 29th um but it looks like that

42:44.760 --> 42:51.080
instead of using whatever that early finish time you know to do more play testing and a

42:51.080 --> 42:57.000
little bit more work on it they're just bringing it out so who knows what that's gonna mean but

42:57.880 --> 43:03.960
we it's not like we haven't had games released early before uh like the upcoming game uh well

43:03.960 --> 43:10.440
not upcoming it's already out but the sifu that came out um it was due february 22nd it came out

43:10.440 --> 43:17.160
on february 8th and assassins creed 4 dropped early as well so it's not like we haven't had

43:17.160 --> 43:26.760
a few come out earlier but i still think that the date should be maintained so that

43:26.840 --> 43:32.120
again they can make sure that they have a good product here's why i'm gonna tell you 100 why

43:32.120 --> 43:36.680
because it relates to something bobby blackwolf said they bobby blackwolf in our chat says they

43:36.680 --> 43:40.920
probably have another game that will come out when xc3 was originally going to come out so they

43:40.920 --> 43:47.960
rearrange things also in the news this week splatoon 3 which hadn't been dated yet but was

43:47.960 --> 43:55.400
generally considered to be a summer game was given a date 9 9 2022 so it's going to get the dreamcast

43:55.400 --> 44:01.000
day of 9 9 so that's getting a september release they're calling it a summer release because

44:01.000 --> 44:06.360
technically you know summer runs through september 21st right so it's a summer release but it's it's

44:06.360 --> 44:13.320
september summer so um that comment from bobby i think is 100 on the nose splatoon ended up taking

44:13.320 --> 44:19.000
this i think i think splatoon got delayed but since they never said it was going to come out

44:19.000 --> 44:25.240
on a certain day it's not a delay but i think the fact they're rearranging the calendar i think

44:25.240 --> 44:29.320
goes to show that splatoon was probably originally going to be the july game

44:29.320 --> 44:33.640
and ended up getting pushed back to september which you know if it needs more time than fine

44:33.640 --> 44:40.040
whatever i think but it's it also interesting i just think xc3 has probably been done it's

44:40.040 --> 44:44.680
probably been done and they're they're in the final stages of it and it was completely about

44:44.680 --> 44:49.960
release strategy going into the holiday season and all of that absolutely but um

44:49.960 --> 44:55.400
especially when it was already out there that xc2 and three were in development side by side so

44:55.400 --> 45:00.840
three's probably been done for a few months now and it's really just a release release strategy

45:00.840 --> 45:05.960
thing at this point and so now they don't want to compete against themselves although splatoon and

45:05.960 --> 45:11.880
xenoblade are very different genres you're still asking nintendo fans who are probably interested

45:11.880 --> 45:17.160
in both to plunk down 60 and another 60 so it's best if they space them out a little bit so that

45:17.400 --> 45:21.960
they space them out a little bit so that you you know you'll pay 60 in july and then 60 in

45:21.960 --> 45:28.680
september um on a somewhat related note i thought it was very interesting you know uh it was there

45:28.680 --> 45:32.920
was a tweet going around earlier today that came across my timeline and it didn't make me stop and

45:32.920 --> 45:38.840
go that is interesting that we're talking about xenoblade chronicles 3 being a tent pole release

45:38.840 --> 45:46.920
essentially for the switch at this point right do you remember folks think back think back about 10

45:47.720 --> 45:53.720
a little more think back to the wii era like 2008 2009 do you remember the first xenoblade chronicles

45:53.720 --> 46:03.640
game and how nintendo wouldn't put it out in america and yeah how it took a little operation

46:03.640 --> 46:09.800
rainfall to finally get that game to get released uh along with some other there were some other

46:09.800 --> 46:15.880
games involved with that as well um but that game finally got released it was a gamestop exclusive

46:15.880 --> 46:22.120
which i still to this day say was garbage but whatever at least it was released um and you know

46:22.120 --> 46:27.160
because many people were just pirating it at that point i may or may not be one of them but that

46:27.160 --> 46:32.280
game was so good uh at least it finally got in front of the eyes of other people and it's just

46:32.280 --> 46:37.960
interesting to me how far we've come because since then then we had xenoblades chronicles x

46:37.960 --> 46:43.160
on the wii u which you know it was wii u but i think it was still very well received as a wii u

46:43.160 --> 46:50.120
title um and then of course the remaster came out for the switch and i i believe it did pretty well

46:50.120 --> 46:54.520
uh well enough anyway to necessitate xenoblade chronicles two and three now so this is very

46:54.520 --> 47:03.000
interesting that like this series is causing release strategy shifts in the u.s when nintendo

47:03.000 --> 47:08.520
didn't even want to do this game in the u.s originally so can all of the supporters of

47:08.520 --> 47:15.240
operation rainfall please just take a moment to say we were right and doesn't that feel good

47:15.880 --> 47:22.360
doesn't that feel good uh bobby blackwolf says the lost story was the other one i think yes

47:22.360 --> 47:27.480
there was that there was one other pandora something was the other there was one other

47:27.480 --> 47:32.360
uh there was because there were three and they all did get released eventually um yeah so yeah

47:32.360 --> 47:37.480
it was uh pandora's tower thank you orange right that was the other one so um they all did of

47:37.480 --> 47:43.080
course the other two i don't think ever did get follow-ups uh was lost story a mistwalker title

47:43.640 --> 47:48.680
there was it was from a studio everybody wanted to play it because it was from a particular studio

47:49.400 --> 47:55.800
um but it never ended up yeah it was mistwalker so mistwalker kind of went a different direction and

47:55.800 --> 48:02.280
now um fantasion is the most recent thing they've done right so um yeah so uh but last story i i kind

48:02.280 --> 48:07.400
of Asian is great just you know annoying i wish they would revisit some of these you know it's

48:08.120 --> 48:14.200
such a fascinating studio because they keep doing these rpgs that just don't stick for whatever

48:14.200 --> 48:20.280
reason that's not i'm not talking about fantasion i'm talking about before that blue dragon i lost

48:20.280 --> 48:27.720
odyssey so kind of turned a little bit weird did it yeah the thing the thing is is that like

48:28.280 --> 48:32.440
playing through the game is easy the boss battles are harder than the advertised level

48:32.440 --> 48:38.520
hmm uh and bobby blackwolf says it was the last story not the lost story you're probably mind

48:38.520 --> 48:43.400
melding with lost odyssey which was also a mistwalker title it happens that was ways back

48:43.400 --> 48:47.480
anyway i'm sorry i just had to point that out as i was like here we are talking about release date

48:47.480 --> 48:52.360
strategies around zw a chronicles 3 when nintendo didn't even want to release the first one in the

48:52.360 --> 48:59.000
us so i just think how far we've come and kudos to the fans for speaking up you know as much as we

48:59.080 --> 49:05.400
talk about you know angry fanboys when it comes to nintendo i think operation rainfall did did

49:05.400 --> 49:10.920
it appropriately and look at the look at the big victory here all these years later now we just

49:10.920 --> 49:15.240
need the xenoblade chronicles x re-release on switch because a lot of people missed it on weu

49:15.240 --> 49:24.040
and it had great music all right anyhow when before xenogears came out that they had a mention

49:24.040 --> 49:30.280
of it in final fantasy 7 and no one got it because of how they spelled it right it was

49:30.280 --> 49:37.000
when cloud was in the the wheelchair and not himself and one of the things he would mumble

49:37.000 --> 49:47.880
was xenogias which is a literal romanization of how it would be spelled in katakana i love when

49:47.880 --> 49:53.880
games subtly reference each other i love it it's like this little inside joke that only we get

49:54.920 --> 49:59.320
i also i also love the concept of video games being set in like the same universe

50:01.000 --> 50:08.040
evil is in final fantasy i love the concept of like tactics and final fantasy 12 and in my brain

50:08.040 --> 50:13.400
in my head canon and i know i know yoshi p has come out and said no but in my head canon final

50:13.400 --> 50:20.600
fantasy 14 is an evil is game um and i i i realize there are elements about the story that definitely

50:20.600 --> 50:26.120
differentiate it from evil is but i it's it's uh it's an evil is in a different part of the

50:26.120 --> 50:32.440
multiverse game to me and i think i think 16 will be an evil is game too to be quite honest i just

50:32.440 --> 50:36.440
don't think that's been confirmed yet but that's that's maybe wishful thinking on my part but it

50:36.440 --> 50:41.480
is creative unit 3 doing it and it's those are a lot of the people that worked on those games

50:41.480 --> 50:47.800
so i think uh i think there's a strong chance 16 is an evil is game and i hope so so all right

50:47.800 --> 50:57.800
moving on speaking of great things from the past dark soccer well um oh am i i'm sorry am i next

50:57.800 --> 51:02.840
oh my bad i'm sorry you see you see what happens we lose one person for the night and the entire

51:02.840 --> 51:07.720
rotation gets screwed up well you still left him in in the show role for another segment

51:08.680 --> 51:12.520
well you know things happen that's right you were on last week's show always a part of the

51:12.520 --> 51:15.720
show yeah i was like you were in last week's show even though you're at disneyland so

51:15.720 --> 51:20.920
all right let's talk about this instead let's talk about nintendo uh and the nintendo switch

51:20.920 --> 51:27.960
online and uh there's been a leak of the nintendo switch online uh because it includes unreleased

51:27.960 --> 51:36.040
nes games um this was apparently something that was leaked over to um because this has to do with

51:36.040 --> 51:42.680
another thing i'm going to talk about here uh oh this doesn't have the piece on the um gameboy

51:42.680 --> 51:48.040
advance part hold on sorry i was looking at a story that talked about the nes titles that

51:48.040 --> 51:53.000
have been discovered in the emulator as well but it all started with a gameboy gameboy color game

51:53.000 --> 52:00.360
boy advance switch online emulator pack uh that was originally posted to 4chan sigh but leaks

52:00.360 --> 52:06.920
happened there uh four files popped up on there and some twitter users braved 4chan to get in

52:06.920 --> 52:14.520
there and talk and like see what's there uh there was a uh 7z archive that had loose nca's it was a

52:14.520 --> 52:20.280
gameboy emulator uh made by nerd it's nintendo's team that works on other classics for switch

52:20.280 --> 52:26.520
online the gameboy advance emulator calls sloop um so now some folks are saying you know 4chan

52:26.520 --> 52:32.040
it's got a hit and miss type of track record but the consensus right now is that this one's legit

52:32.040 --> 52:37.720
because builds of three nintendo switch online apps they're usable and they're playable

52:37.720 --> 52:42.920
and they're a source code that has identifying information from nintendo devs so all the signs

52:42.920 --> 52:50.920
point to this is legit otherwise this wouldn't catch fire the way it did um so we have news

52:50.920 --> 52:57.800
that a gameboy advance emulator is being worked on uh for the uh nintendo switch and there are

52:57.800 --> 53:02.760
games like pokemon pinball that show up in the list uh which i think are things that i would

53:02.760 --> 53:08.840
love to play all over again i checked something trying to follow back a link on one of those

53:08.840 --> 53:17.240
tweets and the account is dead the account's gone oh really yeah the one who was talking about the

53:17.240 --> 53:24.200
analog support and the helco emulator i wonder if there was an nda so because i wonder if nintendo

53:24.200 --> 53:29.160
maybe tried to shut it down or something who knows so that account is gone i wonder if this

53:29.160 --> 53:34.440
other one is anyway the other one is still there that's very interesting some sometimes people

53:34.440 --> 53:37.560
don't like the attention either and they might have changed their name to break all the links

53:37.560 --> 53:43.720
or something i don't know so anyway um but this doesn't mean that it's coming tomorrow it doesn't

53:43.720 --> 53:49.800
mean it's coming in june even it does it just means nintendo's working on it um but that could

53:49.800 --> 53:58.200
be working out in the way future i thought it showed interesting things about um uh like how

53:58.200 --> 54:04.440
they use save states to really practice some things in emulators and they actually had save

54:04.440 --> 54:09.320
states that talked about like you know there's a certain texture used in this part of the game

54:09.320 --> 54:13.960
and that they'll use those to test certain part of the emulators and that kind of made me click

54:13.960 --> 54:22.040
and go aha that's where those sp releases are coming from you know how on the nso they

54:22.040 --> 54:28.200
apparently like you know every other month or so they'll release like a kid Icarus sp edition

54:28.200 --> 54:33.000
and all it is is basically a safe state that takes you directly to the last level in the game

54:33.000 --> 54:36.680
so you can see how the very last level in kid Icarus is nothing like the rest of the game

54:37.240 --> 54:43.880
it's it's very unique i i feel like those safe states some of them are just becoming the sp

54:43.880 --> 54:49.320
edition of the game um or uh the other one that comes to mind it was one of the first ones they

54:49.320 --> 54:54.840
ever did it was the legend of zelda um i don't remember what they called it but it was the money

54:54.840 --> 55:01.720
filled edition it already had like every item 255 rupees it had like everything already unlocked and

55:01.720 --> 55:05.720
i was like that was just a safe state for nintendo to test things in that game that's what that was

55:06.680 --> 55:13.960
then they ended up releasing it as like a bonus game that's clever anyway the leak didn't just

55:13.960 --> 55:20.040
leak that this gameboy advance uh emulators being worked on is that there was also unreleased nes

55:20.040 --> 55:28.760
games including pac-man tetris galaga mega man castlevania lots of games that make you go wow

55:28.760 --> 55:35.240
this really is missing it's also interesting to note the build date for the application october

55:35.240 --> 55:45.000
2019 so they've been on this for a minute uh-huh now of course just because now see here's where

55:45.000 --> 55:50.360
my brain goes i don't think just because the games were in the emulator they were ever being planned

55:50.360 --> 55:55.160
on coming out because that's a licensing thing especially because this has all these mega man

55:55.160 --> 56:00.840
games in there well hello capcom released a mega man's collection for the switch already they don't

56:00.840 --> 56:05.000
want to just give these games to nintendo for free unless i mean maybe they'll they'll get a

56:05.000 --> 56:10.920
money sharing thing later on but they're probably holding out but my guess is nintendo was probably

56:10.920 --> 56:17.000
internally testing these to test the emulator to make sure that it was still good in case either

56:17.560 --> 56:22.040
these games were ever just gonna you know they get the deal inked out these games come out someday

56:22.040 --> 56:29.320
or um and i think this is the case with xbox or emulation in general and i know we have an

56:29.320 --> 56:34.920
emulation expert in our discord server and i may or may not get corrected but just following this

56:34.920 --> 56:42.040
over the years when you get a certain thing in emulation to work it usually causes other similar

56:42.040 --> 56:47.320
games to work for example in the nintendo universe you hear a lot about mappers right you get one

56:47.320 --> 56:53.480
mapper carpetridge type to work it usually means others that also run on that mapper will also work

56:53.480 --> 56:59.080
i say xbox because i think back to that story when remember when like barbie dream adventures

56:59.720 --> 57:05.400
ended up becoming a backwards compatible xbox 360 title everybody was like why did microsoft waste

57:05.400 --> 57:10.200
their fucking time making that barbie game backwards compatible and i've been saying since

57:10.200 --> 57:16.280
the beginning they didn't it's just another game that we don't know of that they did want to get

57:16.280 --> 57:22.760
backwards compatible ran on a very similar type of coding structure engine something that the barbie

57:22.760 --> 57:27.800
game did and so you know look at look at other games of that developer or that publisher did

57:27.800 --> 57:33.160
and whatever microsoft did to get that game running also made barbie work and so i think

57:33.160 --> 57:37.800
and that's my long-winded way of saying these mega man games showing up in this emulator build

57:37.800 --> 57:44.680
may not really be about mega man it's probably more about the emulator because i i again i don't

57:44.680 --> 57:50.120
see what capcom has to gain when they're selling these games independently for their own money

57:50.680 --> 57:56.520
to just say okay nsl go ahead and release them on your service until they're sure that they're not

57:56.520 --> 58:01.640
going to make any more money off that game and nintendo opens up their wallet enough so what do

58:01.640 --> 58:07.080
you want to bet if these mega man games do show up it's going to be on the plus service expansion

58:07.080 --> 58:11.800
pack whatever the fuck they call it because they need that extra money so that they can funnel some

58:11.800 --> 58:19.800
of it over to capcom tetris i'm sure is a legal issue at this point um can they re-release the

58:19.800 --> 58:25.720
old tetris i'm sure it's complicated granted they have tetris 99 but tetris 99 and the original

58:25.720 --> 58:28.920
tetris on india they are different games and legally have to be treated differently

58:30.760 --> 58:35.960
castlevania and simon's quest same logic why would konami just suddenly open those

58:35.960 --> 58:39.400
up on nintendo switch online when they're trying to sell you the castlevania collection

58:42.440 --> 58:50.920
so i i think some blogs and some people on twitter are reading too much into this and i

58:50.920 --> 58:57.960
think maybe need to take a step back and go oh this is just more about testing the emulator or

58:57.960 --> 59:03.400
maybe these games are ready to come out as soon as the deal gets inked legally but i don't know

59:03.400 --> 59:10.680
if it will ever get inked legally pac-man um i hate to sound like a broken record but like

59:10.680 --> 59:15.720
literally in the next two weeks there's a pac-man museum game coming out why does why does namco

59:15.720 --> 59:22.360
want to put pac-man out on nso why they're trying to sell pac-man museum now i do look

59:22.360 --> 59:27.720
at other games in here like kung fu the original kung fu on the nes which was an arcade game as

59:27.720 --> 59:36.600
well i'm not sure why that game can't be released unless like was there an actual tie-in to

59:36.600 --> 59:43.160
something that i'm just missing in the moment with that game legally but yeah that's interesting

59:43.160 --> 59:49.640
i actually love that game by the way they must have some reasons yeah so i mean they

59:50.440 --> 59:53.880
there's they don't have to tell us what the reasons are that's just the thing they don't

59:53.880 --> 01:00:00.680
have to tell us but it's interesting the more people speculate on it that just generates more

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:06.680
publicity for them oh sure sure uh now this is interesting over in chat ah thank thank you

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:12.760
orange right kung fu was based on an iram arcade game kung fu master ding ding that's it that's

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:17.800
why it's legally still tied up i remember the arcade game being awesome and then they they

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:23.160
ported it pretty well to the nes so thank you everybody uh and dgrms says iram is too busy

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:33.480
milking r-type to deal with kung fu well yeah how many r-type finals have we um s2100 matt says i

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.120
remember when folks hacked the playstation classic and folks saw that they had tested a ton of other

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:42.600
games on it including anime fighting games the whole list of games they used to test on it would

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:48.360
have made that thing better than a dust collector for sure uh fifth dream in chat says maybe that

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:55.400
contract worker at nintendo from earlier leaked the emulators i don't think the contractor would

01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:03.400
have access to those files but it's it's cute fanfic but probably not rooted in reality i'm

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:10.360
sorry to say yeah all right uh let's go on to our next story now we can go to dark sakura's story

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:19.880
so um well activision blizzard is doing something right um i mean then again they're kind of having

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:30.040
to do it they have to yeah yeah um so they are adding two uh women senior executives to the

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:40.200
board um they are announcing that uh lulu cheng miss messervay i guess that's how it's pronounced

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:46.360
is uh joining immediately and then they're nominating carrie kar for election in their

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:53.240
annual meeting in june um which so far they've actually uh activision blizzard has been in

01:01:53.240 --> 01:02:00.120
violation of law that requires uh publicly traded companies with six or more people on the board

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:08.120
to have at least three women directors um and then half of activision's 10 person board has been

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:15.400
together for nearly uh two decades um eight men and two women currently sit on the board

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:25.160
um two however uh hendrick hart hartung the third and casey washerman have chosen not to go for

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:38.840
re-election so um so uh messervay is uh the vp of communication at substack and car is uh svp with

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:46.760
bacardi and an alum of the walt disney company so interesting there you go well the representation

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.240
is important it's interesting that there's you know the law and all that as well with the board

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:57.640
that's that's pretty neat um so it's good but um also i hope i hope these folks have been vetted

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:02.520
um because that's still important as well because the next story we have is about an executive who

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:08.600
is a woman who um maybe i don't allegedly not so great i don't know i've heard a lot of things

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:13.960
about this woman uh and she's on facebooks i actually have one more little thing to add on

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:19.160
please please if you don't mind yeah of course the soc investment group is actually urging investors

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:28.040
to vote against uh the activision blizzard acquisition the merger so um they own a small

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:35.560
percentage of activision stock um and they are calling for them to elect a new competent and

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:41.240
dedicated board of directors that's my quote um before it's going to go through and so i think

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:48.760
that this might be part of that this was announced uh last week i have heard of them going that in

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.880
there yeah no that's perfect i've heard of a lot of pushback to bobby kotex payout too you know

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:59.400
a lot of senators were voicing their opinions on that as well as that uh the deal shouldn't go

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.680
through because of bobby kotex payout his ass needs to be kicked to the curb paid out in rotten

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:11.160
prunes he needs to be paid out in a pink slip in a cardboard box like his contractors have he

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.840
should be given a bunch of prunes and be forced to eat it before he leaves well wait until you

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:23.880
hear what i have next dark sakura because it involves the tale of bobby kotek and the coo

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:32.520
or chief operating officer of facebook excuse me meta cheryl sandberg that's who i was referencing

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:42.200
a moment ago meta is under an investigation if cheryl sandberg broke company rules by um act by

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:48.760
uh basically trying to do a favor for activision ceo bobby kotek who she was dating at the time

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:57.160
oh how the world fuck i mean i just these bobby kotex stories anyone want to date him other than

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:02.280
maybe having him be a sugar daddy but she would have she would have enough money yeah like she's

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:10.760
i'm exhausted even just after the first sentence of this article but let me continue

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:18.440
according to a report in the wall street journal who keeps breaking these stories that going on

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:23.080
in the game industry so snaps and actual claps to the wall street journal and journalists who

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.160
are getting getting it fucking done uh when it comes to holding these companies accountable

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:33.640
uh according to this report so i have to say allegedly bold underlying italicize but according

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:39.160
to the report cheryl sandberg used company resources to kill negative reporting about

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:45.560
kotek so due to this meta is conducting a review and whether she violated the company's rules

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:51.480
the british tabloid mail online was pursuing is that the daily fail it must be it must be

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:56.280
the daily fails online the daily actually yeah the daily mail um yeah everybody calls it the

01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:02.440
daily fail they're listed by by that name so the daily fail was working on a story

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:09.560
uh based on allegations from a former girlfriend of bobby kotex and a temporary restraining order

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:16.440
that she got against him but cheryl sandberg and kotek worked together in 2016 and 2019 according

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:23.800
to this report to strategize on how to persuade the daily mail to not report on the restraining

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:30.280
order facebook and activision staff were both directly involved with this and the concern at

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.560
facebook was that the story would quote reflect negatively on her reputation as an advocate for

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:41.400
women because remember she's dating him at the time wall street she's really an advocate for

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:50.280
women she wouldn't have been dating the shit yes i don't know what else to say uh the wall

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:56.280
street journal also openly questions if sandberg inappropriately used her influence as facebook

01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:04.440
coo in dealing with mail online's management an unnamed source told that or said that kotek

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:11.080
quote told people that miss sandberg threatened the mail in 2016 by saying that such an article

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:16.360
published could damage the news organization's business relationship with facebook

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:24.760
why is the daily mail called the daily fail because of all their fucking clickbait headlines

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:30.120
and clickbait articles that they write on a regular basis who is the number one peddler

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:37.880
of those headlines but they do have a big readership oh sure people and people believe

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:42.120
stupid tabloids people especially if there's a grain of truth in it are you telling me dark

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:47.720
sakura here on this day on episode 911 of orange luxury are you telling me

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.440
that stupid people click stupid links are you telling me

01:07:52.760 --> 01:08:01.000
my point is that if they have a concern about this affecting public opinion of the piece of shit

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:07.880
and her association with the piece of shit then it's a valid concern i mean they're both pieces

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:14.680
of shit but now more people will know how much shitty they are uh pele hanumea and chat says

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:19.720
bat boy marries princess diana that's the daily mail no that was weekly world news i'm almost

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:27.400
positive daily mail will post like legit stuff every so often what does it what does it say

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:33.160
what does it say about my sad brain that i knew which tabloid it was and to correct this

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:41.800
well-intentioned listener on their comment i have i will be taking no i have no further comment at

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:49.640
this time let's go back to uh uh this saga going on over here it should be pointed out the mail

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:57.240
online never published its story on kotak uh a meta spokesperson denied that sandberg threatened

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:01.560
uh mail online saying cheryl sandberg never threatened the mail online's business relationship

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:06.600
with facebook in order to influence an editorial decision this story attempts to make connections

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:11.240
that don't exist uh bobby kotak said to the journal he never said anything like that

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:19.160
activisions board of directors said it did a thorough investigation into an incident in 2014

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:25.640
and that they have full confidence in mr kotak's leadership holy shit is that a lot to unpack

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:38.120
right there because um i mean how many times has the activision board of directors come to say

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:43.000
we have confidence in bobby kotak we have confidence in what's going on here when

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.800
when honestly truly there is no reason to have that type of trust in bobby kotak

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:56.040
they did a thorough investigation in 2014 what can you detail for me activision what that

01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:01.240
investigation was because it sounds like that investigation was throwing it a deep doc drawer

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.240
locking it and throwing away the key

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:11.640
if you would care to hear another quote boy do i have one for you the board has been aware of the

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:17.480
circumstances reporting involving an incident in 2014 around the time of the incident in 2014

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:22.760
mr kotak notified the senior independent director of the board has subsequently updated the full

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.720
board and has been fully transparent with the board the board through its council scadden arps

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:32.760
has done a thorough and what a name i'm probably mispronouncing it but do i really care at this

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.400
point has done a thorough examination of the facts and circumstances of the event satisfied

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.880
itself that there was no merit to the allegations and notes that they concern a personal relationship

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:47.160
that has nothing to do with the business of the company the board continues to have full confidence

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:53.640
in mr kotak's leadership and his ability to run the company i'm exhausted

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:04.040
anyway uh before we get to our next story i see the raid there from bromigos so i want to say

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:09.160
thank you thank you for that usually uh we're recording a podcast and so we sometimes are

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.080
really bad about doing the twitch things of acknowledging all the things when they happen

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.840
because our podcast listeners can't see that or any of that but i do want to say thank you thank

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:22.120
you for that it is appreciated and hope you guys are having a wonderful night um hi and welcome to

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:28.840
orange launch radio we've been doing this far too long uh if i had justice the scrolls on the bottom

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.880
our first episode was back in 2002 so i want to thank you all for being here for um our episode

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.320
tonight uh dark sakura and myself here loki with the night off as he had just had surgery earlier

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:45.400
this week and is recovering uh let's get into some more stories uh especially after that last story

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:53.720
about really it's it's honestly it's rich executives scratching each other on the back

01:11:53.720 --> 01:12:00.760
literally and figuratively in this particular case and it just it's just exhausting to hear about

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:08.280
and why mr kotak is still employed in this industry i will never understand never understand

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.920
i i hope that once he's out the door that that's the last we hear of him

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.280
i hope that door gives him a swallow a solid thwack in the buttocks on his way out

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:28.280
all right let's i need happy news dark sakura make me happy make me happy only you can make

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:37.960
yourself happy rob is it the same anyway um sega is doing something cool they are uh doing reboots

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:46.040
of crazy taxi and just their radio and it's going to be big budget stuff too they are uh

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:54.440
the projects are part of something called super game initiative it's a plan that sega sammy has

01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:01.720
had since last year so they wanted uh the the quote is um they want to develop all new and

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:07.160
innovative titles with a focus on global reach online interactivity community building and ip

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:15.240
utilization um and that's where the working with microsoft for the azure cloud platform comes in

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:23.720
so they want to uh use some of its dormant ip's for remakes remasters and reboots and by name

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:29.880
they said crazy taxi and jet set radio as candidates um other games on the list of space

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:39.640
channel 5 res panzer dragoon knight shinobi um virtue fighter and altered beast yes to literally

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:46.920
everything on this list literally everything crazy taxi and jet set radio were up on the top of the

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:55.320
list according to bloomberg um they have um done remasters remakes things for other dreamcast era

01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:01.720
properties um crazy taxi and jet set radio were on the sega 2011 dreamcast collection

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:10.200
there were more i actually have crazy taxi for ipad which is actually not bad um uh there's also

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:17.400
uh crazy taxi ty tycoon which was originally called uh crazy taxi gazillionaire which is a

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:24.840
business management sim slash idol game um they've outsourced a lot of their ip revivals though

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:31.080
including streets of rage 4 panzer dragoon remake alex kid miracle world dx and house of the dead

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:37.880
remake to indie developers so we'll see what happens but right now sega is kind of riding

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:47.320
high on the the sonic revenue and um they're also looking into adapting uh yakuza and streets of

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:54.920
rage so we'll see how that goes i want a streets of rage music uh the movie if the soundtrack is

01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:01.880
done by yuzo koshido well you may be in luck uh elsewhere in the industry this week apparently

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:06.600
this i i swear i read this somewhere the sonic director is interested in streets of rage

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:14.200
so but i knew about that yeah so but because i i actually brought that up two weeks ago oh okay uh

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:19.480
yuzo koshiro said somewhere that he wanted to be involved that doesn't mean his phone's ringing yet

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:25.720
yeah i hadn't seen anything about about that but i mean could you imagine if he did

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:33.640
like modern mixes of the original music that would be rad um in our chat they're talking

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:39.480
about like crazy taxi and these remixes um dark tetsuya says i saw someone on twitter

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:45.080
suggests a battle royale style take on crazy taxi and it sounds ridiculous enough to be fun

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:51.240
i actually think that would be awesome um like not necessarily 100 people but just even like that

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:56.680
sense of like 10 people all playing on the same map at the same time trying to pick up the same

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:01.240
people and get to the same spots i think that actually would be really funny that sounds really

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:08.600
funny it's only fun to me really i think it'd be fun i don't like i i i wouldn't like that i

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:14.200
like to get in and play it solo and be done it's it's always a solo game well it's not always be

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:22.120
as an option maybe i don't even i know but i when they when they put options in games like that

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:30.520
they have some sort of reward that forces you to play it and no um i also think um

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:37.960
crazy taxi is not crazy taxi uh unless it has that offspring song in it because only sometimes

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:43.080
they've been able to to get that you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like it's it's just not for

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:53.080
me it was more about the the um bad religion music i whenever 10 in 2010 came on that was my song

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:58.600
uh tiger cloud points out that whole soundtrack yeah sorry tiger points out it wasn't the sonic

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:04.200
director for streets of rage it was the writer for john wick my bad um the other one i wanted

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:08.600
to point out they were talking about panzer dragoon so quest buster says um as mike deaf

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:14.120
pointed out panzer dragoon had a remake unless they're talking about rebooting a new chapter

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:20.200
or the series which i'd love to see yeah i think that remake kind of had a soft land um it

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:23.800
definitely needed a patch to get to the place where it needed to be so i'm wondering if it

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:29.880
isn't maybe a new game or the reality is it's on the list but it's not at the top of the list

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.680
and you know at the top of the list they've already done that that third party remake yeah

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:40.840
as i mentioned so i i i would doubt very seriously i mean what i would actually like them to do

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:48.840
is if they did remake anything is if they did a remake of a panzer dragoon rpg or what was it

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:57.240
here panzer dragoon saga i think i i've got a copy somewhere all right um but that would be

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:01.800
nice because that game is is pretty amazing all right well let's talk about about what's excuse

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.160
me i have the hiccups you guys the worst thing that can happen to me when trying to do a show

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:12.360
um let's move on and talk about uh something that sega is doing which is sonic origins and we got

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:18.920
some new information on that this week so sonic origins uh is going to be coming to the the switch

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:23.320
but i believe it's coming to other platforms as well i just happen to be looking at a story on a

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:30.040
nintendo-based website um but it's a remastered collection of the original sonic the hedgehog

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:36.440
titles um so sonic did announce that the release date is june 23rd hey just in time for my birthday

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:42.440
and by the way it is the switch it's ps5 for xbox series and xbox one so it's you know most

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:48.840
of the normal areas you'd expect um sega's announced it's coming out on june 23rd and it's

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:56.760
going to be available in these different editions it's based basically standard digital deluxe and

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:04.680
three different dlcs with it which is uh yeah that's a lot it is a lot there's a start dash

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:10.840
pack uh with 100 bonus coins mirror mode already unlocked in a letterbox background there's a

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:17.560
premium fun pack with hard missions letterbox animations in the main menu and camera controls

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:23.320
in the main menu islands there is a classic music track with additional music tracks from

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:29.400
the mega drive and genesis titles so i i don't know if all this is really necessary um but okay

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:34.600
go off and honestly i'm gonna be honest when i first saw this trailer i was like

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:42.840
what these games have been released so many times they re-released rather so many times

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:49.320
you know we've had sonic one two and three and knuckles every more like since the playstation

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:56.520
3 xbox 360 there's been a sega collection that has had it in it i could swear sonic 3 has been in that

01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:02.440
too but maybe maybe not the current like genesis emulation or whatever all right they're saying in

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:08.760
chat that sonic 3 has not been released in a long time i'll believe them that's fine but even then

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:16.680
it's you know just sonic 3 i guess sonic 1 and 2 of you'll come out a million times um some people

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.160
people also say it's because of the michael jackson involvement with the sonic 3 that that

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:28.680
one's kind of the the harder one to get re-done for whatever reason but it's not just and to be

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:34.280
fair it's not just that the games are re-releasing it's that they are done in the higher resolution

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:39.880
so it's you know crisp pixels i guess there is new opening and ending animations for each title

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:45.400
there are unlockables to get new content and special stages and then there's classic and

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:51.080
anniversary mode which basically the anniversary mode is a full screen so it uses wide screen

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.440
play the old games but in widescreen which is kind of interesting uh and as chat is pointing

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:02.440
out basically they're doing these games in the sonic mania engine which is interesting but i'm

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:09.880
not sure that dlc is a smart thing to do with this especially right out the gate to announce that all

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.880
this is there they probably should have released it and then trickled out the dlc probably would

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:18.760
have been a smarter way to do it but they really want to lock in those pre-orders that's for sure

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:24.120
so but i don't know i think i think they're asking a little much for it considering how many times

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:29.240
i've played played sonic the hedgehog in recent years but i do think that the widescreen mode

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:38.600
it's interesting but is it 30 interesting i don't know so all right well let's travel back and

01:21:38.600 --> 01:22:07.880
revisit a classic game in our next segment and dark sakura what did you pick for the classic

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:17.960
game tonight i picked tetranet yeah we've talked about it many many a time a lot of us have

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:25.240
memories of it well i'm bringing it up now tetranet um and tetranet i apologize i need

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.120
to step away for just one minute to deal with the hiccups i'll be back sorry all right tetranet is

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:40.200
an online multiplayer version of tetris that supports up to six people and has team play so

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:50.280
it first came out in 1997 it had releases for microsoft windows unix mac os 10 and bayos

01:22:51.240 --> 01:23:00.280
um it was developed by stormcat and the o is a zero because it was um the last official version

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:06.920
is version 1.13 and it was originally developed for windows and later ported to the other systems

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:15.720
stormcat also released tetranet 2 in 2000 that has improved graphics uh different types of special

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:22.600
blocks more types and additional features like a hold piece and block shadows and a master server

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:31.160
so um as far as um the game it basically is a standard multiplayer tetris with a twist

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:38.120
if you clear a row it will cause special blocks to appear in your field if a line containing a

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:46.120
special block is cleared then that block is added to your inventory clearing those lines at once

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:51.400
multiple lines at once increases the number of special blocks that you get so at any point you

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:58.360
can use a special block um at the at the start of your inventory on one of the six fields which is

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:06.200
one of your uh either your own or other people's uh or your opponents excuse me so it depends on

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:12.600
which type of block you're going to use so a is add a line where it adds a broken line

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:19.800
c is clear line which clears the line on the bottom of the field uh b is clear special blocks

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:25.880
which causes all special blocks to return to normal blocks r is random blocks clear so random

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:31.960
blocks are removed from the target field so that gives you gaps in your lines um o is a bomb block

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:41.320
which uh causes uh block bombs to explode and scatters uh other blocks throughout your play

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:48.600
field q is block quake which causes blocks on each line to shift and sort of like an earthquake

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:55.880
effect uh g is block gravity where the blocks on the field just immediately fall into whatever

01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:04.600
gap happens to be there and deletes the completed line um s is to switch fields so you actually

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.640
switch your play field with somebody else and n is nuke field which removes all blocks from the

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:15.320
target field the last player to still be able to place pieces in their field is the winner

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:20.600
um and depending on the server use there are alternate rules sometimes there is pure

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:25.560
where special blocks are disabled so it's just everyone is playing multiplayer tetris

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:33.320
and then seven tetris where the first player to make seven seven tetrises is the winner so

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:42.120
there are those modes um the music in this one um it it's it's called the dance of the spheres

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:48.200
it's been everywhere like they made a step mania chart for this um what i don't remember that

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:56.520
that's awesome yeah um it's the authorship is claimed by someone named uh david is it might be

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:04.200
although there are other sources that say davy m carlson is the composer um

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:11.160
back in the day we thought this was hot shit today i can't stand listening to it i mean i i was like

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.520
okay jamming for a little bit a little bit nostalgia then after i was like okay i'm done

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:23.480
um so there are also um different variables you can add to the tetranet uh 1.13 client

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:31.720
different variables um one is called tetra tetra fast which removes the one second delay between

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:39.720
the pieces that you find and the standard tetranet gameplay um after uh when the police

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:46.360
sorry police piece delay is implemented on the client side it's just a modification that keeps

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:54.360
clients from from having it happen to the you know you basically there's you only connect

01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:01.640
to people playing tetra fast um there's also uh one called tetranet slash tetra fast 1.14 with

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:07.880
the 1.14 protocol is a variant where everyone receives the same sequence of pieces there's

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:14.360
block tris um that's for the windows client um where it also supports the tetranet and tetra

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.120
fast protocols but it also has additional special block types one is for left gravity which pulls

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:27.800
the blocks to the left as far as possible piece change that changes your current piece and zebra

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:37.560
field which clears every second column on the field um then for tetranet 2 um it's another

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:43.800
multiplayer tetris done by the original creator um the five new blocks it adds is immunity where

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:51.000
the target cannot be affected by any special uh for 15 seconds clear column that deletes a column

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.840
from the field mutate pieces that causes um the target's next pieces a default of three to become

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:04.680
large and awkwardly shaped darkness where you can't see anything on the field beside your

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:10.040
current piece and its immediate surroundings for 10 seconds confusion that causes your controls to

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:18.200
get mixed up for 10 seconds um and then of course there were other other clone you know the other

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:26.360
uh tetranet 2 got closed down by the tetris company just like other ones did um the website

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:32.520
and servers were unavailable for several years as of early 2010 tetranet 2 is back up and running

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:43.000
uh and that's uh i kind of want to play yeah um the tetranet 2 website and servers have been

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:53.400
recovered relocated and restored um this the with all of the you know various versions it was really

01:28:53.400 --> 01:29:01.320
well received especially by the linux community the uh linux conference uh linux.com.au um even

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:07.960
had a programming contest where they tried to uh program tetranet playing bots that would connect

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:13.240
to the server and play the game and the prize for best spot was forty thousand australian

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:22.040
uh was sorry a forty thousand australian dollar ibm p-series server and there's also land parties

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:30.840
um game revolution said tetranet was an affordable alternative to tetris and then in a review in 1999

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:36.280
of the next tetris game revolution said that tetranet was truer to the tetris roots and if

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:41.480
you want multiplayer a multiplayer tetris the network-based tetranet is more fun

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:47.160
i'm wondering if the existence of tetranet is what led to tetris 99

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:54.920
oh i'm i'm sure it's in part inspired by it for sure absolutely yeah you know when they were

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:59.080
trying to think of like how do we do tetris as a battle royale somebody probably thought of

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:04.840
tetranet you know and and you know how could we model it after that in some capacity oh for sure

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:11.800
for sure really care by the way for the way that tetranet 2.0 looks yeah i like the way the first

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:22.120
one looks better yeah but i like the overlaying grid over the pieces so for people who have like

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:29.160
some issues with uh the perception of space and i'm not saying next necessarily depth perception

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:37.560
but just more like spatial awareness having the the segments to the blocks make it easier

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:43.880
and more accessible well we didn't uh in chat they're talking about a vog tetris night and

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:50.040
def says uh tetris 99 has private lobbies you know uh a tetranet or a tetris 99 i think i'd actually

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:55.320
like super be down for that i think that would be a lot of fun uh i think we should invite kevin ddr

01:30:55.320 --> 01:31:00.280
uh from who used to listen to olr years ago to just come and slaughter us all

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:07.640
so if you don't know he's he's uh was quite memorable in the tetra scene for a while so

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:13.720
i don't know if he still plays regularly but yeah that would be very funny all right all right well

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:17.080
there it is uh i think that's all you have to say right that's your classic game of the week

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:22.520
tetranet that'll do it that'll do it but that's that's such a good pick i love i love tetranet

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:26.600
and you're right it's come up on the show i don't know how many times before so uh it only makes

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:32.520
sense we spotlight it as a classic game of the week eventually around these parts right so all

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:39.640
right um anyhow let's wonder why okay my discord was taking forever to kick back in jamie was a

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:45.320
gray square for a minute there all right that's right um a lot a lot of ellos i have more stuff

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:50.840
to do in a row so i'll get right into it are we really okay oh yeah it's rapid fire news hey

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:55.960
when loki's not about to eat myself some rose jelly bellies okay when loki's not here we all

01:31:55.960 --> 01:32:00.280
got to pick up the slack but these are rapid fire news so you can talk about them rapidly well i'll

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:06.840
let you chew that jelly bean and just mention in chat lol lol and dark tissue says idk how badly

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:13.080
do you want to lose um excellent question i'll probably lose anyway i'm not that good at tetris

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:20.040
um you know another tetris game that isn't played online enough is tetris effect it had a pretty

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:23.160
neat multiplayer mode in it i don't know how many of you actually have it we should do a

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:29.640
tetris effect night one night that would be fun i think so all right um i still like giant tetris

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:36.040
which one the giant oh isn't that a sega machine the arcade i think it is yeah that's fun all

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:42.680
right uh let's get anyway rapid fire news star sakura so um i'm sure we've we've covered this

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:41.400

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:46.680
or i'm always uh happy to drop my opinion on whatever you just tagged me over on our discord

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:51.640
server so um dart to see us says i never got around to that one officially i'm assuming that's

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:56.280
the battle toads and double dragon game but playing a bit of the rom it seemed kind of fun

01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:01.880
yeah all right uh we are now going always annoyed the shit out of me so i'm not buying it

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:06.840

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:26.840
zombie army 4 dead war is coming out on the nintendo switch and then we've talked about

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:31.560
this on the show prior the stanley parable the ultra deluxe edition is out pretty much

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:37.160

bug snacks uh makes its debut on the xbox platforms as well as windows and nintendo

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:55.000
switch so bug snacks is no longer a playstation exclusive as of the 28th for you cricket fans

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.960
out there cricket 22 is coming out on the nintendo switch but i'm just i'm just gonna guess

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.680
i don't it's listed in my american release dates although i can't imagine it's actually coming out

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:09.640
in america but that's that's awesome if it does there's a somewhat cricket falling in the us

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:13.640
that's true there's there's people who play rugby here too i know some gay rugby players

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:21.320
they love it rugby is is preferable i think uh then we have rogue legacy 2 i think that game's

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:26.040
been in early access for a little bit but it's coming out of early access for windows xbox uh

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:31.480

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:51.400
uh one that we've had on our our ion for a little bit ever since nintendo kind of surprised announced

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:58.440
this but should it be a surprise should it because this is a we sports was a huge selling game

01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:03.640
nintendo switch sports will have tennis bowling and sword play or chambara is what it's called

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:11.400

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:20.280
you play badminton so enjoy playing with your shuttlecock that is what and if you didn't know

01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:25.320
that is what they call the little thing in bat badminton it's the shuttlecock all right i think

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:30.280
all of us learned that in high school playing badminton all right moving on to japan and

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:36.440
checking out the japanese release dates looking on the nintendo switch uh pretty similar story uh we

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:46.920
have um ike men sengoku toki o kakaru koi aratanaru day uh comes out in regular and limited edition

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:54.520
from idea factory uh and that is uh where you are a fashion designer who goes back in time to

01:37:54.520 --> 01:38:03.240
an alternate version of sengoku era japan you have accidentally changed history and earned the favor

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:09.480
of nobunaga oda by saving him from death so you must survive three months surrounded by famous

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:13.800
and handsome sengoku warlords before your next chance to make it back home

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:22.760
this game sounds too ridiculous to be true but it's true but it's but it's it's notable because

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:30.760
it's you're it's like a men dating simulator you're dating uh sengoku so um that's kind of fun

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:36.600

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:23.880
29th and also in the 29th metal tails overkill all right that that would do it uh we will soon

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:28.440
get to the listener round table your emails your calls and all that good stuff if you want to join

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:35.960
us in our discord for a call vog network.com discord by the way i i have a special need tonight

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:41.160
i'm hoping somebody will call in because i'm gonna need help wrapping up the show tonight

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:45.640
because dark sakura as you know she tends to go out the door before the credits roll because

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:50.200
she's trying to set up for her own little thing uh going on after the show the after party

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:57.960
that's going to leave me here all by my lonesome self so what you're what was you saying i was

01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:03.720
singing that song all by myself by myself yeah so that will leave me all by myself if nobody

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.280
calls in tonight but if we get a phone call tonight i can let that person close down the

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:15.480
show with me tonight so that'll be fun all right um but first intern yeah an intern tonight so

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:20.440
let's uh we do have some stories to get to before we get to the listener round table so let's get to

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:30.920
this uh first story from dark sakura so um uh wisconsin video game workers uh at raven software

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:35.880
um as we know they are the arm of activision blizzard that works on call of duty

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:45.080
um they and i believe that we've talked about raven before in this uh in this whole uh concept

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:50.360
here but they have a unionization campaign by 21 of their employees in middleton wisconsin

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.920
um as just trying to shake more of this up going on i mean they're working you know to really put

01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:06.280
it in there um but at this point um their regional uh nlrb director in minneapolis rejected

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:14.040
um activision's push to have the election encompass a wider category of raven workers

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:23.880
that would dilute the unionizing vote so um at this point um it looks like that the union

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.480
the unionizing may be good to go

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:34.280
so you know we we hypothesize this would probably start at activision and this would be one of the

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:39.160
first to uh break the dam so to speak on the unionization in the game industry efforts and

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:43.480
that might be uh coming to i mean we it's not the first time we've heard of the uni because we've

01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:47.800
had stories on the show weeks before there's been other smaller developers but for this to happen

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:54.840
within activision would be something another thing too earlier this month um activision

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:59.480
blizzard also announced that they would be converting nearly 1100 part-time quality

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:06.440
assurance jobs to full-time jobs and raising hourly wages to at least 20 bucks so there's that

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:12.440
all right and uh if you've gotten if you're getting a raise at your job and you want to

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:18.280
waste your money on something uh boy do i have the prospect for you and that is more legos because

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:27.480
an official lego atari 2600 is supposed to be launching this august um this is by promo bricks

01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:33.640
who kind of leaked this i guess um because uh this you know these things tend to leak out in catalogs

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:40.200
and um you know uh industry ordering and things like that um so an official lego version of the

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:46.920
2600 console uh will be coming back coming out in august as part of the 50th anniversary for

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:53.880
atari as a company uh the set will have a lego rendition of the console itself and also the

01:43:53.880 --> 01:44:00.360
joystick and a cartridge of pitfall which is interesting because that's not an atari game that

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:05.080
was an activision game but that will be the game that will be made from plastic bricks of course

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:11.480
very very similar to the nes system that's out there that you can make a little mario on the tv

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:17.080
that runs it's super cute i don't have one because i was able to hold on to my money but i've seen it

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:22.280
i think bobby blackwolf had one at his house and i was looking at it it's cute um and uh yeah it's

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:28.840
a cute little system so uh that'll uh if the atari 2600 one has the tv and everything too that would

01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:37.800
be pretty cool so uh promo bricks is saying that the atari 2600 will be 200 i'm sorry 199.99 but

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:44.360
let's just say 200 uh when it is a timed exclusive on lego's website this august and a general retail

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:52.200
release in january of 2023 dark to see it says well i guess it would be either that et or pac-man

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:56.120
uh i think atari wants to forget those two

01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:04.200
so it's probably yeah combat would have probably been the game for that oh hey loki's in chat

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:09.560
shouldn't you be lucky shouldn't you be resting loki all right i knew he wouldn't be able to stay

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:15.720
away all night but i was actually gonna say tune in next week to find out when loki plans to get

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:20.920
his because i'm sure he's gonna get uh his own version of that but um i would also expect so so

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:27.080
i also saw in chat uh they're saying that seems kind of cheap it says nothing about the operational

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:32.840
tv with the game on it we know there's a pitfall cartridge that doesn't mean there's a pitfall game

01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:38.280
on the tv so i would imagine that piece of it probably actually isn't there um unless they you

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:45.000
know unless again we're hearing this uh from a second-hand source i imagine when uh atari or

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.240
excuse me lego and atari decide to officially unveil it we'll find out for sure but i wouldn't

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:55.400
count on the tv being a part of it so all right that is it believe it or not for the stories that

01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:59.560
we had on deck for tonight so we're going to get into the listener round table we'll take your

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:07.400
questions uh over at twitch.tv slash vog network but also we welcome your emails every week

01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:12.200
participate at orange lounge radio.com and as i mentioned earlier we will take your calls on the

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:19.000
discord vognetwork.com slash discord i believe we have one email tonight so i will turn it

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:25.080
over emails oh same person snap or i may have not thrown out last week's email check the date

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:30.680
um you know i'm notoriously bad at that yeah yeah sorry last week that was last week's you know i

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:39.480
rely on a clean inbox you are more than welcome to log in before sunday night to take a take a peek

01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:45.960
all right let's get to tonight's email hello lr i was not expecting the reaction that i got

01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:51.320
to my email last week ha as always thank you for your support of my games and i'm including

01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:58.440
the listeners in that as well rob mentioned that unlike with xbox live indie games falling plus is

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:06.040
displayed on the proper xbox store unfortunately this isn't 100 true because although you can

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:11.720
search for it and find it easily you cannot browse the store for it games included in the

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:17.080
creators collection as it is called cannot be browsed you may recall that the store got a

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:23.240
complete visual overhaul back in 2020 this collection had a browsable section on the store

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:28.680
before that but now that is gone several folks have opened tickets or made complaints about this

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:34.520
but unfortunately microsoft is not acknowledging or responding to these oh well i will also mention

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:40.280
that falling plus is unfortunately not a play anywhere title meaning you cannot also play it

01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:47.080
on windows but if um if you buy it on xbox to anyone who would have utilized this i apologize

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:51.080
but it's already available on steam and my audience is small enough that i didn't want

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:57.560
to split it across the two different pc versions but if you post a score to leaderboards on xbox

01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:04.280
email me at yyr at yyrgames.com with your xbox gamer tag and they'll send you a free steam key

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:09.400
that's good guy yyr he doesn't have to do that at all but that's just good guy yyr

01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:15.880
i'll end with a quick correction forza horizon 4 is actually still available on xbox game pass

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:22.120
so if you just discovered forza horizon with the fifth game but would like to try the same game on

01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:28.040
a different map then give it a try while you can i happen to really like the version of the uk that

01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:32.920
they created thanks again for the show and have a great week looking forward to seeing peppy the

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:40.440
penguin again erin yyr all right i'm i'm so glad uh you're happy with the reaction because i was

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:45.880
happy to see it and that's a bummer that there isn't like a store like a way to like look it

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:50.600
up in the store by hand you know a store page kind of like you were explaining there i just assumed

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:55.800
because i could search for it and it had like you you were in the template in the store like you had

01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:00.760
screenshots you had all that other stuff i just kind of assumed oh okay it's in the store because

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:06.360
here it all is but you have to search for it that's interesting um ssj100 matt also notes uh

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:10.520
you can link directly to it because he just dropped the link in our chat room so you can

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:15.720
actually just tap the link and buy it there that way if you want um it's it's too long of a link

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:21.240
for me to read on air so i can't really do it that way um but i can just say search for falling plus

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:28.040
or you can probably search for yyr uh and you'll find it that way too but if for whatever reason

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:32.120
that doesn't work dude just do falling plus and you'll find the game i did play it earlier this

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:39.720
week but i i didn't i was playing for so long i got to a point i had to leave i had to leave and

01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:44.920
i couldn't finish the game and upload my high score i should have just purposely died a bunch

01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:48.680
of times to get my high score up there but i'll do that i'll do that later this week maybe i'll do

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:55.400
a stream who knows but kudos again yyr for the release of falling plus and um my bad on forest

01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:00.120
horizon four i guess it was three they must have delisted not that long ago i'm just getting lost

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:06.440
amongst all those numbers can you blame me i'm not sure all right thank you dark soccer for that

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:11.800
email reading uh participate at orange launch radio.com if you would like to send an email for

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:17.880
a future week in the meantime let's welcome a special guest onto the show because i see

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:22.120
someone in our green room so hello you are you are on orange launch radio who's this

01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:32.200
hey what's going on everyone it is ron well long time no talk i know right you know i had no i

01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:41.480
wasn't planning on calling in until that first article popped up i'm like yeah which article

01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:47.800
oh about about about the person working at nintendo that's oh basically mad they didn't

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:54.920
get flipped to full-time employment what's your thoughts on that well i've been in it

01:50:54.920 --> 01:51:02.760
basically 20 something oh yeah it and contractors oh yes yes and the bulk of that has basically has

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:10.680
been me as a contractor and the main reason you want to go fte is for the benefits and the

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:16.360
discounts and all that cool stuff that's the main reason why but sometimes you'll have to

01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:24.120
be there anywhere from like three days to five years until a position opens up that you can get

01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:31.400
in there or if the budget is big enough where oh they could add another spot for you and that's

01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:37.400
it and contracting specifically is a very interesting world because you get a lot of

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:42.120
temporary people that are brought in for transition work like we're moving from one

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:47.160
cloud to another so we're going to hire contractors that are experts in this to help us with this

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:51.000
transition and then we're going to let them go because they're only they're literally contractors

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.040
they're here for this length of time it does a lot of stuff like that that i i would say is

01:51:56.040 --> 01:52:02.040
nefarious but it's oh it stinks and i'm sure i'm sure nefarious shit happens don't don't get me

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:09.880
wrong yeah it basically depends on the company now i i will put this out there you know i

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:18.200
was a contractor with nbc universal for about a year until covid happened now we had two separate

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:23.480
it departments they merged them so the next open spot went to somebody in the other department

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:28.920
because he had seniority over me and the main reason why i was putting my head down doing what

01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:34.200
i had to do is because i wanted those discounted tickets to universal studios and for the record

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:38.280
i was going to universal studios japan so that was that was my main goal you got to see you

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:42.680
got to see super mario world i don't blame you at all yeah that well yeah that and the sailor moon

01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:48.600
4d uh experience oh shit that's a thing oh my god i want to see i want to take alan alan loves

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:54.520
yeah yeah i i will find you information and i'll send it to you do you know how many bootleg vhs

01:52:54.520 --> 01:53:02.680
sailor moon tapes alan has in his closet i know i had over 150 bootleg vhs tapes until i had to

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:08.520
toss them when i moved believe you me and when i switched to digital a couple terabytes of fan

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:15.880
subs which i slowly deleted as i went to purchase legal titles and stuff like that but i've worked

01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:21.720
for a company called fresh direct where i was a contractor there and i ended up long term because

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:27.800
i knew how to run help desk and do technical support besides loading windows or mac onto

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:33.080
a computer and handing it to the user and what they did was they had a contracting division

01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:38.280
for those for union for the truckers you were contracting with them for x amount of weeks

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:44.680
till you got flipped over to the union where you had all the benefits and so forth and one thing

01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:50.600
that some people don't realize is that when the company when the agency pays you x amount they

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:56.360
charge that company double the amount to have you there which is why nine times out of ten you'll be

01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:03.320
at that same rate for more than one or two years because they'll be like oh we don't have that type

01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:09.720
of money because it's coming out of their bonus and that's why you work hard to show it you can

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:15.320
do so that the manager of this company be like you know what this person's good i like them

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:23.080
let's convert them you know and right now the company i'm currently working with

01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:30.760
i got the call about a month ago saying that my contract is getting converted so i'm basically

01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:36.440
waiting for the hr paperwork and so forth so in a way i do understand where this person is coming

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:44.120
from but sometimes you you've got to you always got to watch your back because even though you

01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:51.000
are still an employee of the company you got to follow the rules and so forth the littlest stuff

01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:58.520
they will ping you for and what's interesting in some cases the littlest stuff they don't they

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:03.480
just let that slide and they expect everybody else to set the proper example you know

01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:11.080
it's uh the contracting world is very interesting stuff and it's it's it's far beyond video games as

01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:16.920
well but it's interesting to see um how video games kind of play into that and how the industry

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:22.920
you know really uses contractors to do um a lot of work that we don't always think about that goes

01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:28.520
into making games i mean it's not even sorry it's not even just like the testing of games and these

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:34.520
are that but like we've talked about trade shows packs right now i don't know what big names are

01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:40.440
still doing packs east right now um but you know when it was you know nintendo and sony that were

01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:46.440
doing these shows the booths that were the people that were staffing the boost contractors yeah

01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:54.360
booth babes i'm using my quotey fingers at e3 in the pat contractors yeah so i mean

01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:02.920
and wait this happens at regular anime conventions too it's like you can be you go to a con and be

01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:08.440
like you can work a booth and get for 20 hours and get reimbursed for your badge and you still

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:12.440
get to go enjoy something like that that happens yeah and the thing is it's like

01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:21.560
like nintendo can sit there and curate all these resumes and go through the whole kit and caboodle

01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:28.840
of the multi-tier interviews to see if they want you or not they'll let the third party company

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:34.120
be like you know what we're gonna call all these people in they're gonna put them through those

01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:38.600
interviews it used to be where the agency will call you back we got your position you report

01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:44.360
here now it's like we have your position you're gonna interview with the agency to see if you are

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:50.520
fit and if they like you you're going to interview with the company and so on and so forth that way

01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:55.080
in the event you do get converted to full-time you've already done those interviews all you

01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:01.640
gotta do is sign the paperwork and that's that um speaking of conventions i know you were somewhere

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:06.200
this weekend because you sent me a picture with another blast from olr's past where were you at

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:13.480
this weekend i was actually in the bronx i went to go visit j j vmont at his job oh you were at

01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:18.680
the store oh i thought you were at a convention okay you were in the actual store oh okay no i'm

01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:23.960
i have a convention this weekend i'm still catching up from the last con uh i i pre-ordered

01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:31.560
a pop from his store because you know even though that same pot was available at game stop i decided

01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:36.440
to cancel that pre-order in order from his comic book shop to support small independent shops good

01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:42.920
for you especially especially his our old friend there so even if i haven't seen him in a while he

01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:47.080
used to call her right once in a while but i i know business has been very busy so i forget

01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:52.200
i went there to pick up a pop and he walked and he he walked away with a hundred extra dollars

01:57:52.200 --> 01:58:01.320
of my money i bought comic book boxes and more pops okay aka shit you don't need you still

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:09.560
walked out of there with it hey look today today was our weekly cost or no actually more

01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:15.480
our every three weeks or so costco trip i have no room to talk about buying extra shit you don't need

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:24.920
look behind my head is a mini is a makeshift shelf that sits on my storage bins of all the

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:31.080
figurines i have purchased that i have not taken out because i realized i don't have room for them

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:38.600
in the display case but they're great deals at cons and it's like well it's within the seven

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:45.880
to ten dollar amazon let me buy this you know i love it uh yeah i'll be filling up this place

01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:52.440
soon enough with that same stuff so yeah i'll say as much about one thing about contracting that i've

01:58:52.440 --> 01:59:00.120
gained from is the fact that every place i've worked at is same yet different i've gained a

01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:07.240
lot of valuable knowledge and training and skill but what sucks is when you're trying to go full

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:12.840
time somewhere they look at your resume and see all these places and it's like well how come you

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:19.000
haven't stayed here how come you're like my contract ended that was it that's all it was

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:24.840
yeah i was up for a role i didn't get it because i had too many contracting positions and in a way

01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:29.000
i'm kind of glad i didn't get that role because i'm happier where i am now that's a weird thing

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:36.280
to dq someone over for sure the person believes that when you're in it you shouldn't have all

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:43.800
these multiple positions these roles i i know multiple people in it where that's the norm

01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:47.960
couldn't you just list your role as the contractor company and the whole time you've been there or

01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:51.320
are you going back and forth between different contractor companies just because i know when

01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:56.040
i was like that by the way well when i was doing contract stuff i was signed up with like three of

01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:59.800
them and i'm like whichever of you hose gets me a job burst is the one i'm sticking with

02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:07.080
i i do that that's exactly what it is yeah i sent my my my resume out next thing you know i'm

02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:14.120
getting all these texts emails and phone calls you know yeah it's for sure i will put it this

02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:22.280
way though when i started with where i am i um i started there with the intention that they would

02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:27.560
hire me because that's just how it works if you really suck you don't you don't stay on

02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:32.920
and i had my first interview for a completely different department and where i work they

02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:38.360
encourage you to wear different hats and diversify yourself and build a bigger portfolio and learn

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:44.360
more and incorporate that into newer and newer newer roles so i know that where i work is also

02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:50.280
a unicorn uh rama i want to get your reaction to this quote in our chat over at twitch.tv

02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:55.080
network quest buster says a co-worker once told me that you can't spell shit without it

02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:04.280
look there is a reason why there is a flask on my desk

02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:11.960
it's regularly have a gimlet lunch break

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:19.880
i i'm glad that they care lunch for us every single day and i'm glad of the fact that the

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:27.720
one block over sells beer okay i love it all right well uh hey rama why don't you hang out

as well do you have a final thought you'd like to share with listeners tonight

02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:32.920
drink more sparkling water because this cherry limeade is the bomb that i i've had that

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:40.840
particular brand and it is good it's good stuff there's like nine cases sitting over here so i'm

02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:45.720
like i'm good for the next like three months i'm not the only one that stocked up at costco clearly

02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:52.040
so all right anyway uh my final thought tonight is you know what i need costco to carry and i've

02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:55.560
already talked about this on a previous episode of the show is this fucking quote coke starlight

02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:01.800
shit that's a zero it's so good i think so some people some people think it tastes like ass i

02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:09.560
think it's delicious and uh it was tasty i kind of felt a taste a hint of caramel while i was

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:13.720
drinking i'm like it's lighter than normal coke this is good it tastes like raspberry to me it

02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:17.640
tastes like specifically this black and red raspberry gummies that's what this tastes like

02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:22.440
to me some people say cotton candy ah yes i don't know and apparently there's a new uh they're doing

02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:26.600
something like pixels i think is you know here i am giving coke free ad dollars but you know what

02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:33.720
here's the downside because i like this because i like this i drew this i'm already not able to

02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:39.400
find the 12 packs anymore and it's just i know it's going to disappear shit i love always goes

02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:46.680
away i feel your pain on that because there are certain flavors of coke and pepsi i cannot get

02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:53.240
here in brooklyn but if i cross the bridge to jersey it's right there but i'm just like i

02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:59.000
don't believe this actually happens this this fictional land of not having to pump my own gas

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:06.120
and finding new flavors of pepsi all right that is it that is going to do it for another episode

02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:10.200
