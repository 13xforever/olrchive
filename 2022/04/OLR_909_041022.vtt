00:00.000 --> 00:13.240
There's been a disturbing trend of businesses and official bodies using temporary statuses

00:13.240 --> 00:16.800
to get around organizational measures despite the strife it causes everyone.

00:16.800 --> 00:20.240
Gig work was not the start of it, but today it is second only to retail as a significant

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
example.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.840
Who else but Activision Blizzard forced the hand of their workers to vote in favor of

00:23.840 --> 00:28.240
their rights, bringing better pay, insurance, benefits to a dearly overworked and underappreciated

00:28.240 --> 00:29.240
group.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.320
With a political wonk intro, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers,

00:32.320 --> 00:34.880
and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.280
Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.660
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:42.660 --> 00:47.680
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.680 --> 00:53.360
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 909 of our

00:53.360 --> 00:57.140
show for this April the 10th of 2022.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.020
My name is Rob Robertson.

00:59.020 --> 01:03.840
I am joined every week here via the magic of the internet and Discord and things like

01:03.840 --> 01:05.640
that with my co-hosts.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.620
Say hello to Zoltar.

01:08.620 --> 01:09.620
No it starts.

01:09.620 --> 01:10.620
I'm not Zoltar.

01:10.620 --> 01:12.180
It's Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:12.180 --> 01:14.220
Hold on, I forgot to turn on my lamps.

01:14.220 --> 01:19.180
But you have that shirt that says Zoltar and it's just, sorry, I can't help it.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.180
So I'm like, is this like the movie big?

01:21.180 --> 01:23.400
Well the shirt actually, hold on.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.400
I like the shirt.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.400
It's a little big.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.080
Oh, it's coin up downtown.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.080
Oh, I see.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.080
I see.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.080
The other voice you hear.

01:34.080 --> 01:38.280
And they got a cease and desist on it and I have one of the last ones you can get.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.960
Oh, that's fun to always get something that's been declared illegal.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.440
The other voice you hear there, of course, Techmaster Loki joining us tonight.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.440
Hi, Loki.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.440
Hello.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.960
I had worms crawling on me, so that was not good.

01:49.960 --> 01:50.960
What?

01:50.960 --> 01:51.960
Gross.

01:52.520 --> 01:57.200
You know, it's the season where the oak worms or whatever those are, like fall from the

01:57.200 --> 01:58.200
trees and stuff.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.200
Oh.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.320
So there was like something earlier, like I felt crawling on me and I like threw it

02:02.320 --> 02:03.320
off.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.320
No thanks.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.320
I didn't see where it went.

02:05.320 --> 02:10.120
My new house does not have a front or a backyard and this is why.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.140
This is exactly what those things are.

02:12.140 --> 02:13.400
We have a giant tree.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.400
I don't know what they are.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.400
They're like, I thought they're called oak worms.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.800
I've never had worms fall out of a tree.

02:17.800 --> 02:21.160
Well, they're less worms and more like caterpillar looking things.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.280
They're like tiny little like green.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.280
They're not.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.280
It's more of a caterpillar.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.280
Like a little grub?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.280
I guess.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.280
Yes.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.280
Or it's got legs.

02:29.280 --> 02:33.560
So, I mean, it's sort of, it's more caterpillar, but like, yeah, they hang from like a little

02:33.560 --> 02:37.800
tiny, it looks like a, a spider web type thing.

02:37.800 --> 02:42.680
They hang down a little string and they swing there in the tree and so they'll drop on you

02:42.680 --> 02:43.680
sometimes.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.680
All right.

02:44.680 --> 02:48.360
Well, let me come back to you in a second, Loki, to talk about worms and not the, you

02:48.360 --> 02:54.480
know, classic PC and PlayStation and a multi-platform game, but Dark Sakura, your shirt, Zoltar, it

02:54.480 --> 02:58.440
makes me think there is actually, this is going to be very random, but I don't care.

02:58.440 --> 03:04.500
There's actually a pokey stop portal, depending on what game you play, called Zoltar that

03:04.500 --> 03:05.500
I saw in Vegas.

03:05.500 --> 03:09.320
And so your shirt made me think of that because you know, those, those machines are kind of

03:09.320 --> 03:11.680
everywhere in the big tourist trap areas.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.680
So cool.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.960
It's fun.

03:13.960 --> 03:14.960
Yeah.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.040
Going back to Loki, I see the game playing behind you tonight because we do tape live

03:20.040 --> 03:25.000
every Sunday night at 9 PM Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv

03:25.000 --> 03:30.160
slash a VOG network, VOG network, right after the Bobby black will show.

03:30.160 --> 03:35.880
And you know, if you, if you watch our videos you can see us, you know, talking and doing

03:35.880 --> 03:38.720
our show, but sometimes we have things going on behind us.

03:38.720 --> 03:43.840
And so Loki has a Sonic the Hedgehog playing and I think hedgehog too.

03:43.840 --> 03:44.840
Okay.

03:44.840 --> 03:51.160
So I'm thinking this must be to do with the movie and knowing that you are a big Jim Carrey

03:51.160 --> 03:56.000
fan, knowing that you have kids that are right around the right age for this, I'm going to

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
guess you went and saw Sonic 2 this weekend.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
And how was it?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
How was it?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I mean, it's great.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I loved it.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I love Jim Carrey.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Was that white parts in the mood?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.480
There's parts of the movie that didn't need to be there.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.160
They were, I don't know who they're supposed to be funny for, I guess adults, but it was

04:12.160 --> 04:16.720
just like, kind of, it's fine, you know?

04:16.720 --> 04:21.960
And funny, one of the characters in there is a character, it's an actor that was in

04:21.960 --> 04:33.200
the show Criminal Minds that my wife has nicknamed Wigglebrows anyways, but it's funny to see

04:33.200 --> 04:36.340
him play a special agent as well in this.

04:36.340 --> 04:37.340
But yeah, it was great.

04:37.340 --> 04:43.540
I think, you know, they really did a good job of capturing, you know, just all the characters

04:43.540 --> 04:44.540
that are in it.

04:44.540 --> 04:50.620
It's a little disappointing to hear that Jim Carrey might not be doing the next movie,

04:50.620 --> 04:54.540
because he's retiring from acting, but we'll see.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.620
If not, they can move with him.

04:56.620 --> 04:59.740
Without getting spoilery, because I don't want to be mean.

04:59.740 --> 05:05.420
There's some people that haven't seen it yet, but I understand there is a post credit sequence

05:05.420 --> 05:10.700
that sets it up so that Jim Carrey doesn't have to be there.

05:10.700 --> 05:11.700
Sort of.

05:11.700 --> 05:12.700
Yeah, yeah.

05:12.700 --> 05:13.700
Yeah.

05:13.700 --> 05:17.020
But there is something that was revealed that is, you know, they could make a movie around

05:17.020 --> 05:18.020
that.

05:18.020 --> 05:20.660
But it's not going to be as exciting for you, because you're just, you're a Jim Carrey fan.

05:20.660 --> 05:23.140
Anyway, it's like Jim Carrey, old video games.

05:23.140 --> 05:24.140
It's a good mix.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.140
Yeah, exactly.

05:25.140 --> 05:28.820
Well, the movie's number one in the box office this weekend, and it did even better than

05:28.820 --> 05:29.820
the first one.

05:29.820 --> 05:33.740
And I have to admit, I'm kind of not surprised, like, I think we're in this era now.

05:33.740 --> 05:39.060
And I think this is why now Nintendo is revisiting the Mario movie concept, right?

05:39.060 --> 05:44.580
Because we all know about the Mario movie in the late 80s that was not good, the one

05:44.580 --> 05:45.580
with Bob Hoskins.

05:45.580 --> 05:49.460
Right, because now you have people that, like, have grown up with video games that are now

05:49.460 --> 05:51.220
directors and producers and stuff.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.220
That's it.

05:52.220 --> 05:54.260
We have the technology for the CG.

05:54.260 --> 05:58.660
And that too, but like, you have people that actually care about the, you know, they grew

05:58.660 --> 05:59.660
up with this stuff.

05:59.660 --> 06:04.580
And now they want to, like, pay tribute to it instead of just like, oh, I'm a director

06:04.580 --> 06:09.500
and I'm going to make a movie because it'll make money because it's a property type of

06:09.500 --> 06:10.500
thing.

06:10.500 --> 06:15.940
I only, only, only ever can think of John Leguizamo in one role.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.380
I that was a CG.

06:17.380 --> 06:23.100
I was going to say in To Wong Foo, I mean, some people might say like spawn or something,

06:23.100 --> 06:24.100
but no.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.040
Little Latin boy, why are you crying?

06:27.040 --> 06:29.040
There's also the very good in spawn.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.400
The Romeo and Juliet movie, which I loved.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.880
I know a lot of people didn't love that Baz Luhrmann Romeo and Juliet I think was an incredibly

06:36.880 --> 06:37.880
underrated movie.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.920
I think that movie is phenomenal.

06:39.920 --> 06:44.800
I think you have to be, well, I think you have to be a certain age.

06:44.800 --> 06:50.560
I think it's one of those, like, it's definitely a Gen X movie, not just Gen X, but like Gen

06:50.560 --> 06:55.840
X, late Gen X, where we are the Oregon Trail, Zillennial, if you will, that whole thing.

06:55.840 --> 06:59.680
I think you have to specifically be in that age range to appreciate that Romeo and Juliet

06:59.680 --> 07:00.680
movie.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.680
I don't know what it is.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.640
I don't know if it's because of who's in it, but, or, or just what it was doing for movies.

07:05.640 --> 07:10.120
Well, speaking of what things are doing for movies, I haven't heard a bad thing about

07:10.120 --> 07:11.120
that.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.880
Everything everywhere all at once that new Michelle Yeoh movie.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.020
I love her.

07:15.020 --> 07:16.760
I absolutely love her.

07:16.760 --> 07:22.120
I think she's one of the best things to happen to Star Trek in however long.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.000
I think she's incredible.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.920
And I'm, I'm happy she's getting to headline a movie and the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis

07:27.920 --> 07:31.320
is in it and they got data to un-retire.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.680
I think that, yeah, so that's the movie I wanted to go see this weekend, but we just

07:34.680 --> 07:35.680
didn't get around to it.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.960
We had some other stuff going, no, no, not, not that data.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.400
I mean data, data from the Goonies, that data Star Trek.

07:42.400 --> 07:50.520
And I was thinking, sorry, no, no, fair, fair, yeah, well, I'm sorry, short round round.

07:50.980 --> 07:56.720
If you want to talk about Picard, let's talk about season three and un-retiring because

07:56.720 --> 08:02.200
they just, they fucking got everybody, everybody, except for Wesley, but you know, but for all

08:02.200 --> 08:08.120
we know, for all we know, he'll have a cameo, but you know, everybody's like, where's X,

08:08.120 --> 08:09.120
where's Y, you know what?

08:09.120 --> 08:12.000
They got the top lines there.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.440
So I mean, if Denise Crosby shows up, that's just a plus at that point in my opinion.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.320
So that's that.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.720
Let's see, SJ 100 Matt in chat talking about the Sonic movie says they released it at the

08:23.720 --> 08:24.880
right time.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.440
Not a lot of big movies come out during Oscar season because they're too busy promoting

08:28.440 --> 08:30.100
previous year's movies.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.760
They came in just after that and the summer blockbusters.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.520
Yeah, I think, and this is similar with games.

08:35.520 --> 08:40.900
I know it's a video game podcast, but I think, I think that concept of like the right time

08:40.900 --> 08:43.780
to release something kind of went out the window.

08:43.780 --> 08:47.360
Like I don't think movies have to come out in the summer or the winter anymore.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.160
And I think like, they just put out a Batman movie a few weeks ago.

08:51.160 --> 08:54.280
Like, you know, there there's movies that do very scream.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.920
The reboot did better, almost better than there.

08:56.920 --> 09:00.300
I don't know how well it did, but I know it did better than scream four.

09:00.300 --> 09:04.320
And that was like, what a January February release, you know, so honestly enough parsing

09:04.320 --> 09:10.560
them out like this, remove some of the competition for people who have to pick and choose what

09:10.560 --> 09:14.800
movies they're going to go see at any given point in time who don't have the disposable

09:14.800 --> 09:19.640
income to go see multiple movies, especially with how expensive it's become.

09:19.640 --> 09:23.880
Tiger Claw on chat says Sonic two made 71 million at the box office more than the first

09:23.880 --> 09:24.880
movie.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.120
Well, I'm not I'm not terribly surprised.

09:26.120 --> 09:33.560
A on the pandemic kind of hobbled the first movie's ability to play more than what one

09:33.560 --> 09:34.560
weekend.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.560
That was just before pandemic.

09:36.560 --> 09:42.040
Well, and I think a lot of people ended up seeing the first movie on demand and all that

09:42.040 --> 09:43.040
stuff.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.040
So I think this is a very interesting.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.600
I mean, I talk about the pandemic like it's over.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.600
It's not.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.800
But we have precautions and vaccinations now.

09:49.800 --> 09:54.880
So more people are willing to go out and do these types of things.

09:54.880 --> 09:59.320
So and with everything you were saying, Matt, I think it's not just the directors and the

09:59.320 --> 10:01.520
filmmakers that are the right age.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.520
But it's the audience.

10:02.520 --> 10:07.400
I mean, you admittedly, you are a perfect example for somebody that loves Sonic growing

10:07.400 --> 10:08.400
up.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.680
And now you have kids.

10:09.680 --> 10:14.040
That's the thing is I never really played the Sonic games too much aside.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.040
Did you have to?

10:15.040 --> 10:16.040
Did you?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.040
You know the basics?

10:17.040 --> 10:21.640
You know, the Green Hill Zone melody, you know, Sonic goes fast, like I would bet that

10:21.640 --> 10:25.680
when it comes to the story and the lore, and this is where I think Sonic three and so on

10:25.680 --> 10:30.880
gets in trouble when you get to the more, I don't want to say B tier characters, but

10:30.880 --> 10:35.720
it is what it well, we've all we've had the OLRN joke for forever about Sonic and all

10:35.720 --> 10:37.080
of his shitty friends, right?

10:37.080 --> 10:46.640
There's a lot of there's a lot of shitty friends that you know, are Yeah, so anyway.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.800
The only reason I would want to see Sonic to though is because knuckles and who voiced

10:50.800 --> 10:51.800
him.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.480
He was knuckles was good.

10:53.480 --> 11:01.640
He was a very good character knuckles I've always been a knuckles fan since since knuckles

11:01.640 --> 11:03.600
came out.

11:03.600 --> 11:09.100
So knuckles was my favorite part of playing a Sonic adventure.

11:09.100 --> 11:13.360
Just as long as we don't get all the ones that came later does not necessary All right.

11:13.360 --> 11:19.160
But I like I like like SPO and some of the chaotic characters Yeah, but like, they're

11:19.160 --> 11:23.200
not going to have that same recognition because you have to know the games to know those types

11:23.200 --> 11:24.200
of characters.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.880
I think when they start getting that deep, it's going to get so difficult.

11:26.880 --> 11:31.800
And I said this last movie, and I'm gonna say it again, because of the end, the end

11:31.800 --> 11:37.720
credit stuff, but like, and this is not spoiler, they do this on both of the movies, they do

11:37.720 --> 11:43.800
like kind of a replay of the movie, but done in the style of the eight big games or 16

11:43.800 --> 11:45.000
big games.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.840
They need to make a Sonic the Hedgehog the movie, like 2d side scrolling game done in

11:50.840 --> 11:53.560
that graphic style, because it's, it's absolutely awesome.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.880
Like it really needs to be a thing.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.240
They need to make a movie.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.960
That's Sonic racing with Danica Patrick starring in it.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.440
She was Oh, yeah, she wasn't.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.440
Yes, she was.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.440
Yes, she was.

12:06.440 --> 12:11.560
Well, that's gonna be the sake multiverse movies when they do one Sonic racing that

12:11.560 --> 12:17.320
I care about that Sonic are and they actually get Lady Miss cure somehow to play ooh, la

12:17.320 --> 12:18.320
la.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.960
I don't care if she's like approaching 60.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.120
At this point, she still needs to play ooh, la la.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.520
It'll be amazing.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.240
Anyway, s2100.

12:25.240 --> 12:29.760
Matt has a great point in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network live on this Sunday night

12:29.760 --> 12:35.600
saying, I will give them props talk about a total reversal, creepy Sonic from the first

12:35.600 --> 12:40.640
movie, redoing Sonic because of it to an actual franchise that's breaking records.

12:40.640 --> 12:45.320
You know what Matt brings up a great point about remember when that first Sonic movie

12:45.320 --> 12:50.040
was in a heap of trouble because of how Sonic looked, and they actually went back and redid

12:50.040 --> 12:52.440
it and now, you know, yeah, good point.

12:52.440 --> 12:58.240
I mean, if they hadn't done that, we probably wouldn't have had this movie make $71 million

12:58.240 --> 13:01.600
because we wouldn't have had it at all if Sonic hadn't hadn't changed from that first

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
one.

13:02.600 --> 13:07.200
So that is is kind of an interesting point how that internet rage against the very first

13:07.200 --> 13:12.640
Sonic trailer, maybe, maybe it's an example of internet rage actually doing some good

13:12.640 --> 13:13.640
in this world.

13:13.640 --> 13:14.640
Who knew?

13:14.640 --> 13:15.640
Who knew?

13:15.640 --> 13:20.800
Although I would pay to see a bad Sonic version of Sonic the movie, you know, just work.

13:20.800 --> 13:25.560
It would be nice to have that cut like that, that extra that Blu ray extra, right?

13:25.560 --> 13:32.520
Like that, like the like the cat butthole cut, you know, I need to see the bad Sonic

13:32.520 --> 13:33.520
cut.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.520
Absolutely.

13:34.520 --> 13:39.040
All right, let's get into some news for the night.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.500
And we're gonna get into the first and I just I just realized you want to hear something

13:42.500 --> 13:43.720
really funny.

13:43.720 --> 13:49.180
I just realized my stream deck is not even plugged in currently, so I can't scroll the

13:49.180 --> 13:50.900
bar on the side.

13:50.900 --> 13:52.380
So please give me a minute.

13:52.380 --> 13:56.220
And we'll get into our first story and pretty soon the bar on the side for those watching

13:56.220 --> 13:57.540
live at Twitch.

13:57.540 --> 13:58.900
We'll catch up.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.300
So let's get into our first story tonight.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.300
Rob.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.300
Yeah.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.800
For the record, Lady Miss Keir has a tumbler.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.180
Who still has a tumbler?

14:09.180 --> 14:10.180
Even the tumbler.

14:10.180 --> 14:13.660
Okay, yeah, I was gonna say, hold on her blog.

14:13.660 --> 14:18.260
Hold up, Lady Miss contrarian because you just talked about your mass affecting tumbler

14:18.260 --> 14:19.620
and how you don't use it anymore.

14:19.620 --> 14:21.580
And you had a lot of people over there.

14:21.580 --> 14:26.180
I'd still exist, but she's got a tumbler.

14:26.180 --> 14:27.180
Interesting.

14:27.180 --> 14:28.180
All right.

14:28.180 --> 14:30.920
Let's move on to our kickoff topic for the night.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.620
And that is about a game.

14:32.620 --> 14:34.380
I don't think it was one of those.

14:34.380 --> 14:35.940
We weren't expecting it this week.

14:35.940 --> 14:36.940
But here it is.

14:36.940 --> 14:37.940
Right, Loki?

14:37.940 --> 14:43.180
Yeah, so we weren't expecting the announcement of Kingdom Hearts four, but that's what we

14:43.180 --> 14:45.100
got a trailer.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.340
And they were doing some 20th anniversary events.

14:48.340 --> 14:52.860
And they wrapped up with the trailer for the new game or I guess sort of an announcement.

14:52.860 --> 14:58.340
And then also an announcement for a game called Kingdom Hearts missing link.

14:58.340 --> 15:04.860
I my main gripe right now with Kingdom Hearts four is that logo is awful.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.560
It's awful because it looks like Kingdom.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.420
It looks like Kingdom Hearts three.

15:09.420 --> 15:10.420
It isn't good.

15:10.420 --> 15:11.420
You're right.

15:11.420 --> 15:16.420
The V look like a V and not just like it looks like Kingdom Hearts three at a glance like

15:16.420 --> 15:22.260
you have to really get in there with a magnifying glass and go Okay, it's for you know, but

15:22.260 --> 15:23.900
it's just, I don't know.

15:23.900 --> 15:30.580
Otherwise the game looks I mean, it looks nice source obviously been like, he's looking

15:30.580 --> 15:32.940
more, you know, for delicate as ever.

15:32.940 --> 15:36.260
I mean, I don't know.

15:36.260 --> 15:39.260
I I'm so far removed from Kingdom Hearts right now.

15:39.260 --> 15:40.900
Like I can't even like,

15:40.900 --> 15:42.340
Okay, get into this.

15:42.340 --> 15:43.340
Mike Deft.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.460
Mike never played it.

15:44.460 --> 15:48.580
Mike Deft brings up a good question, which logo is better?

15:48.580 --> 15:52.780
Street Fighter four or excuse me, Street Fighter six or Kingdom Hearts four?

15:52.780 --> 15:56.380
Because I would say Street Fighter six Kingdom Hearts four for that.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.860
Okay, so there's there's difference.

15:58.860 --> 16:03.060
Street Fighter six, they put no effort into it Kingdom Hearts four they put effort into

16:03.060 --> 16:04.060
it.

16:04.060 --> 16:09.900
But like, the font is just bad that like it's just they they need to make a choice.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.180
It was a choice like choices were made.

16:12.180 --> 16:16.340
The arms of the V are vertical like they are parallel with each other.

16:16.340 --> 16:23.180
It just it's hard to like I get it stylistic but like maybe make it more like a V. That's

16:23.180 --> 16:27.060
my only complaint is such a minor complaint but it's it is weird because I was looking

16:27.060 --> 16:28.060
at the logos.

16:28.060 --> 16:30.980
I'm like, why do you have Kingdom Hearts three on there and then I had to like really look

16:30.980 --> 16:38.980
at my Oh, that's for Okay, well, cool but so some other things so with the new trailer

16:38.980 --> 16:44.300
that they had, they were showing some different kind of scenes that kind of shut off the better

16:44.300 --> 16:49.020
graphics and one of the scenes was like of a creek or something like that.

16:49.020 --> 16:56.020
And we see some metal looking thing that could possibly be like an AT AT or ATS t leg or

16:56.020 --> 16:57.260
foot or something.

16:57.260 --> 17:02.060
So folks are saying well, maybe Star Wars is going to be in there which is very possible

17:02.060 --> 17:06.740
considering that Disney does own all of the properties now Star Star Wars making its way

17:06.740 --> 17:08.160
in there would make a lot of sense.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.080
And I thought I haven't hasn't ever had a discussion about that before when the third

17:11.080 --> 17:14.520
game came out because that was right around the time that Disney was buying Star Wars

17:14.520 --> 17:19.400
and there was like mutual interest around trying to do it again to get Avengers two.

17:19.400 --> 17:24.320
I just want more Tron to be honest so same Yeah, yes.

17:24.320 --> 17:30.120
But we'll see also look even more amazing now with all the Yeah, yeah, current gen graphics

17:30.120 --> 17:35.080
deaf to saying Simpsons world and Kingdom Hearts for although that's still all the Disney

17:35.080 --> 17:38.240
own Fox now what doesn't Disney Oh, they do own Jesus.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.240
We have X.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.240
Oh, that's right.

17:40.240 --> 17:48.040
Because Frank inverters world, but then I want my Rocky horror picture show world Transylvania

17:48.040 --> 17:49.400
we need it.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.500
So who I mean, literally anything and everything can be in there.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.480
But it looks like judging for the trailer.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.320
It's more of a and I think the gag would be that it's the real world.

17:57.320 --> 18:00.480
And that maybe it's real world locations.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.240
And that could be very interesting as well.

18:02.240 --> 18:06.280
I think also surprising for a lot of people with the trailer I know it was for me is that

18:06.280 --> 18:10.400
there's gameplay in it or hypothetical gameplay.

18:10.400 --> 18:14.800
One could argue that we're looking at target render with that, that maybe it doesn't actually

18:14.800 --> 18:15.800
look like that.

18:15.800 --> 18:22.220
Yeah, but still, you get the sense that there is, you know, gameplay, you know, you're looking

18:22.220 --> 18:23.220
at it.

18:23.220 --> 18:26.760
And and the reason why I say it's surprising is because I think most people expected when

18:26.760 --> 18:32.960
they announced Kingdom Hearts for it'll have Sora Donald goofy fade in, fade out logo,

18:32.960 --> 18:36.160
some cryptic thing that doesn't make sense because the story doesn't make sense those

18:36.160 --> 18:37.440
games anyway.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.440
And then that's it.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.440
We'll see the game in 25 years.

18:41.440 --> 18:44.980
And that's, that's, that's where we figured that but now it's like, oh, it's maybe they

18:44.980 --> 18:47.480
actually have something playable in there.

18:47.480 --> 18:51.480
Wow, okay, maybe we will be seeing this thing a little bit sooner.

18:51.480 --> 18:54.520
Because everybody's been joking about how it's going to be, you know, 50 years before

18:54.520 --> 18:57.660
even I wrote that tweet where I'm like, I can't wait to play it in heaven because I'll

18:57.660 --> 18:59.720
be dead before this thing comes out.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.080
But some folks are saying you know what, maybe it's not going to be so bad.

19:03.080 --> 19:09.480
I guess I guess from Kingdom Hearts three announcement to game arrival was only six

19:09.480 --> 19:10.960
years.

19:10.960 --> 19:15.660
Only just just to put it in perspective.

19:15.660 --> 19:21.920
If this game comes out in only six years, we'll, we'll, we'll be 50 or damn close to

19:21.920 --> 19:22.920
it.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.640
Getting to play this game.

19:24.640 --> 19:31.720
As soon as I mean, considering that they said they celebrated their 20th anniversary, and

19:31.720 --> 19:35.880
there's only three games out well three, you know, there's more than three there's a start

19:35.880 --> 19:41.320
to see a points out it's the 16th game in the timeline, there's more than three.

19:41.320 --> 19:46.200
It's just the third mainline game, you're forgetting all the line of all that she could

19:46.200 --> 19:50.160
one that I am not going to try to explain on this three hour podcast, because three

19:50.160 --> 19:53.680
hours isn't enough time to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.040
It's just not to go along with all that.

19:57.040 --> 20:02.240
So because Kingdom Hearts four was, I guess, announced and everything there, folks are

20:02.240 --> 20:07.320
saying that the GeForce now link or leak that had Kingdom Hearts four I guess as part of

20:07.320 --> 20:10.960
that is expected to maybe be true.

20:10.960 --> 20:15.600
I don't know though Kingdom Hearts four seems kind of like an easy guess that there's going

20:15.600 --> 20:19.400
to be a Kingdom Hearts four I mean,

20:19.400 --> 20:26.280
it is but I guess you know what wasn't as easy of a guest was Chrono Cross getting remastered.

20:26.280 --> 20:30.000
And it's kind of like it's all happening around the same time.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.800
And I think that's what's lending itself to this.

20:31.800 --> 20:32.800
But here's the thing.

20:32.800 --> 20:38.360
Okay, so they talk about a Final Fantasy nine remake, and I feel like everybody's brain

20:38.360 --> 20:41.640
is going to what they did with Final Fantasy seven remake.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.880
And I'm like, hold your horses, people.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.440
Hold your horses.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.780
Because who's to say the Final Fantasy nine remake isn't going to look like the Final

20:49.780 --> 20:53.100
Fantasy eight remaster or whatever it is they did recently.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.240
And that is it's kind of garbage.

20:55.240 --> 20:59.840
Like I'm sorry, and that isn't me trying to dig on the game because you all know, I don't

20:59.840 --> 21:03.320
care for the gameplay and Final Fantasy eight, the plot is fine.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.640
I don't care for the gameplay.

21:05.640 --> 21:09.640
But I mean, playing it on because it was on Xbox Game Pass not that long ago, it looked

21:09.640 --> 21:15.200
like duty kaka because you had these like new sprites on blurred backgrounds.

21:15.200 --> 21:19.000
It just it was really not a good look.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.280
And I'm understanding again, I don't want to pick a fresh wound.

21:23.280 --> 21:27.960
But a lot of the feedback I'm hearing on Chrono Cross is that it's in a similar place.

21:27.960 --> 21:33.800
So I worry the Final Fantasy nine is going to be ending up this direction as well, in

21:33.800 --> 21:36.760
which case hard pass.

21:36.760 --> 21:41.600
It doesn't look like it's worth the restoration to be honest.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.800
So I didn't even play it the first time.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.120
Oh, Final Fantasy nine.

21:45.120 --> 21:48.280
Yeah, I started it and it was so boring.

21:48.280 --> 21:53.240
It like I think the game plays better than eight, but y'all know how I feel about eight,

21:53.240 --> 21:55.000
but I do have a better story.

21:55.000 --> 22:02.040
I do agree that the plot for nine is it just doesn't hold up in your memory as well as

22:02.040 --> 22:06.640
almost any of the other games in the franchise save for maybe like two and 15.

22:06.640 --> 22:09.080
I didn't care about the story in nine.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.080
Exactly.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.160
I didn't care about the characters.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.160
They were not engaging.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.160
Yeah.

22:13.520 --> 22:14.520
I kind of agree with you on that.

22:14.520 --> 22:17.480
And I that was one of the games I did pick that up right at launch too.

22:17.480 --> 22:23.640
And I remember playing it going, Oh, I was expecting more seven and eight.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.240
This is all right, I guess.

22:25.240 --> 22:29.160
But now Final Fantasy nine could also be a middle ground.

22:29.160 --> 22:35.640
And I would say that's the live a live route where they're using the engine for triangle

22:35.640 --> 22:38.040
strategy and Octopath Traveler and all that.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.680
I think that would be great.

22:39.680 --> 22:42.200
However, my I want to see that was six.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.040
Well, I need to see that was six or four.

22:44.040 --> 22:48.120
My only concern with that is that live alive was a Super Nintendo game.

22:48.120 --> 22:52.760
And that engine looks to be a little better at adapting Super Nintendo stuff.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.480
But I'm also not a programmer.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.880
So I don't want to sit here and say it's easier or harder.

22:59.880 --> 23:04.520
I just if Final Fantasy nine were to look like that live live reboot, I think that would

23:04.520 --> 23:06.360
do a lot more justice.

23:06.360 --> 23:11.480
But I also agree with what you're saying, Loki, is that I would far more want to see

23:11.480 --> 23:15.160
four or five and six all done in that engine first.

23:15.160 --> 23:21.320
And honestly, and this may shock you, I would love to see Chrono Trigger in that engine

23:21.320 --> 23:21.720
as well.

23:22.360 --> 23:26.520
So I hope that live alive does very well for them.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.640
And they are convinced to put more of the Super Nintendo catalog in there.

23:30.280 --> 23:35.000
And then there's Oh, gosh, there's also those rumors about Enix titles that were under consideration

23:35.000 --> 23:35.880
at one point.

23:35.880 --> 23:41.240
Do you know, I, I will put out for the quintet trilogy to come back.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.440
Brain Lord and Terran.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.400
I will put out like, show me who I have to put it.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.520
I will do it.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.840
I will do and you're welcome next.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.640
It's, it's such a good trilogy.

23:52.680 --> 23:53.960
And I would love those.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.960
Those games really need to come back.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.920
I mean, like Final Fantasy six, Final Fantasy four.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.200
I love those games.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.240
They literally just got re released.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.920
You know, whether, whether you cared for the re release or not, they literally just

24:06.920 --> 24:07.960
got re released.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.920
So we probably don't need to revisit those games again for five years.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.400
Gaia, Terranigma.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.320
Those games have never been touched since the Super Nintendo days.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.280
Never been touched.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.560
So I think those games are due.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.960
So fingers and toes crossed, to be honest.

24:25.960 --> 24:26.600
S2 100.

24:26.600 --> 24:31.080
Matt in chat says, I feel like Final Fantasy nine came out at the end of the PlayStation

24:31.080 --> 24:35.480
one life cycle, which at that point I moved on to Dreamcast and other stuff.

24:35.480 --> 24:36.520
Well, that's a lot of the problem.

24:36.520 --> 24:41.080
Final Fantasy 12 faced is it came out at the end of the PlayStation two life cycle.

24:41.720 --> 24:45.320
Not every PlayStation three could play PlayStation two stuff.

24:45.320 --> 24:48.280
And a lot of people were going to Xbox 360 at that point.

24:49.240 --> 24:51.880
So a lot of people miss Final Fantasy 12.

24:51.880 --> 24:57.400
So 12 really didn't get its due until the, the remaster they did recently.

24:57.400 --> 25:02.200
And, you know, honestly, a lot of the work that the team did on Final Fantasy 14, because

25:02.200 --> 25:05.960
it's the same business unit within Square Enix that did 12.

25:05.960 --> 25:10.360
I don't think it's technically the same business, but a lot of the same people that did 12 did

25:10.360 --> 25:11.080
14.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.840
And there's a lot with that.

25:12.840 --> 25:22.680
So anyway, so the earlier Nvidia leak, honestly, it's probably it's true.

25:22.680 --> 25:26.600
Let's just let it's true, but I'm more excited for the tactics.

25:27.640 --> 25:27.960
Now.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.680
Now there's, there's a game for live, alive.

25:30.680 --> 25:34.920
I was like, there's the game that, and that it's, it's sure.

25:34.920 --> 25:35.240
Okay.

25:35.240 --> 25:40.040
We, we had advance on, um, the Game Boy advance.

25:40.040 --> 25:40.540
You know what?

25:41.560 --> 25:42.520
Final Fantasy Tactics.

25:42.520 --> 25:43.020
It's time.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.600
Let's, let's, let's do that one in the live, alive engine.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.120
I'd be very happy about that.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.200
I don't even like tactical games.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.640
That one I really like.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.960
So there's that.

25:53.960 --> 25:54.460
All right.

25:55.100 --> 25:59.100
Let's talk about other things we like in our gaming week with a segment that we call.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.140
How was your gaming week?

26:00.140 --> 26:03.260
Where we talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

26:03.260 --> 26:03.900
Dark soccer.

26:03.900 --> 26:04.540
I'll start with you.

26:05.980 --> 26:10.300
Um, I'm playing, uh, taking density three.

26:10.300 --> 26:13.820
Uh, I should be done with it soon.

26:13.820 --> 26:14.620
Come to think of it.

26:15.340 --> 26:16.700
Um, I just got flammie.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.380
I was so excited to get flammie.

26:18.380 --> 26:21.820
I peeked at your stream last night for a hot minute and I could tell you're close to the

26:21.820 --> 26:22.320
end.

26:23.020 --> 26:23.520
Yeah.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.760
Um, I, uh, word.

26:28.960 --> 26:36.400
I'm also playing, um, dead by daylight and I actually had like the most amazing round

26:36.400 --> 26:41.760
of pig games and then I played somebody else and it was kind of crap, but all my pig games

26:41.760 --> 26:42.640
were great.

26:42.640 --> 26:47.040
And then I made friends in one of my last pig games cause it turned into a boop match.

26:47.040 --> 26:53.440
And if anyone doesn't know what boop in the snoot is, go look it up.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.280
Cause I had many, many snoot boops.

26:58.480 --> 27:01.120
Um, and I made friends with, with like the entire party.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.400
So it was pretty great.

27:02.400 --> 27:08.960
Um, other than that, I've just been prepping stuff up for my birthday marathon on Thursday

27:09.760 --> 27:14.880
and you know, just trying to think of welts I'm going to be playing as I am going to do

27:15.360 --> 27:16.320
Terranigma next.

27:17.600 --> 27:21.200
And I've just been getting things prepped up for that and need to go find sprites to

27:21.200 --> 27:22.560
do my chat windows and whatnot.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.060
But yeah.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.720
Well, good luck with the, uh, birthday marathon on Thursday.

27:26.720 --> 27:30.160
So, uh, if I can stay awake, I can barely keep my eyes open now.

27:31.040 --> 27:34.400
Hope you get cake or whatever it is you desire.

27:34.400 --> 27:34.880
I bought myself a cake.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.680
Uh, what kind of cake?

27:37.680 --> 27:38.640
A little chocolate torte.

27:39.680 --> 27:40.180
Yummy.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.240
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

27:43.120 --> 27:44.560
Uh, mostly Minecraft.

27:44.880 --> 27:51.760
As usual, I've been just working on prepping stuff for future episodes and all that.

27:51.760 --> 27:57.600
Uh, I don't remember this week was look at the calendar here.

27:57.600 --> 28:00.080
I think I did some of the April fool's stuff this week.

28:00.080 --> 28:00.400
Yeah.

28:00.400 --> 28:04.400
Cause we, we had our, I did a late roll fools stuff.

28:04.400 --> 28:09.120
So I was pulling pranks, I guess, on our server, um, doing different things with that.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.200
So I put out a video about that and that was fun.

28:11.760 --> 28:16.640
Uh, I did play something else other than just Minecraft.

28:16.640 --> 28:21.200
I checked out cause I saw another YouTuber playing it, uh, Ali 43.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.920
There was this game called instruments of destruction.

28:23.920 --> 28:28.880
It's kind of like, um, Oh God, I don't even remember the original game now.

28:28.880 --> 28:35.440
Um, it's basically a game where you build machines that can break stuff and then you

28:35.440 --> 28:39.920
drive them through these islands and you break stuff with them.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.840
So it's all physics based.

28:41.840 --> 28:47.360
Um, you've got like a saw blades and stuff you can put on your machines, wrecking balls

28:47.360 --> 28:48.960
and all sorts of things in it.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.320
Everything breaks really nice.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.320
There's lots of physics involved with everything.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.920
So it just looks really cool.

28:53.920 --> 28:57.280
So I checked it out and it's all right.

28:57.280 --> 29:01.840
It, it, I don't know if I play it for a long time, but it's, it's okay.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.680
I'm really now I'm kind of bothered cause I don't remember what that other game I'm

29:05.680 --> 29:06.960
thinking of was.

29:07.040 --> 29:11.200
There was another one though, similar kind of style where you didn't really like the

29:11.200 --> 29:16.800
break things you had to like defeat an army of like, it's like a medieval thing.

29:16.800 --> 29:20.480
I don't remember his call though, but, um, both fun.

29:20.480 --> 29:23.840
So yeah, check it out if you like that kind of, you know, physics based stuff.

29:23.840 --> 29:27.120
It's still an early access, but it's only like 20 bucks.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.080
So it's not bad.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.560
Uh, that's it.

29:30.560 --> 29:34.320
I didn't get to play as any DDR this week because it was a little warm.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.000
It was like, we're almost 90.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.040
So the garage, right?

29:38.800 --> 29:40.800
Uh, this week should be a little bit better than this.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.200
Hopefully I'll get into a little bit of that.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.880
It's supposed to be in the sixties tomorrow.

29:45.440 --> 29:45.760
Yeah.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.680
And for like the early part of the week too.

29:47.680 --> 29:51.040
So looking forward to that, what's that game?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I don't know why I'm going through my steam library.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.040
Like, Oh, there it is.

29:55.040 --> 29:58.560
Like I'm going to find it amongst all these like 700 games that are in here.

29:58.560 --> 30:02.320
But, um, yeah, that was, it's a fun game.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.360
Just check it out though.

30:03.360 --> 30:03.860
Right.

30:04.420 --> 30:09.300
Uh, my gaming week, um, I have a confession to make.

30:10.020 --> 30:12.020
This is, this is hard.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.060
Okay.

30:15.060 --> 30:20.260
Um, this week I, I played Fortnite.

30:23.940 --> 30:26.260
I don't know why I, I've seen a lot.

30:26.260 --> 30:26.820
Okay.

30:26.820 --> 30:28.500
I can try Roblox next.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.060
I've seen a lot of, a lot of my friends play Fortnite.

30:31.300 --> 30:35.220
I've seen a lot of, like, it seems to be having this weird resurgence on Twitch lately.

30:35.220 --> 30:36.660
Well, it's actually, no, it's not weird.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.260
I'm telling you what the secret sauce is.

30:38.260 --> 30:42.660
It's the no build mode is that now everybody is like, Oh, Fortnite's interesting again.

30:42.660 --> 30:47.300
Which is funny because you know, a lot of the Fortnite faithful were like, Oh, they're

30:47.300 --> 30:50.580
going to add this mode that just makes it generically like every other shooter.

30:50.580 --> 30:52.260
And that's going to make the game more interesting.

30:53.380 --> 31:00.100
Yeah, yeah, it is actually because the building thing put a lot of people off and yeah, the

31:00.100 --> 31:02.500
fact that now it's just like every other shooter.

31:02.500 --> 31:09.540
So it's easier to get into, but it's every other shooter with Ariana Grande, the Marvel

31:09.540 --> 31:15.700
cinematic universe, Assassin's Creed characters, the kitchen sink, whatever else they're throwing

31:15.700 --> 31:16.660
at this game.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.340
It actually makes it kind of interesting.

31:18.340 --> 31:20.900
So, um, yeah, I've been playing a little bit of Fortnite.

31:20.900 --> 31:24.820
Actually, it's the creative mode for me and it's, it's interesting.

31:25.620 --> 31:29.460
I give Epic games a lot of shit and rightfully so let's be clear.

31:30.820 --> 31:34.660
Tim Sweeney is kind of an asshole on social media.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.380
Like I'm just I'm just he's kind of an asshole on social media.

31:38.100 --> 31:42.260
But I can't ignore that he created ZZT, right?

31:42.260 --> 31:48.660
Which which is a retro game that a lot of us hold in high fucking regard, right is ZZT.

31:49.620 --> 31:55.540
And it's interesting because when I play creative mode in Fortnite, I see those little glimpses

31:55.540 --> 31:56.260
of ZZT.

31:57.380 --> 32:04.020
Like, and I kind of go, I see, I see how we got from that to this.

32:04.900 --> 32:08.580
Not that I'm saying Fortnite's as good as ZZT, nothing's ever going to live up to those

32:08.580 --> 32:09.780
memories from those days.

32:09.780 --> 32:14.580
But I see how we got from that to this.

32:14.580 --> 32:15.860
And I think it's kind of interesting.

32:15.860 --> 32:16.260
I don't know.

32:16.820 --> 32:23.140
So there's been that I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14 because there's finally the

32:23.140 --> 32:27.220
new patch, the first Endwalker patch is out on Tuesday.

32:27.220 --> 32:31.780
And I'm really hyped for it because we really don't know where the story is going next.

32:32.980 --> 32:37.300
You know, because they wrapped everything up at the end of the patch 6.0.

32:38.980 --> 32:43.380
I've also really enjoyed in the past couple weeks, I really like to watch reaction videos

32:43.380 --> 32:46.020
to a few of the big cutscenes towards the end of Endwalker.

32:46.740 --> 32:49.860
I won't repeat because I know not everybody here has played it.

32:49.860 --> 32:53.860
But there's some very key cutscenes towards the end of the game and watching people's

32:53.860 --> 32:57.380
reaction to them just they get very sad.

32:57.380 --> 32:58.660
And then I get very sad.

32:58.660 --> 33:01.140
And it's this very interesting sort of therapy thing.

33:01.140 --> 33:05.940
So I'm really excited for some news story and to see what we can react to next in that

33:05.940 --> 33:12.340
game because they really did kind of close up most of the loose ends at the end of Endwalker.

33:13.220 --> 33:15.380
So be curious to see where they go next.

33:15.380 --> 33:21.700
So Zen Monkey 11 in chat says, Wait a minute, this is the first time I'm hearing this, they

33:21.700 --> 33:22.980
remove the building in the game?

33:22.980 --> 33:24.340
Or is it just a new mode?

33:24.340 --> 33:25.860
If they remove the building, that's done.

33:25.860 --> 33:27.140
That was the main thing I liked about it.

33:27.140 --> 33:28.020
It is a new mode.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.540
So when you go to select like, do you want to play squad?

33:31.540 --> 33:32.420
Do you want to play?

33:32.420 --> 33:36.100
You can also play zero build is a new mode they put in it.

33:36.100 --> 33:38.260
And there's a lot of people that are into that.

33:38.260 --> 33:40.500
So yeah, it's just a new mode.

33:40.500 --> 33:44.500
So if you if you're a building loyalist, then you still have your thing.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.540
Don't worry about it.

33:45.540 --> 33:51.860
I think for a temporary amount of time, zero build was the only way to play but that's

33:51.860 --> 33:52.420
that's done.

33:52.980 --> 33:54.740
So that's that on Fortnite.

33:56.900 --> 34:01.060
Fifth Dream says I want to come back to Final Fantasy 14 when more stuff is soloable in

34:01.060 --> 34:01.860
future patches.

34:01.860 --> 34:07.460
Well, that's one of the big things about this patch they're putting out is that I believe

34:08.100 --> 34:12.100
the entirety of a realm reborn is now soloable.

34:12.580 --> 34:16.340
So all of those dungeons they've remade to be trust dungeons.

34:16.340 --> 34:24.500
They are completely redoing the end game story dungeons, the Praetorium and Castrum meridian

34:24.500 --> 34:27.380
are now four player not eight player and you can run them with trust.

34:27.940 --> 34:31.060
So yeah, so they're there.

34:31.700 --> 34:35.300
Realm Reborn I think is going to be 100% soloable.

34:35.300 --> 34:41.460
I might be wrong in that you might have to do a couple of fights still in a party but

34:41.460 --> 34:42.500
it should be very minimal.

34:43.300 --> 34:45.140
So I think it's interesting.

34:45.140 --> 34:48.420
And that's the part that's free to play too, which is even more interesting.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.860
So I think they let the free to play players back in.

34:51.860 --> 34:52.420
Yes, they did.

34:52.420 --> 34:52.920
They did.

34:53.380 --> 34:57.060
So otherwise, I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight.

34:57.060 --> 35:01.060
I was giggling when Dark Soccer was talking about the pig boops that she was giving out

35:01.060 --> 35:02.660
because I booped a pig.

35:02.660 --> 35:07.380
That was the first time that I had a pig and not try to kill me and I was able to sneak

35:07.380 --> 35:09.700
up and go boop on the snoot and then run out the door.

35:09.700 --> 35:10.900
Did you boop a pig and you liked it?

35:10.900 --> 35:11.220
I did.

35:11.220 --> 35:14.100
I did boop the pig and they could have killed me.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.380
They actually knocked me out.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.300
Oh, I know why they were mad.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.940
They couldn't find me the entire match.

35:21.940 --> 35:26.100
The other three died and finally this pig finds me.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.340
I'm really good at hiding and being immersed.

35:30.500 --> 35:35.620
The pig knocked me out just because they wanted to put a party hat on me, which if you've

35:35.620 --> 35:37.700
seen the movie Saw, you know what the party hats are.

35:38.340 --> 35:39.780
They're not party hats.

35:39.780 --> 35:41.940
Actually, it was only ever on one character.

35:41.940 --> 35:46.420
I think it was in the first movie and it was on Amanda.

35:46.420 --> 35:47.380
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

35:47.380 --> 35:48.340
They use their trap.

35:48.340 --> 35:49.780
They use it again later for sure.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.140
I don't want to spoil, but I didn't watch.

35:51.140 --> 35:54.020
I didn't care about any of this, but I think they only used it like one other time.

35:55.700 --> 35:57.700
At least twice that I know of in the canon.

35:57.700 --> 36:03.060
It wasn't like I don't think people who don't play Dead by Daylight are going to understand

36:03.060 --> 36:04.260
what the party hat is.

36:04.260 --> 36:04.980
Oh, yeah.

36:04.980 --> 36:07.060
So it's the reverse bear trap thing.

36:07.060 --> 36:14.500
So anyway, my point is the pig put that thing on and then allowed me to get out and crawl

36:14.500 --> 36:15.620
out or whatever.

36:15.620 --> 36:18.980
And then I was able to boop the snoot and run out, which I forgot.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.740
I didn't know you could leave the party hat on.

36:20.740 --> 36:23.380
I thought you couldn't, but I guess you can after all the gens are done.

36:23.380 --> 36:28.740
Yeah, if you get the hat on after the gens are done, you can safely leave or you can

36:28.740 --> 36:30.500
leave the hatch with it.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.180
Okay, that's why.

36:32.180 --> 36:38.020
Which is why, like, the only time I'll ever do it after after gens are done is just for

36:38.020 --> 36:38.740
blood points.

36:38.740 --> 36:39.540
Got it.

36:39.540 --> 36:40.040
Okay.

36:40.980 --> 36:42.500
And that was really it for my gaming week.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.780
I really have a lot else.

36:43.780 --> 36:49.540
So let's get into some gaming news and talk about what is going on around the industry.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.460
And we will start with Loki.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.580
That game I was thinking of, by the way, was Besiege.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.620
That was that was very similar.

36:57.620 --> 36:58.120
Okay.

36:58.680 --> 37:04.840
Anyways, so here's some good news about Activision Blizzard for change.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.240
We're in, you know, backwards world now.

37:08.520 --> 37:12.440
Apparently 1100 workers are going to be moved to full time roles.

37:12.440 --> 37:15.400
This is their US based QA workers.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.640
They are no longer going to be contract employees.

37:17.640 --> 37:21.880
They're going to be full time employees with benefits starting July 1st.

37:21.880 --> 37:32.920
I'm thinking this is to try to quell additional unions, but good, I guess, because I know

37:32.920 --> 37:39.880
the QA workers on as part of Raven had, I believe, try the former union as a big strike.

37:39.880 --> 37:46.520
And then, yeah, so but at least you know that the QA employees are going to be moved to

37:46.520 --> 37:47.080
full time.

37:47.080 --> 37:52.280
They're going to be paid 20 or at minimum, I guess, $20 an hour.

37:53.400 --> 37:53.800
Good.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.640
Seems kind of low for QA work, but okay.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.000
But once again, I think it's just throwing them a bone.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.720
I say good because the fact that they're setting that means that doesn't exist now.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.120
So it's coming up.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.640
They're being paid even less.

38:09.640 --> 38:15.640
But on top of all that, though, like probably with a union, you could have got more.

38:15.640 --> 38:19.080
But yeah, something is better than nothing.

38:20.600 --> 38:23.400
Well, and it's also nice to see the benefits.

38:23.400 --> 38:28.840
It's nice to see that a lot of the action that the employees have worked hard with the

38:28.840 --> 38:33.560
organization efforts that they have done thus far have resulted in meaningful change.

38:34.440 --> 38:39.960
Some may argue how meaningful this is, but it is change in the direction that people

38:39.960 --> 38:40.680
wanted to see it.

38:40.680 --> 38:46.200
And let's be honest, we would not be talking about this whatsoever right now if employees

38:46.200 --> 38:49.320
hadn't taken the first steps to ask for that or to demand that change.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.520
So it's just still unionized, though, on top of that.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.080
Oh, of course.

38:53.800 --> 38:58.680
But you're right that a lot of these things are probably in an effort to prevent that

38:58.680 --> 38:59.720
from happening, I guess.

38:59.720 --> 39:07.640
But anyhow, let's move on and talk about PlayStation Plus, which I believe we talked

39:07.640 --> 39:11.560
a little bit about last week about how it is confirmed there's going to be that whole

39:11.560 --> 39:13.640
three tier system for PlayStation Plus.

39:14.280 --> 39:19.080
It's basically a lot of PlayStation now that already exists, but now with a lot of retro

39:19.080 --> 39:20.680
game, a lot more retro games.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.960
And a lot of people are wondering what type of retro games.

39:25.000 --> 39:30.440
Well, on the official PlayStation podcast this week, Jim Ryan, the boss of PlayStation,

39:30.440 --> 39:35.880
was a guest, as you would expect on the official PlayStation podcast from time to time, and

39:35.880 --> 39:40.760
said that subscribers can look forward to, here's the quote, all the big names.

39:42.280 --> 39:47.880
So when a question was asked, the reply, quote, massive publisher participation.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.040
We have all the big names present.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.480
We have big publishers.

39:51.480 --> 39:53.240
We have small indie publishers.

39:53.240 --> 39:57.960
We have over 200 partners working with us to put their content into PlayStation Plus.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.960
So the lineup is going to be really strong.

40:00.200 --> 40:07.720
Now, here's the thing, if they're even missing one game, we know the internet people, we

40:07.720 --> 40:11.960
know social media people, they are going to fixate on that one game.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.120
I know this internet.

40:14.120 --> 40:17.480
I've been around this internet for a long time, y'all.

40:18.440 --> 40:21.320
And it'll be interesting to see all those Activision games in there.

40:22.280 --> 40:26.600
The internet will absolutely fixate on what games are missing.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.000
Or are they going to be in there?

40:29.960 --> 40:32.600
Oh, Activision?

40:32.600 --> 40:33.640
I would assume so.

40:34.280 --> 40:35.000
I would assume so.

40:35.000 --> 40:35.080
Sure.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.600
Because games pass.

40:36.600 --> 40:41.480
I would think that'd make it look much more, they'll be on their platform, but maybe not

40:41.480 --> 40:42.680
necessarily part of Plus.

40:46.680 --> 40:47.640
I think it'll be there.

40:48.520 --> 40:53.800
Because it's still some money and it's better than no money, which is what those games are

40:53.800 --> 40:54.920
otherwise making.

40:54.920 --> 41:02.280
So, but of course, it also is kind of confirmed those games will, or PlayStation Plus, the

41:02.280 --> 41:06.280
new version is not going to be first party launches.

41:06.280 --> 41:11.400
So whereas Xbox Game Pass has Starfield, Halo Infinite coming out day one, don't expect

41:11.400 --> 41:14.360
God of War Ragnarok to come out on PlayStation Plus.

41:15.160 --> 41:20.920
In the interview, Jim Ryan said, the games that we make are getting bigger.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.120
They're getting better.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.560
They're getting more beautiful.

41:23.560 --> 41:24.680
They're getting richer.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.520
The narrative is getting stronger.

41:26.520 --> 41:31.400
Putting these games into a subscription service immediately upon their release would break

41:31.400 --> 41:32.840
this virtuous circle.

41:32.840 --> 41:36.120
And we wouldn't be able to invest in the way that we're currently able to.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.480
So we're not doing it.

41:37.480 --> 41:41.400
We're going to stick to the approach that we have and has served us well under many

41:41.400 --> 41:41.960
years now.

41:42.840 --> 41:47.240
And by they're getting richer, they mean Sony's getting richer because of their $70

41:47.240 --> 41:53.160
price point and, you know, games, you know, different season passes and microtransactions

41:53.160 --> 41:56.840
and that kind of stuff that they have to walk back later on after it becomes really

41:56.840 --> 41:57.320
terrible.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.040
You said it with microtransactions, because here's the thing.

42:00.040 --> 42:08.120
If this, well, if these games like God of War Ragnarok have non-meaningful DLC in it.

42:08.120 --> 42:13.800
And when I say that, I mean, like, non, I mean, DLC that is not an extensive story

42:13.800 --> 42:14.600
addition.

42:14.600 --> 42:20.520
If it has non-meaningful DLC in it, then that whole statement is bullshit in my opinion.

42:20.760 --> 42:25.640
If God of War Ragnarok has a season pass, that's a bullshit statement.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.600
Now, because like Gran Turismo, like, for example, it did that.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.600
Well, but well, they're paying for it now, aren't they?

42:32.600 --> 42:37.160
Because it's that one's pretty much universally lauded as the worst in the series at this

42:37.160 --> 42:37.480
point.

42:38.200 --> 42:39.240
So there is that.

42:41.400 --> 42:49.560
Also, I thought I was going to say with oh, with Microsoft.

42:50.680 --> 42:56.520
We see that there are things like, you know, Forza Horizon 4, as brilliant of a game as

42:56.520 --> 42:59.400
that is, there is no shortage of DLC in that game.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.120
Halo Infinite season pass.

43:02.920 --> 43:07.160
So Microsoft does monetize it in other ways.

43:07.160 --> 43:10.760
So that's why I'm kind of putting that AMB comparison there.

43:10.760 --> 43:17.480
Because again, in Jim Ryan's words, we wouldn't be able to invest in the way that we're

43:17.480 --> 43:18.440
currently able to.

43:18.840 --> 43:23.960
But it's a season pass for Halo for single player or for multiplayer multiplayer, because

43:23.960 --> 43:24.760
multiplayer is free.

43:25.400 --> 43:25.720
Right.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.960
But then there's season pass for cosmetics on top of that.

43:29.240 --> 43:29.880
Well, that makes sense.

43:29.880 --> 43:31.720
If it's a free to play game, right?

43:31.720 --> 43:35.960
Not a $70 game that Sony is charging for the racing sim.

43:37.080 --> 43:38.680
So yeah, no, that's true.

43:38.680 --> 43:43.000
So I will be even take something like I don't know, like Forza Horizon 4, or whatever it

43:43.000 --> 43:45.160
is, is that Forza Horizon 4 is bad.

43:45.160 --> 43:47.160
Yeah, as far as microtransactions.

43:48.040 --> 43:48.540
Yeah.

43:51.400 --> 43:51.900
Okay.

43:53.560 --> 43:54.760
Sorry, I keep Jamie.

43:54.760 --> 43:58.040
Jeremy, every time you get up and walk away, it screws up my Discord thing.

43:58.040 --> 43:58.600
Sorry.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.360
Just are you back?

44:01.800 --> 44:02.840
Okay, I don't think she's back.

44:02.840 --> 44:03.340
All right.

44:04.040 --> 44:09.800
Anyway, Bobby Black Wolf does point out Forza Horizon 5 actually doesn't have any DLC yet.

44:09.800 --> 44:18.600
What about the map and all that stuff that isn't in that game?

44:20.440 --> 44:22.760
Like the pay to unlock the entire map and all that stuff?

44:24.760 --> 44:25.880
Oh, all right.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.560
I guess I'm misremembering.

44:28.120 --> 44:29.800
I thought there was like cars and stuff.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.200
Oh, yeah, the treasure map.

44:32.200 --> 44:33.800
Okay, so there's at least something in there.

44:35.080 --> 44:36.760
Okay, there's no new car packs yet.

44:36.760 --> 44:37.160
All right.

44:37.160 --> 44:37.400
All right.

44:37.400 --> 44:38.760
That's what the chat is filling me in on.

44:38.760 --> 44:39.480
Okay.

44:39.480 --> 44:39.880
All right.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

44:41.000 --> 44:41.960
Let's go to our next story.

44:41.960 --> 44:42.600
Dark Sakura.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.520
I need I need a moment.

44:52.520 --> 44:53.000
Sorry.

44:53.000 --> 44:53.500
Sure.

44:55.080 --> 44:59.320
Let's see if there's other comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

45:00.920 --> 45:01.560
Where?

45:01.560 --> 45:04.600
Yeah, SJ100 Matt's confirming getting paid to unlock the map.

45:05.320 --> 45:07.960
Oh, Mike Deft is bringing up Chocobo GP.

45:08.680 --> 45:09.240
Oh, yes.

45:09.800 --> 45:10.840
Oh, yeah, that game.

45:10.840 --> 45:14.360
But I mean, technically, that game exists in a free to play mode.

45:15.080 --> 45:19.880
But they still it's still bad, even on the paid mode or whatever.

45:19.880 --> 45:23.720
They still have like a ton of the microtransactions stuff in there.

45:24.440 --> 45:29.240
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I still paid $100 for her for horizon five, even though

45:29.240 --> 45:31.160
I have game pass, but I'm weird.

45:32.360 --> 45:34.520
Yeah, no, it's your money.

45:34.520 --> 45:35.720
Spend it on how you want.

45:35.720 --> 45:41.000
I think one of the smart things Microsoft did was that whole like three days of early

45:41.000 --> 45:45.560
access, because you know, people will pay extra money to be able to play it first.

45:45.560 --> 45:47.720
And I think that's they're not the first to do it.

45:48.520 --> 45:53.320
We've seen that we've seen that for worse as well on EA side, when they put out like

45:53.320 --> 45:58.200
Mass Effect Andromeda early, and just enough in time for people to find all the bugs and

45:58.200 --> 45:59.320
shine a light on it.

45:59.320 --> 46:02.920
But for Forza Horizon five was ready for prime time.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.200
That was the difference.

46:04.200 --> 46:05.320
So there was that.

46:06.680 --> 46:07.720
Um, okay.

46:07.720 --> 46:10.280
Okay, I guess I could talk about this while we wait for Jamie.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.120
Pod culture and chat chat says fill time and tell us about the new thing that you and Alan

46:16.120 --> 46:16.760
picked up.

46:16.760 --> 46:17.720
Okay, I will.

46:18.440 --> 46:27.160
Here's the I've been hesitant to talk extensively about it because we are in the process of

46:27.160 --> 46:28.520
adopting a cat.

46:28.520 --> 46:31.640
So you'll notice I didn't say we adopted a cat.

46:31.640 --> 46:34.040
We're in the process of adopting a cat.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.920
Because we're doing that whole trial run thing.

46:37.800 --> 46:42.760
We did identify a cat who has a very similar story to Mr. Smoosh.

46:43.880 --> 46:45.720
And yes, everything's fine with Mr. Smoosh.

46:45.720 --> 46:48.680
We've always just wanted to have more than one cat.

46:48.680 --> 46:53.400
And now that we have a house with no landlord to tell us how many cats we can and can't

46:53.400 --> 46:53.880
have.

46:53.880 --> 46:56.840
I mean, we know we should probably limit ourselves.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.520
We shouldn't have like 20 cats.

46:58.600 --> 47:00.520
I want to that might that might be a problem.

47:00.520 --> 47:01.480
But two cats.

47:01.480 --> 47:03.160
That's reason two cats is reasonable.

47:03.160 --> 47:07.480
I would say three is about the most two is reasonable for me.

47:07.480 --> 47:08.520
Everybody's different.

47:08.520 --> 47:09.640
I don't run your life.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.680
But for us, you know, in this house, two or three is fine.

47:13.640 --> 47:16.040
So yes, we are trial running a new cat.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.080
His name is cheddar.

47:17.720 --> 47:21.800
We didn't name him, but he's a Japanese bobtail cat.

47:21.800 --> 47:28.360
So he has more of like a bunny rabbit tail than a full cat tail.

47:28.520 --> 47:35.000
So he was called cheddar, because whoever found that cat originally because cheddar

47:35.000 --> 47:36.600
is six years old at this point.

47:36.600 --> 47:40.520
And that's another reason why we wanted to try to adopt cheddar is because not a lot

47:40.520 --> 47:43.080
of people adopt adult cats.

47:43.080 --> 47:45.080
But Smoosh is seven or eight.

47:45.080 --> 47:49.320
So we wanted to get a cat that was around smoosh his age and he has a real similar story

47:50.040 --> 47:53.400
where cheddar was abandoned for my story.

47:53.400 --> 47:55.880
Okay, I'll get to you in just a sec because now I'm talking to this other thing.

47:55.880 --> 47:59.080
So cheddar, you know, has this story.

48:00.120 --> 48:04.760
And so we're trial running to see if cheddar will work out.

48:04.760 --> 48:10.360
He's been he's a very shy boy, and he's been very, very shy and skittish.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.280
He has not been using the litter box.

48:12.280 --> 48:16.200
I think he finally did last night, but he's barely eating or drinking.

48:16.200 --> 48:19.880
He's just a scared little boy, or big boy at this point.

48:19.880 --> 48:24.200
So I'm hoping soon, we can mix cheddar and smoosh.

48:24.200 --> 48:28.920
But, you know, we got to wait for cheddar to get a little more comfortable before we

48:28.920 --> 48:30.360
put the stress of another cat.

48:30.360 --> 48:32.040
So everybody cross your fingers and toes.

48:32.040 --> 48:34.840
Dark soccer got to meet cheddar today because she was by the house.

48:34.840 --> 48:39.400
So hopefully, yeah, hopefully everybody likes cheddar.

48:39.400 --> 48:42.600
So all right, let's go to the next story dark soccer.

48:42.600 --> 48:52.120
So there have been reports of GameStop call, you know, various GameStop stores calling

48:52.120 --> 48:58.040
customers and canceling their preorders of the Amico from Intellivision.

48:59.080 --> 49:06.120
There's emails and screenshots up and the email reads, Dear so and so, due to vendor

49:06.120 --> 49:10.520
cancellation, we will be unable to fulfill your order number, etc.

49:10.520 --> 49:13.160
We will be canceling your order and you will not be charged.

49:14.520 --> 49:20.920
Also, members of the Intellivision Amico club have been reporting that their orders were

49:20.920 --> 49:21.720
also canceled.

49:22.440 --> 49:27.560
And the it's a big red flag.

49:27.560 --> 49:36.360
And so basically, I think that they're realizing that they weren't getting the investments

49:36.360 --> 49:39.480
in it that they needed to have to be able to fulfill the orders.

49:41.080 --> 49:46.280
So yeah, it's it's pretty much going to be gone.

49:47.960 --> 49:51.560
What's interesting is that and I've made it no secret on this program, I preordered

49:51.560 --> 49:55.000
Amico, you know, it was in a very different place two years ago.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.320
And it's it's interesting.

49:57.320 --> 50:03.080
I I'm not going to be like the biggest Intellivision or Amico defender in this world.

50:03.080 --> 50:07.560
But what I find interesting is the massive hate boner people have for Tommy Tallarico

50:07.560 --> 50:09.080
and really want to see him fail.

50:09.800 --> 50:13.640
Even though he's no longer involved, essentially, at this point, people really want to see him

50:13.640 --> 50:14.140
fail.

50:14.600 --> 50:21.960
And in my mind, that completely disregards a lot of the independent developers who wanted

50:21.960 --> 50:23.240
to make games for this thing.

50:24.200 --> 50:26.760
And a lot of you know, that that end of it.

50:26.760 --> 50:33.080
And there was a lot of interesting, I think, methodologies into the developments of the

50:33.080 --> 50:37.160
games to this console where I wanted to see where it would kind of turn out.

50:37.720 --> 50:39.240
And I thought it was going to be interesting.

50:39.240 --> 50:46.280
Again, that vision was a lot different in February of 2020 than where we're at now with

50:46.280 --> 50:47.560
all that's happened since then.

50:48.200 --> 50:52.040
So, you know, I at this point, I assume I'm not seeing my $100.

50:52.920 --> 50:58.360
Again, that that here we go again, I should have learned my Kickstarter lesson, I should

50:58.360 --> 51:01.960
never back these things ever back these things.

51:01.960 --> 51:06.360
And I swear I won't ever again until there is actually a product.

51:06.360 --> 51:09.720
No, until there is actually a product on the table.

51:09.720 --> 51:13.160
That's why I didn't even back the new Yacht Club Games thing.

51:13.160 --> 51:14.920
And I'm sure they'll deliver on that.

51:14.920 --> 51:17.720
But I'm just sick and fucking tired of Kickstarter.

51:17.720 --> 51:18.840
And things like it.

51:18.840 --> 51:21.080
I am sick and fucking tired of it.

51:21.080 --> 51:28.040
So like, I'm not going to do any more these things until we actually have like, like,

51:28.040 --> 51:33.400
it's got to be for publishing or something where that is what the Kickstarter is backing,

51:33.400 --> 51:35.560
that there's an actual finished product ready to go.

51:36.360 --> 51:41.480
I'm pissed off that we had somebody on this show that was making a game on Kickstarter.

51:41.480 --> 51:43.400
That game still isn't fucking out.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.040
I'm not having Kickstarter guests on this show ever again.

51:48.120 --> 51:51.720
So I say that and then fast forward to a year from now we have one on.

51:51.720 --> 51:55.720
But if it's again, if it's somebody I know, might be different.

51:55.720 --> 51:59.000
And somebody again, where there's like publishing and that whole thing.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.720
It depends how much of a kickstart they need.

52:01.720 --> 52:04.280
I'm willing to consider on a case by case basis.

52:04.280 --> 52:07.720
But you know, I think I kind of I've learned my lesson time and time again.

52:08.680 --> 52:13.000
I've also been asked, if the amico comes out, will you still want one?

52:14.120 --> 52:15.480
Yeah, I do.

52:15.480 --> 52:19.400
Because now we're at the point where this is like the 3DO.

52:19.400 --> 52:21.640
And it's like, it's going to be a collector's item.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.160
So yeah, I want an amico.

52:24.120 --> 52:25.800
I just don't think I'm getting one.

52:25.800 --> 52:29.880
I have not gotten one of these emails, though, which is and I did not order through GameStop

52:29.880 --> 52:32.200
I ordered directly through Intellivision's website.

52:32.200 --> 52:36.120
But you even said there a lot of the people in the Intellivision got any I didn't get an email.

52:36.920 --> 52:38.520
And I was listening to Bobby's show tonight.

52:38.520 --> 52:39.400
And I know he backed it.

52:39.400 --> 52:40.600
He didn't get an email either.

52:40.600 --> 52:43.720
So there's a weird circle of people that didn't get this.

52:43.720 --> 52:44.760
Maybe it's on its way.

52:44.760 --> 52:47.880
Maybe next week, I'll be like, well, the email came in, y'all.

52:47.880 --> 52:52.200
Um, but it's because they have the date, the release date.

52:52.200 --> 52:52.600
I don't know.

52:52.600 --> 52:55.960
I'm assuming this placeholder for the 31st of March.

52:56.520 --> 53:01.160
And they had a thing where it actually charged people for their preorder.

53:01.160 --> 53:06.440
It charged them the full amount because, you know, it was set to come out already.

53:06.440 --> 53:08.600
But then the vendor didn't update the date.

53:08.600 --> 53:10.760
And I'm guessing they don't have an updated date for it.

53:10.760 --> 53:12.760
That's why they're refunding them.

53:12.760 --> 53:17.240
Because amico is certainly not refunding people, even if you ask for a refund.

53:17.240 --> 53:23.480
So if you have one preordered through other means, stop that payment ASAP, because you're

53:23.480 --> 53:25.080
not going to get your money back otherwise.

53:25.640 --> 53:30.360
And they're the reason I think people are mad at taught me to go, not necessarily because

53:30.360 --> 53:31.480
they just want to see him fail.

53:31.480 --> 53:37.080
It's because he's been basically not addressing issues with or concerns that people have and

53:37.080 --> 53:38.680
just calling people haters.

53:38.680 --> 53:44.920
And also just straight up lying about what the system can do when it's available, what

53:44.920 --> 53:49.880
you know, everything just hyping the thing up to a ridiculous point and having nothing

53:49.880 --> 53:50.840
to show for it.

53:50.840 --> 53:56.680
They just put out an unboxing video to try to secure even more investments right now.

53:56.680 --> 54:01.400
Probably, I think there's somebody in Germany that they're trying to secure investments

54:01.400 --> 54:03.720
for to make it look like it's an actual product.

54:03.720 --> 54:05.720
But this product isn't even a thing.

54:05.720 --> 54:07.480
It didn't come off the assembly line.

54:07.480 --> 54:11.000
It's a prototype that they've had in their office, but they're passing it off.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.400
It's like, look, see, the product's almost ready to go.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.720
It's a bunch of bullshit.

54:15.720 --> 54:16.440
Here's the thing.

54:16.440 --> 54:17.640
That's why people are mad at him.

54:17.640 --> 54:20.600
He's and he's not the first carnival barker in this industry.

54:20.600 --> 54:21.080
Let's be real.

54:21.080 --> 54:22.440
There's a lot of them out there.

54:22.440 --> 54:24.120
A lot of carnival barkers in the industry.

54:24.920 --> 54:30.440
I think there's a sense of pride with this whole they got screwed by the, you know, the

54:30.440 --> 54:33.880
computer chip people, because that's that's the core problem at the end of the day here.

54:33.880 --> 54:34.680
No, it's not.

54:34.680 --> 54:35.000
You know what?

54:35.000 --> 54:39.480
No, what they got screwed by is their stupid idea, their stupid business decisions.

54:39.480 --> 54:44.040
They literally have taken out a loan from one of the shareholders.

54:44.680 --> 54:49.240
It's one of the people that's on the board where they have in order to pay it back.

54:49.240 --> 54:55.480
They have to take $100 off of or they have to take $100 for every unit sold.

54:56.200 --> 54:58.440
How are you going to make any profit on a console?

54:58.440 --> 55:00.920
Consoles don't have that kind of margin as it is.

55:00.920 --> 55:03.160
So that's doomed to failure right there.

55:03.160 --> 55:07.800
They're just trying to make the company look, you know, good enough to sell it off is what

55:07.800 --> 55:08.840
they're going to do.

55:08.840 --> 55:10.520
So it's it's just bad.

55:10.520 --> 55:12.280
There's a lot of just bad stuff.

55:12.280 --> 55:15.720
I've been following it and it's all bad.

55:16.280 --> 55:17.560
There's nothing good from it.

55:18.200 --> 55:22.920
Well, but also, you know, again, there were people that were developing for this thing

55:22.920 --> 55:28.520
that were like, you know, the people that were making that breakout redo, that is essentially

55:28.520 --> 55:30.040
the bit trip gang.

55:30.040 --> 55:34.280
You know, they were putting out what looked like a pretty quality product for that console.

55:34.280 --> 55:36.040
No matter how you feel about it.

55:36.040 --> 55:40.040
That game looks like it was, you know, making the best of it by the way.

55:40.040 --> 55:40.920
Oh, did it really?

55:40.920 --> 55:43.560
I actually didn't know that platforms already.

55:43.560 --> 55:45.720
It's that that's a telltale sign.

55:45.720 --> 55:47.000
Slightly different.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.960
You know, yeah, that's why that game looked good, because it was already being developed

55:49.960 --> 55:51.160
for other platforms.

55:51.160 --> 55:54.120
Tommy wanted everything to be exclusive to their platform.

55:54.120 --> 55:58.760
But that also could mean that it's an exclusive mode that's in there or something like that.

55:58.760 --> 56:00.760
But it would have a certain gameplay option.

56:00.760 --> 56:06.680
There was was that was that was the backing down because his his big mouth got him into

56:06.680 --> 56:07.800
trouble, right?

56:09.560 --> 56:15.320
The moon later game that he had or whatever, their couch co-op mode in that is that each

56:15.320 --> 56:18.440
person gets a different button they use to control the thing.

56:18.440 --> 56:21.960
So one person may move left, one person may move right, one person may jump, the other

56:21.960 --> 56:23.800
person may do something else.

56:23.800 --> 56:24.760
That's stupid.

56:24.760 --> 56:26.760
It's absolutely dumb like that.

56:26.760 --> 56:30.520
That's their big selling point of about this couch co-op and bringing the family together

56:30.520 --> 56:31.400
and stuff.

56:31.400 --> 56:34.680
And I whatever, none of these games are coming out.

56:34.680 --> 56:36.200
I don't even know why we're concerned with stuff.

56:36.200 --> 56:40.680
And the fact that they sold these NFT things for games that they know are never going to

56:40.680 --> 56:41.720
be released.

56:41.720 --> 56:42.760
That's ridiculous.

56:42.760 --> 56:44.360
Somebody saw dollar signs in that.

56:44.680 --> 56:48.440
That's all this NFT ever is, is that people that's why celebs are getting involved.

56:48.440 --> 56:49.560
They just see dollar signs.

56:49.560 --> 56:50.200
That's all they see.

56:50.840 --> 56:55.240
That was that was an escape hatch for Intellivision to get these funding issues.

56:55.240 --> 56:57.800
Oh, people are paying $100,000 for NFTs.

56:57.800 --> 56:59.000
Let's get in on that.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.680
Like that's that's that's all it is.

57:01.400 --> 57:05.960
So anyway, for now, let's move on for more stories.

57:06.840 --> 57:13.160
Loki about another gaming company face a boy if you think you think Intellivision has bad

57:13.160 --> 57:16.280
owners, try this next was bad.

57:16.280 --> 57:19.240
It's like, you know, on the board of a company.

57:19.240 --> 57:23.960
How about Mohammed Buzzsaw or Salman?

57:23.960 --> 57:28.440
You know, the guy that, you know, murdered people.

57:29.720 --> 57:31.480
Allegedly murdered.

57:31.480 --> 57:32.360
He murdered people.

57:32.360 --> 57:36.360
OK, he killed people, killed, you know, reporters and stuff like that.

57:36.360 --> 57:40.920
Well, he owns 96.18% of SNK now.

57:41.160 --> 57:47.640
So because he invested in them and so, yeah, so now now when you buy an SNK game, know

57:47.640 --> 57:50.280
that the money is going to a goddamn murderer.

57:50.280 --> 57:54.120
So how do we feel good about those King of Fighter games?

57:54.120 --> 57:55.800
How do we get that to stop?

57:55.800 --> 57:58.360
How do we take and I realize the answer is you don't.

57:58.360 --> 58:02.280
But I think a lot of people are feeling some type of way because, you know, we also have

58:02.280 --> 58:07.000
that news about Elon Musk buying, you know, his a stake of Twitter and buying a seat on

58:07.000 --> 58:07.960
the board, essentially.

58:08.200 --> 58:12.520
And look, I'm not trying to necessarily equate those two people, but the reality is it's

58:12.520 --> 58:14.520
on a lot of people's mind as well this week.

58:14.520 --> 58:16.920
And I think a lot of people are like, how can we stop that from happening?

58:16.920 --> 58:18.120
And most people are like, you can't.

58:19.080 --> 58:24.600
And it just seems weird, like that you can't stop him from coming in and taking over that

58:24.600 --> 58:27.720
much of the company where now it just feels like dirty.

58:27.720 --> 58:28.520
You know what I mean?

58:30.600 --> 58:31.800
Yeah, I just.

58:33.240 --> 58:35.880
But as nothing you can do, SSG 100.

58:35.880 --> 58:36.680
SSG 100.

58:36.680 --> 58:42.280
Matt wants to point out, you know, before everybody starts protesting and the whole

58:43.080 --> 58:47.880
basically lending itself to it is you really can't be an ethical consumer in a capitalist

58:47.880 --> 58:50.360
society is really what it is as to 100.

58:50.360 --> 58:55.800
Matt says he sadly owns a lot of minority shares of many companies, banks, airlines,

58:55.800 --> 58:56.300
etc.

58:59.240 --> 59:00.760
But who's going to hold him accountable?

59:03.160 --> 59:04.040
Nobody, nobody.

59:04.920 --> 59:08.120
And that's that's that's what gets very frustrating about this world sometimes.

59:09.720 --> 59:14.920
Anyway, let's try to move on to happier news and things that maybe, you know, we can we

59:14.920 --> 59:19.480
can we can wrap ourselves in a little blanket and feel better about these types of news

59:19.480 --> 59:21.480
for what they're worth.

59:21.480 --> 59:24.520
And that is return to Monkey Island.

59:24.520 --> 59:27.720
Yes, it's a thing that's absolutely want to return to Monkey Island.

59:27.720 --> 59:30.200
It's it's not just an April Fool's joke.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.640
And it's by Ron Gilbert.

59:31.880 --> 59:37.400
I Ron Gilbert is indeed working on a new entry called Return to Monkey Island.

59:37.400 --> 59:38.600
It's going to come out this year.

59:38.600 --> 59:40.840
There is a new trailer available on YouTube.

59:41.640 --> 59:47.800
It is a follow up to Monkey the Secret Monkey Island and Monkey Island to Le Chunk's Le

59:47.800 --> 59:49.480
Chunk Le Chuck's Revenge.

59:50.200 --> 59:51.720
Le Chunk was from the Goonies.

59:51.720 --> 59:52.220
Sorry.

59:53.640 --> 59:56.920
So I guess this is Monkey Island three in some ways.

59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.200
Terrible Toy Box is making this game.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.440
They made Thimbleweed Park for those that know that one, which was a great.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.400
Yeah, that was like a giveaway on Epic Game Store and stuff.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.200
Not that long ago.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:15.400
Also, Rex Crowl, who did design with games like Tearaway and Little Big Planet.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.360
That's a pretty good name.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.680
That's he's the art director.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.040
So that's going to be pretty exciting.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.240
It's good.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:21.480
Yeah.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.680
Otherwise, we don't know a whole lot more about it.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.360
That's pretty much all we know at this time.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.440
But this is this also has nothing to do with because Telltale did a Monkey Island game

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.520
like they did a reboot of the first game a while ago.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:32.680
Right.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:35.880
But this is not this has nothing to do with any of that.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.680
So this is a new a new game from the Thimbleweed Park folks.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:45.000
They are collaborating with Lucasfilm Games, a Disney company.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.000
I don't think Lucasfilm actually has their own development studio at this point.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.680
No, it's like a holdings thing at this point.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.720
It's licensing.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.040
Yeah.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.440
Yeah.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.840
As 100 Matt points out, they're also getting the voice cast from the previous games.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.640
That's pretty cool.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:06.360
That's that is like literally like the 90s television reboot, like the X Files coming

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.720
back for another season or Roseanne.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.960
But then Roseanne's a monster.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:17.400
So it's the Connors comes back for a new season and all these and all the game shows.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.120
Press Your Luck is back and all these game shows coming back.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.440
It's like the video game version of that.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.640
And they're getting the band all back together to do the voices.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.440
So that's pretty cool.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.920
We get another Maniac Mansion game because I'd like to see another Maniac Mansion game.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.880
It's all about the money.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:36.280
Bobby Black Wolf points out he's bringing in characters from the later Monkey Island

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.640
games that he didn't do.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.640
So he's not honoring their story, but he's honoring the characters.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:50.120
That reminds me of the Blaster Master Zero franchise making that character from the FX

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.600
Nine books canon to the series.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.400
Eve is canon to the series based on those books that hardly anybody read.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.440
But yeah, anyway.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.960
So yeah, it's still it's still it's exciting that it's coming back.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.840
So that'd be nice.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.040
All right.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.040
Maybe something exciting for the future up next.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:08.680
Dark Sakura?

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.040
I swear every time I try to unmute, it mutes itself right back again.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:25.320
Um, so the director of Sonic 2, basically his name is Jeff Fowler.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:31.640
He's gone on record saying that he would love to do a Smash Brothers movie.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.320
The quote is nothing would make me happier than to throw all the characters into a battle

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.880
royale, getting Mario and Sonic in the ring.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.520
I mean, everyone would be kind of dying for that, right?

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.240
It's a classic.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:49.000
So and I mean, in that game, though, would touch so many different franchises that I

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
think the licensing would be very difficult because it's not just Nintendo.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.160
We have Namco, we have Capcom, we have all kinds of of areas.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.320
I just don't know how something like that would work.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.240
Or they could go like early Smash Brothers and just throw Sonic in there.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:05.960
Yes.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.800
You know, that way they don't license too much.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.920
It's all Nintendo, really.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.040
Yeah, but still, I don't know.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.800
I don't know how they make this.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.800
The story works fine for a game.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.880
I don't know that it would work well for a movie.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.720
Bobby does point out Wreck-It Ralph did the multiple license thing pretty well.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:27.320
But it didn't showcase they were mostly background people.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.600
Yeah, everyone who was a main character was effectively someone new.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:41.000
I think this is one of those weird fan expectations that shouldn't exist in reality.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:46.520
It seems very disconnected from the reality of how movies get financed and all that stuff.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.880
Like, I'm just being honest.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:53.000
Sure, as a video gaming fan, the idea of a Super Smash Brothers movie and all those characters

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.840
on screen is awesome.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:00.120
But the reality is, A, I don't see where the plot comes from.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:09.240
B, I feel like getting all those characters together in one place is going to be too expensive

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.240
for the type of movie that you're going to get.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.080
S200 Matt says Rob is ruining everyone's fanfic dreams.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:15.960
That's what I do here.

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:17.960
It is what it is.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:24.120
Like, I think we should just all focus on right now, hoping that the Mario movie is

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:30.520
going to be really good, despite whatever reservations I have about the voice actors.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.020
Yeah.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.240
And the Sonic movies have been well received, whether you like them or not.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.640
At the end of the day, they made money.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.080
That's what it's about.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.120
Detective Pikachu.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.160
It made money, right?

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.840
They're going to make another one, if I remember right.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.120
So there you got that.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.800
If the Mario movie does well, you know, like, that's that's got to be the first step.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.440
These movies have to make quite a bit of money, and then maybe we'll cross that bridge.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:59.080
But I feel like if the Mario movie does well, it's going to lend itself to the Donkey

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.960
Kong movie and Donkey Kong Country in that.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.080
And I, I just-

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.320
Donkey Kong is supposed to be in that movie.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:10.280
I know, but there's all the rumors about they're setting it up for a spinoff intentionally.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.480
So I think Nintendo kind of has to, like, live that out for a little bit before it's

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.920
going to be, okay, call Sega and let's get Sonic.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.840
Call, you know, Konami and let's get Snake and all this other stuff.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:29.080
I just, I feel like Nintendo, Nintendo is getting back into movies after a very long

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:29.580
absence.

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:35.260
But I think the success of Sonic, again, whether you like it or not, it made money.

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:41.740
The success of Sonic is going to lend itself well to Mario, because I think you're going

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:47.500
to have that audience of people that grew up with Mario taking their kids who also are

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.620
growing up with Mario.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.100
And that's why that movie will do well.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.100
So we'll see.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:59.340
Esther shown her mat says people are writing in Ryan Reynolds Detective Pikachu fighting

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.700
Chris Pratt Mario and Seth Rogen DK.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.340
Okay, what fanfic ever got made into a movie?

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:09.580
Of course, as those words leave my leave my mouth now I'm going Oh fuck, there was 50

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.460
shades of gray.

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.460
That movie literally ruined everything.

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.620
That movie literally ruined everything.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.340
So it's like, what fanfic became a movie?

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.580
Oh, oh, that.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.080
Right.

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:21.440
Right.

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:26.300
Anyway, all right, moving on, Loki.

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:28.700
All right.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:35.420
So, you know, we talked a little bit about some previous goes recon games with break

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.420
point and their whole NFT thing.

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.460
Well, break point wasn't all that great.

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:47.020
And now Ubisoft is ending their updates for break point and its live service plans.

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:52.700
Once again, you know, all these companies pushing for live service games, and then they

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:55.020
just quit on them after a short period of time.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:00.220
Don't get too invested in them, especially with NFTs.

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:02.300
Because now those entities are worth what nothing.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:03.820
It's like that.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:08.540
I mean, with that racing game that closed down this last week to had a bunch of stuff

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:08.860
in it.

01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:12.380
And now it's, you know, granted that nice fucking trash.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:17.100
But like, it's, it's, you know, what, what's the point of it?

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:21.340
Am I going to be able to use my NFT helmet in this next goes recon game they put out?

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:24.140
No, probably not.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:25.740
Cool.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.300
Glad you really dived in the NFTs.

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:32.300
So yeah, it's going to be was it I think.

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:38.460
Yeah, the both says they're going to continue to maintain the service for both goes recon

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:40.220
wild land and break point.

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.300
But they're gonna not be updating it.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:51.500
So, oh, Bobby says there are five movies based on fanfics.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.060
Really?

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:52.700
What are the other?

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:57.180
Okay, well, there were three movies in the 50 shades of gray.

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.140
So what are the other two?

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:08.220
I'm curious what the other two are as soon as Matt says Ubisoft is trying to find new

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:12.620
decimals to support NFTs, because they're already double, triple and quadruple down

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.340
on NFTs.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.540
Mortal Instruments is a Harry Potter fanfic.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.020
Really?

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:17.980
What's Mortal Instruments?

01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:18.700
I've never heard of it.

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:24.060
That's the one with the the like cities that are on wheels that are like driving around

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:24.940
and fighting each other.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:31.180
Pixel pocket says a one direction one and Bobby Blackwell says it's called after that

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.660
a one direction fanfic got turned into a movie really?

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.020
Here's the thing.

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.820
There's any of my fanfics get turned into movies or books there.

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.740
There's there's the right people, I guess.

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.900
A fanfic and then there's okay, okay.

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:45.980
Was Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter?

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:47.020
Was that a fanfic?

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.340
Technically, that's a fanfic.

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.180
Because I feel like it was.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.980
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies really was.

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:54.860
I guess that's true.

01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:56.300
I guess you guys are right.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:01.180
There's those what they're so fucking ludicrous that they kind of have to get made.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.540
So I guess there's that.

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.500
That should be a movie.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.420
So fucking ludicrous starring ludicrous.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:10.060
And then it should have co-star Raven.

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.660
Because she's so Raven.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:13.520
Yeah.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:16.220
All right, moving on.

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:18.780
Let's talk about Pac-Land.

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.060
This is ludicrous, too.

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.660
I don't understand this.

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:22.220
Well, I do.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.020
I completely do.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.700
But it's just it's weird.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.700
So arcade archives, right?

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.740
There's like a lot of games.

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:29.580
There's over 100 games in that series.

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:34.780
That is a lot of the ports for of classic arcade games for PlayStation.

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:39.020
And not Xbox for some reason, but Nintendo Switch as well.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:44.060
So Pac-Land recently came out on Arcade Archives.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.820
It came out on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:50.780
Pac-Land, which, funny enough, we referenced on the show last week.

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:55.420
We're not intending to be the official Pac-Land podcast, but sometimes it happens.

01:09:55.420 --> 01:10:00.140
But I believe last week, Dark Sakura was talking about Mappy Land because it was just coming

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.820
out on Nintendo Switch online.

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.620
And it kind of led to a conversation about that weird era of Namco and their land games,

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.980
which includes Pac-Land.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.860
So it's the side scrolling Pac-Man game.

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:16.300
I'm going to say something that my co-host may not agree with, but it wasn't very good,

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.220
in my opinion.

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.020
It wasn't good.

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:19.820
I played it.

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.020
It was different.

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:21.820
It was different.

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.020
And that's what a lot of people remember.

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:28.380
And it was, I think what a lot of people liked about it was that it looked very cartoony,

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:32.860
and that was in that era where it was like, oh, it almost looks like a playable cartoon,

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.940
like not like Dragon.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:38.620
I almost said Dragon Age, Dragon's Lair style playable cartoon.

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.540
But you know, like the games of that era.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.820
Anyway, here's the thing.

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:46.540
So Pac-Land did come out in 1984.

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:52.700
And it also should be pointed out, it was based off the animated show from the 80s,

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.340
the Hanna-Barbera Pac-Man show that was on for a little while.

01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:01.740
And in the very beginning of the game, you basically see where Pac-Man is leaving home

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:05.740
and waves goodbye to Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Baby or Baby Pac-Man.

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.020
Well, guess what?

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:13.740
Ms. Pac-Man is not in this Arcade Archives reboot.

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:22.540
Now there is a character called Pac-Mom who has like a pink ponytail instead of the red

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:27.660
bow, and Baby Pac-Man has been replaced with an unnamed character as well.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:32.060
Pac-Mom comes from Pac-Man Museum Plus.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:32.940
Here's the thing.

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:40.380
There is apparently a little bit of legal drama going on behind the scenes because Bandai

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:45.180
Namco still owns the Ms. Pac-Man property and can use Ms. Pac-Man wherever they want.

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:51.980
But every time the depiction is used, a royalty is paid out to AT Games because they have

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:55.980
a percentage of the royalty rights for Ms. Pac-Man every time she appears.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:02.700
So Bandai Namco, not really liking this deal, decided to change the character so they don't

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.540
have to pay AT Games shit.

01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:11.980
And it's interesting because there is a Pac-Man Museum Plus that's on its way out and Ms.

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:13.020
Pac-Man's not in it.

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.900
Apparently Pac-Mom is in it though, somewhere in the museum.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.220
I don't know if it's the Pac-Lam thing or whatever.

01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:23.020
So this is just very interesting where the character's been essentially erased due to

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:23.980
legal reasons.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.540
Although anybody looking at these screenshots...

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:29.420
And let me see if I can post the link to this tweet on...

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:31.260
Gosh darn.

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.860
Let me see if I can get this Twitter link here.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:41.660
Sorry everyone for the bad audio there.

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.460
Okay, I got the link.

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.300
I'm going to paste this in our chat.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.740
And it's somebody's Twitter account.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.620
And for the podcast listeners, Nick is on line T, all one word.

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:58.300
And they wrote a tweet on April 6th that shows the Pac-Mom and Ms. Pac-Man side by side.

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:02.060
Pixel Paca's suggesting Pac-Mam as a possible name.

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:03.900
Sure, whatever.

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.460
But this is what they ended up calling her.

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:08.380
Legally distinct Pac-Mom.

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:15.500
Yeah, legally distinctly different Pac-Mom who had her bow replaced with a very Karen

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.220
ponytail.

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:18.860
Pat Karen is what she kind of looks like to me, to be honest.

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.380
Karen doesn't have a ponytail.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.100
Karen has that weird wedge haircut.

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:23.600
Yeah.

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.980
So anyway.

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:28.380
Let's see.

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:33.340
Bobby Black Wolf says Ms. Pac-Man was the one that was made by that other company that

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.140
modded Pac-Man arcade machines in the early 80s, right?

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.540
I saw it on the Netflix high score documentary.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:42.460
Yeah, Ms. Pac-Man all started as a mod for the original Pac-Man machines because they

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.380
weren't coming out with something fast enough for that.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:49.180
That's where I'm like pack plus or whatever was came out of that whole thing, too.

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:50.620
So it's interesting.

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:54.380
So but also this is why arcade went up machines.

01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:57.020
A lot of the newer ones, I think one of them has Ms.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:00.460
Pac-Man in it, but most of the collections don't have Ms.

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:00.960
Pac-Man.

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.500
I think one of the first does.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.740
But like now these Namco collections, they don't have Ms.

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:06.240
Pac-Man.

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:11.020
They'll they'll they fall back on Super Pac-Man, which I enjoyed.

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.220
But a lot of people do not think it holds a candle to the original.

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:14.860
It's different.

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.580
Great.

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:16.080
It's different.

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:18.300
It's just a different challenge.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.580
Yeah, it's a different challenge.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.420
So anyway.

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.180
All right.

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:26.700
So that is that is interesting with Pac-Land.

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.340
I still am interested in that museum plus thing that's coming out.

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.620
I think that's kind of interesting.

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:40.860
But yeah, anyway, let's get to discussion on another classic game in this.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:41.420
Segment.

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:57.580
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.900
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.540
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.980
And what did you pick for us this week, Dark Sakura?

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.540
I picked Fatal Frame.

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:12.940
Which I actually haven't played and I really should.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.060
Oh, really?

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.900
In Japan, the game is known as Zero.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:24.700
And in Europe, it was called Project Zero.

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:28.540
It's a survival horror game that was made by Tecmo for PS2.

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:34.940
The game was released on December 13th, 2001.

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:38.140
It was the first in the series.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:42.540
And in North America, it came out in 2002.

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:47.020
There is an enhanced port on Xbox that came out in PlayStation 2 in North America and

01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:49.100
2003 in Japan and Europe.

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:58.380
So as far as publishing, it was published by Tecmo in both Japan and North America.

01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:05.180
And in Europe, it was done by Wannadu and then for the Xbox versions by Microsoft.

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.780
And then there was a re-release in North America for PlayStation Network in 2013.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:16.460
So it's set in 1986 and it follows these two siblings named Miku and Mahuyu Hinasaki.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:24.140
Mahuyu disappears looking for a novelist in the haunted mansion called Himuro Mansion.

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.220
And so Miku goes to find him.

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:34.700
And so through the course of the game, she acquires a camera referred to as the camera

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:46.940
Obscura and uses her own sixth sense to locate ghosts and sometimes capture the most

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.460
volatile of ghosts.

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:55.580
And it has an interesting control mechanism because when you use the camera, it switches

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:59.900
to first person and then you move it with your right analog stick and the character

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:01.020
can move with the left stick.

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.860
So it's sort of like this weird strafing thing.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:10.140
And the film is your ammo, which of course you find it all over the mansion and can replenish.

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:18.940
So basically the siblings have this special ability to see supernatural events.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:29.820
And so when Mahuyu disappears looking for his tutor, who is Takamine Junsei, Miku goes

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:34.380
to find him, like I said, and then she finds that Takamine's party was killed by the ghosts

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:38.380
and finds rope burns appearing on her wrists and ankles.

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:43.740
And it turns out that there was a ritual that happened with a particular miko or a shrine

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:49.100
maiden torn apart using the ropes attached to her limbs in a strangling ritual.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.420
Yeah, it's pretty, pretty brutal.

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:59.500
And so you learn more about the game by going through it.

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:07.500
And according to the staff of the game, the first ending is canon and leads to the events

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.860
in the third game.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:20.620
So the game, the concept of the game came to the director, Shibata Makoto, after they

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:24.780
finished working on Tecmo's Deception Invitation to Darkness.

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:31.420
He kind of got it in one of his own dreams and different encounters he thought were supernatural.

01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:38.540
And so when development started on PlayStation 2 hardware, when Tecmo got a hold of it,

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.020
it went under the name Project Zero.

01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:47.900
He also had some influence by how positively the characters in Silent Hill were received.

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:54.380
And wanted to go further and create the sense of seeing things that were off screen

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:58.940
and to create a frightening atmosphere, one as scary as possible.

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:05.740
And the key colors were black and white with white representing hope and black representing fear.

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:09.580
And they put a lot of that into the clothing and the shading.

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:19.100
And then the third color in it was the red that Miku wore and she represented life.

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:27.500
And then they put a lot of effort into focusing on stereophonic sound to reinforce the atmosphere

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:32.700
of the game to give it a more three-dimensional feeling as they were going along through it.

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:40.380
They used different motifs of spirituality.

01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:46.380
They wanted to give a feeling of isolation through the lack of the modern technology,

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:53.020
such as mobile phones and things like that.

01:19:53.500 --> 01:20:04.780
So, I mean, I think that it's a very interesting concept.

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:12.460
Famitsu really was happy with the use of the camera Obscura with the additional tension,

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:15.180
including with the visual design.

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:17.900
The game was pretty well received.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:23.580
And then, of course, there was a sequel Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Butterfly

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:26.460
and then Fatal Frame 3 The Tormented.

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:31.820
And then they announced a Hollywood adaptation in 2003.

01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:33.980
Oh, that's right.

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:41.420
But it was under a long hiatus and then re-announced for 2014 with a production.

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:48.460
It says set to begin production after the completion and released a Fatal Frame

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:49.420
made in the Blackwater.

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:52.300
Interesting.

01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:54.460
That'd be interesting if they ever really do make a movie out of this.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:57.420
Fatal Frame, classic game of the week.

01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:02.780
I'm reading some comments from chat here because Jason, our voiceover sir,

01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:05.020
has a lot to say here in chat about the series.

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:09.820
And this definitely seems like one of those games where those that have played it have a lot of

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:11.740
connection to it.

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:13.260
I think it's a cult game in that way.

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:17.980
Not like cult, like we're going to drink Kool-Aid or whatever.

01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:19.020
I'm talking like cult-like.

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:20.540
It's just like one of those.

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.780
If you played this, you know why it's cool.

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:29.340
Jason says, Fatal Frame holds a special place in my heart, by which I mean a scarred portion

01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:29.900
of my brain.

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:35.340
Fatal Frame was a catalyst for many years of utter fear and paranoia in my life from

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:37.820
about 2002 to 2007.

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:41.180
After playing through and beating one to three, I got a lot of closure.

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:44.700
I didn't kick all my fear, but it came down from being a paranoia.

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:45.900
It is a great game.

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:50.540
One to three, make a great series, assuming you are not particularly susceptible to paranormal

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.340
fears.

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:53.580
I love the game immensely.

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:54.940
And then, uh, yeah.

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.780
Jason says it's a cult classic.

01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:01.420
One may even call it an occult classic, but, um, all right.

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:02.140
So there it is.

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:05.980
Well, I mean, it, it got some really good scores.

01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:12.780
I mean, um, Famitsu gave it a 32 out of 40 for PS2, which is pretty good for Famitsu.

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:17.500
There were places that were like in the sevens to eights.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.300
Eurogamer gave it a nine out of 10 for PS2.

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:27.580
Um, I'd say it pretty, it got above average responses, but, um, the big thing that people

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:32.540
liked in the Xbox ports were the improved textures and expanded features.

01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:44.140
Um, especially, um, that those improvements were, were more of something that smooths

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:46.700
it over without making a substantial change to the game.

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:48.860
All right.

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:54.620
Well, Fatal Frame, your classic game of the week and a good choice.

01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:57.980
That's one, um, that's one I want to go back and revisit.

01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:00.460
In fact, I don't even know if I don't think I played that.

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.940
I think I watched someone else play that game.

01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.460
I think that's how that went for me.

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:07.340
It was, uh, I, uh, watched somebody else play it.

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:08.620
So, uh, yeah.

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.180
Anyway, there it is.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.100
All right.

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:13.740
Moving on.

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.100
Um, I don't know why, I'm sorry.

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.940
I lost the video of my co-host.

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:17.660
Sorry, folks.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.420
I don't know why that happened.

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:21.420
Um, but I will try to get them back here.

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:21.980
There we go.

01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:22.460
Much better.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:22.940
Sorry about that.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:28.780
The joys of recording live and trying to manage a video while managing audio.

01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:29.100
All right.

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:33.500
I need, I now, now I'm convinced I need a third monitor.

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:37.740
Like two, two isn't enough for me to do this show somewhere.

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:38.300
Really?

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.420
I might take you up on it.

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:43.180
If you're, cause I could use, I could use a third up here just for B roll stuff.

01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:44.780
Like that would be fantastic.

01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:45.260
I'll see.

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:48.220
But honestly enough, you should invest in a wide screen monitor.

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:48.780
Like I've got.

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:51.100
Yeah, those are pretty cool.

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.500
Um, they're not too expensive either.

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:53.820
Yeah.

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.060
I love the idea though of like an output.

01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:58.860
That's just like, you, you see exactly what it's going to look like.

01:23:58.860 --> 01:23:59.820
You're just capturing the screen.

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:02.380
There's a part of me that just kind of like that, but you can kind of.

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:05.020
I need to start using my iPad for my chat.

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:05.740
Yeah.

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:06.300
Yeah.

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.100
Use the sidecar.

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:08.380
Sidecar.

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:09.420
All right.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.740
I think it's a fun name.

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:12.620
No, it is a cute name.

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:13.260
I do like it.

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:13.980
All right.

01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:19.260
Let's travel around the world quickly, uh, with some other quick news stories and some

01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.700
rapid via news.

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.340
So Loki.

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:22.860
Yeah.

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:29.420
So Criterion has given us an update on their new need for speed game, which they had originally

01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:31.580
announced back in 2020.

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:39.340
Um, but that should be coming out this November on PlayStation five and the Xbox series X and S.

01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:42.620
I'm all about a new Criterion racing game.

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:46.220
I wish it was burnout though, but need for speed.

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:50.540
I guess we'll have to wait and see what that looks like, but I'd prefer it was burnout.

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.820
Um, like you're crashing stuff.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.460
Yeah, it's just burnout.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.900
Like me for speed is a classic.

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:05.100
Um, Square Enix says that they have no plans on a sequel for Chrono Cross.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:10.060
Uh, basically saying that, listen, uh, there are no plans for a sequel or a new title now,

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.220
but who knows what the future holds.

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.380
So that doesn't mean you won't get one for Chrono Trigger.

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.820
Cross was the sequel to Chrono Trigger.

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:24.940
No, I know it was, or, well, is it considered a sequel or is it considered, I thought it

01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:28.460
was just considered like, um, I don't know.

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:31.500
Like it's got Luca and everyone in it.

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:32.460
Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.940
I was trying to think like, like how shock treatment is a sequel to Rocky Horror.

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:39.020
Cause it has Brad and Janet, but it's not really a sequel.

01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:39.500
You know what I mean?

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.020
Like it's one of those types of things.

01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:42.460
So I think so.

01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:42.960
Yeah.

01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:44.860
But what, what didn't they plan?

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.620
Wasn't there another, wasn't there a chrono?

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:52.940
There was a third chrono game that was planned at some point, but I forget what it was called.

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:53.980
Um, but yeah, it'd be interesting.

01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:54.480
You never know.

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:55.520
Anyway.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.420
Uh, let's move on to our soccer.

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:01.820
Um, on the 12th, uh, sorry, I'm looking at the wrong thing.

01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:07.100
Um, so Mario golf is coming to switch online's expansion pack.

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:11.580
And for people who care about playing Mario golf.

01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:12.080
Cool.

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:14.700
Congrats to you.

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.580
64 game.

01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:17.180
And then a 10 to 64 game.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.620
Oh, yep.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.220
Um, and then Metroid Dread has had an update.

01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:24.620
It is version 2.1.0.

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.700
It adds, uh, some new modes.

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:33.020
Including boss rush, where you fight, uh, 12 continuous boss battles and aim for the best time.

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:35.740
Damage is carried over into the next fight.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.740
Although weapons are fully restored.

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:43.580
If a Samus is defeated, you can retry to continue playing from the start of the battle that you lost,

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.500
but there is a time penalty for being defeated.

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:51.340
And then the bosses fought in the boss rush can be fought one on one anytime by selecting practice.

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:55.340
There's also survival rush, where you see how many bosses you can defeat inside of a

01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:56.220
five minute limit.

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.860
You have dread rush, which is like boss rush, but if you're hit by a boss,

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.500
your energy drops to zero and you are defeated.

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.260
So it's like be perfect.

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:10.620
And then it fixed, um, an error where the game over screen would not display properly.

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:14.620
When Samus takes damage and is defeated immediately after destroying a central unit.

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.780
I need to go back and revisit Metroid Dread.

01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:22.940
I think it's one of those games where I just, the, the wrist problems I was having playing

01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:25.260
it left a really sour taste in my mouth.

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:26.780
I need to go back and give it another shot.

01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.300
And I think it's the fault of the game though.

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:33.180
It's not, but like the reality is I'm still gonna, you're still gonna, you get that Pavlov,

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:36.060
Pavlov's bell response, you know, whether it's the game's fault or not,

01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:39.340
it's still one of those things where I just associate the risk pain of playing the game.

01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:43.900
So I'm hoping that maybe I'm going to go back and revisit it and maybe I'll just use different

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:47.340
controller that won't, um, have that same effect probably.

01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:54.220
So speaking of controllers, um, we just got like the two of the SNES controllers

01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:56.060
and a Genesis controller for switch.

01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:56.560
Oh yeah.

01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:57.740
Yeah.

01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:01.820
Maybe something like that that is a little bit more, I don't know, old school.

01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:02.460
Yeah, maybe.

01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:04.940
Or I just, I just need to play maybe with the joy cons.

01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:05.340
I don't know.

01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:07.500
Or just maybe not be in the same posture.

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:10.140
I was living in a different place back then and had a completely different setup.

01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:11.740
So maybe that's all I needed, you know?

01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:14.220
So, or not don't stream at this time.

01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.940
Cause that also changes my posture and probably not for the better.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:21.340
So pretty atrocious stream posture.

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:21.840
Yeah.

01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:22.300
Yeah.

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.860
And I've, I've found I've not been streaming as much and I don't know.

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:25.660
I gotta be honest.

01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:26.540
I don't know what it is.

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:27.500
I need to get back into it.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:32.380
I have project ideas stewing in my mind, but, um, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't mean

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:33.740
shit until I put it on paper.

01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:39.900
So I also need to talk to you about something with another streamer slash podcaster for

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:40.620
later.

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:41.580
Yeah, I'd be interested.

01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:42.080
All right.

01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:45.980
Anyway, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and, and

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:49.660
things that'll come sooner than any of those projects, because these are this week.

01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:51.900
So let's talk about release dates in the U S Loki.

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:54.540
And let's remember it is April.

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:56.220
So don't expect much.

01:28:56.220 --> 01:29:05.180
Uh, we've got, we've got, uh, 13 sentinels, uh, GS rim on Nintendo switch.

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:12.140
Uh, nobody saves the world on an intense switch PlayStation four and PlayStation five and

01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:14.700
tormented souls on Nintendo switch.

01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:20.220
That's it going to the Nintendo switch in Japan and checking out the releases this week.

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:22.380
Uh, very similar to what Loki was saying.

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:26.460
Cause that 13 sentinels ages rim is also out in Japan this week on the 12th.

01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:31.180
And then on the 14th, you have battle spirits, connected battles, skull, the hero slayer

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:35.900
in a regular and deluxe edition, uh, and the Smurfs mission belief.

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:38.220
That is an actual game that's coming out.

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:42.780
I have no, is, does it, is there a movie or something that I'm unaware of?

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.300
No, it looks like it's based on the cartoon.

01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:45.020
Interesting.

01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:49.900
I'm sure that was released here and can't imagine it wasn't on my radar, but it wasn't

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:51.580
now here's the game.

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:53.100
That's important.

01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:57.420
That's out on the switch this week, winning post nine 2022.

01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:57.900
That's right.

01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:00.140
Horse racing back on the switch this week.

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:05.500
And this is a lovely idea of a, uh, a concept of a game that probably isn't coming out here.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:09.180
I think some of those winning post games maybe have seen the light of day over here,

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:12.140
but this one won't very few, very few.

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:13.260
This one won't.

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:17.820
So, uh, anyway, for you horse racing fans, and I know you're out there winning posts,

01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:22.300
nine, the official from Koei Tecmo is out this week on the switch now quickly.

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:23.660
Let's look at the PlayStation five.

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:29.980
I can't believe it, but, uh, winning post is not a PlayStation five game.

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:33.980
It's not pushing the graphical, uh, what can be done.

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:40.300
So, uh, but we do have grand theft auto five gets a Japanese release this week on the PlayStation

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.180
five in Japan.

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.380
So that's neat.

01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:46.780
Um, and that's it for the record.

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:51.180
I did look it up and there was a game called chrono break.

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:52.060
That was trademark.

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:52.860
That was it.

01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:53.900
That was a chrono break.

01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:57.020
And it never got green lit.

01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:02.780
Um, and it's still sort of floating around there as a maybe, but the quote was that there

01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:05.420
were a lot of politics involved in creating a new game.

01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:06.460
That's where you're wrong.

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.060
They are on a chrono break.

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:09.340
So trademark.

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:09.840
Shut up.

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:15.740
And with my, with my luck, it'll be a mobile phone game at this point.

01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:17.260
And I just, I get it.

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:21.180
Did you know that there, there was kingdom heart games announced for mobile phone and

01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:23.100
you'll notice we didn't talk about them.

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:25.740
You know why we're not going to play them moving on.

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:28.300
Anyway.

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:29.020
Anyway.

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:30.540
Oh, I just, I'm sorry.

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.820
It's quickly, quickly in Japan.

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:32.620
I did need to say.

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:37.020
Winning post nine is out on the PlayStation four.

01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:38.140
Just not the PlayStation five.

01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:40.300
Very important footnote.

01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.220
You may proceed with the UK.

01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:44.060
All right.

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:48.300
So on the 12th, we have grand theft auto five for PlayStation and Xbox.

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:52.380
Epic chef for those and the switch on the 12th.

01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:58.620
Also 13 sentinels Aegis rim on the switch for the 14th tormented souls for switch.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:31:59.900
And that's it.

01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:04.380
If Epic chef, isn't Gordon Ramsey, cussing me out.

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:07.180
Then it's not, it's not an Epic chef.

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.380
That's an angry chef.

01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:11.500
He's just passionate.

01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.460
But they only nice to the kids.

01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:18.860
Yeah, I was going to say, but then when you watch the master chef kids, he's like the

01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:21.900
nicest fucking person, which you, you know, it's all an act.

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:23.660
All that stuff on hell's kitchen is an act.

01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:25.100
I'm sure he's a nice guy.

01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:30.300
My, my favorite scene though, is with the lady that won the, the blind lady that won

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:38.940
and him demonstrating how good her pie turned out and using the sound of it and the texture.

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:43.020
Can you hear that your pie is done?

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:47.980
It's in, and she was all crying and happy, but that's like, still like my favorite moment

01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:52.860
of how he is as a passionate cook and encouraging people to be their best.

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:55.980
Yeah, I think he, I think he's a nice guy deep down, but let's be real.

01:32:56.620 --> 01:33:01.900
A lot of us watch for his persona on kitchen nightmares, which is very different.

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:02.620
He just doesn't take shit.

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:04.940
Exactly.

01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:05.900
I like Gordon Ramsey.

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:09.900
I think he's a, he's a little saturated at this point.

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:12.220
Like how many shows is that man on seriously?

01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:17.500
But then honestly, again, I went to the hell's kitchen restaurant in Vegas, not this recent

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:22.380
time, but when I was there a few years ago, pre pandemic, and I will say that was one

01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:23.820
of the fucking best meals I've ever had.

01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:25.020
So, you know what?

01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:28.380
He fucking walks the walk as far as I'm concerned.

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:29.820
So have at it.

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:33.180
I still would rather go to a Morimoto restaurant first.

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.140
Yeah.

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:35.500
DJ Rama S points this out.

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:41.900
Rob, there was an episode where chef Ramsey yelled at someone, that person had an anxiety

01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:42.540
attack.

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:46.060
He took the person aside and spoke to him and calmed him down.

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:48.940
Like that's like, yeah, that sounds very Gordon Ramsey.

01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:50.620
Again, that's how you know it's an act.

01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:53.580
Like Gordon Ramsey should probably win an Oscar.

01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:58.700
I mean, I know Oscars aren't for TV shows, especially reality shows, but daytime, the

01:33:58.700 --> 01:33:59.420
daytime is yes.

01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:02.940
Gordon Ramsey should probably win a daytime Emmy for a lot of his performance.

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:03.740
Let's be real.

01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:04.860
He should win an Emmy.

01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:11.820
I know, um, the Emmy cannot get the amazing race and survivor or no it's drag race.

01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:17.900
Now like Ru Paul has won that Emmy for like seven years and this may shock you.

01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:21.420
I think it's time to stop giving Ru Paul the Emmy for that show.

01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:23.180
Like it's, it's time.

01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:25.180
It's time for Ru Paul to stop.

01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:29.340
It's, it's time for that show to, to, you know, I, I like the talent.

01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:31.180
If you're going to do anything, bring back Drag U.

01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:31.580
Yeah.

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:34.380
But anyway, it's time to give the Emmy to Gordon Ramsey.

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:37.180
Lady Bunny has a wig to support.

01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:37.680
Okay.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:39.840
All right.

01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:41.100
Moving on.

01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:42.940
Um, let's see.

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:43.980
Oh, more now.

01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:44.780
Here's the thing.

01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:46.860
Well, we, here's the thing.

01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:48.620
It's the show about video games.

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:52.380
But when I talk about video games, when Loki talks about Dark Star talks about videos,

01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:55.740
we don't, we don't have nearly the chat lighting up this much.

01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.940
We talk about Gordon Ramsey and now y'all got something to say.

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:01.900
It's just interesting.

01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:03.020
I guess we just have to do that.

01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:04.300
I guess so.

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:04.780
I know.

01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:06.700
Yeah, we've, we've way overdue on that.

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:07.200
Sorry guys.

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:13.340
Jason says there was a shot of Ramsey and someone else at a Vegas Golden Knights, the hockey team.

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:16.780
See, if you're in, if you're anywhere near San Jose, you don't acknowledge the Golden

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:17.100
Knights.

01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:17.500
That's the thing.

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:18.140
All right.

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:22.540
His smile was unlike any I've ever seen on him, on his shows.

01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:25.260
Each Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, UK and US.

01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:28.780
He's, he's because he's playing that guy on TV.

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:35.420
Phoenix 7726 says it's time for that show to sashay away.

01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:36.140
Absolutely.

01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:40.700
Phoenix says Gordon is huge on Twitch for some reason.

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:45.260
I, I have seen, I don't know how many Dead by Daylight streamers who will watch clips

01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:48.220
of Kitchen Nightmares while they're waiting 30 minutes for their match.

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:51.100
So it's just a weird thing.

01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:51.900
All right.

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:54.060
Anyway, moving on.

01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:54.300
Yes.

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.140
And regarding OLR foodie.

01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:57.580
We all know why it was delayed.

01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:00.140
I'm ready to do the show again.

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:02.300
Like a lot has changed since October.

01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:02.800
Okay.

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:04.460
But now the problem.

01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:08.300
There's been lots of stuff going on.

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:10.220
Not with, with I think all of us, so.

01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:11.260
Oh, for sure.

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:16.460
But, um, uh, I was going to say the only problem now is that we're not going to have dark soccer

01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:18.700
next week and we're not going to have Loki in two weeks.

01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:21.660
So at this point, I can't promise foodie Oh, until may.

01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:23.020
And that's just a scheduling thing.

01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:25.580
Cause everybody's got other stuff going on, which is legit.

01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:29.340
Everybody's allowed to have a vacay every now and then I just went to Las Vegas.

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:31.420
I just happened to not be there on an OLR night.

01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:33.020
I wish mine were big.

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:37.820
Well, if you want to tell them, tell them, but otherwise we're just going to gloss over

01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:38.780
it like I've been doing.

01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:39.660
All right.

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.260
Remember that stone?

01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:43.420
It didn't go anywhere.

01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:43.820
All right.

01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:49.660
I, I, I got to, I got to send them the troops, you know, physically remove it.

01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:50.780
You said it, not me.

01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.220
So, um, there you go.

01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:55.900
That's the mystery, mystery, mystery solved.

01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:59.820
Your yours wasn't as little and cute invasive as that though.

01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.820
No, I was awake.

01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:03.900
So, all right.

01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:08.620
Well, obviously Loki, we're all thinking of you through that, um, crappy scenario there.

01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:09.820
Wishing you the best.

01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:15.420
I mean, you seem in good spirits, all things, you will be fine, but it's, it's, it's, it's

01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:18.220
like when my gallbladder came out, I knew I was going to be fine.

01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:20.060
It's just fucking annoying.

01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:21.900
The whole process is annoying.

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:24.540
Being out of commission for two weeks is annoying.

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:25.500
All of it is annoying.

01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:31.980
All of my, all of my laparoscopies, like my last two surgeries that I had other than my

01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:33.820
knee, I was happy.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:36.540
I was happy to be out of commission.

01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:38.220
I'm like, I'm on my couch.

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:39.900
No one's bothering me.

01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:41.420
This is great.

01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:44.060
All right.

01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.020
Uh, let's move on.

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:48.060
We still have some shifts, some non Gordon Ramsey topics to get to.

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.180
Let's get to that.

01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:51.020
Well, maybe Gordon Ramsey could show up in this.

01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:51.500
I don't know.

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:53.660
Loki, uh, what do you think about this next story?

01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:56.940
I mean, they have everything, so why not?

01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:04.700
Um, so Epic games has, uh, partnered with, uh, Lego on a new project that they say, well,

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:09.660
and they drop metaverse into their pitch or whatever.

01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:16.940
Um, so to me, it sounds like, you know, Roblox, but just licensable.

01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:22.380
So, you know, whereas Roblox made something that looked very similar to Lego, but not

01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:31.100
quite what this is basically Lego, but you know, Lego, um, neat be cool to see what they

01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:31.660
come up with.

01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:32.460
I love Lego.

01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:39.820
So, you know, and after all, as I pointed out to Rob on Twitter, they have, uh, the

01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:41.580
little, what do they call those?

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:49.820
Um, uh, gosh, um, the minifigures, it's not minifigs, but they're like the, uh, the brick

01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:50.300
heads.

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:52.060
So they have the brick heads for the spice girls.

01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:55.660
Now I saw that because they had the Muppets too is a thing.

01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:56.220
Oh, they do.

01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:59.340
Yeah, at least I'm pretty sure I saw that on like Twitter or something.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:05.340
So yeah, I definitely want those spice girls went, but I'm like, Lego is that addiction.

01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:10.300
I've been somehow able to stave off this whole time, even through the Mario's and all that.

01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:16.380
It's, and it's one of those things I'm like, they have that, the Nintendo 64, uh, was it

01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:20.700
Mario 64, uh, the question block base.

01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:24.540
They have that a target and I keep, I keep passing by it every time because it's like

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:25.660
$170.

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:27.660
I'm like, yeah, block really.

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.460
Some somebody question block.

01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:32.460
It's like, you know, that, that big or whatever.

01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:37.180
And then it folds out into a bunch of the different, like it's a micro scale world of

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:39.100
like the different levels and stuff.

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:44.220
Well, somebody actually have a Lego Fiat kit that I haven't put together yet.

01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:50.940
Somebody just brought into this house, um, some shelves, which was very kind and nice.

01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:54.380
And it's perfect for showing off Legos to be quite honest.

01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:56.780
If no, it's, it's made for cats.

01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:57.180
Yeah.

01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:00.700
If I wasn't worried about the cats, I'm not worried about smoosh as much.

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:03.740
Cause he's kind of too stupid to get past the first level.

01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:08.700
But cheddar, I'm noticing like just in the short time we've had cheddar, I'm absolutely

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:14.060
noticing he will find the highest point in the room to climb up to and look down upon

01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:14.940
the rest of you.

01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.460
That is absolutely cheddars mo.

01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:17.500
He's that kind of cat.

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:20.780
So the minute that shelving came in, I was like, Oh God cheddar.

01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:22.540
I'm not going to be able to put anything on these shelves.

01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:25.660
Cause cheddar is going to run up to the top immediately.

01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:29.660
I will be able to put things on the shelves when I met him on the top of your closet.

01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:33.020
I'll just have to get little, um, like cover.

01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:37.740
I know Ikea has like coverings that can go over them so that he can't like actually knock

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:38.620
things over in them.

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:40.220
So like clear doors, basically.

01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:47.100
You can also like, if you were going to put like things on display, like, I don't know

01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:51.100
why trophies are coming to my mind, but just, you know, using that as an example or like

01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:56.220
figures or things you can, um, get Velcro for the bottom of them.

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:56.780
Hmm.

01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:57.500
That's a good idea.

01:40:58.140 --> 01:40:59.100
I want a trophy.

01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:01.340
I haven't had a trophy in a long time.

01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:07.180
For all the podcasts award right in front of me, but the Midna doesn't get up there

01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:10.620
for all the, she doesn't get anywhere that there's not food for all the jokes people

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:13.180
make about participation trophies and then to stay in age.

01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:13.980
Where's my trophy?

01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:14.940
I don't have a trophy.

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:15.100
Yeah.

01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:19.180
We have a podcast award, but dark soccer, you've, you've, you've taken custody of that

01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:20.060
and that's fine.

01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:21.580
You were the one that went down.

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:23.100
I was like, you went down and got in person.

01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:23.740
It's only fair.

01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:24.620
I get it.

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:27.020
Um, but do they still do those?

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:30.220
Uh, they do, but it's changed a lot over the years.

01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:34.540
We kind of corporate, no, it's just at some point you had to pay to be in them and I'm

01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:35.900
just not interested in that.

01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:36.540
Yeah.

01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:41.900
So, um, most award shows are like these days anyways that you have to like pay for the

01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:42.940
privilege or whatever.

01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:43.900
Yeah.

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:46.540
I'm just, it's, that's not the kind of thing that interests me.

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:49.900
I just, I would, I love people being here live on Sunday.

01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:52.700
And listening to the podcast throughout the week.

01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:54.540
I don't, I don't need no word for that.

01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:55.900
It was nice to win that award.

01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:56.540
It was more than nice.

01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:57.500
It was lovely.

01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.660
Um, especially because it was the first year.

01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:00.300
It was nice.

01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:00.940
It was a surprise.

01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:01.180
Yeah.

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:01.820
It kind of was.

01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:04.620
Um, and uh, yeah, yeah.

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:05.980
Bonsovo six is wait, we got a trophy.

01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:06.060
Yeah.

01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:06.780
We won the pot.

01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:12.300
We won the very first podcast award in 2005 for best gaming podcast.

01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:19.180
So believe, believe it or not, uh, this, this, this was the best one.

01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:20.780
At that time.

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:26.940
So anyway, uh, let's move on.

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.580
Uh, let's talk about this story, dark soccer.

01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:34.300
So, um, y'all remember missed, right?

01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:38.140
You know, pointy, clicky adventure, pretty place.

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:40.620
Um, yeah, now it's a mini golf game.

01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:49.100
So there, uh, so it's going to be a DLC pack for a VR.

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.420
Golf game called walkabout mini golf.

01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:58.700
Um, and it will be available on meta quest and steam VR developed by, uh, mighty coconut.

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:04.860
So you too can shoot balls around in the world of mist.

01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.300
They also have a course based on labyrinth,

01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:13.100
which would give me some minor incentive to actually play that except VR.

01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:17.660
Yeah, I check out the golf thing for sure.

01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:18.460
That sounds fun.

01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:19.980
All right.

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:23.820
Uh, well, whereas I would be interested in playing that, let's be real.

01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:26.220
I'm never going to be interested in playing this next game, but we're gonna talk about

01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:26.700
it anyway.

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:29.900
Cause it's fun to dunk on this company.

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:30.380
Loki.

01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:33.740
Yes.

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:34.620
Yes.

01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:36.300
So we've gotten to that point.

01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:39.020
I guess it's, it's, you know, in the stage of stages.

01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:41.180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:42.300
We've been in that point.

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:46.380
We've bought a house in that point where we're sending our mail from that point.

01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:51.260
And it's being, uh, uh, self-addressed stamped with you are here at the point.

01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:53.740
Yeah.

01:43:53.740 --> 01:44:00.940
So, uh, Konami, uh, recently made a comment, uh, regarding their updates to E football.

01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:01.180
Yes.

01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:03.420
Remember that's still a game barely.

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:09.660
Um, basically saying that we've entered what would be eventually a two year period of developing

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:11.740
for E football 2022.

01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:16.460
However, we were too focused on getting the game out on time that we lost sight of the

01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:19.340
most important thing quality.

01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:26.460
Naturally, we were met with critical reviews from rightfully disappointing fans.

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:32.780
And there's no, like, I don't see any assertion that we won't do this again.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:39.340
No, you know, since we're talking about searching that they won't do that.

01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:40.780
Since we're talking about trophies.

01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:44.460
Why don't we get a, you try.

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:45.100
Why no, no.

01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:49.500
Why don't we make Konami a trophy that says literally the dumbest thing that's ever happened

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:53.660
in gaming and send it to their office and see what happens.

01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:00.460
Like, is it to have like worst decision making ever?

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:01.660
Is it, is it petty?

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:02.940
Yes.

01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:04.300
Am I above that?

01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:05.180
No, no.

01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:09.820
When it comes to Konami, are we, are we at that point?

01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:10.220
Yes.

01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:12.540
I've already, I've already explained this to everybody.

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:18.220
We're at that point where Konami is that just the, the board that is running Konami.

01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:21.500
It could, it could not be run by worse people.

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:26.380
Like if Elon Musk bought Konami, I'd actually be like, you know what?

01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:27.420
Maybe they'll be okay.

01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:31.420
Like, I, I don't see.

01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:35.020
Well, maybe the other guy that Loki talked about would actually somehow be worse for

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:35.420
Konami.

01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:38.940
So I'm not going to joke about that, but Elon Musk, I will joke about.

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:42.620
And most people getting in and stepping about Konami, I will joke about.

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:45.420
And that would probably be better for that company at the end of the day.

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:53.020
S2100 Matt says there should be a segment called this week and Konami dunking on itself.

01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:53.740
Yeah, pretty much.

01:45:54.620 --> 01:46:00.540
Questbuster says, if anyone had doubts, whether Konami was past caring, eFootball is there

01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:04.060
to remind them that yes, we are not the company you remember in your childhood.

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:05.260
That is correct.

01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:06.300
That is correct.

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:12.540
At this point, the best we can hope for is that when Sony said, hi, we're going to give

01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:17.340
you money for nothing to put games on service, Konami signed off on that.

01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:23.260
And we will have sweet code and one, two, three, four, and five all on this PlayStation

01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:25.500
plus thing.

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:31.740
Cause I'm telling you right now, if one of those games is missing, that is exactly where

01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:37.260
the Kotaku Ardo will be out in five minutes about how that game is missing from PlayStation

01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:43.340
plus, sweet code and four, not on PlayStation plus PlayStation plus major oversights does

01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:44.540
not have sweet code and five.

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:54.380
I'm telling you right now, if Sony does not have those games on the service, don't bother.

01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:56.780
Don't bother.

01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:01.500
Anyway, let's see.

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.300
What else do we have?

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:07.020
Oh yes, actually this is, this is somewhat big news for the last story, but I think it's

01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:11.900
one of those things where we, we as gaming consumers don't really see the result of this

01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:19.180
for some time, but the unreal five engine has been officially released.

01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:24.780
It has been an early access for a year, but this last week, Epic games officially released

01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:26.540
UE5 to developers.

01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:32.940
Of course, some may remember the matrix awakens tech demo to show a little bit of what UE5

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:33.900
can actually do.

01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:39.980
Which, you know, it looked really good and I think we're kind of excited to see what

01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:40.540
it can produce.

01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:48.060
But you know, the actual games that come from this probably won't be out for a little while

01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:51.020
because studios have only really had a year to play with it.

01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:56.300
For instance, black myth, wukong, which was one of the first announced unreal engine five

01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:56.860
games.

01:47:56.860 --> 01:47:58.620
That's not out until 2023.

01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:03.260
The next Witcher game, ha keep on waiting.

01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:06.780
We do know though, a new Tomb Raider game.

01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.940
I mean, of course they're going to make a new Tomb Raider game.

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.140
Why wouldn't they make a new Tomb Raider game?

01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:13.740
It'd be ridiculous if they didn't make a new Tomb Raider game, but we know that the next

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:17.420
Tomb Raider game is going to be on unreal engine five because it was actually announced

01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:23.660
on the official Tomb Raider account in a tweet that said crystal dynamics is incredibly excited

01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:27.500
about the future of unreal and how it will help us take our storytelling to the next

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:28.060
level.

01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:32.220
That's why we're proud to announce that our next Tomb Raider game is being built on unreal

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:32.860
engine five.

01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:34.780
Hey, you know what?

01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:40.460
I'm ready to see it because the Tomb Raider reboots from God, that series probably started

01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:41.740
almost 10 years ago at this point.

01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:42.860
What was the Tomb Raider reboot?

01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:44.220
That was like 2013, wasn't it?

01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:49.900
So the Lara Croft and the no good, terrible, terrible, very bad day.

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.340
Yeah, that whole trilogy.

01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:56.380
You know, I mean, those already looked really good for its time.

01:48:56.380 --> 01:49:00.540
Imagining that in unreal engine five, I think those games are going to be fire.

01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:07.500
Now, I know the Avengers, a lot of people believe was a misstep for crystal dynamics.

01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:13.420
I have a feeling there's a little bit of too many cooks in the kitchen going on with that.

01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:19.020
And, you know, hopefully with the next Tomb Raider, people kind of back off and let crystal

01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:20.460
dynamics do the game they want to do.

01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:23.020
And hopefully that'll be nice.

01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:31.260
So rep cycled is in our chat over twitch.tv slash fog network saying UE five engine looking

01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:32.220
shiny so far.

01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:33.740
Height.

01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:35.740
Yeah, I'm excited to see what comes out of this.

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:41.820
Loki, you didn't make a game in unreal engine, though, but you've messed around with it,

01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:42.380
right?

01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:43.260
I have.

01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:46.540
Yeah, I have time to car with before you canceled.

01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:48.460
It was in that was unity.

01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:49.660
No, that was unity.

01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:57.020
I did I did a mop type game in unreal to try to learn it.

01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:05.740
And I for me, it was that because I don't really know C++ or I haven't worked in C++

01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:05.980
too much.

01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:10.940
So I tried using their blueprints and blueprints are all right, but it's very cumbersome to

01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:14.460
do things, but I got it to work and it was all right.

01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.980
It was just kind of learning it.

01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:18.620
Yeah, so yeah.

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:19.120
All right.

01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:22.940
Well, that's all the slated stories we have for tonight.

01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:26.140
We'll check in in a year and see what games come out for unreal.

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:26.380
Yeah.

01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:29.660
Well, I actually wanted to bring it.

01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:33.020
It's not really an unreal five, but it is unreal.

01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:34.300
You know, four point two five.

01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:34.540
Sure.

01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:40.620
Did you see the PTB with the Haddonfield rework for Dead by Daylight?

01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:43.340
No, I've seen the screen.

01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:46.300
The still screenshots, but I haven't seen people playing on the map.

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:51.100
I saw I was watching LC play it the other day.

01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:53.260
It's really good.

01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:53.980
It looks nice.

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:57.580
And the Legion music is really good.

01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:03.180
Like to explain to people who don't play, all of the killers have like their own chase

01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:05.260
music, but Legion is actually four people.

01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:08.780
And so each of them have their own chase music.

01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:14.300
If you play, they have like a standard chase music, but each of them has an add on that's

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.420
like their own mix tape.

01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:17.900
And when you do that, it changes up the music.

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:22.780
And then if you do two of their mix tapes as your add ons, then it really changes the

01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:23.100
music.

01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:24.940
It's called like the frantic mix tape.

01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:27.900
And it's pretty darn good.

01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:31.740
I have to say it was a very clever idea and something worth noting.

01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:35.260
Yeah, I know they're reworking that killer and they're reworking Ghostface.

01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:39.020
Not from the screen movies seemed really cool.

01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:42.140
A lot of people who weren't Legion fans said that they were suddenly really fun.

01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:42.380
Yeah.

01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:47.660
And then the Haddonfield map, because the very first, you know, Dead by Daylight is

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:50.060
kind of known at this point as like the multiverse of horror.

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:50.780
Right.

01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:58.060
But the very first license that game got that started the dam break was Halloween, Michael

01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:59.740
Myers and Laurie Strode.

01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:03.260
So that Haddonfield map is as old as the game, pretty much.

01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:05.740
Yeah, that was the first licensed level.

01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:06.220
Yeah.

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:06.700
Yeah.

01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:07.100
Yeah.

01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:11.420
So they're totally redoing it now because that, you know, over the years, it just with

01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:14.860
all the new perks, the new talents, the new things that new characters get, that map

01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:17.180
starts to show its problems on how the new talent.

01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:19.260
So they're completely redo because they got rid of the basement.

01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:20.540
Didn't they in that map?

01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.940
Not not the basement basement, but like the fake basement.

01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:24.700
No.

01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:25.740
Oh, I heard they got rid of it.

01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:26.780
The basement still there.

01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:27.340
Oh, okay.

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:27.740
Interesting.

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:28.700
Oh, I'm curious.

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:29.580
From what I remember.

01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:33.340
But also, the houses have furniture.

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.020
Yeah, it looks nice.

01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:35.740
It was really nice.

01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:41.180
Before though, the thing that made that map kind of cool is that all of the like

01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:44.060
artwork on the walls were actually concept drawings.

01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:46.160
So.

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:53.580
I found out another thing that the entirety of the Hawkins Laboratory is still in the game files.

01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:57.580
I still think they should try to repurpose it somehow,

01:52:57.580 --> 01:53:01.020
but maybe just legally, it's probably impossible at this point.

01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:05.820
I think they should make it the recording studio for the all kill chapter, but.

01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:06.320
Yeah.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:09.660
Didn't mean to derail, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:10.300
No, it's fine.

01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:15.420
Well, usually we get to derail because when I go to the mailbag and it's empty, we derail,

01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:18.460
which I believe our mailbag is empty this week, but I could be wrong.

01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:18.780
It is.

01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:20.300
So I was proactively derailing.

01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:21.500
All right, that's fine.

01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:25.340
Participate at orangeslaundry.com if you want to send us an email

01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:28.540
on any topic, whether we did or we didn't talk about it.

01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:30.460
I would also usually talk about Drag Race here.

01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:36.860
I don't think Dark Soccer is watching, but there's spoiler alert for this week's Drag Race.

01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:43.100
Sorry, there's a top five this year because in this season we don't eliminate people.

01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:45.260
So five girls got to the end.

01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:47.580
So I was going to ask if you have a fave.

01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:49.020
How do they get rid of people?

01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:54.540
No, they have been getting rid of people, but it's so like there was a double save this week.

01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:56.860
A chocolate bar saved somebody this week.

01:53:56.860 --> 01:53:59.820
There was a, um, they didn't get rid of somebody.

01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:01.580
Twist every round, right?

01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:05.740
They're stretching it out as long as possible to get more episodes out of it so they can

01:54:05.740 --> 01:54:07.980
charge more when the show is inevitably syndicated.

01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:10.460
That's what they're doing.

01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:13.740
But anyway, um, so, so there's a top five.

01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:16.060
They didn't want to eliminate any of the bottom two this last week.

01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:18.700
So Willow Pill and, uh, Angeria were in the bottom two.

01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:23.900
Of course they were because they're friends and, uh, both made it through to the finale.

01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:26.700
So I'm, I'm curious if Dark Soccer has a fave.

01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:28.220
Our local girl is still in it.

01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:30.460
Lady Camden is in the finals.

01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:31.580
I haven't watched any of it.

01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:32.140
Oh, okay.

01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:37.900
I like Willow Pill, but I kind of have to root for the local one, even if, um, she's local.

01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:41.900
Well, she lives in SAC, but she performs in San Francisco.

01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:44.780
So I, I, she, she really, Oh, Lady Camden.

01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:45.980
Okay.

01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:46.220
Yeah.

01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:51.100
So, which I, I did not know that name before Drag Race because I think she performs in

01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:52.380
the Bay Area that much.

01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:54.460
Um, but she's, I think I might've seen her at Hamburger Mary's.

01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:56.940
Oh, fuck.

01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:58.300
Maybe I did too, actually.

01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:00.620
Now that you say that.

01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:02.700
Now that you say that vaguely familiar.

01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:04.060
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:04.620
All right.

01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:10.540
Anyway, so, um, she, she's, I would, she's kind of the front runner.

01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:15.980
I think a lot of the fans kind of want Willow Pill, but I, she's, she's won like three challenges.

01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:22.140
So we, we may have a Sacramento girl actually win fucking Drag Race this year, which is wild to me.

01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:23.580
So I know.

01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:23.980
Right.

01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:24.620
Yeah.

01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:25.020
All right.

01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:26.620
Anyway, um, let's move on.

01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:30.300
Maybe we can actually see some of our friends who perform in Sacramento up.

01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:31.500
That would be nice.

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:31.980
That'd be nice.

01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:32.700
There's some girls here.

01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:33.660
I'd love to see on the show.

01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:38.460
Um, uh, moving on, let's actually, Dragula is the one I want to see.

01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:45.580
I yeah, there's like, I can't say I have seen land insider perform and it was amazing.

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:52.620
There's, I'm, I'm, I am completely biased because I've hosted these people numerous times,

01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:55.500
but I would love to see like Chris front is here locally.

01:55:55.500 --> 01:56:00.220
I would love to see them on the, on, and red fulfill, I think would be incredible and regular.

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:01.820
So shout out to my locals.

01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:08.220
So anyway, um, moving on, let's, uh, let's get into other stuff.

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:09.340
Last minute stories.

01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:10.220
Loki, you have anything?

01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:14.140
No, it's that kind of week, huh?

01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:17.020
I'm just reading up on the, the more in television.

01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:18.860
More drama.

01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:19.420
Great.

01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:20.540
Well, just the same.

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:28.300
It's so I think there's still, they have, uh, uh, I don't know where I think it's from

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:32.620
Twitter or something, or maybe even one of like a feedback in one of their fundings that

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:38.060
they were doing, but basically saying that, Hey, you know, that, that, um, galaxy purple

01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:43.420
that was exclusive, the GameStop, well, now you can pre-order that, uh, through the television

01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:48.300
Mico site, because it's no longer going to be getting some exclusive because they may

01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.660
not even be carrying it.

01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:51.420
What?

01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:54.540
Cause, cause that's why they canceled the orders.

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:57.820
So, uh, I just think that it's absolutely silly.

01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:01.820
That they're still taking pre-orders on it, even though they know that it's not coming.

01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:02.060
Yeah.

01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:07.900
Well, I'm still holding out hope that I get one because at this point it's a collector's

01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:08.540
item.

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:12.300
I don't, even if it's the showgirls of gaming consoles, I don't care.

01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:14.700
Like I it's, it's a collector's item.

01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:16.060
You you'll laugh at me now.

01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:20.220
And then in 10 years you'll want to play it like, so laugh away.

01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:20.860
Ha ha ha.

01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:21.980
All right.

01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:27.660
Anyway, uh, let's see, go into some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash a Vogue

01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:31.660
and network, uh, bonds, double a six saying a dead by daylight on the unreal five engine

01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:35.660
for couch, local co-op, you know, there's going to come a point where that they're going

01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:36.940
to have to remake that game.

01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:40.620
Basically, they're going to have to, cause we all, the, the longest running joke in the

01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:44.460
community is that it's spaghetti coated to hell.

01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:47.740
That like it's, it's being held together with duct tape at this point.

01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:52.220
Um, they changed, they change a graphic somewhere over here and a killer ability breaks.

01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:53.500
It's it's wild.

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:56.860
So, um, they're going to need to redo that game from scratch at some point.

01:57:56.860 --> 01:58:02.300
I don't know if that means dead by daylight too, or what that is, but, um, yeah, uh, bonds

01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:06.780
double six is also saying 2024 is too soon for an unreal game.

01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:09.100
Somebody had brought up a like unreal tournament.

01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:11.660
Uh, give me unreal tournament 2025.

01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:13.820
Now they have three years, even a damn demo.

01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:17.260
Well, I will probably start seeing the UE five stuff.

01:58:17.260 --> 01:58:20.860
You know, you'll see indie stuff probably sooner rather than later, but I think you'll

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:23.420
see the real oomph from that engine.

01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:25.820
Uh, probably, you know, start to see it next year.

01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:30.380
You know, um, rumor is that kingdom hearts four is going to be in UE five.

01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:34.700
So, you know, you'll see that hypothetically someday.

01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:41.020
Your grandkids might the next generation.

01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:42.220
All right.

01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:42.720
Anyway.

01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:43.920
All right.

01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:47.260
Well, with that, we're out of material.

01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:48.860
We're at the end.

01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:49.420
C'est la fin.

01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:51.100
Anybody else have anything?

01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:56.860
Um, um, marathon Thursday.

01:58:56.860 --> 01:58:57.360
Yes.

01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:58.140
Hang out with me.

01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:00.940
And you're not going to be here for the next OLR because you're out of town.

01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:01.980
I'll eat a whole cake.

01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:05.500
I'll be fine.

01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:05.980
I'll come say hi.

01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:13.980
Yeah, I'm not going to be here, uh, cause that is the day that I am, uh, driving to,

01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:16.140
uh, stay with Marissa.

01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:18.540
Tell her I said hi.

01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:19.180
I miss her.

01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:19.980
I miss her.

01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:21.500
I will.

01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:23.260
I miss Marissa too.

01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:24.380
That'd be great.

01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:24.860
Have fun.

01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:27.660
You're going to Disney, right?

01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:28.780
Or did that change?

01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:30.540
Yeah, I'm going to Disneyland.

01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:37.660
I'm also meeting up with, uh, with, uh, our streamer friends, uh, Nick and Prince and

01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:39.820
hopefully Nathan and hopefully Isaaco.

01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:40.380
That's great.

01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:41.260
Tell them all I said hi.

01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:43.180
I sure will.

01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:44.620
Awesome.

01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:45.100
Awesome.

01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:46.220
You get some comments from chat.

01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:49.180
Bonds double six is tell Marissa I said hello as well.

01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:52.540
So let Marissa know the chatters are thinking of her.

01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:54.700
Marissa, our chat says hi and they miss you.

01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:57.900
All right.

01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:00.460
Um, that is, that is it.

02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:01.260
That's going to do it.

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:04.140
So, uh, let's wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:07.100
Oh, before I do that, of course, I want to thank you guys as always for listening to

02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:07.820
orange launch radio.

02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:11.340
Thank you for being here, participating with our show, even on a short week that was a

02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:12.300
little lighter on the news.

02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:12.860
What can you do?

02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:13.740
It's April.

02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:16.700
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:19.820
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if

02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:21.420
the voices aren't here to put out on air.

02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:24.460
So, uh, help us grow our community.

02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:27.420
Uh, spread the word about vog network here on Twitch.

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:31.420
A follow goes an awful long way and we really appreciate those follows.

02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:32.140
So what was that?

02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:36.220
Make my monster grow, make my monster grow.

02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:37.740
Uh, that's it.

02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:41.020
Um, join our discord vog network.com slash discord.

02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:42.940
Talk to us throughout the week.

02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:44.540
Uh, submit story ideas.

02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:45.580
That's fabulous as well.

02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:47.820
Let's get everybody's final thoughts.

02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:49.420
We will start, of course, with dark soccer.

02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:54.940
Um, people are salty and MMR sucks.

02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:57.660
Hopefully they fix it.

02:00:57.660 --> 02:00:58.220
I'll see you on the flip side.

02:00:58.220 --> 02:00:58.860
I've been trying.

02:00:58.860 --> 02:00:59.580
All right.

02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:00.380
We'll see you in a little bit.

02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:02.940
Dark soccer, everybody.

02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:04.620
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:09.260
My final thought is also, uh, part of, I guess, the last minute story.

02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:12.860
So as I was talking about the amico stuff, um, so they did put out, I guess,

02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:18.220
an email or something to, um, people that had stuff pre-ordered and they're trying to

02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:23.820
get folks that had pre-orders at GameStop to now pre-order them directly through Intellivision.

02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:29.980
And they listed new prices for the Galaxy purple and vintage wood grain.

02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:34.620
They went three, three 39 99 for a console with two controllers,

02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:37.660
two 89 99 for console with one controller.

02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:40.940
And they're not taking any pre-orders right now on black or the white systems.

02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:46.460
So it sounds like they're trying to end.

02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:51.740
Apparently folks that have tried to request a refund on their, um, pre-orders have gotten

02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:52.620
no money back.

02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:58.860
They say right now, though, um, that they're not taking for all new orders going forward.

02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:03.740
No deposit will be required until we finalize and announce a manufacturing date.

02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:10.780
Um, but for all those who did already pre-order, you know, with a deposit, yeah, you can get

02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:11.180
that back.

02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:14.300
Great.

02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:19.020
Again, when am I going to learn this Kickstarter lesson?

02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:19.500
I don't know.

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:20.620
All right.

02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:28.380
My final thought for tonight is what on earth am I going to do with 16 shiny mudkips?

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:31.820
What am I going to do with 16 shiny mudkips?

02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:34.780
Now granted question for Shane.

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:38.940
Well, I caught like three of them the first time, but I caught like a loop.

02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:43.340
I caught too many today and I only played for like an hour and a half.

02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:44.700
I just walked around the Capitol.

02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:45.340
That was it.

02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:47.260
Gosh.

02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:47.660
Wow.

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:49.420
And in chat, they're like, I only got five tail.

02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:50.300
I only got four day.

02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:54.060
Oh no, I could barely play the first mudkip day today.

02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:55.980
I got 12.

02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:58.620
I got 12 today.

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:02.380
All zero stars.

02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:06.620
Oh, I only got, I had a three star from the first mudkip day somehow.

02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:10.940
So that's the one I've kind of been investing all the candy in, but I don't have any stardust.

02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:12.460
Keep burning it anyway.

02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:12.780
Yay.

02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:13.580
Pokemon go.

02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:15.980
I'm level 53 in Pikmin though.

02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:17.180
I'm kicking that game's ass.

02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:18.060
All right.

02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:20.300
That's it, everybody.

02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:21.020
That's going to do it.

02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:22.540
Thank you again for listening to our show.
