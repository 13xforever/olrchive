WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.520
The standout story this week is Bungie pursuing fraudsters. A malicious party created fraudulent

00:14.520 --> 00:19.080
DMCA requests purporting to be Bungie's legal partner in order to take down legitimate Destiny

00:19.080 --> 00:23.200
2 content creator YouTube videos, and Bungie wants to bust those abusers. I'm in favor

00:23.200 --> 00:27.560
of the DMCA in theory, but implementing it affects nearly every party in the process,

00:27.560 --> 00:31.360
and we see nearly all of that in this story. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,

00:31.360 --> 00:34.200
Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you details on this and the rest of the week's gaming

00:34.200 --> 00:40.160
news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:40.160 --> 00:46.240
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:46.240 --> 00:53.040
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

00:53.040 --> 01:00.960
number 908 of our show for April the 3rd of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined

01:00.960 --> 01:05.160
every week here with my co-host. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.400
Oh, hi. Hi. Good to see you again.

01:08.400 --> 01:17.800
Yeah, well, I bought a $120 webcam for 45 bucks on Mercari brand new.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.560
Hooray for sales.

01:19.560 --> 01:25.920
Well, or however this person managed to get a hold of it and sell it, I asked no questions.

01:25.920 --> 01:26.920
It's a nice Logitech.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.360
Yeah, you look great. So good to see you again.

01:29.360 --> 01:35.800
It's a 1080. I mean, I prefer the 4K of my iPhone, you know, but, and the skin editor

01:35.800 --> 01:36.800
on camo.

01:36.800 --> 01:41.960
It ends up getting shrunk down to a little box when we're taping for OLR anyway.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.400
And I also realized this is going to come in handy for my marathon because my phone

01:46.400 --> 01:52.080
doesn't charge when I'm using camo. So if I'm going to be on 12 hours, I think that's

01:52.080 --> 01:53.080
going to be necessary.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.960
There you go. There you go. And of course I'm talking about some visuals because we

01:56.960 --> 02:01.000
do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice

02:01.000 --> 02:06.760
of geeks network, twitch.tv slash VOG network, VOG network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

02:06.760 --> 02:11.600
show. Also joining me on this program, say hello to tech master Loki.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.600
Hello.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
Hello.

02:13.720 --> 02:18.360
Hi, Loki. I'm trying to determine what that game is. It's a very loud, bright game. And

02:18.360 --> 02:21.520
it's not one I recognize. I feel like I should know it.

02:21.520 --> 02:30.280
Yeah, I'm trying to remember what the name was. It's something with a snail. It's, no,

02:30.280 --> 02:37.320
it's called will you snail you, but it has nothing to do with the little creatures. I

02:37.320 --> 02:40.320
don't see those in there. So that's interesting.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.840
It does. It's basically so what's kind of the unique thing about the game is you're

02:44.840 --> 02:49.760
trying it's like a speed run game, but the game has AI and will know how in will know

02:49.760 --> 02:54.600
basically what like how you play and try to trip you up based off of how you play.

02:54.600 --> 02:58.640
Okay, that's a clever mechanic. I'll give it that. Okay. All right. So it's like the

02:58.640 --> 03:03.440
anti speed runner game. I kind of like that. That's sort of good.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.800
I actually have a pretty nasty phobia of snails and slugs, right?

03:06.800 --> 03:11.240
No, yeah, yeah. But it's a very cartoon snail. It doesn't matter. I can't look at them at

03:11.240 --> 03:16.720
all. Like not even the giant racing one from the never ending story.

03:16.720 --> 03:21.760
I only remember the horse getting eaten by the lake in that one.

03:21.760 --> 03:25.600
It reminds me of like number munchress for some reason. Like, I don't know, like, or

03:25.600 --> 03:31.040
like, I don't know, something like that, like an old PC or I don't know.

03:31.040 --> 03:35.760
Yeah, it's got a retro look to it. It's like that retro. But like with modern graphic touches,

03:35.760 --> 03:39.120
it makes me think of this was in the news this week, but it's not on our show world

03:39.120 --> 03:44.160
tonight. So I can mention it. It's the the the doom. You know, that source codes everywhere,

03:44.160 --> 03:47.920
right? Because people have ported Doom from the 1990s to like run on a toaster, right?

03:47.920 --> 03:52.080
We know Doom is everywhere. Somebody got a version of that running on like race trace

03:52.080 --> 03:56.160
with like ray tracing. And that's showing up because like a lot of people are saying

03:56.160 --> 04:00.520
like, wow, it makes Doom look like a crazy like new different game. And that's kind of

04:00.520 --> 04:04.440
like what the gameplay behind you makes you think of because it's just it's a retro game,

04:04.440 --> 04:11.180
but it's got like new flashy elements to it. So sure. Yeah, yeah. So anyhow, um, let's

04:11.180 --> 04:14.720
talk a little bit about our kickoff topic tonight because we are here to talk about

04:14.720 --> 04:19.420
video games with you all in our chat room over twitch.tv slash a vog network. Bobby

04:19.420 --> 04:25.600
Blackwell is there finding the link to the game that is featured on Loki stream there.

04:25.600 --> 04:33.120
And dark soccer is mentioning the 10 ADP pro stream, writing out the tech that she's using.

04:33.120 --> 04:37.800
If you need to get a copy of that for yourself. All right. Um, let's get into tonight's kickoff

04:37.800 --> 04:44.760
topic and it can quite, uh, quite simply be put as nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,

04:44.760 --> 04:50.040
nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, hey, goodbye. Uh, e three 2022 is officially canceled. It's

04:50.040 --> 04:55.240
not happening. Um, good. I was going to come in here and do a whole, I told you so thing,

04:55.240 --> 04:59.560
but then I realized, I mean, I feel like I've been kind of saying this for a little bit,

04:59.560 --> 05:04.000
but the week where I really said like e three is not happening. And I don't know why you

05:04.000 --> 05:07.200
all keep think it is happening. It is not happening because it would have been announced

05:07.200 --> 05:12.820
by now. That was the week we ended up stopping the show 30 minutes in and it wasn't podcast.

05:12.820 --> 05:20.120
So I'm like, Oh God, gosh, darn it. The one, the one thing I doubt you cannot argue. I

05:20.120 --> 05:26.840
called it, uh, is, is lost. Yeah, this try had witnesses. A lot of life folks. I don't,

05:26.840 --> 05:31.720
I don't recall you ever saying that. Well, guess what? Guess what? I ended up saving

05:31.720 --> 05:36.320
the footage. I was going to let it cause today was the day it gets deleted cause stuff stays

05:36.320 --> 05:40.320
on Twitch for two weeks. So I was going to let it get deleted today. And I was like,

05:40.320 --> 05:45.120
ah shit. If I said that and I'm going to go to, I might as well just save it, whatever.

05:45.120 --> 05:50.520
It'll be a, a special little thing, I guess. So anyway, it's there, it's there in the archives.

05:50.520 --> 05:55.560
So that's fake news. Uh, thank you. Thank you everyone in chat

05:55.560 --> 05:59.440
for inflating my ego. Uh, Jason, our, our voiceover guy is there in chat saying, you

05:59.440 --> 06:03.320
know, what's funny. I was going to say, Rob called it in my first draft of the intro.

06:03.320 --> 06:08.280
Uh, tiger con chat says with Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony doing their own thing. They don't

06:08.280 --> 06:12.200
need E3 anymore. Well, it's interesting. And you know, Bobby went in the current iteration

06:12.200 --> 06:16.160
of E3 is garbage anyway. Yeah. Bobby went in depth on this, on his show, a little bit

06:16.160 --> 06:21.600
talking about kind of like the industry basically has no trade show right now because you know,

06:21.600 --> 06:26.040
the consumers, uh, demanded to be led into the trade show. Um, and I thought he made

06:26.040 --> 06:31.240
some very good points and kind of ended up on an aha moment towards the end of the show.

06:31.240 --> 06:38.720
Like when, when did E3 really start to shit the bed? I don't know how else to put it.

06:38.720 --> 06:43.440
And I honestly, a lot of it is on, and I, I really put most of the blame at the feet

06:43.440 --> 06:47.960
of the ESA. And I, again, I've been saying this for a long time. This one's a little

06:47.960 --> 06:54.080
more of a hot take, take it or leave it. The ESA is an archaic organization that is

06:54.080 --> 06:58.400
not doing no good for this industry right now. And I don't know why the ESA is still

06:58.400 --> 07:03.080
in business, quite frankly. Uh, when Sony backed out of E3, that should have been the

07:03.080 --> 07:07.520
beginning of the end for the ESA. I kind of think it was, I think they're just dying a

07:07.520 --> 07:14.560
much slower death. Um, and I think is, is that in any industry innovation is, is difficult.

07:14.560 --> 07:20.840
Anything that changes what people are used to is, well, I mean, people are slow to slow

07:20.840 --> 07:27.420
to change and, and I don't disagree. However, this is the fucking tech industry and I would

07:27.420 --> 07:33.480
expect the ESA to be innovating and you, you're, you're, you're right in that they don't. And

07:33.480 --> 07:37.360
that's why they're, they're a failure. And that's why they got hacked all those times

07:37.360 --> 07:41.420
that they did, because they can't even live up to the security that they're preaching

07:41.420 --> 07:46.980
other people to follow. Like the ESA is a joke. Like, and so I, for one will not miss

07:46.980 --> 07:52.860
E3, rest in piss. Bye. And I think, you know, we got into a lot of it a couple of weeks

07:52.860 --> 08:00.620
ago about how a lot of what E3 kind of stood for 20 years ago, doesn't hold up anymore.

08:00.620 --> 08:05.780
This industry had a lot of growing up to do, still has some growing up to do, but it's

08:05.780 --> 08:09.460
grown up a little bit. You know, I think we can look that there has been progress made

08:09.460 --> 08:14.480
in the last 20 years. And I don't think the show of 20 years ago is going to hold up anymore.

08:14.480 --> 08:21.100
So I think the E3 that all of you remember being televised on G4, which was that point

08:21.100 --> 08:26.660
that we kind of hit on at the end of Bobby show where, uh, when they started televising

08:26.660 --> 08:35.340
E3 on G4, it turned up that FOMO dial to 11. What other trade show was televised on TV

08:35.340 --> 08:38.220
24 seven.

08:38.940 --> 08:40.580
Which it didn't need to be.

08:40.580 --> 08:43.780
No, it didn't. And the ESA shouldn't have allowed it.

08:43.780 --> 08:50.140
That was the failure. So they, well, the whole thing is that I think if we open this up to

08:50.140 --> 08:57.240
some of the public, right, then this is going to put more money in our pockets with, with

08:57.240 --> 09:04.180
losing sight of what the purpose of the show is for. Now, I mean, when, when I was going,

09:04.180 --> 09:11.060
it was under the DDR freak umbrella, but I also took the opportunities to, to try to

09:11.060 --> 09:15.820
network, you know, I mean, that's when I went to a GDC, that's what I was doing was networking

09:15.820 --> 09:18.460
with people.

09:18.460 --> 09:22.180
I I'm, I'm going to say something I'm probably going to regret saying, but I'm going to say

09:22.180 --> 09:27.300
it anyway. You know me, um, I well, and I've also grown up and my perspectives have changed

09:27.300 --> 09:31.300
over the last few years and I reserve the right to change my opinions because sometimes

09:31.300 --> 09:35.100
I learn new things that changed my opinions. And so what I'm going to say in the context

09:35.100 --> 09:41.060
of that is, number one, I don't think E3 should ever come back. We should have a trade show.

09:41.060 --> 09:48.060
Yes, but I don't think the ESA, it shouldn't be the ESA's thing because the ESA is incompetent.

09:48.060 --> 09:53.220
But although the name is very clever, just saying E3, you know, I think they should keep

09:53.220 --> 09:55.380
the name and have someone else own it.

09:55.380 --> 10:02.180
If E3 were to come back, I think it should go back to the airport years when it was very

10:02.180 --> 10:07.540
selective on who got in and very selective on what they were showing and how that all

10:07.540 --> 10:14.260
went down. Obviously that needs to be, um, tailored a little more. Um, and, uh, but that's,

10:14.260 --> 10:20.300
that's what the show, whatever succeeds E3 is probably going to look like, and I'm saying

10:20.300 --> 10:27.620
this because people need to get used to this. If they really truly want a trade show, it's

10:27.620 --> 10:31.820
going to look like those years that E3 was at the Long Beach airport. Was that where

10:31.820 --> 10:35.700
it was? I think it was. And that the hotels and all of that. And that was the year that

10:35.700 --> 10:40.140
only what, like two to 3000 people got in. I know semantics, semantics. I know you're

10:40.140 --> 10:45.160
going to say they're under contract to the LA conventions. The ESA shouldn't even doing

10:45.160 --> 10:48.700
it in the first place. Those contracts won't matter. I'm not even saying it needs to be

10:48.700 --> 10:54.740
in LA. Um, I think you either go to a different name in the ESA, is it running it then that

10:54.740 --> 11:01.580
contract doesn't apply. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so I, it'll be interesting to see what comes

11:01.580 --> 11:08.480
of the whole thing. Um, Bobby is in chat saying my favorite E3 was E3 2008, which was limited

11:08.480 --> 11:13.560
attendance like the airport years, but still at LA convention center. E3 2007 was the one

11:13.560 --> 11:17.780
in Santa Monica, but they ran a small E3 at the LA convention center and that was better

11:17.780 --> 11:22.520
than the, uh, than the spread out stuff in the airport hangar. That sounds a lot like

11:22.520 --> 11:26.460
a logistic thing where like just being all spread out all over Long Beach was probably

11:26.460 --> 11:29.900
a pain in the butt. Having it all at the LA convention center was probably just a lot

11:29.900 --> 11:34.020
more convenient. And I, I that's, that's a logistics thing. And you know, that's up to

11:34.020 --> 11:40.740
whatever E3 successor, if there is one ends up being. So, um, we'll see. Now, the fall

11:40.740 --> 11:44.760
was really just getting rid of Kenshi Hall. I'm kidding. Um, I didn't even really get

11:44.760 --> 11:52.380
into the specifics of the story. Um, the news broke from a tweet from Razor PR lead

11:52.380 --> 11:57.980
Will Powers, um, who said that they had sent out an email announcing the cancellation of

11:57.980 --> 12:03.980
a digital E3 event. Well, if you're going to have an E3 where you actually want to keep

12:03.980 --> 12:09.840
secrets that don't get out to the internet, now you know how, who not to invite. No, he,

12:09.840 --> 12:15.300
he didn't do anything wrong. Um, but I was just thinking about how there are other trade

12:15.300 --> 12:20.260
shows. Like the movie industry has a trade show where they show new movies to cinema

12:20.260 --> 12:26.220
or new trailers anyway, to a cinema chain owners and people that own movie theaters.

12:26.220 --> 12:31.020
And those trailers don't leak out because there's still a lot of NDAs and non-disclosure

12:31.020 --> 12:35.160
agreements that go in line with those. I'll be interested to see what sort of non-disclosures

12:35.160 --> 12:40.980
agreements, whatever EA successor gets into. There were always NDAs at E3, by the way,

12:40.980 --> 12:44.260
just not the stuff that was out there on the show floor, but everything you were seeing

12:44.260 --> 12:48.560
upstairs in the conference room, I would say 90% of that was under non-disclosure agreements

12:48.560 --> 12:52.520
because they were showing things that weren't going to be announced for a little while.

12:52.520 --> 12:58.580
So ends up in some of the rooms that would say no, no video, no photography. And then

12:58.580 --> 13:04.540
there would be some that would be like, you know, they would have specific material or

13:04.540 --> 13:13.640
copies of the demo to give out that didn't have like anything of worth on it. Like more

13:13.640 --> 13:18.300
like a press kit on a CD in the later times.

13:18.300 --> 13:22.340
By the way, I'm going back to the story and I'm looking at the guy's Twitter and it says

13:22.340 --> 13:26.620
in his bio, he's a reality TV winner. Wasn't this the guy that won the tester? I'm almost

13:26.620 --> 13:28.300
positive it was.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.300
What's his name?

13:29.300 --> 13:33.760
Will Powers. Didn't he win like the first or second season of the tester?

13:33.980 --> 13:38.880
I was like a raptor, but I don't know that guy didn't win. He was on it. Sure. He did

13:38.880 --> 13:45.200
not win. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's I'm I just, am I the only one that sees the humor

13:45.200 --> 13:46.200
in that?

13:46.200 --> 13:54.040
I never watched. I never watched the use our Google food. So this is the tester winner.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.200
That was the only one. I think there's only one. No, there's a few seasons because the

13:57.200 --> 14:02.360
gay guy won one of the seasons. Oh, really? And then

14:02.360 --> 14:03.360
I wonder why it fails.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.560
Cyrus on season one.

14:06.560 --> 14:11.480
Yeah. Bobby's saying Wiki doesn't even give their real names. I'm I'm telling you, it's

14:11.480 --> 14:13.760
the guy that won the tester.

14:13.760 --> 14:18.840
Season two was gamer. G A Y M E R. Okay. Cesar three was

14:18.840 --> 14:20.520
Mike. Mike Deff's agrees with me.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.020
Achilles might.

14:22.020 --> 14:28.120
Mike Deff agrees with me. Will Powers won season one. Yes. Okay. And Bobby says, yes,

14:28.120 --> 14:33.960
Cyrus was Will Powers. Okay, thank you. All right. Now, I'm glad I'm just I'm just surprised

14:33.960 --> 14:37.840
that's not in the bio here on the news article.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.400
Yep, that's it.

14:40.400 --> 14:45.880
Okay. Oh, Mike Deff brought the receipts from a PlayStation blog. That's funny.

14:45.880 --> 14:46.880
Yeah, I see that.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.880
It was also an Engadget article.

14:48.880 --> 14:54.440
Well, good for him. He's living out his dream being in the industry and and providing breaking

14:54.440 --> 14:57.720
breaking news. Good for him. I'm not I'm not being shady at all.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.200
I'll never invite him back.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.200
Well, it was just one of those things where I was like, wait a minute. Why I can't shake

15:03.200 --> 15:11.080
this feeling. All right. Anyway, um, the ESA did confirm in an official statement that

15:11.080 --> 15:19.120
E3 2022 is canceled. However, they say in the follow up, E3 will return in 2023 with

15:19.120 --> 15:24.720
a reinvigorated showcase.

15:24.720 --> 15:29.920
So that's we're saying so as much as I'm sitting here celebrating the death of E3 because

15:29.920 --> 15:35.840
I think that's a line. I don't think it is coming back in 2023. We'll see. Yeah, no,

15:35.840 --> 15:36.840
I you know,

15:36.840 --> 15:41.180
it means they haven't made a decision to cancel it for good. That's all. Yeah.

15:41.180 --> 15:48.920
So yeah, here's the entire statement from the ESA. E3 will return in 2023 with a reinvigorated

15:48.920 --> 15:54.180
showcase that celebrates new and exciting video games and industry innovations. We previously

15:54.180 --> 15:59.480
announced that E3 would not be held in person in 2022 due to the ongoing health risks that

15:59.480 --> 16:00.480
surrounding COVID-19.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.180
Oh, that's true.

16:03.180 --> 16:10.680
Well, I'm it's a cop out. It's escaped out. Like I'm not I'm not saying it's not true.

16:10.680 --> 16:15.600
But I'm saying compared to literally the rest of the world and how everything is functioning

16:15.600 --> 16:20.140
at other trade shows. And so in fact that like people are not canceling anything because

16:20.140 --> 16:26.740
COVID anymore. And I just got back from Las Vegas, where I was maybe in the 3% of people

16:26.740 --> 16:37.060
that were wearing masks in casinos, like COVID-19 is a convenient excuse for the ESA. And I

16:37.060 --> 16:43.180
I know that's not the the the PC thing to say. But it's absolutely correct. And I think

16:43.180 --> 16:49.740
COVID-19 was the convenient excuse for the ESA last year to to be quite honest,

16:49.980 --> 16:52.940
should be a valid excuse. People aren't really treating it as one.

16:53.020 --> 16:53.740
Correct.

16:54.420 --> 16:58.280
It is but they could take precautions and stuff, especially that would be your perfect time to

16:58.280 --> 17:03.980
lower the attendance is to, you know, okay, we'll have people in person, but we're only going to do

17:03.980 --> 17:08.940
like a quarter of the attendees due to COVID or something, but they didn't even do that. They

17:08.940 --> 17:10.540
just said, oh, we're not doing it.

17:10.580 --> 17:15.540
Fucking brilliant. Loki. Honestly, the best thing the ESA probably could have done was to have it

17:15.540 --> 17:21.100
anyway, vaccine masks, and you know what, we're not going to have the consumers this year, we're

17:21.100 --> 17:25.100
not going to we're going to cut all these people out because of COVID.

17:27.060 --> 17:29.580
Your perfect scapegoat right there, you know, you could just

17:29.900 --> 17:33.220
that would have been to what it was that would have been the better scapegoat.

17:35.060 --> 17:41.420
But that's not why so you know that that's why they're, you know, doing what they're doing.

17:42.180 --> 17:47.260
Anyway, continuing with the statement. Today, we announced there will also be no digital E3

17:47.260 --> 17:50.540
showcase in 2022. See, COVID doesn't stop that.

17:50.940 --> 17:55.140
Well, that's because of digital COVID. Haven't you heard? It's the new variant that goes over the

17:55.140 --> 17:55.540
internet.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.980
Ah, yes, the computer will get COVID.

17:56.980 --> 17:59.420
Yes, we can't expose our people.

17:59.420 --> 18:03.300
Yes, the computer virus that exposes personal information. Yes.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.260
And then the variant Corvid where you you know, poop crows.

18:07.060 --> 18:08.980
The metaverse COVID.

18:11.140 --> 18:11.780
MetaVid.

18:13.140 --> 18:19.620
Instead, we will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and

18:19.620 --> 18:21.620
digital E3 experience next summer.

18:22.020 --> 18:26.820
Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the

18:26.820 --> 18:31.620
community, media and industry back together in an all new format and interactive experience.

18:32.180 --> 18:34.460
Bullshit, but I'm going to tell you why it's bullshit.

18:34.860 --> 18:40.420
If the ESA wants me to believe that because right now I don't and I've given you a damn good list of

18:40.420 --> 18:41.580
reasons why I don't.

18:42.380 --> 18:46.940
They would have already said, who's on board with that 2023 vision?

18:47.260 --> 18:50.980
Who have you gotten to agree to this 2023 show?

18:51.060 --> 18:52.740
Who are your partners in this?

18:52.900 --> 18:54.020
You don't got any.

18:55.820 --> 18:58.300
You're trying to sell snake oil right now, ESA.

18:59.140 --> 19:01.020
You're selling a vision.

19:01.020 --> 19:01.940
Why don't you go to Kickstarter?

19:01.940 --> 19:02.540
And the Phantom.

19:03.020 --> 19:03.660
And the Phantom.

19:04.380 --> 19:05.860
Wasn't the Phantom there one time?

19:05.860 --> 19:07.420
I swear to God, I played the Phantom.

19:07.420 --> 19:08.420
It was, yeah.

19:09.420 --> 19:11.420
I think we saw the Phantom, yeah.

19:12.460 --> 19:13.700
It was real, sort of.

19:14.460 --> 19:14.820
All right.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.060
For like a minute.

19:16.060 --> 19:18.780
What was in the box?

19:18.820 --> 19:23.780
We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023.

19:23.780 --> 19:27.540
That part they have to say because of the contract with the convention center.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.820
Look for more news and announcements soon.

19:29.860 --> 19:32.220
So that's, that's the one thing you can count on.

19:33.100 --> 19:36.660
The ESA, if they don't end up just throwing it in the trash, they're going to have this

19:36.660 --> 19:39.340
convention at the LA convention center because they have to.

19:40.620 --> 19:43.540
So, I mean, that doesn't mean it won't be like one room.

19:43.860 --> 19:46.260
Not it'll, it might be the size of drag con.

19:46.260 --> 19:51.140
It might just be one little hall, but it might, it'll still happen at the LA convention center.

19:52.300 --> 19:56.220
There's a line from MST3K that's popping through my head right now.

19:56.220 --> 19:57.500
Whoopty shit.

19:58.260 --> 20:02.860
I just think what it is, is it, it, I think you have a lot of these companies, I would

20:02.860 --> 20:08.860
imagine, they're looking to cut costs, throwing a big press event with booths and stuff like

20:08.860 --> 20:15.060
that, doesn't really do much more than showcasing their footage and stuff in their own

20:15.060 --> 20:17.340
controlled environment where they have all the attention.

20:17.620 --> 20:22.620
Like, I just say, it's like, I can put on a presentation for a few thousand dollars, or I

20:22.620 --> 20:25.340
could rent out a booth space for a few million dollars.

20:26.340 --> 20:27.220
What would I rather do?

20:27.220 --> 20:31.940
And then this way, you also don't have to like, push your dev teams to put out demos and

20:31.940 --> 20:34.580
stuff like that, to build a demo for E3.

20:34.940 --> 20:38.620
Like, it just makes more sense not to do it anymore.

20:40.180 --> 20:44.660
Yeah, um, I mean, there's a lot to be said, though, about some of the elements of the

20:44.660 --> 20:49.860
trade show, like the networking and, you know, connecting and sharing ideas and so forth.

20:49.860 --> 20:56.340
But yeah, the industry has kind of gotten to this interesting place where they're, they're

20:56.340 --> 20:58.980
putting so much of it just out on the internet at once.

20:58.980 --> 21:04.500
It's like, there's no secrets in this industry anymore when it comes to working with other

21:04.500 --> 21:04.940
people.

21:04.940 --> 21:06.100
I don't know, it's weird.

21:08.180 --> 21:13.260
Anyway, one thing that a lot of people are turning to is Summer Game Fest.

21:13.260 --> 21:17.100
And so a lot of people are already declaring Summer Game Fest, the new E3.

21:17.100 --> 21:21.500
It's way too early to be doing that, because Summer Game Fest is not a trade show.

21:21.980 --> 21:27.420
Summer Game Fest is a summer version of the game awards that happened in December.

21:27.580 --> 21:29.500
That is what Summer Game Fest is thus far.

21:30.020 --> 21:33.060
Not, not word for word, not page for page.

21:33.580 --> 21:35.620
But it's a very, they come from the same playbook.

21:37.420 --> 21:42.500
So Jeff Keeley did conveniently timing share some more information about Summer Game Fest.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.460
He said, yes, it's taking place this year.

21:44.460 --> 21:46.100
Yes, it's going to occur in June.

21:46.260 --> 21:49.380
Yes, there's going to be a live kickoff show at the start of the event.

21:50.060 --> 21:54.820
And the presentation will have new announcements and first looks at various gaming properties.

21:55.620 --> 22:00.300
The official website, of course, will have all the details in the coming weeks.

22:01.300 --> 22:06.020
Jeff Keeley also had a very interesting timed tweet with everything that was going on with

22:06.020 --> 22:06.500
E3.

22:06.500 --> 22:09.220
I got to pull it up now because of course, I don't have it in front of me.

22:09.380 --> 22:12.580
But he said something very tongue in cheek, and he kind of had to go back and clarify

22:12.580 --> 22:18.420
it that like, I'm not trying to shade E3, but like the tweet read is like, kind of shady.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.860
I wonder if he still has it up or if he ended up deleting it.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.500
Of course, I'm sure the chat is already on it.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.220
But I'm trying to bring it up for myself here.

22:28.100 --> 22:28.900
Let's see.

22:30.500 --> 22:30.900
Huh.

22:30.900 --> 22:31.460
My bad.

22:31.460 --> 22:32.820
I'll bring it up for myself here.

22:33.940 --> 22:34.820
Let's see.

22:36.500 --> 22:37.700
March 31st.

22:37.700 --> 22:38.660
It was a day.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.420
Oh, he just tweeted a winky face.

22:42.580 --> 22:47.620
That's a lot of people thought that was a winky face emote was you shady bitch pretty

22:47.620 --> 22:48.100
much.

22:50.740 --> 22:52.900
I guess you can read a lot into a winky face emote.

22:52.900 --> 22:53.380
I don't know.

22:54.260 --> 22:55.540
But anyway, Summer Game Fest.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.340
It's coming back.

22:56.980 --> 22:57.620
We'll see.

22:57.860 --> 23:00.260
We'll see how it goes and what they all have.

23:00.260 --> 23:01.300
But it's not a trade show.

23:01.940 --> 23:06.820
There might be a keynote that happens in person or something like that, but it's not going

23:06.820 --> 23:09.060
to be exactly the same thing as E3.

23:10.660 --> 23:17.060
It looks like the June gaming event season, which I don't even know if we call it E3 anymore.

23:17.060 --> 23:19.060
I don't think we shouldn't be calling it E3 anymore.

23:19.060 --> 23:26.500
The June media season in gaming will probably be a Nintendo Direct.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.140
That's also another interesting question to ask.

23:29.220 --> 23:32.900
Nintendo is off the hook to do an E3 direct.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.660
Will they still do one in June?

23:35.620 --> 23:37.140
I don't see why they wouldn't.

23:38.020 --> 23:45.940
But if Nintendo decided to do a summer direct in July, y'all can't say shit because there's

23:45.940 --> 23:47.300
no E3 to time it with.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.420
So I wonder if that might get delayed.

23:50.420 --> 23:50.900
We'll see.

23:52.980 --> 23:58.260
I just wonder if we're still going to see game companies kind of coalesce around doing

23:58.260 --> 24:01.620
announcements in June or if it's just going to be all over the place.

24:02.980 --> 24:07.780
Tiger Claw on chat says they'll probably do a direct but not call it E3 or something.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.540
Did they call it E3 last year?

24:10.820 --> 24:11.940
I don't remember if they did.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.540
Pele Jarumeo says they did not.

24:17.540 --> 24:17.940
Thank you.

24:18.740 --> 24:25.140
Pele Jarumeo says just like tech killed newspapers, E3 is a victim of changing media habits and

24:25.140 --> 24:25.780
tech.

24:25.780 --> 24:28.740
That's why the fan centric cons will still flourish.

24:28.740 --> 24:30.020
Oh, absolutely.

24:30.020 --> 24:32.660
This has nothing to do with fan cons.

24:32.660 --> 24:36.820
And ironically, the consumer expos, this has nothing to do with them.

24:37.700 --> 24:44.660
And this that you're right, they will continue to flourish as people are feeling the pain

24:44.660 --> 24:46.500
of the last two years.

24:46.500 --> 24:51.700
And even if it's probably not the best idea to be going out and doing these things, people

24:51.700 --> 24:53.300
are going to go out and do these things.

24:53.300 --> 24:57.940
We can at least hope conventions will be smart and at least have precautions because

24:57.940 --> 25:02.020
precautions, you know, and Bobby said this earlier, there is no convention that has been

25:02.020 --> 25:04.340
declared a super spreader or no gaming convention.

25:04.340 --> 25:09.060
I know of that's been declared a super spreader event yet because they're all mandating

25:09.060 --> 25:10.100
precautions.

25:10.100 --> 25:16.260
Everyone I've been to is mask and VAX or negative test in 48 hours or whatever it is,

25:16.260 --> 25:17.460
whatever it was for Dragon Con.

25:18.020 --> 25:22.820
And following those precautions go an awful long way in stopping super spreader types

25:22.820 --> 25:23.300
of things.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.780
So interesting.

25:25.780 --> 25:28.500
Bobby Blackwell says, I just checked a super spreader database.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.300
Not a single convention was on the list as a super spreader event.

25:31.300 --> 25:32.980
Lots of weddings and nursing homes, though.

25:34.340 --> 25:38.900
I thought early on in the pandemic, there was ironically a science convention that was

25:38.900 --> 25:40.500
one of the first super spreader events.

25:41.300 --> 25:44.100
So and that obviously nobody knew anything then.

25:44.100 --> 25:48.660
So I'm not saying it's a fault of that convention, but I worry about that database you're looking

25:48.660 --> 25:52.500
at because if it doesn't list that one, a biotech or something like that was one of

25:52.500 --> 25:56.020
the early, early, early conventions in the science industry that had it.

25:56.020 --> 26:01.220
So Mike Deff says, I went to a convention yesterday and most people were masked, even

26:01.220 --> 26:02.260
if it was an outside event.

26:02.900 --> 26:06.900
SSU100Matt says the Sturgis Bike Festival was a super spreader event.

26:06.900 --> 26:13.220
Well, the people there simply did not believe in COVID.

26:14.580 --> 26:16.820
And that wasn't a convention to be that also.

26:16.820 --> 26:18.100
That was a very different.

26:18.100 --> 26:20.820
That was a festival semantics, I know.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.860
But it it would fall in a different category.

26:24.500 --> 26:28.820
So isn't that the one that Smash Mouth played and gotten a lot of shit for?

26:28.820 --> 26:29.940
I think it was.

26:29.940 --> 26:35.300
Anyway, I think I think I think it was because I remember the parodies that were like, hey,

26:35.300 --> 26:36.740
now you've got COVID.

26:36.740 --> 26:37.940
Get your cough on.

26:37.940 --> 26:38.660
Hey, now.

26:38.660 --> 26:38.900
All right.

26:38.900 --> 26:42.660
Anyway, we shouldn't joke about it, but I do.

26:42.660 --> 26:47.460
I have to tell jokes when people have to have that gallows humor when you when people are

26:47.460 --> 26:49.300
willfully ignorant about it.

26:49.300 --> 26:50.820
I have to joke about that.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.460
So please understand the difference.

26:54.100 --> 26:54.500
All right.

26:55.700 --> 26:59.860
Anyhow, so E3 canceled back next year.

27:00.980 --> 27:04.500
Summer Game Fest still happening, although we don't know the specifics of what that looked

27:04.500 --> 27:04.900
like.

27:04.900 --> 27:09.700
But it will be interesting to see if Jeff Keighley tries to corral the horses because

27:09.700 --> 27:10.420
he does.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.580
He does have a good relationship with Nintendo.

27:12.580 --> 27:14.740
He does have a good relationship with a lot of partners.

27:14.740 --> 27:19.300
It will be interesting to see if he does corral the horses to get everybody to still

27:19.300 --> 27:21.620
make their announcements around that same time.

27:21.620 --> 27:26.180
I just think what Jeff Keighley needs to do don't have Summer Game Fest as a three month

27:26.180 --> 27:26.500
event.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.340
That was silly.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.420
That lowers the impact of it.

27:30.420 --> 27:33.620
You need to corral that to two weeks tops.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.060
I mean, if people want to do announcements outside of that, fine.

27:37.060 --> 27:38.500
But that's not Summer Game Fest.

27:39.140 --> 27:43.940
So just something I think Jeff needs to work on in that whole regard is Summer Game Fest

27:43.940 --> 27:45.060
is not a three month event.

27:45.060 --> 27:45.700
Give me a break.

27:46.260 --> 27:48.820
That's just summer in the games industry.

27:49.940 --> 27:51.700
So yeah, Dr.

27:51.700 --> 27:55.780
Sia says, I mean, if he can do it for the game awards and he has no competition this

27:55.780 --> 27:57.620
year, this is the year to do it.

27:58.260 --> 28:04.980
This is the if Jeff wants to attack the ESA's weak point for massive damage and considering

28:04.980 --> 28:10.660
he backed out of E3 before it was officially gone, he may have a bone to pick with them

28:10.660 --> 28:11.300
allegedly.

28:11.300 --> 28:16.260
I don't know anything, but there are interesting signs that line up that show that Jeff Keighley

28:16.260 --> 28:20.580
may have a little bit of personal interest in attacking the weak point of E3 for massive

28:20.580 --> 28:21.300
damage here.

28:21.300 --> 28:28.980
I don't know, but I know why we're here to announce Keighley 3 coming soon this summer.

28:28.980 --> 28:33.060
I don't know about y'all, but spite is a big motivator for me.

28:33.860 --> 28:39.140
And if I'm Jeff Keighley and I may or may not allegedly have some spite in my back pocket,

28:39.140 --> 28:40.420
let that do the motivating.

28:41.780 --> 28:44.820
Godspeed, Jeff Keighley, our Canadian friend.

28:44.820 --> 28:45.320
All right.

28:46.260 --> 28:51.380
By the way, Rob, I think I found my E3 2006 photos.

28:53.380 --> 28:54.340
I have one of those two.

28:54.340 --> 28:57.940
There's one of you and I sitting on the ground in the media room somewhere that keeps popping

28:57.940 --> 28:58.900
up and that one.

28:58.900 --> 29:01.460
But these are hold on.

29:02.580 --> 29:04.020
They need to be super rotated.

29:04.020 --> 29:05.300
I don't know how they got this way.

29:06.340 --> 29:07.060
Okay, never mind.

29:07.060 --> 29:09.460
That's the Winchester Mystery House, but I have a couple.

29:10.420 --> 29:13.700
So because it was in May that year.

29:15.860 --> 29:18.100
So I'll have to see if I can find them.

29:18.100 --> 29:21.540
They got to be spread out amongst these, but I did find the one of you and me.

29:21.540 --> 29:24.820
Vognetwork.com slash discord to so young.

29:25.460 --> 29:26.500
I know what happened.

29:27.060 --> 29:27.560
All right.

29:28.900 --> 29:29.940
Enough about E3.

29:29.940 --> 29:33.380
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things that we have been playing

29:33.380 --> 29:34.020
this week.

29:34.020 --> 29:35.780
So Dark Sakura, I'll start with you.

29:35.780 --> 29:36.660
How was your gaming week?

29:37.620 --> 29:39.780
Um, it's been pretty eventful.

29:40.340 --> 29:47.300
I'm still playing through Seiken Densetsu 3 or as it was called Trials of Mana.

29:48.820 --> 29:55.140
I'm also, of course, still doing Dead by Daylight, which I'm having a lot of fun with.

29:55.140 --> 29:56.260
I found a picture of Evan.

29:56.900 --> 29:57.860
I'm sorry.

29:57.860 --> 30:04.900
Anyway, I'm also still playing my silly little wordscapes game and I've been enjoying

30:04.900 --> 30:07.700
watching other people play Elden Ring, so I don't have to.

30:09.700 --> 30:14.900
We also have the Indianapolis 500 pinball now, and there's been a little bit of play

30:14.900 --> 30:16.020
that going on in my house.

30:16.020 --> 30:16.580
Oh, that's fun.

30:17.860 --> 30:19.700
Yeah, not too bad.

30:21.460 --> 30:21.780
All right.

30:21.780 --> 30:22.740
That's about it.

30:22.740 --> 30:23.540
Loki, we'll go to you.

30:23.540 --> 30:24.340
How was your gaming week?

30:25.220 --> 30:34.820
Uh, well, I played Minecraft still, and I also did finally boot up my DR machine to

30:35.700 --> 30:39.940
set it up for the kids to play, and then they were doing something else, so I decided to

30:39.940 --> 30:42.900
play it a little bit, so I need to get back into that.

30:42.900 --> 30:43.860
At least it still works.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.980
Yeah, and that's it?

30:49.700 --> 30:50.260
That's it.

30:50.260 --> 30:50.660
Yeah.

30:50.660 --> 30:53.300
You know Minecraft and usually something else.

30:53.300 --> 30:53.700
All right.

30:53.700 --> 30:54.340
I found them.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.340
E3 2005.

30:57.540 --> 30:57.780
Get it.

30:57.780 --> 30:59.140
Put them in our Discord server or something.

30:59.140 --> 31:03.060
I bet folks would like to see with the boomerang controller for the PS3.

31:03.620 --> 31:04.180
Oh, God.

31:05.140 --> 31:06.340
That's a throwback.

31:06.340 --> 31:06.980
All right.

31:06.980 --> 31:08.180
Get ready, Discord.

31:09.700 --> 31:12.180
Maybe do like one or two a day this week.

31:12.180 --> 31:14.500
Don't throw 30 pictures in there at once.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.300
I'll forget.

31:15.300 --> 31:15.620
All right.

31:16.820 --> 31:17.700
I'll do a group of them.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.220
Let's see.

31:19.220 --> 31:20.020
My gaming week.

31:20.020 --> 31:23.620
So I ended up not playing a lot this week because I've been in Vegas for the past few

31:23.620 --> 31:27.220
days, so we went to Las Vegas on Wednesday and just got back yesterday.

31:27.220 --> 31:31.060
We flew back Saturday because it was cheaper flights, but while we were in Vegas, we went

31:31.060 --> 31:37.460
to the Pinball Museum Hall of Fame, and it's in a new place now than the last time I went.

31:37.460 --> 31:40.980
It used to be in that strip mall that was a little ways away from the strip.

31:40.980 --> 31:43.300
Now it is literally at the start of the strip.

31:43.300 --> 31:43.940
They moved it.

31:43.940 --> 31:47.940
It's right where the famous sign that says, Welcome to Vegas is at the very start of the

31:47.940 --> 31:48.440
strip.

31:49.060 --> 31:50.420
Kind of it's honest.

31:50.420 --> 31:51.700
Okay, let me put it in perspective.

31:52.340 --> 31:57.140
In Pikmin, when I hit my little radar thing at the Pinball Hall of Fame, I got airport

31:57.140 --> 31:59.620
Pikmin because it's literally right there.

32:00.420 --> 32:03.060
Could be near the Liberace Museum, remember?

32:04.580 --> 32:06.100
Where was the Liberace Museum?

32:06.100 --> 32:06.740
That was-

32:06.740 --> 32:07.620
I don't remember.

32:07.620 --> 32:10.820
I just remember that we passed the Liberace Museum when Tiara took me.

32:13.300 --> 32:20.100
I know that you can't miss this place because they've painted the word pinball in gigantic

32:20.100 --> 32:23.780
letters, and I think they did it because the airport is right there.

32:23.780 --> 32:28.820
You can see it as you're actually landing at the airport, which is pretty funny, and

32:28.820 --> 32:31.460
that's a very funny way to advertise.

32:31.460 --> 32:35.300
They also have their own fancy new neon sign that looks like the Vegas sign.

32:35.300 --> 32:39.700
So they're making money or something or got a good grant or something because they've

32:39.700 --> 32:40.980
really upped the place.

32:40.980 --> 32:44.420
It's a much bigger space and they have more stuff in there.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.980
They have a lot of broken stuff, but they had that before.

32:46.980 --> 32:50.260
I'm not really holding that against them because they have a lot of great working stuff.

32:51.060 --> 32:53.140
So I saw a crap ton of pinball tables.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.860
I more watched Alan play.

32:55.860 --> 32:57.140
I didn't play a lot myself.

32:57.140 --> 33:00.020
I played the Tron arcade machine they had there because I had to.

33:00.900 --> 33:06.900
I played a Nightmare on Elm Street pinball table, which I forgot existed, and I enjoyed

33:06.900 --> 33:07.140
it.

33:07.140 --> 33:08.740
So I was like, this is fun.

33:08.740 --> 33:11.700
Was that wasn't it like a Gottlieb one?

33:11.700 --> 33:12.900
I think it is a Gottlieb table.

33:12.900 --> 33:15.300
Yeah, I have a picture of it somewhere because I put it on Instagram.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.700
The Gottlieb ones are hit and miss.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.060
It was fun, but it's really easy.

33:21.060 --> 33:24.900
I don't know if it was tuned that way, but basically I won a free game and Alan won a

33:24.900 --> 33:25.460
free game.

33:25.460 --> 33:26.420
So it was very easy.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.780
Um, and then I watched.

33:29.780 --> 33:32.020
This is a funny thing, and you'll get a kick out of this dark soccer.

33:32.020 --> 33:36.180
I watched Alan drop like $4 into Elvira scared stiff.

33:36.820 --> 33:39.220
And I was like, why don't you just go to dark soccer's house?

33:39.220 --> 33:40.420
Or well, I know you don't have it anymore.

33:40.420 --> 33:40.980
We gave it back.

33:40.980 --> 33:43.060
I know, but I was like, why don't you just go over there and play it?

33:43.060 --> 33:46.740
But he was like, I'm here and it's right in front of me and damn it, I'm going to play

33:46.740 --> 33:46.900
it.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.380
I'm like, all right, I'm not going to tell you what to do.

33:49.380 --> 33:50.340
Like I can play Tron.

33:50.340 --> 33:51.300
I'm not faulting that.

33:51.300 --> 33:51.700
Yeah.

33:51.700 --> 33:54.660
So, um, and I watched him play some other stuff too.

33:55.220 --> 33:57.620
I watched him play that, uh, circus volitaire.

33:57.620 --> 33:58.660
It's a fun machine.

33:58.660 --> 33:59.060
Voltaire.

33:59.060 --> 33:59.700
That's it.

33:59.700 --> 34:00.580
Uh, that's a fun machine.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.700
I'm trying to remember what else I played.

34:01.700 --> 34:02.580
Oh, Arabian nights.

34:02.580 --> 34:03.220
I love that table.

34:03.220 --> 34:04.020
I have to play that.

34:04.020 --> 34:05.940
That was also a Papa Duke table.

34:05.940 --> 34:08.900
The guy who did a theater and a world cup.

34:10.420 --> 34:10.920
Got it.

34:11.460 --> 34:15.940
Um, Bobby Blackwell says the Liberace museum was North and East of the airport.

34:15.940 --> 34:19.140
The pinball hall of fame is on the Western edge of the airport.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.380
It's right next door to the Harley Davidson thing.

34:21.940 --> 34:23.060
I do know that too.

34:23.060 --> 34:23.460
I don't know.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.460
I don't know if that rings a bell at all.

34:25.460 --> 34:26.500
I don't know what it was before.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.300
Good Kingdom Hearts.

34:29.140 --> 34:30.580
Um, sorry.

34:30.580 --> 34:31.940
Oh, E3 pictures.

34:31.940 --> 34:32.740
Um, let's see.

34:32.740 --> 34:35.700
I'm trying to think of what other pinball tables I like play.

34:35.700 --> 34:38.180
They have a lot of old arcade machines too, which is cool.

34:38.180 --> 34:39.540
I just had a good time.

34:39.540 --> 34:44.020
So, and it's funny because somebody was asking me, so I missed a friend of mine that used

34:44.020 --> 34:44.900
to listen to this show.

34:44.900 --> 34:46.020
I don't know if he still does.

34:46.020 --> 34:46.260
Hi.

34:46.260 --> 34:49.780
You know who you are if you're listening, but he messaged me on Instagram and he's like,

34:49.780 --> 34:51.460
I'm going to Vegas this weekend.

34:51.860 --> 34:52.180
Great.

34:52.180 --> 34:53.060
When do you get here?

34:53.700 --> 34:58.020
He was like getting there like two hours after my flight took off on Saturday.

34:58.020 --> 34:59.940
I'm like, how convenient.

34:59.940 --> 35:02.420
So I was like, all right.

35:02.420 --> 35:04.500
Well, he said, where are the DDR machines?

35:04.500 --> 35:06.420
And I'm like, I have to be honest.

35:06.420 --> 35:10.580
I kind of stopped like scoping where DDR machines were a long time ago.

35:10.580 --> 35:14.180
I'm sure some of the casinos have them, but I don't really scope out the arcades, the

35:14.180 --> 35:14.900
casinos anymore.

35:14.900 --> 35:19.620
I said, but the pinball hall of fame has a DDR X cause I just saw that.

35:19.620 --> 35:20.820
So go there.

35:20.820 --> 35:24.660
And I just think the pinball hall of fame is a good stop for any gamer.

35:24.660 --> 35:29.540
Even if you feel kind of met on pinball, I would ask a, why are you met on pinball when

35:29.540 --> 35:32.100
you like other, I think pinball is great, but whatever.

35:32.740 --> 35:35.140
And they have a good collection of retro arcade games too.

35:35.860 --> 35:39.780
And they have like weird shit that used to be in seventies and eighties arcades.

35:39.780 --> 35:44.100
Do you remember that machine that would make wax Donald Duck figures?

35:45.300 --> 35:49.700
I think I made one with Melody when I went there with her, there was maybe dark soccer

35:49.700 --> 35:50.660
saw it when she was there.

35:51.220 --> 35:54.020
But they have one for Pluto now next to it.

35:54.020 --> 35:56.660
And I was like, wow, that's a blast from the past.

35:56.660 --> 35:57.460
So there's that.

35:58.100 --> 36:00.420
And a pod culture and chat is bringing up.

36:00.420 --> 36:03.940
Rob teased me by messaging me a pic of the doctor who pinball table.

36:03.940 --> 36:05.060
Yes, I did.

36:05.060 --> 36:05.780
I did.

36:05.780 --> 36:11.780
I wanted to play the rush pinball table, but some guy was on it like nonstop because I

36:11.780 --> 36:12.980
know it's the hot new shit.

36:12.980 --> 36:14.340
Somebody was on it nonstop.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.940
So I was like, all right, I'll just play it when I visit Bobby Black Wolf later this year

36:18.660 --> 36:20.420
for Dragon Con 2022.

36:20.420 --> 36:21.140
So we'll see.

36:21.700 --> 36:27.300
So dark to see it says I did play the Tron pinball when I was there.

36:27.300 --> 36:30.820
I did not see the Tron pinball or I would have played that too.

36:31.380 --> 36:32.500
Yeah, the pinball is good.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.660
I love what they did with the ramps in that game.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.340
But yeah, I didn't see it.

36:36.340 --> 36:37.620
You've got the deluxe that is.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.700
Yeah, it might have been out of commission.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.060
And that's why I didn't notice it.

36:41.060 --> 36:43.060
They did have a lot of pinball games are out of commission.

36:43.060 --> 36:44.420
So we'll see.

36:44.980 --> 36:48.100
Anyway, so yeah, the bulk of my gaming week was being in Vegas.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.300
I'm going to say off topic.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.860
I just have to say I saw two shows while I was in Vegas.

36:52.740 --> 36:56.260
I saw Drag Race Live and all I'm going to say about it.

36:56.260 --> 36:57.460
It wasn't that good.

36:58.260 --> 37:03.140
Like it was I felt like it was false advertising to of the eight girls on the poster.

37:03.140 --> 37:05.140
Two of them were in the show I saw that night.

37:05.700 --> 37:10.580
And then they had, I think, understudies because it was Alexis Mateo and Kahana Montrese, which

37:10.580 --> 37:11.220
both are great.

37:11.220 --> 37:12.340
Don't get me wrong.

37:12.340 --> 37:15.860
But it was a little like, oh, I thought we were going to be seeing these other girls.

37:15.860 --> 37:16.340
All right.

37:16.340 --> 37:16.740
Okay.

37:16.740 --> 37:18.980
I mean, but the whole thing is super cheesy.

37:18.980 --> 37:22.580
Anyway, I know some of you roll your eyes in the back of your head when I talk about

37:22.580 --> 37:22.980
Drag Race.

37:22.980 --> 37:23.860
That's all I'll say about it.

37:23.860 --> 37:24.660
It was silly.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.780
I think it would have I would have probably had a better time if I went to the real drag

37:27.780 --> 37:27.940
show.

37:27.940 --> 37:28.260
They have it.

37:28.260 --> 37:29.060
Send your frogs.

37:29.060 --> 37:29.780
I should have done that.

37:31.460 --> 37:35.860
But the other show I went and saw, I went and saw Dionne Warwick on Thursday night.

37:35.860 --> 37:38.420
Now y'all know I will hold her for.

37:38.420 --> 37:39.060
Yeah, exactly.

37:39.060 --> 37:40.820
I hope y'all know Dionne Warwick.

37:40.820 --> 37:41.860
That's what friends are for.

37:42.900 --> 37:43.780
And psychic.

37:43.780 --> 37:49.540
Alfie, do you know the way to San Jose, her psychic friends commercials back in the day,

37:49.540 --> 37:52.980
or the fact that she's the queen of Twitter now.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.260
She has a great Twitter account.

37:55.620 --> 37:59.700
And she was a Vegas legend for many years.

38:00.340 --> 38:05.140
And she ran in the same circles with many of those Vegas legends you hear a lot about.

38:06.580 --> 38:10.580
This place that I saw her at, I had no idea where this place was when I bought the tickets.

38:11.460 --> 38:15.300
They were expensive, but they weren't that expensive because we did get the cheap seats.

38:16.020 --> 38:18.660
But that room was maybe 250 people tops.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.180
The Lyft driver gets to the venue.

38:22.180 --> 38:25.460
There's a security guard at the gate who says, What are you here for?

38:26.340 --> 38:30.020
And I'm like, isn't this is the Dionne Warwick concert here?

38:30.020 --> 38:31.540
And they're like, Yep, go on in.

38:31.540 --> 38:33.940
It's like I had to know the password to get into this place.

38:35.140 --> 38:37.060
And then like the place was just itty bitty.

38:37.060 --> 38:41.300
It was like seeing it in a wedding hall or a wedding reception room.

38:41.300 --> 38:43.140
That's basically where I saw Dionne Warwick.

38:43.140 --> 38:47.540
I haven't been to a concert that small since I saw Alanis Morissette perform at a library

38:48.660 --> 38:49.380
in Big Sur.

38:50.100 --> 38:57.780
So that right there was a pleasure, a treat, a once in a lifetime experience because Dionne

38:57.780 --> 38:59.620
Warwick is a living legend.

38:59.620 --> 39:03.540
If you don't know her, Google her, look her up, educate yourself because she's fabulous.

39:04.340 --> 39:06.740
And the fact that I got to see her in such a small venue.

39:06.740 --> 39:13.060
I'm like, Oh, and by the way, Alan and I, by far the youngest people in that room, by

39:13.060 --> 39:14.900
far the youngest people in that room.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.180
The other people sitting at the table with us.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.700
The lady was super nice.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.700
She was like, Yeah, I just retired.

39:21.700 --> 39:24.580
I worked at the Vegas Convention Center and I just retired.

39:24.580 --> 39:26.580
And let me tell you about all these things in Vegas.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.060
She enjoyed hearing our story.

39:29.060 --> 39:30.900
She was just a spunky older.

39:30.900 --> 39:33.380
I'm not gonna say old lady, older lady.

39:33.860 --> 39:34.980
Lady in her prime.

39:35.940 --> 39:42.100
Yeah, so and yes, Misha also brings up for those that don't know, she's Whitney Houston's

39:42.100 --> 39:42.500
cousin.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.900
Yes, she's related to Whitney Houston as well.

39:44.900 --> 39:47.060
I think Dionne Warwick is a legend in her own right.

39:47.060 --> 39:50.020
But of course, we love legends related to legends, of course.

39:50.020 --> 39:55.780
So anyway, so it was the whole thing was absolutely worth it for the Dionne Warwick show 100%.

39:55.780 --> 39:58.660
And if you're going to be in Vegas when she's performing, I urge you to do it.

39:59.300 --> 40:02.020
But you might want to dress nicer than Alan and I did.

40:03.460 --> 40:06.180
Because the Vegas thing said it was casual.

40:06.180 --> 40:10.660
And I wore I wore like a nice little polo shirt and some jeans.

40:10.660 --> 40:12.100
So it was like what I might wear to work.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.620
But I get there and people are like full on in suits and ties.

40:16.340 --> 40:17.140
Boomer casual.

40:18.020 --> 40:18.820
Yeah, you have to.

40:18.820 --> 40:20.340
Yes, you have to go boomer casual.

40:22.580 --> 40:24.420
Anyway, no regrets.

40:24.420 --> 40:25.620
I had a great time at the show.

40:25.620 --> 40:28.020
Just like you're going on a Pan Am flight.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.660
Tiger class says no, I get it.

40:33.220 --> 40:36.260
Back in the day when people used to dress up to fly.

40:36.260 --> 40:39.620
Tiger class says sounds like the place was filled with old people who grew up on Dionne

40:39.620 --> 40:40.740
Warwick, that part.

40:42.020 --> 40:47.060
Or people who knew people who were old and grew up on Dionne Warwick.

40:47.060 --> 40:52.260
So they heard a lot of it in, you know, so that's that's where I come in, I think.

40:52.260 --> 40:57.620
And I just, you know, there's certain pictures of Rob and Matt, when you're gay, there's

40:57.620 --> 41:00.980
certain divas you're going to hear about Dionne Warwick's one of them.

41:00.980 --> 41:03.780
She might not be the one you hear about the most, but she's definitely one you're going

41:03.780 --> 41:04.340
to hear about.

41:04.340 --> 41:10.340
So anyway, sorry to delve into non-gaming stuff, but I had to get that off my chest

41:10.340 --> 41:13.940
because again, that was a once in a lifetime show and I was just very giddy to get to do

41:13.940 --> 41:14.260
that.

41:14.260 --> 41:15.860
So there's that.

41:15.860 --> 41:20.500
So all right, let's get back into video games and some actual headlines and stories.

41:21.300 --> 41:22.180
Hey Rob.

41:22.180 --> 41:22.680
What?

41:23.380 --> 41:25.620
I found pictures of you and Matt.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.740
I'm sure there's a lot of pictures of me and Matt.

41:28.740 --> 41:30.660
If you just hit print screen, you'll get one right now.

41:31.540 --> 41:35.620
When we recorded our podcast for at E3 2005.

41:37.220 --> 41:40.020
Oh, we didn't really do it at E3.

41:40.020 --> 41:40.900
Oh no, did we?

41:40.900 --> 41:42.100
We did it in the hotel room.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.300
Oh yeah, in the hotel room.

41:43.300 --> 41:43.700
We did.

41:43.700 --> 41:44.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:44.660 --> 41:48.580
I would say we might have done one in the media room, but yeah, it was the, which is,

41:49.140 --> 41:49.780
you know what?

41:51.620 --> 41:56.820
Does that make us the first, does that make us the first podcast to be done at E3?

41:56.820 --> 41:57.460
Maybe not.

41:58.340 --> 42:00.340
I don't want to stake a claim that's too big.

42:02.580 --> 42:05.940
The first podcast that's still around, probably.

42:06.660 --> 42:07.460
I don't know.

42:07.460 --> 42:07.940
I don't know.

42:07.940 --> 42:08.980
We're stubborn that way.

42:08.980 --> 42:16.020
Well, keep in mind, most shows didn't start until June 2006 when, uh, podcasting hit iTunes.

42:16.020 --> 42:19.220
So if we did a podcast about video games in 2005.

42:21.300 --> 42:21.800
Yeah.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.240
So anyway.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.520
Oh, Bobby says, Oh, June 2005.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.880
I always get the year wrong.

42:27.880 --> 42:28.200
All right.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.280
Then if it was 2005, nevermind.

42:30.280 --> 42:31.480
If it was 2004.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.560
I found 2006 as pictures just now.

42:36.040 --> 42:36.840
Actually, I take it back.

42:36.840 --> 42:37.800
That's California extreme.

42:39.320 --> 42:39.880
All right.

42:39.880 --> 42:40.120
Nope.

42:40.120 --> 42:40.440
It is.

42:40.440 --> 42:40.680
Nope.

42:40.680 --> 42:41.240
It's E3.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.880
All right, Jamie, you got to stop yelling about the random pictures.

42:43.880 --> 42:45.160
Just post them in the discord.

42:45.160 --> 42:46.200
Let's get back to the news.

42:46.200 --> 42:46.840
All right.

42:46.840 --> 42:49.000
Uh, Loki, kick us off with some news.

42:49.000 --> 42:55.480
So yeah, we had some good news about Activision.

42:55.480 --> 42:59.960
The good news is we're not talking about their sexual exploitation of their employees.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.440
Um, no, this time we're talking about that headline.

43:02.440 --> 43:06.440
We probably should mention that actually is that there's that settlement, right?

43:07.400 --> 43:07.900
Yes.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.280
So they settled.

43:10.360 --> 43:10.920
Mm hmm.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.200
Anyways, disclosed 18 million.

43:16.200 --> 43:19.640
I think a drop in the bucket for Bobby Kotick's salary last year.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.000
It's a few minutes.

43:23.000 --> 43:30.120
Um, so apparently they put out a memo to their employees, uh, letting them know that, uh,

43:30.120 --> 43:35.880
effective immediately, they are removing the company's vaccine mandate, meaning whether

43:35.880 --> 43:42.600
or not you are, um, vaccinated against COVID-19, you can go ahead and come back in.

43:43.320 --> 43:49.080
And because of that, there's already been a new, uh, walkout schedule for April 4th

43:49.080 --> 43:50.840
in response to the office plan.

43:50.840 --> 43:51.480
Good for them.

43:51.480 --> 43:53.240
According to the ABK workers Alliance.

43:53.240 --> 43:53.800
Good for them.

43:54.520 --> 43:59.400
That that is that that that needs to happen more often where they start sticking it loudly

43:59.400 --> 44:00.600
to their bosses.

44:00.600 --> 44:05.080
I do think there is a, um, sort of a footnote with this though that I want to make sure

44:05.080 --> 44:11.480
is clear because I believe studios within Activision Blizzard being one of them are

44:11.480 --> 44:15.880
allowed to dictate their own terms on the vaccine theme, because I have seen that Blizzard

44:15.880 --> 44:19.080
specifically is not waving that.

44:19.080 --> 44:25.400
So even though an Activision senior put that out there, probably for the, the, the, those

44:25.400 --> 44:30.920
under the Activision umbrella, um, the sub studios do get to make their own call on that.

44:31.480 --> 44:34.040
So I, I think it is an important clarification.

44:34.040 --> 44:38.600
So, um, because that means that like Blizzard would have no reason to participate in this

44:38.600 --> 44:43.000
walkout unless, unless there's other things going on that are, that are not a part of

44:43.000 --> 44:45.880
this report, um, that the walkout is going to cover.

44:45.880 --> 44:46.040
Yeah.

44:46.040 --> 44:49.800
They're trying to get everybody back in the office and then they say, we'll pivot if

44:49.800 --> 44:50.280
necessary.

44:50.280 --> 44:53.560
If we see a spike in cases, well, it's too late at that point.

44:54.920 --> 44:55.240
Right.

44:56.200 --> 44:57.320
But we're seeing this everywhere.

44:57.320 --> 45:01.640
This goes back to what I said earlier about E3 using COVID-19 as an excuse.

45:01.640 --> 45:07.480
Like literally the end, this is, this is an even better example of the industry going,

45:08.120 --> 45:10.840
nevermind COVID-19 is, is in the past.

45:10.840 --> 45:11.560
We beat it.

45:11.560 --> 45:12.120
We did it.

45:12.680 --> 45:15.560
We, uh, mission accomplished on the big banner.

45:15.560 --> 45:15.880
Yep.

45:15.880 --> 45:16.840
Mission accomplished.

45:19.560 --> 45:21.960
I laugh cause I don't know what other emotion to have.

45:21.960 --> 45:28.120
Um, but yeah, so, uh, good to the employees though, for, for holding out for what they

45:28.120 --> 45:29.320
believe in with all that.

45:29.320 --> 45:32.840
But, um, this is something that's happening at a lot of workplaces.

45:32.840 --> 45:37.880
You know, I'm very thankful in my day job, they are taking it very slowly.

45:37.880 --> 45:41.960
They're like dipping their toe in the water, uh, with this whole thing.

45:41.960 --> 45:46.280
And they've pretty much said, at least where I'm at, that telework can be a permanent

45:46.280 --> 45:51.800
option outside of necessary meetings and trainings that will be in person.

45:51.800 --> 45:54.520
But we don't even know what those look like yet or when those start.

45:55.480 --> 46:02.120
So, um, but there's a lot of workplaces, lot of, I'm sure a lot of people in chat

46:02.120 --> 46:06.360
with stories to share where they're like, Nope, we're all coming back to the office

46:06.360 --> 46:07.480
at least a couple of times a week.

46:08.040 --> 46:10.680
So mission accomplished.

46:12.200 --> 46:13.320
Yeah, we did it.

46:15.080 --> 46:15.640
It's over.

46:15.640 --> 46:19.160
We just have to cross our fingers and toes that as the virus continues to mutate, it

46:19.160 --> 46:20.440
mutates downwards.

46:20.440 --> 46:24.440
That's the ironically, I just got back from Vegas.

46:24.440 --> 46:28.280
So maybe my perspective is that is, we're taking that gamble.

46:28.280 --> 46:32.280
We're going to let it ride that COVID keeps mutating in a downward direction where it

46:32.280 --> 46:35.320
might be more transmissible, but it's, it's less effective.

46:35.320 --> 46:38.840
So let's just hope, you know, when it was after Omicron keeps going that way.

46:38.840 --> 46:41.080
Letting it ride is quite a Vegas take on that.

46:42.200 --> 46:42.700
Mm hmm.

46:44.520 --> 46:47.800
Sjo and Hunter Matt says a lot of companies are pushing to get folks back in.

46:47.800 --> 46:49.080
So this is a trend.

46:49.080 --> 46:52.520
My company is pushing folks back in at least a hybrid setup.

46:52.520 --> 46:57.000
It's interesting because there's a lot of talk about like, I know here where we live

46:57.000 --> 47:02.360
in Sacramento, which by the way, our city in the news today, I need to I need to mention

47:02.360 --> 47:05.320
this disgusting, not for a great reason.

47:06.360 --> 47:13.240
The latest shooting of the week club, I guess there's another sign that COVID-19 is

47:13.240 --> 47:16.840
apparently a thing of the past because now we're getting back to, you know, our every

47:16.840 --> 47:19.400
other day mass shooting in America headlines.

47:19.400 --> 47:19.900
Yeah.

47:20.280 --> 47:23.480
So unfortunately, one happened in Sacramento last night.

47:23.480 --> 47:26.520
Obviously, none of us were there even remotely involved with it.

47:26.520 --> 47:30.200
Nobody I know, and I don't think anybody we know was was involved with it.

47:30.200 --> 47:35.080
However, somebody somebody knows six of them were involved with it and lost their life

47:35.080 --> 47:35.960
last night.

47:35.960 --> 47:37.560
And it sucks.

47:37.560 --> 47:43.640
And I sit here and I go, when are we going to do something about it?

47:43.640 --> 47:45.960
But I already know the answer is never.

47:45.960 --> 47:48.840
And I just always repeatedly think of that onion headline.

47:49.480 --> 47:54.680
There is no possible way to stop this from happening asks or says country where this

47:54.680 --> 47:56.200
only thing routinely happens.

47:56.200 --> 47:56.520
Whatever.

47:56.520 --> 47:57.240
I totally butchered it.

47:57.240 --> 47:57.720
But you know what?

47:57.720 --> 48:01.560
You know what I'm talking about that onion always goes around when these things happen.

48:02.680 --> 48:08.520
So anyway, so what was I saying about Sacramento?

48:08.520 --> 48:09.000
I forget.

48:09.000 --> 48:09.500
Oh, yes.

48:10.280 --> 48:15.240
Downtown, like they're actually trying to push people to go back in the office because

48:15.240 --> 48:19.240
the businesses downtown are all hurting because everybody's working from home.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.480
And the real estate's drying up and all that.

48:21.480 --> 48:24.680
So it's it's very interesting to watch to see how this goes.

48:24.680 --> 48:25.400
I feel so bad.

48:25.400 --> 48:27.400
I know what the carbon impact has been like.

48:30.200 --> 48:31.560
I'd be curious on that, too.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.640
What that's look like.

48:33.640 --> 48:36.200
Those poor real estate investors, I swear to God.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.520
I feel so bad for them.

48:39.240 --> 48:43.400
Those poor, those poor, poor billionaire towers, poor things.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.800
Anyway, all right, let's move on.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.680
Let's talk about something from last week.

48:52.120 --> 48:57.000
Again, I don't love to talk about rumors here on Orange Lounge Radio, but some of them have

48:57.000 --> 49:00.840
a bit more smoke than others where it indicates there is fire.

49:00.840 --> 49:04.600
And sure enough, when we started last week's show, we talked about the PlayStation Plus

49:04.600 --> 49:05.480
rumors.

49:05.480 --> 49:07.000
What happened this week?

49:07.000 --> 49:08.520
It got confirmed.

49:08.520 --> 49:14.120
PlayStation is sort of taking on Game Pass, and a lot of it played out exactly how it

49:14.120 --> 49:14.680
was leaked.

49:15.560 --> 49:16.120
In a note.

49:16.120 --> 49:22.360
And ironically, yeah, it's ironically light, like how we kind of predicted to that they

49:22.360 --> 49:23.080
would steal ideas.

49:23.640 --> 49:24.040
Sort of.

49:24.040 --> 49:24.280
Yeah.

49:24.840 --> 49:29.720
So SIE President Jim Ryan on the PlayStation blog said today, we are pleased to share with

49:29.720 --> 49:33.160
you official news about changes coming to our subscription services.

49:33.160 --> 49:36.200
I love that official news about the change.

49:36.200 --> 49:38.040
The way that's phrased is actually kind of great.

49:38.600 --> 49:43.400
This June, we're bringing together PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now in an all new PlayStation

49:43.400 --> 49:47.320
Plus subscription service that provides more choice to customers across three membership

49:47.320 --> 49:48.680
tiers globally.

49:48.680 --> 49:50.760
So there's PlayStation Plus essential.

49:51.480 --> 49:58.680
What you have today, $9.99 a month or 60 bucks a year, online multiplayer, two free games

49:58.680 --> 50:02.200
a month, exclusive discounts and cloud storage.

50:03.400 --> 50:07.000
Yeah, they did slightly cut that corner, didn't they?

50:07.000 --> 50:09.720
But I think haven't they been on two or were they on three?

50:10.920 --> 50:11.640
I don't know.

50:11.960 --> 50:13.880
It's it's pitiful.

50:15.160 --> 50:21.160
Well, to be fair, a lot of the games that they've offered have been kind of silly anyway.

50:21.160 --> 50:22.840
Like what was what was the one?

50:22.840 --> 50:27.400
It was the one that was a launch game for the PS5 Godfall.

50:27.400 --> 50:28.680
Was that what it was called?

50:28.680 --> 50:32.680
And like they did the it in the demo.

50:32.680 --> 50:36.600
Yeah, it was like the demo enhanced or whatever was like the giveaway.

50:36.600 --> 50:37.640
So yeah.

50:39.320 --> 50:42.520
Oh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says two PS4, one PS5.

50:42.520 --> 50:44.120
So yes, it's at three now.

50:44.120 --> 50:47.720
But, you know, three games in concept.

50:49.640 --> 50:51.480
Now there's PlayStation Plus extra.

50:52.520 --> 50:53.880
It's a little extra.

50:53.880 --> 50:57.880
It's going to cost you $14.99 a month or $99 a year.

50:57.880 --> 50:59.720
What does that five bucks a month get you?

50:59.720 --> 51:07.560
An extra 400 of the most enjoyable PS4 and PS5 games, including blockbuster hits from

51:07.560 --> 51:11.080
the PlayStation Studios catalog and third party partners.

51:11.080 --> 51:14.520
Games in the extra tier are downloadable for play.

51:15.320 --> 51:18.680
So it's kind of like in that regard, it's kind of like Game Pass.

51:18.680 --> 51:21.240
You don't stream them, you download them and play them.

51:21.880 --> 51:29.160
It also sounds a little bit like that PlayStation 5 library of PlayStation 4 games that they

51:29.160 --> 51:33.080
had at the launch, which they I would assume still have actually.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.160
So I still don't own a PS5.

51:35.160 --> 51:35.720
I couldn't tell you.

51:36.920 --> 51:39.160
And there's going to be PlayStation Plus premium.

51:40.040 --> 51:48.040
$17.99 a month or $120 a year, twice the price of PlayStation Plus premium.

51:49.000 --> 51:57.640
All the benefits from essential and extra with another 340 games, which includes PS3

51:57.640 --> 52:04.520
games that are available via cloud streaming and a catalog of beloved classic games available

52:04.520 --> 52:09.480
both streaming and download options for the original PlayStation PS2.

52:10.040 --> 52:13.320
And here's the surprise PSP generations.

52:14.360 --> 52:18.360
That one was not in the leaks that PSP would be included in this.

52:18.360 --> 52:22.280
No word about Vita, but we all know how Sony treats the Vita.

52:24.120 --> 52:24.600
What?

52:24.600 --> 52:25.960
We never had a console named the Vita.

52:26.680 --> 52:32.520
Now it is mentioned this offers cloud streaming access for original PlayStation PS2, PSP and

52:32.520 --> 52:38.280
PS4 games and extra and premium tier markets where PlayStation now is currently available.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.920
Because in select markets, there isn't cloud streaming.

52:40.920 --> 52:45.160
So you get something called PlayStation Plus Deluxe, which is a little lower than premium,

52:45.160 --> 52:51.160
but you still get the downloadable PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PSP games for play.

52:53.160 --> 52:54.200
So there it is.

52:54.200 --> 52:59.800
It's basically a monthly fee to access retro games in a catalog.

53:00.360 --> 53:06.920
I really wish Sony had gone the full Microsoft route and allowed you to play games that you

53:06.920 --> 53:11.080
still own on disk because many of us do for free.

53:11.720 --> 53:17.880
Because now this really shows there is no fucking reason you can't play your PlayStation

53:17.880 --> 53:21.800
and PlayStation 2 games, at least on your PlayStation 5.

53:22.520 --> 53:26.360
Well, I thought there was a reason like the drive doesn't work with those disks.

53:26.360 --> 53:27.960
Okay, let's just say that that's the case.

53:28.520 --> 53:32.680
There's so many games I own on the PlayStation 3, for example.

53:32.680 --> 53:36.520
It sucks that I can't play those digitally.

53:36.520 --> 53:37.400
I own them.

53:37.400 --> 53:39.320
Let me have the PSP.

53:39.320 --> 53:42.840
Let me have Dark Sakura do her story because it's really a yin and yang with this story

53:42.840 --> 53:43.080
here.

53:43.080 --> 53:46.760
And I don't I want to make sure we cover both before we open it up to the viewer comments.

53:46.760 --> 53:47.720
So Dark Sakura.

53:47.720 --> 53:57.480
Yeah, so it looks like that the rumor going on right now about the whole cloud thing has

53:57.480 --> 54:02.120
to do with PS3 emulation and how difficult it is with the cell processor.

54:02.840 --> 54:07.960
Although the rumor out there is that they are still working on that emulation.

54:07.960 --> 54:13.000
That is just what's been the more difficult thing to get across.

54:13.000 --> 54:24.360
There is another statement on here that saying that with what they were missing from that

54:24.360 --> 54:28.520
announcement was addressing the issue of how they were going to emulate it and why they

54:28.520 --> 54:31.240
were only going to leave PS3 stuff as cloud-based.

54:31.240 --> 54:34.360
But again, that's the rumor that it may have to do with the cell processor.

54:37.880 --> 54:39.960
I'm getting some comments in chat now.

54:39.960 --> 54:47.720
DJ Rama S says, so the top tier to get access to PS1, 2, and PSP games in a possible download

54:47.720 --> 54:52.280
stream format, even though you may have these games anyway, that is a crock of shit.

54:53.800 --> 54:55.720
That's from DJ Rama S in our chat room.

54:56.920 --> 55:00.280
Mishkins in our chat says, yeah, nah, I'm not even going to bother.

55:00.280 --> 55:02.200
Lol, I'll stay with what I have already.

55:03.240 --> 55:06.920
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the thing to realize about a company doing an emulation

55:06.920 --> 55:11.640
versus a group like RPC S3 or whatever, is that one is called, we have a viewer who works

55:11.640 --> 55:16.520
in that team, is that a company needs to also support it with customer service reps.

55:16.520 --> 55:20.040
An independent emulator team can say, use at your own risk.

55:20.600 --> 55:20.920
Sure.

55:22.200 --> 55:26.520
But the independent emulator team has shown that it's possible.

55:27.160 --> 55:31.880
Although I'm well aware that the RPC S3 doesn't run everything.

55:31.880 --> 55:35.560
I think there's a chart and it runs like 60% ish.

55:35.560 --> 55:39.800
Sorry if I got the number wrong, 60% ish of games start to finish.

55:39.800 --> 55:42.360
And then there's others that it runs with issues.

55:42.360 --> 55:47.720
And I imagine it probably has to do with that cell processor, because let's be real.

55:47.720 --> 55:52.360
There's a lot of PlayStation 3 games that probably don't use many features that are,

55:52.360 --> 55:58.120
because there was so much that was ported between the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

55:58.120 --> 56:00.920
There's probably a lot of stuff that barely touches,

56:00.920 --> 56:05.240
like some of the more advanced processing features of the PlayStation 3.

56:05.320 --> 56:12.680
And probably it's the Sony first party games that obviously tie into that a little more.

56:12.680 --> 56:19.240
And that's the stuff that Sony most wants and needs to get working on an official emulator

56:19.240 --> 56:23.720
for them to want to release something like that.

56:23.720 --> 56:25.800
And that I do understand.

56:25.800 --> 56:31.080
And I didn't look at the list of compatibility and specifically like, where does God of War

56:31.080 --> 56:35.640
and the Sony exclusives, where do they all fit in in the compatibility meter?

56:35.640 --> 56:41.000
Because I would imagine the problem is that the Sony games are probably the hardest to emulate.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.800
If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but that's what's probably the hang up right now.

56:47.560 --> 56:49.800
I'm not mad about the cloud streaming.

56:49.800 --> 56:52.840
And granted, maybe my perspective has completely changed

56:52.840 --> 56:54.840
because I don't have a bandwidth cap anymore.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.840
I'm fully willing to say that.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.360
However, I do think it's kind of shit.

57:01.080 --> 57:06.120
That if I still have PlayStation 3, 2, and 1 discs, they do nothing for me at this point.

57:06.120 --> 57:09.160
If I don't still have working consoles that are 3, 2, or 1.

57:10.120 --> 57:14.440
That I ought to be able to put those discs in my PlayStation 5

57:14.440 --> 57:18.280
and get the digital assets for it, just like I do on Xbox.

57:19.080 --> 57:26.760
I do want to know though, how were they emulating it on the cloud unless they have some sort of,

57:27.480 --> 57:32.040
I'm just trying to think of how they're pulling it off through something cloud-based.

57:32.040 --> 57:36.600
It's running on like a PS3 farm type of thing that specializes in that hardware.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.800
That's kind of what I was thinking too.

57:37.800 --> 57:42.760
But it's still just like, if they're going to go that far,

57:44.440 --> 57:53.480
why not just put more of the effort into improving their emulation, creating a virtual processor?

57:53.480 --> 57:58.040
And remember this, and I think it's the same, go ahead.

57:58.040 --> 57:58.680
Sorry.

57:58.680 --> 58:01.720
I was just saying, it's probably the same reason that they're not emulating,

58:02.520 --> 58:05.160
that like Planet Harrier still has trouble being emulated.

58:06.520 --> 58:10.600
And here's the thing, and I fully own the comments I've made before about,

58:10.600 --> 58:14.920
I do believe the PS3 ought to be emulatable on a PlayStation 5,

58:14.920 --> 58:17.400
because they're able to emulate it on computers,

58:17.400 --> 58:20.520
and all the progress that the independent teams have made.

58:20.520 --> 58:29.640
However, I do understand that the PS3 was incredibly fucking advanced for its time.

58:30.200 --> 58:32.120
Incredibly advanced for its time.

58:32.680 --> 58:40.280
Don't forget, the US military was getting PlayStation 3s to use that other OS feature

58:40.280 --> 58:44.200
to make those PlayStations do other things, because of the value that you were getting.

58:44.200 --> 58:45.720
Like the network Linux systems.

58:45.720 --> 58:46.680
Yeah, yeah.

58:46.760 --> 58:50.120
That's why it was such a big fucking deal when Sony took that other OS thing out.

58:50.840 --> 58:53.320
So I do understand.

58:53.320 --> 58:58.440
Yes, the PlayStation 3 was a lot more advanced at the time than I think people remember.

58:59.320 --> 59:05.720
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, would anyone here be interested in a PS5

59:05.720 --> 59:10.280
complete that has the PS3 cell processor inside the PS5?

59:10.280 --> 59:14.360
That way, they're no longer emulating, they are just running the hardware.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.920
Yes, I would love that.

59:16.920 --> 59:18.840
I don't have a PS5 yet.

59:18.840 --> 59:24.280
If they were to do a hardware refresh later this year, and they're going to do that,

59:24.280 --> 59:32.040
and if it will run my old PS3 disks and my old PS2 disks and PS1 disks, fuck yeah,

59:32.040 --> 59:33.400
I want that machine.

59:33.400 --> 59:36.120
That's the machine I wanted kind of from the beginning.

59:36.120 --> 59:40.840
But okay, maybe, you know, but now that it's been a couple years and chips have probably

59:40.840 --> 59:45.560
But now that it's been a couple years and chips have probably come down in price and so forth,

59:45.560 --> 59:47.400
yeah, I would actually love that machine.

59:48.200 --> 59:51.480
And even if it's the same price a PS5 is today, I would pay it.

59:52.520 --> 59:54.680
An all-in-one PlayStation, it's worth it.

59:55.640 --> 59:58.120
SD100Matt says, I would camp out for that machine.

59:58.120 --> 59:58.620
Same.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.640
I would be glad I waited.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.520
So we'll see.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:10.680
It'd be like the, instead of just the station, it would be like the play universe or something.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.600
Just yeah, like the PlayStation without a number.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:14.920
I don't know.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:19.800
That might be a little silly, but I just, the PlayStation all, I don't know.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.880
I would love that.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.760
I really, really would.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.840
But I think the hardware refresh we're going to get is going to be centered around the

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:33.720
VR2 because I don't see why that is not Sony's big push this holiday is that new VR2.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.960
We've already seen them sowing the seeds for that.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.920
And I think we'll get that confirmed in June.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.520
So with whatever media event ends up happening.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.920
So, um, Sia Tabiri says the PlayStation hub.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.200
Hey, bonus if it has a PlayStation TV inside of it too.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.880
So my Vita games can get some love.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:53.800
Absolutely.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.320
Is this stuff that you like take in the morning to make yourself healthier?

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.520
That's a Vita min.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.760
All right.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.880
Let's move on.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.520
In other news.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:06.920
Oh yeah.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.600
April Fool's day was this week, right?

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.080
Everyone.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.040
And there was no, I skipped that day.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:12.520
Sorry.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.560
Well, there was, there was, I know we've all had our fill with April Fool's day and there's

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:22.840
a lot of people that don't like, there there's certain things on April Fool's day that aren't

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.880
funny and I don't need to retrend all that ground here, but there's a lot of things that

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.380
aren't funny.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.720
Um, and a lot of companies get in on it and they're also not funny, but some companies

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.880
do it and it's kind of cute.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.000
Like it's kind of cute.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.640
And I go, okay, if we had cute shit today, this day wouldn't bother me so much.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.880
Such as the dead by daylight one was pretty good.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:47.080
That dead by daylight one, um, that had the walking dead coming to it or whatever.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.360
Um, the Frasier pinball table was fucking funny.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.320
Like that was good.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.200
That was really good.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.160
That's awesome.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.560
And then Loki, I know, I know you have two stories here.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.880
Can you read the one about twitches April Fool's day?

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.200
Cause I actually thought this was one of the better pranks.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.240
Yeah, that's the thing with April Fool's stuff.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.520
Like I hate, hate when they have like April Fool's pranks.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.720
They're like, well, I wish that some of that was true.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.040
You know?

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:16.840
Um, so they, they had this kind of these, uh, different channels that they introduced.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.960
So like, for example, one of them was pizza time.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:26.120
It's everything about pizza, eating pizza, talking about pizza, cooking pizza, um, all

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:31.000
that stuff, silent reading where you just watch people, I guess, read.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.680
I heard one girl had like 3000 viewers in that category.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.480
But it's funny.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.520
If I had been home and not in Vegas, I would have totally done a Bible reading stream

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.640
where I was re reading the Bible for y'all.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:50.200
Um, character creator where you would, you know, spend hours making a character and a

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.400
character creator.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.080
Honestly, Shane would be a streamer if that was a real category.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.640
I dark would have those streams every week.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:04.440
I would like to think I'll pick a game and make a character and never play the game.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.240
Chores, odd jobs and errands.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:12.200
So it's, it's you cleaning your house, I guess, or doing mundane tasks.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.440
They had one that was called literally just chatting.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.160
There's no cameras, no mics, no stream.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.680
You just, it's just a chat room.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.160
That's great.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.920
Hi, AOL.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.760
I kind of wish some of these would stay around.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.880
But I get that it's it's silly and maybe not the stuff that

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:32.680
tweets the time.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.640
I think character creators should stay.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.360
I really do.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.480
I think that will stay.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.240
But whatever.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.760
See a Tiberian chat says one of the movie reviewers I followed did a comparison between

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.280
the book that inspired the room.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.880
Oh, I don't I don't know if that's about the book reading category or just a different

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:50.280
comment.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.200
But I thought that was about the book reading category.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.640
So there's that.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.400
Anyway, I thought that was all very funny.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.960
So yeah, I'm kind of sad.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.240
I miss that, to be honest.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.040
So that's, that's the cute sort of April Fool's Day prank.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.800
And, you know, as far as gaming goes, never forget.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:13.160
The game that probably has transformed the gaming industry more than anything else in

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.080
the past 10 years started as an April Fool's Day prank.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.240
Pokemon Go.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:19.960
Goat Simulator.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.460
My friend.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.900
Pokemon Go started as a Google Maps.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.220
April Fool's Day joke.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:26.860
Don't forget.

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:27.660
Well, yeah.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:28.620
What did they do for?

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.860
I didn't see what Google Maps did.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:31.660
Did they do anything?

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.260
Oh, I didn't see what Google did this year.

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.540
No, I mean, I was kind of busy.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.820
Well, actually, my favorite dating sim started off as a joke, but I don't think it was an

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:38.620
April Fool's joke.

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.580
Now, that'd be funny as a dating sim baked in the Google Maps.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:49.980
Oh, I see a Tiberi says it was an April Fool's prank he was describing overall.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:50.540
I get it.

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.260
I get it.

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:53.500
So very nice.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:53.820
All right.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.580
Anyway, what else?

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.420
What else was going on on Twitch, Loki?

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:03.500
Well, apparently the Twitch had the pause their boost feature.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.740
Because it allows you to boost certain streams.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.820
I think you have to pay for that to promote them.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:17.100
And porn ended up there on the front page.

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.200
Whoops.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.700
Uh, so they had to stop doing that.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:26.540
Whoops.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:26.780
How?

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:31.500
Why could I mean, like, porn shouldn't be on Twitch anyway.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:36.460
So even if it got boosted, like, what's the I mean, I know it doesn't look great for Twitch,

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:39.340
but like, shouldn't they be kind of screening that out?

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.500
It shouldn't even be on the platform anyway.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.820
Like, is this really going to stop that?

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:45.420
How's how's that?

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:51.980
Like, I don't know how it's probably a lot of these unknown streams, like they create

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:54.700
brand new account and just post porn on there.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:58.780
And then boost the channel to be like, haha, it's on the front page.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.140
I don't know what it takes.

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:07.420
Like, if you have the paper boost, and then you also have to have like so many viewers.

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.340
I mean, I don't know.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.180
I mean, like in the screenshot here, let's see.

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.660
How many people do they have watching?

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.460
Uh, several thousand.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.020
Let's see here.

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:18.940
I can't see.

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:23.740
It does not say what it is.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:28.140
And they put, you know, obviously that the game they're playing is like Grand Theft Auto

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:28.780
5 or something.

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:29.580
So.

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:31.740
Interesting.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.020
They're just they're just going to need to screen the people that they allow to boost

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.580
a little more carefully, like somebody at Twitch.

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:43.020
I know it's a big job, but somebody at Twitch ought to be watching any stream, at least

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:47.580
for a little bit before it becomes an affiliate and then only allow the affiliate stuff to

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:48.620
get boosted.

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:50.220
Like, that's really how it should go.

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:52.700
I don't know.

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:55.980
But I mean, it's not going to stop everything, but it'll stop a good chunk of it.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:57.600
Yeah.

01:06:58.460 --> 01:06:59.100
So I don't know.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.300
As soon as the terrible idea anyway, period.

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:04.460
All right.

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:09.260
By the way, I texted Shane a question just to follow up on the I said, I need to know

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:14.380
for OLR, if Twitch's April Fool's Day character creator category was real, would you be a

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.420
full time streamer?

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.900
And the answer is yes.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:22.140
I have enough games with character creators that I could easily make it a full time job.

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:27.100
No, and nobody was surprised.

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.060
Nobody was surprised.

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.700
I think I think they should keep it.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:31.820
All right.

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:36.460
Anyway, let's move on to our next story.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.020
Who's on this?

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:37.740
I think it's me.

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.100
And I think this is a this is a very interesting story as well.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:48.620
This has to do with Bungie and going after a group that their day needs to fucking come

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:49.100
already.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:52.860
And I'm talking about copyright trolls on YouTube.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:08:00.060
We all know YouTube's copyright claim system gets inundated with bogus takedown requests.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:05.740
And we know the worst part about YouTube, a platform I've been critical of on this program.

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:09.740
That doesn't mean I won't use it, or that I haven't even posted content on there or

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:10.780
won't ever in the future.

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:16.540
But I'm allowed to say this is the worst part of YouTube is that YouTube airs against the

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.100
creators.

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:22.700
Always, because they allow these bogus takedown requests to go through.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.820
And then the creator has to appeal it every time.

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:32.300
Well, maybe it's gonna maybe finally some comeuppance is going to come for these copyright

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:32.700
trolls.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:34.380
And it's thanks to Bungie.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:42.940
The game studio sued 10 anonymous people for allegedly leveling false DMCA claims against

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:46.620
Destiny 2 creators on YouTube, even Bungie itself.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:54.220
There is a hole in YouTube's DMA security, according to the company that let anyone claim

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:59.420
to represent a rights holder, letting any person anywhere abuse the system to suit their

01:08:59.420 --> 01:08:59.900
own ends.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:05.580
Apparently, there was a Gmail account created in mid March that was supposed to mimic the

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.820
developers copyright partner CSC.

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:14.300
They then issued DMCA takedown notices falsely claiming to represent Bungie, trying to fool

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.460
creators with another account that insisted the first one was fraudulent.

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:26.220
So YouTube didn't bother to investigate at all and slapped producers with copyright strikes,

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.140
and people had to remove videos.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:31.740
Now, YouTube has corrected the error since.

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:36.540
But let's be real, this is only because Bungie got involved and made a phone call.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:38.940
Exactly.

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:44.140
They thankfully, since YouTube and Google are affiliated, they were also able to suspend

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.580
those Gmail accounts.

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.740
So not very bright on the part of the YouTube trolls.

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:54.140
But Bungie called it a circular loop of support.

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.580
Oh, yeah, this is crazy, too.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:10:02.540
Google said they had the global finance director email key personnel, and Google still would

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.020
not share info to identify the fraudsters.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:11.500
So Bungie did a DMCA subpoena to help identify the attackers and punish them.

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:16.300
Damages up to $150,000 for every false takedown notice.

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:23.820
So yeah, YouTube in a comment said we take abuse of our copyright takedown products and

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.660
abuse of our copyright takedown process seriously and terminate them.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:28.300
No, you don't.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:32.620
And terminate tens of thousands of accounts every year for violating our policies, which

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.900
prohibits submitting false information in a takedown request.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.700
We'll continue our work to prevent abuse of our systems.

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:42.860
And we're committed to taking appropriate action against those who knowingly misuse

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:50.620
our tools, then reveal her, expose her, drag her YouTube, tell Bungie who it is, give them

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:55.420
everything they need to know without having to go through the courts and mess up that

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.220
system.

01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:00.540
I, for one, am glad that Bungie is putting their foot down on behalf of their content.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:06.140
This is this is big ups on Bungie because they are sticking up for their content creators

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.420
who have stuck by them covering Destiny 2 this whole time.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:13.740
So let's let's give kudos to Bungie because they're they're pouring money into their

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.980
legal team to make this happen.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.180
And maybe change will finally happen because of what Bungie is doing.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:25.500
So I can't wait to see these YouTube copyright trolls get their comeuppance.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:29.580
Then again, I thought the Twitch hate raiders were supposed to get their comeuppance.

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:32.060
And I haven't heard anything following on that.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.580
But I suppose it's supposed to be important to the front page now with boost.

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:42.540
Well, honestly, honestly, I will take that any day of the week versus the hate raids.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.100
Give give me porn.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:49.500
Honestly, porn, porn, porn, porn all day, every day versus the hate raids.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.820
So all right.

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.260
By the way, going back to the earlier story, but an important footnote, Bobby Blackwolf

01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:02.460
in our chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network points out Google declined to participate

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.540
in April Fool's 2022.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.420
That's interesting.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:06.940
They usually go all out.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.460
I wonder if they were worried the current state of the world and, you know, everything

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.780
going on with Ukraine and COVID and stuff.

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.420
Maybe they just decided it wasn't a good taste this year.

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:15.920
I don't know.

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.020
It's interesting.

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:25.580
Tiger Claw in chat says, I wish YouTube did something about people posting spoilers on

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.780
the recommend section.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.260
Oh, is that of course, it's a thing.

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.540
Why am I sitting here asking?

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.060
That's of course, it's a fucking thing.

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:37.740
I just I've never I also don't follow a lot of movies and I don't watch a lot of YouTube's

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.780
about movie culture.

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:41.420
And that's so I've just never fallen in that trap.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:44.140
But that doesn't surprise me, sadly.

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.220
Yikes on bikes.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.940
Mike Deaf says that's more on the creators.

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:54.940
It is, but that doesn't mean that action shouldn't be taken against them for not using spoiler

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:55.580
tags.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:00.780
Like there should be spoiler tags that then prevent your video from being advertised in

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:01.340
certain ways.

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:05.980
So but yeah, I bet some not your video.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:06.480
Yeah.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:13.260
So tire classes people on YouTube are posting spoilers from Sonic the Hedgehog two and the

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.020
movie isn't out in the US yet because it came out in Europe.

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:19.420
That's a slippery slope, though.

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.420
So technically, the spoilers, they're in bad taste.

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:25.260
But the movie is out in Europe.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.420
You know, the world doesn't revolve around the US.

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:29.500
We like to think it does, but it doesn't.

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:34.060
So but there should be there should be if YouTube had a spoiler tag, which I thought

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:34.620
it did.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:38.540
If you do that a spoiler tag, and then those videos wouldn't show up in algorithms, that

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.060
would be a good solution.

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:43.020
Because people in Europe ought to be able to talk freely about it.

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:44.220
I didn't know the movie came out.

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.460
Why did I think that movie was still like months away?

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:50.460
So it's next week.

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.860
I showed you how much I follow movies anymore.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:14:00.060
I do really want to see the Jamie Lee Curtis, Michelle Yo, everything everywhere all at

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:00.540
once.

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.260
I think it's called.

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:02.860
I really want to see that.

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:05.820
I haven't really wanted to see a movie in a very long time.

01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:10.460
I really want to see that because a Michelle Yo is a goddess.

01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:12.940
B Jamie Lee Curtis also goddess.

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:15.340
C and she was very nice in person.

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:21.500
I did not know that kid from the Goonies got back into acting, but apparently he's in that

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:22.220
movie.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.420
Which kid from the Goonies?

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.460
He was his name, Data.

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:28.620
Oh, yeah.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.580
Yeah, he played that character.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:32.460
Yes, yes.

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.940
So and he's in that movie.

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:39.500
And there's a whole piece I saw on Apple News or something about how he's come back to acting

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.620
after 40 years.

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:43.020
And just the cinematography in that movie looks really good.

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:48.300
So, oh, Tiger class says K Hui Quan.

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.660
I'm sorry if I mispronounced that.

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:49.820
Thank you.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.060
Did you?

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:51.500
Rama said the name there.

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.460
Tiger points out he was also short round in Temple of Doom.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:55.980
So true.

01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.500
Yeah, very true.

01:14:58.620 --> 01:14:59.580
Anyway, Dr. Jones.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.580
Yeah, I think it's cool that he came back after all these years.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.660
But anyway, I really want to see that movie.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:07.420
So maybe I'll go to the movies next week.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:07.740
We'll see.

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:09.260
I'd like to go.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:13.420
I want to see that terrible Morbius movie just because I love bad movies.

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:16.860
I have not heard a good thing about that movie.

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.220
Isn't Jared Leto in that movie?

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:21.260
Yeah, apparently he was the good part of it.

01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:23.260
I cannot fucking stand it.

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:24.860
And here's the ironic thing.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:29.820
It has nothing to do with all these stories about what a horror he is on set and all these

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:30.060
things.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:32.620
I mean, not to discount any of that.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:36.540
I'm just saying I've never liked him as an actor, period.

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:39.980
So I just I have no interest in that movie.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.980
But I am like you, Dark Sakura.

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:46.940
When I hear a movie is a gigantic fucking train wreck of a film, it does make me a little

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:47.980
more interested in it.

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.620
It's not in a good way, though.

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:57.420
It's just in a just like, I don't think it's in like, it's so funny because they're trying

01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.460
to take themselves seriously.

01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.260
But it's awful.

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:01.980
But like, it's more of just like, it's just awful.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:08.620
S2100 Matt in chat says, speaking of movies, so sad about about Bruce Willis.

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:09.180
Yes, it is.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:11.980
That is very, very granted, though.

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.580
He's been acting for a long time.

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.540
I'd say he's had a pretty great career.

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:26.140
Yeah, there's there's a lot of films to go back and celebrate, but it's it's still hard

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:30.620
when you know, one of the all time greats, you know, has to walk away, not of their own

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.820
decision, essentially.

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:37.900
Well, whether or not it's a great or anything, it's it's a hard illness to have.

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:38.620
Oh, sure.

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:39.120
Sure.

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:41.660
I draw a lot of comparisons to Tim Curry.

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:46.460
In that regard, you know, Tim Curry should have been able to make a lot more movies.

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:50.140
Unfortunately, he had the stroke and we all know he hasn't been the same since.

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:55.340
It's a blessing that we've been able to see Tim Curry in limited capacity and things like

01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:56.380
animation.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:00.780
I know he did a cameo in that Rocky Horror remake, and that type of stuff.

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:08.780
But I think we all know and I hope that Bruce Willis will be able to still be able to show

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:10.060
up here and there.

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:12.700
But I imagine he's already been doing that.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:13.980
He can't anymore.

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.180
It really he's beyond being able to act anymore.

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:17.500
That's really sad.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:22.220
He's been doing a lot of like straight to Netflix type videos and they've been all bad.

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.660
And he's been no anime.

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:28.460
And and that was the thought is like he's got to have something, you know, up with him

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:31.580
because they've been you could see him with an earpiece that they're feeding him lines

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.340
and stuff, and he's just not kind of there.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:37.340
And like that was kind of like, is he had dementia and what's going on?

01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.620
And they were close.

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:44.060
But yeah, he's done a lot of movies, like a lot, a lot, a lot of movies recently, which

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:48.060
is probably just trying to get the money for his kids, which is noble by all means.

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:50.860
But yeah, I think he's done.

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:55.340
I think it's just it's this time to retire.

01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:00.620
Well, then be sure to buy the fifth element on Blu-ray and the six cents on something

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:03.900
is that get get him those residual checks if you.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:04.140
Right.

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:04.620
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.060
Those movies, by all means.

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:06.300
Yeah.

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.100
Support that stuff.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.620
Don't support the stuff that's on Netflix where it's just like clearly phoned in.

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:12.700
They have body doubles and all sorts of craziness.

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:15.020
Not that stuff.

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.620
And every Christmas, watch Die Hard.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:20.540
All right.

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:22.540
Anyhow, you know what I watch on Christmas, though?

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:24.780
I watch Batman Returns.

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.340
That is my favorite.

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.220
I watch Gremlins.

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:32.460
OK, anyway, let's move on from Christmas to our next story, Dark Sakura.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:44.140
OK, so in other news, there is a rumor I'm going to put this on the rumor mill, but they

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:47.660
think that eight Xbox Game Pass games have been leaked online.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:54.780
And so the list, I mean, it is a it's all the same family of games except for one.

01:18:54.780 --> 01:19:00.460
It's Call of Duty, Black Ops Cold War, Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, Diablo

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:06.300
2 Resurrected and then Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes,

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:13.660
The Phantom Pain and Metal Gear Survive, which I mean, none of those are really surprising.

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:19.660
I mean, maybe the Konami ones are, but they're soon to be acquisition of Konami.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:26.060
But at any rate, they're leaked for this month for April.

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.780
So we'll see if it actually comes to pass.

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:29.580
They call it used to have.

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:34.380
Yeah, that makes sense because they own Activision or they're going to be owning Activision.

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.620
Yeah, the first half makes a lot of sense.

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.740
And Diablo 2 Resurrected will make a lot of people happy, that's for sure.

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.100
Yeah, including me ish, although.

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.140
I still know you like your Diablo.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:46.620
I do.

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:52.940
But you also know I have not had the battle net thing installed since a lot of this Bobby

01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:53.740
Kotick stuff.

01:19:53.740 --> 01:20:02.860
You know, it was still not I did buy Diablo 2 Resurrected, but I got worse after that.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:07.660
And I just I haven't been able to play it in good faith now that Microsoft's in the picture.

01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.020
I don't know.

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:14.380
Again, you kind of have to there's bad and good and everything, I suppose.

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:16.060
I don't know if I'll end up playing it or not.

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:19.740
I probably will, because at least I see the finish line now.

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:25.020
I see that there will come a day where Microsoft, well, I guess legislators are trying to stop

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:25.500
it.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.420
And oh, that we didn't get to that.

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:29.580
I think that was two weeks ago on the canceled show.

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:34.140
But did you guys hear that stuff about how some of the senators and I think Bernie was

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:39.900
one of them and some of the other senators came together to basically say they oppose

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.620
the Microsoft Activision Blizzard thing.

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.540
But it's not for the reason you think.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:48.380
It doesn't sound like it's for the reason that Microsoft would be too big a player.

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:49.660
They're pissed off.

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:54.460
Basically, the Bobby Kotick's getting a payday and that all these executives are getting

01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.180
a huge payday out of this and they don't deserve it.

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.220
I know that was a thing in the news recently.

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:00.460
Yeah.

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:06.380
And I'm like, OK, like as much as I think I'm cool with Microsoft, because like Microsoft

01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:12.140
taking them over means the end of Bobby Kotick and that part I support.

01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:14.940
I think the senators raise an excellent point.

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:17.580
Why are they getting all this money?

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:21.580
I think it made a lot of the rest of us feel dirty about this whole acquisition.

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:28.140
So, fuck, if we get if we get both sides of this, like Microsoft can get them and the

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.220
senators are able to somehow cancel the payout.

01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:32.620
I don't even know if that can happen or if it would even work.

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.300
But in my brain, it's going to.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.300
That would be the best possible scenario.

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:38.380
That would be amazing.

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:39.340
That would be amazing.

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.740
That would make me proud to be an American.

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:44.140
For once.

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:45.740
At least we have something at that point.

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:56.140
Anyway, but yes, the Konami inclusions, I would say they are surprising, but at the same

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.460
time, I also am not surprised.

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:04.700
OK, we all know Konami's business is in slot machines, pachinko, gambling, you know, our

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.580
machines, machines in arcades and casinos.

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:10.140
They've seen the rights for their games for terrible sequels.

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:15.900
Yeah, as far as their video games go, it is about whoring, literally whoring them out

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:19.820
on the corner for whoever's willing to turn tricks for them.

01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:26.140
And if that is putting them into classic game archives to release on consoles like

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:29.180
the Castlevania Advanced Collection, then so be it.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:37.340
If that is to whore a good Metal Gear Solid game and some bad ones for Microsoft Game

01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:39.020
Pass to get some checks there, too.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:39.740
Hey, great.

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:45.180
Will I download Metal Gear Survive just because it's free and I can?

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:50.300
And like I told Dark Soccer earlier and the rest of you, I will play I will go not only

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:52.220
go see a movie because it's so bad.

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:54.460
I will play a game because it's so bad.

01:22:54.460 --> 01:23:00.540
So I'm looking forward to playing Metal Gear Survive because it won't cost me anything.

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:03.900
That Avatar game that came out like an age ago.

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.540
And I actually enjoyed it.

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:13.580
Yeah, kind of Questbuster in chat does want to point out it's not just executive pay either

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.900
with the senators versus Activision thing.

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:21.340
They were concerned that the deal, quote, threatens worker led demands for accountability.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.820
I would be it's a valid concern.

01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:31.260
I think Microsoft has replied to that concern because they have explicitly said they do

01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:33.340
not intend to union bust or any of that.

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:38.060
But I understand that's Microsoft and that doesn't reflect what's actually happening

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:41.020
at Activision now until the merger take place.

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:44.620
So I think that is a good conversation to be had.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:45.120
Yes.

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:46.160
So.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:51.340
And Dark Tetsuya says there is still that Turtles collection coming.

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:53.580
Yes, Konami hoard that out too.

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.020
That doesn't make it bad.

01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:56.780
It's not does it.

01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.140
It doesn't mean it's bad.

01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:03.020
I'm just saying Konami is selling them on the street for money and okay.

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:09.340
But that is all Konami is interested in doing with their retro titles at this point.

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.060
It's pretty clear.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.000
Anyhow.

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.140
Let's move on.

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.540
Who's got the next story?

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:19.500
I think it's a Loki.

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:21.040
Yep.

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:22.220
All right.

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:29.260
So let's talk a little bit about some possible updates to games because we talked a little

01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:35.660
bit how PlayStation Plus is changing and making you get into PlayStation now, which I really

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:36.160
hate.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:42.640
But Xbox is actually talking about getting a games pass or a family plan option.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.920
So you will have to purchase game pass for every single member of the family.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.720
You'll be able to actually convert it over now.

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.160
I'm not sure they mentioned a cost on that, but I like the idea, especially, you know,

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.800
a lot of my kids that have access to a bunch of games.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.260
So.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:01.760
Cool.

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.760
I'd like to know what the price is, but I'm down.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.400
And that would be for a game pass.

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.520
Ultimate also, I think.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:12.480
Yeah.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.240
I mean, I don't know if I would have a lot of use for this because it's really just me

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.320
and Alan and I aren't going to share anything like that.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.640
So, but it's, uh, you know, it's again, just Microsoft trying to get even more people on

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:28.080
this, um, especially in the face of Sony now trying to launch their own product.

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.920
Although, and I can't believe we didn't mention this earlier, but there were a lot of things

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.520
to get into with that topic.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.000
One thing Sony is, is missing from their product is day one releases.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.840
And we all know the executives at Sony do not agree that those should be a part of a

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.040
subscription service.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.120
They also want to charge $70 for them.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:48.320
I think that decision is going to bite them a little bit, but it is what it is.

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.120
So, um, all right.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.320
Anyway, before I get into the next story, I do want to acknowledge this quest buster

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.240
and chat says I missed the Konami that gave us things, things like sweet code and two.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.920
I miss them too.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.960
I hope we have all acknowledged and made peace with the fact that that Konami is dead and

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.120
gone, literally gone.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.720
Those buildings closed.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:09.920
They're gone.

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.360
So we all, that Konami is never coming back.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.360
Those people gone to new jobs.

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.200
So I just, just as long as we all made peace with that.

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.120
And also the go back to like, when we're talking about, you know, with the differences between

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:30.880
game pass and Sony's PlayStation plus stuff, you know, when they make a game backwards

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.080
compatible on the Microsoft side, that's a backwards compatible game.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.000
If you own it digitally, it's in your library.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.640
If you own it physically, you can play it on the disc.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:46.640
Sony, you can play what we give you, or you can buy it.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.880
That's messed up.

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:49.380
I agree.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.800
Important note on the sweet code and thing though, which, which is a part of it.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:00.720
Like there isn't like, because what they released sweet code and one and two on the

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.840
PlayStation three.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.880
So if you had the original discs, they were collector's items, and then more people got

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:10.080
to experience with the PlayStation three, but you can't play those games right now on

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.520
a PS four PS five.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.840
I would imagine those games are going to be a part of the library.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:19.440
I don't know anything yet, but I just said Konami is going to whore their stuff out on

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.880
the corner for tricks.

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:24.320
I don't see why sweet code and won't be there, which will be great news.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.400
And Sony knows that's one that's going to get people to pay for the library.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:32.880
But I did want to read this comment from sacred Jade, because I absolutely agree with it.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.760
A sweet code and compilation would be chef's kiss.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.000
Yes, that's the compilation Konami needs to make.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:38.960
Get on it.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:39.520
But they won't.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:41.860
Anyway.

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.720
Bobby Blackwell says Nintendo was the same with virtual console, and we all wish they

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:51.520
brought back virtual console and got rid of NSOs.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.600
I think the problem there.

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:59.840
It's not the system of delivery, but it's the fact that there are these gaps in NSO

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.560
that virtual console is only highlighting.

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:09.840
There are games that came out on virtual console that just Nintendo switch online doesn't see,

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:14.160
you know, and they've they've been making progress to close the gap, like with the mother

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.360
one and two releases.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:21.200
But I feel like that's that's a big part of the problem is that we know Nintendo has released

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.040
stuff on those platforms that they can't get the third party rights to anymore.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.480
Like, I don't understand why they don't like they could literally do both.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:36.240
They could sell them virtual console and like, you could make your money back.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.040
Like, what's a subscription to Game Pass Ultimate?

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:39.920
Like, 25 bucks?

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.600
Like, or not Game Pass Ultimate.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.600
It was whatever.

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.920
Nintendo's online expansion pass or whatever.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:53.200
Expand $25 on top of was a total like 40 bucks, whatever a year.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:58.560
Like, there are people that will buy at least five games and you're probably charging like

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:04.400
at least $8 for those games, you would make probably more money than that because they

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:05.920
want specific titles.

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.320
They could also look at, hey, I don't want to buy these all individually.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.800
I want to just, you know, buy this pass.

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:15.520
And that might make it more attractive one way or the other.

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:18.960
Because if you're selling games individually, you can go look at how much value you're

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.320
getting out of this, you know, subscription service instead.

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:29.360
And it's when when you give player choice and you also make your package look more attractive.

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.440
Like I don't understand why they don't do it.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:37.200
Licensing maybe because you're licensing the rights for a subscription service versus individual

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.040
sales, but I think that can be tweaked pretty easy.

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:40.560
I don't know.

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.720
I just think I think we all know licensing is what's holding back Super Mario RPG.

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:51.040
But the thing there is, I don't see why Nintendo and Square Enix can't sit down at the table

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.520
and figure that out to get that game to come out.

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:59.840
But maybe Square Enix wants to make it a standalone release so they can get more money off of

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.840
it than just including it in the NSL library.

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.920
I think that's what it boils down to that.

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:07.360
Make a remaster or something like that and just put it out in a remaster.

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.000
I don't know.

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:12.880
Also, the chat is pointing out because I did bring up Sue Coden.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:15.760
They did bring up Aiden Chronicles, which is still coming out.

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.680
Yeah, I actually kickstarted that one.

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:19.680
And I'm in the Discord server.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.720
I don't follow it a lot, but they're still on track to get that out too.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:27.280
So Aiden Chronicles will be the spiritual successor to Sue Coden in a lot of ways.

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.640
And that'll be really exciting.

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.000
So all right, I want to get to one more story here before we get to the classic game of

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.920
the week, although there's a little bit of a twist.

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:37.040
I'll tell you about that in a moment.

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:43.600
And that is about the game Loop Hero, which has been covered a lot lately.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:51.440
It's kind of an interesting little RPG that has a retro PC look to it, but it's actually

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.520
made by a Russian developer.

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:57.360
And at this point, with everything going on in the world, that Russian developer has said,

01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.680
just pirate it.

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:06.960
This was from a post on the social media platform VK, which I think is pretty big in Russia.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.240
It's VK.com.

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:13.280
I haven't used it myself, but I always thought LiveJournal was the big thing in Russia because

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:18.480
I know it took over, but that is another big social platform in Russia.

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:26.000
The developer of the game Four Quarters was addressing Russian fans who can't access Steam

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.640
or Nintendo Switch because of all the sanctions going on.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.440
Nobody can buy the game because all the companies are sanctioning because of what's going on

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.000
in Ukraine.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:40.160
And so Steam and Nintendo don't accept payments and basically nobody can get Loop Hero.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:47.200
So the developers are like, torrent it, here is a link to RU Tracker, an official Russian

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:52.080
torrent site, basically saying it is not known when all this will end.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:57.360
Therefore, in such difficult times, we can only help everyone to raise the pirate flag

01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:02.960
together with VPN and share the most popular distribution on the RU Tracker.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:09.520
That is a translated by Google Translate of one of the tweets, if you will, on that platform.

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.680
Fans of Loop Hero are asking, is there ways we can directly support or compensate the

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.240
developers?

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:21.920
And due to the state-owned bank sanctions in Russia, the game developers can't cash

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.040
out their earnings.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:27.920
So Four Quarters said, we are very grateful for your support, but the truth is that everything

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:28.720
is fine with us.

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:32.400
Send this support to your families and friends at this difficult time.

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:39.120
So as much as you know, and when we've talked about what's going on with Ukraine and everything,

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:45.200
that's why I'm very clear to point out this is Vladimir Putin's disgusting actions and

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:47.440
war that's going on that he started.

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:51.200
There's a lot of awesome people in Russia that want nothing to do with it.

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.720
And it sounds like the makers of this game are a part of that bunch.

01:32:54.720 --> 01:33:01.280
I mean, that is a very big thing to basically walk away from the potential earnings of your

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:07.280
game because of bigger things that are going on in the world, you know, and just say at

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.880
this point, fuck it, pirate it.

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.880
So props to the folks behind Loop Hero for that.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:21.760
So there's a lot of good people who are suffering over this horrible persons.

01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:29.440
The only thing I can call it is toxicity on a major level because it's the type that it's

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:39.440
like it's like a humanitarian Chernobyl, if that makes sense, that so many people are

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.680
hurt had nothing to do with causing the incident.

01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:52.480
No one had anything to do with with creating it, but it's spreading, it's destroying lives

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:55.120
and it's going to continue to hurt people for years after.

01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:55.620
Yeah.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:57.360
All right.

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.360
Well, I don't have a clean way to make a transition here, but I am just going to find

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:01.680
stuff.

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:01.920
Yeah.

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:04.000
We're just going to introduce our next segment here.

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.520
Let me roll.

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.480
Actually, thankfully, I have this little bumper that introduces it for me.

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:09.200
So let's go to it.

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:25.280
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.520
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.160
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:39.040
But in a 2022 twist, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a handheld electronic

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:43.120
handheld to spotlight as the classic handheld of the month.

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:47.680
So Dark Soccer, what do you what you picked a pretty obscure one this week?

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:48.720
So why don't you tell us about it?

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:51.040
It's one of my favorites, which is why I picked it.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.000
So I picked the Puyo Lin of which I have blessed little information on that I could find, but

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.080
I still wanted to to highlight it.

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:07.920
And actually, I made a little teensy video to go with it, since there's literally no

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.640
footage anywhere of someone playing one.

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.720
Um, is this your is this your own music bed in it?

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.800
No, this is actually from Puyo Puyo on Genesis.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:19.680
Okay, that works.

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:21.140
Yeah.

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:27.920
Um, so anyway, as you can see in here, the Puyo Lin, first of all, it coming out was

01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:35.120
a surprise, because not many people in America knew what Puyo Puyo was.

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.080
It had never there'd never been a game in the US.

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.880
Closest thing that we had was like Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:49.520
So when this came out by Tiger in the US, it was really a surprise.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:56.960
Um, it's a little, you know, LCD keychain thing.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.680
It was about, yay, big.

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.000
I can't find mine.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.560
I'm ever regretful of this and I want another.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.920
My birthday's coming up, y'all.

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:16.320
Anyway, um, it was released in 1997, licensed by Compile made by Tiger Electronics.

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:22.880
It came out in, of course, in Japan first, along with, uh, there was a Tempest, there

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.520
was a Pong, there were a few others in the series.

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:29.600
Um, and in Japan, it was called Puyori.

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:35.280
So as you, if anyone can read the Kana on it, it clearly says that.

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:40.320
Um, so they kept the same name here in the US and it was basically just little single

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.160
player Puyo Puyo game.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:50.080
Um, what I thought was cool is that, uh, in fact, you can even see it right around here.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.360
It's got like the little, uh, Puyo button.

01:36:54.480 --> 01:37:02.400
Um, the, uh, but the American one basically looked exactly the same, um, just in English.

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:07.520
And it was, it was really a lot of fun.

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:15.600
I, I played the crap out of one of these at my first job here, which was working at a

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:19.040
GNC, which was also my last part-time gig.

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:23.920
And, um, and yeah, I know they're on Amazon for 30 bucks, but I'm going to Disneyland,

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.280
so I can't pay the money right now.

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:32.320
Um, but at any rate, it's a fun little game, you know, it's just, you know, blip blip,

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.880
you know, but I kept it on my key chain.

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:42.640
I, I, mine was all scuffed up and terrible by the time I was done with it, but it was

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.840
a fun, fun little, little, little toy.

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:48.960
And for me at the time I was just excited.

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:51.280
Dan found it for me at like a Walmart.

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:56.240
Um, but, uh, and it was, I think like 10 bucks.

01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.720
Yeah, something like that.

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.120
Um, but anyway, that's it.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:04.560
I think I'd like to try one sometime.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:10.080
That's interesting how it kind of came out here before the games had really caught on

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.680
here at all, you know, before Puyo Puyo was the thing here.

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:14.800
I think that's interesting.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.520
So, I mean, yeah, it was a big surprise.

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.000
And now for, for me, I mean, Dan and I had been importing games forever and I had copies

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:22.640
of Puyo Puyo.

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:28.880
And so when, when Dan found that and gave it to me, I mean, we were newly together at

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.120
this time too, but I was delighted.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.200
And yeah, they're, they're just really cute, fun, little, little LCD things.

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.640
Good way to waste some time.

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.000
I mean, we had the Mean Bean Machine and, um, um, Kirby's Avalanche at this point.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.200
That's what I said right at the beginning.

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:45.760
Yeah.

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.440
But, um, yeah, a lot of people didn't associate that with Puyo Puyo, of course.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.880
So, yeah.

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.320
Well, because like I also said, nobody here had seen Puyo Puyo except those other two

01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.400
iterations of it.

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.080
So, all right.

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:04.160
Well, there it is your classic handheld of the month.

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:06.400
And let's hear it for five minutes of video editing.

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:06.720
All right.

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:09.600
All right.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.840
Hey, I did that Ken Burns effect by hand.

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:12.320
Okay.

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:12.640
All right.

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:21.680
Let us travel around the industry rapidly in some rapid fire news and we'll go to Loki.

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:23.520
All right.

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.480
So certain things off, um, it's funny.

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:30.480
I actually played this game a while back.

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:37.200
The original, uh, you may, this is a long forgotten platformer game that was put out

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:38.960
gax.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:45.120
He was a quick witted gecko who used to have a bunch of different, like, uh,

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:50.640
pop culture, um, one liners and whatnot.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.800
So there was supposed to be a spinoff for the series called Gex Jr.

01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:00.240
And apparently a prototype demo was made for that back in 2001.

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:05.920
And now that has leaked out because obviously it never became a thing, but that's pretty

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.320
awesome that you can actually, uh, check it out.

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:15.120
Um, I probably will not be checking it out because I've unfortunately don't love gex

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:16.480
as much as I used to anymore.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.240
That's just the thing.

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:28.000
Um, and then of course, uh, to try to get you excited about the, uh, was it paramount

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.960
plus they're going to be releasing the first episode of halo, uh, free to watch on YouTube

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:35.760
for one week.

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.800
And you can decide whether you want to subscribe to the series.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.200
I hear that the series falls really after the first episode.

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.720
So that's what I hear too.

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.800
I guess the they'll, they'll trick you.

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:54.160
They come in and, you know, come in there and watch it and disappoint you with episode

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.800
two, but you can check out the first episode that first week is already in progress.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.480
March 31st was the first day.

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:03.760
So you got to get on that quick if you want to watch it.

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:09.120
So, um, Bobby Blackwell, Bobby Blackwell in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.960
says they did this with Picard too.

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:14.080
The first episode is, was on YouTube or is on YouTube.

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:20.080
I believe they did that with, um, drag race all star six too, which was also a paramount

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.040
plus exclusive.

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.440
So they're doing that with a lot of the paramount plus shows.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.480
I am just not interested in paramount plus at all.

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:31.040
I, I actually will say it's one of the better subscription services.

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.800
Um, but I'm also a Trekkie.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:37.200
So, but, uh, what they've been doing in Picard.

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:39.280
Cause I hear that show is not great.

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.800
I'm not up to current on that as much as I just said.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.240
I can't completely the opposite.

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:44.960
Yeah.

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:48.640
I I'm not up to speed on season two yet, so I can't tell you.

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:49.920
So, um, yeah.

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:54.160
And as far as a lot of the reality garbage, well, the one thing that did piss me off about

01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:00.240
paramount plus was that they pulled the international versions of survivor, which yeah, the, the

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:02.960
Australian version of survivor is so fucking good.

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.280
Like I think Jeff probes just didn't want the competition.

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.200
So anyway, all right.

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.560
Uh, dark soccer, what do you have?

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:15.760
Uh, the Nintendo direct came with a very sad announcement.

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:20.720
Well, you can take it both ways, but breath of the wild two has been delayed to spring

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:22.000
2023.

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:26.480
They did release though, another trailer that people are already picking apart.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.480
Um, like, did you see the state of the master sword?

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.720
It looked like it had been eaten by acid.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:33.760
It was pretty crazy.

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:40.720
But anyway, I'll Numa, um, issued an apology and, uh, the, I would rather it be delayed

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.480
and be good then come out on time and be terrible.

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:53.600
So anyway, um, moving on, uh, there is a, uh, switch online.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.320
NES SNES collections are been updated.

01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:02.000
Earthworm Jim to dig dug two and Mappy land are on the list.

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:07.440
Um, I, I freaking love all things Mappy.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.680
Mappy land is a weird little game though.

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:13.760
Um, but it, it's fun to have a few more on there.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.760
Although dig dug two is not super great.

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:19.040
Mappy lands kind of, it's, it's not map.

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.320
I mean, it's Mappy, but it's not.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.000
It's not, it's, it's Mappy world.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.920
Well, I mean, there was also, that was around the same era.

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:25.360
They were doing things like pack land.

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:25.760
Yeah.

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:26.080
Yeah.

01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:26.880
And all of that.

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.600
So, um, Japan got something kind of cool too.

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.040
I forgot what it was in the moment.

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.720
Um, dark to see, what was it?

01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.600
Japan got, cause they got something kind of interesting

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.880
instead of earthworm Jim too.

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.840
Um, they got a different title.

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.360
Uh, dig dug two is weird.

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:48.000
It's one of those games where it's just like the sequel has

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.280
nothing to do with the original.

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.920
And that's what is kind of weird about it.

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:55.360
Um, well, I'll, I'll be perfectly honest.

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.000
You know, I've got that little arcade one up.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.560
That's got a dig dug and dug dug two on it.

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:05.360
And I'm actually trying to, I'm considering rehoming it.

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.480
You said it's an arcade one up.

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.920
Well, it's, it's not an arcade.

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:13.520
I don't think it's an arcade one up.

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.480
It's one of those little mini desktop.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.840
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:18.800
What else is on it?

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.080
Is it just those two?

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.200
Dig dug and dig dug two.

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:22.320
Oh, I thought it was.

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.400
But we got the, the one that's got the bunch more machine,

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.520
the much more games on it.

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:28.640
Dan found one.

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.800
And then we also have the one with Galaga and Galaga 98 on it.

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.560
I may or may not be interested in that actually.

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.400
Cause I love to talk the original.

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:42.880
Yeah, we should talk, but, but I'm also just looking at getting an Amco machine.

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.560
So that has everything in it.

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:45.620
All right.

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:51.120
Um, Harvest Moon is the game that Japan got instead of Earthworm Jim too.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.160
I looked at that one.

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.120
Oh, they got the better deal.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.960
I, I, I don't, well then again, I'm not the biggest fan of Earthworm Jim.

01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:59.440
So, but it's, it is very America.

01:44:59.440 --> 01:44:59.940
Yeah.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:00.720
All right.

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:01.600
Yeah.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.080
A game that burps the title and the introduction is very American, I guess.

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:07.360
All right.

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.800
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some new games

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:14.000
coming to a store shelf or a digital storefront near you.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:14.500
Loki.

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:15.680

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:44.400
Happy's humble burger farm on Nintendo switch.

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.000
That's a horror game by the way.

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:51.040
The house of the dead remake on Nintendo switch and that's it.

01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:53.620
All right.

01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:58.320
Let's go to Japan and check out the releases over there.

01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:03.120
Um, I think we want to be looking at releases on April the seventh, um, which

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:08.000
would include on Nintendo switch behind the screen and defoliation, uh, comes out

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.840
in a regular and a special edition.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:14.320
And we also have metal dogs in a regular and bow.

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:14.720
Wow.

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:15.280
Wonderful.

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:18.160
Addition is coming out.

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:22.480
By the way, this is one of those like Nintendog type of games.

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.080
I don't know why they're metal dogs, but I get, Oh, now I'm looking at

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:30.320
screenshots and literally this game looks like Nintendogs meets Contra.

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:32.320
What the fuck?

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.360
This game looks rad.

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:35.600
What?

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:35.920
What?

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:36.880
This looks cool.

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:37.600
Hold on, hold on.

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:38.240
I need this in my life.

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:39.040
Stop the presses.

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.320
Stop the presses.

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.680
Is this our new president cat?

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:45.760
I was like, I think we have another one of those games where I need to know,

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:48.080
like, why doesn't this shit come out here?

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.720
Unless I just did check the chat.

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:51.680
I just linked it.

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:56.640
Um, for our live listeners over at Twitch, uh, I need this.

01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.240
What is, this is awesome.

01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:01.920
Looking set in a world after the destruction of humankind, the harsh

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.080
PlayStation two game.

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:04.720
Is it really?

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:05.280
It is.

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.240
I don't know this game.

01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:06.800
Super old.

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.000
So they've just ported it on the switch because why not?

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.680
I'm going to look it up middle.

01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:15.760
That's cool.

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:16.560
I want that game.

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:16.880
All right.

01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:17.360
Anyway.

01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:17.520
Yeah.

01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:19.200
They have giant like, uh, guns on the back.

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:19.840
It's on steam.

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.120
Is it really?

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:22.000
Yeah.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:22.880
It's on steam.

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:23.760
Well, stop.

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:24.320
Oh my God.

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.040
It's adorable.

01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:30.000
How did I not know about this steam link in chat?

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.880
I guess, I guess some things slip under my nose.

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:36.160
Sometimes there's just, I've posted stuff like this on Twitter before.

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.320
Loki, everybody.

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:47.120
There are too many games, too many games, too many games, too many.

01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:48.160
There are too many games.

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:49.760
I can't play and remember them all.

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:55.680
And it's one of the, and I think in the case of this game, you could probably go back to

01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:02.080
an old episode of OLR circa 2006, where I got excited about this game before, but it's

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:02.960
been that long.

01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:05.520
And I'm that old where you could show it to me again.

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.640
And I'm like, Oh, this is new.

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.800
If you want something to be excited about on the switch, there was a video I saw recently

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:18.640
by John Riggs who played a game called super cyborg, which looks exactly like Contra.

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:21.280
So you should check that out.

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:21.780
Okay.

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.960
I would be interested in a new Contra game because Konami can't.

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:27.460
All right.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.360
Moving over to Japan's PlayStation five releases.

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:34.000
We have Lego star Wars is out there as well.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.760
MLB the show 22 is also out in Japan this week.

01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.720
And that's about it.

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:45.120
And I would read Xbox releases in Japan, but using Xbox in Japan in the same sentence doesn't

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:45.680
work.

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:48.080
So we will go to the UK dark Sakura.

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.000
How dare this only be on windows?

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.180
Biased.

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:53.380
Anyway.

01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:59.760
On the fifth for the big three, we have Lego star Wars, the Skywalker saga.

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:06.000
We also have crisis remastered trilogy for the switch on the seventh for the PlayStation.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.160
We have road maintenance simulator.

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:09.760
They're really getting into those Sims, aren't they?

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:15.920
On the eighth, we have the a 500 mini which I believe was on a mega computer.

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:21.600
Um, we also have doki doki literature club plus for PlayStation.

01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:25.040
Also Lake for PlayStation for PlayStation switch.

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:30.880
We have skull, the hero Slayer on the eighth, also for switch legend of mana, final fantasy

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:34.720
nine world of final fantasy Nickelodeon cart racers.

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.120
And the C Finney.

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:38.960
All right.

01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:41.440
We have a few more news stories for you all.

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:45.360
And then we'll get to the listener round table where you can call and chat with us on our

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:50.560
discord server, or you can send us emails to participate at orange laundry.com.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:53.920
Or you can ask us questions in chat about whatever you like.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:56.640
But before we get there, we have some more stories.

01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:57.840
So we're going to start with Loki.

01:49:58.960 --> 01:49:59.520
Yes.

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:06.000
So this is a story about how Epic is being sued because Fortnite stole someone else's

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:06.720
dance.

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:10.000
You may remember that we've kind of gone through this before.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:18.000
And I believe that the court system said that they couldn't award damages to the choreographer

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.880
before because those dance numbers or routines were not copyrighted.

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:30.320
But that brings us to today, where we have now a lawyer representing the choreographer

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:37.120
Kyle Hana Gami, he sued epic for copyright infringement for his it's complicated of the

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.320
dance emote in Fortnite.

01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:44.080
But he does actually have the copyright for his choreography.

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.400
So that's a different story.

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:48.640
Oh, I guess.

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:52.640
Guess Epic Games is going to have to get rid of it or settle.

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:58.320
But epic, but Epic Games is a poor little indie company with no money, whatever they're

01:50:58.320 --> 01:50:59.280
going to do.

01:50:59.280 --> 01:50:59.780
Yeah.

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.480
So they did not credit him nor consent to use display, reproduce, sell or create derivatives

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:09.280
based off of his registered choreography.

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:15.360
It is it is a bummer in a way because meme dances are a lot of fun to see show up in

01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:19.600
games like remember World of Warcraft back when it was cool or profiting off of this

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:20.320
stuff, though?

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:24.320
Yeah, no, I get Yeah, when you're selling well is does Fortnite sell that as a micro

01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:24.880
transaction?

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:26.560
I imagine they do believe that they do.

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:29.200
Yeah, then that's that's where it gets dicey.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:33.760
And where Yeah, the director or the choreographer, excuse me, probably deserves their fair share

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:34.260
of the money.

01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:37.620
Yeah, interesting thing about Fortnite.

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:43.700
Um, I did not realize that they the building, I knew they were taking it out for the season,

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:47.780
but I guess there's now like a no build mode in the game permanently.

01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:53.940
Like where you can play Fortnite without the building element and never before have I wanted

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:58.820
to actually try Fortnite again more because the building was the thing I never understood.

01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:01.940
You take the only distinct thing out of Fortnite.

01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:02.440
Cool.

01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:03.940
Generic shooters.

01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:04.520
Yay.

01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:07.380
I have no interest in playing Fortnite.

01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:10.820
Generic shooter with Ariana Grande.

01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:12.420
Just saying.

01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:14.580
She's important.

01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:15.720
All right.

01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:17.460
Moving on.

01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:21.300
Actually, Ariana Grande does usually have a presence on my stream.

01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:25.140
I will admit a little less conversation.

01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:25.860
As she should.

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:26.920
All right.

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:28.980
Moving on Dark Sakura.

01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:37.860
Um, so the, uh, the developer of Abandoned claims, uh, they reached out to Silent Hill's,

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:50.500
uh, uh, the publisher Konami, evil, evil, evil, evil, um, to try to, um, to, uh, get

01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:51.940
the license for Silent Hill.

01:52:52.180 --> 01:53:02.980
Um, uh, they, uh, uh, Hassan Karaman, uh, reached out and the quote is I reached out to them.

01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:07.620
I was stressed out because people thought it was Silent Hill about, about his game.

01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:10.580
Um, it got so out of hand, you know, you're the small developer.

01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:11.780
You've never had a big audience.

01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:12.980
You're inexperienced.

01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:16.100
I reached out to Konami saying, Hey, you know what?

01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:17.460
It was never my intention.

01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:18.420
And they were really cool.

01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:19.640
Hmm.

01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:28.580
Um, so, but yeah, there's people out there thinking that his game is a Silent Hill game.

01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:32.500
Uh, and I'm like, why do you think that?

01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:33.940
Can you not read the title?

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:38.020
Can you not read that Kojima had nothing to do with this internet gonna internet.

01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:40.420
So dumb.

01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:42.020
I mean, I don't want to use that word.

01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:43.300
That's so pointless.

01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:43.800
Yeah.

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:52.760
But anyway, um, and also, uh, there are rumors that abandoned would be canceled and the rumors

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:53.260
are false.

01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.400
Well, it sounds like it's a pretty kick butt game.

01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:01.800
It's it sounds like that, you know, if people keep comparing it and wanting it to be a Silent

01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:04.520
Hill game so badly, let's be real.

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:09.560
That, um, hollow husk of a once great company is never going to put out a Silent Hill game

01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:11.240
that's worthy of our time.

01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:17.160
So, you know, why not play that spiritual successor, even if it's not actually a successor?

01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:17.560
I don't know.

01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:18.760
Could have had one.

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.160
I know.

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:19.800
But no.

01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:25.080
I know, but no cannot is this the first in many bad decisions by Konami, but you know

01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:28.520
what we've talked about that literally a million times.

01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:30.040
So let's go on to our next story.

01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:31.420
Loki.

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:33.100
Yes.

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:37.880
So this is exciting because I completely forgot about it, but apparently the Stanley parable,

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:41.960
ultra deluxe is going to be coming out April 27th.

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:49.320
So that is very soon and you'll be able to play that on the switch PlayStation for PlayStation

01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:53.640
five, Xbox one, Xbox series, and I'm assuming PC.

01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.080
So, well, I would hope because that's, I can't wait for most people play the game originally,

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:00.040
but, uh, yeah.

01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:02.520
How many years from the original is this finally coming out?

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:03.240
That's pretty cool.

01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.640
It's been a while, a long time, long time.

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:09.640
So I almost feel like the original can be a classic game of the week pretty soon.

01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:11.320
So, all right.

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:11.880
Probably.

01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:12.380
Yeah.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:13.880
All right.

01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:18.840
Well, speaking of classic games, that takes me to our last official headline of tonight

01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:24.280
and the potential of a Capcom arcade second stadium being released.

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:29.480
Apparently the game rating and administration committee of Korea has rated Capcom arcade

01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:31.000
second stadium for PC.

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:36.440
Um, the, the ratings board in Korea has kind of leaked games before.

01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:40.840
So this is definitely one of those, Oh, there might be smoke and fire type of thing here.

01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:46.520
Uh, this would be a followup to the Capcom arcade stadium collection that was released

01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:48.360
in February, 2021.

01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:55.480
Um, what's interesting about that though, is that I thought the first stadium was built

01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:56.920
to be aware.

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:59.640
I mean, you, you get download packs for the first one.

01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:05.560
Like I thought the first one was supposed to be editable enough so that they could add

01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:06.280
stuff to it.

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:09.560
I don't see why they need to release a second stadium.

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:10.680
That seems weird.

01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:14.840
And I don't even know if I can blame a money thing because I I'm pretty sure Capcom arcade

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.280
stadium is free and you get like one game with it.

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.040
But then of course, you know, in the great tradition and other games do this too, like

01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:26.120
the pinball effects type of things you have to pay for all the extra machines.

01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:28.840
So it's, it's not even really a money thing.

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:33.640
It's just weird that it's not all just going into Capcom arcade stadium.

01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:36.600
I don't know why they need to have two different stadiums.

01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:37.240
So weird.

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.800
And dark Tetsuya in our chat seems to agree with that line of thinking saying, sounds

01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.480
like it might be a whole new thing.

01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:43.960
I agree.

01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:46.120
I thought for sure they would just expand the first one.

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:47.880
Yeah, that part doesn't make sense.

01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:55.080
So we'll see what has apparently also been rated is Capcom arcade second stadium bundle

01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:55.880
one.

01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:58.840
So that also implies that it will be in packs.

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:03.960
There was a lot missing from the first arcade stadium because Capcom's made a lot of arcade

01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:04.460
games.

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:06.840
But there was a lot of good stuff in that first one too.

01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:11.320
Like I know Dark Sakura is very, very partial to Strider, the original arcade game, and

01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:12.040
that is in there.

01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:15.960
You know, one of the Street Fighter games, not all of them, but one of the, you know,

01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:18.600
or maybe two, I can't remember, but that's in there.

01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:20.440
But there are, it's certainly missing a lot of stuff.

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:21.960
So it'd be, it'd be interesting to see.

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:24.600
I wonder if they'll put in it.

01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:29.560
Some of the games they've released before, like magic sword, they put out magic sword

01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:32.840
and final fight in a compilation on Xbox 360.

01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:38.920
And I think PS3 in that era, I'd be very curious if maybe they just release it again in this

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:39.480
compilation.

01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:41.240
I wonder if it's not some of those games.

01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:46.280
So, uh, dark to see it says if they put black tiger in it, I'm more than happy to pick it

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:46.680
up.

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:47.180
Yeah.

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:49.340
So, all right.

01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:54.460
Anyhow, that is everything we officially had on the agenda for tonight, but it's time for

01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:56.060
the listener round table and your thoughts.

01:57:56.780 --> 01:58:01.900
If you have any emails, you can send them to participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:05.340
I don't think we had any tonight, but let me check with dark Sakura on that.

01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:07.020
I could have got that wrong.

01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:08.380
Nada.

01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:09.340
She's shaking her head.

01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:09.660
All right.

01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:13.740
Usually I would fill this time with drag race chatter while we don't get emails.

01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:16.220
But to be fair, I did already talk about that earlier in the evening.

01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:18.140
So I'm not going to put y'all through it again.

01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:20.140
Yes, you did.

01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:25.900
So, um, if you guys have any questions in chat, you can go ahead and ask those over

01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:30.460
twitch.tv slash vog network or any topics maybe we didn't cover that you're curious

01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:31.580
about our take on.

01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:37.980
And, uh, of course, uh, if you want to give us a call vog network.com, VOG network.com

01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:41.180
slash discord and the green room is the place to go.

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:43.980
And, uh, we'll, we'll bring some callers on the show that way.

01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:45.980
Um, throughout the cool kids.

01:58:45.980 --> 01:58:46.780
All right.

01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:47.020
Yeah.

01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:52.220
So let me check, uh, and see maybe if there's any last minute stories that Loki has that

01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:53.500
maybe we want to get into first.

01:58:54.540 --> 01:59:00.380
Uh, Sony has laid off 90 employees because as part of their, uh, sales and marketing

01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:06.060
staff or merchandising staff, and they're focusing more, they were apparently, um, they're

01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:08.060
focusing more direct to consumer.

01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:09.660
And so they don't really need those folks.

01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:14.140
Well, if you're selling digital PS fives, that's the only way to go, right?

01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:15.660
I guess, yeah.

01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:18.380
So that's unfortunate.

01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:22.860
I did like that with, uh, the free games with prime that we get with, uh, Twitch and stuff

01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:25.660
like that, that one of the games is called Turner boy commits tax evasion.

01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:27.100
I have that game.

01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:29.020
It's how appropriate for this season.

01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:30.460
I didn't even know that was pretty funny.

01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:30.940
That's great.

01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:32.300
I didn't know that was the thing.

01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:36.140
I'll have to check that out and monkey Island two special edition and oblivion.

01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:38.700
There are so many free games.

01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:41.020
I forget to grab like all the time.

01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:43.340
So, especially on Twitch, Twitch has a ton of them.

01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:43.900
I can't forget.

01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.580
Does Twitch still run their own client?

01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:46.540
I'm pretty sure they do.

01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:48.780
Like they have their own front end store.

01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:51.260
Um, some are part of that.

01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:57.020
Some are like, I know in this one, uh, elder scrolls four is part of good old games, plants

01:59:57.020 --> 01:59:59.420
versus zombies is, uh, origin.

02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:03.260
So there's, it's kind of a mixed bag.

02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:04.380
Oh, did your MSS?

02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:05.900
The Twitch app is being shut down.

02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:06.700
Oh, I didn't know that.

02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:10.620
I mean, it's not my games going hugely surprising.

02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:13.820
That's probably like through Amazon gaming or something like that through your digital

02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:14.700
library through them.

02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:16.320
Probably.

02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:21.740
Oh, you know, I, you know what I would do if I was a Amazon, I'd push it all through

02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:22.140
Luna.

02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:23.980
That's what I do.

02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:24.140
Yeah.

02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:25.740
Maybe that's what they're aiming to do.

02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:26.220
Yeah.

02:00:26.220 --> 02:00:32.060
I would be shocked if that isn't, if they're really running that siloed over there, then

02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:35.820
I don't understand Amazon strategy because the smart thing to do would be to push it

02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:39.820
all into Luna and have people install a Luna client on their desktop.

02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:43.820
And then they can stream these games over here, but these ones in their library, they

02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:45.660
can, you know, run for free or whatever.

02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:47.340
So interesting.

02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:47.660
All right.

02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:48.220
So yeah.

02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:50.380
Rama says the desktop app is shutting down.

02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:53.420
I guess I'm not totally surprised, but maybe a little surprised.

02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:57.500
Uh, any other last minute stories, Loki?

02:00:58.780 --> 02:00:59.740
Uh, nope.

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:00.780
No.

02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:02.460
No.

02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:03.020
Sorry.

02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:03.580
Well, let me see.

02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:04.540
What else can I talk about?

02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:06.460
I was trying to see if there's anything for my trip.

02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:09.500
I didn't get into, um, I lost a lot of money.

02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:15.100
So the, the little parody intro tonight was not a joke.

02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:15.900
I lost a lot.

02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:19.500
Well, not look, I set a budget and I stick to the budget.

02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:24.300
So I know, like, I know I'm walking into this and I'm going to lose this money.

02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:27.900
So yeah, except the one time I won a bunch of money, then I didn't lose it.

02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:30.380
But, um, that doesn't, doesn't happen all the time.

02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:35.820
Uh, tiger claw, bring in the receipts on the Twitch desktop app saying it's true.

02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:38.780
The Twitch desktop app will be shut down on April 30th.

02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:42.860
We've made the difficult decision to say goodbye to the Twitch desktop app on April 30th.

02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:46.940
This decision was not made lightly and came from a combination of usage and user feedback.

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:51.900
This move allows us to invest more heavily in enhancing and adding new ways to engage

02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:53.820
with the creators and communities you care about.

02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:54.880
Hmm.

02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:58.620
If you're used to using the Twitch desktop app,

02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:02.940
we recommend bookmarking Twitch TV in your browser of choice for easy access.

02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:09.740
But what, what happens to the library of games?

02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:11.740
I have like a shit ton of Neo Geo games.

02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:14.780
They gave away like 30 Neo Geo games once on there.

02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:16.940
I'm a shit ton.

02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:20.220
And I think that they're like, you can redeem like whenever, so.

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:20.720
Yeah.

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:23.360
So I'm curious where those end up going.

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:24.000
So we'll see.

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:26.260
All right.

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:32.240
Well, I guess if there's no other comments and no other thoughts, we will move to wrap

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:35.200
up tonight's show around the two hour mark, but that's all right.

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:40.080
Um, I guess it was a lighter week with, uh, me being out of town and April fool's day

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:42.320
kind of gets in the way of the real news for a day.

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:43.920
So it is what it is.

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:47.120
Um, but thank you of course, everybody for being here tonight.

02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:50.480
Uh, we always appreciate your support here at orange lounge radio.

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:54.080
Um, if you enjoyed the show, uh, help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:57.680
the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't

02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:00.480
here on air, we can't get them out there.

02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:07.040
Um, a nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, Google, wherever you found this show a nice

02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:09.760
five star review on the platform and social media shares.

02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:11.440
They go an awful long way.

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:13.680
So we really appreciate everyone that does that.

02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:16.320
Um, yeah, I don't, I don't know what else to say.

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.600
Thank you so much for being here.

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:19.360
We'll do it again next week.

02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:22.800
It's time to get everybody's final thoughts and dark Sakura.

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:25.280
I see you setting up ready to go with your post-show.

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:27.040
So what's your final thought tonight?

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:28.640
I need chocolate.

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:36.320
Also, also, also I am 56 followers away from 500 and I'm so excited.

02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:37.200
Oh, good luck with that.

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:38.640
I know you've been pushing to get that.

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:44.080
It's, it's tough because it's like, it's, it's hard to, you know, get people to like

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:48.000
follow me cause I'm close, you know, it's hard to do that, but you just have to kind

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.880
of keep the pedal to the metal and hope it sticks.

02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:52.080
So, yeah.

02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:57.280
And I mean, it's just a number really, but something like that for me, having been back

02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:00.960
into doing this for a year, it, it's definitely something that would mean a lot to me.

02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:07.280
Um, especially by my birthday, but I've, I'm, I'm putting a lot of work into this upcoming

02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:11.760
marathon and, you know, I, I mostly, it's not like I even care about the subs as much.

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:16.880
I just want to have my friends around for a virtual birthday party and just, you know,

02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:18.720
kill salty survivors.

02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:19.780
All right.

02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:21.040
Well, good luck.

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:21.520
Have fun.

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:26.080
And we'll see you killing salty survivors in a minute here after OLR live on Twitch.

02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:26.800
So have a good night.

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:28.160
Later tater.

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:28.480
All right.

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:29.680
We'll go to Loki.

02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:30.720
Your final thought tonight.

02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:36.480
So my final thought is in order to access your Twitch games that you have through prime

02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:38.880
gaming, you have to get the Amazon gaming app.

02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:39.920
Aha.

02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:40.160
Okay.

02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:41.360
So there is another app.

02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:41.840
Interesting.

02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:42.560
Yeah.

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:42.960
All right.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.680
Um, well, that's too bad.

02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:48.160
Um, let's see my final thought.

02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.440
I don't know if I have a lot.

02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:52.240
I didn't stream at all last week cause I was gone for half of it.

02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:56.240
So I hope to do some streaming this week of, um, I don't know what I'll play, but I'll

02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:58.480
find some, I'll find something.

02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:02.240
There's, there's always lots of games to catch up on many things I need to play.

02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:04.080
So I will try to get on that.

02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:06.720
Otherwise I was very thankful to have a break.

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:09.840
Uh, from, from, well, I mean, work is fine.

02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:14.400
I don't, but it's, even if you love your job, it's just nice to get a little break from

02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:18.800
that routine and just do something silly with my husband, which is exactly what we

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:19.920
did and just.

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:25.360
Go to, he had never been to Vegas before, so it was nice to take him to a new place

02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:26.560
and eat some good food.

02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:28.800
We got to Loki.

02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:33.440
We got to go to Benihana because they don't have one here and you know, my rule, I don't

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.880
go to, I don't go to restaurants.

02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:36.480
I can eat at home when I'm on vacation.

02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:39.120
However, I no longer can eat Benihana at home.

02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:39.760
So we had to go.

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:42.880
There's a teppanyaki place that's better than Benihana is in Roseville.

02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:44.560
Now it's over by the hobby lobby.

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:45.120
No, I didn't know.

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:45.760
You got to go there.

02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:46.820
Yeah.

02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:50.480
I know that that hobby lobby, I grew up in that area.

02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:54.320
I, and that used to be a Mervyn's back in the day.

02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:58.880
Cause my, and I know that place very well because every Sunday my mom went to Mervyn's

02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:01.040
and it was definitely the open, open, open thing.

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:07.920
Um, yeah, it's in Japan, something or other, but like we went there once and Oh, so good.

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:08.320
Okay.

02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:10.640
Like it is actually better than Benihana legit.

02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:13.520
Alan and I are going to try it cause we love those places.

02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:15.360
So yeah, it's really good.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:19.600
Like everything, just like all of the food was just so well seasoned.

02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:20.720
It was just so good.

02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:22.560
Um, yeah.

02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:25.120
And, uh, pot culture says he had never been to Vegas.

02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:25.600
Nope.

02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:31.840
Every time I had been previously, I went to like three final fantasy 14 conventions,

02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:32.960
but he didn't really play.

02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:33.520
He didn't care.

02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:37.200
That was something I kind of did either with Shane or other friends or whatever.

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:41.840
Uh, and then, um, I went there once with, uh, one of my gal pals, melody in the Bay

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:42.400
area.

02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:47.120
Um, and we went and saw Gwen Stefani and that was just something where it was a girls weekend.

02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:48.640
So, yeah.

02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:49.760
So anyway.

02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:50.400
All right.

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:55.360
Well, I hope you all have a fantastic week and eat some great food and we'll see you

02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:57.520
in seven days to do it all again.

02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:58.960
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

02:06:58.960 --> 02:06:59.200
Bye.
