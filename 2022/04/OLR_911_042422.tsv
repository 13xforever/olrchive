0	12960	This week, a bunch of Nintendo emulation rumors made the rounds.
12960	16440	This is your reminder that Nintendo has done emulation multiple times already and the slowness
16440	19760	of rolling out games is less technical, though programming is always some part of it but
19760	21200	more often licensing.
21200	24840	The Nintendo Switch Online SP games are a cute addition that is most thoroughly technical
24840	28200	and I appreciate Nintendo's effort to add a new twist into these games as well.
28200	29960	This is just one throwback content headline.
29960	32960	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about
32960	35880	this rumor and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now in the show where
35880	37960	every gamer has a voice.
37960	41720	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41720	45640	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45640	47920	Orange Lounge Radio.
47920	56200	We are live once again with episode number 911 of our show for tonight, April the 24th
56200	58960	of 2022.
58960	63920	And as I was as was pointed out to me on the Bobby Blackwell show before our show tonight,
63920	70200	apparently the 10 year anniversary of VOG Network which soft launched about what April
70200	73440	26th or so in 2012.
73440	74440	How about that?
74440	80040	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
80040	81400	Oh, hi.
81400	82400	Hi Dark Sakura.
82400	83400	How are you?
83400	84400	I'm all right.
84400	85400	How are you?
85400	86680	I'm doing well.
86680	89840	Let me just take a quick minute to point out not joining us tonight.
89840	94640	Unfortunately, Tech Master Loki, as mentioned on a previous episode of Orange Lounge Radio,
94640	97240	Loki had surgery earlier this week.
97240	101200	He's been giving updates through his Twitter account at Loki O-L-R.
101200	104560	And I am pleased to report he is out of surgery doing fine.
104560	107840	And I think in one of his tweets, he said it was getting better every hour.
107840	111460	So he's just he's just at that point where he's got to let the body heal.
111460	115740	So I would imagine instead of doing the show tonight, he's sleeping.
115740	119260	And quite frankly, what a great thing to be doing.
119260	124140	I think, you know, and Dark Sakura, myself perfectly healthy, but a nap sounds great,
124140	125260	to be honest.
125260	126260	So anyway,
126260	129300	Honestly, many naps sound great.
129300	136860	I we're going I start back in the office one day a week, starting tomorrow.
136860	143700	And the whole thought is just filling me with like bits and pieces of dread.
143700	151100	Because the moment if I if I get sick, I'm taking it to HR.
151100	155820	Is everybody going back the same day or are they staggering it?
155820	162100	I think you get to pick your one day a week out of like, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.
162100	165620	Okay, so there's a chance not everybody will be there the same day.
165620	169540	So it's a little bit Yeah, but still, now.
169540	176140	Now that you know, really, vaccinated or boosted status really isn't doing a whole lot to,
176140	179540	to starve off who gets sick, just the severity of it.
179540	184020	Um, I've got concerns then again, I came back from Disneyland just fine.
184020	185980	I was gonna say let's talk about the happy stuff.
185980	187460	You weren't here last week.
187460	188940	No, no surgery.
188940	191460	It was a birthday thing that you were doing last week.
191460	192460	Yeah, it was my birthday.
192460	194420	My birthday is very important holiday.
194420	197660	But you you went to Disneyland.
197660	198660	I did.
198660	208340	I am I had a very, very good time, although my body certainly reminded me that it it's
208340	217640	it's not a teenager, even though I tried to run around like I was so, so it actually my
217640	223780	whole thing started before then because Sunday I wasn't I wasn't here.
223820	231700	So what I ended up doing is I drove down on Sunday kind of rushed my way down and stayed
231700	240860	with Marissa, and Chris is our lovely friend, Marissa, who has been on the show a few times
240860	248180	and been in chat does some voice acting stuff, which is Yeah, I haven't seen Marissa in years.
248180	251660	So it was a really pleasant visit.
251660	254300	So you had a good time.
254300	260420	And then, and the area that that the two of them live in is actually really pretty.
260420	265460	I'd never been to the Moorpark before.
265460	266960	And it's sort of up in the hills.
266960	271300	And it was a little bit harrowing of a drive because my maps took me kind of a backwards
271300	272300	way.
272300	276500	But I'm glad it did because it was really pretty.
276780	284740	And then the next day, I went to pick up Tiara, which cements how much I hate LAX.
284740	295300	And so I managed to get Tiara out of the clutches of the the worldway traffic.
295300	301540	And we went to Anaheim and had sort of a late lunch at this place called Requiem, which
301540	305140	is a Final Fantasy themed coffee bar.
305140	306900	I had no idea there was a place like that.
306900	307900	That's cool.
307900	308900	It's beautiful.
308900	309900	Oh, awesome.
309900	313900	It's not far from the park, you know, so it's near where our hotel was, even though I got
313900	316820	bad directions because I put in the wrong days in.
316820	318460	There's like 50 million days in.
318460	319460	Oh, yeah.
319460	325220	They're all days in by the park, need to specify which ones which.
325220	329100	So so we spent a really decent amount of time there.
329100	333820	It was really, really, you know, and they serve you like these little toasties.
333820	342500	I had a Caprice one, which was, you know, basil and mozzarella and tomato, and it had
342500	346060	this like really good balsamic glaze on it.
346060	352420	And I laughed because Tiara had edamame toast, and I was calling it Japanese beans on toast
352420	360700	because edamame beans, you know, and and then we went to the hotel.
360700	364780	We had like dinner at Shakey's, which I've never been to Shakey's Dan thinks that I didn't
364780	366760	even know they still existed.
366760	369820	That's what blew my because you texted me that right next door to our hotel.
369820	373500	Yeah, you texted me that you were a tiara at Shakey's and I was like, they're still
373500	374500	around.
374500	377020	Like they all the Did you know the original I mean, you probably didn't but I'm gonna
377020	378020	share it anyway.
378020	380540	The original Shakey's pizza was in Sacramento.
380540	382620	The very first Shakey's pizza was Sacramento.
382620	384660	It's now the mimosa house down on 65th.
384660	386380	That was the original Shakey's.
386380	389940	So I and I remember Dan telling me about it before.
389940	394620	Yeah, and it's it's it's wild that like they're still open because they are they're all gone
394620	395620	here.
395620	396620	I haven't seen one in years.
396620	398660	But yeah, the the big wooden doors.
398660	399660	Yeah.
399660	403660	And the arcade they always had a really big arcade area like most roundtables games there.
403660	404660	Yeah.
404660	411540	I really wanted to play like like a deer hunting and some Oh, like, well, it's a Walmart arcade
411540	412540	at this point.
412540	413540	Gross.
413540	414540	Kind of.
414540	417860	Um, but they put way too much basil on my pizza.
417860	421300	I was like, I love basil and this is excessive.
421300	431740	So and so the next day we went in for opening and our mutual friend Nick was came to meet
431740	438460	us and I he actually ran into traffic so it was a little bit late but then he hung out
438460	445820	for a decent time traffic in LA what no no Nick straight next streamer here on Twitch
445820	453380	you and I have both rated him a million times yeah so really just just a cool guy all together
453380	460580	really sweet really fun to hang out with and then after after a little bit he rode a California
460580	465840	screaming with us or not screaming it's a credit coaster yeah credit coaster yeah and
465840	470860	and we we we just had a really good time and then he had to go off and it was me and tiara
470860	478060	for a while and we had dinner at Carthay circle I got a really delicious drink it's
478060	484380	like branding creme de cacao and coffee and cream but it like it kind of got my stomach
484380	489540	funny and I had Moroccan meatballs which I should have realized that there was going
489540	493580	to be something spicy in it so I ended up like having a slight allergic reaction but
493580	498980	it wasn't bad but I mean I got to pilot the Millennium Falcon I wish I had been right
498980	504620	pilot next time I want to be a gunner the gunners look like they had a lot more fun
504620	507180	is the gunner the one that just pushes the button the whole time because I think that's
507180	511020	what I did that's the engineer okay that's why I just yeah I just kept pushing a button
511020	515020	in the back row you're an engineer I thought I was in the middle but I it was a while ago
515020	519940	then you're a gunner okay I don't remember it was a while ago the pilots had a decent
519940	524380	amount of stuff to do but I I wanted to do the hyperdrive so I'm gonna wait and do that
524380	531900	next time it was really really cool I I had a good time with that one I really enjoyed
531900	539260	it the sense of motion was fairly realistic too and we did you know we did Haunted Mansion
539260	545820	we did Indy we did Jungle Cruise we had a really really good tour guide who I'm fairly
545820	552860	certain was non-binary and had some really funny Mean Girls oriented jokes fun did you
552860	558380	get to do Rise of the Resistance or too crazy I didn't do Rise of the Resistance it had
558380	562620	I didn't put in for the thing and honestly I was like it's a hassle the only thing I
562620	569300	really wanted to do was with Smugglers Run okay I had blue milk I will go on record right
569300	576500	now saying that if your throat is sore drink the blue milk it is somewhat coating and very
576500	580720	relaxing but the other good news it's been a week now since you've been back and no symptoms
580720	588440	of the big C so and I did a rapid test oh good good and so my rapid test was negative I also
588440	595120	though on the way out after I took Tiara to LAX I had lunch with Nick again and I was supposed to
595120	603160	meet Isaac oh but work got in the way of that so it was just me and Nick and we went to really good
603160	612400	yakiniku place hmm it's like the Japanese version of Korean barbecue yummy so um really good and
612400	618640	then I had I stopped at the grapevine after the grapevine to get myself a massage and one of those
618640	624400	like beat-you-up massage chairs because they're great and then I was checking the time for the
624400	632320	Bravo cheese farm which is my other resort that I go to 99 or 5 version 99 okay because I always
632320	636480	take 99 back that's the one for me is the one I go to that has the llama that gives no fucks
636480	641400	because you know they built one like at the exact same place on i-5 yeah it's funny it's yeah two
641400	647380	of them I know but I have to go to the one on 99 that's the one hmm and so I thought oh no they
647380	657640	close at seven so I booked it I like was doing a hundred in my Fiat TV I made it on 99 like I
657640	663720	there's a part so so for those not from the area there's two major freeways 99 with me you know I
663720	668320	know but I was to say for those not from from the California there's two major freeways that connect
668320	674400	like Sacramento NorCal and LA you can take 99 or the five it's it's and five is usually like
674400	681240	trucker route cows nothing there 99 goes through all the towns like Stockton Modesto Fresno Bakersfield
681240	687280	like all the towns in the valley you're going through on 99 so there's more to do on 99 but
687320	691280	five is the one where you can drive a little faster because there's like no but less people
691280	696440	on it but truckers and you know cows inside of the road now more cops on five now it doesn't
696440	700360	totally surprise me people people do drive crazy on five like not just me they were doing some
700360	708720	construction though on 99 but I was I was pretty I mean I drive a Fiat so when the lanes went narrow
708720	715680	I could still maintain speed and it was it wasn't that bad but when I got there they're like oh no
715680	721680	we're open till eight we changed it we just didn't do it on our website and I'm like fuck's sake so I
721680	727680	hung around and they have more animals there but that that alpaca still gives no fucks he was just
727680	733840	like I'm just gonna sit here whatever I'm bored I made friends with a goat and then I watched the
733840	739200	funniest thing I actually have this little video of it where there's a bunny hutch now oh by the
739200	744360	way I played with Marissa's bunny Snoopy who I I'm in love with that rabbit I'm gonna go back and
744400	749120	steal him but the bunnies in the hutch like I caught two of them they look like they were
749120	752920	just cuddling so they like a little video of the bunnies cuddling and then the other bunnies okay
752920	759240	it's time to fuck and the girl bunnies like fuck you I'm not into this and she like bounces off and
759240	763320	the bunnies following or trying to mount again over and over and finally she just like turns
763320	769080	around at him and then she bounces off and he finally gets the idea but I'm like you tell him
769320	775040	you tell him little girl bunny tell him you are not down you tell him to take no for an answer
775040	780360	lady bunny all right not being lady bunny I didn't mean that in lady bunny way she didn't
780360	785200	have on nearly enough wigs let me let me go to the chat believe it or not it's a video game podcast
785200	790120	we'll get into that too but I do want to go to the chat over at twitch.tv slash of hog network
790120	794440	where we do tape live every Sunday night nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after
794440	798600	the Bobby Blackwell show and Mike Deft is asking the five covers the whole state doesn't it
799160	806840	yeah it ends in TJ it like the San Diego and Mexico border that's where five starts in the
806840	811160	south and it goes all the way it goes through Portland through Seattle all the way and ends
811800	816680	in Canada at that that town I can't remember the name of the town way up there in North
816680	822120	Washington but basically Vancouver because they change the freeway changes names you get into
822120	826280	Canada but basically it takes you to Vancouver Bellevue no Bellevues before now it's another
826280	831560	B name but I can't remember the name off top my head but way up way up it's not far north of
831560	835160	Seattle it's only like as I think the Canadian border is only like an hour or two north of
835160	841560	Seattle if that so yeah but anyway yeah five five is preferred I still prefer 99 it goes three lanes
841560	845640	more often you've got more truck stops you know yeah there's more to do there's more to see
846600	854120	exactly and for me given that I'm still having that issue with you know my alertness
854120	860440	for me being able to stop like that it was a good idea sorry I have cat drama going on behind me
860440	865480	like smoosh always arguing yeah smoosh just chased cheddar in here I'm trying to see
866920	870120	I can't even see where cheddar ended up he must have went behind the couch they ran in here so
870120	876360	fast don't worry I'm sure folks in chat are dying to see the cats if I if I catch one of them I'll
876360	880520	show them on stream don't worry so but yeah they're still they're still getting used to
881080	885400	they're still getting used to each other so is cheddar coming out of his uh little shell a bit
885400	890680	more he is oh he's at my feet he's he's getting better he's less shy than he was but like smoosh
890680	895320	will pick on him like smoosh is starting to be an aggressor smoosh will like follow him around and
895320	899960	then like do this thing where he goes and like snort like right at him like he's and then cheddar
899960	905240	just books it and smoosh will follow him like that's their way of like playing lately now
905240	911960	cheddar's like at my feet and refuses to move super adorable so anyway you hear any meowing
911960	919160	that's what's going on is they're basically taunting each other so all right wait cheddar
919160	925720	cheddar hold on buy me time dark sagra okay um I have five dollars and that will buy you two
925720	934040	seconds of time haha um I don't know if smoosh is trying to be dominant though it just doesn't seem
934040	939480	cheddar didn't like that oh yeah well cheddar is a very shy boy yeah he is
941160	947000	so he let me he let me uh boop his nose he's super adorable like whenever I'm napping or
947000	953720	I'm asleep cheddar will run in and like wants to like lie on top of me and purrs really loud he's
953720	960040	just I think he's very very happy to be um indoors because we were it's interesting so I started
960040	966120	cheddar and instagram and just through the whole process the people that found cheddar actually
966120	971000	follow him on instagram because the adoption agency like you know we were we were fine with
971000	974840	the link being given out or whatever so they they put him in touch and so we got to see because I
974840	980280	I looked at one of the instagram and I got I could see um that uh I could see a picture of cheddar
980280	985240	when he was found and they really cleaned him up like he he was not in good shape when he was found
985240	989560	so but he's so adorable now you have to send me that link later yeah I will for sure
990040	998040	so uh pod culture and chat says so is one more each dad's kitty it does seem right now anyway
998040	1002680	that smoosh follows alan around a little more and cheddar follows me around a little more but
1002680	1007640	I don't like I also really don't want to play favorites like I love them both um it's just you
1007640	1014040	know whatever it's what it is so yeah all right uh let's get into some video game news I mean we
1014040	1019320	could have a cat podcast tonight I suppose you know considering that Pax East was this weekend
1019320	1023720	I feel like the news is still a little bit light all things considered so you know what we probably
1023720	1028920	could fill up three hours about cats but we will get into the news and we're going to start tonight
1028920	1033560	talking about Nintendo and you know uh workers rights in the video game industry is something
1033560	1038440	that's really been a theme on our show for the past couple years honestly and everything really
1038440	1042760	came to a climax when we were talking about Activision Blizzard and still everything that's
1042760	1048520	going on there I know you have an update on that later in the show um but this week the eye of
1048520	1053800	workers rights in the industry has turned to Nintendo um there's a lot of game blogs are
1053800	1059400	are talking about a Nintendo staffer who says that their right to unionize was violated and this is
1059400	1066680	per a complaint that was filed with the national labor relations board um this also it should should
1066680	1072760	be very important to point out this is a lot to do with contractors rights as well because
1072760	1079000	contractors are really used a lot in the gaming industry I think more than is talked about quite
1079000	1086280	honestly um contractors sometimes known as like temp agencies is another you know big thing
1086280	1092520	contractors are a way to find labor very fast because a lot of your contractors have already
1092520	1097640	done things like screening interviewing and so forth so they know that somebody's like ready to
1097640	1104360	go um and you it's it's a good way a lot of times for companies to find uh folks to hire long term
1104360	1110840	as well I got my job that I was at for 14 years through through a contractor temp temp agency
1112040	1117240	yeah I'm heading on nine years so it's it you know for first but of course dark soccer and I
1117240	1124760	also don't work in the games industry so it's uh you know um but this uh uh contracting company
1124760	1131640	that Nintendo uses um Aston Carter which is a global hiring firm uh the uh worker is uh
1131640	1137800	basically claiming the both of them violated their legal legally protected right to unionize and this
1137800	1142680	was a complaint that was made with the national labor relations board on Friday what happens is
1142680	1147800	that this contractor alleges that Nintendo of America and Aston Carter said they did concerted
1147800	1154600	activities and quote coercive actions to interfere with their right to organize um now the
1154600	1159960	filing only has broad charges so we don't know like who was involved what was involved we don't
1159960	1166200	know any of the specifics but per report from Axios quote the allegations were likely to include
1166200	1173320	claims of surveillance threats retaliation and either a layoff or refusal to hire um that's also
1173320	1180600	mentioned in a similar article from protocol um there will be an investigation but a lot of folks
1180600	1185080	saying you know what probably not nothing's going to happen uh a University of California Berkeley
1185080	1191240	professor and labor expert Harley Shaken said in an interview if the NLRB is listing these
1191240	1197880	allegations it's pretty serious and their ability to act is very real after these allegations came
1197880	1204680	out a twitter user known as the boy came out and said they worked at Nintendo and said working for
1204680	1209880	Nintendo contract for three years was one of the most stressful and awful experiences of my life
1209880	1214280	co-workers were great but i was constantly under pressure of being let go for little things like
1214280	1219240	going to the bathroom or being stuck in traffic an extra two minutes before work additionally they
1219240	1224120	have an awful practice of dangling the carrot a full-time employee to contract so they almost
1224120	1229800	universally never hire on just to keep exploiting them and keep them quiet i spoke up to try and
1229800	1236760	better things for co-workers main reason i was let go tbh um again a lot of this to me speaks
1236760	1242600	to contractors rights i mean there's a few things going on with this story right number one we've
1242600	1247240	said from the very beginning since these Activision Blizzard reports came out and even before that
1247240	1252920	this is an industry problem right so if you thought Nintendo was immune from this type of
1252920	1260920	stuff i mean surprise now i get Nintendo of America i guess we could be thankful for a moment
1260920	1265960	at least we're not hearing anything about sexism or you know some of those more serious things
1265960	1271240	we've heard coming out of the activisions and like you know uh that that whole he was gonna
1271240	1274760	kill his secretary or something allegedly i'm sorry i'm totally butchering the quotes but there
1274760	1279960	was some really messed up stuff that came out of the activision stuff right you know i i feel
1279960	1285800	awkward sitting here going at least it's just contractors rights but i don't i don't want to
1285800	1291560	diminish the situation either i mean this whole thing about they could get fired for the littlest
1291560	1298440	thing this is why a lot of companies and not just the tech industry quite frankly go to contractor
1298440	1306600	agencies because yeah it is really easy to let somebody go sometimes i think the contractor
1306600	1311800	agencies are predatory practice i see but it's it's weird because i also feel like it's biting
1311800	1315640	the hands that feed me a little bit because sometimes it's worked out my favor in the past
1315640	1320840	you know as far as like getting in with a big company um it just felt though for some of us
1321960	1329320	i would expect the majority don't work out yeah no and i i'm i'm all for like this whole
1329320	1335800	practice of how this works getting scrutinized and getting looked at and contractors rights
1335800	1341800	being taken seriously please don't misunderstand me with what i'm saying um but i just say this
1342040	1347320	a lot of these things that are being talked about i don't think are unique to tech either i think
1347320	1355800	this is a lot with contractors and you know just in general how that all works so uh going to the
1355800	1361160	chat because you know our chat is going to light up at this uh over at twitch.tv slash vog network
1361160	1365800	deejirama says i kind of think that this person is mad that nintendo wouldn't flip their contract
1365800	1373880	over to fte maybe so i mean but you know we talked about like the dangling carrot and all
1373880	1379480	of that stuff maybe there is a frustration there you give and give and give and you expect that you
1379480	1383400	know maybe you're going to move up the ladder maybe get some of the benefits you know and
1383400	1387480	stuff that comes with being a full-time employee maybe it does get frustrating when time and again
1387480	1395000	that doesn't happen for whatever so uh fanara in chat says contractors equals first one out the
1395000	1402280	door yes as well like if there's ever a layoff or something like that almost always yeah contractors
1402280	1410440	like unless they're highly specialized almost always yeah um deejirama s also says well even
1410440	1414360	as a contractor you have to still follow the handbook of the company but they really can't
1414360	1421480	fire you over silly stuff um quest bus they can reach out to the the contracting company and say
1421480	1427400	that you're not a good fit i i have seen it and i i'll speak openly about this because it's not
1427400	1432200	my current company and it's not you know anything where any of us are affiliated with currently but
1432200	1438280	i've absolutely seen it where a person didn't show up to work for two days in a row and somebody
1438280	1441640	would call the contract agency and say could you just let them know we don't need them back
1441640	1446600	and send somebody else and it didn't even it didn't even really matter what the reason is
1446760	1452280	just they they we needed them they weren't here let's do somebody else and that's what you know
1452280	1457960	happens with contractors um and they can totally do it as retaliation i i was working with a
1457960	1464520	mortgage company once that they were violating several federal laws and i called them on it
1465480	1469880	and i told them why and i showed them the laws and like when i do this work i'm going to be
1469880	1474840	documenting every piece of it i'm not going to have anything that i do come back and bite me
1475480	1479400	and they let me go and yeah and then i filed it and then i filed a complaint and the company
1479400	1484520	was gone a year later yeah and you know you know she just doesn't fit in with the culture here
1486440	1488360	yeah i'm not gonna break the law for you
1490440	1495080	anyway well they didn't last the the year because i'm not the only one that filed the complaint too
1495080	1503720	yeah so anyway um just that's you know uh what's going on at uh nintendo uh is under oops sorry um
1505400	1509240	i'm having problems with my computer over here where did discord go okay there we go
1509240	1515800	okay um but uh another thing i wanted to say about this whole nintendo uh news is that nintendo did
1515800	1523080	comment on the situation um so nintendo said we are aware of the claim which was filed with the
1523080	1528600	national labor relations board by a contractor who has previously terminated for the disclosure
1528600	1535720	of confidential information and for no other reason but that see i kind of like i get what
1535720	1542440	nintendo's doing here and covering their butt but i kind of think that reason like they were watching
1542440	1547640	him and he said something to somebody and they just they jumped on it you know what i mean like
1547640	1551880	i i don't know this seems a little bit of a stretch to me but whatever i'm not i'm not there
1551880	1557720	i don't know the specifics whatever uh nintendo is not aware of any attempts to unionize or related
1557720	1562280	activity and intends to cooperate with the investigation conducted by the nlrb
1562280	1566040	nintendo is fully committed to providing a welcoming and supportive work environment for
1566040	1571800	all our employees and contractors we take matters of employment very seriously well then i would be
1571800	1577640	curious what they have to say about the twitter user i talked about as well and other former
1577640	1584120	employees whether they be full-time or contractor i've heard other stuff as well that wasn't posted
1584120	1591400	as publicly um that's rather interesting so uh you know it was really just a matter of time
1591400	1597080	before your fav in the industry had a good good look at it as well and so here's now you know
1597080	1603320	nintendo's turn to look at what are they doing right what are they doing wrong so interesting
1603960	1608840	anyhow let's move on and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week
1608840	1613480	in how was your gaming week dark soccer i know you were at disneyland but did you
1613480	1621240	fit in any uh video gaming in your week um yeah i mean i i streamed so i played dead by daylight
1621240	1628120	and i played second and said to three um i have four of the mana beasts down or whatever they're
1628120	1635320	calling them the the nevadons i think is what they're calling them i i just think of them as
1635320	1641800	the mana beast um so um halfway through them and then i think after that after the other four then
1641800	1649480	i have the last fight so and then i've beaten the game and i'm moving on to tear enigma probably
1649480	1657720	whoa yeah um and dead by daylight i'm kind of i don't know i just like i didn't have any
1657720	1662120	concentration yesterday so i was just sort of being you know whatever about the game
1662120	1668040	it's just sort of like i don't care all right they won yeah whatever okay good sure yeah you
1668040	1675400	can boop my demo dog i'm still going to tear you to pieces i actually played demo it was kind of
1675400	1680840	fun he's a cute puppy i i didn't i haven't touched it by daylight all week i don't know what it is
1680840	1684360	i'm not like consciously trying to avoid it or anything i just kind of feel like the game's in
1684360	1691080	a bit of a lull for me right now i still play regularly for consistency it's also like double
1691080	1699320	experience yeah i heard that was going on this weekend the eerie shards yeah but um um i'm still
1699320	1704360	i still have fun i get frustrated sometimes and yeah like fanara just said new rift comes out on
1704360	1710520	the 27th oh that's right it's a twins rift yeah twins and david maybe i'll log in for that yeah
1711640	1716760	yeah so i have to see if there's anything you know worthwhile in it that i want that would
1716760	1722040	make it worth paying for so i mean i like i who am i kidding i like all the cosmetics so
1722040	1726040	i already have enough of a what is the orange shards i forget what they're called the oric
1726040	1730120	cells that's it i have enough of those on my account to buy the rift i probably will whatever
1730120	1736760	who cares i've actually i once paid for a whole rift as in like paid to advance on it oh wow
1736760	1742680	okay and that was for all the pig stuff uh okay got it because i'm sorry i'm the pig mane
1742680	1751000	um but no other other than that uh those are you know that my my wordscapes i'm still kind
1751000	1761000	of addicted um didn't really do much else um yeah right just i didn't even play astro blasters
1762520	1768520	um my gaming week uh honestly not a lot of new stuff it's it's two of my standbys i played a
1768520	1773960	lot of both i played more no man's sky i actually was really good with my streaming this week i
1773960	1778360	you know ever since the move and my life getting you know the raid turned upside down yeah you're
1778360	1783320	welcome um it's since all that kind of turned things upside down um i've been getting back
1783320	1788120	into streaming more regularly so i stream monday tuesday wednesday and one other day whatever day
1788120	1794120	i rated you friday maybe so um yeah i've been streaming more it's weird um but i played no man
1794120	1799320	sky on monday and i think friday stream the night i rated you i think i was playing that too
1799320	1805880	um and uh yeah no man's sky i i beat expedition six so i cleared everything with that expedition
1805880	1810840	and as annoying as it was with the increased pirate raids i think it made me a better no man's
1810840	1816040	sky player for one it forced me to do an element of the game i don't normally you know pay attention
1816040	1820840	to which is the combat stuff i would actually say it's probably the easiest expedition well
1821160	1826440	the normandy one was probably the easiest and that was more because of the length it was designed to
1826440	1832120	only be like a two-week expedition so you had to beat it in like five hours of game time um so that
1832120	1836280	was probably the easiest one but i would say six was probably the second easiest one uh if you're
1836280	1840760	willing to do the combat fights now i know bobby's talked about this on his show he really does not
1840760	1846280	like to do the fighting he's more of a pacifist player and i get it like if you don't like to do
1847080	1851480	the combat this latest patch is kind of annoying because they added
1851480	1857480	more opportunities to get fights picked with you but another thing i learned is that you can pretty
1857480	1862280	much run away from anything as long as you don't engage if you keep running one direction long
1862280	1866840	enough or flying long enough in one direction you can get out of it without engaging it's just
1866840	1872440	annoying because you know like a lot of things no man's sky you're doing one thing and then squirrel
1872440	1877400	something else comes up uh that's just how the game goes but i enjoyed my experience in the
1877400	1882600	expedition so much that like friday i was just like you know what i want to continue in this
1882600	1889640	new game that i started because um i beat the beat the expedition like an hour into monday's stream
1889640	1893400	and it was the last day for twitch drops and twitch drops take about three hours so i was like
1893400	1897400	you know i'm gonna try to do a three hour stream let's just start a new game let's do a new game
1897400	1901640	with all these rewards i've been collecting through twitch drops and everything so i started
1901640	1906280	the game and then i kind of found like i was missing it i kind of want to play that game again
1906280	1912440	um so i did on friday and um advanced my game and i probably will stream that a couple more
1912440	1920120	days this week so i just i like no man's sky is just a relaxing game and the nice thing about
1920120	1923880	streaming it is that you know enough especially with the twitch drops a lot more people were
1923880	1927880	coming into chat but even on friday when there were no drops you know some some of the peeps
1927880	1933000	that i've known for a long time thanks to olr and hanging in other communities just coming in just
1933000	1938120	chilling out hey what's up you know this game is still pretty but just talking about stuff while
1938120	1946440	i'm blasting rocks for dust so um yeah quest buster says i just found out that you can make
1946440	1951880	squadrons and have a wingman warp in when you get into a fight they're not that great but they give
1951880	1957240	the pirate something else to shoot at yes you don't really learn about that until the very end
1957240	1964280	of expedition six but as soon as you get your freighter which in the main story or any time
1964280	1969720	really it's in the game's code if you do five warps galaxy warps your fifth galaxy warp you
1969720	1975880	will always warp into a freighter fight if you kill the pirates which isn't that hard you the
1975880	1979960	freighter will invite you aboard and the captain will be like i'm sick of this why don't you take
1979960	1985240	my freighter and you can get the freighter the minute you get that you can unlock at one of the
1985240	1991400	panels squadron mates and they cost nanites like most things in the game does um but they're it's
1991400	1996360	pretty easy to recruit at least one and uh yeah they'll fight by your side in some of those battles
1996360	2002120	which is uh pretty nice so something to think about um anyway also i've been playing follow
2002120	2008840	fantasy 14 because i was sidetracked by no man's sky with the expedition that was timed over easter
2008840	2016120	weekend i um was neglecting the 6.1 patch in follow fantasy 14 which i finally caught up with this
2016120	2020840	week so i streamed on tuesday and wednesday night shane joined me we did some dungeons i've done
2020840	2025400	the new dungeon i did the new raid i didn't do that on stream i ended up doing that um like
2025400	2031720	yesterday saturday or something i don't remember uh so yeah so uh been enjoying the patch in 6.1
2031720	2036760	final fantasy i'm playing sage for the first time which is one of the new classes that came out with
2036760	2043000	endwalker and it's funny because i i played it for the very first time on stream on wednesday
2043000	2048200	and i think you hear me sitting there kind of going none of these words make sense none of this
2048200	2053880	thing makes sense none of but now that i've played it and i'm up to like level 76 now um i actually
2053880	2059000	really enjoy the rhythm of sage it's a very like fast pace there's always something going on type
2059000	2065000	of healer where you're doing damage and healing and barriering and so it's very like satisfying
2065000	2069080	when you do it well but it can be tricky to get the hang of it first but i'm enjoying my adventure
2069080	2073080	in sage right now in final fantasy and i'll probably take it to 90 honestly so that'll
2073080	2080120	probably be the next class i get to the end game i still have yet to look at the pvp in final fantasy
2080120	2085240	but that's kind of on like my list of things to do hopefully in this next week so that's pretty much
2085240	2090600	my gaming week uh mike deft in our chat talks about most of my gaming this week has been pokemon
2090600	2095640	either go or unite which some kirby thrown in there and that does remind me you know i don't
2095640	2101400	talk about the um gps games but i should because they do take a lot of my attention yesterday was
2101400	2107560	like niantic community day where they were doing stuff in all three games so pokemon go had the
2107560	2114200	stuff old debut and all that stuff in the shinies um and pikmin had a you know their community day
2114200	2121080	for tulips so i walked 17 000 steps yesterday because in the morning i was walking with my
2121080	2126520	pic my ingress friends although there was a thing going on in ingress but it was kind of like
2126520	2131720	very passive and not like so we we weren't even playing ingress we were doing pikmin and walking
2131720	2137720	that and i got like 9 000 steps just walking with my friends and then i went back to the i had to
2137720	2141560	pick up my sister at the airport i went back downtown after all that and i went out for
2141560	2146520	stuffle community day and walked another like 8 000 steps walking around the capital several times
2146520	2153560	so but i caught 19 shiny stuffles like it was again and i only blew i only bluetooth caught
2153560	2161400	the whole time um it was one of those things where i was like i i after an hour and a half i was like
2161400	2167320	i don't need this many stuffles i have 19 what am i going to do with these uh i'm done i have
2167320	2174520	1200 candies i'm kind of done so but i had a very productive day so that was my like niantic day so
2174520	2179720	i always forget to talk about the gps games but i play plenty of those as well it's not always just
2179720	2186200	final fantasy and no man's sky whatever standbys i have also i played my burger time machine
2187720	2191960	a little bit today really yeah i was trying to see if i could get the if i could get cheddar
2191960	2196360	to be interested in it because smush really likes the light and the noise and i was trying to see if
2196360	2199880	i could get cheddar interested in it so i played it a little bit to get the noise and all that
2199880	2204360	he didn't care he didn't care so it's interesting how cats like different things that's for sure
2205480	2211320	yeah midna would rather just like sit at the at the glass door and just watch everything outside
2211320	2216360	you know cat tv no smush used to like get up on top of it and all that stuff too but now the
2216360	2220920	cheddar's here he's his pastime is very much watching and patrolling whatever cheddar does
2221720	2228520	so anyway all right let's get into some more video game headlines for this week i hope you all had a
2228520	2234520	good week uh whether it was you know playing video games uh or going to something like pax east was
2234520	2240520	this weekend um i know that was the first convention um in a long time for a lot of people
2241080	2247400	i also know pax east did hecka precautions uh with mandated vaccines and masking so hopefully
2247400	2251320	everything is okay i always think it's a good idea if you're going to go to a convention like
2251320	2256760	that or whatever at least take a rapid test honestly just take the the nose swab test from
2257320	2261400	uh a medical provider like three days don't do it the day after do it like three four days
2261400	2266920	after just to make sure i think it's just always a good idea um i plan on going to dragon con over
2266920	2271400	labor day i'm sure there will be precautions that's fine and i will take a test as soon as i
2271400	2276200	get back just just to make sure just to be thorough but the reality is in this day and age
2276200	2281000	you go anywhere with a lot of people covet's going to be there somewhere you know you everybody
2281000	2286520	heard the story uninvited guest yeah everybody heard the story at gdc about the person who knew
2286520	2291960	they had covid and went to the industry parties anyway and that's just the reality is that's the
2291960	2297960	grocery store that's transit that's the airport that's a restaurant that is anywhere a lot of
2297960	2301800	people hang out somebody is going to go full well knowing that they have covid so if you're going
2301800	2306760	to be in close proximity with people in any of those situations look out for yourself you know
2306760	2314040	just unless unless you truly don't care then i hope you have a speedy recovery that's that's uh
2314040	2322200	like those people yeah it's that's all i got so all right moving on let's talk about in games
2322200	2330600	uh headline from ubisoft you know ubisoft not only in the working conditions uh environment but in the
2330600	2336040	nft's environment has been in headlines a lot lately which makes this headline very
2336040	2343400	interesting about a new project they are working on called project q and a tweet for ubisoft wrote
2343960	2351160	introducing code name project q a team battle arena letting players truly own the experience
2351160	2355880	the game is an early development and we will keep testing so for now all you can do is register for
2355880	2362120	upcoming tests well you see they kind of were forced their hand on sharing this because a
2362120	2368840	leaker out there actually shared footage of the game uh saying that it looked a little bit like
2368840	2374200	overwatch meets fortnite uh it's kind of what it looked like there was a mode called showdown where
2374200	2379800	four teams of two go against one another to decide the winner and battle zone sees two teams of four
2379800	2384680	going against each other to see who gets 100 points first but even though folks are saying
2384680	2389480	oh it's overwatch meets fortnite ubisoft was quick to say this isn't a battle royale game
2390440	2395080	which is so it's interesting to see ubisoft saying no it's not that not that by the way this
2395080	2401560	is not a battle royale the game will feature a variety of pvp modes with one single goal in mind
2402200	2406280	fun fun is the goal
2406280	2414520	yeah i like fun too we'll see we'll see if it passes the the rob roberts and dark sakura fun
2414520	2420680	test to be determined at a later date um also and i what also kind of cracks me up about this
2420680	2429800	ubisoft also went to say there are no nfts in project q um because selling point ubisoft has
2429800	2434280	been known to promote well it also goes to show what a big company ubisoft is you have different
2434280	2439240	developers within ubisoft so i think this team is probably trying to separate itself from some
2439240	2444520	of the other things ubisoft is known for which i think is very interesting so uh again if you want
2444520	2451800	to what was that oh i said let's hope yeah if you want to uh sign up to uh check out project q you
2451800	2459000	can do that over at register.ubisoft.com slash project q dash sign up uh and uh the project is
2459000	2466680	coming out for xbox one xbox series playstation four and five and pc uh let's hope this one lasts
2466680	2473880	and uh doesn't go the way of hyperscape which was a battle royale but apparently was not fun for
2473880	2480040	enough people because uh nobody was playing it and so they shut it down or they're shutting it down
2480040	2488440	but it is uh being uh and dated uh orange right is awarding one pat on the back for no nfts um
2488440	2496840	s2100 matt says letting us know there are no nfts gets one clap fifth fifth dream says a loud one
2496840	2504120	just sort of like a bad muted one like a like a golf clap no it was like this oh the hands just
2504680	2510920	there was an attempt at clapping um fifth dream in chat says pick a pick a better letter ubi
2511560	2515960	what's wrong with q what's what's your hatred with the letter q fifth dream
2516760	2521160	q's probably an amazing character i was just gonna say q's my favorite character and bond
2521160	2526440	what's wrong with that i i was actually talking about star trek oh that too star trek too
2526440	2531880	yeah let's remember some famous cues in history
2534680	2540600	anyway all right let's move on to our next story dark sakura what do you have for us next
2541640	2548840	well nintendo is doing something ahead of schedule um you know we often hear about like games being
2548840	2557400	delayed but we rarely hear about them coming out early and it looks that uh zenoblade chronicles
2557400	2564760	3 um is actually coming out two months ahead of schedule on july 29th um but it looks like that
2564760	2571080	instead of using whatever that early finish time you know to do more play testing and a
2571080	2577000	little bit more work on it they're just bringing it out so who knows what that's gonna mean but
2577880	2583960	we it's not like we haven't had games released early before uh like the upcoming game uh well
2583960	2590440	not upcoming it's already out but the sifu that came out um it was due february 22nd it came out
2590440	2597160	on february 8th and assassins creed 4 dropped early as well so it's not like we haven't had
2597160	2606760	a few come out earlier but i still think that the date should be maintained so that
2606840	2612120	again they can make sure that they have a good product here's why i'm gonna tell you 100 why
2612120	2616680	because it relates to something bobby blackwolf said they bobby blackwolf in our chat says they
2616680	2620920	probably have another game that will come out when xc3 was originally going to come out so they
2620920	2627960	rearrange things also in the news this week splatoon 3 which hadn't been dated yet but was
2627960	2635400	generally considered to be a summer game was given a date 9 9 2022 so it's going to get the dreamcast
2635400	2641000	day of 9 9 so that's getting a september release they're calling it a summer release because
2641000	2646360	technically you know summer runs through september 21st right so it's a summer release but it's it's
2646360	2653320	september summer so um that comment from bobby i think is 100 on the nose splatoon ended up taking
2653320	2659000	this i think i think splatoon got delayed but since they never said it was going to come out
2659000	2665240	on a certain day it's not a delay but i think the fact they're rearranging the calendar i think
2665240	2669320	goes to show that splatoon was probably originally going to be the july game
2669320	2673640	and ended up getting pushed back to september which you know if it needs more time than fine
2673640	2680040	whatever i think but it's it also interesting i just think xc3 has probably been done it's
2680040	2684680	probably been done and they're they're in the final stages of it and it was completely about
2684680	2689960	release strategy going into the holiday season and all of that absolutely but um
2689960	2695400	especially when it was already out there that xc2 and three were in development side by side so
2695400	2700840	three's probably been done for a few months now and it's really just a release release strategy
2700840	2705960	thing at this point and so now they don't want to compete against themselves although splatoon and
2705960	2711880	xenoblade are very different genres you're still asking nintendo fans who are probably interested
2711880	2717160	in both to plunk down 60 and another 60 so it's best if they space them out a little bit so that
2717400	2721960	they space them out a little bit so that you you know you'll pay 60 in july and then 60 in
2721960	2728680	september um on a somewhat related note i thought it was very interesting you know uh it was there
2728680	2732920	was a tweet going around earlier today that came across my timeline and it didn't make me stop and
2732920	2738840	go that is interesting that we're talking about xenoblade chronicles 3 being a tent pole release
2738840	2746920	essentially for the switch at this point right do you remember folks think back think back about 10
2747720	2753720	a little more think back to the wii era like 2008 2009 do you remember the first xenoblade chronicles
2753720	2763640	game and how nintendo wouldn't put it out in america and yeah how it took a little operation
2763640	2769800	rainfall to finally get that game to get released uh along with some other there were some other
2769800	2775880	games involved with that as well um but that game finally got released it was a gamestop exclusive
2775880	2782120	which i still to this day say was garbage but whatever at least it was released um and you know
2782120	2787160	because many people were just pirating it at that point i may or may not be one of them but that
2787160	2792280	game was so good uh at least it finally got in front of the eyes of other people and it's just
2792280	2797960	interesting to me how far we've come because since then then we had xenoblades chronicles x
2797960	2803160	on the wii u which you know it was wii u but i think it was still very well received as a wii u
2803160	2810120	title um and then of course the remaster came out for the switch and i i believe it did pretty well
2810120	2814520	uh well enough anyway to necessitate xenoblade chronicles two and three now so this is very
2814520	2823000	interesting that like this series is causing release strategy shifts in the u.s when nintendo
2823000	2828520	didn't even want to do this game in the u.s originally so can all of the supporters of
2828520	2835240	operation rainfall please just take a moment to say we were right and doesn't that feel good
2835880	2842360	doesn't that feel good uh bobby blackwolf says the lost story was the other one i think yes
2842360	2847480	there was that there was one other pandora something was the other there was one other
2847480	2852360	uh there was because there were three and they all did get released eventually um yeah so yeah
2852360	2857480	it was uh pandora's tower thank you orange right that was the other one so um they all did of
2857480	2863080	course the other two i don't think ever did get follow-ups uh was lost story a mistwalker title
2863640	2868680	there was it was from a studio everybody wanted to play it because it was from a particular studio
2869400	2875800	um but it never ended up yeah it was mistwalker so mistwalker kind of went a different direction and
2875800	2882280	now um fantasion is the most recent thing they've done right so um yeah so uh but last story i i kind
2882280	2887400	of Asian is great just you know annoying i wish they would revisit some of these you know it's
2888120	2894200	such a fascinating studio because they keep doing these rpgs that just don't stick for whatever
2894200	2900280	reason that's not i'm not talking about fantasion i'm talking about before that blue dragon i lost
2900280	2907720	odyssey so kind of turned a little bit weird did it yeah the thing the thing is is that like
2908280	2912440	playing through the game is easy the boss battles are harder than the advertised level
2912440	2918520	hmm uh and bobby blackwolf says it was the last story not the lost story you're probably mind
2918520	2923400	melding with lost odyssey which was also a mistwalker title it happens that was ways back
2923400	2927480	anyway i'm sorry i just had to point that out as i was like here we are talking about release date
2927480	2932360	strategies around zw a chronicles 3 when nintendo didn't even want to release the first one in the
2932360	2939000	us so i just think how far we've come and kudos to the fans for speaking up you know as much as we
2939080	2945400	talk about you know angry fanboys when it comes to nintendo i think operation rainfall did did
2945400	2950920	it appropriately and look at the look at the big victory here all these years later now we just
2950920	2955240	need the xenoblade chronicles x re-release on switch because a lot of people missed it on weu
2955240	2964040	and it had great music all right anyhow when before xenogears came out that they had a mention
2964040	2970280	of it in final fantasy 7 and no one got it because of how they spelled it right it was
2970280	2977000	when cloud was in the the wheelchair and not himself and one of the things he would mumble
2977000	2987880	was xenogias which is a literal romanization of how it would be spelled in katakana i love when
2987880	2993880	games subtly reference each other i love it it's like this little inside joke that only we get
2994920	2999320	i also i also love the concept of video games being set in like the same universe
3001000	3008040	evil is in final fantasy i love the concept of like tactics and final fantasy 12 and in my brain
3008040	3013400	in my head canon and i know i know yoshi p has come out and said no but in my head canon final
3013400	3020600	fantasy 14 is an evil is game um and i i i realize there are elements about the story that definitely
3020600	3026120	differentiate it from evil is but i it's it's uh it's an evil is in a different part of the
3026120	3032440	multiverse game to me and i think i think 16 will be an evil is game too to be quite honest i just
3032440	3036440	don't think that's been confirmed yet but that's that's maybe wishful thinking on my part but it
3036440	3041480	is creative unit 3 doing it and it's those are a lot of the people that worked on those games
3041480	3047800	so i think uh i think there's a strong chance 16 is an evil is game and i hope so so all right
3047800	3057800	moving on speaking of great things from the past dark soccer well um oh am i i'm sorry am i next
3057800	3062840	oh my bad i'm sorry you see you see what happens we lose one person for the night and the entire
3062840	3067720	rotation gets screwed up well you still left him in in the show role for another segment
3068680	3072520	well you know things happen that's right you were on last week's show always a part of the
3072520	3075720	show yeah i was like you were in last week's show even though you're at disneyland so
3075720	3080920	all right let's talk about this instead let's talk about nintendo uh and the nintendo switch
3080920	3087960	online and uh there's been a leak of the nintendo switch online uh because it includes unreleased
3087960	3096040	nes games um this was apparently something that was leaked over to um because this has to do with
3096040	3102680	another thing i'm going to talk about here uh oh this doesn't have the piece on the um gameboy
3102680	3108040	advance part hold on sorry i was looking at a story that talked about the nes titles that
3108040	3113000	have been discovered in the emulator as well but it all started with a gameboy gameboy color game
3113000	3120360	boy advance switch online emulator pack uh that was originally posted to 4chan sigh but leaks
3120360	3126920	happened there uh four files popped up on there and some twitter users braved 4chan to get in
3126920	3134520	there and talk and like see what's there uh there was a uh 7z archive that had loose nca's it was a
3134520	3140280	gameboy emulator uh made by nerd it's nintendo's team that works on other classics for switch
3140280	3146520	online the gameboy advance emulator calls sloop um so now some folks are saying you know 4chan
3146520	3152040	it's got a hit and miss type of track record but the consensus right now is that this one's legit
3152040	3157720	because builds of three nintendo switch online apps they're usable and they're playable
3157720	3162920	and they're a source code that has identifying information from nintendo devs so all the signs
3162920	3170920	point to this is legit otherwise this wouldn't catch fire the way it did um so we have news
3170920	3177800	that a gameboy advance emulator is being worked on uh for the uh nintendo switch and there are
3177800	3182760	games like pokemon pinball that show up in the list uh which i think are things that i would
3182760	3188840	love to play all over again i checked something trying to follow back a link on one of those
3188840	3197240	tweets and the account is dead the account's gone oh really yeah the one who was talking about the
3197240	3204200	analog support and the helco emulator i wonder if there was an nda so because i wonder if nintendo
3204200	3209160	maybe tried to shut it down or something who knows so that account is gone i wonder if this
3209160	3214440	other one is anyway the other one is still there that's very interesting some sometimes people
3214440	3217560	don't like the attention either and they might have changed their name to break all the links
3217560	3223720	or something i don't know so anyway um but this doesn't mean that it's coming tomorrow it doesn't
3223720	3229800	mean it's coming in june even it does it just means nintendo's working on it um but that could
3229800	3238200	be working out in the way future i thought it showed interesting things about um uh like how
3238200	3244440	they use save states to really practice some things in emulators and they actually had save
3244440	3249320	states that talked about like you know there's a certain texture used in this part of the game
3249320	3253960	and that they'll use those to test certain part of the emulators and that kind of made me click
3253960	3262040	and go aha that's where those sp releases are coming from you know how on the nso they
3262040	3268200	apparently like you know every other month or so they'll release like a kid Icarus sp edition
3268200	3273000	and all it is is basically a safe state that takes you directly to the last level in the game
3273000	3276680	so you can see how the very last level in kid Icarus is nothing like the rest of the game
3277240	3283880	it's it's very unique i i feel like those safe states some of them are just becoming the sp
3283880	3289320	edition of the game um or uh the other one that comes to mind it was one of the first ones they
3289320	3294840	ever did it was the legend of zelda um i don't remember what they called it but it was the money
3294840	3301720	filled edition it already had like every item 255 rupees it had like everything already unlocked and
3301720	3305720	i was like that was just a safe state for nintendo to test things in that game that's what that was
3306680	3313960	then they ended up releasing it as like a bonus game that's clever anyway the leak didn't just
3313960	3320040	leak that this gameboy advance uh emulators being worked on is that there was also unreleased nes
3320040	3328760	games including pac-man tetris galaga mega man castlevania lots of games that make you go wow
3328760	3335240	this really is missing it's also interesting to note the build date for the application october
3335240	3345000	2019 so they've been on this for a minute uh-huh now of course just because now see here's where
3345000	3350360	my brain goes i don't think just because the games were in the emulator they were ever being planned
3350360	3355160	on coming out because that's a licensing thing especially because this has all these mega man
3355160	3360840	games in there well hello capcom released a mega man's collection for the switch already they don't
3360840	3365000	want to just give these games to nintendo for free unless i mean maybe they'll they'll get a
3365000	3370920	money sharing thing later on but they're probably holding out but my guess is nintendo was probably
3370920	3377000	internally testing these to test the emulator to make sure that it was still good in case either
3377560	3382040	these games were ever just gonna you know they get the deal inked out these games come out someday
3382040	3389320	or um and i think this is the case with xbox or emulation in general and i know we have an
3389320	3394920	emulation expert in our discord server and i may or may not get corrected but just following this
3394920	3402040	over the years when you get a certain thing in emulation to work it usually causes other similar
3402040	3407320	games to work for example in the nintendo universe you hear a lot about mappers right you get one
3407320	3413480	mapper carpetridge type to work it usually means others that also run on that mapper will also work
3413480	3419080	i say xbox because i think back to that story when remember when like barbie dream adventures
3419720	3425400	ended up becoming a backwards compatible xbox 360 title everybody was like why did microsoft waste
3425400	3430200	their fucking time making that barbie game backwards compatible and i've been saying since
3430200	3436280	the beginning they didn't it's just another game that we don't know of that they did want to get
3436280	3442760	backwards compatible ran on a very similar type of coding structure engine something that the barbie
3442760	3447800	game did and so you know look at look at other games of that developer or that publisher did
3447800	3453160	and whatever microsoft did to get that game running also made barbie work and so i think
3453160	3457800	and that's my long-winded way of saying these mega man games showing up in this emulator build
3457800	3464680	may not really be about mega man it's probably more about the emulator because i i again i don't
3464680	3470120	see what capcom has to gain when they're selling these games independently for their own money
3470680	3476520	to just say okay nsl go ahead and release them on your service until they're sure that they're not
3476520	3481640	going to make any more money off that game and nintendo opens up their wallet enough so what do
3481640	3487080	you want to bet if these mega man games do show up it's going to be on the plus service expansion
3487080	3491800	pack whatever the fuck they call it because they need that extra money so that they can funnel some
3491800	3499800	of it over to capcom tetris i'm sure is a legal issue at this point um can they re-release the
3499800	3505720	old tetris i'm sure it's complicated granted they have tetris 99 but tetris 99 and the original
3505720	3508920	tetris on india they are different games and legally have to be treated differently
3510760	3515960	castlevania and simon's quest same logic why would konami just suddenly open those
3515960	3519400	up on nintendo switch online when they're trying to sell you the castlevania collection
3522440	3530920	so i i think some blogs and some people on twitter are reading too much into this and i
3530920	3537960	think maybe need to take a step back and go oh this is just more about testing the emulator or
3537960	3543400	maybe these games are ready to come out as soon as the deal gets inked legally but i don't know
3543400	3550680	if it will ever get inked legally pac-man um i hate to sound like a broken record but like
3550680	3555720	literally in the next two weeks there's a pac-man museum game coming out why does why does namco
3555720	3562360	want to put pac-man out on nso why they're trying to sell pac-man museum now i do look
3562360	3567720	at other games in here like kung fu the original kung fu on the nes which was an arcade game as
3567720	3576600	well i'm not sure why that game can't be released unless like was there an actual tie-in to
3576600	3583160	something that i'm just missing in the moment with that game legally but yeah that's interesting
3583160	3589640	i actually love that game by the way they must have some reasons yeah so i mean they
3590440	3593880	there's they don't have to tell us what the reasons are that's just the thing they don't
3593880	3600680	have to tell us but it's interesting the more people speculate on it that just generates more
3600680	3606680	publicity for them oh sure sure uh now this is interesting over in chat ah thank thank you
3606680	3612760	orange right kung fu was based on an iram arcade game kung fu master ding ding that's it that's
3612760	3617800	why it's legally still tied up i remember the arcade game being awesome and then they they
3617800	3623160	ported it pretty well to the nes so thank you everybody uh and dgrms says iram is too busy
3623160	3633480	milking r-type to deal with kung fu well yeah how many r-type finals have we um s2100 matt says i
3633480	3638120	remember when folks hacked the playstation classic and folks saw that they had tested a ton of other
3638120	3642600	games on it including anime fighting games the whole list of games they used to test on it would
3642600	3648360	have made that thing better than a dust collector for sure uh fifth dream in chat says maybe that
3648360	3655400	contract worker at nintendo from earlier leaked the emulators i don't think the contractor would
3655400	3663400	have access to those files but it's it's cute fanfic but probably not rooted in reality i'm
3663400	3670360	sorry to say yeah all right uh let's go on to our next story now we can go to dark sakura's story
3671320	3679880	so um well activision blizzard is doing something right um i mean then again they're kind of having
3679880	3690040	to do it they have to yeah yeah um so they are adding two uh women senior executives to the
3690440	3700200	board um they are announcing that uh lulu cheng miss messervay i guess that's how it's pronounced
3700200	3706360	is uh joining immediately and then they're nominating carrie kar for election in their
3706360	3713240	annual meeting in june um which so far they've actually uh activision blizzard has been in
3713240	3720120	violation of law that requires uh publicly traded companies with six or more people on the board
3720120	3728120	to have at least three women directors um and then half of activision's 10 person board has been
3728120	3735400	together for nearly uh two decades um eight men and two women currently sit on the board
3736040	3745160	um two however uh hendrick hart hartung the third and casey washerman have chosen not to go for
3745160	3758840	re-election so um so uh messervay is uh the vp of communication at substack and car is uh svp with
3758840	3766760	bacardi and an alum of the walt disney company so interesting there you go well the representation
3766760	3771240	is important it's interesting that there's you know the law and all that as well with the board
3771240	3777640	that's that's pretty neat um so it's good but um also i hope i hope these folks have been vetted
3777640	3782520	um because that's still important as well because the next story we have is about an executive who
3782520	3788600	is a woman who um maybe i don't allegedly not so great i don't know i've heard a lot of things
3788600	3793960	about this woman uh and she's on facebooks i actually have one more little thing to add on
3793960	3799160	please please if you don't mind yeah of course the soc investment group is actually urging investors
3799160	3808040	to vote against uh the activision blizzard acquisition the merger so um they own a small
3808040	3815560	percentage of activision stock um and they are calling for them to elect a new competent and
3815560	3821240	dedicated board of directors that's my quote um before it's going to go through and so i think
3821240	3828760	that this might be part of that this was announced uh last week i have heard of them going that in
3828760	3833880	there yeah no that's perfect i've heard of a lot of pushback to bobby kotex payout too you know
3833880	3839400	a lot of senators were voicing their opinions on that as well as that uh the deal shouldn't go
3839400	3844680	through because of bobby kotex payout his ass needs to be kicked to the curb paid out in rotten
3844680	3851160	prunes he needs to be paid out in a pink slip in a cardboard box like his contractors have he
3851160	3856840	should be given a bunch of prunes and be forced to eat it before he leaves well wait until you
3856840	3863880	hear what i have next dark sakura because it involves the tale of bobby kotek and the coo
3863880	3872520	or chief operating officer of facebook excuse me meta cheryl sandberg that's who i was referencing
3872520	3882200	a moment ago meta is under an investigation if cheryl sandberg broke company rules by um act by
3882200	3888760	uh basically trying to do a favor for activision ceo bobby kotek who she was dating at the time
3889720	3897160	oh how the world fuck i mean i just these bobby kotex stories anyone want to date him other than
3897160	3902280	maybe having him be a sugar daddy but she would have she would have enough money yeah like she's
3905560	3910760	i'm exhausted even just after the first sentence of this article but let me continue
3912760	3918440	according to a report in the wall street journal who keeps breaking these stories that going on
3918440	3923080	in the game industry so snaps and actual claps to the wall street journal and journalists who
3923080	3927160	are getting getting it fucking done uh when it comes to holding these companies accountable
3928440	3933640	uh according to this report so i have to say allegedly bold underlying italicize but according
3933640	3939160	to the report cheryl sandberg used company resources to kill negative reporting about
3939160	3945560	kotek so due to this meta is conducting a review and whether she violated the company's rules
3946600	3951480	the british tabloid mail online was pursuing is that the daily fail it must be it must be
3951480	3956280	the daily fails online the daily actually yeah the daily mail um yeah everybody calls it the
3956280	3962440	daily fail they're listed by by that name so the daily fail was working on a story
3962920	3969560	uh based on allegations from a former girlfriend of bobby kotex and a temporary restraining order
3969560	3976440	that she got against him but cheryl sandberg and kotek worked together in 2016 and 2019 according
3976440	3983800	to this report to strategize on how to persuade the daily mail to not report on the restraining
3983800	3990280	order facebook and activision staff were both directly involved with this and the concern at
3990280	3995560	facebook was that the story would quote reflect negatively on her reputation as an advocate for
3995560	4001400	women because remember she's dating him at the time wall street she's really an advocate for
4001400	4010280	women she wouldn't have been dating the shit yes i don't know what else to say uh the wall
4010280	4016280	street journal also openly questions if sandberg inappropriately used her influence as facebook
4016280	4024440	coo in dealing with mail online's management an unnamed source told that or said that kotek
4024440	4031080	quote told people that miss sandberg threatened the mail in 2016 by saying that such an article
4031320	4036360	published could damage the news organization's business relationship with facebook
4037880	4044760	why is the daily mail called the daily fail because of all their fucking clickbait headlines
4044760	4050120	and clickbait articles that they write on a regular basis who is the number one peddler
4050120	4057880	of those headlines but they do have a big readership oh sure people and people believe
4057960	4062120	stupid tabloids people especially if there's a grain of truth in it are you telling me dark
4062120	4067720	sakura here on this day on episode 911 of orange luxury are you telling me
4067720	4070440	that stupid people click stupid links are you telling me
4072760	4081000	my point is that if they have a concern about this affecting public opinion of the piece of shit
4081400	4087880	and her association with the piece of shit then it's a valid concern i mean they're both pieces
4087880	4094680	of shit but now more people will know how much shitty they are uh pele hanumea and chat says
4094680	4099720	bat boy marries princess diana that's the daily mail no that was weekly world news i'm almost
4099720	4107400	positive daily mail will post like legit stuff every so often what does it what does it say
4107400	4113160	what does it say about my sad brain that i knew which tabloid it was and to correct this
4113160	4121800	well-intentioned listener on their comment i have i will be taking no i have no further comment at
4121800	4129640	this time let's go back to uh uh this saga going on over here it should be pointed out the mail
4129640	4137240	online never published its story on kotak uh a meta spokesperson denied that sandberg threatened
4137240	4141560	uh mail online saying cheryl sandberg never threatened the mail online's business relationship
4141560	4146600	with facebook in order to influence an editorial decision this story attempts to make connections
4146600	4151240	that don't exist uh bobby kotak said to the journal he never said anything like that
4152920	4159160	activisions board of directors said it did a thorough investigation into an incident in 2014
4159240	4165640	and that they have full confidence in mr kotak's leadership holy shit is that a lot to unpack
4165640	4178120	right there because um i mean how many times has the activision board of directors come to say
4178120	4183000	we have confidence in bobby kotak we have confidence in what's going on here when
4183000	4187800	when honestly truly there is no reason to have that type of trust in bobby kotak
4189320	4196040	they did a thorough investigation in 2014 what can you detail for me activision what that
4196040	4201240	investigation was because it sounds like that investigation was throwing it a deep doc drawer
4201960	4203240	locking it and throwing away the key
4206360	4211640	if you would care to hear another quote boy do i have one for you the board has been aware of the
4211640	4217480	circumstances reporting involving an incident in 2014 around the time of the incident in 2014
4217480	4222760	mr kotak notified the senior independent director of the board has subsequently updated the full
4222760	4227720	board and has been fully transparent with the board the board through its council scadden arps
4228360	4232760	has done a thorough and what a name i'm probably mispronouncing it but do i really care at this
4232760	4237400	point has done a thorough examination of the facts and circumstances of the event satisfied
4237400	4241880	itself that there was no merit to the allegations and notes that they concern a personal relationship
4241880	4247160	that has nothing to do with the business of the company the board continues to have full confidence
4247160	4253640	in mr kotak's leadership and his ability to run the company i'm exhausted
4257320	4264040	anyway uh before we get to our next story i see the raid there from bromigos so i want to say
4264040	4269160	thank you thank you for that usually uh we're recording a podcast and so we sometimes are
4269160	4273080	really bad about doing the twitch things of acknowledging all the things when they happen
4273080	4276840	because our podcast listeners can't see that or any of that but i do want to say thank you thank
4276840	4282120	you for that it is appreciated and hope you guys are having a wonderful night um hi and welcome to
4282120	4288840	orange launch radio we've been doing this far too long uh if i had justice the scrolls on the bottom
4288840	4293880	our first episode was back in 2002 so i want to thank you all for being here for um our episode
4293880	4299320	tonight uh dark sakura and myself here loki with the night off as he had just had surgery earlier
4299320	4305400	this week and is recovering uh let's get into some more stories uh especially after that last story
4305400	4313720	about really it's it's honestly it's rich executives scratching each other on the back
4313720	4320760	literally and figuratively in this particular case and it just it's just exhausting to hear about
4321960	4328280	and why mr kotak is still employed in this industry i will never understand never understand
4330120	4334920	i i hope that once he's out the door that that's the last we hear of him
4335640	4340280	i hope that door gives him a swallow a solid thwack in the buttocks on his way out
4341320	4348280	all right let's i need happy news dark sakura make me happy make me happy only you can make
4348280	4357960	yourself happy rob is it the same anyway um sega is doing something cool they are uh doing reboots
4357960	4366040	of crazy taxi and just their radio and it's going to be big budget stuff too they are uh
4367240	4374440	the projects are part of something called super game initiative it's a plan that sega sammy has
4374440	4381720	had since last year so they wanted uh the the quote is um they want to develop all new and
4381720	4387160	innovative titles with a focus on global reach online interactivity community building and ip
4387160	4395240	utilization um and that's where the working with microsoft for the azure cloud platform comes in
4395800	4403720	so they want to uh use some of its dormant ip's for remakes remasters and reboots and by name
4403720	4409880	they said crazy taxi and jet set radio as candidates um other games on the list of space
4409880	4419640	channel 5 res panzer dragoon knight shinobi um virtue fighter and altered beast yes to literally
4419640	4426920	everything on this list literally everything crazy taxi and jet set radio were up on the top of the
4426920	4435320	list according to bloomberg um they have um done remasters remakes things for other dreamcast era
4435320	4441720	properties um crazy taxi and jet set radio were on the sega 2011 dreamcast collection
4442360	4450200	there were more i actually have crazy taxi for ipad which is actually not bad um uh there's also
4450200	4457400	uh crazy taxi ty tycoon which was originally called uh crazy taxi gazillionaire which is a
4457480	4464840	business management sim slash idol game um they've outsourced a lot of their ip revivals though
4464840	4471080	including streets of rage 4 panzer dragoon remake alex kid miracle world dx and house of the dead
4471080	4477880	remake to indie developers so we'll see what happens but right now sega is kind of riding
4477880	4487320	high on the the sonic revenue and um they're also looking into adapting uh yakuza and streets of
4487320	4494920	rage so we'll see how that goes i want a streets of rage music uh the movie if the soundtrack is
4494920	4501880	done by yuzo koshido well you may be in luck uh elsewhere in the industry this week apparently
4501880	4506600	this i i swear i read this somewhere the sonic director is interested in streets of rage
4507560	4514200	so but i knew about that yeah so but because i i actually brought that up two weeks ago oh okay uh
4514200	4519480	yuzo koshiro said somewhere that he wanted to be involved that doesn't mean his phone's ringing yet
4520520	4525720	yeah i hadn't seen anything about about that but i mean could you imagine if he did
4525720	4533640	like modern mixes of the original music that would be rad um in our chat they're talking
4533640	4539480	about like crazy taxi and these remixes um dark tetsuya says i saw someone on twitter
4539480	4545080	suggests a battle royale style take on crazy taxi and it sounds ridiculous enough to be fun
4545080	4551240	i actually think that would be awesome um like not necessarily 100 people but just even like that
4551240	4556680	sense of like 10 people all playing on the same map at the same time trying to pick up the same
4556680	4561240	people and get to the same spots i think that actually would be really funny that sounds really
4561240	4568600	funny it's only fun to me really i think it'd be fun i don't like i i i wouldn't like that i
4568600	4574200	like to get in and play it solo and be done it's it's always a solo game well it's not always be
4574200	4582120	as an option maybe i don't even i know but i when they when they put options in games like that
4582120	4590520	they have some sort of reward that forces you to play it and no um i also think um
4591240	4597960	crazy taxi is not crazy taxi uh unless it has that offspring song in it because only sometimes
4597960	4603080	they've been able to to get that you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like it's it's just not for
4603080	4613080	me it was more about the the um bad religion music i whenever 10 in 2010 came on that was my song
4614280	4618600	uh tiger cloud points out that whole soundtrack yeah sorry tiger points out it wasn't the sonic
4618600	4624200	director for streets of rage it was the writer for john wick my bad um the other one i wanted
4624200	4628600	to point out they were talking about panzer dragoon so quest buster says um as mike deaf
4628600	4634120	pointed out panzer dragoon had a remake unless they're talking about rebooting a new chapter
4634120	4640200	or the series which i'd love to see yeah i think that remake kind of had a soft land um it
4640200	4643800	definitely needed a patch to get to the place where it needed to be so i'm wondering if it
4643800	4649880	isn't maybe a new game or the reality is it's on the list but it's not at the top of the list
4649880	4654680	and you know at the top of the list they've already done that that third party remake yeah
4654680	4660840	as i mentioned so i i i would doubt very seriously i mean what i would actually like them to do
4661480	4668840	is if they did remake anything is if they did a remake of a panzer dragoon rpg or what was it
4668840	4677240	here panzer dragoon saga i think i i've got a copy somewhere all right um but that would be
4677240	4681800	nice because that game is is pretty amazing all right well let's talk about about what's excuse
4681800	4685160	me i have the hiccups you guys the worst thing that can happen to me when trying to do a show
4685160	4692360	um let's move on and talk about uh something that sega is doing which is sonic origins and we got
4692360	4698920	some new information on that this week so sonic origins uh is going to be coming to the the switch
4698920	4703320	but i believe it's coming to other platforms as well i just happen to be looking at a story on a
4703320	4710040	nintendo-based website um but it's a remastered collection of the original sonic the hedgehog
4710040	4716440	titles um so sonic did announce that the release date is june 23rd hey just in time for my birthday
4716440	4722440	and by the way it is the switch it's ps5 for xbox series and xbox one so it's you know most
4722440	4728840	of the normal areas you'd expect um sega's announced it's coming out on june 23rd and it's
4728840	4736760	going to be available in these different editions it's based basically standard digital deluxe and
4736760	4744680	three different dlcs with it which is uh yeah that's a lot it is a lot there's a start dash
4744680	4750840	pack uh with 100 bonus coins mirror mode already unlocked in a letterbox background there's a
4750840	4757560	premium fun pack with hard missions letterbox animations in the main menu and camera controls
4757560	4763320	in the main menu islands there is a classic music track with additional music tracks from
4763320	4769400	the mega drive and genesis titles so i i don't know if all this is really necessary um but okay
4769400	4774600	go off and honestly i'm gonna be honest when i first saw this trailer i was like
4775560	4782840	what these games have been released so many times they re-released rather so many times
4782840	4789320	you know we've had sonic one two and three and knuckles every more like since the playstation
4789320	4796520	3 xbox 360 there's been a sega collection that has had it in it i could swear sonic 3 has been in that
4796520	4802440	too but maybe maybe not the current like genesis emulation or whatever all right they're saying in
4802440	4808760	chat that sonic 3 has not been released in a long time i'll believe them that's fine but even then
4808760	4816680	it's you know just sonic 3 i guess sonic 1 and 2 of you'll come out a million times um some people
4816680	4821160	people also say it's because of the michael jackson involvement with the sonic 3 that that
4821160	4828680	one's kind of the the harder one to get re-done for whatever reason but it's not just and to be
4828680	4834280	fair it's not just that the games are re-releasing it's that they are done in the higher resolution
4834280	4839880	so it's you know crisp pixels i guess there is new opening and ending animations for each title
4839880	4845400	there are unlockables to get new content and special stages and then there's classic and
4845400	4851080	anniversary mode which basically the anniversary mode is a full screen so it uses wide screen
4851560	4856440	play the old games but in widescreen which is kind of interesting uh and as chat is pointing
4856440	4862440	out basically they're doing these games in the sonic mania engine which is interesting but i'm
4862440	4869880	not sure that dlc is a smart thing to do with this especially right out the gate to announce that all
4869880	4873880	this is there they probably should have released it and then trickled out the dlc probably would
4873880	4878760	have been a smarter way to do it but they really want to lock in those pre-orders that's for sure
4879400	4884120	so but i don't know i think i think they're asking a little much for it considering how many times
4884120	4889240	i've played played sonic the hedgehog in recent years but i do think that the widescreen mode
4889240	4898600	it's interesting but is it 30 interesting i don't know so all right well let's travel back and
4898600	4927880	revisit a classic game in our next segment and dark sakura what did you pick for the classic
4927960	4937960	game tonight i picked tetranet yeah we've talked about it many many a time a lot of us have
4937960	4945240	memories of it well i'm bringing it up now tetranet um and tetranet i apologize i need
4945240	4950120	to step away for just one minute to deal with the hiccups i'll be back sorry all right tetranet is
4950120	4960200	an online multiplayer version of tetris that supports up to six people and has team play so
4960200	4970280	it first came out in 1997 it had releases for microsoft windows unix mac os 10 and bayos
4971240	4980280	um it was developed by stormcat and the o is a zero because it was um the last official version
4980280	4986920	is version 1.13 and it was originally developed for windows and later ported to the other systems
4987880	4995720	stormcat also released tetranet 2 in 2000 that has improved graphics uh different types of special
4995720	5002600	blocks more types and additional features like a hold piece and block shadows and a master server
5003400	5011160	so um as far as um the game it basically is a standard multiplayer tetris with a twist
5011800	5018120	if you clear a row it will cause special blocks to appear in your field if a line containing a
5018120	5026120	special block is cleared then that block is added to your inventory clearing those lines at once
5026120	5031400	multiple lines at once increases the number of special blocks that you get so at any point you
5031400	5038360	can use a special block um at the at the start of your inventory on one of the six fields which is
5038360	5046200	one of your uh either your own or other people's uh or your opponents excuse me so it depends on
5046200	5052600	which type of block you're going to use so a is add a line where it adds a broken line
5052600	5059800	c is clear line which clears the line on the bottom of the field uh b is clear special blocks
5059800	5065880	which causes all special blocks to return to normal blocks r is random blocks clear so random
5065880	5071960	blocks are removed from the target field so that gives you gaps in your lines um o is a bomb block
5071960	5081320	which uh causes uh block bombs to explode and scatters uh other blocks throughout your play
5081320	5088600	field q is block quake which causes blocks on each line to shift and sort of like an earthquake
5088600	5095880	effect uh g is block gravity where the blocks on the field just immediately fall into whatever
5095880	5104600	gap happens to be there and deletes the completed line um s is to switch fields so you actually
5104600	5109640	switch your play field with somebody else and n is nuke field which removes all blocks from the
5109640	5115320	target field the last player to still be able to place pieces in their field is the winner
5115960	5120600	um and depending on the server use there are alternate rules sometimes there is pure
5120680	5125560	where special blocks are disabled so it's just everyone is playing multiplayer tetris
5126120	5133320	and then seven tetris where the first player to make seven seven tetrises is the winner so
5134120	5142120	there are those modes um the music in this one um it it's it's called the dance of the spheres
5142120	5148200	it's been everywhere like they made a step mania chart for this um what i don't remember that
5148200	5156520	that's awesome yeah um it's the authorship is claimed by someone named uh david is it might be
5158520	5164200	although there are other sources that say davy m carlson is the composer um
5165400	5171160	back in the day we thought this was hot shit today i can't stand listening to it i mean i i was like
5171160	5174520	okay jamming for a little bit a little bit nostalgia then after i was like okay i'm done
5175480	5183480	um so there are also um different variables you can add to the tetranet uh 1.13 client
5183480	5191720	different variables um one is called tetra tetra fast which removes the one second delay between
5191720	5199720	the pieces that you find and the standard tetranet gameplay um after uh when the police
5199960	5206360	sorry police piece delay is implemented on the client side it's just a modification that keeps
5206360	5214360	clients from from having it happen to the you know you basically there's you only connect
5214360	5221640	to people playing tetra fast um there's also uh one called tetranet slash tetra fast 1.14 with
5221640	5227880	the 1.14 protocol is a variant where everyone receives the same sequence of pieces there's
5227880	5234360	block tris um that's for the windows client um where it also supports the tetranet and tetra
5235000	5242120	fast protocols but it also has additional special block types one is for left gravity which pulls
5242120	5247800	the blocks to the left as far as possible piece change that changes your current piece and zebra
5247800	5257560	field which clears every second column on the field um then for tetranet 2 um it's another
5257560	5263800	multiplayer tetris done by the original creator um the five new blocks it adds is immunity where
5263800	5271000	the target cannot be affected by any special uh for 15 seconds clear column that deletes a column
5271000	5278840	from the field mutate pieces that causes um the target's next pieces a default of three to become
5278840	5284680	large and awkwardly shaped darkness where you can't see anything on the field beside your
5284680	5290040	current piece and its immediate surroundings for 10 seconds confusion that causes your controls to
5290040	5298200	get mixed up for 10 seconds um and then of course there were other other clone you know the other
5298200	5306360	uh tetranet 2 got closed down by the tetris company just like other ones did um the website
5306360	5312520	and servers were unavailable for several years as of early 2010 tetranet 2 is back up and running
5313320	5323000	uh and that's uh i kind of want to play yeah um the tetranet 2 website and servers have been
5323000	5333400	recovered relocated and restored um this the with all of the you know various versions it was really
5333400	5341320	well received especially by the linux community the uh linux conference uh linux.com.au um even
5341320	5347960	had a programming contest where they tried to uh program tetranet playing bots that would connect
5347960	5353240	to the server and play the game and the prize for best spot was forty thousand australian
5353240	5362040	uh was sorry a forty thousand australian dollar ibm p-series server and there's also land parties
5362040	5370840	um game revolution said tetranet was an affordable alternative to tetris and then in a review in 1999
5370840	5376280	of the next tetris game revolution said that tetranet was truer to the tetris roots and if
5376280	5381480	you want multiplayer a multiplayer tetris the network-based tetranet is more fun
5383560	5387160	i'm wondering if the existence of tetranet is what led to tetris 99
5388120	5394920	oh i'm i'm sure it's in part inspired by it for sure absolutely yeah you know when they were
5394920	5399080	trying to think of like how do we do tetris as a battle royale somebody probably thought of
5399080	5404840	tetranet you know and and you know how could we model it after that in some capacity oh for sure
5405480	5411800	for sure really care by the way for the way that tetranet 2.0 looks yeah i like the way the first
5411800	5422120	one looks better yeah but i like the overlaying grid over the pieces so for people who have like
5422120	5429160	some issues with uh the perception of space and i'm not saying next necessarily depth perception
5429160	5437560	but just more like spatial awareness having the the segments to the blocks make it easier
5437560	5443880	and more accessible well we didn't uh in chat they're talking about a vog tetris night and
5443880	5450040	def says uh tetris 99 has private lobbies you know uh a tetranet or a tetris 99 i think i'd actually
5450040	5455320	like super be down for that i think that would be a lot of fun uh i think we should invite kevin ddr
5455320	5460280	uh from who used to listen to olr years ago to just come and slaughter us all
5462760	5467640	so if you don't know he's he's uh was quite memorable in the tetra scene for a while so
5467640	5473720	i don't know if he still plays regularly but yeah that would be very funny all right all right well
5473720	5477080	there it is uh i think that's all you have to say right that's your classic game of the week
5477080	5482520	tetranet that'll do it that'll do it but that's that's such a good pick i love i love tetranet
5482520	5486600	and you're right it's come up on the show i don't know how many times before so uh it only makes
5486600	5492520	sense we spotlight it as a classic game of the week eventually around these parts right so all
5492520	5499640	right um anyhow let's wonder why okay my discord was taking forever to kick back in jamie was a
5499640	5505320	gray square for a minute there all right that's right um a lot a lot of ellos i have more stuff
5505320	5510840	to do in a row so i'll get right into it are we really okay oh yeah it's rapid fire news hey
5510840	5515960	when loki's not about to eat myself some rose jelly bellies okay when loki's not here we all
5515960	5520280	got to pick up the slack but these are rapid fire news so you can talk about them rapidly well i'll
5520280	5526840	let you chew that jelly bean and just mention in chat lol lol and dark tissue says idk how badly
5526840	5533080	do you want to lose um excellent question i'll probably lose anyway i'm not that good at tetris
5533720	5540040	um you know another tetris game that isn't played online enough is tetris effect it had a pretty
5540040	5543160	neat multiplayer mode in it i don't know how many of you actually have it we should do a
5543160	5549640	tetris effect night one night that would be fun i think so all right um i still like giant tetris
5549640	5556040	which one the giant oh isn't that a sega machine the arcade i think it is yeah that's fun all
5556040	5562680	right uh let's get anyway rapid fire news star sakura so um i'm sure we've we've covered this
5562680	5568520	before the tmnt uh shredder's revenge this retro style beat him up that you can play as the four
5568520	5574760	turtles or as april or s splinter well as long as as long as tiger claws here we'll always get

5581320	5588760	the 1987 tv series voice actors you know cam clark and all of them are revising their roles
5589320	5596360	that's legit pretty rad it is pretty rad and uh it doesn't have a release date yet um
5597240	5602120	it has a window dot emu the the publisher working with tribute games
5603240	5610440	confirms this summer for switch so it's gonna be pretty cool i've watched the trailer i'm pretty

5656600	5660120	also i i real quick before we get into our next segment some of you were talking about
5660120	5664120	that on our discord server this week and i always want to promote our discord server
5664120	5669400	vog network.com that's vognetwork.com discord we'll get you an invite to the server and many
5669400	5673240	of you post stories there throughout the week and sometimes we pull from that uh for stories
5673240	5676520	that we're going to talk about on the show and i'm i'm always happy somebody sometimes people
5676520	5681400	ask me my opinion on things throughout the week i'm if i'm surprised people care but i'm surprised
5681400	5686680	or i'm always uh happy to drop my opinion on whatever you just tagged me over on our discord
5686680	5691640	server so um dart to see us says i never got around to that one officially i'm assuming that's
5691640	5696280	the battle toads and double dragon game but playing a bit of the rom it seemed kind of fun
5696920	5701880	yeah all right uh we are now going always annoyed the shit out of me so i'm not buying it
5702840	5706840	all right we are going to travel around the world and check out some release dates um

5755000	5759960	out there cricket 22 is coming out on the nintendo switch but i'm just i'm just gonna guess
5759960	5764680	i don't it's listed in my american release dates although i can't imagine it's actually coming out
5764680	5769640	in america but that's that's awesome if it does there's a somewhat cricket falling in the us

5798680	5807320	our next show nintendo switch sports that is we sports but nintendo switch sports um and that's
5807320	5811400	uh one that we've had on our our ion for a little bit ever since nintendo kind of surprised announced

5883240	5889480	of nobunaga oda by saving him from death so you must survive three months surrounded by famous
5889480	5893800	and handsome sengoku warlords before your next chance to make it back home
5896360	5902760	this game sounds too ridiculous to be true but it's true but it's but it's it's notable because
5902760	5910760	it's you're it's like a men dating simulator you're dating uh sengoku so um that's kind of fun

6023880	6028440	get to the listener round table your emails your calls and all that good stuff if you want to join
6028440	6035960	us in our discord for a call vog network.com discord by the way i i have a special need tonight
6035960	6041160	i'm hoping somebody will call in because i'm gonna need help wrapping up the show tonight
6041720	6045640	because dark sakura as you know she tends to go out the door before the credits roll because
6045640	6050200	she's trying to set up for her own little thing uh going on after the show the after party
6050200	6057960	that's going to leave me here all by my lonesome self so what you're what was you saying i was
6057960	6063720	singing that song all by myself by myself yeah so that will leave me all by myself if nobody
6063720	6068280	calls in tonight but if we get a phone call tonight i can let that person close down the
6068280	6075480	show with me tonight so that'll be fun all right um but first intern yeah an intern tonight so
6075480	6080440	let's uh we do have some stories to get to before we get to the listener round table so let's get to
6080440	6090920	this uh first story from dark sakura so um uh wisconsin video game workers uh at raven software
6090920	6095880	um as we know they are the arm of activision blizzard that works on call of duty
6096520	6105080	um they and i believe that we've talked about raven before in this uh in this whole uh concept
6105080	6110360	here but they have a unionization campaign by 21 of their employees in middleton wisconsin
6111000	6116920	um as just trying to shake more of this up going on i mean they're working you know to really put
6116920	6126280	it in there um but at this point um their regional uh nlrb director in minneapolis rejected
6126920	6134040	um activision's push to have the election encompass a wider category of raven workers
6134040	6143880	that would dilute the unionizing vote so um at this point um it looks like that the union
6143880	6145480	the unionizing may be good to go
6147880	6154280	so you know we we hypothesize this would probably start at activision and this would be one of the
6154280	6159160	first to uh break the dam so to speak on the unionization in the game industry efforts and
6159160	6163480	that might be uh coming to i mean we it's not the first time we've heard of the uni because we've
6163480	6167800	had stories on the show weeks before there's been other smaller developers but for this to happen
6167800	6174840	within activision would be something another thing too earlier this month um activision
6174840	6179480	blizzard also announced that they would be converting nearly 1100 part-time quality
6179480	6186440	assurance jobs to full-time jobs and raising hourly wages to at least 20 bucks so there's that
6187640	6192440	all right and uh if you've gotten if you're getting a raise at your job and you want to
6192440	6198280	waste your money on something uh boy do i have the prospect for you and that is more legos because
6199160	6207480	an official lego atari 2600 is supposed to be launching this august um this is by promo bricks
6207480	6213640	who kind of leaked this i guess um because uh this you know these things tend to leak out in catalogs
6213640	6220200	and um you know uh industry ordering and things like that um so an official lego version of the
6220200	6226920	2600 console uh will be coming back coming out in august as part of the 50th anniversary for
6226920	6233880	atari as a company uh the set will have a lego rendition of the console itself and also the
6233880	6240360	joystick and a cartridge of pitfall which is interesting because that's not an atari game that
6240360	6245080	was an activision game but that will be the game that will be made from plastic bricks of course
6245080	6251480	very very similar to the nes system that's out there that you can make a little mario on the tv
6251480	6257080	that runs it's super cute i don't have one because i was able to hold on to my money but i've seen it
6257080	6262280	i think bobby blackwolf had one at his house and i was looking at it it's cute um and uh yeah it's
6262280	6268840	a cute little system so uh that'll uh if the atari 2600 one has the tv and everything too that would
6268840	6277800	be pretty cool so uh promo bricks is saying that the atari 2600 will be 200 i'm sorry 199.99 but
6277800	6284360	let's just say 200 uh when it is a timed exclusive on lego's website this august and a general retail
6284360	6292200	release in january of 2023 dark to see it says well i guess it would be either that et or pac-man
6292760	6296120	uh i think atari wants to forget those two
6298440	6304200	so it's probably yeah combat would have probably been the game for that oh hey loki's in chat
6304200	6309560	shouldn't you be lucky shouldn't you be resting loki all right i knew he wouldn't be able to stay
6309560	6315720	away all night but i was actually gonna say tune in next week to find out when loki plans to get
6315720	6320920	his because i'm sure he's gonna get uh his own version of that but um i would also expect so so
6320920	6327080	i also saw in chat uh they're saying that seems kind of cheap it says nothing about the operational
6327080	6332840	tv with the game on it we know there's a pitfall cartridge that doesn't mean there's a pitfall game
6332840	6338280	on the tv so i would imagine that piece of it probably actually isn't there um unless they you
6338280	6345000	know unless again we're hearing this uh from a second-hand source i imagine when uh atari or
6345000	6349240	excuse me lego and atari decide to officially unveil it we'll find out for sure but i wouldn't
6349240	6355400	count on the tv being a part of it so all right that is it believe it or not for the stories that
6355400	6359560	we had on deck for tonight so we're going to get into the listener round table we'll take your
6359560	6367400	questions uh over at twitch.tv slash vog network but also we welcome your emails every week
6367400	6372200	participate at orange lounge radio.com and as i mentioned earlier we will take your calls on the
6372200	6379000	discord vognetwork.com slash discord i believe we have one email tonight so i will turn it
6379000	6385080	over emails oh same person snap or i may have not thrown out last week's email check the date
6386120	6390680	um you know i'm notoriously bad at that yeah yeah sorry last week that was last week's you know i
6390680	6399480	rely on a clean inbox you are more than welcome to log in before sunday night to take a take a peek
6399480	6405960	all right let's get to tonight's email hello lr i was not expecting the reaction that i got
6405960	6411320	to my email last week ha as always thank you for your support of my games and i'm including
6411320	6418440	the listeners in that as well rob mentioned that unlike with xbox live indie games falling plus is
6419160	6426040	displayed on the proper xbox store unfortunately this isn't 100 true because although you can
6426040	6431720	search for it and find it easily you cannot browse the store for it games included in the
6431720	6437080	creators collection as it is called cannot be browsed you may recall that the store got a
6437080	6443240	complete visual overhaul back in 2020 this collection had a browsable section on the store
6443240	6448680	before that but now that is gone several folks have opened tickets or made complaints about this
6448680	6454520	but unfortunately microsoft is not acknowledging or responding to these oh well i will also mention
6454520	6460280	that falling plus is unfortunately not a play anywhere title meaning you cannot also play it
6460280	6467080	on windows but if um if you buy it on xbox to anyone who would have utilized this i apologize
6467080	6471080	but it's already available on steam and my audience is small enough that i didn't want
6471080	6477560	to split it across the two different pc versions but if you post a score to leaderboards on xbox
6477560	6484280	email me at yyr at yyrgames.com with your xbox gamer tag and they'll send you a free steam key
6484840	6489400	that's good guy yyr he doesn't have to do that at all but that's just good guy yyr
6490760	6495880	i'll end with a quick correction forza horizon 4 is actually still available on xbox game pass
6496440	6502120	so if you just discovered forza horizon with the fifth game but would like to try the same game on
6502120	6508040	a different map then give it a try while you can i happen to really like the version of the uk that
6508040	6512920	they created thanks again for the show and have a great week looking forward to seeing peppy the
6512920	6520440	penguin again erin yyr all right i'm i'm so glad uh you're happy with the reaction because i was
6520440	6525880	happy to see it and that's a bummer that there isn't like a store like a way to like look it
6525880	6530600	up in the store by hand you know a store page kind of like you were explaining there i just assumed
6530600	6535800	because i could search for it and it had like you you were in the template in the store like you had
6535800	6540760	screenshots you had all that other stuff i just kind of assumed oh okay it's in the store because
6540760	6546360	here it all is but you have to search for it that's interesting um ssj100 matt also notes uh
6546360	6550520	you can link directly to it because he just dropped the link in our chat room so you can
6550520	6555720	actually just tap the link and buy it there that way if you want um it's it's too long of a link
6555720	6561240	for me to read on air so i can't really do it that way um but i can just say search for falling plus
6561240	6568040	or you can probably search for yyr uh and you'll find it that way too but if for whatever reason
6568040	6572120	that doesn't work dude just do falling plus and you'll find the game i did play it earlier this
6572120	6579720	week but i i didn't i was playing for so long i got to a point i had to leave i had to leave and
6579720	6584920	i couldn't finish the game and upload my high score i should have just purposely died a bunch
6584920	6588680	of times to get my high score up there but i'll do that i'll do that later this week maybe i'll do
6588680	6595400	a stream who knows but kudos again yyr for the release of falling plus and um my bad on forest
6595400	6600120	horizon four i guess it was three they must have delisted not that long ago i'm just getting lost
6600120	6606440	amongst all those numbers can you blame me i'm not sure all right thank you dark soccer for that
6606440	6611800	email reading uh participate at orange launch radio.com if you would like to send an email for
6611800	6617880	a future week in the meantime let's welcome a special guest onto the show because i see
6617880	6622120	someone in our green room so hello you are you are on orange launch radio who's this
6623640	6632200	hey what's going on everyone it is ron well long time no talk i know right you know i had no i
6632200	6641480	wasn't planning on calling in until that first article popped up i'm like yeah which article
6642520	6647800	oh about about about the person working at nintendo that's oh basically mad they didn't
6647800	6654920	get flipped to full-time employment what's your thoughts on that well i've been in it
6654920	6662760	basically 20 something oh yeah it and contractors oh yes yes and the bulk of that has basically has
6662760	6670680	been me as a contractor and the main reason you want to go fte is for the benefits and the
6670680	6676360	discounts and all that cool stuff that's the main reason why but sometimes you'll have to
6676360	6684120	be there anywhere from like three days to five years until a position opens up that you can get
6684120	6691400	in there or if the budget is big enough where oh they could add another spot for you and that's
6692360	6697400	it and contracting specifically is a very interesting world because you get a lot of
6697400	6702120	temporary people that are brought in for transition work like we're moving from one
6702120	6707160	cloud to another so we're going to hire contractors that are experts in this to help us with this
6707160	6711000	transition and then we're going to let them go because they're only they're literally contractors
6711000	6716040	they're here for this length of time it does a lot of stuff like that that i i would say is
6716040	6722040	nefarious but it's oh it stinks and i'm sure i'm sure nefarious shit happens don't don't get me
6722040	6729880	wrong yeah it basically depends on the company now i i will put this out there you know i
6729880	6738200	was a contractor with nbc universal for about a year until covid happened now we had two separate
6738200	6743480	it departments they merged them so the next open spot went to somebody in the other department
6743480	6748920	because he had seniority over me and the main reason why i was putting my head down doing what
6748920	6754200	i had to do is because i wanted those discounted tickets to universal studios and for the record
6754200	6758280	i was going to universal studios japan so that was that was my main goal you got to see you
6758280	6762680	got to see super mario world i don't blame you at all yeah that well yeah that and the sailor moon
6762680	6768600	4d uh experience oh shit that's a thing oh my god i want to see i want to take alan alan loves
6768600	6774520	yeah yeah i i will find you information and i'll send it to you do you know how many bootleg vhs
6774520	6782680	sailor moon tapes alan has in his closet i know i had over 150 bootleg vhs tapes until i had to
6782680	6788520	toss them when i moved believe you me and when i switched to digital a couple terabytes of fan
6788520	6795880	subs which i slowly deleted as i went to purchase legal titles and stuff like that but i've worked
6795880	6801720	for a company called fresh direct where i was a contractor there and i ended up long term because
6801720	6807800	i knew how to run help desk and do technical support besides loading windows or mac onto
6807800	6813080	a computer and handing it to the user and what they did was they had a contracting division
6813080	6818280	for those for union for the truckers you were contracting with them for x amount of weeks
6818280	6824680	till you got flipped over to the union where you had all the benefits and so forth and one thing
6824680	6830600	that some people don't realize is that when the company when the agency pays you x amount they
6830600	6836360	charge that company double the amount to have you there which is why nine times out of ten you'll be
6836360	6843320	at that same rate for more than one or two years because they'll be like oh we don't have that type
6843320	6849720	of money because it's coming out of their bonus and that's why you work hard to show it you can
6849720	6855320	do so that the manager of this company be like you know what this person's good i like them
6855320	6863080	let's convert them you know and right now the company i'm currently working with
6863640	6870760	i got the call about a month ago saying that my contract is getting converted so i'm basically
6870760	6876440	waiting for the hr paperwork and so forth so in a way i do understand where this person is coming
6876440	6884120	from but sometimes you you've got to you always got to watch your back because even though you
6884120	6891000	are still an employee of the company you got to follow the rules and so forth the littlest stuff
6892520	6898520	they will ping you for and what's interesting in some cases the littlest stuff they don't they
6898520	6903480	just let that slide and they expect everybody else to set the proper example you know
6905240	6911080	it's uh the contracting world is very interesting stuff and it's it's it's far beyond video games as
6911080	6916920	well but it's interesting to see um how video games kind of play into that and how the industry
6916920	6922920	you know really uses contractors to do um a lot of work that we don't always think about that goes
6922920	6928520	into making games i mean it's not even sorry it's not even just like the testing of games and these
6928520	6934520	are that but like we've talked about trade shows packs right now i don't know what big names are
6934520	6940440	still doing packs east right now um but you know when it was you know nintendo and sony that were
6940440	6946440	doing these shows the booths that were the people that were staffing the boost contractors yeah
6947320	6954360	booth babes i'm using my quotey fingers at e3 in the pat contractors yeah so i mean
6956280	6962920	and wait this happens at regular anime conventions too it's like you can be you go to a con and be
6962920	6968440	like you can work a booth and get for 20 hours and get reimbursed for your badge and you still
6968440	6972440	get to go enjoy something like that that happens yeah and the thing is it's like
6974040	6981560	like nintendo can sit there and curate all these resumes and go through the whole kit and caboodle
6981560	6988840	of the multi-tier interviews to see if they want you or not they'll let the third party company
6988840	6994120	be like you know what we're gonna call all these people in they're gonna put them through those
6994120	6998600	interviews it used to be where the agency will call you back we got your position you report
6998600	7004360	here now it's like we have your position you're gonna interview with the agency to see if you are
7004360	7010520	fit and if they like you you're going to interview with the company and so on and so forth that way
7010520	7015080	in the event you do get converted to full-time you've already done those interviews all you
7015080	7021640	gotta do is sign the paperwork and that's that um speaking of conventions i know you were somewhere
7021640	7026200	this weekend because you sent me a picture with another blast from olr's past where were you at
7026200	7033480	this weekend i was actually in the bronx i went to go visit j j vmont at his job oh you were at
7033480	7038680	the store oh i thought you were at a convention okay you were in the actual store oh okay no i'm
7038680	7043960	i have a convention this weekend i'm still catching up from the last con uh i i pre-ordered
7043960	7051560	a pop from his store because you know even though that same pot was available at game stop i decided
7051560	7056440	to cancel that pre-order in order from his comic book shop to support small independent shops good
7056440	7062920	for you especially especially his our old friend there so even if i haven't seen him in a while he
7062920	7067080	used to call her right once in a while but i i know business has been very busy so i forget
7067880	7072200	i went there to pick up a pop and he walked and he he walked away with a hundred extra dollars
7072200	7081320	of my money i bought comic book boxes and more pops okay aka shit you don't need you still
7081400	7089560	walked out of there with it hey look today today was our weekly cost or no actually more
7089560	7095480	our every three weeks or so costco trip i have no room to talk about buying extra shit you don't need
7097880	7104920	look behind my head is a mini is a makeshift shelf that sits on my storage bins of all the
7104920	7111080	figurines i have purchased that i have not taken out because i realized i don't have room for them
7111080	7118600	in the display case but they're great deals at cons and it's like well it's within the seven
7118600	7125880	to ten dollar amazon let me buy this you know i love it uh yeah i'll be filling up this place
7125880	7132440	soon enough with that same stuff so yeah i'll say as much about one thing about contracting that i've
7132440	7140120	gained from is the fact that every place i've worked at is same yet different i've gained a
7140120	7147240	lot of valuable knowledge and training and skill but what sucks is when you're trying to go full
7147240	7152840	time somewhere they look at your resume and see all these places and it's like well how come you
7152840	7159000	haven't stayed here how come you're like my contract ended that was it that's all it was
7159000	7164840	yeah i was up for a role i didn't get it because i had too many contracting positions and in a way
7164840	7169000	i'm kind of glad i didn't get that role because i'm happier where i am now that's a weird thing
7169000	7176280	to dq someone over for sure the person believes that when you're in it you shouldn't have all
7176280	7183800	these multiple positions these roles i i know multiple people in it where that's the norm
7183800	7187960	couldn't you just list your role as the contractor company and the whole time you've been there or
7187960	7191320	are you going back and forth between different contractor companies just because i know when
7191320	7196040	i was like that by the way well when i was doing contract stuff i was signed up with like three of
7196040	7199800	them and i'm like whichever of you hose gets me a job burst is the one i'm sticking with
7200600	7207080	i i do that that's exactly what it is yeah i sent my my my resume out next thing you know i'm
7207080	7214120	getting all these texts emails and phone calls you know yeah it's for sure i will put it this
7214120	7222280	way though when i started with where i am i um i started there with the intention that they would
7222280	7227560	hire me because that's just how it works if you really suck you don't you don't stay on
7228200	7232920	and i had my first interview for a completely different department and where i work they
7232920	7238360	encourage you to wear different hats and diversify yourself and build a bigger portfolio and learn
7238360	7244360	more and incorporate that into newer and newer newer roles so i know that where i work is also
7244360	7250280	a unicorn uh rama i want to get your reaction to this quote in our chat over at twitch.tv
7250520	7255080	network quest buster says a co-worker once told me that you can't spell shit without it
7258760	7264280	look there is a reason why there is a flask on my desk
7269080	7271960	it's regularly have a gimlet lunch break
7274920	7279880	i i'm glad that they care lunch for us every single day and i'm glad of the fact that the
7280360	7287720	one block over sells beer okay i love it all right well uh hey rama why don't you hang out

7403160	7405560	as well do you have a final thought you'd like to share with listeners tonight
7405560	7412920	drink more sparkling water because this cherry limeade is the bomb that i i've had that
7412920	7420840	particular brand and it is good it's good stuff there's like nine cases sitting over here so i'm
7420840	7425720	like i'm good for the next like three months i'm not the only one that stocked up at costco clearly
7425720	7432040	so all right anyway uh my final thought tonight is you know what i need costco to carry and i've
7432040	7435560	already talked about this on a previous episode of the show is this fucking quote coke starlight
7435560	7441800	shit that's a zero it's so good i think so some people some people think it tastes like ass i
7441800	7449560	think it's delicious and uh it was tasty i kind of felt a taste a hint of caramel while i was
7449560	7453720	drinking i'm like it's lighter than normal coke this is good it tastes like raspberry to me it
7453720	7457640	tastes like specifically this black and red raspberry gummies that's what this tastes like
7457640	7462440	to me some people say cotton candy ah yes i don't know and apparently there's a new uh they're doing
7462440	7466600	something like pixels i think is you know here i am giving coke free ad dollars but you know what
7467400	7473720	here's the downside because i like this because i like this i drew this i'm already not able to
7473720	7479400	find the 12 packs anymore and it's just i know it's going to disappear shit i love always goes
