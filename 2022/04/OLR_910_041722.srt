00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Start your night now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello, my friends. Out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 910 of our show for tonight, April the 17th of 2022.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My name is Rob Roberts and not joining me tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You might have heard last week she is taking this week off for her birthday.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So a happy birthday to DarkSakura even though it's actually in a couple days, but we'll still say it a little early.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Happy birthday DarkSakura who is currently on vacation in Southern California.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I think she gets to go to Disneyland and I'm not jealous or anything.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Not at Disneyland with me. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, I'm not at Disneyland.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No, you're not at Disneyland.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But you're in Star Wars something something in the game playing behind you tonight here on Twitch.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's the Lego Star Wars Skywalker saga.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It is.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Like a Lego game which I still haven't gotten.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I've never actually played the Lego Star Wars games.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There's always the Lego Marvel and mainly the Lego Marvel stuff.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why is that, Loki? Why are you hating?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't hate. It's just there's a lot of games and a lot of that stuff came out a long time ago before I started playing like the Lego games.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This one though is worth picking up though because it's everything.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So I probably will end up doing that.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sounds good.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And I hear the combat's really good.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We do tape live of course every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And our live chat always helps us get along through the show.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
For example, SJ100Matt is saying, this is the broccoli farm.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's no Disneyland here.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Checking an old OLR joke, a pre-pandemic OLR joke when Loki told his kids they were going to the broccoli farm and then they actually went to Disneyland.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't remember why you were lying to your kids, but you were.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't remember why because we want them to be surprised.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And they were very convinced that they were going to a broccoli farm.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Until we got like we got to the apartment that we were staying at and they were still convinced that they're going to a broccoli farm.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And then we're like, do you know where we are?

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And they're like, no.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And like the house is like decorated and Disney stuff is like, well, where do you think we're really going?

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Literally the batter horn is sticking out and the Disney fireworks are going off outside the window.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The Disney fireworks went off shortly afterwards.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Like if we had gotten there a little bit later, you know.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What?

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's the broccoli fireworks.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
PodCulture in chat says, this is why there's a stock of broccoli in the show art.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That is true.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
DarkSakura hit a lot of little site gags that are like show in gags in the art for the podcast.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And there is a stock of broccoli in there.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And it is a direct reference to Loki lying to his kids about the broccoli farm.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Was there any disappointment that there wasn't broccoli?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Because I'll say I'm one of those weirdos where I actually really like broccoli, especially with all the lifestyle changes I've made in the last six months or I've been losing weight and stuff.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You know, I will.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Maybe I'll eat a burger if I go to like, I don't know, Chili's or whatever, like chain restaurant.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll get a burger.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll still have that.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But instead of getting fries, I'll get a side of broccoli.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And I'm actually like kind of OK with that.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I mean, they're they're not fries, but they were disappointed.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But they were like they they were upset at first.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They're like, no, really?

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We're really going to a broccoli farm.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why would you do that?

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now, if you took me to a Brussels sprouts farm, I'd be pissed off, but why Brussels sprouts are amazing.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I only like them prepared like one way, and I'm sure it's the fattiest, most unhealthy way you can make them.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And then you put bacon all over it.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And that's the only way I eat Brussels sprouts.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, so basically how I make them.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah, you just it defeats the purpose.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Loki, it defeats me.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
First, you take you take basically a whole package of bacon.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You cook it down and then you throw some olive oil on some Brussels sprouts, bake them,

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and then you cook some onions and you toss it all together and pour a bunch of heavy cream over it and cheese.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And that's keto friendly.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It is. It is keto friendly.

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm not technically on keto, but I'm like keto adjacent.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm low carb.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So, yeah, it's those types of stuff really work for me.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So, yeah.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Anyway, also happy Easter to those that celebrate.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But you can see I'm not doing anything tonight.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Loki's not doing anything tonight.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Did you do anything during the day?

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Do you hide eggs for the kids or are we past that point?

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, we're past that.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They did eggs at my my youngest son's school.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
OK, sort of.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And he didn't really care.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They got like a gift from the grandma like earlier in the week.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, I got to a certain point where I was just like, just give me a box of Peeps and some chocolate and I'll show.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And yes, I do like Peeps.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And you can take those memes.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How many times have I seen that meme posted my Facebook wall where it's like the only good way to eat Peeps and it's somebody throwing him in the trash?

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've seen that meme like 50 different ways.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why don't you try the only way to write an original meme?

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Because that ain't it, y'all.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So anyway, I like we went to we went to Funderland on Friday because they had both kids had Friday off, so I took it off as well.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So they went to Funderland, which is like a little teeny amusement park that's local that they have like carnival rides, I guess, you know, none of which are built for adults.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can tell you that much, because I tried going on all this stuff and like it's so uncomfortable.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's so so uncomfortable.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Like they had the teacup ride there and stuff, which is fine.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And I made my kids almost sick.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But it was just like, like I was just like scrunched in there.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Like there's no room for like two kids and a parent.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And then they had like this other one that was like this stagecoach ride that goes really fast.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's like the revolution down in the beach boardwalk.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But like, it's just my son was getting squished against me and I was getting pushed against the restraint bar that they had.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It was just it was not fun.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's not fun at all.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Play me a golf afterwards.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So that was fun.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The stream and chat says I'm eating coffee flavored peeps as we speak.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That sounds obviously I don't eat peeps anymore.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If you've been following the show, you know why.

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But that sounds amazing.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I used to love the birthday cake ones.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Those are my favorite.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Bobby Blackwell says going to send Rob all the last week tonight segments on peeps.

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, I'm going to send you the the clip from Billy on the street that asked, do gays care about John Oliver?

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's really funny.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Like none of them know who he is, even though John Oliver standing right there.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And then like you'll ask one of them, like, do you do you know, do you care about John Oliver?

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
They're like, no, who's that?

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Do you care about Wendy Williams?

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, yeah, she's fierce.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's great.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Look up that clip.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Somebody find me that clip and give it to Bobby.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's Billy on the street.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Anyway.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
All right.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We got to get into some actual video game news.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We're not just here to talk about pop culture.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It just happens.

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We're going to talk about video game news and what the future of gaming might look like.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, it's not necessarily the future full of NFTs and ads.

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Right, Loki?

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, it's it's not full of it.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, I mean, they're trying with the NFT stuff.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So ads, I guess.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So there's a big deal, I guess, over this.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Tech that's being developed by Microsoft, I guess, but ads in games, like, does that really need to be developed?

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because I'm pretty sure that we've had ads in games for like the last couple of decades already.

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Like, is this really new stuff?

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Maybe not a couple of decades, but.

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You know, we're almost two decades into ads in games.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Is that really new tech?

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And we were really surprised by this.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I mean, I can remember like there being ads for the Scion in Crackdown, like, you know, it's a futuristic game and we're advertising the Scion.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Like, why?

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Or maybe it's the Yaris.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But there was Yaris too.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hey, there's some games that are just all ads.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There's a chuck wagon, Purina chuck wagon on the Atari 2600 that caused the video game crash much more than ET did.

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But I digress.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, there's also like there's examples of like Advanced Warfighter two and stuff like that called it a game that has ads in it.

155
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm pretty sure there's been lots of games where they have art assets like billboards and stuff like that, where there's an ad inside of it.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I mean.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're you're going to hear people complaining about it because I know, like, especially with like Madden, where people feel like they're kind of ripped off in the game in the first place.

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And they have like full like actual video advertisements and commercials in there because it's more authentic, you know, to the viewing experience or something like that.

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But really, it's just another cash grab.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let me let me get into some comments from chat because chat is wanting to tell you why you're wrong, which they are want to do.

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So let me get into this.

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So Bobby Blackwell in chat says it's more the delivery network of having new ads and already released game and the profit sharing.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're talking about ads baked into games.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is literally about new ads being injected into already released games.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And that's true.

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And Matt says it's not new tech at all.

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The delivery system is what's different.

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Also, Microsoft willing to share the revenue from said ads with the devs for the free to play games.

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I actually you know what?

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I completely understand that, you know, technically this article and why it's coming up is about everything that's chat pointing out.

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I could still look at all that and say, I kind of feel like Loki has a point.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why is this everywhere this week?

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You know, it is the show where, you know, gamers have a voice and what gamers are talking about.

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And people are talking about this article this week.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And even I had that reaction.

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I mean, I realize it's about, you know, trying to buffer.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And I think I think also what I really think it is, it's a way to help Microsoft make additional money off of Game Pass.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But I'll get into that because I know those games are not technically free, but I'll get into that later.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, it's if they want to have like a methodology, like they could basically say, hey, you know, existing developers, if you want to put ads into your games, you can a little bit easier, like kind of a API to do that or framework to do that.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's fine.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But I was going to say, but I was saying, Loki, I think to your point and to your credit, your reaction to this whole thing is like we've been getting ads for forever.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We've been conditioned to this for a while.

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Like, it's weird that this conversation is such a big deal.

184
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't have a problem with them putting at like a billboard or something in a game, as long as it's not immersion breaking, putting ads in games.

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If it's if it's really, you know, there's different levels of advertising in game, right?

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There's like, you know, more immersive ways of doing it, like maybe in a sports game or something like that where you have like billboards in the background that have sponsors or advertisers there.

187
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then there's what Capcom did with the Street Fighter stuff where they plaster brands all over like the characters.

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And then there's also, you know, possible ways that are immersion breaking where we have stuff that's just in these games.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I mean, are we talking about like, it depends on how they implement it.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And if there is a variety of ways they can implement it, people are going to express their dislike of it if it's really obtrusive.

191
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So is that like, like happened with Street Fighter five, when they had those ads before the match that would be like this match is brought to you by the Street Fighter tournament.

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You know, and it's a lot of in house stuff, too, which was really odd.

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So yeah, that stuff was a little weird.

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But it's a weird thing where I think we're kind of looking at this announcement about okay, yeah, great.

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They're looking at how to get the ads and the already existing games.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
They're looking at having some of the profit sharing to encourage more people to make free games for Xbox.

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay, okay. Yeah, I get all that.

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But it's, it's kind of about like, because it's free games, and these are free games we're talking about, I don't think too many of us take issues with it right now.

199
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Like we expect that nothing in this world is completely free, and that there's probably going to be some ads in free games.

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And if there are more immersive type of ads that don't interrupt the game, then that's actually a good thing, I think.

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, but you know, they're not going to put it in free games.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They, you know, sure, it would be probably accepted in free games.

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But you know that these developers that are these publishers that are looking to put this stuff in there, they're going to put it in paid games.

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Well, that's where people have a problem with.

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And to my next point, I think and again, I have I have nothing to base this off of there is nothing rooted in fact about this next statement.

206
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm completely willing to admit that.

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
However, sometimes we like to make bold predictions here on OLR.

208
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And mine is that it is that Microsoft is probably going to start using this in some game pass related games as well.

209
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And you might be thinking, wait a minute, I already pay a sub for game pass, why would I start getting ads in games?

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, number one, if they're not that intrusive, and they're being designed this way, so that they are on incidental billboards, and they're in sports games, and all this stuff.

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Is it going to be that big of a deal?

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I think also is that, you know, another story that's going around on the blogs and stuff this week is that game pass can only really substantiate this model without increasing their price for so long, that either a price increase is going to come, or Microsoft has to look to offset some of the losses and so forth in other ways.

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I think maybe subtle advertising in some of their games could be a way to do that.

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Again, I am making that up, but I could absolutely see and I think you'd be remiss not to say you could also see how they get from this point to it being a part of game pass in the future as well.

215
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Now, my question is, would that piss you off?

216
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
If the ads were subtle, and they're billboards, sports arena things, and that's what advertising and game pass games piss you off?

217
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It could if if if they're still going to be putting advertisements everywhere. So not necessarily just in games, but in the menus in in the actual Xbox, like marketplace.

218
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Because right now, like for example, with like windows and stuff, you can get these different ad tiles or whatever in there will advertise different features.

219
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They're talking about adding ads to windows for different things. So if they start plastering ads in the console UI, you know, if they put it in the games all over the place, if it's really obtrusive, then yeah, I'll be a little bit angry at it.

220
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But most of the time, unfortunately, right now, I'm not really playing anything on my Xbox. So it doesn't really make a difference.

221
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I was gonna say, I don't know if you're reading what's currently hot, but like, or you're making a commentary on what's currently happening, but like, there's already ads on the Xbox UI.

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Right? Yeah, I understand that. Okay, we're taking like, if you're putting it there, other places like, well, listen, I've already paid, you know, I'm paying for these games, you know, I understand the games pass, whatever, you know, they're charging, whatever it is, but technically, you're paying for something.

223
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And even if you bought a game, like an actual physical release, you know, it'd be kind of annoying that, like later on, we're patching in advertisements into my game that I already paid for. Like, I get it that you have to maintain servers or whatever the case may be. But it's just it seems like it's another cash grab.

224
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I mean, that's what it is. They're trying to make additional revenue for stuff. But like, who's to say you have to have like, these huge budget games like to be profitable? I mean, there are other ways to be profitable with these games without having to just shove ads everywhere. But it right now, this is all speculation, because we don't know how they're going to implement it. And I'm pretty sure they're not gonna do it a way to piss off everybody. So we'll just have to wait and see what happens. Yeah.

225
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Um, now bonds double six and chat says if the ads break the game flow completely stop what you're doing just a TV commercial break just as the killer identity was to be revealed. Well, you know what you make me think about is one of my top pet peeves on Twitch. And I'm sorry, because this might apply to some of you that are watching, but I'm gonna as a friend, I'm going to tell you that that shirt is ugly on you. And this is what I'm going to tell you.

226
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If you're running those Twitch ads that run every 20 to 30 minutes, like just in the middle of somebody watching your stream, nothing will get me to stop watching your stream faster. Because those things are always timed, right? It's about some big game action thing is going on. Note, there is a huge difference between that and the types of ads that I don't care about, which is, I'm getting up to go poop.

227
00:17:42,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm gonna run an ad while I'm in the restroom, or I'm getting up to stretch and hydrate. I'll be back in a minute. Here's an ad while I'm gone. I don't care about that, because they're not going to interrupt key parts of the gameplay that are going on. When you're running those ads that are just 2030 minutes. That is laziness. That is laziness, in my opinion, laziness, to make money that you're not really getting enough to make it worth what you're doing to the audience.

228
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, I had someone I was watching earlier this week when they were talking about like some new updates to Minecraft and stuff. And they were showing off some actually, the stream had just began. And I had already gone through ads already to get to the stream. And then like five minutes later, right as we're getting to like the good part, then it's like, Oh, we're gonna do five ads in a row ad break while you know, everything's going on. So I'm like completely missing what I came to watch.

229
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Which is annoying, but I don't think it was necessarily this person's fault. I don't think they triggered it. But it's just, you know, twitches timing, I guess. All right.

230
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Anyway, up next, we're gonna get to our gaming week. But first, let's run an ad. No, I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna do that to you. But I do want to point out that but not that we're doing that. But that behavior doesn't bother me as much because again, it's intentional. You know, I am taking a break from the content making to do the ad and then I'll get back to the content. And like my

231
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:40,000
non subscribers aren't going to miss anything. And see a Tiberian chat says, but what if you have to go poo every 20 minutes, then number one, eat more fiber. Number two, literally, number two, is that at least again, it's an intentional break. And it's I mean, I might still get annoyed that like, I'm not seeing much. And it seems like I'm watching a lot of ads, but it's far less frustrating than, like, you're in the middle of an action. I'm watching a Dead by Fire.

232
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm watching a Dead by Daylight stream. And I know people that do this in the Dead by Daylight Committee. Again, I'm calling you out. It's lazy in the dead. And it's like, wow, I just missed how this match ended. I see the killer got a 4k. I have no idea how that happened. Because I got a minute's worth of ads when that all went down and the slugging happened.

233
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,280
You just have to remember if you have to poop every 20 minutes, you just use the tag for Twitch. That's frequent pooper. And then they understand that that's what they're getting into in the stream.

234
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:37,280
All right, let's go back to the Microsoft comments on that whole thing. Questbuster says Microsoft might be able to find that balance between being aggressive with ads, or fit them where it works without feeling as if they're in your face, as with EA push short video ads into UFC four that led to huge backlash weeks after the game came out. Yeah, I think I think we all know that doesn't work. And I would hope again, with Phil Spencer at the helm of Microsoft, he knows better. And that's what he's going to do.

235
00:20:37,280 --> 00:21:07,080
He knows better, and they generally know better. So anyway, let's see. And bonds double six says, as Loki says, it depends on the delivery of the ads. If the ads helped me to understand how to tune up my car in a racing game. Cool. If the ads give me updates to complete tasks, that's okay. You know, and ads are in all sorts of forms. You know, somebody brought up much earlier in the chat, I have to scroll up for this one. But somebody had mentioned, oh, Sean 322 said, if you played blades of steel on the NES, there were

236
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:31,960
Konami ads between periods advertising their games. One was a mini game for Gradius. You know, I never really thought of that as an ad. In a way, I mean, it was some really good cross promotion, that's for sure. I guess you could say it was an ad. But I think most of us, especially at that time, you know, in that era found that Gradius game to be that was baked into blades of steel to be kind of awesome.

237
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:44,680
It was kind of awesome. Like that now except you know, Namco was assholes and they decided to you know, patent minigames in games like that are loading screens or something like that. So we can't do that anymore.

238
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:56,880
Hmm. Um, let's see. And then somebody else as Joe and Hunter Matt said, we'll see flow from progressive skins in fortnight. Honestly, I kind of I kind of love it.

239
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:04,440
The spokesperson for progressive anymore because I think I saw a commercial and it's like a different they'd be like, gone with somebody else now.

240
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:31,040
I think it is somebody else now. And dark to see it does point out something I thought was a story about a year ago or so at the show saying actually, I believe that patent expired. I think the Namco patent did expire on the loading screens because I remember that whole thing came up again. Not that long ago. So food for thought. So um, yeah, Bobby is confirming that the mini game and loading screen patent expired a few years ago. So just in time for no more loading screens.

241
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,320
That just shows you how long it's been since Ridge racers come out.

242
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:59,680
All right. Let's see. And yeah, Bobby says there's a whole cast of spokespeople with flow is the leader. Well, I bet you flow is getting more expensive. And that's why they've had to divert they had to let flow know, I made you and I can break you just as easily. So they got more people to be spokespeople as well. So that flows rate doesn't get too high.

243
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:12,440
That's what it is. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week with or without ads. Loki, how was your gaming week?

244
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:36,440
It was all Minecraft. Again, actually, there's a lot of video editing is what it was. And so I got a new episode of my hardcore series out yesterday. Along with the Minecraft stuff, I had conversations with some folks earlier this week. And so there's gonna be some big stuff coming in the summer. So excited to announce more later.

245
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,880
Got a big collab coming.

246
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:36,440
My YouTube Minecraft career thing, I guess, if you will. But I really I was a big fan of these these guys before. So it'll be fun to kind of join with them and stuff. You know, gotta keep moving till we get to hermitcraft. So yeah, so they'll be probably starting this summer. So they haven't made an announcement yet regarding that, but they reached out to me first. And then they opened up applications for everybody else because they saw my content, they, they actually had people that voted for me, and they were like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I

247
00:24:36,440 --> 00:25:06,440
don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

248
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:15,160
Yeah, it's it's a really it's a different type of SMB too. It's more it's it's more like story

249
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:21,480
driven, I guess like they're like super organized. They've got like writers, they have a voice actor

250
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:29,640
that's basically the main narrator kind of he plays a character in the actual game, but doesn't

251
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,360
he's not actually playing Minecraft that character. But he's kind of like the narrator,

252
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,960
the head person that kind of keeps the story going. And then everybody has does their own

253
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,680
thing. But then they kind of work together to keep moving the story along, which is really cool.

254
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,520
So for you, and you're the current people you're with, if they really care about you,

255
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,440
they're gonna understand completely that I'm, I'm not leaving them. I'm gonna be doing both.

256
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,960
Okay. Yeah, I was gonna say the collab might actually be welcomed, you know?

257
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,920
No, no, no. Yeah. So I'm doing both for this season, because one, I'm still running our

258
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,440
server. So I can't really leave, you know, it's like, I'm sorry, but I would I never want to

259
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,000
leave mid season for anything. Anyways, you know, I want to finish what I'm doing. So what I'll

260
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,360
probably end up doing is since that's in the summer, by then, I'm sure my hardcore series

261
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,640
will be wrapped up and should be able to swing both that way. Or if I need to dedicate more time

262
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,760
to one or the other. By the time we get to summer anyways, like I'm gonna be out of like pretty

263
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,240
close to being out of things to build anyways, like I have a lot of projects going on. But like,

264
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,720
it's gonna get to a point where this is a very long season. So I'm just gonna run out of stuff

265
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,680
gonna kind of run out steam there. But I'll find stuff to work with. And it's been kind of slow

266
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,120
going, like we've had several people out this season. There's like, we got another confirmation,

267
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,280
there's somebody that's not going to play anymore on this season, because they're having a kid,

268
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,800
which is understandable. But it's unfortunate, like, like half the people are missing. And then

269
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,680
the other half, we had what my the guys partnering with me right now, he's finally come back on,

270
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,160
but I'm like pushing them to put out his first episode of the season that's been going for six

271
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,080
months now. Like, you know, whereas the other server, they're like, Okay, listen, you got to

272
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,320
release content once a month at the very minimum, you know, we want you to do more than that. You

273
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,160
have to be involved with all this stuff. And they have like a very strict guidelines and rules,

274
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,040
like just to make sure that everybody's focused and everybody's like excited and like engaging in

275
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,640
it. And that's, that's what I'm looking for is like, I need people to be engaged. And that's what

276
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:38,360
when they came to make their their SMP. It's they all came from servers where it kind of ran into

277
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,200
the same thing where it's like, okay, well, I'm motivated to make stuff, but there's like other

278
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,560
everybody else is kind of dropping off and doing something when they get it that like,

279
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,280
real life happens. But like, at the same time, you got to try to do what you can to just

280
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,640
push through and do stuff. I mean, you got to be, you're motivated to do it. And there's a lot of

281
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,320
folks that just aren't. So it's understandable. Neat. Very excited. Well, yeah, that's what's

282
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:08,120
coming later. Okay, awesome. I look forward to it very much. Okay, my gaming week. So I've been

283
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,920
playing Final Fantasy 14, which just got a patch update, and the 6.1 patch. And I've been enjoying

284
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,920
the new content and playing a little bit of the main scenario, I got to do the new dungeon,

285
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,760
which is pretty good. I have not done the raid content or the PvP yet. So I still have a lot

286
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,280
to explore. I got derailed from some of that I did a stream of 14 like the first night I was

287
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,440
playing it on Wednesday because I was doing something else on Tuesday, the actual patch

288
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:39,000
day so I can get to it till Wednesday. But then I got derailed because there was a no man's sky

289
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,880
update. And I know Loki will cover some of the specifics later on. But with the update is a new

290
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,240
twitch campaign with twitch drops. So I've been very motivated to stream no man's sky to help

291
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,640
people get twitch drops. So I got on that and the seasonal campaign there. So I've been enjoying

292
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,000
that and playing that as well. So Loki, I know you'll talk a little more about that update later

293
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,680
in the show. So I won't get into too many of the specifics, but it is something I've been playing.

294
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:09,160
The other big thing I should really talk about is kind of tangential to video games.

295
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:15,400
But on Friday night, Alan and I drove over to San Francisco and we went to the Symphony Hall

296
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,000
to see the San Francisco Symphony present distant worlds music from Final Fantasy,

297
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,280
which is the final fantasy symphonic show where Arnie Roth is the conductor and he's been with

298
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:32,760
this show for a very long time. I want to say he might have done the original dear friends in 2004.

299
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,000
If if memory serves me right, Bobby may be able to because he follows the symphony stuff a little

300
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,880
more than I do. He may be able to correct me there. But I know he's been a part of distant worlds

301
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,120
ever since they turned it into a touring show. Because you know, they did dear friends,

302
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,480
they did more friends, and then they turned it into like the touring show it is now

303
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,560
where like, you know, video games live sort of show that that model can be successful.

304
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:01,080
And distant worlds does their thing too. And I he said during the show, they've been touring it

305
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,040
with it since like 2007. And you know, they've been subbing different songs in and out and so

306
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,200
forth as you know, they go. And it was great. Like it was just nice to have a night out at the

307
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,120
symphony supporting the arts. It's not something you get to combine with the world of video games

308
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,120
that often. But I do feel like pop culture stuff is coming more and more to the symphony because

309
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,840
the symphony is realizing that, you know, younger Gen X, millennial, the later generations

310
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,120
are more interested in that sort of thing, I think, then maybe some of the more traditional

311
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,160
stuff that that usually funds the symphony. So it's nice when there's that kind of blend there.

312
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,920
So yeah, everything was great. My favorite performance that they did was they did a song

313
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:54,360
from 14. So of course, I'm a little biased, but they did Heaven's Word, they did the trailer

314
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,760
music and like the overture to Heaven's Word. And it has a solo opera singer that sings it in a very

315
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,160
high voice. And they actually had somebody doing that live and she nailed it like it was really,

316
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:11,080
really well done. So of course, I love that. And it was interesting to me how Final Fantasy 14 kind

317
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,000
of got the biggest crowd reaction, because he would Arnie Roth will kind of say like, this is

318
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,800
what we're gonna play next is what we're gonna do. And when he talked about 14, there was definitely

319
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:28,120
a lot louder applause from the crowd than maybe for any other game. Save for maybe seven. But and

320
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,320
of course, they played a lot from seven, because there was supposed to be my friend said he had

321
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,400
tickets for a Final Fantasy seven remake symphony that never happened because of COVID. It was timed

322
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,600
around that same time, and it ended up just not happening at all. So I feel like a few of the

323
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,960
pieces may have come over from that. Um, the setlist was interesting. There were some things

324
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,920
that they didn't do that surprised me like the opera from Final Fantasy six really wasn't there.

325
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,800
They had some of it in like another medley of Final Fantasy six stuff. But I was surprised that

326
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,680
wasn't a standalone thing anymore. But that just might take a lot of work and you have to have the

327
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:10,920
right singers to put it together and so forth. Um, Final Fantasy 13, absent. They referenced it in

328
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:17,480
the chocobo medley by showing a clip of the chocobo that lives in Saz's hair. That's it.

329
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,000
That was your Final Fantasy 13 representation. Final Fantasy 11, same thing in the chocobo medley

330
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,520
for a little bit. That's it. So those two games did kind of get crapped on. But

331
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:36,920
when you have a series with 15 games, and a two hour symphony, I understand some stuff's probably

332
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:42,360
going to get cut to the side. I was just surprised we had four songs from Final Fantasy seven,

333
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,720
which included some deep cuts and two songs from nine, which most other fantasy games

334
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,560
only really had one song. And then a real deep cut from Final Fantasy 15. I don't know if anyone

335
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,800
recognized the Final Fantasy 15 song. It was from the Ignis DLC, I believe at least that's what the

336
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,200
video led me to believe because it was all the Ignis solo stuff and then it showed the princess

337
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,280
and a character I didn't even recognize. So because I didn't play 15 past the base game,

338
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:18,840
to be honest. So I thought that was kind of a deep cut. But I understand 15 is the newest game too.

339
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,320
I would love to see a symphony that is around Final Fantasy 14. And I think the audience

340
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,920
reaction shows they'd be down for it too. And you know what a lot of 14 encompasses the earlier

341
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,360
games. I'm surprised they didn't do Final Fantasy three by doing the crystal tower

342
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:42,760
theme from Final Fantasy 14. That was they actually did a the standalone theme from three

343
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,320
though, which surprised me. Just because I thought Final Fantasy three was and I'm not talking about

344
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:53,480
six. I mean, three, the Japanese three. I thought that was a little bit of a deeper cut. So So yeah,

345
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,480
the only games that didn't get a solo piece were two 511 and 13 didn't have a solo piece. But

346
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:06,680
I sort of think five was really highlighted in the battle theme medley quite a bit. And I would

347
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,680
expect that two three and five would be the neglected ones because those were never released

348
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,960
in the US originally. Obviously, we got them eventually. But I think they have less of a

349
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,560
following than the other games because of the nature of how they were released. So but anyway,

350
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,680
I'm bitching a lot about the setlist. It's really not that big of a deal. Again, I understand 35

351
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,560
years of music something's got to give. I think they still did a great job. I think the San

352
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,960
Francisco Symphony and the choir, you know, they don't get to work with this music for a lot of

353
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,520
time because they're they're constantly putting on different shows. So the fact that they can really,

354
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,640
you know, do this music without probably a lot a lot of practice. I'm sure there was some but not

355
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,840
a lot a lot is really impressive. And so you know, kudos, I had a good time. And I would say if

356
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Distant Worlds comes to your town, it's a it's a good night to support the arts, do something a

357
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,920
little different than you might usually do. And be in the good company of other nerds who like

358
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:08,520
Final Fantasy. So like that. Bobby Blackwell says they get one rehearsal three hours long.

359
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,280
That's union rules. That's incredible. That's that's barely enough time to run through the

360
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:20,600
whole thing. That's enough time to run through it all once. And then maybe iron out like the top

361
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:28,760
three rough spots. So that's pretty incredible. All right. I guess that's it for my gaming week.

362
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,320
That was pretty much the big thing I wanted to talk about. Oh, I did. I did go to a cute little

363
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:43,800
bar arcade in San Francisco. They have a little gamer bar in the Castro. It's right at the start

364
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,240
of the Castro kind of near I want to say like 17th and market. It's a place called detour.

365
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,600
And I never been there. I think it's been around for a few years. But because the pandemic and

366
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,160
everything, I haven't been there. But somebody actually offered to buy my table. So there was

367
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:03,080
like four of us at the table. They offered to buy us a game of Killer Queen. So they had somebody

368
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,960
to play against. And I must admit, I'd never played Killer Queen before. But it was very

369
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,440
obvious that because there was like only two of them, they weren't having fun playing it. So they

370
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,760
were like, we need more people to be able to play Killer Queen with. So they actually bought our

371
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,040
game. So I was able to actually play that a little bit. And a friend of our JD was with me,

372
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,040
and he had played because Killer Queens on the switch. So he'd played it and he was able to

373
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,200
explain it up so I could get the gist of what was going on. So that was fun. If you haven't played,

374
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,160
that's like a five on five game in the arcade. And there's like multiple ways to win. And it's just

375
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,960
it's just chaos, but it's fun, because it's so chaotic. So that was that was that, of course, I,

376
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,560
I may have allegedly had a few vodka diets at that point. So I was already feeling a little like,

377
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:52,760
video games. So yeah, I had a good time. So I bonds double six says yeah, Killer Queen needs

378
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,400
a five versus five to really enjoy it. We didn't have that. But we had like three on three. So it

379
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,800
kind of worked. It was fun enough, especially considering somebody else bought the games,

380
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:09,000
which was really kind. All right, uh, we will still be here with the show next week. Except

381
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,680
Loki will not be here next week. But Dark Sakura will be back. So and Loki talked about all that

382
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:21,160
last week. But yeah, he hasn't taken all the time off for all the fun reasons. Yes. So it's a

383
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:28,600
medical related thing. But it's it's a normal procedure. You'll be fine. But yeah, so we look

384
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:34,680
forward to welcoming you back in a couple weeks. So yep. All right. Let's move on and get into this

385
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,320
week's news. Probably a little less of it this week, just because I don't know if it's with

386
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,720
Easter and other holidays going on. It's slower, but I feel like there's less going on this week.

387
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:50,520
We'll talk about what's happening, including the latest in this this this story's just keeps on

388
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,000
this. This is turning into R Kelly's trapped in the closet. And I'm sorry, as I know,

389
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,640
he's a very problematic individual. But many people are very familiar with his opera. What is

390
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,680
it 2025 parts trapped in a closet. And I feel like the Activision Blizzard case is becoming

391
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,760
trapped in the closet. Loki, what happened this week?

392
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,080
It's like trapped in a drive thru, you know? Wow.

393
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:28,520
So apparently, there's accusations now that California is Governor Gavin Newsom has been

394
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:38,600
interfering with the ongoing DFEH investigation of Activision Blizzard. Apparently, he had fired

395
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:46,600
the top prosecutor for the case, or I should say the what was it the chief counsel was fired

396
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:53,640
by him. And then the assistant chief counsel had resigned in protest. They had alleged that he had

397
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:59,080
been his office had been repeatedly demanding advanced notice of litigation strategy and of

398
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:08,520
next steps in the litigation as if someone's feeding them the information. Also that they

399
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:18,520
started. Apparently, there's interference that the Newsom's office also said mimicked the interests

400
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:28,360
of Activision's counsel, protect, they tried to protect the agency's independence. So it's not

401
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,720
not a good allegation. That's for sure. I'm not really sure how much evidence there is in this.

402
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,720
But like, if it is true, then that's horrible. But you know, rich people tend to rub each other's

403
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:47,640
backs, you know, so if he's, you know, tied in with Bobby Kotick in any way, you know,

404
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,400
maybe, maybe that's why he's trying to make it go away, or I don't know, I don't know what they're

405
00:39:53,400 --> 00:40:01,720
doing necessarily. But apparently, that there's, I guess, the office, of course, is claiming that

406
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,280
none of this is true. So maybe there'll be some sort of investigation into the investigation.

407
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,280
Which will just make everything take longer. That's interesting that that's the conclusion

408
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,720
people are arriving at is that maybe he's trying to stop the governor is trying to

409
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,560
lessen the investigation because there was I thought when I first heard this, it was the

410
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:31,320
other way around, that he was wanting to make sure that it was more aggressive, that he could then be

411
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,160
seen as a champion in his state for these sorts of, you know, the unions in the gaming industry,

412
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,000
find it. I don't know, it's interesting that there's two ways to look at it, right? Because

413
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,720
I thought it was the other way about it, like, honestly, because like, you know, for me, given

414
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:54,280
the opportunity for a politician to do something, you know, if it's like, such and such politician

415
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,720
was found to have, I'm going to assume that's going to be negative, because it's typically

416
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:07,320
always negative. You know, we always hear about like, insider trading, or spending taxpayer money

417
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:14,840
on nonsense, or, you know, well, my, my mind also goes to that, you know, the people that

418
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,320
district attorney or whoever that magically resigned in the New York case about the Trump

419
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,480
prosecution, and I know we're getting away from video games, but I'm trying to show you the common

420
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,840
denominator here is that, you know, I kind of thought, because you know, that all and it looks

421
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:35,240
like now that case is fizzling out, because of that all happening, that maybe that got Newsome's

422
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,280
attention wanting to make sure the same thing doesn't happen here in California, and was maybe

423
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,960
worried it was going down that road. That's just what I drew out of it. I mean, and again, we don't

424
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,440
know, it could it could very well be what you're saying as well, Loki, which would be disgusting.

425
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,280
And I'd be very, very upset with how much I've supported Newsome over the years to find out if

426
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:01,000
that was the case. Yeah, I don't know which way it is, but I don't like meddling either way.

427
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,280
I mean, just let it happen. Let let the, you know, look at the departments that are, you know,

428
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,800
meant to do this stuff. Take it do their jobs like you don't need to interfere with it.

429
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,080
As 200 mountain chat says there are some groups within the investors asking others to vote against

430
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:26,280
the Microsoft acquisition because Kotick is getting a payout. Fair. Fair concern. Absolutely.

431
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:34,280
I understand. So yeah, we'll have to see what develops. But I mean, hopefully this I mean,

432
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:41,720
it's going to slow the whole process down. But hopefully not too much. It's just interesting

433
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,800
that now it just involves the governor of all things on top of everything else. I mean, what

434
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,000
now when does the White House get involved? Because I feel like that's where it's going next.

435
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:59,560
It's just layers upon layers. Anyhow, in quite a bit less serious news, but back into the video

436
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:05,160
game world and things I think I'm kind of looking forward to Capcom arcade stadium is getting a

437
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:11,160
sequel. So there's going to be Capcom arcade second stadium. Now we'd already had hints that

438
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,320
this was happening because of like, I think it was a Korean ratings board leak or one of the rating

439
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:21,320
boards internationally leaked it. But it was confirmed by Capcom this week. 32 more classic

440
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:28,280
titles will be coming to the second Capcom arcade stadium. It has also confirmed this lineup will be

441
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:35,640
on switch PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC. And the free game in the list will be son son or son

442
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:41,640
son is the free game that's in the list. It's it's kind of a deep cut. I don't think it's a game

443
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,280
you're going to recognize right off the bat. But if you've played other Capcom collections over the

444
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:56,360
years, you might recognize the game. So and it's it's it's free. So check it out. So yeah, three

445
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:03,320
wonders is also getting a is also going to be a bonus in the Capcom fighting collection that was

446
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:09,480
confirmed in the same tweet by Capcom of Europe. So they're kind of, you know, teasing in advance

447
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,920
these upcoming releases. We don't know what else is going to be in the Capcom arcade stadium second

448
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:20,040
stadium yet. I would imagine maybe we'll find out a little more games calm seems to be a good time

449
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:27,000
to figure this out. Yes, so we'll see. Oh, good point. sj 100. Matt, I forgot about that. son son

450
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:34,520
is in MVC too. I forgot that that is a like a character in that. So awesome. Dr. Julia says the

451
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,960
second they confirm Black Tiger I'm putting down my pre order and that son son was in Capcom

452
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,320
collections one on PlayStation two. It wasn't it they had a big collection on PlayStation three as

453
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:52,520
well wasn't it in that? I don't know cap cap calm like Sega, like other companies tends to revisit

454
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,600
the retro catalog frequently but not that I mind Capcom's got a lot of great shit in the retro

455
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,400
catalog. The first arcade stadium was pretty cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what they put

456
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,680
together in the second. I'm a little surprised they didn't just expand the first stadium with

457
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,600
the additional titles. But I understand that maybe they need some different stuff in it to make it

458
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:20,280
work and all that. So wow, I didn't. Tada. I didn't you know what I just learned? If someone follows

459
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,000
my personal channel, the alert will still come through even though I'm broadcasting on fog.

460
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,880
So somebody must have just followed my personal channel. Well, thank you, whoever that was.

461
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:39,000
That's funny. All right. Anyhow, let's move on Loki. I talked about this earlier.

462
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:48,200
Yeah, so no man's sky got another update. So the outlaws update, which adds space pirates and

463
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:56,120
lots of other stuff. I know they had like solar sails and, you know, cool little expansions,

464
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:02,840
I think to your base and stuff. But some folks are complaining that maybe it's not exactly

465
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:09,240
as polished as they had hoped. There's apparently been instances where too many

466
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:15,240
pirates are attacking players. There's one person that was mentioning that they got

467
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:23,720
attacked by pirates six times in the course of 10 minutes. So maybe they need to dial that down a bit.

468
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,360
Well, I have some good news for you. They in the experimental build on steam,

469
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,840
which is kind of like their test, they have acknowledged that the pirates are spanning,

470
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,160
spawning too often. So they've toned that down. And the pirates no longer spawn in low

471
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,400
galaxy, low conflict galaxies, and they don't spawn while you're like underground. So they

472
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,680
have tried to cut it back a little bit. That's good. And then they've revamped the aerial combat.

473
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:54,520
Aerial combat. They have done a bunch of other updates as well. So

474
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,320
yeah, I mean, it looked really cool. I really need to go back and play it.

475
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,560
I think I downloaded it the other day in hopes to like play it at some point on this new PC. I know

476
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:10,680
it looked really pretty when I was watching you play it. And then of course, you know, everybody's

477
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,680
saying, well, you know, no man's sky is pretty awesome and stuff. But what's next for Hello

478
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:22,920
Games? And of course, Sean Murray is talking about his next project, which he says is pretty

479
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,920
ambitious. Similar to no man's sky. It's kind of a project that even if we had 1000 people working

480
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:36,520
on it, it seemed impossible. Stop hyping it up, dude. Stop didn't Kotaku write an article that

481
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:42,680
was basically Hey, Sean Murray, shut up, like shut up, like, that is a stop talking on Murray

482
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:50,680
from hyping up no man's sky successor. Yes, that he needs to learn the lesson like, you know,

483
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:58,680
tempered the expectations. I agree. I agree. But gamers also need to learn the lesson

484
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:05,640
to stop buying into so much fucking hype. At least, you know, Lacey has like some credit,

485
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:11,880
obviously, because you know, no man's sky is a great game that's constantly getting updates.

486
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:18,600
Oh, yeah, I'll be buying this new game, whatever, whatever it is. And I realized I could be opening

487
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:24,840
myself up for trouble. Whatever this game is, I will be buying it day one. Because of how much I

488
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:31,960
love no man's sky and what it's become now. The thing is, I was just like, he needs to give it

489
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:38,120
time. He needs to not rush it out. You know, I thankfully, hopefully that they can publish it

490
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,280
independently, not necessarily like being published by Sony or something like that.

491
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,040
So I think that may have had a little bit to do with, you know, pushing that out earlier than

492
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:52,600
it needed to be. But I'm hoping that he'll take his time released when it's ready. That type of

493
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:58,120
stuff. But I'm excited to see whatever he's working on next. Yeah, perhaps not the game

494
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:03,560
awards this year. Yeah, with my luck, the game will be man a sports or something at this point,

495
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,120
after I just said I'm buying it no matter what.

496
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:17,000
But I love no man's sky so much now. And it's so well supported. I can't imagine I won't buy

497
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,840
whatever they say is coming up next, whether that's no man's sky to I would be so into like

498
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:28,200
an adventure game. That's extremely open world type of thing like using the same procedural

499
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,880
generation. I think it will be procedural generation of some sort. But I don't think

500
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,000
it'll necessarily be space again. But it could be procedural generation on a planet,

501
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,640
like one world that you're exploring, like an entire world to question or something I could

502
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,520
be really exciting. I don't know. We'll see. I don't want to hype it up either. Like honestly,

503
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,920
I don't want to hype it up either or set my expectations. I look forward to whatever it is.

504
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:56,120
And honestly, I bought the last campfire, which I mean, Hello Games just published,

505
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:01,080
they didn't really have much to do with it otherwise. And it was cute. And I enjoyed it.

506
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:07,480
I even bought that just because I had Hello Games name on it. So and I wasn't disappointed. But I

507
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:15,160
also didn't, you know, drink the Kool Aid too much. You know, I'm not going to complain because

508
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:22,680
you all are following my personal channel. So keep it up. Honestly. This is the wild thing is,

509
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:29,960
here's the weird thing. It's not on that that whole like thing is not on this current scene.

510
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,640
So I don't know how that audio is leaking through. Because it shouldn't be anyway,

511
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,640
I need to go back and take lessons on how to broadcast apparently,

512
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,360
mute the audio source and OBS. It shouldn't even be a thing.

513
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:54,120
That's just weird. I'll have to figure it out later. Anyway, yeah. Um, I guess I'd have to.

514
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:02,200
The problem is I'm live with OLR. I would have to switch to my thing and mute it there. I don't

515
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,400
know. Anyway, I'm not going to worry about it. If we get random Windows 95 sounds playing during

516
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,360
the stream tonight. You know what? Worst things have happened around here at OLR after 910

517
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:18,360
episodes. So I will not I will not mind the accentuation of my points with a tada. So by

518
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:27,400
all means follow Rob Roberts on Twitch. And while you're at it, Loki OLR on YouTube.

519
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,200
And I suppose the sharpest shout out for dark soccer even though she's not here tonight

520
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:39,480
on Twitch. All right, uh, let's see. Um, the no man's sky update. The other thing I wanted to say

521
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:47,720
I um, I do like the update but I agree the pirates are way too over tuned and I wish there was a way

522
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:53,160
to play more passively. I don't like that they got harder in space with the shields.

523
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,000
And I just wish there was a way when you warp into a new system and they're fighting the frigate.

524
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,520
I wish you could just ignore it. And like not keep getting harassed about it because you could

525
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:10,040
just fly past it but it'll keep bothering you until you go kill those pirates. So that's the

526
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:15,800
part that I really need the team to iron out is like if I want to play pacifist, let me play

527
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:22,040
pacifist. And I don't mean creative mode. I don't mind a little bit of danger when it comes to

528
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:27,240
surviving on the planet and things of that sort. I just don't necessarily and fighting pirates when I

529
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:32,200
want to. I just don't necessarily want to do it all the time. So that's that's my only kind of

530
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:39,000
complaint. But I feel like some of the stuff is a little more limited to the fact that I'm in the

531
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,880
seasonal mode right now, the current expedition. And so maybe it's a little over tuned because the

532
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:52,920
pirates are the theme of the expedition. So there is that. So all right, moving on. What do we have

533
00:52:52,920 --> 00:53:01,480
next? Let's talk about the auto renewal of premium subs on the various consoles. So you might remember

534
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:07,000
this because Microsoft went through this a few weeks ago, where they started to change some of

535
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,120
their rules around auto renewal and automatically canceling some people's Xbox Gold if they don't

536
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:20,280
touch it for two years. Well, interestingly enough, Sony and Nintendo are starting to do

537
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:26,040
similar things. Sony as of this week will bug PlayStation plus subscribers ahead of time before

538
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,320
the renewal occurs and instruct a user on how to cancel their service and they will not charge

539
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:36,920
users who are not using it. Nintendo will automatically turn off auto renewal at the time

540
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:43,000
of purchase instead of the default toggle of on, which is the default. Why is this all happening?

541
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:49,880
It could possibly be credited to the UK competitions and markets authority or CMA,

542
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,800
because they have been looking at the big three of Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.

543
00:53:54,760 --> 00:54:00,360
And Microsoft, of course, did their update in January. And now Sony and Nintendo are following

544
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,440
suit. The director of enforcement Michael Grenfell with the CMA said in a quote, today's

545
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:12,600
announcement therefore concludes our investigations into the online video gaming sector, companies and

546
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:18,440
other sectors, which offer subscriptions that auto renew should review their practices to ensure they

547
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,960
comply with consumer protection law. So that's interesting is that the CMA and the UK is

548
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,960
declaring victory they are playing the Final Fantasy victory fanfare because the big three

549
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,720
have all made changes to their rules. By the way, I think this is interesting,

550
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:40,520
because something that I noticed happening more and more on PlayStation plus is that if you use

551
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:47,160
the app, you get a push notification that says, hey, don't forget to claim your free games this

552
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,960
month. The month's almost up. Don't forget to claim your free games. And now that I'm reading

553
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:58,040
this, Sony will bug PlayStation plus subscribers ahead of time and instruct users on how to cancel

554
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:04,360
their service and will not charge users who are not using it. But if they're reminding you to

555
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:14,200
cash in your free games, you're using it, aren't you? So the CMA may have won a victory. But did

556
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,160
they win a victory? I don't know. I guess that's really in the eye of the consumer. You have the

557
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,880
right to cancel your games or cancel your subscriptions whenever you want.

558
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:31,160
But there are a lot of people who just kind of set it and forget it. So anyway, interesting that

559
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:37,000
all the big three have kind of done that. And some folks in chat are talking about, let's see,

560
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Zen Monkey says today Microsoft gave me Game Pass for $1 and gave me a $10 credit for some reason,

561
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,200
fun times. And Bonds006 says, yeah, Microsoft gave me so many $10 credits over the years.

562
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:53,080
And I think you guys are probably reading that there's something similar going on there.

563
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:59,320
What is $10 to Microsoft if they get to keep your $60 Xbox Gold subscription,

564
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:06,600
or maybe even more for Game Pass for the next year? It's worth it to them. By the way,

565
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,080
stay tuned because I have something you can spend that $10 credit on. And we'll get into that a

566
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:16,040
little later in the show. There's something really cool coming up that I can't wait to talk about.

567
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:21,560
But for now, we'll move on to this story, which just it makes me giggle. I don't know what else

568
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:28,440
to say. Loki, go ahead. It's just it's, it's hardcore. Yes. So there are some hardcore fans

569
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:35,000
of Club Penguin out there. And of course, there were some folks that developed a quote unquote

570
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:43,320
fan game Club Penguin re written that was, I guess, operating since I don't know 2017 or

571
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,320
something like that. Like the year after they shut down Club Penguin, I think Yeah,

572
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:52,680
it was very shortly after they shut down. Well, apparently the three or three of the folks that

573
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:59,400
were responsible for it have been under investigation by the city police of London,

574
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:06,200
and I think Kevin arrested for copyright infringement, because they were apparently,

575
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,960
you know, violating copyright because they don't know the rights to Club Penguin. And in fact,

576
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,240
the game's web page now says the site has been taken over by the operation creative

577
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:28,360
police intellectual property crime unit. And I, I just can't believe I mean, I can't believe

578
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:34,280
but I can't believe with everything going on in this industry, Activision Blizzard,

579
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,600
and other companies out there. Someone finally got arrested over fucking Club Penguin.

580
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,160
It's because and I'll tell you why it's because they were making money off of it.

581
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,920
Because of course, running a game like this costs money. And it says therefore ads are

582
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,720
placed in certain parts of the game we or at least I assume that's how Disney got us.

583
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:03,320
As absolutely how Disney got you, you fool. Don't put ads in a game that is doesn't belong to you.

584
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,880
I mean, it was operating on thin ice as it was. I mean,

585
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:13,240
I mean, I know some companies like Sega have been really cool when they shut down an MMO.

586
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,520
They basically like came up with a way for people to download Phantasy Star Online blueburst data so

587
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:25,480
you could play it on pirate servers, but that's Sega not Disney. So I cannot believe we finally

588
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,440
have an arrest in the gaming industry and it's over fucking Club Penguin. And Bobby Kotick

589
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:37,000
walks free. Bobby Kotick he's come on now they are allowed to you know, perpetuate you know,

590
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,680
all sorts of sexual harassment at their workplace. But you make a fan club penguin

591
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,720
game and dare to charge and money or dare to get money from ads to run that game.

592
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,520
You're going straight to the slammer. That's how we get those pores.

593
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:00,040
Where are our priorities? All right. Anyhow, we need to go back to a simpler time when I don't

594
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,920
know if people were getting arrested over video games. It was because they were starting fights

595
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,280
at arcades. I don't know. Let's roll the bumper for this segment.

596
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:24,280
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

597
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,240
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

598
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,400
Haha, no, you won't because you're not here. But I'm here. And I will talk about this week's

599
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,880
classic game of the week, which is my pick. And perhaps you recognize it from the little

600
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:44,280
bit of video they're playing on Twitch. But for the rest of you and on the podcast feed,

601
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:49,480
the game we are looking at is civilization four is the classic game of the week this week

602
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:57,000
originally released for Microsoft Windows in North America, October 25 2005. And dark soccer

603
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:03,240
if you're out there, yes, there was a Mac release as well June 30 of 2006. So civilization four,

604
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:08,600
of course, is the fourth game in the civilization series. The designer behind the game was Soren

605
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:13,640
Johnson. And of course, Sid Meyer, whose name is really synonymous with a lot of the older

606
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:19,560
civilization titles as well as a lot of the great fair access and you know, 4k titles at the time.

607
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:26,200
Sid Meyer is the director of the game. It was, of course, followed by civilization five and six and

608
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:31,720
hopefully someday seven. Civilization four, of course, is one of the all time great 4x games.

609
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:38,760
That means you explore, expand, exploit, exterminate. That's what 4x means. So it's

610
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,880
to me, it feels a little bit like a board game. But like a really big one. And I know there

611
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:49,720
actually is a civilization board game. But this I'm just talking about like what I felt when I was

612
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,560
playing this game because I love civilization for I love the original civilization. But I've done

613
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:58,040
the original civilization as a classic game of the week a long time ago. But I thought, you know,

614
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:03,560
we had the Grammy Awards a couple weeks ago, and we had our second video game Grammy win.

615
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,080
Well, you know, where the first video game Grammy win came from, of course, was this game

616
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:12,120
civilization for and the soundtrack Baba Yetu, which was created by Christopher 10, which is

617
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:18,360
a song about the Lord's Prayer and Swahili. That was the original Grammy winning song that could

618
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:24,200
be credited to a video game. And that was from the intro to civilization for also kind of really

619
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,360
cool about this game that you may not have realized. Some of the quotes voice acting in the

620
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:34,680
game relating to technology and narration were Leonard Nimoy doing that so and obviously, we've

621
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:39,800
lost him since this game was released in 2005. So pretty awesome that we have something to remember

622
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:46,520
him by. And of course, we know that Baba Yetu is the big song from the game. But the soundtrack

623
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:53,560
also has other medieval Renaissance and Baroque origin music. The design for the title music was

624
01:01:53,560 --> 01:02:01,320
influenced by the Lion King, which I can kind of see it. So it's pretty cool. So lots of mods that

625
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:06,920
go with this game, you can do earth Greek world, so forth. There's lots of lots of ways to mod this

626
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:13,880
game. There's many ways to win this game, you can do a combat victory, you can take over the world

627
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:19,800
with your units, you can win a science victory where you blast off into space and and fortify

628
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:25,560
space. I believe in this one, you could do other victories like was this the one that we started

629
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,480
cultural victories? Or did that come later? I can't remember if that was later in the series

630
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,240
or not. But there were multiple ways to win. And that was something kind of a little bit unique to

631
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:42,440
the Forex series as well. Um, let's see, also, this game was more open to customization than

632
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:48,360
the predecessors because the game data and the rules were in XML files. And a software development

633
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:54,520
kit or SDK was released in April 2006 to let you customize the game AI. So if you wanted to go back

634
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:59,400
to a world where Gandhi was a meanie, like he was the original civilization because of an error,

635
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:04,760
you could do that with the SDK. The map editor, you could use Python. So that's kind of fun that

636
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:09,560
you could do all sorts of editing with the game as well. How was the reception to the game?

637
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:16,600
One million units of this game sold by mid March of 2006. It was pretty regularly in the top 10

638
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:23,000
positions of computer game sales charts. It was the 11th best selling computer game of 2005.

639
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:29,800
It had a 94 on Metacritic if you care about that sort of things, getting praised for things like

640
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:35,000
advanced 3d computer graphics, difficult AI, and the multiplayer feature or feature as well.

641
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:41,320
Uh, IGN and their review mentioned that the game AI was way better than it was in Civilization 3.

642
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:48,840
And in my opinion, it was much better than Civilization 3. This is also interesting. In

643
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:56,600
August 2016, when Time put together their 50 best video games of all time list, Civilization 4

644
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:02,520
placed 11th. So it's really considered one of the best of all time. And one of my favorites,

645
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:09,640
and you might be wondering, why did I pick four? Why didn't I pick two or three? I pick for one,

646
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:14,280
the Grammy tie in is sort of that, but four really does remain one of my favorite Civ games.

647
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,600
It might, you know, I think the original always is going to hold a special place in my heart.

648
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:23,720
But I think four is really probably one of the best outside of the original. I think six is

649
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:28,680
really good too, as is five. I think three is the worst in my opinion. It's not bad. It's not a bad

650
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:34,040
game by any means. This is the worst Civilization game. Um, so there is that. So, uh, yeah, I like,

651
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:40,360
I like Civ 4, uh, to be honest, uh, going to chat. Darktot Studio says, I think I still have Civ 3

652
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:45,800
on Steam. I remember that was one of the physical games I ever owned. They gave away Civ 3 for dirt

653
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:51,080
cheap at some point. I'm sure you picked it up, uh, at some point. Zen Monkey says Civ 4 was the

654
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:58,040
last good one. If you're into the spy game, they fucked up in, uh, Civ 5 and Civ 6 and SSJ 100,

655
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:03,560
Matt, bringing up the infamous, just one more turn saying it was so easy to fall into a six

656
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:10,600
hour play session and not realize it as soon as Matt also asking, didn't Rob pick civilization

657
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:16,360
revolution as a game of the week? At one point, I don't know if I did did Civ rev specifically.

658
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:21,880
I know I've done the original civilization. I don't know if I did Civ rev. If I didn't, I should,

659
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,520
but I probably won't revisit the series again for a while because a, this is dark soccer segment.

660
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,920
She was a, she picks the game. It's only when she's not here that I do or, or Loki does. So,

661
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:35,400
um, it'll probably be a while before I get to Civ revolution, but I do love that game in the

662
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:41,960
series as well, because it was a throwback to the original. It was almost like the original game in

663
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:49,320
a more modern engine. And that's why I liked Civ rev and Civ rev came out after this, it was between

664
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:54,440
four and five. So in the timeline, it's pretty similar. Uh, the other big thing that came out

665
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:00,360
in the Civ four timeline was the colonization remake because Sid Meier also did a game called

666
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:06,120
colonization. Uh, and it ran, it had some big, big differences than the regular civilization.

667
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:11,960
Uh, and that had come out for PC, you know, back in the day, and then they redid it in Civ four's

668
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:18,200
engine, which was interesting. So, uh, yeah, lots of good stuff from civilization in this decade.

669
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,400
And again, quite honestly, I would love nothing more than to see this game, uh, get a seventh

670
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,760
entry in the series. We're due for it. This is the time to announce it. Civ six has gotten its

671
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:35,800
last expansion. And, um, I want to say it's been a good five or six years since Civ six at this

672
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:42,360
point, granted the pandemic. There is summer games Fest. There's, you know, lots of opportunity

673
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:47,160
to announce a Civ seven. I would be very happy about that. But again, with the pandemic affecting

674
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,840
development and something like that too, I also would not be surprised if maybe it's a next year

675
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:57,320
thing, because I would bet Civ seven is probably going to be eyed for release on consoles as well

676
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:04,680
as PC because Civ six was so, but anyway, we're talking about Civ four and Civ four was, uh,

677
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:10,600
not the case. They, they, the console's kind of got Civ Rev instead, but Civ Rev was great.

678
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:16,520
So there it is your classic game of the week civilization for one of the very best in the

679
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,320
series. One of my favorites and Loki, you've played a bit of that game too, right?

680
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:25,560
No. Oh, I thought you'd had, I own them, but I haven't played them. They're in my backlog.

681
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:31,560
You were able to buy like the entire thing, like Civ four and all of its DLC. You could buy for

682
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:35,160
like a dollar at one point or they gave it away in a humble bundle or something.

683
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:41,640
I think I did get it in a humble bundle. Um, or maybe I got a steam sale. I know I do have it.

684
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:48,200
I think I have four. I may have six. I can't remember.

685
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:54,120
Six is good too. Zen monkey says we probably won't get Civ seven for a long time. Civ six

686
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:58,680
has that endless update shit they're doing with the new front tear nonsense. They plan on making

687
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:03,800
it a 10 year game like GTA five. I have to admit I have fallen out of Civ six since it first came

688
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:09,320
out. It's nothing against the game. It's just that I don't have 12 hour weekend binges to spend

689
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,560
playing it anymore. And that's exactly what happens. Um, but you know, Civ is always going

690
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:18,920
to hold a special place in my heart at such a good series. So I think I just want Civ seven.

691
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,400
So I have an excuse to revisit it full well knowing that I'm going to lose an entire fucking

692
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,520
weekend of playing the game. Interesting. So I don't have six or four. I have three and five.

693
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:33,720
Five. Five's good. I like five. Five was the first one that did the hexagons. If I remember

694
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,240
right. It changed the shape of the board and I there's a lot about five. I really like.

695
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,880
So all right. There it is your classic game of the week.

696
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,160
Uh, just a few rapid fire stories for you tonight from Loki.

697
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:54,040
Yep. So, um, well, there's going to be some new games coming to Xbox that you might have

698
01:08:54,040 --> 01:09:01,000
seen on other platforms. So bug snacks and Godfall are going to be coming to the Xbox,

699
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:07,720
series X and S, uh, later this month, Godfall a game that no one really wanted to play on

700
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:13,080
the PlayStation bucks next. So yeah, that that's pretty good. Um, bucks nice is going to be coming

701
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:18,040
out at the end of this month on April 28th and it will be part of game pass as well.

702
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:22,680
So you can check that out. And apparently it's also getting released on intend to switch as well

703
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:30,760
and getting a free expansion. Um, Godfall. I'm not sure when that's coming out necessarily,

704
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:38,360
but it is coming out at some point. That's cool. Um, I, uh, I guess it already came out.

705
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:43,240
That's what happened. It came out last week. Oh, and nobody seemed to notice. Um,

706
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:50,440
the exclusive windows must've run out for Sony on those, uh, clearly. So, uh, I wonder if Godfall

707
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:55,000
will get that free edition. I might, I'll check it out if it's free, but I'm not going to pay money

708
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,880
to check it out. They'd be smart to put Godfall on game pass. They probably get more curious though.

709
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:05,720
So, I mean, I don't know, uh, the PC exclusive because we know Sony's been dipping their toe

710
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:10,520
into the PC. So that exclusive window tends to be a little different than, um, Microsoft or whatever.

711
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:17,240
Yeah. Which is fun because now I don't have to, I will not that I can own a PlayStation five right

712
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:22,200
now if I wanted to, but like, like the best of both worlds, I can get almost all the games on PC.

713
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:27,320
Well, I'll still get a PS five, right? Right. At this point, I'm waiting for one of two things,

714
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:35,640
a final fantasy 16 release date, um, or, uh, the, uh, uh, a hardware refresh for the PS five.

715
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,560
I would say two years after the release of the console, which will be this holiday would be the

716
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:44,200
time to expect a hardware refresh, but I don't know because of the pandemic, because of the

717
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:49,400
supply issues, it may not happen. And I full well realize that, but I'm on, I'm saying that on one

718
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:54,120
hand, but then on the other hand, I'm like, but they're still pushing forward with this VR stuff.

719
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:59,240
So I feel like something's going to give in that department. So I'm, uh, I'm gonna,

720
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:03,960
I'm gonna see what the summer has in store for PlayStation, but I really, you know, I,

721
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:09,480
I will drop everything to play fall fantasy 16, a hundred percent. Are you kidding me? Uh,

722
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:14,360
creative business unit three who made 14 gets to make a single player final fantasy. I am

723
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:20,360
there. Like I will take days off work to play fall fantasy 16, which I didn't think I'd still

724
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:25,000
be doing in my forties, taking time off work to play video games, but I will do it for that game.

725
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,560
Not that the expectations are high or anything.

726
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:36,200
No, not at all, but 15 was kind of meh. So, I mean, can you really get any worse than that?

727
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,880
famous last words.

728
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:46,520
Yeah, I, I don't, I, I never finished 15. I got bored of it so fast.

729
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,880
I don't play a lot of people didn't.

730
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,160
Like, I just need to go back and play it.

731
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:57,320
Sure. What, anything else in rapid fire news?

732
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:09,000
Yeah. So then also we've got, um, there's a new, I guess, the arrival add on for doom and doom two

733
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,920
for the switch. It's, um, additional content for the switch version of the game that you can,

734
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:22,520
download, I guess, from in the game. And it's an 11 episode replacement pack that was created by,

735
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,640
Pavara. And it says features music by the doom community.

736
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:37,640
AD 79 is I guess the composer of that. That's pretty cool. And I guess it's not the only

737
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:41,160
add on that they've had for the switch version. So neat.

738
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:48,680
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some games that'll be coming out soon

739
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:57,800
for you to play. Yep. Not a whole lot. So we've got, it looks like, um, Star Wars, the force

740
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:07,960
unleashed on Nintendo switch, uh, Chernobyl light, um, on PlayStation five and X-Box series,

741
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:17,400
Pocky and Rocky re-shined on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four teardown on PC. I guess that's

742
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:25,800
coming out of early access cause that's been out already. Um, Yomari or, uh, let me pronounce this,

743
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:35,640
uh, Yomawari on Intel switch and PlayStation four. And I believe that is it. All right.

744
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:41,880
Maybe you can do the UK dates here while I do the Japan ones here. Um, so going to Japan tonight,

745
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,840
uh, on the Nintendo switch coming out on April 21st, Pocky and Rocky re-shined also gets a

746
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,840
release on the switch. Um, but it is, it's, it's released in Japan, but it's still the English

747
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:58,440
version. Uh, also coming out, uh, e-baseball powerful pro yucky 2022. So for those of you

748
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:04,920
that want to play another Konami sports game, e-baseball, sending you my thoughts and prayers

749
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:11,080
that that is a wise investment. Uh, WRC 10 is also coming out, uh, in Japan this week on the

750
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:17,800
switch and world war Z gets a Japanese release, uh, on the switch this week as well. Uh, going

751
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:25,400
to the PlayStation five, um, hyper dimension, Neptunia sisters versus sisters, a sister special

752
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:30,440
limited edition, uh, is available as well as a regular edition that is out on the PlayStation

753
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:35,000
five this week. Uh, for those of you that, you know, want to play, uh, uh, some more,

754
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,280
uh, hyperdimensional Neptunia games, uh, that is really it on the PlayStation five

755
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:45,080
PlayStation four tends to have pretty similar releases to the switch. Uh,

756
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:50,120
Yomawari three is there as well. You hit that hyperdimensional Neptunia game on PlayStation

757
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:57,240
four as well. Uh, and, uh, Oh, I chemco RPG selection volume nine. My goodness. They keep

758
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:03,880
cranking these out. This one with as divine saga, ghost sink, sort of a plesia and ambition record.

759
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,240
They just keep cranking those chemco collections out. But, um, a lot of those games will otherwise

760
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:14,440
probably get lost to time just because I think very few of them were localized over here. That's

761
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:22,520
for sure. So there you go. Dark to see it does say about e-baseball. I hear the baseball game is okay.

762
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:27,880
It's e-football that's the dumpster fire. Well, can you see why I have concern?

763
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:35,160
Dark Tetsuya. I'm a little preemptively cautious. I'm skeptical of these claims.

764
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:39,000
Just saying no offense, my friend. Loki. How about Europe?

765
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:47,080
Uh, Europe has MotoGP 22 on PlayStation, X-Box and the switch. And they're also getting,

766
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:54,040
uh, Chernobyl light on PlayStation. That's it. Excellent. All right. We have some more stories.

767
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:58,920
We'll be inviting your calls in a little while though, over at vog network.com

768
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,320
slash discord. And we have at least one email tonight. So we do have some emails to get to.

769
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:08,120
So we'll have ourselves a listener round table in just a minute, but first some more news Loki.

770
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:15,320
Yes. So this is something that is near and dear to my kid's heart. And that is the

771
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:21,720
new Sonic the Hedgehog game in Roblox. That's right. So the new soccer Hedgehog game has been

772
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:30,120
published and it is in Roblox. It's Sonic speed simulator. And it's basically a 3d,

773
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:37,640
uh, Sonic game that you can play in Roblox. And this is in partner with of course, Sega.

774
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:44,280
And, uh, my kids have been just playing the crap out of this, but is it any good or is it kind of

775
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:49,320
garbage? It looks, it looks pretty, no, it doesn't look garbage actually. Cause you know, it's, it's,

776
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:55,000
it's put together by professional developers that, you know, make, you know, different games and

777
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,560
stuff, but it's not just made by kids or something like that. And there have been Sonic games that

778
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:03,480
of course been just made by kids and thrown in there and stuff, but no, this is actually

779
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:11,000
polished in, you know, uh, looks pretty good. And like I said, they've been playing that quite a

780
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,560
bit, which is pretty cool. I'm assuming this is also tying in with the brand new movie that came

781
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,880
out. Obviously I think that the timing is a little convenient for that. That's for sure.

782
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:24,680
Do you have to pay for that? Cause I you'll have to excuse me, but I have no idea how Roblox works.

783
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,600
Do you have to pay to play this? Or is it like a free ad on like sometimes they do in Minecraft,

784
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,160
like some free downloadable levels that have a little mini games? I think there's stuff that

785
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:37,400
you do have to pay for in the game. I don't remember if it's free. I know my son was saying

786
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:45,160
that he had the pay. He bought the game, but I think it was like, you probably buy stuff in the

787
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:51,640
game. Typically all the Roblox games are free and then you buy stuff in game to lock, like

788
01:17:52,840 --> 01:18:02,200
game passes and, you know, skins and stuff like that. Hmm. Interesting. I would say I have to

789
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,960
check it out at some point, but let's be real. I'm not going to install Roblox to check it out. So

790
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:11,960
maybe Fortnite's the one I got talked into recently. Maybe they do a Sonic thing in

791
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,360
Fortnite. I'll check it out there, but I don't know about Roblox.

792
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:20,760
Yeah. I mean like, I don't know. It, it didn't look, it didn't look terrible. And there are

793
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,560
some games in Roblox that are actually very polished. I just never see my kids playing

794
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,200
those. They play usually like, doesn't Roblox kind of have a reputation for like a bunch of

795
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:34,680
like kids, your, your kid's age playing it like, does it, does a 43 year old man really need to

796
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:40,040
be on for Roblox? I feel like, I feel like I don't need to be there. You don't.

797
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,840
That's it. That's good. Yeah. But I would just, I would just want to turn multiplayer off and I

798
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,800
don't even think that's a thing you can do in Roblox. So you know, you can't unnecessarily,

799
01:18:53,800 --> 01:19:00,200
but yeah, it's, it's, I mean, it looks pretty good, you know, like the video looks pretty

800
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:05,640
good of it. All right. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll watch, you know, on your son's inevitable YouTube

801
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:09,320
channel or something. I'll watch it when he's old enough. You know, funny enough, he actually put

802
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:15,880
out a video today. So my son does have a YouTube channel, but he doesn't. Yeah. He doesn't. He

803
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:21,960
deleted all of his videos and he started over cause he, he thought they were dumb. But yeah,

804
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:26,360
he's going to do that a lot as he gets older, as he gets closer and closer. He put out his,

805
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:31,640
like his introduction video and like he has some gameplay of like Roblox and stuff out there. So

806
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:38,200
yeah, he did do that. It's under our gaming. So I don't really have a link to his channel,

807
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:43,160
but like, yeah, he, he put out stuff, but yeah, he does Roblox videos occasionally. He'll make,

808
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:46,680
they used to do like, like little skits and stuff with their friends and stuff.

809
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:51,080
Wow. Like I said, they, he got embarrassed by it or something. And so he just, you know,

810
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:57,480
well, um, that's like, that's like when old tapes of my public access show from high school show up,

811
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,520
it can be a little embarrassing, the stuff I was doing at that age. So.

812
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,800
Yeah. Yeah. So like, I mean, I can link, I guess I could link it in our, our chat here,

813
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,840
but yeah, I'll, I'll do that. And then, um, you can check it out if you want,

814
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,320
but he only has one video up there, but yeah, it's fun.

815
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:16,680
Cool. Cool. All right. Uh, what else do you have? Loki? I think you have another story about, uh,

816
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:25,560
Kojima. Yes. Uh, so Kojima insists that, uh, Kojima productions is still independent,

817
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,960
even though they had posted something, I guess, on their social media with the PlayStation studios

818
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:37,880
banner. Um, so, you know, in the past, even though they have, um, partnered with Sony on different

819
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:43,160
things says, you know, he would post a tweet says, I'm sorry for misunderstanding, but Kojima

820
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:48,040
productions has been, and will continue to be an independent studio, even though, you know,

821
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:53,400
the PlayStation studios, um, logo, they're not sure why he tweeted that out. Why would you

822
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:58,440
read that out? That was, that was a silly little oversight, wouldn't it? Yeah. So.

823
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:05,240
I'm not really sure what that's all about, but, um, cause yeah, cause he tweeted it,

824
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:11,880
just the image with like nothing to go with it. So it's not like, Hey, congratulations. Or Hey,

825
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:15,800
Oh, I think he tweeted because he's got, you know, his game is featured in,

826
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:24,760
in that PlayStation studios, um, image because it's got a tiny little bit of Norman Reedus and

827
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:31,080
his fetus look corner there. Um, do you think, I don't know. I'm assuming that's why, do you

828
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,600
think we're going to see whatever Kojima is working on next this year, at least some type

829
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,520
of cryptic trailer that doesn't say a thing at summer game best, because, you know, it's been

830
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:43,000
a couple of years. Death Stranding came out right before the pandemic started because it was really

831
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,720
oddly like scary how much like the parallels were to the pandemic. I remember we talked at length

832
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:53,000
about that when that game first came out and okay, sure. Yeah. They had the, you know, remastered

833
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,400
redone edition for PlayStation five and PC that had like the slightly established be real the

834
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:02,040
entire team's resources were not dedicated to the death Stranding, you know, gold edition or

835
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:06,120
whatever it was called. So what's the team really been working on, you know, and of course,

836
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,720
insert your Silent Hill rumor here, but at least, at least for better or for worse,

837
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:15,240
we could find out what have the fuck they're working on. So at least the Silent Hill rumors

838
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:20,040
could stop if, if maybe they would announce whatever they're working on this summer.

839
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,360
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I'd be curious. I think it will be a scary game though. I,

840
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:31,000
and you know, whether Silent Hill or not, I'm all for a Kojima scary game. I hope that they do,

841
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,800
you know, at some sort of announcement, I'm assuming something with Jeff Keeley

842
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:40,520
is going to be involved with. Yeah. That's why I specifically say summer game Fest, because I mean,

843
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:46,520
Kojima and, uh, uh, Jeff Keeley have quite the bromance going on, which is cool. I mean,

844
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:52,600
yeah, that's fine. So at least we, we know what to expect, although we should never

845
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:59,560
set our expectations too high, I guess. Right. Uh, yes. One thing I'm going to set my expectations

846
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:06,040
at a reasonable level for is the latest Niantic game, which was unveiled this week. Um, you know,

847
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:10,200
uh, Niantic hasn't had a new game in a while. We've heard of other projects that they're

848
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:16,440
involved with like the transformers game. Um, but otherwise Niantic has Pokemon go. Of course,

849
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:22,440
Ingress is still going and Pikmin bloom is still going as well. Uh, but now there's going to be

850
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:27,640
another Niantic game and this does seem to unlike the transformers thing, which I think is more

851
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:34,040
Niantic's wayfarer network in somebody else's game. Um, this is going to be a Niantic original

852
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:39,240
because it is a Niantic original IP, which is also interesting because that means this is Niantic's

853
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:45,640
first fully original game since Ingress, the first one, which many people still don't even know about

854
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:51,000
because they're playing Pokemon go or Pikmin. The game was announced this week and it's called

855
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:58,360
Niantic Peridot. Uh, I assume it's like the gem and not Peridot. I guess it could be either way.

856
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:04,440
Uh, but for now I'm going to say Peridot. Uh, so, uh, Peridot is breeding and caring for

857
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:13,320
virtual pets. And immediately my brain is like, yo, Niantic, it is going to be so easy for the

858
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:18,600
lazy journalists and tweeters out there of which there are a lot of them to just say, oh, this is

859
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:26,840
Pokemon go because Pokemon go is virtual pets. So this is Pokemon go. So Niantic right off the bat

860
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:32,040
by deciding to go this direction for their next game is going to have to do that uphill battle

861
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:38,440
of making sure it is obvious how this game is different from the outset, because I guarantee it,

862
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:45,960
I'm calling it now before a single review of this game comes out, every single one of them will

863
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:52,520
compare it to Pokemon go. Even if the game has nothing to do with it outside of the, um,

864
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:57,000
Poke stops and the literal places where, where points of interest are located.

865
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:03,640
The setup for the game is that the dots. So maybe it is Peridot. I look at it and think like a

866
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:08,280
Peridot, but maybe it is Peridot because they're called dots for short. Uh, they've been asleep for

867
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:15,320
thousands of years and, uh, you feed, play and explore with your dot to raise them to adulthood.

868
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,960
When you're out on walks, your dot might find hidden treasures. That sounds a little bit like

869
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:25,080
Pikmin. Uh, you can diversify the species of your dots by working with other players.

870
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,320
It sounds a little more like Tamagotchi or something. I think is what a lot of people

871
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:33,800
are kind of calling it right now. I was definitely getting that kind of vibe. Yeah.

872
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:41,400
So, um, but again, I think there's a lot in Pokemon that looks like, especially with the

873
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:47,960
buddy system that looks like Tamagotchi. So, you know, they gotta be careful. So, uh, Peridot is

874
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,800
said to be, and I guess it is Peridot that an orange eye in chat is telling me it is Peridot

875
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:58,360
and not like the gem. So fair enough. Um, Peridot is in a soft launch period and it's only going to

876
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:03,720
be in select markets at first Niantic almost always tests this stuff in Australia, New Zealand

877
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:08,120
first. So if you're in Australia, New Zealand, I would bet dimes to dollars. You'll get to play

878
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:13,240
this before anyone else. And sometimes they pick other regions as well. Um, I think Canada had one

879
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:19,720
of them early, so it just, it just depends, but the U S won't be one of them. So there's that,

880
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:25,160
uh, you can sign up at the official website. If you want play peridot.com, uh, if you want to sign

881
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,920
up and there's a cute little trailer, you can watch as well, where you certainly start to see

882
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:33,800
a lot more of Niantic's AR things and what they want to develop with that. But again, it's a

883
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:39,320
little early for me. I play all of Niantic's bullshit, all of it for better or for worse.

884
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:43,880
I've played Ingress way too long. I was playing it today. In fact, cause there was a big event

885
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:49,160
this weekend. So I played that to get my badge. Pokemon go. I still play here and there. Pikmin

886
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:55,080
bloom. I'm just shy of level 54 in Pikmin bloom. I didn't even know it could go. Apparently it goes

887
01:26:55,080 --> 01:27:00,120
up to a hundred. Uh, so there's still a long way to go and Pikmin bloom. Uh, I played the Harry

888
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:07,160
Potter game for a hot minute until, um, that woman kind of ruined everything Harry Potter for me.

889
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:11,080
Um, but the, and the game was a little bit reductive with Pokemon go. So it was kind of,

890
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:16,200
you know, it kind of, it kind of got old faster and obviously it's gone now, but I did try it.

891
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:20,280
And, you know, I've tried derivatives, even if they're not Niantic games, I've tried things like

892
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:26,120
Orna, which is, you know, different, but still, you know, AR in a way. So, uh, yeah, so there's,

893
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:31,000
I try them all. It's just, I'm a sucker for those mobile AR games and using the real world as a,

894
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,880
as a game board is very interesting to me. So I wish the Catan thing had happened. I'd still

895
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:40,200
like to know what the fuck happened there. Yeah. I like Catan. I would have played that.

896
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,720
Yeah. Well, and people did play Catan in Australia, New Zealand,

897
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:49,720
cause it never came out of the testing phase after that. So it's weird. Anyway, we'll see

898
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,880
more information. I, you know, the minute it does come out in some region, it'll be all over Reddit.

899
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:58,840
So stay tuned. Anyhow, in the meantime, we're going to get to listener round table,

900
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:04,520
your chat questions, your discord calls at vog network.com slash discord and your emails

901
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:10,200
of which we have one to get to tonight. So let me get to it. I just need to bring it up here.

902
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:19,800
Sorry. I was not prepared because usually there's a third person here to help with some of this.

903
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,520
Um, do you have a last minute story for us maybe to help?

904
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:30,680
I've been looking for a last minute story. So there's just not a lot this week. So slow weeks.

905
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:34,200
Okay. Yeah. I don't have a last minute story. That's all right. We bought enough time talking

906
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:38,200
about, we need time. Uh, we have our, for our one and only email tonight. Participate

907
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:41,560
at orange launch radio.com is the place for you to send an email for a future week.

908
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:49,480
Tonight's email from Y Y R. Hello all are in lieu of this week's scheduled tangents and drag race

909
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:54,200
talk. I've decided to send an email to everyone disappointed at this turn of events. I'm truly

910
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:58,120
sorry. That's okay. I'm not even watching really the season of drag race, just following it on

911
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:04,360
social media. Last week's show led off with mention of Zoltar. While I must admit, I most definitely

912
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:09,160
see one of these coin operated Zoltar fortune time machines. I will also take this opportunity

913
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:14,200
to plug an entirely different Zoltar. He is one of my favorite DJs, spinning trance, vocal trance,

914
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:19,560
and associated energy pick packed music. He actually has a weekly podcast subterranean that

915
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:24,120
he has been running for quite a number of years now. And if all goes right, he should be hitting

916
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:30,120
episode a thousand later this year. Hey, that's a long time. If this sounds good to you and you're

917
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:36,120
caught up on OLR, do a search for a mix cloud Zoltar. That's Z O L T A R. I love that he

918
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,000
spelled it out in the email and you will find gobs of two hour sets waiting for you. Enjoy. Thank you.

919
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:47,880
Forza Horizon 5 came up in conversation, specifically a conversation about DLC. Yes,

920
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:52,760
Forza Horizon 5 does already have plenty of DLC. And ultimately it looks like it will have the same

921
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:58,520
DLC that Forza Horizon 4 did. There is already a car pass. Folks who purchased it are getting 34

922
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:03,960
new cars, one each week that are exclusive to owners of the DLC. It costs $30 if purchased

923
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:08,920
alone, but most of the cars will be available separately. There will also be two game expansions

924
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:14,520
released likely over the next 18 months for $20 each. Yes, it's following the similar formula

925
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:19,480
of the last games. There is VIP membership, which doubles the in-game credits earned,

926
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:25,160
gives you two free super wheel spins per week and a few exclusive items which cost $20 by itself.

927
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:30,600
But you can get all of the above for $50 or $45 if you have game pass, which makes it an easier

928
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:35,480
pill to swallow. That's probably the Bobby Black Wolf edition. I'm guessing that he bought because

929
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:39,800
I know he spent extra money on the game. And I'm going to assume that is like all the types of

930
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:46,680
loot that you get when you buy the game, even if you already have game pass.

931
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,920
And then of course, yes, you can buy the treasure map for $3,

932
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:56,360
which reveals the locations of all the hidden bonus boards, barn finds and other secret locations.

933
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:01,080
So all in all, the game has a lot of DLC for sure. But if you play the game as much as I do,

934
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:06,440
which is to say for hundreds of hours, then it feels worth it. And one reason fans of the game

935
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:10,520
don't seem to have much of a problem with this setup is because the in-game currency cannot be

936
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:15,480
purchased. And the game typically throws cars at you like a pitcher throws baseballs. In other

937
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:21,000
words, it feels like the DLC gives you something extra on top of your full game, rather than giving

938
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,880
you something that should have been in the game to begin with. I agree with that point. And that's

939
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:30,440
maybe what makes the DLC feel a little more invisible, I suppose.

940
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:39,080
Bobby Blackwolf wants to clarify, I have the $100 version, which is like the $45 pass. But I also

941
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:44,760
own the game if I ever cancel game pass, which I don't see Bobby Blackwolf doing that for a long

942
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:49,640
time. But before Forza Horizon 6 is out, but we'll see. We'll see. You never know, right?

943
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:56,280
So anyhow, more good stuff in this email from YYR. And then there was talk of Intellivision

944
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:06,440
Amico. Sigh. Cosigned on that sentence. Sigh. Honestly, my theory on it is that even if COVID

945
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:10,600
hadn't happened, it would still be exactly where it is now, but with different excuses.

946
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:15,720
My reasoning is that if you look at the Gamescom trailer that was shown back in August 2019,

947
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:19,720
and compare its short gameplay clips with all the videos released last year and this year,

948
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:23,400
you'll see the same games in the same state, meaning virtually nothing has been done with

949
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:28,280
them since then. It's a known fact that these games were all made in Unity, so it's not like

950
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:32,760
the hardware needed to be final and in production before more work can be done on them. And the deep

951
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:37,480
dive videos released last year were just awful, serving little purpose aside from showing how

952
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:41,560
shallow the games were in their current state. It's truly a shame because I was part of the

953
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:45,960
target market for this thing, and I even wanted to develop games for it. But it has clearly been

954
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,520
mishandled at every possible level, and if they think they can now turn around, finish it, and

955
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:56,280
then release it at the same price point as Nintendo Switch, they are plain old nuts. I don't think I

956
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:06,440
have a lot to add to what YYR is saying there. Whatever the reason is, whether it's that they

957
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:11,640
got screwed by the part people overseas or whatever, it's in a bad place right now,

958
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:16,920
and it doesn't look good. So, I mean, I will hope that they turn it around, but at the same time,

959
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:21,960
I will still buy the console myself because it's going to be one of those, it's so bad,

960
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,920
it's good things. It's going to be like the CDI of this decade. Watch.

961
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:34,200
BobbyBlackWolf also clarifying, five can be taken off Game Pass. Remember that Forza Horizon 4 is

962
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:41,880
off of Game Pass now. Fair point. And Bobby does say, we'll never know if they would have failed

963
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:47,400
the same way if there was no pandemic, and that's fair too. Now, here's the other interesting part

964
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,960
of YYR's email, and he saves this for the last paragraph, and I kind of think this is really

965
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:56,680
backloading your email. You didn't front load your email, you backloaded your email.

966
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:00,600
He should have said this at the start, in my opinion, but I will pay this paragraph

967
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:05,880
special attention. I would mention that I just released a game on Xbox,

968
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:12,040
but I've already rambled for too long. So, I'll just say you should go to YYR Games if you want

969
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:16,280
to see what I've been up to. YYRgames.com, excuse me, if you want to see what I've been up to.

970
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:22,520
Thanks again for the show, and have a great week. Always talking too much, Aaron. YYR.

971
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,560
So, don't you love that, that YYR just sneaked in the news, hey, I stealth relief the game on

972
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:35,960
Xbox this week, enjoy. Well, YYR, guess what? I actually looked at the emails ahead of the show

973
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:45,640
this week, and I have my trusty Xbox Series X controller right here. So, let me push the button,

974
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:52,760
and I apologize I don't have the right shots loaded, but since I have my personal stream

975
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:58,920
shots available, at least for the Twitch folks, I can show you what's on my Xbox right now.

976
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:08,200
And you'll notice that for the low, low price of $2.99, I picked up a copy of Falling Plus,

977
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:16,040
which is available now on Xbox Series X, and I believe it's available on PC as well.

978
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:21,720
And you'll notice it's a YYR game. Of course, this is the one that's inspired by

979
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:30,120
classic, it's got the pengo thing going on there, and it looks like a classic 80s game, basically.

980
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:35,720
And it has the Xbox Live leaderboards. There's one person on the main leaderboard right now,

981
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:41,320
so more of you need to pick this game up. I played before the show, but I had to quit because

982
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:46,120
the show was about to start and I wasn't dying, so I did not make the leaderboard myself.

983
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:51,080
But yeah, there it is, Falling Plus is on Xbox. And I assume, and Aaron's talked about this before

984
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:59,720
on the show, this must be through that new XNA kind of reborn thing he was getting into,

985
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:05,240
because one thing I did notice was that like the XNA games, there are no achievements with this

986
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:10,600
game, which is fine. But if you are an achievement whore, you're not going to find them. But I also

987
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:17,960
want to remind you, the game is $2.99. So it's still a great value. You'll notice there's still

988
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:22,920
lots of extras in here, including Arcade Mode, Survival Challenge, the Burning Igloo Challenge,

989
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:31,480
and so on and so on. So anyhow, there you go, Aaron, I got you by actually reading the emails

990
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:37,160
before the show tonight. And there it is, Falling Plus is now available on Xbox. I believe it is on

991
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:44,760
the PC, Microsoft Marketplace as well. Somebody may need to follow up with me to confirm that,

992
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:52,040
because I only looked on my Xbox Series X, but I think it's there. ZenMonkey11 in chat says,

993
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:57,400
I'm going to use my Xbox to get this. Now you all know why I said earlier, if you have $10 sitting

994
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:02,200
in your account, I know something you can spend some of that money on that would be very worthy

995
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:07,480
for a long time OLR supporter here. And sg100matt says, this is one of my favorite YYR games.

996
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:12,360
Now, I think it's a great game. I love all of Aaron's stuff. And I hope this is a really

997
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:17,320
good sign for his other stuff, getting some exposure on Xbox. I will also ask you one thing

998
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:20,840
I should point out. We have extra time tonight, whatever. I do see somebody in the green room,

999
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:28,200
and I apologize to that person. I will get to you shortly. But one thing I do want to point out

1000
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:34,360
that was pretty cool about this is that if I actually go to the store on the Xbox Marketplace,

1001
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:42,920
and I actually search, and I search for, crap, I have to turn off my, I can't see around my giant

1002
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:51,800
head. Hold on. There we go. If I actually search for falling, not fall out, and not fall, so you

1003
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:58,680
have to actually go into like falling space plus, but there it is, it is in the store.

1004
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:05,720
So the nice thing is, I remember when this was on Xbox 360, when this game was originally out,

1005
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:11,560
you had to go into like that separate store, that separate XNA store to find it. But you don't have

1006
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:18,280
to do that here. It's actually here available just within the storefront. And it's actually,

1007
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:24,440
it's also been rated E for everyone. Isn't that cute? So that's pretty cool. I love that it

1008
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:32,840
actually has the full storefront available. It is presented in 4K Ultra HD with its retro graphics,

1009
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:37,800
but congrats to YYR. That's amazing. Those pixels are extra sharp.

1010
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:43,000
Those pictures are extra sharp, but I think that's really exciting. I'm really excited and happy for

1011
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:49,560
YYR with that. So there you go. Bobby Blackwell says, going down to my theater. So look at that.

1012
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:53,880
Thank you, YYR. Thank you. I will take my check next week on the show. No, just kidding. I'm

1013
01:38:53,880 --> 01:39:00,840
kidding. I do that because he's a friend of mine and I want to support his stuff. He has made OLR

1014
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:08,440
dream games come true. I will always owe him for that. So, all right. Thank you, YYR. Now, Loki,

1015
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:16,040
the next question is Pixel Poops number two on Xbox Win. Oh gosh, that'd be like,

1016
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:22,840
that'd have to be a whole nother game. I don't think I can port an NES game to the Xbox.

1017
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,800
I'm sure you could do it with emulators. You don't think someone's done like an S-Maker shell

1018
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:31,800
for Xbox type of thing? No, I don't think for a shell per se, but they've done like emulators,

1019
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:37,400
but that's kind of like a gray area. Like they don't want emulators on there. So like you'd

1020
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:43,160
have to rewrite the whole thing, which honestly I'd probably be easier anyways. It's like getting

1021
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:47,960
it to run just the way you'd want it. But yeah, it'd have to be a whole different thing.

1022
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:52,360
SSU 100 Matt, thank you for getting the clip there. And please, please text that to Aaron.

1023
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:58,520
So that he can see it before he listens to the show. All right. Uh, we have somebody who's been

1024
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:03,160
very patiently waiting in the green room to come on the show. So let's get to the call. Hi, you're

1025
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:08,600
on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, Hey, Hey, what's going on, everybody? Hey, Rama,

1026
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:13,960
how you doing? It's good to see you. I'm good. I'm just glad I got my computer back up and running

1027
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:18,440
before I was able before, you know, I was able to jump in and chill out in the green room again for

1028
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:23,640
a few minutes. It's it's very good to see you here tonight. And yeah, I'm glad I'm glad you're able

1029
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:29,640
to get everything worked out there in the green room. So because right before, you know, you

1030
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:35,880
pulled me in. I actually knocked power to my entire apartment. Whoops. Oh, no, don't do that.

1031
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:41,960
Yeah, I had the heater going because it got a little cold. I turned on the microwave to fix

1032
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:50,200
my dinner. And then I'm just like, the lights when I was just like, Oh, oh, oh, all right.

1033
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:55,960
What's on your mind tonight, my friend? Talk about how awesome game passes real talk. Now,

1034
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:02,600
I have gotten pushback from people about, you know, PlayStation Game Pass and

1035
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:10,840
Microsoft Game Pass. Now, all that aside, I look at it this way. For the top tier,

1036
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:19,400
you get access to all these classic PlayStation one, PlayStation two games that you can download

1037
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:27,000
and play or stream. Even if you already own the game on your PS one and your PS two,

1038
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:34,120
you still have to pay this extra to download that version and start your game from scratch.

1039
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:41,080
Whereas, you know, Microsoft's like, Oh, you have this game. Let's get you to updated version.

1040
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:48,600
We good. We got you. Now, one thing I love about game passes, I can just download all these games

1041
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:57,000
and just play them and see if I like them or not. And you get these great discounts on the games as

1042
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:03,400
well. And you know, when you turn on your Xbox, you're like, Oh, check out these cool games. And

1043
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:10,120
that's what I did. There was this game I kept seeing on sale for the last, I say month,

1044
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:16,120
month and a half called Chris tales. And I looked at some of the videos. I was just like, I don't

1045
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:21,880
know. I don't know if this is a game I want to play, but it was on game pass. And I'm like,

1046
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:27,240
you know what? I'm going to give it a try. And you know, I started playing it and I'm like,

1047
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:32,600
you know what? I actually liked this game. This game's pretty awesome.

1048
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:42,040
Let's see how much it is. $19.99 for digital download. Okay, fine. I decided, you know what,

1049
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:50,440
let me check for a physical copy. Just, just because found it on Amazon for 10 bucks. So

1050
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:55,880
that day I downloaded Chris tales and played it for about two hours and said how much I really

1051
01:42:55,880 --> 01:43:02,600
enjoyed it within half hour after that went on Amazon ordered the game and had it the next day.

1052
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:11,480
Wow. Okay. So to me, game pass is just like a digital version of blockbuster video. You know,

1053
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:17,560
well, it's Netflix really, you know, it's, we keep talking about the, the switch and trying

1054
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:21,960
to get Nintendo switch online to be the Netflix of gaming. And it's like game pass. That's

1055
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:27,800
literally what game pass is doing. It's Netflix gaming. Now the problem is like Netflix things

1056
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:34,120
disappear. And so you might, you know, like say like me, I was playing final fantasy 12 remastered.

1057
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:38,280
I didn't beat it, but the game's now no longer on game pass. Now I could have bought it. I could

1058
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:43,000
have done what you did, or I could, you know, whether it was through the storefront with a

1059
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,560
discount, whatever digitally, or I could have got it on Amazon, but I didn't. And it's gone now,

1060
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:53,320
but I still feel that I'm still getting a good value out of game pass because at least I got to

1061
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:57,480
try it for as long as I did. And I know that I enjoyed it. And it's kind of like, you know,

1062
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:02,040
you and this game and, and you know, what other people talked about, like Bobby getting forza

1063
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:05,720
horizon and paying for it, even though he's getting it through game pass as well. You know,

1064
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:10,680
it's a good way to like try stuff and, you know, make sure that you will have it

1065
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:18,600
after it gets removed from Netflix of gaming. Yep. This is the game I have picked up like this.

1066
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:23,400
Like there's a game called Scarlet Nexus that was on game pass. It still is. I'm just like,

1067
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:28,280
this is fun. This is a great game. It was on sale during the holidays. I was like,

1068
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:34,520
let me add that to the collection. I'm still playing through the game. The original copy

1069
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:39,720
is still sealed sitting on the shelf next to the 50 plus other games I've bought during the

1070
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:46,360
pandemic because it was on sale and I'm like, I'll get to it. And in reality, yeah, I will probably

1071
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:50,600
get to it when I have to take a personal day from work and just kind of go through some of these

1072
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:58,360
games. But Rob, if Final Fantasy 12, if it's a good deal on Amazon, let's say you see it for like

1073
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:04,680
under 20 bucks, will you pull the trigger on it? Probably, but you know, you know, you've,

1074
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:10,200
you've been listening to my ass rant about games long enough to know that I get distracted by other

1075
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:15,320
stuff all the time, including going back to this MMO that I've been playing forever,

1076
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:21,960
going back to always content going game like No Man's Sky. It's very hard to me to fit it

1077
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:27,480
into the schedule to go back to Final Fantasy 12. But I think it's a great game and I'd love to pick

1078
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:31,720
it up. There's a part of me that wonders, maybe they'll release it again on PlayStation five and

1079
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:36,600
series x, who knows? I don't know anything's possible. But yeah, if I if I saw it on a deep

1080
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:40,760
discount, I might be tempted, it would probably be one of those things where it's like, my husband

1081
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:44,840
convinces me to actually go in a GameStop because he does that occasionally, like we'll be eating

1082
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:48,120
at a place next door. And he's like, let's just go and GameStop and see what they have. And then

1083
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:52,760
I see it in the bin for like five bucks. And I'll probably be like, I can't say no to that. Let's

1084
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:58,680
get it. That's usually how it goes. Yeah, exactly. Because what you had mentioned,

1085
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:05,000
FF 12, you talked about the different Final Fantasies. I'm like, I never finished 13.

1086
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:14,680
Because the week that I bought it, my roommate sat down and turned his fiance into a gamer widow

1087
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:17,720
and just finish that game within a month. And it's like,

1088
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:25,880
okay, all all three, all the Final Fantasy 13 games are on game pass right now.

1089
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:30,600
Yeah, the thing is, I went out and bought them for PlayStation three. I'm like, you know what,

1090
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:36,920
I'm going to play on PS three and go through them. Now that my PlayStation three sound sounds like

1091
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,480
a janky shuttle rocket when you turn it on. I'm like, yeah, no, I'm going to wait.

1092
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:49,960
Now that I see that it's on game pass, because I was originally going to buy the 360 ones and just

1093
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:58,120
do the upgrade button. You know what, that just takes me $45. Yep. And it's it plays best on

1094
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:03,240
series x than anywhere else. Because the loading times getting eliminated is huge for the game.

1095
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:10,280
And the cutscenes being re rendered in 720 means the game, you know, I PC is comparable, I suppose,

1096
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:17,800
but series runs the game extremely well. Most definitely, you know, because it's like,

1097
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:24,840
I realize that I've been giving so much love and attention to my series x that I've come to the

1098
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:32,120
conclusion. I don't want a PlayStation five. I can wait a little bit longer. There's only like two

1099
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:38,520
games on there that I want Horizon Forbidden West and remake integrate, you know,

1100
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:45,800
Forbidden West is on PS four, to be fair. I have a feeling you're going to drop remake

1101
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:52,120
integrated for PS four as well. It's going to happen. I'm just gonna wait. I'm in no rush.

1102
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:58,360
That and if you see where my series is in my entertainment cabinet, there's barely enough

1103
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:03,480
room for the PlayStation five or how tall that sucker is. Definitely a redesign, please.

1104
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:09,800
Yeah, I'm hoping a redesign is in the future. That's for sure. So and yeah,

1105
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:13,560
Bobby is saying there's nothing in the iffy DLC that requires the PlayStation five. Yeah,

1106
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:17,880
I kind of heard that too. It's just it's just a thing to get people on that system.

1107
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:23,880
I hope the remake comes out for Xbox, though, just for completion sake, but I get it. They've

1108
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:28,200
Sony's paying them money, and they're getting good for it. So then it's understandable.

1109
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:35,160
It's just two words. Eye candy. Let's be real. They release it for PC. So it's just a matter

1110
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:43,080
of time before it hits Xbox, you know, so come on. But this summer will be a year since that DLC

1111
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:50,120
came out for PS five. So if they don't do more DLC this year, maybe the Xbox will get its release

1112
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:53,400
this year if it's going to get it but I'm not I'm not going to get my hopes up. It is what it is.

1113
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:59,000
I'll get around to it eventually. For sure. Anything else on your night on your mind tonight,

1114
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:05,720
my friend? Ah, halo the TV series. Oh, yeah, I haven't watched that. How's that?

1115
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,520
Okay, let me I'm gonna say this because this is what I'm reading in your face.

1116
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:19,880
There's an amazing drag queen out there named says I get to talk about drag queens with the emails.

1117
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:27,080
There's an amazing drag queen named Tatiana out there. And when she watched another contestant do

1118
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:33,080
a really bad routine during the talent show and all stars too. She said to the camera, she goes,

1119
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:38,520
you know, in life, we get to make a lot of choices. And that that was a choice.

1120
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:47,560
Now, I understand when there is an adaptation of something sometimes it's a call as part of

1121
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:52,520
the universal whatever it is. Okay, fine. I want to take for example, Sailor Moon,

1122
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:56,600
you have classic, you have crystal, you have the deke dub, and they're like,

1123
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:01,080
pick whatever one you want. It still makes sense to you. It's still part of the quote unquote

1124
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:06,600
universe, whichever one it is. It's all good. You got it. Halo on the other hand.

1125
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,560
Let's say this is the whole this is the Lord Halo.

1126
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,560
No.

1127
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:22,680
Rama had a big book he was holding up. And then he just threw it behind his shoulder. So I have to

1128
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:28,840
they didn't play the games at all. From what I hear. They just said, Oh, well, we'll just

1129
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:31,960
adapt the characters without knowing anything about him. It sounds like

1130
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:39,640
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you this now. You're not going to like of how they put the UNSC. But

1131
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:47,080
if you can make it through the first episode, it gets better. You just got to make it past

1132
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:50,760
the first episode. And if you don't, I do not blame you.

1133
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:57,160
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the good news about the Halo series is game pass has a 30 day

1134
01:50:57,160 --> 01:51:01,480
Paramount Plus free trial. So we might be pulling the trigger on that just to see if we can justify

1135
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:07,560
it. Ask your friend in California to borrow the login because he rarely logs in just saying funny,

1136
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:10,200
if you really want to watch it. There's ways to make that happen.

1137
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:15,000
You can watch all the Star Trek to while you're at it. So

1138
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:23,640
on if you want, I think worth it's worth the time. So anyway, yeah, thank you for the review

1139
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:33,240
of the Halo TV show. So Loki, have you been watching it? No, no, no. All right. I check.

1140
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:39,160
I just hope that you know, now that video game TV shows are becoming all the rage. Thanks to

1141
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:43,720
Castlevania. Thanks to the Witcher. Yes, I know the Witcher was a book. But let's be real,

1142
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:48,120
the games are what made that TV show. Because of all this stuff getting turned into TV shows.

1143
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:52,600
Please, please consult the source material because I'm saying they're supposed to be doing a show

1144
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:57,560
about Final Fantasy 14. And I'm not talking about the dad of light. I'm talking about the actual

1145
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:13,560
fantasy 14 show. Do not fuck that up. Do not fuck that up. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. It's not even

1146
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:22,040
Rama. Rama. Rama. Rama. Rama. I'm gonna call I'm gonna call you Adam. Adam. Yes, yes. Here's the

1147
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:27,240
thing you have been you may not play the game yourself. But you have been to enough anime

1148
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:35,480
conventions. You have seen enough M itself. You have seen enough cosplay from 14. You have seen

1149
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:45,880
enough the fandom, you know, my friend, the makers that show better not fuck it up. Mr. Roberts,

1150
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:53,080
sir, my liege. I understand. Remember, there was Final Fantasy The spirits within

1151
01:52:53,640 --> 01:53:01,640
now. We all know how that went about. But there was an anime called Final Fantasy Unlimited

1152
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:09,000
that came out. Oh, I remember that. It was so bad. It was canceled halfway through

1153
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:14,760
and the last 26 episodes were turned into a colored manga. What does that tell you?

1154
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:23,160
I understand. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Don't the expectations for the show

1155
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:29,480
aren't that high. It's based off of Final Fantasy 14 version one. So you know, it's okay.

1156
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:34,360
I mean, honestly, if I if I want to watch a bad adaptation,

1157
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:38,600
I'll go I'll go grab my art of fighting anime every watch it. Okay.

1158
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:43,320
I'll go I'll go watch Double Dragon the movie.

1159
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:50,120
I will say this much. I saw that in the theaters. I liked it for what it was.

1160
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:56,360
But I'd sooner watch Double Dragon over DOA or the King of Fighters movie. Okay.

1161
01:53:56,360 --> 01:54:01,640
They're there. You know, it's funny as I asked him about Double Dragon when he came into our

1162
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:06,840
work that one time I can't remember the guy's name was Scott Wolf. Scott Wolf. Yeah. Are you

1163
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:11,800
our work? Yeah. Party five guy. Yeah. So he came into my old job because, you know,

1164
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:17,400
we used to sell games and stuff like that. So yeah, we did ask him about Double Dragon and

1165
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:22,360
stuff. And he thought it was all right. But like, you know, he knows what it was.

1166
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:28,440
There's you remember actors are just like you and me. Right. And for a lot of them,

1167
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:34,840
it's a paycheck. It's a job. You know what? Hey, that movie was a turd. But it bought me this

1168
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:39,720
house. Like I literally saw somebody say that in an interview. That movie sucked. But it bought

1169
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:51,880
me this house. The man speaking is speaking the gospel. I mean, who really won? We all lost,

1170
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:57,160
but the actors won. That's fine. It's fine. Oh, yeah. Bobby Blackwell. Jeremy Irons said

1171
01:54:57,160 --> 01:55:03,320
about that nineties Dungeons and Dragons movie. I had a castle to pay off. Oh God,

1172
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:09,640
I actually forgot about that. Oh, yes. And I was excited about that movie too. We all were

1173
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:19,080
anyway. Let's be real. The best nineties movie adaptation was Mortal Kombat. Okay. That was it.

1174
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:23,800
During the nineties, Mortal Kombat set the standard and everything else just hit the wall.

1175
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:28,840
I liked Silent Hill, but that was the odds. That was the next decade, I suppose. But I thought the

1176
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:35,160
Silent Hill movie was pretty good for a video. I like that. I'd be, I would be really interested

1177
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:42,280
for them to revisit Silent Hill today, actually. And I don't understand why we, I mean, they

1178
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,720
stopped making shitty sequels, right? They only did the one sequel and they didn't do any after

1179
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:49,000
that. Like they kept threatening to, but they didn't do it right. I think that's something

1180
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,840
they should explore in a TV show, but what do I know? I'm just a schmo with a podcast.

1181
01:55:52,840 --> 01:56:00,840
Good TV show. But again, consult the source material, please, before adapting it for a TV

1182
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:09,320
show. But maybe, okay, conversely, a lot of people reacting very positively to the Sonic movie,

1183
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:16,760
right? But why is the Sonic movie so good? Because the guy that directed it like has an affinity for

1184
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:22,120
the Sonic franchise and worked on the Dreamcast game or something, right? Like did some of the

1185
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:26,840
full motion video capture for some of the old Sonic games. So it's like, they knew the source

1186
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:31,480
material. This was not somebody that was just trying to do Sonic cause, Oh, my kid likes that.

1187
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:37,880
See now that's another one. Sonic, the Sonic movies. I like to call based on the Sonic

1188
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:42,360
universes because you had Saturday morning, Sonic, which was based off the Archie comics

1189
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:48,360
and its own universe. You had Sonic X, which was its own universe, the Sonic OVAs. And then you

1190
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:55,720
had the Sonic games, the movies pulled from the more recent games and then kind of went on its

1191
01:56:55,720 --> 01:57:01,800
own little path. And that's what I liked. It got the great elements of everything and it went on

1192
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:09,320
its own path, you know, like welcome to green Hills, you know, that was great. Robotnik in

1193
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:15,640
that mushroom zone, which was a planet. That was great. I forgot about some of the lore from the

1194
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:20,760
games that they brought in. I'm like, this is good, you know? So I like where they're going

1195
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:25,880
with it, you know? All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show,

1196
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:30,840
but it is always fantastic to hear you Rama. And I hope people are listening on Tuesdays for anime

1197
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:36,440
jam session, where we can hear about all the cosplay, all the terrible anime, and most

1198
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:43,400
importantly, all the drama happening at anime conventions near you. That will be this Tuesday

1199
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:48,200
when we talk when we finally get around to talking about Zenkai con 2022 fun con a little

1200
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:53,960
chaotic, but you know, we survived all the good things are. All right, my friend. Take care. Great

1201
01:57:53,960 --> 01:58:00,520
to talk to you. Have a good night. Bye bye. All right, the one and only DJ Rama s here on orange

1202
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:05,400
launch radio. With that, I think we're gonna wrap things up for the night. Loki, did you have any

1203
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:09,880
last minute stories you want to get out? No, I didn't have anything. Well, then how about a final

1204
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:14,040
thought before we get to that? I'll say thank you as always for listening to orange launch radio,

1205
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:18,200
whether this was your first episode or your 900th. Appreciate you guys. I'll be in here.

1206
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:22,680
I suppose we have to start talking about the 20th year show and figure out what we want to do for

1207
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:26,360
that. I just realized that six that's like six weeks away, maybe. No, that'd be the beginning

1208
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:31,560
of June six weeks away. So we're like 10 weeks away from all ours 20th anniversary,

1209
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:38,680
which is pretty wild. So yeah, anyway, be thinking about that. Thank you for being here with orange

1210
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:42,040
launch radio. Tell a friend about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where

1211
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,920
every gamer has a voice. But we could use some more voices here to get all of the your opinions

1212
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:52,440
and things out on air and all that good stuff. Oh, thanks for the reminder. Matt packs East is this

1213
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:56,120
week. I don't know if we'll get a lot of announcements for PAX East. It's not usually

1214
01:58:56,120 --> 01:59:01,640
that kind of show. But the panels. Sometimes the developers can't keep their mouth shut in those

1215
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:08,120
panels. There might be a little things that trickle out of that. Maybe any stuff to move fun. So also,

1216
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:13,160
a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, Google Play, wherever you found this

1217
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:18,520
podcast. Five star review goes a long way. So thank you as always for those. And please consider

01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:30,920
discord. That is otherwise going to do it. Dark soccer will be with me next week. And we'll hear

1220
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:38,200
all about a trip this weekend. Otherwise, we won't have Loki but we wish you well. Thank you. Please

1221
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:42,600
update me via text so I can let the listeners know. But I'm sure everything's gonna go great.

1222
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:47,560
So yeah, I'm hoping it goes great. And I'm enjoying gonna enjoy my week off

1223
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:53,560
from work. Enjoy it. Have a nice daycation. Hopefully, you get some good pills. So

1224
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:56,200
Loki, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

1225
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:02,680
No, just basically go sub to my YouTube channel if you haven't yet. I just want to get to 500

1226
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:06,600
subs so that I can actually use their community features. Oh, nice. It's so stupid that the gate

1227
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:10,920
that stuff behind subscriptions, but it'd be nice to be able to post like, you know,

1228
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:14,760
text posts saying, Hey, here's what I'm working on that type of stuff. But can't do that until

1229
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:21,320
like 500 subs. I don't know. It's dumb. All right. And my final thought is I'll plug my

1230
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:26,440
personal Twitch channel at Rob Roberts because I'm trying to work on getting more follows for

1231
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:32,520
in advance of TwitchCon later this year and working on my No Man's Sky playthrough. I'm

1232
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:36,120
actually going to do that again later tonight. Well after the show, I'm not going to do it

1233
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:40,200
immediately after the show. Like Jamie usually does her thing because I like physically can't.

1234
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:45,960
But later tonight, I'll get into that. And also I'm streaming more Final Fantasy 14 and getting

1235
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:51,640
into PVP this week. So hope to see you there. So thanks for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

1236
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:55,560
When we all come together, we have a great time. Thanks for being here and we'll see you in seven

1237
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:58,920
