0	14520	The standout story this week is Bungie pursuing fraudsters. A malicious party created fraudulent
14520	19080	DMCA requests purporting to be Bungie's legal partner in order to take down legitimate Destiny
19080	23200	2 content creator YouTube videos, and Bungie wants to bust those abusers. I'm in favor
23200	27560	of the DMCA in theory, but implementing it affects nearly every party in the process,
27560	31360	and we see nearly all of that in this story. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,
31360	34200	Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you details on this and the rest of the week's gaming
34200	40160	news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
40160	46240	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
46240	53040	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode
53040	60960	number 908 of our show for April the 3rd of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined
60960	65160	every week here with my co-host. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
65160	68400	Oh, hi. Hi. Good to see you again.
68400	77800	Yeah, well, I bought a $120 webcam for 45 bucks on Mercari brand new.
77800	79560	Hooray for sales.
79560	85920	Well, or however this person managed to get a hold of it and sell it, I asked no questions.
85920	86920	It's a nice Logitech.
86920	89360	Yeah, you look great. So good to see you again.
89360	95800	It's a 1080. I mean, I prefer the 4K of my iPhone, you know, but, and the skin editor
95800	96800	on camo.
96800	101960	It ends up getting shrunk down to a little box when we're taping for OLR anyway.
101960	106400	And I also realized this is going to come in handy for my marathon because my phone
106400	112080	doesn't charge when I'm using camo. So if I'm going to be on 12 hours, I think that's
112080	113080	going to be necessary.
113080	116960	There you go. There you go. And of course I'm talking about some visuals because we
116960	121000	do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice
121000	126760	of geeks network, twitch.tv slash VOG network, VOG network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
126760	131600	show. Also joining me on this program, say hello to tech master Loki.
131600	132600	Hello.
132720	133720	Hello.
133720	138360	Hi, Loki. I'm trying to determine what that game is. It's a very loud, bright game. And
138360	141520	it's not one I recognize. I feel like I should know it.
141520	150280	Yeah, I'm trying to remember what the name was. It's something with a snail. It's, no,
150280	157320	it's called will you snail you, but it has nothing to do with the little creatures. I
157320	160320	don't see those in there. So that's interesting.
160320	164840	It does. It's basically so what's kind of the unique thing about the game is you're
164840	169760	trying it's like a speed run game, but the game has AI and will know how in will know
169760	174600	basically what like how you play and try to trip you up based off of how you play.
174600	178640	Okay, that's a clever mechanic. I'll give it that. Okay. All right. So it's like the
178640	183440	anti speed runner game. I kind of like that. That's sort of good.
183440	186800	I actually have a pretty nasty phobia of snails and slugs, right?
186800	191240	No, yeah, yeah. But it's a very cartoon snail. It doesn't matter. I can't look at them at
191240	196720	all. Like not even the giant racing one from the never ending story.
196720	201760	I only remember the horse getting eaten by the lake in that one.
201760	205600	It reminds me of like number munchress for some reason. Like, I don't know, like, or
205600	211040	like, I don't know, something like that, like an old PC or I don't know.
211040	215760	Yeah, it's got a retro look to it. It's like that retro. But like with modern graphic touches,
215760	219120	it makes me think of this was in the news this week, but it's not on our show world
219120	224160	tonight. So I can mention it. It's the the the doom. You know, that source codes everywhere,
224160	227920	right? Because people have ported Doom from the 1990s to like run on a toaster, right?
227920	232080	We know Doom is everywhere. Somebody got a version of that running on like race trace
232080	236160	with like ray tracing. And that's showing up because like a lot of people are saying
236160	240520	like, wow, it makes Doom look like a crazy like new different game. And that's kind of
240520	244440	like what the gameplay behind you makes you think of because it's just it's a retro game,
244440	251180	but it's got like new flashy elements to it. So sure. Yeah, yeah. So anyhow, um, let's
251180	254720	talk a little bit about our kickoff topic tonight because we are here to talk about
254720	259420	video games with you all in our chat room over twitch.tv slash a vog network. Bobby
259420	265600	Blackwell is there finding the link to the game that is featured on Loki stream there.
265600	273120	And dark soccer is mentioning the 10 ADP pro stream, writing out the tech that she's using.
273120	277800	If you need to get a copy of that for yourself. All right. Um, let's get into tonight's kickoff
277800	284760	topic and it can quite, uh, quite simply be put as nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
284760	290040	nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, hey, goodbye. Uh, e three 2022 is officially canceled. It's
290040	295240	not happening. Um, good. I was going to come in here and do a whole, I told you so thing,
295240	299560	but then I realized, I mean, I feel like I've been kind of saying this for a little bit,
299560	304000	but the week where I really said like e three is not happening. And I don't know why you
304000	307200	all keep think it is happening. It is not happening because it would have been announced
307200	312820	by now. That was the week we ended up stopping the show 30 minutes in and it wasn't podcast.
312820	320120	So I'm like, Oh God, gosh, darn it. The one, the one thing I doubt you cannot argue. I
320120	326840	called it, uh, is, is lost. Yeah, this try had witnesses. A lot of life folks. I don't,
326840	331720	I don't recall you ever saying that. Well, guess what? Guess what? I ended up saving
331720	336320	the footage. I was going to let it cause today was the day it gets deleted cause stuff stays
336320	340320	on Twitch for two weeks. So I was going to let it get deleted today. And I was like,
340320	345120	ah shit. If I said that and I'm going to go to, I might as well just save it, whatever.
345120	350520	It'll be a, a special little thing, I guess. So anyway, it's there, it's there in the archives.
350520	355560	So that's fake news. Uh, thank you. Thank you everyone in chat
355560	359440	for inflating my ego. Uh, Jason, our, our voiceover guy is there in chat saying, you
359440	363320	know, what's funny. I was going to say, Rob called it in my first draft of the intro.
363320	368280	Uh, tiger con chat says with Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony doing their own thing. They don't
368280	372200	need E3 anymore. Well, it's interesting. And you know, Bobby went in the current iteration
372200	376160	of E3 is garbage anyway. Yeah. Bobby went in depth on this, on his show, a little bit
376160	381600	talking about kind of like the industry basically has no trade show right now because you know,
381600	386040	the consumers, uh, demanded to be led into the trade show. Um, and I thought he made
386040	391240	some very good points and kind of ended up on an aha moment towards the end of the show.
391240	398720	Like when, when did E3 really start to shit the bed? I don't know how else to put it.
398720	403440	And I honestly, a lot of it is on, and I, I really put most of the blame at the feet
403440	407960	of the ESA. And I, again, I've been saying this for a long time. This one's a little
407960	414080	more of a hot take, take it or leave it. The ESA is an archaic organization that is
414080	418400	not doing no good for this industry right now. And I don't know why the ESA is still
418400	423080	in business, quite frankly. Uh, when Sony backed out of E3, that should have been the
423080	427520	beginning of the end for the ESA. I kind of think it was, I think they're just dying a
427520	434560	much slower death. Um, and I think is, is that in any industry innovation is, is difficult.
434560	440840	Anything that changes what people are used to is, well, I mean, people are slow to slow
440840	447420	to change and, and I don't disagree. However, this is the fucking tech industry and I would
447420	453480	expect the ESA to be innovating and you, you're, you're, you're right in that they don't. And
453480	457360	that's why they're, they're a failure. And that's why they got hacked all those times
457360	461420	that they did, because they can't even live up to the security that they're preaching
461420	466980	other people to follow. Like the ESA is a joke. Like, and so I, for one will not miss
466980	472860	E3, rest in piss. Bye. And I think, you know, we got into a lot of it a couple of weeks
472860	480620	ago about how a lot of what E3 kind of stood for 20 years ago, doesn't hold up anymore.
480620	485780	This industry had a lot of growing up to do, still has some growing up to do, but it's
485780	489460	grown up a little bit. You know, I think we can look that there has been progress made
489460	494480	in the last 20 years. And I don't think the show of 20 years ago is going to hold up anymore.
494480	501100	So I think the E3 that all of you remember being televised on G4, which was that point
501100	506660	that we kind of hit on at the end of Bobby show where, uh, when they started televising
506660	515340	E3 on G4, it turned up that FOMO dial to 11. What other trade show was televised on TV
515340	518220	24 seven.
518940	520580	Which it didn't need to be.
520580	523780	No, it didn't. And the ESA shouldn't have allowed it.
523780	530140	That was the failure. So they, well, the whole thing is that I think if we open this up to
530140	537240	some of the public, right, then this is going to put more money in our pockets with, with
537240	544180	losing sight of what the purpose of the show is for. Now, I mean, when, when I was going,
544180	551060	it was under the DDR freak umbrella, but I also took the opportunities to, to try to
551060	555820	network, you know, I mean, that's when I went to a GDC, that's what I was doing was networking
555820	558460	with people.
558460	562180	I I'm, I'm going to say something I'm probably going to regret saying, but I'm going to say
562180	567300	it anyway. You know me, um, I well, and I've also grown up and my perspectives have changed
567300	571300	over the last few years and I reserve the right to change my opinions because sometimes
571300	575100	I learn new things that changed my opinions. And so what I'm going to say in the context
575100	581060	of that is, number one, I don't think E3 should ever come back. We should have a trade show.
581060	588060	Yes, but I don't think the ESA, it shouldn't be the ESA's thing because the ESA is incompetent.
588060	593220	But although the name is very clever, just saying E3, you know, I think they should keep
593220	595380	the name and have someone else own it.
595380	602180	If E3 were to come back, I think it should go back to the airport years when it was very
602180	607540	selective on who got in and very selective on what they were showing and how that all
607540	614260	went down. Obviously that needs to be, um, tailored a little more. Um, and, uh, but that's,
614260	620300	that's what the show, whatever succeeds E3 is probably going to look like, and I'm saying
620300	627620	this because people need to get used to this. If they really truly want a trade show, it's
627620	631820	going to look like those years that E3 was at the Long Beach airport. Was that where
631820	635700	it was? I think it was. And that the hotels and all of that. And that was the year that
635700	640140	only what, like two to 3000 people got in. I know semantics, semantics. I know you're
640140	645160	going to say they're under contract to the LA conventions. The ESA shouldn't even doing
645160	648700	it in the first place. Those contracts won't matter. I'm not even saying it needs to be
648700	654740	in LA. Um, I think you either go to a different name in the ESA, is it running it then that
654740	661580	contract doesn't apply. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so I, it'll be interesting to see what comes
661580	668480	of the whole thing. Um, Bobby is in chat saying my favorite E3 was E3 2008, which was limited
668480	673560	attendance like the airport years, but still at LA convention center. E3 2007 was the one
673560	677780	in Santa Monica, but they ran a small E3 at the LA convention center and that was better
677780	682520	than the, uh, than the spread out stuff in the airport hangar. That sounds a lot like
682520	686460	a logistic thing where like just being all spread out all over Long Beach was probably
686460	689900	a pain in the butt. Having it all at the LA convention center was probably just a lot
689900	694020	more convenient. And I, I that's, that's a logistics thing. And you know, that's up to
694020	700740	whatever E3 successor, if there is one ends up being. So, um, we'll see. Now, the fall
700740	704760	was really just getting rid of Kenshi Hall. I'm kidding. Um, I didn't even really get
704760	712380	into the specifics of the story. Um, the news broke from a tweet from Razor PR lead
712380	717980	Will Powers, um, who said that they had sent out an email announcing the cancellation of
717980	723980	a digital E3 event. Well, if you're going to have an E3 where you actually want to keep
723980	729840	secrets that don't get out to the internet, now you know how, who not to invite. No, he,
729840	735300	he didn't do anything wrong. Um, but I was just thinking about how there are other trade
735300	740260	shows. Like the movie industry has a trade show where they show new movies to cinema
740260	746220	or new trailers anyway, to a cinema chain owners and people that own movie theaters.
746220	751020	And those trailers don't leak out because there's still a lot of NDAs and non-disclosure
751020	755160	agreements that go in line with those. I'll be interested to see what sort of non-disclosures
755160	760980	agreements, whatever EA successor gets into. There were always NDAs at E3, by the way,
760980	764260	just not the stuff that was out there on the show floor, but everything you were seeing
764260	768560	upstairs in the conference room, I would say 90% of that was under non-disclosure agreements
768560	772520	because they were showing things that weren't going to be announced for a little while.
772520	778580	So ends up in some of the rooms that would say no, no video, no photography. And then
778580	784540	there would be some that would be like, you know, they would have specific material or
784540	793640	copies of the demo to give out that didn't have like anything of worth on it. Like more
793640	798300	like a press kit on a CD in the later times.
798300	802340	By the way, I'm going back to the story and I'm looking at the guy's Twitter and it says
802340	806620	in his bio, he's a reality TV winner. Wasn't this the guy that won the tester? I'm almost
806620	808300	positive it was.
808300	809300	What's his name?
809300	813760	Will Powers. Didn't he win like the first or second season of the tester?
813980	818880	I was like a raptor, but I don't know that guy didn't win. He was on it. Sure. He did
818880	825200	not win. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's I'm I just, am I the only one that sees the humor
825200	826200	in that?
826200	834040	I never watched. I never watched the use our Google food. So this is the tester winner.
834040	837200	That was the only one. I think there's only one. No, there's a few seasons because the
837200	842360	gay guy won one of the seasons. Oh, really? And then
842360	843360	I wonder why it fails.
843360	846560	Cyrus on season one.
846560	851480	Yeah. Bobby's saying Wiki doesn't even give their real names. I'm I'm telling you, it's
851480	853760	the guy that won the tester.
853760	858840	Season two was gamer. G A Y M E R. Okay. Cesar three was
858840	860520	Mike. Mike Deff's agrees with me.
860520	862020	Achilles might.
862020	868120	Mike Deff agrees with me. Will Powers won season one. Yes. Okay. And Bobby says, yes,
868120	873960	Cyrus was Will Powers. Okay, thank you. All right. Now, I'm glad I'm just I'm just surprised
873960	877840	that's not in the bio here on the news article.
877840	880400	Yep, that's it.
880400	885880	Okay. Oh, Mike Deff brought the receipts from a PlayStation blog. That's funny.
885880	886880	Yeah, I see that.
886880	888880	It was also an Engadget article.
888880	894440	Well, good for him. He's living out his dream being in the industry and and providing breaking
894440	897720	breaking news. Good for him. I'm not I'm not being shady at all.
897720	899200	I'll never invite him back.
899200	903200	Well, it was just one of those things where I was like, wait a minute. Why I can't shake
903200	911080	this feeling. All right. Anyway, um, the ESA did confirm in an official statement that
911080	919120	E3 2022 is canceled. However, they say in the follow up, E3 will return in 2023 with
919120	924720	a reinvigorated showcase.
924720	929920	So that's we're saying so as much as I'm sitting here celebrating the death of E3 because
929920	935840	I think that's a line. I don't think it is coming back in 2023. We'll see. Yeah, no,
935840	936840	I you know,
936840	941180	it means they haven't made a decision to cancel it for good. That's all. Yeah.
941180	948920	So yeah, here's the entire statement from the ESA. E3 will return in 2023 with a reinvigorated
948920	954180	showcase that celebrates new and exciting video games and industry innovations. We previously
954180	959480	announced that E3 would not be held in person in 2022 due to the ongoing health risks that
959480	960480	surrounding COVID-19.
960480	963180	Oh, that's true.
963180	970680	Well, I'm it's a cop out. It's escaped out. Like I'm not I'm not saying it's not true.
970680	975600	But I'm saying compared to literally the rest of the world and how everything is functioning
975600	980140	at other trade shows. And so in fact that like people are not canceling anything because
980140	986740	COVID anymore. And I just got back from Las Vegas, where I was maybe in the 3% of people
986740	997060	that were wearing masks in casinos, like COVID-19 is a convenient excuse for the ESA. And I
997060	1003180	I know that's not the the the PC thing to say. But it's absolutely correct. And I think
1003180	1009740	COVID-19 was the convenient excuse for the ESA last year to to be quite honest,
1009980	1012940	should be a valid excuse. People aren't really treating it as one.
1013020	1013740	Correct.
1014420	1018280	It is but they could take precautions and stuff, especially that would be your perfect time to
1018280	1023980	lower the attendance is to, you know, okay, we'll have people in person, but we're only going to do
1023980	1028940	like a quarter of the attendees due to COVID or something, but they didn't even do that. They
1028940	1030540	just said, oh, we're not doing it.
1030580	1035540	Fucking brilliant. Loki. Honestly, the best thing the ESA probably could have done was to have it
1035540	1041100	anyway, vaccine masks, and you know what, we're not going to have the consumers this year, we're
1041100	1045100	not going to we're going to cut all these people out because of COVID.
1047060	1049580	Your perfect scapegoat right there, you know, you could just
1049900	1053220	that would have been to what it was that would have been the better scapegoat.
1055060	1061420	But that's not why so you know that that's why they're, you know, doing what they're doing.
1062180	1067260	Anyway, continuing with the statement. Today, we announced there will also be no digital E3
1067260	1070540	showcase in 2022. See, COVID doesn't stop that.
1070940	1075140	Well, that's because of digital COVID. Haven't you heard? It's the new variant that goes over the
1075140	1075540	internet.
1075540	1076980	Ah, yes, the computer will get COVID.
1076980	1079420	Yes, we can't expose our people.
1079420	1083300	Yes, the computer virus that exposes personal information. Yes.
1083500	1086260	And then the variant Corvid where you you know, poop crows.
1087060	1088980	The metaverse COVID.
1091140	1091780	MetaVid.
1093140	1099620	Instead, we will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and
1099620	1101620	digital E3 experience next summer.
1102020	1106820	Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the
1106820	1111620	community, media and industry back together in an all new format and interactive experience.
1112180	1114460	Bullshit, but I'm going to tell you why it's bullshit.
1114860	1120420	If the ESA wants me to believe that because right now I don't and I've given you a damn good list of
1120420	1121580	reasons why I don't.
1122380	1126940	They would have already said, who's on board with that 2023 vision?
1127260	1130980	Who have you gotten to agree to this 2023 show?
1131060	1132740	Who are your partners in this?
1132900	1134020	You don't got any.
1135820	1138300	You're trying to sell snake oil right now, ESA.
1139140	1141020	You're selling a vision.
1141020	1141940	Why don't you go to Kickstarter?
1141940	1142540	And the Phantom.
1143020	1143660	And the Phantom.
1144380	1145860	Wasn't the Phantom there one time?
1145860	1147420	I swear to God, I played the Phantom.
1147420	1148420	It was, yeah.
1149420	1151420	I think we saw the Phantom, yeah.
1152460	1153700	It was real, sort of.
1154460	1154820	All right.
1154820	1156060	For like a minute.
1156060	1158780	What was in the box?
1158820	1163780	We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023.
1163780	1167540	That part they have to say because of the contract with the convention center.
1167780	1169820	Look for more news and announcements soon.
1169860	1172220	So that's, that's the one thing you can count on.
1173100	1176660	The ESA, if they don't end up just throwing it in the trash, they're going to have this
1176660	1179340	convention at the LA convention center because they have to.
1180620	1183540	So, I mean, that doesn't mean it won't be like one room.
1183860	1186260	Not it'll, it might be the size of drag con.
1186260	1191140	It might just be one little hall, but it might, it'll still happen at the LA convention center.
1192300	1196220	There's a line from MST3K that's popping through my head right now.
1196220	1197500	Whoopty shit.
1198260	1202860	I just think what it is, is it, it, I think you have a lot of these companies, I would
1202860	1208860	imagine, they're looking to cut costs, throwing a big press event with booths and stuff like
1208860	1215060	that, doesn't really do much more than showcasing their footage and stuff in their own
1215060	1217340	controlled environment where they have all the attention.
1217620	1222620	Like, I just say, it's like, I can put on a presentation for a few thousand dollars, or I
1222620	1225340	could rent out a booth space for a few million dollars.
1226340	1227220	What would I rather do?
1227220	1231940	And then this way, you also don't have to like, push your dev teams to put out demos and
1231940	1234580	stuff like that, to build a demo for E3.
1234940	1238620	Like, it just makes more sense not to do it anymore.
1240180	1244660	Yeah, um, I mean, there's a lot to be said, though, about some of the elements of the
1244660	1249860	trade show, like the networking and, you know, connecting and sharing ideas and so forth.
1249860	1256340	But yeah, the industry has kind of gotten to this interesting place where they're, they're
1256340	1258980	putting so much of it just out on the internet at once.
1258980	1264500	It's like, there's no secrets in this industry anymore when it comes to working with other
1264500	1264940	people.
1264940	1266100	I don't know, it's weird.
1268180	1273260	Anyway, one thing that a lot of people are turning to is Summer Game Fest.
1273260	1277100	And so a lot of people are already declaring Summer Game Fest, the new E3.
1277100	1281500	It's way too early to be doing that, because Summer Game Fest is not a trade show.
1281980	1287420	Summer Game Fest is a summer version of the game awards that happened in December.
1287580	1289500	That is what Summer Game Fest is thus far.
1290020	1293060	Not, not word for word, not page for page.
1293580	1295620	But it's a very, they come from the same playbook.
1297420	1302500	So Jeff Keeley did conveniently timing share some more information about Summer Game Fest.
1302500	1304460	He said, yes, it's taking place this year.
1304460	1306100	Yes, it's going to occur in June.
1306260	1309380	Yes, there's going to be a live kickoff show at the start of the event.
1310060	1314820	And the presentation will have new announcements and first looks at various gaming properties.
1315620	1320300	The official website, of course, will have all the details in the coming weeks.
1321300	1326020	Jeff Keeley also had a very interesting timed tweet with everything that was going on with
1326020	1326500	E3.
1326500	1329220	I got to pull it up now because of course, I don't have it in front of me.
1329380	1332580	But he said something very tongue in cheek, and he kind of had to go back and clarify
1332580	1338420	it that like, I'm not trying to shade E3, but like the tweet read is like, kind of shady.
1339380	1341860	I wonder if he still has it up or if he ended up deleting it.
1342740	1344500	Of course, I'm sure the chat is already on it.
1345300	1347220	But I'm trying to bring it up for myself here.
1348100	1348900	Let's see.
1350500	1350900	Huh.
1350900	1351460	My bad.
1351460	1352820	I'll bring it up for myself here.
1353940	1354820	Let's see.
1356500	1357700	March 31st.
1357700	1358660	It was a day.
1359700	1362420	Oh, he just tweeted a winky face.
1362580	1367620	That's a lot of people thought that was a winky face emote was you shady bitch pretty
1367620	1368100	much.
1370740	1372900	I guess you can read a lot into a winky face emote.
1372900	1373380	I don't know.
1374260	1375540	But anyway, Summer Game Fest.
1375540	1376340	It's coming back.
1376980	1377620	We'll see.
1377860	1380260	We'll see how it goes and what they all have.
1380260	1381300	But it's not a trade show.
1381940	1386820	There might be a keynote that happens in person or something like that, but it's not going
1386820	1389060	to be exactly the same thing as E3.
1390660	1397060	It looks like the June gaming event season, which I don't even know if we call it E3 anymore.
1397060	1399060	I don't think we shouldn't be calling it E3 anymore.
1399060	1406500	The June media season in gaming will probably be a Nintendo Direct.
1406500	1409140	That's also another interesting question to ask.
1409220	1412900	Nintendo is off the hook to do an E3 direct.
1412900	1414660	Will they still do one in June?
1415620	1417140	I don't see why they wouldn't.
1418020	1425940	But if Nintendo decided to do a summer direct in July, y'all can't say shit because there's
1425940	1427300	no E3 to time it with.
1428500	1430420	So I wonder if that might get delayed.
1430420	1430900	We'll see.
1432980	1438260	I just wonder if we're still going to see game companies kind of coalesce around doing
1438260	1441620	announcements in June or if it's just going to be all over the place.
1442980	1447780	Tiger Claw on chat says they'll probably do a direct but not call it E3 or something.
1447780	1449540	Did they call it E3 last year?
1450820	1451940	I don't remember if they did.
1454820	1457540	Pele Jarumeo says they did not.
1457540	1457940	Thank you.
1458740	1465140	Pele Jarumeo says just like tech killed newspapers, E3 is a victim of changing media habits and
1465140	1465780	tech.
1465780	1468740	That's why the fan centric cons will still flourish.
1468740	1470020	Oh, absolutely.
1470020	1472660	This has nothing to do with fan cons.
1472660	1476820	And ironically, the consumer expos, this has nothing to do with them.
1477700	1484660	And this that you're right, they will continue to flourish as people are feeling the pain
1484660	1486500	of the last two years.
1486500	1491700	And even if it's probably not the best idea to be going out and doing these things, people
1491700	1493300	are going to go out and do these things.
1493300	1497940	We can at least hope conventions will be smart and at least have precautions because
1497940	1502020	precautions, you know, and Bobby said this earlier, there is no convention that has been
1502020	1504340	declared a super spreader or no gaming convention.
1504340	1509060	I know of that's been declared a super spreader event yet because they're all mandating
1509060	1510100	precautions.
1510100	1516260	Everyone I've been to is mask and VAX or negative test in 48 hours or whatever it is,
1516260	1517460	whatever it was for Dragon Con.
1518020	1522820	And following those precautions go an awful long way in stopping super spreader types
1522820	1523300	of things.
1523940	1525780	So interesting.
1525780	1528500	Bobby Blackwell says, I just checked a super spreader database.
1528500	1531300	Not a single convention was on the list as a super spreader event.
1531300	1532980	Lots of weddings and nursing homes, though.
1534340	1538900	I thought early on in the pandemic, there was ironically a science convention that was
1538900	1540500	one of the first super spreader events.
1541300	1544100	So and that obviously nobody knew anything then.
1544100	1548660	So I'm not saying it's a fault of that convention, but I worry about that database you're looking
1548660	1552500	at because if it doesn't list that one, a biotech or something like that was one of
1552500	1556020	the early, early, early conventions in the science industry that had it.
1556020	1561220	So Mike Deff says, I went to a convention yesterday and most people were masked, even
1561220	1562260	if it was an outside event.
1562900	1566900	SSU100Matt says the Sturgis Bike Festival was a super spreader event.
1566900	1573220	Well, the people there simply did not believe in COVID.
1574580	1576820	And that wasn't a convention to be that also.
1576820	1578100	That was a very different.
1578100	1580820	That was a festival semantics, I know.
1581540	1583860	But it it would fall in a different category.
1584500	1588820	So isn't that the one that Smash Mouth played and gotten a lot of shit for?
1588820	1589940	I think it was.
1589940	1595300	Anyway, I think I think I think it was because I remember the parodies that were like, hey,
1595300	1596740	now you've got COVID.
1596740	1597940	Get your cough on.
1597940	1598660	Hey, now.
1598660	1598900	All right.
1598900	1602660	Anyway, we shouldn't joke about it, but I do.
1602660	1607460	I have to tell jokes when people have to have that gallows humor when you when people are
1607460	1609300	willfully ignorant about it.
1609300	1610820	I have to joke about that.
1611700	1613460	So please understand the difference.
1614100	1614500	All right.
1615700	1619860	Anyhow, so E3 canceled back next year.
1620980	1624500	Summer Game Fest still happening, although we don't know the specifics of what that looked
1624500	1624900	like.
1624900	1629700	But it will be interesting to see if Jeff Keighley tries to corral the horses because
1629700	1630420	he does.
1630420	1632580	He does have a good relationship with Nintendo.
1632580	1634740	He does have a good relationship with a lot of partners.
1634740	1639300	It will be interesting to see if he does corral the horses to get everybody to still
1639300	1641620	make their announcements around that same time.
1641620	1646180	I just think what Jeff Keighley needs to do don't have Summer Game Fest as a three month
1646180	1646500	event.
1647140	1648340	That was silly.
1648340	1650420	That lowers the impact of it.
1650420	1653620	You need to corral that to two weeks tops.
1654420	1657060	I mean, if people want to do announcements outside of that, fine.
1657060	1658500	But that's not Summer Game Fest.
1659140	1663940	So just something I think Jeff needs to work on in that whole regard is Summer Game Fest
1663940	1665060	is not a three month event.
1665060	1665700	Give me a break.
1666260	1668820	That's just summer in the games industry.
1669940	1671700	So yeah, Dr.
1671700	1675780	Sia says, I mean, if he can do it for the game awards and he has no competition this
1675780	1677620	year, this is the year to do it.
1678260	1684980	This is the if Jeff wants to attack the ESA's weak point for massive damage and considering
1684980	1690660	he backed out of E3 before it was officially gone, he may have a bone to pick with them
1690660	1691300	allegedly.
1691300	1696260	I don't know anything, but there are interesting signs that line up that show that Jeff Keighley
1696260	1700580	may have a little bit of personal interest in attacking the weak point of E3 for massive
1700580	1701300	damage here.
1701300	1708980	I don't know, but I know why we're here to announce Keighley 3 coming soon this summer.
1708980	1713060	I don't know about y'all, but spite is a big motivator for me.
1713860	1719140	And if I'm Jeff Keighley and I may or may not allegedly have some spite in my back pocket,
1719140	1720420	let that do the motivating.
1721780	1724820	Godspeed, Jeff Keighley, our Canadian friend.
1724820	1725320	All right.
1726260	1731380	By the way, Rob, I think I found my E3 2006 photos.
1733380	1734340	I have one of those two.
1734340	1737940	There's one of you and I sitting on the ground in the media room somewhere that keeps popping
1737940	1738900	up and that one.
1738900	1741460	But these are hold on.
1742580	1744020	They need to be super rotated.
1744020	1745300	I don't know how they got this way.
1746340	1747060	Okay, never mind.
1747060	1749460	That's the Winchester Mystery House, but I have a couple.
1750420	1753700	So because it was in May that year.
1755860	1758100	So I'll have to see if I can find them.
1758100	1761540	They got to be spread out amongst these, but I did find the one of you and me.
1761540	1764820	Vognetwork.com slash discord to so young.
1765460	1766500	I know what happened.
1767060	1767560	All right.
1768900	1769940	Enough about E3.
1769940	1773380	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things that we have been playing
1773380	1774020	this week.
1774020	1775780	So Dark Sakura, I'll start with you.
1775780	1776660	How was your gaming week?
1777620	1779780	Um, it's been pretty eventful.
1780340	1787300	I'm still playing through Seiken Densetsu 3 or as it was called Trials of Mana.
1788820	1795140	I'm also, of course, still doing Dead by Daylight, which I'm having a lot of fun with.
1795140	1796260	I found a picture of Evan.
1796900	1797860	I'm sorry.
1797860	1804900	Anyway, I'm also still playing my silly little wordscapes game and I've been enjoying
1804900	1807700	watching other people play Elden Ring, so I don't have to.
1809700	1814900	We also have the Indianapolis 500 pinball now, and there's been a little bit of play
1814900	1816020	that going on in my house.
1816020	1816580	Oh, that's fun.
1817860	1819700	Yeah, not too bad.
1821460	1821780	All right.
1821780	1822740	That's about it.
1822740	1823540	Loki, we'll go to you.
1823540	1824340	How was your gaming week?
1825220	1834820	Uh, well, I played Minecraft still, and I also did finally boot up my DR machine to
1835700	1839940	set it up for the kids to play, and then they were doing something else, so I decided to
1839940	1842900	play it a little bit, so I need to get back into that.
1842900	1843860	At least it still works.
1847700	1848980	Yeah, and that's it?
1849700	1850260	That's it.
1850260	1850660	Yeah.
1850660	1853300	You know Minecraft and usually something else.
1853300	1853700	All right.
1853700	1854340	I found them.
1855220	1856340	E3 2005.
1857540	1857780	Get it.
1857780	1859140	Put them in our Discord server or something.
1859140	1863060	I bet folks would like to see with the boomerang controller for the PS3.
1863620	1864180	Oh, God.
1865140	1866340	That's a throwback.
1866340	1866980	All right.
1866980	1868180	Get ready, Discord.
1869700	1872180	Maybe do like one or two a day this week.
1872180	1874500	Don't throw 30 pictures in there at once.
1874500	1875300	I'll forget.
1875300	1875620	All right.
1876820	1877700	I'll do a group of them.
1878420	1879220	Let's see.
1879220	1880020	My gaming week.
1880020	1883620	So I ended up not playing a lot this week because I've been in Vegas for the past few
1883620	1887220	days, so we went to Las Vegas on Wednesday and just got back yesterday.
1887220	1891060	We flew back Saturday because it was cheaper flights, but while we were in Vegas, we went
1891060	1897460	to the Pinball Museum Hall of Fame, and it's in a new place now than the last time I went.
1897460	1900980	It used to be in that strip mall that was a little ways away from the strip.
1900980	1903300	Now it is literally at the start of the strip.
1903300	1903940	They moved it.
1903940	1907940	It's right where the famous sign that says, Welcome to Vegas is at the very start of the
1907940	1908440	strip.
1909060	1910420	Kind of it's honest.
1910420	1911700	Okay, let me put it in perspective.
1912340	1917140	In Pikmin, when I hit my little radar thing at the Pinball Hall of Fame, I got airport
1917140	1919620	Pikmin because it's literally right there.
1920420	1923060	Could be near the Liberace Museum, remember?
1924580	1926100	Where was the Liberace Museum?
1926100	1926740	That was-
1926740	1927620	I don't remember.
1927620	1930820	I just remember that we passed the Liberace Museum when Tiara took me.
1933300	1940100	I know that you can't miss this place because they've painted the word pinball in gigantic
1940100	1943780	letters, and I think they did it because the airport is right there.
1943780	1948820	You can see it as you're actually landing at the airport, which is pretty funny, and
1948820	1951460	that's a very funny way to advertise.
1951460	1955300	They also have their own fancy new neon sign that looks like the Vegas sign.
1955300	1959700	So they're making money or something or got a good grant or something because they've
1959700	1960980	really upped the place.
1960980	1964420	It's a much bigger space and they have more stuff in there.
1964420	1966980	They have a lot of broken stuff, but they had that before.
1966980	1970260	I'm not really holding that against them because they have a lot of great working stuff.
1971060	1973140	So I saw a crap ton of pinball tables.
1974180	1975860	I more watched Alan play.
1975860	1977140	I didn't play a lot myself.
1977140	1980020	I played the Tron arcade machine they had there because I had to.
1980900	1986900	I played a Nightmare on Elm Street pinball table, which I forgot existed, and I enjoyed
1986900	1987140	it.
1987140	1988740	So I was like, this is fun.
1988740	1991700	Was that wasn't it like a Gottlieb one?
1991700	1992900	I think it is a Gottlieb table.
1992900	1995300	Yeah, I have a picture of it somewhere because I put it on Instagram.
1995300	1997700	The Gottlieb ones are hit and miss.
1999140	2001060	It was fun, but it's really easy.
2001060	2004900	I don't know if it was tuned that way, but basically I won a free game and Alan won a
2004900	2005460	free game.
2005460	2006420	So it was very easy.
2007300	2009780	Um, and then I watched.
2009780	2012020	This is a funny thing, and you'll get a kick out of this dark soccer.
2012020	2016180	I watched Alan drop like $4 into Elvira scared stiff.
2016820	2019220	And I was like, why don't you just go to dark soccer's house?
2019220	2020420	Or well, I know you don't have it anymore.
2020420	2020980	We gave it back.
2020980	2023060	I know, but I was like, why don't you just go over there and play it?
2023060	2026740	But he was like, I'm here and it's right in front of me and damn it, I'm going to play
2026740	2026900	it.
2026900	2029380	I'm like, all right, I'm not going to tell you what to do.
2029380	2030340	Like I can play Tron.
2030340	2031300	I'm not faulting that.
2031300	2031700	Yeah.
2031700	2034660	So, um, and I watched him play some other stuff too.
2035220	2037620	I watched him play that, uh, circus volitaire.
2037620	2038660	It's a fun machine.
2038660	2039060	Voltaire.
2039060	2039700	That's it.
2039700	2040580	Uh, that's a fun machine.
2040580	2041700	I'm trying to remember what else I played.
2041700	2042580	Oh, Arabian nights.
2042580	2043220	I love that table.
2043220	2044020	I have to play that.
2044020	2045940	That was also a Papa Duke table.
2045940	2048900	The guy who did a theater and a world cup.
2050420	2050920	Got it.
2051460	2055940	Um, Bobby Blackwell says the Liberace museum was North and East of the airport.
2055940	2059140	The pinball hall of fame is on the Western edge of the airport.
2059140	2061380	It's right next door to the Harley Davidson thing.
2061940	2063060	I do know that too.
2063060	2063460	I don't know.
2063460	2065460	I don't know if that rings a bell at all.
2065460	2066500	I don't know what it was before.
2066500	2067300	Good Kingdom Hearts.
2069140	2070580	Um, sorry.
2070580	2071940	Oh, E3 pictures.
2071940	2072740	Um, let's see.
2072740	2075700	I'm trying to think of what other pinball tables I like play.
2075700	2078180	They have a lot of old arcade machines too, which is cool.
2078180	2079540	I just had a good time.
2079540	2084020	So, and it's funny because somebody was asking me, so I missed a friend of mine that used
2084020	2084900	to listen to this show.
2084900	2086020	I don't know if he still does.
2086020	2086260	Hi.
2086260	2089780	You know who you are if you're listening, but he messaged me on Instagram and he's like,
2089780	2091460	I'm going to Vegas this weekend.
2091860	2092180	Great.
2092180	2093060	When do you get here?
2093700	2098020	He was like getting there like two hours after my flight took off on Saturday.
2098020	2099940	I'm like, how convenient.
2099940	2102420	So I was like, all right.
2102420	2104500	Well, he said, where are the DDR machines?
2104500	2106420	And I'm like, I have to be honest.
2106420	2110580	I kind of stopped like scoping where DDR machines were a long time ago.
2110580	2114180	I'm sure some of the casinos have them, but I don't really scope out the arcades, the
2114180	2114900	casinos anymore.
2114900	2119620	I said, but the pinball hall of fame has a DDR X cause I just saw that.
2119620	2120820	So go there.
2120820	2124660	And I just think the pinball hall of fame is a good stop for any gamer.
2124660	2129540	Even if you feel kind of met on pinball, I would ask a, why are you met on pinball when
2129540	2132100	you like other, I think pinball is great, but whatever.
2132740	2135140	And they have a good collection of retro arcade games too.
2135860	2139780	And they have like weird shit that used to be in seventies and eighties arcades.
2139780	2144100	Do you remember that machine that would make wax Donald Duck figures?
2145300	2149700	I think I made one with Melody when I went there with her, there was maybe dark soccer
2149700	2150660	saw it when she was there.
2151220	2154020	But they have one for Pluto now next to it.
2154020	2156660	And I was like, wow, that's a blast from the past.
2156660	2157460	So there's that.
2158100	2160420	And a pod culture and chat is bringing up.
2160420	2163940	Rob teased me by messaging me a pic of the doctor who pinball table.
2163940	2165060	Yes, I did.
2165060	2165780	I did.
2165780	2171780	I wanted to play the rush pinball table, but some guy was on it like nonstop because I
2171780	2172980	know it's the hot new shit.
2172980	2174340	Somebody was on it nonstop.
2174340	2177940	So I was like, all right, I'll just play it when I visit Bobby Black Wolf later this year
2178660	2180420	for Dragon Con 2022.
2180420	2181140	So we'll see.
2181700	2187300	So dark to see it says I did play the Tron pinball when I was there.
2187300	2190820	I did not see the Tron pinball or I would have played that too.
2191380	2192500	Yeah, the pinball is good.
2192500	2194660	I love what they did with the ramps in that game.
2194660	2196340	But yeah, I didn't see it.
2196340	2197620	You've got the deluxe that is.
2197620	2199700	Yeah, it might have been out of commission.
2199700	2201060	And that's why I didn't notice it.
2201060	2203060	They did have a lot of pinball games are out of commission.
2203060	2204420	So we'll see.
2204980	2208100	Anyway, so yeah, the bulk of my gaming week was being in Vegas.
2208100	2209300	I'm going to say off topic.
2209300	2211860	I just have to say I saw two shows while I was in Vegas.
2212740	2216260	I saw Drag Race Live and all I'm going to say about it.
2216260	2217460	It wasn't that good.
2218260	2223140	Like it was I felt like it was false advertising to of the eight girls on the poster.
2223140	2225140	Two of them were in the show I saw that night.
2225700	2230580	And then they had, I think, understudies because it was Alexis Mateo and Kahana Montrese, which
2230580	2231220	both are great.
2231220	2232340	Don't get me wrong.
2232340	2235860	But it was a little like, oh, I thought we were going to be seeing these other girls.
2235860	2236340	All right.
2236340	2236740	Okay.
2236740	2238980	I mean, but the whole thing is super cheesy.
2238980	2242580	Anyway, I know some of you roll your eyes in the back of your head when I talk about
2242580	2242980	Drag Race.
2242980	2243860	That's all I'll say about it.
2243860	2244660	It was silly.
2244660	2247780	I think it would have I would have probably had a better time if I went to the real drag
2247780	2247940	show.
2247940	2248260	They have it.
2248260	2249060	Send your frogs.
2249060	2249780	I should have done that.
2251460	2255860	But the other show I went and saw, I went and saw Dionne Warwick on Thursday night.
2255860	2258420	Now y'all know I will hold her for.
2258420	2259060	Yeah, exactly.
2259060	2260820	I hope y'all know Dionne Warwick.
2260820	2261860	That's what friends are for.
2262900	2263780	And psychic.
2263780	2269540	Alfie, do you know the way to San Jose, her psychic friends commercials back in the day,
2269540	2272980	or the fact that she's the queen of Twitter now.
2272980	2274260	She has a great Twitter account.
2275620	2279700	And she was a Vegas legend for many years.
2280340	2285140	And she ran in the same circles with many of those Vegas legends you hear a lot about.
2286580	2290580	This place that I saw her at, I had no idea where this place was when I bought the tickets.
2291460	2295300	They were expensive, but they weren't that expensive because we did get the cheap seats.
2296020	2298660	But that room was maybe 250 people tops.
2300340	2302180	The Lyft driver gets to the venue.
2302180	2305460	There's a security guard at the gate who says, What are you here for?
2306340	2310020	And I'm like, isn't this is the Dionne Warwick concert here?
2310020	2311540	And they're like, Yep, go on in.
2311540	2313940	It's like I had to know the password to get into this place.
2315140	2317060	And then like the place was just itty bitty.
2317060	2321300	It was like seeing it in a wedding hall or a wedding reception room.
2321300	2323140	That's basically where I saw Dionne Warwick.
2323140	2327540	I haven't been to a concert that small since I saw Alanis Morissette perform at a library
2328660	2329380	in Big Sur.
2330100	2337780	So that right there was a pleasure, a treat, a once in a lifetime experience because Dionne
2337780	2339620	Warwick is a living legend.
2339620	2343540	If you don't know her, Google her, look her up, educate yourself because she's fabulous.
2344340	2346740	And the fact that I got to see her in such a small venue.
2346740	2353060	I'm like, Oh, and by the way, Alan and I, by far the youngest people in that room, by
2353060	2354900	far the youngest people in that room.
2356100	2358180	The other people sitting at the table with us.
2358180	2359700	The lady was super nice.
2359700	2361700	She was like, Yeah, I just retired.
2361700	2364580	I worked at the Vegas Convention Center and I just retired.
2364580	2366580	And let me tell you about all these things in Vegas.
2367860	2369060	She enjoyed hearing our story.
2369060	2370900	She was just a spunky older.
2370900	2373380	I'm not gonna say old lady, older lady.
2373860	2374980	Lady in her prime.
2375940	2382100	Yeah, so and yes, Misha also brings up for those that don't know, she's Whitney Houston's
2382100	2382500	cousin.
2382500	2384900	Yes, she's related to Whitney Houston as well.
2384900	2387060	I think Dionne Warwick is a legend in her own right.
2387060	2390020	But of course, we love legends related to legends, of course.
2390020	2395780	So anyway, so it was the whole thing was absolutely worth it for the Dionne Warwick show 100%.
2395780	2398660	And if you're going to be in Vegas when she's performing, I urge you to do it.
2399300	2402020	But you might want to dress nicer than Alan and I did.
2403460	2406180	Because the Vegas thing said it was casual.
2406180	2410660	And I wore I wore like a nice little polo shirt and some jeans.
2410660	2412100	So it was like what I might wear to work.
2412900	2415620	But I get there and people are like full on in suits and ties.
2416340	2417140	Boomer casual.
2418020	2418820	Yeah, you have to.
2418820	2420340	Yes, you have to go boomer casual.
2422580	2424420	Anyway, no regrets.
2424420	2425620	I had a great time at the show.
2425620	2428020	Just like you're going on a Pan Am flight.
2430900	2432660	Tiger class says no, I get it.
2433220	2436260	Back in the day when people used to dress up to fly.
2436260	2439620	Tiger class says sounds like the place was filled with old people who grew up on Dionne
2439620	2440740	Warwick, that part.
2442020	2447060	Or people who knew people who were old and grew up on Dionne Warwick.
2447060	2452260	So they heard a lot of it in, you know, so that's that's where I come in, I think.
2452260	2457620	And I just, you know, there's certain pictures of Rob and Matt, when you're gay, there's
2457620	2460980	certain divas you're going to hear about Dionne Warwick's one of them.
2460980	2463780	She might not be the one you hear about the most, but she's definitely one you're going
2463780	2464340	to hear about.
2464340	2470340	So anyway, sorry to delve into non-gaming stuff, but I had to get that off my chest
2470340	2473940	because again, that was a once in a lifetime show and I was just very giddy to get to do
2473940	2474260	that.
2474260	2475860	So there's that.
2475860	2480500	So all right, let's get back into video games and some actual headlines and stories.
2481300	2482180	Hey Rob.
2482180	2482680	What?
2483380	2485620	I found pictures of you and Matt.
2486820	2488740	I'm sure there's a lot of pictures of me and Matt.
2488740	2490660	If you just hit print screen, you'll get one right now.
2491540	2495620	When we recorded our podcast for at E3 2005.
2497220	2500020	Oh, we didn't really do it at E3.
2500020	2500900	Oh no, did we?
2500900	2502100	We did it in the hotel room.
2502100	2503300	Oh yeah, in the hotel room.
2503300	2503700	We did.
2503700	2504660	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2504660	2508580	I would say we might have done one in the media room, but yeah, it was the, which is,
2509140	2509780	you know what?
2511620	2516820	Does that make us the first, does that make us the first podcast to be done at E3?
2516820	2517460	Maybe not.
2518340	2520340	I don't want to stake a claim that's too big.
2522580	2525940	The first podcast that's still around, probably.
2526660	2527460	I don't know.
2527460	2527940	I don't know.
2527940	2528980	We're stubborn that way.
2528980	2536020	Well, keep in mind, most shows didn't start until June 2006 when, uh, podcasting hit iTunes.
2536020	2539220	So if we did a podcast about video games in 2005.
2541300	2541800	Yeah.
2542120	2543240	So anyway.
2544680	2546520	Oh, Bobby says, Oh, June 2005.
2546520	2547880	I always get the year wrong.
2547880	2548200	All right.
2548200	2550280	Then if it was 2005, nevermind.
2550280	2551480	If it was 2004.
2551480	2553560	I found 2006 as pictures just now.
2556040	2556840	Actually, I take it back.
2556840	2557800	That's California extreme.
2559320	2559880	All right.
2559880	2560120	Nope.
2560120	2560440	It is.
2560440	2560680	Nope.
2560680	2561240	It's E3.
2561240	2563880	All right, Jamie, you got to stop yelling about the random pictures.
2563880	2565160	Just post them in the discord.
2565160	2566200	Let's get back to the news.
2566200	2566840	All right.
2566840	2569000	Uh, Loki, kick us off with some news.
2569000	2575480	So yeah, we had some good news about Activision.
2575480	2579960	The good news is we're not talking about their sexual exploitation of their employees.
2579960	2582440	Um, no, this time we're talking about that headline.
2582440	2586440	We probably should mention that actually is that there's that settlement, right?
2587400	2587900	Yes.
2588920	2590280	So they settled.
2590360	2590920	Mm hmm.
2594040	2596200	Anyways, disclosed 18 million.
2596200	2599640	I think a drop in the bucket for Bobby Kotick's salary last year.
2599640	2601000	It's a few minutes.
2603000	2610120	Um, so apparently they put out a memo to their employees, uh, letting them know that, uh,
2610120	2615880	effective immediately, they are removing the company's vaccine mandate, meaning whether
2615880	2622600	or not you are, um, vaccinated against COVID-19, you can go ahead and come back in.
2623320	2629080	And because of that, there's already been a new, uh, walkout schedule for April 4th
2629080	2630840	in response to the office plan.
2630840	2631480	Good for them.
2631480	2633240	According to the ABK workers Alliance.
2633240	2633800	Good for them.
2634520	2639400	That that is that that that needs to happen more often where they start sticking it loudly
2639400	2640600	to their bosses.
2640600	2645080	I do think there is a, um, sort of a footnote with this though that I want to make sure
2645080	2651480	is clear because I believe studios within Activision Blizzard being one of them are
2651480	2655880	allowed to dictate their own terms on the vaccine theme, because I have seen that Blizzard
2655880	2659080	specifically is not waving that.
2659080	2665400	So even though an Activision senior put that out there, probably for the, the, the, those
2665400	2670920	under the Activision umbrella, um, the sub studios do get to make their own call on that.
2671480	2674040	So I, I think it is an important clarification.
2674040	2678600	So, um, because that means that like Blizzard would have no reason to participate in this
2678600	2683000	walkout unless, unless there's other things going on that are, that are not a part of
2683000	2685880	this report, um, that the walkout is going to cover.
2685880	2686040	Yeah.
2686040	2689800	They're trying to get everybody back in the office and then they say, we'll pivot if
2689800	2690280	necessary.
2690280	2693560	If we see a spike in cases, well, it's too late at that point.
2694920	2695240	Right.
2696200	2697320	But we're seeing this everywhere.
2697320	2701640	This goes back to what I said earlier about E3 using COVID-19 as an excuse.
2701640	2707480	Like literally the end, this is, this is an even better example of the industry going,
2708120	2710840	nevermind COVID-19 is, is in the past.
2710840	2711560	We beat it.
2711560	2712120	We did it.
2712680	2715560	We, uh, mission accomplished on the big banner.
2715560	2715880	Yep.
2715880	2716840	Mission accomplished.
2719560	2721960	I laugh cause I don't know what other emotion to have.
2721960	2728120	Um, but yeah, so, uh, good to the employees though, for, for holding out for what they
2728120	2729320	believe in with all that.
2729320	2732840	But, um, this is something that's happening at a lot of workplaces.
2732840	2737880	You know, I'm very thankful in my day job, they are taking it very slowly.
2737880	2741960	They're like dipping their toe in the water, uh, with this whole thing.
2741960	2746280	And they've pretty much said, at least where I'm at, that telework can be a permanent
2746280	2751800	option outside of necessary meetings and trainings that will be in person.
2751800	2754520	But we don't even know what those look like yet or when those start.
2755480	2762120	So, um, but there's a lot of workplaces, lot of, I'm sure a lot of people in chat
2762120	2766360	with stories to share where they're like, Nope, we're all coming back to the office
2766360	2767480	at least a couple of times a week.
2768040	2770680	So mission accomplished.
2772200	2773320	Yeah, we did it.
2775080	2775640	It's over.
2775640	2779160	We just have to cross our fingers and toes that as the virus continues to mutate, it
2779160	2780440	mutates downwards.
2780440	2784440	That's the ironically, I just got back from Vegas.
2784440	2788280	So maybe my perspective is that is, we're taking that gamble.
2788280	2792280	We're going to let it ride that COVID keeps mutating in a downward direction where it
2792280	2795320	might be more transmissible, but it's, it's less effective.
2795320	2798840	So let's just hope, you know, when it was after Omicron keeps going that way.
2798840	2801080	Letting it ride is quite a Vegas take on that.
2802200	2802700	Mm hmm.
2804520	2807800	Sjo and Hunter Matt says a lot of companies are pushing to get folks back in.
2807800	2809080	So this is a trend.
2809080	2812520	My company is pushing folks back in at least a hybrid setup.
2812520	2817000	It's interesting because there's a lot of talk about like, I know here where we live
2817000	2822360	in Sacramento, which by the way, our city in the news today, I need to I need to mention
2822360	2825320	this disgusting, not for a great reason.
2826360	2833240	The latest shooting of the week club, I guess there's another sign that COVID-19 is
2833240	2836840	apparently a thing of the past because now we're getting back to, you know, our every
2836840	2839400	other day mass shooting in America headlines.
2839400	2839900	Yeah.
2840280	2843480	So unfortunately, one happened in Sacramento last night.
2843480	2846520	Obviously, none of us were there even remotely involved with it.
2846520	2850200	Nobody I know, and I don't think anybody we know was was involved with it.
2850200	2855080	However, somebody somebody knows six of them were involved with it and lost their life
2855080	2855960	last night.
2855960	2857560	And it sucks.
2857560	2863640	And I sit here and I go, when are we going to do something about it?
2863640	2865960	But I already know the answer is never.
2865960	2868840	And I just always repeatedly think of that onion headline.
2869480	2874680	There is no possible way to stop this from happening asks or says country where this
2874680	2876200	only thing routinely happens.
2876200	2876520	Whatever.
2876520	2877240	I totally butchered it.
2877240	2877720	But you know what?
2877720	2881560	You know what I'm talking about that onion always goes around when these things happen.
2882680	2888520	So anyway, so what was I saying about Sacramento?
2888520	2889000	I forget.
2889000	2889500	Oh, yes.
2890280	2895240	Downtown, like they're actually trying to push people to go back in the office because
2895240	2899240	the businesses downtown are all hurting because everybody's working from home.
2899240	2901480	And the real estate's drying up and all that.
2901480	2904680	So it's it's very interesting to watch to see how this goes.
2904680	2905400	I feel so bad.
2905400	2907400	I know what the carbon impact has been like.
2910200	2911560	I'd be curious on that, too.
2912200	2913640	What that's look like.
2913640	2916200	Those poor real estate investors, I swear to God.
2917320	2918520	I feel so bad for them.
2919240	2923400	Those poor, those poor, poor billionaire towers, poor things.
2925720	2927800	Anyway, all right, let's move on.
2928520	2930680	Let's talk about something from last week.
2932120	2937000	Again, I don't love to talk about rumors here on Orange Lounge Radio, but some of them have
2937000	2940840	a bit more smoke than others where it indicates there is fire.
2940840	2944600	And sure enough, when we started last week's show, we talked about the PlayStation Plus
2944600	2945480	rumors.
2945480	2947000	What happened this week?
2947000	2948520	It got confirmed.
2948520	2954120	PlayStation is sort of taking on Game Pass, and a lot of it played out exactly how it
2954120	2954680	was leaked.
2955560	2956120	In a note.
2956120	2962360	And ironically, yeah, it's ironically light, like how we kind of predicted to that they
2962360	2963080	would steal ideas.
2963640	2964040	Sort of.
2964040	2964280	Yeah.
2964840	2969720	So SIE President Jim Ryan on the PlayStation blog said today, we are pleased to share with
2969720	2973160	you official news about changes coming to our subscription services.
2973160	2976200	I love that official news about the change.
2976200	2978040	The way that's phrased is actually kind of great.
2978600	2983400	This June, we're bringing together PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now in an all new PlayStation
2983400	2987320	Plus subscription service that provides more choice to customers across three membership
2987320	2988680	tiers globally.
2988680	2990760	So there's PlayStation Plus essential.
2991480	2998680	What you have today, $9.99 a month or 60 bucks a year, online multiplayer, two free games
2998680	3002200	a month, exclusive discounts and cloud storage.
3003400	3007000	Yeah, they did slightly cut that corner, didn't they?
3007000	3009720	But I think haven't they been on two or were they on three?
3010920	3011640	I don't know.
3011960	3013880	It's it's pitiful.
3015160	3021160	Well, to be fair, a lot of the games that they've offered have been kind of silly anyway.
3021160	3022840	Like what was what was the one?
3022840	3027400	It was the one that was a launch game for the PS5 Godfall.
3027400	3028680	Was that what it was called?
3028680	3032680	And like they did the it in the demo.
3032680	3036600	Yeah, it was like the demo enhanced or whatever was like the giveaway.
3036600	3037640	So yeah.
3039320	3042520	Oh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says two PS4, one PS5.
3042520	3044120	So yes, it's at three now.
3044120	3047720	But, you know, three games in concept.
3049640	3051480	Now there's PlayStation Plus extra.
3052520	3053880	It's a little extra.
3053880	3057880	It's going to cost you $14.99 a month or $99 a year.
3057880	3059720	What does that five bucks a month get you?
3059720	3067560	An extra 400 of the most enjoyable PS4 and PS5 games, including blockbuster hits from
3067560	3071080	the PlayStation Studios catalog and third party partners.
3071080	3074520	Games in the extra tier are downloadable for play.
3075320	3078680	So it's kind of like in that regard, it's kind of like Game Pass.
3078680	3081240	You don't stream them, you download them and play them.
3081880	3089160	It also sounds a little bit like that PlayStation 5 library of PlayStation 4 games that they
3089160	3093080	had at the launch, which they I would assume still have actually.
3093080	3095160	So I still don't own a PS5.
3095160	3095720	I couldn't tell you.
3096920	3099160	And there's going to be PlayStation Plus premium.
3100040	3108040	$17.99 a month or $120 a year, twice the price of PlayStation Plus premium.
3109000	3117640	All the benefits from essential and extra with another 340 games, which includes PS3
3117640	3124520	games that are available via cloud streaming and a catalog of beloved classic games available
3124520	3129480	both streaming and download options for the original PlayStation PS2.
3130040	3133320	And here's the surprise PSP generations.
3134360	3138360	That one was not in the leaks that PSP would be included in this.
3138360	3142280	No word about Vita, but we all know how Sony treats the Vita.
3144120	3144600	What?
3144600	3145960	We never had a console named the Vita.
3146680	3152520	Now it is mentioned this offers cloud streaming access for original PlayStation PS2, PSP and
3152520	3158280	PS4 games and extra and premium tier markets where PlayStation now is currently available.
3158280	3160920	Because in select markets, there isn't cloud streaming.
3160920	3165160	So you get something called PlayStation Plus Deluxe, which is a little lower than premium,
3165160	3171160	but you still get the downloadable PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PSP games for play.
3173160	3174200	So there it is.
3174200	3179800	It's basically a monthly fee to access retro games in a catalog.
3180360	3186920	I really wish Sony had gone the full Microsoft route and allowed you to play games that you
3186920	3191080	still own on disk because many of us do for free.
3191720	3197880	Because now this really shows there is no fucking reason you can't play your PlayStation
3197880	3201800	and PlayStation 2 games, at least on your PlayStation 5.
3202520	3206360	Well, I thought there was a reason like the drive doesn't work with those disks.
3206360	3207960	Okay, let's just say that that's the case.
3208520	3212680	There's so many games I own on the PlayStation 3, for example.
3212680	3216520	It sucks that I can't play those digitally.
3216520	3217400	I own them.
3217400	3219320	Let me have the PSP.
3219320	3222840	Let me have Dark Sakura do her story because it's really a yin and yang with this story
3222840	3223080	here.
3223080	3226760	And I don't I want to make sure we cover both before we open it up to the viewer comments.
3226760	3227720	So Dark Sakura.
3227720	3237480	Yeah, so it looks like that the rumor going on right now about the whole cloud thing has
3237480	3242120	to do with PS3 emulation and how difficult it is with the cell processor.
3242840	3247960	Although the rumor out there is that they are still working on that emulation.
3247960	3253000	That is just what's been the more difficult thing to get across.
3253000	3264360	There is another statement on here that saying that with what they were missing from that
3264360	3268520	announcement was addressing the issue of how they were going to emulate it and why they
3268520	3271240	were only going to leave PS3 stuff as cloud-based.
3271240	3274360	But again, that's the rumor that it may have to do with the cell processor.
3277880	3279960	I'm getting some comments in chat now.
3279960	3287720	DJ Rama S says, so the top tier to get access to PS1, 2, and PSP games in a possible download
3287720	3292280	stream format, even though you may have these games anyway, that is a crock of shit.
3293800	3295720	That's from DJ Rama S in our chat room.
3296920	3300280	Mishkins in our chat says, yeah, nah, I'm not even going to bother.
3300280	3302200	Lol, I'll stay with what I have already.
3303240	3306920	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the thing to realize about a company doing an emulation
3306920	3311640	versus a group like RPC S3 or whatever, is that one is called, we have a viewer who works
3311640	3316520	in that team, is that a company needs to also support it with customer service reps.
3316520	3320040	An independent emulator team can say, use at your own risk.
3320600	3320920	Sure.
3322200	3326520	But the independent emulator team has shown that it's possible.
3327160	3331880	Although I'm well aware that the RPC S3 doesn't run everything.
3331880	3335560	I think there's a chart and it runs like 60% ish.
3335560	3339800	Sorry if I got the number wrong, 60% ish of games start to finish.
3339800	3342360	And then there's others that it runs with issues.
3342360	3347720	And I imagine it probably has to do with that cell processor, because let's be real.
3347720	3352360	There's a lot of PlayStation 3 games that probably don't use many features that are,
3352360	3358120	because there was so much that was ported between the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
3358120	3360920	There's probably a lot of stuff that barely touches,
3360920	3365240	like some of the more advanced processing features of the PlayStation 3.
3365320	3372680	And probably it's the Sony first party games that obviously tie into that a little more.
3372680	3379240	And that's the stuff that Sony most wants and needs to get working on an official emulator
3379240	3383720	for them to want to release something like that.
3383720	3385800	And that I do understand.
3385800	3391080	And I didn't look at the list of compatibility and specifically like, where does God of War
3391080	3395640	and the Sony exclusives, where do they all fit in in the compatibility meter?
3395640	3401000	Because I would imagine the problem is that the Sony games are probably the hardest to emulate.
3401000	3405800	If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but that's what's probably the hang up right now.
3407560	3409800	I'm not mad about the cloud streaming.
3409800	3412840	And granted, maybe my perspective has completely changed
3412840	3414840	because I don't have a bandwidth cap anymore.
3414840	3416840	I'm fully willing to say that.
3418040	3420360	However, I do think it's kind of shit.
3421080	3426120	That if I still have PlayStation 3, 2, and 1 discs, they do nothing for me at this point.
3426120	3429160	If I don't still have working consoles that are 3, 2, or 1.
3430120	3434440	That I ought to be able to put those discs in my PlayStation 5
3434440	3438280	and get the digital assets for it, just like I do on Xbox.
3439080	3446760	I do want to know though, how were they emulating it on the cloud unless they have some sort of,
3447480	3452040	I'm just trying to think of how they're pulling it off through something cloud-based.
3452040	3456600	It's running on like a PS3 farm type of thing that specializes in that hardware.
3456600	3457800	That's kind of what I was thinking too.
3457800	3462760	But it's still just like, if they're going to go that far,
3464440	3473480	why not just put more of the effort into improving their emulation, creating a virtual processor?
3473480	3478040	And remember this, and I think it's the same, go ahead.
3478040	3478680	Sorry.
3478680	3481720	I was just saying, it's probably the same reason that they're not emulating,
3482520	3485160	that like Planet Harrier still has trouble being emulated.
3486520	3490600	And here's the thing, and I fully own the comments I've made before about,
3490600	3494920	I do believe the PS3 ought to be emulatable on a PlayStation 5,
3494920	3497400	because they're able to emulate it on computers,
3497400	3500520	and all the progress that the independent teams have made.
3500520	3509640	However, I do understand that the PS3 was incredibly fucking advanced for its time.
3510200	3512120	Incredibly advanced for its time.
3512680	3520280	Don't forget, the US military was getting PlayStation 3s to use that other OS feature
3520280	3524200	to make those PlayStations do other things, because of the value that you were getting.
3524200	3525720	Like the network Linux systems.
3525720	3526680	Yeah, yeah.
3526760	3530120	That's why it was such a big fucking deal when Sony took that other OS thing out.
3530840	3533320	So I do understand.
3533320	3538440	Yes, the PlayStation 3 was a lot more advanced at the time than I think people remember.
3539320	3545720	Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, would anyone here be interested in a PS5
3545720	3550280	complete that has the PS3 cell processor inside the PS5?
3550280	3554360	That way, they're no longer emulating, they are just running the hardware.
3555000	3556920	Yes, I would love that.
3556920	3558840	I don't have a PS5 yet.
3558840	3564280	If they were to do a hardware refresh later this year, and they're going to do that,
3564280	3572040	and if it will run my old PS3 disks and my old PS2 disks and PS1 disks, fuck yeah,
3572040	3573400	I want that machine.
3573400	3576120	That's the machine I wanted kind of from the beginning.
3576120	3580840	But okay, maybe, you know, but now that it's been a couple years and chips have probably
3580840	3585560	But now that it's been a couple years and chips have probably come down in price and so forth,
3585560	3587400	yeah, I would actually love that machine.
3588200	3591480	And even if it's the same price a PS5 is today, I would pay it.
3592520	3594680	An all-in-one PlayStation, it's worth it.
3595640	3598120	SD100Matt says, I would camp out for that machine.
3598120	3598620	Same.
3600280	3601640	I would be glad I waited.
3603320	3604520	So we'll see.
3604520	3610680	It'd be like the, instead of just the station, it would be like the play universe or something.
3611400	3614600	Just yeah, like the PlayStation without a number.
3614600	3614920	I don't know.
3614920	3619800	That might be a little silly, but I just, the PlayStation all, I don't know.
3620920	3621880	I would love that.
3621880	3622760	I really, really would.
3623480	3626840	But I think the hardware refresh we're going to get is going to be centered around the
3626840	3633720	VR2 because I don't see why that is not Sony's big push this holiday is that new VR2.
3633720	3635960	We've already seen them sowing the seeds for that.
3635960	3638920	And I think we'll get that confirmed in June.
3639640	3642520	So with whatever media event ends up happening.
3642520	3646920	So, um, Sia Tabiri says the PlayStation hub.
3646920	3650200	Hey, bonus if it has a PlayStation TV inside of it too.
3650200	3651880	So my Vita games can get some love.
3653320	3653800	Absolutely.
3657640	3661320	Is this stuff that you like take in the morning to make yourself healthier?
3661320	3662520	That's a Vita min.
3663960	3664760	All right.
3664760	3665880	Let's move on.
3665880	3666520	In other news.
3666520	3666920	Oh yeah.
3666920	3668600	April Fool's day was this week, right?
3668600	3669080	Everyone.
3670200	3672040	And there was no, I skipped that day.
3672040	3672520	Sorry.
3672520	3677560	Well, there was, there was, I know we've all had our fill with April Fool's day and there's
3677560	3682840	a lot of people that don't like, there there's certain things on April Fool's day that aren't
3682840	3685880	funny and I don't need to retrend all that ground here, but there's a lot of things that
3685880	3686380	aren't funny.
3686920	3691720	Um, and a lot of companies get in on it and they're also not funny, but some companies
3691720	3693880	do it and it's kind of cute.
3693880	3695000	Like it's kind of cute.
3695000	3699640	And I go, okay, if we had cute shit today, this day wouldn't bother me so much.
3699640	3701880	Such as the dead by daylight one was pretty good.
3701880	3707080	That dead by daylight one, um, that had the walking dead coming to it or whatever.
3707080	3710360	Um, the Frasier pinball table was fucking funny.
3710360	3711320	Like that was good.
3711320	3712200	That was really good.
3712200	3713160	That's awesome.
3713160	3715560	And then Loki, I know, I know you have two stories here.
3715560	3717880	Can you read the one about twitches April Fool's day?
3717880	3720200	Cause I actually thought this was one of the better pranks.
3721160	3723240	Yeah, that's the thing with April Fool's stuff.
3723240	3726520	Like I hate, hate when they have like April Fool's pranks.
3726520	3729720	They're like, well, I wish that some of that was true.
3729720	3730040	You know?
3730040	3736840	Um, so they, they had this kind of these, uh, different channels that they introduced.
3737400	3739960	So like, for example, one of them was pizza time.
3739960	3746120	It's everything about pizza, eating pizza, talking about pizza, cooking pizza, um, all
3746120	3751000	that stuff, silent reading where you just watch people, I guess, read.
3751800	3754680	I heard one girl had like 3000 viewers in that category.
3754680	3755480	But it's funny.
3756280	3760520	If I had been home and not in Vegas, I would have totally done a Bible reading stream
3761080	3763640	where I was re reading the Bible for y'all.
3765160	3770200	Um, character creator where you would, you know, spend hours making a character and a
3770200	3771400	character creator.
3771400	3775080	Honestly, Shane would be a streamer if that was a real category.
3776680	3779640	I dark would have those streams every week.
3779640	3784440	I would like to think I'll pick a game and make a character and never play the game.
3785320	3787240	Chores, odd jobs and errands.
3788600	3792200	So it's, it's you cleaning your house, I guess, or doing mundane tasks.
3793320	3796440	They had one that was called literally just chatting.
3796440	3799160	There's no cameras, no mics, no stream.
3799160	3800680	You just, it's just a chat room.
3804600	3805160	That's great.
3805880	3806920	Hi, AOL.
3806920	3808760	I kind of wish some of these would stay around.
3808760	3811880	But I get that it's it's silly and maybe not the stuff that
3811880	3812680	tweets the time.
3813800	3815640	I think character creators should stay.
3815640	3816360	I really do.
3816360	3817480	I think that will stay.
3818360	3819240	But whatever.
3820840	3824760	See a Tiberian chat says one of the movie reviewers I followed did a comparison between
3824760	3826280	the book that inspired the room.
3827080	3829880	Oh, I don't I don't know if that's about the book reading category or just a different
3829880	3830280	comment.
3830280	3832200	But I thought that was about the book reading category.
3832200	3833640	So there's that.
3833640	3835400	Anyway, I thought that was all very funny.
3836520	3837960	So yeah, I'm kind of sad.
3837960	3839240	I miss that, to be honest.
3839240	3842040	So that's, that's the cute sort of April Fool's Day prank.
3842040	3845800	And, you know, as far as gaming goes, never forget.
3847640	3853160	The game that probably has transformed the gaming industry more than anything else in
3853160	3857080	the past 10 years started as an April Fool's Day prank.
3858360	3859240	Pokemon Go.
3859240	3859960	Goat Simulator.
3859960	3860460	My friend.
3861020	3863900	Pokemon Go started as a Google Maps.
3864940	3866220	April Fool's Day joke.
3866220	3866860	Don't forget.
3866860	3867660	Well, yeah.
3867660	3868620	What did they do for?
3869340	3870860	I didn't see what Google Maps did.
3870860	3871660	Did they do anything?
3871660	3873260	Oh, I didn't see what Google did this year.
3873260	3874540	No, I mean, I was kind of busy.
3874540	3877820	Well, actually, my favorite dating sim started off as a joke, but I don't think it was an
3877820	3878620	April Fool's joke.
3880220	3883580	Now, that'd be funny as a dating sim baked in the Google Maps.
3885660	3889980	Oh, I see a Tiberi says it was an April Fool's prank he was describing overall.
3890060	3890540	I get it.
3890540	3891260	I get it.
3891260	3893500	So very nice.
3893500	3893820	All right.
3894780	3895580	Anyway, what else?
3895580	3897420	What else was going on on Twitch, Loki?
3898620	3903500	Well, apparently the Twitch had the pause their boost feature.
3906460	3909740	Because it allows you to boost certain streams.
3909740	3911820	I think you have to pay for that to promote them.
3912540	3917100	And porn ended up there on the front page.
3918700	3919200	Whoops.
3920700	3922700	Uh, so they had to stop doing that.
3926060	3926540	Whoops.
3926540	3926780	How?
3926780	3931500	Why could I mean, like, porn shouldn't be on Twitch anyway.
3931500	3936460	So even if it got boosted, like, what's the I mean, I know it doesn't look great for Twitch,
3936460	3939340	but like, shouldn't they be kind of screening that out?
3939340	3941500	It shouldn't even be on the platform anyway.
3941500	3943820	Like, is this really going to stop that?
3943820	3945420	How's how's that?
3945420	3951980	Like, I don't know how it's probably a lot of these unknown streams, like they create
3951980	3954700	brand new account and just post porn on there.
3955500	3958780	And then boost the channel to be like, haha, it's on the front page.
3961100	3962140	I don't know what it takes.
3962140	3967420	Like, if you have the paper boost, and then you also have to have like so many viewers.
3967420	3969340	I mean, I don't know.
3969340	3971180	I mean, like in the screenshot here, let's see.
3972220	3973660	How many people do they have watching?
3974620	3976460	Uh, several thousand.
3976460	3977020	Let's see here.
3978060	3978940	I can't see.
3980940	3983740	It does not say what it is.
3984380	3988140	And they put, you know, obviously that the game they're playing is like Grand Theft Auto
3988140	3988780	5 or something.
3989340	3989580	So.
3991260	3991740	Interesting.
3991740	3995020	They're just they're just going to need to screen the people that they allow to boost
3995020	3997580	a little more carefully, like somebody at Twitch.
3997580	4003020	I know it's a big job, but somebody at Twitch ought to be watching any stream, at least
4003020	4007580	for a little bit before it becomes an affiliate and then only allow the affiliate stuff to
4007580	4008620	get boosted.
4008620	4010220	Like, that's really how it should go.
4011820	4012700	I don't know.
4012700	4015980	But I mean, it's not going to stop everything, but it'll stop a good chunk of it.
4017100	4017600	Yeah.
4018460	4019100	So I don't know.
4020140	4022300	As soon as the terrible idea anyway, period.
4024060	4024460	All right.
4024460	4029260	By the way, I texted Shane a question just to follow up on the I said, I need to know
4029260	4034380	for OLR, if Twitch's April Fool's Day character creator category was real, would you be a
4034380	4035420	full time streamer?
4036060	4037900	And the answer is yes.
4037900	4042140	I have enough games with character creators that I could easily make it a full time job.
4044220	4047100	No, and nobody was surprised.
4047100	4048060	Nobody was surprised.
4048060	4050700	I think I think they should keep it.
4051420	4051820	All right.
4052380	4056460	Anyway, let's move on to our next story.
4056460	4057020	Who's on this?
4057020	4057740	I think it's me.
4057740	4061100	And I think this is a this is a very interesting story as well.
4061100	4068620	This has to do with Bungie and going after a group that their day needs to fucking come
4068620	4069100	already.
4069100	4072860	And I'm talking about copyright trolls on YouTube.
4074220	4080060	We all know YouTube's copyright claim system gets inundated with bogus takedown requests.
4080060	4085740	And we know the worst part about YouTube, a platform I've been critical of on this program.
4085740	4089740	That doesn't mean I won't use it, or that I haven't even posted content on there or
4089740	4090780	won't ever in the future.
4091660	4096540	But I'm allowed to say this is the worst part of YouTube is that YouTube airs against the
4096540	4097100	creators.
4098300	4102700	Always, because they allow these bogus takedown requests to go through.
4102700	4105820	And then the creator has to appeal it every time.
4106860	4112300	Well, maybe it's gonna maybe finally some comeuppance is going to come for these copyright
4112300	4112700	trolls.
4112700	4114380	And it's thanks to Bungie.
4115260	4122940	The game studio sued 10 anonymous people for allegedly leveling false DMCA claims against
4122940	4126620	Destiny 2 creators on YouTube, even Bungie itself.
4127660	4134220	There is a hole in YouTube's DMA security, according to the company that let anyone claim
4134220	4139420	to represent a rights holder, letting any person anywhere abuse the system to suit their
4139420	4139900	own ends.
4140700	4145580	Apparently, there was a Gmail account created in mid March that was supposed to mimic the
4145580	4147820	developers copyright partner CSC.
4148540	4154300	They then issued DMCA takedown notices falsely claiming to represent Bungie, trying to fool
4154300	4158460	creators with another account that insisted the first one was fraudulent.
4159420	4166220	So YouTube didn't bother to investigate at all and slapped producers with copyright strikes,
4166220	4168140	and people had to remove videos.
4168540	4171740	Now, YouTube has corrected the error since.
4171740	4176540	But let's be real, this is only because Bungie got involved and made a phone call.
4178300	4178940	Exactly.
4178940	4184140	They thankfully, since YouTube and Google are affiliated, they were also able to suspend
4184140	4185580	those Gmail accounts.
4185580	4189740	So not very bright on the part of the YouTube trolls.
4190780	4194140	But Bungie called it a circular loop of support.
4194140	4195580	Oh, yeah, this is crazy, too.
4195820	4202540	Google said they had the global finance director email key personnel, and Google still would
4202540	4205020	not share info to identify the fraudsters.
4205820	4211500	So Bungie did a DMCA subpoena to help identify the attackers and punish them.
4212380	4216300	Damages up to $150,000 for every false takedown notice.
4216300	4223820	So yeah, YouTube in a comment said we take abuse of our copyright takedown products and
4223820	4227660	abuse of our copyright takedown process seriously and terminate them.
4227660	4228300	No, you don't.
4228300	4232620	And terminate tens of thousands of accounts every year for violating our policies, which
4232620	4235900	prohibits submitting false information in a takedown request.
4235900	4238700	We'll continue our work to prevent abuse of our systems.
4238700	4242860	And we're committed to taking appropriate action against those who knowingly misuse
4242860	4250620	our tools, then reveal her, expose her, drag her YouTube, tell Bungie who it is, give them
4250620	4255420	everything they need to know without having to go through the courts and mess up that
4255420	4256220	system.
4256220	4260540	I, for one, am glad that Bungie is putting their foot down on behalf of their content.
4260540	4266140	This is this is big ups on Bungie because they are sticking up for their content creators
4266140	4269420	who have stuck by them covering Destiny 2 this whole time.
4269420	4273740	So let's let's give kudos to Bungie because they're they're pouring money into their
4273740	4275980	legal team to make this happen.
4275980	4279180	And maybe change will finally happen because of what Bungie is doing.
4281420	4285500	So I can't wait to see these YouTube copyright trolls get their comeuppance.
4285500	4289580	Then again, I thought the Twitch hate raiders were supposed to get their comeuppance.
4289580	4292060	And I haven't heard anything following on that.
4292060	4295580	But I suppose it's supposed to be important to the front page now with boost.
4295580	4302540	Well, honestly, honestly, I will take that any day of the week versus the hate raids.
4303500	4305100	Give give me porn.
4305100	4309500	Honestly, porn, porn, porn, porn all day, every day versus the hate raids.
4310220	4311820	So all right.
4313580	4317260	By the way, going back to the earlier story, but an important footnote, Bobby Blackwolf
4317260	4322460	in our chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network points out Google declined to participate
4322460	4324540	in April Fool's 2022.
4324540	4325420	That's interesting.
4325420	4326940	They usually go all out.
4326940	4330460	I wonder if they were worried the current state of the world and, you know, everything
4330460	4332780	going on with Ukraine and COVID and stuff.
4332780	4335420	Maybe they just decided it wasn't a good taste this year.
4335420	4335920	I don't know.
4336380	4337020	It's interesting.
4339820	4345580	Tiger Claw in chat says, I wish YouTube did something about people posting spoilers on
4345580	4346780	the recommend section.
4347340	4349260	Oh, is that of course, it's a thing.
4349260	4350540	Why am I sitting here asking?
4350540	4352060	That's of course, it's a fucking thing.
4352700	4357740	I just I've never I also don't follow a lot of movies and I don't watch a lot of YouTube's
4357740	4358780	about movie culture.
4358780	4361420	And that's so I've just never fallen in that trap.
4361420	4364140	But that doesn't surprise me, sadly.
4365180	4366220	Yikes on bikes.
4366780	4368940	Mike Deaf says that's more on the creators.
4370140	4374940	It is, but that doesn't mean that action shouldn't be taken against them for not using spoiler
4374940	4375580	tags.
4375580	4380780	Like there should be spoiler tags that then prevent your video from being advertised in
4380780	4381340	certain ways.
4382140	4385980	So but yeah, I bet some not your video.
4385980	4386480	Yeah.
4387180	4393260	So tire classes people on YouTube are posting spoilers from Sonic the Hedgehog two and the
4394220	4397020	movie isn't out in the US yet because it came out in Europe.
4397740	4399420	That's a slippery slope, though.
4399420	4403420	So technically, the spoilers, they're in bad taste.
4403420	4405260	But the movie is out in Europe.
4405260	4407420	You know, the world doesn't revolve around the US.
4407420	4409500	We like to think it does, but it doesn't.
4409500	4414060	So but there should be there should be if YouTube had a spoiler tag, which I thought
4414060	4414620	it did.
4414620	4418540	If you do that a spoiler tag, and then those videos wouldn't show up in algorithms, that
4418540	4420060	would be a good solution.
4420060	4423020	Because people in Europe ought to be able to talk freely about it.
4423020	4424220	I didn't know the movie came out.
4424860	4428460	Why did I think that movie was still like months away?
4429420	4430460	So it's next week.
4430460	4432860	I showed you how much I follow movies anymore.
4432860	4440060	I do really want to see the Jamie Lee Curtis, Michelle Yo, everything everywhere all at
4440060	4440540	once.
4440540	4441260	I think it's called.
4441260	4442860	I really want to see that.
4442860	4445820	I haven't really wanted to see a movie in a very long time.
4445820	4450460	I really want to see that because a Michelle Yo is a goddess.
4450540	4452940	B Jamie Lee Curtis also goddess.
4452940	4455340	C and she was very nice in person.
4455900	4461500	I did not know that kid from the Goonies got back into acting, but apparently he's in that
4461500	4462220	movie.
4462220	4463420	Which kid from the Goonies?
4464460	4466460	He was his name, Data.
4467820	4468620	Oh, yeah.
4469900	4471580	Yeah, he played that character.
4471580	4472460	Yes, yes.
4473180	4474940	So and he's in that movie.
4474940	4479500	And there's a whole piece I saw on Apple News or something about how he's come back to acting
4479500	4480620	after 40 years.
4480620	4483020	And just the cinematography in that movie looks really good.
4483580	4488300	So, oh, Tiger class says K Hui Quan.
4488300	4489660	I'm sorry if I mispronounced that.
4489660	4489820	Thank you.
4489820	4490060	Did you?
4490060	4491500	Rama said the name there.
4491500	4494460	Tiger points out he was also short round in Temple of Doom.
4495100	4495980	So true.
4495980	4497500	Yeah, very true.
4498620	4499580	Anyway, Dr. Jones.
4499580	4501580	Yeah, I think it's cool that he came back after all these years.
4501580	4503660	But anyway, I really want to see that movie.
4503660	4507420	So maybe I'll go to the movies next week.
4507420	4507740	We'll see.
4508620	4509260	I'd like to go.
4509500	4513420	I want to see that terrible Morbius movie just because I love bad movies.
4513420	4516860	I have not heard a good thing about that movie.
4516860	4518220	Isn't Jared Leto in that movie?
4519020	4521260	Yeah, apparently he was the good part of it.
4521260	4523260	I cannot fucking stand it.
4523260	4524860	And here's the ironic thing.
4524860	4529820	It has nothing to do with all these stories about what a horror he is on set and all these
4529820	4530060	things.
4530620	4532620	I mean, not to discount any of that.
4532620	4536540	I'm just saying I've never liked him as an actor, period.
4536540	4539980	So I just I have no interest in that movie.
4539980	4541980	But I am like you, Dark Sakura.
4542540	4546940	When I hear a movie is a gigantic fucking train wreck of a film, it does make me a little
4546940	4547980	more interested in it.
4549020	4550620	It's not in a good way, though.
4550620	4557420	It's just in a just like, I don't think it's in like, it's so funny because they're trying
4557420	4558460	to take themselves seriously.
4558460	4559260	But it's awful.
4559260	4561980	But like, it's more of just like, it's just awful.
4561980	4568620	S2100 Matt in chat says, speaking of movies, so sad about about Bruce Willis.
4568620	4569180	Yes, it is.
4569980	4571980	That is very, very granted, though.
4573260	4575580	He's been acting for a long time.
4578220	4580540	I'd say he's had a pretty great career.
4580540	4586140	Yeah, there's there's a lot of films to go back and celebrate, but it's it's still hard
4586140	4590620	when you know, one of the all time greats, you know, has to walk away, not of their own
4590620	4591820	decision, essentially.
4591980	4597900	Well, whether or not it's a great or anything, it's it's a hard illness to have.
4597900	4598620	Oh, sure.
4598620	4599120	Sure.
4599740	4601660	I draw a lot of comparisons to Tim Curry.
4602220	4606460	In that regard, you know, Tim Curry should have been able to make a lot more movies.
4606460	4610140	Unfortunately, he had the stroke and we all know he hasn't been the same since.
4611180	4615340	It's a blessing that we've been able to see Tim Curry in limited capacity and things like
4615340	4616380	animation.
4616380	4620780	I know he did a cameo in that Rocky Horror remake, and that type of stuff.
4620780	4628780	But I think we all know and I hope that Bruce Willis will be able to still be able to show
4628780	4630060	up here and there.
4630060	4632700	But I imagine he's already been doing that.
4632700	4633980	He can't anymore.
4633980	4637180	It really he's beyond being able to act anymore.
4637180	4637500	That's really sad.
4637500	4642220	He's been doing a lot of like straight to Netflix type videos and they've been all bad.
4642220	4643660	And he's been no anime.
4643660	4648460	And and that was the thought is like he's got to have something, you know, up with him
4648460	4651580	because they've been you could see him with an earpiece that they're feeding him lines
4651580	4653340	and stuff, and he's just not kind of there.
4653900	4657340	And like that was kind of like, is he had dementia and what's going on?
4657340	4658620	And they were close.
4658620	4664060	But yeah, he's done a lot of movies, like a lot, a lot, a lot of movies recently, which
4664060	4668060	is probably just trying to get the money for his kids, which is noble by all means.
4668060	4670860	But yeah, I think he's done.
4670860	4675340	I think it's just it's this time to retire.
4675340	4680620	Well, then be sure to buy the fifth element on Blu-ray and the six cents on something
4680620	4683900	is that get get him those residual checks if you.
4683900	4684140	Right.
4684140	4684620	Yeah, yeah.
4684620	4686060	Those movies, by all means.
4686060	4686300	Yeah.
4686300	4687100	Support that stuff.
4687100	4690620	Don't support the stuff that's on Netflix where it's just like clearly phoned in.
4690620	4692700	They have body doubles and all sorts of craziness.
4694220	4695020	Not that stuff.
4696860	4698620	And every Christmas, watch Die Hard.
4699900	4700540	All right.
4700540	4702540	Anyhow, you know what I watch on Christmas, though?
4703420	4704780	I watch Batman Returns.
4704780	4705340	That is my favorite.
4705340	4706220	I watch Gremlins.
4707340	4712460	OK, anyway, let's move on from Christmas to our next story, Dark Sakura.
4714780	4724140	OK, so in other news, there is a rumor I'm going to put this on the rumor mill, but they
4724140	4727660	think that eight Xbox Game Pass games have been leaked online.
4728380	4734780	And so the list, I mean, it is a it's all the same family of games except for one.
4734780	4740460	It's Call of Duty, Black Ops Cold War, Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, Diablo
4740460	4746300	2 Resurrected and then Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes,
4746300	4753660	The Phantom Pain and Metal Gear Survive, which I mean, none of those are really surprising.
4753660	4759660	I mean, maybe the Konami ones are, but they're soon to be acquisition of Konami.
4761500	4766060	But at any rate, they're leaked for this month for April.
4766060	4768780	So we'll see if it actually comes to pass.
4768780	4769580	They call it used to have.
4769580	4774380	Yeah, that makes sense because they own Activision or they're going to be owning Activision.
4774380	4776620	Yeah, the first half makes a lot of sense.
4776620	4779740	And Diablo 2 Resurrected will make a lot of people happy, that's for sure.
4780700	4783100	Yeah, including me ish, although.
4784380	4786140	I still know you like your Diablo.
4786140	4786620	I do.
4786620	4792940	But you also know I have not had the battle net thing installed since a lot of this Bobby
4792940	4793740	Kotick stuff.
4793740	4802860	You know, it was still not I did buy Diablo 2 Resurrected, but I got worse after that.
4802860	4807660	And I just I haven't been able to play it in good faith now that Microsoft's in the picture.
4808460	4809020	I don't know.
4809420	4814380	Again, you kind of have to there's bad and good and everything, I suppose.
4814380	4816060	I don't know if I'll end up playing it or not.
4816060	4819740	I probably will, because at least I see the finish line now.
4820540	4825020	I see that there will come a day where Microsoft, well, I guess legislators are trying to stop
4825020	4825500	it.
4825500	4827420	And oh, that we didn't get to that.
4827420	4829580	I think that was two weeks ago on the canceled show.
4830140	4834140	But did you guys hear that stuff about how some of the senators and I think Bernie was
4834140	4839900	one of them and some of the other senators came together to basically say they oppose
4839900	4842620	the Microsoft Activision Blizzard thing.
4842620	4844540	But it's not for the reason you think.
4844540	4848380	It doesn't sound like it's for the reason that Microsoft would be too big a player.
4848380	4849660	They're pissed off.
4849660	4854460	Basically, the Bobby Kotick's getting a payday and that all these executives are getting
4854460	4857180	a huge payday out of this and they don't deserve it.
4858140	4860220	I know that was a thing in the news recently.
4860220	4860460	Yeah.
4860460	4866380	And I'm like, OK, like as much as I think I'm cool with Microsoft, because like Microsoft
4866380	4872140	taking them over means the end of Bobby Kotick and that part I support.
4872140	4874940	I think the senators raise an excellent point.
4876220	4877580	Why are they getting all this money?
4877580	4881580	I think it made a lot of the rest of us feel dirty about this whole acquisition.
4881580	4888140	So, fuck, if we get if we get both sides of this, like Microsoft can get them and the
4888140	4890220	senators are able to somehow cancel the payout.
4890220	4892620	I don't even know if that can happen or if it would even work.
4892620	4894300	But in my brain, it's going to.
4894300	4896300	That would be the best possible scenario.
4897420	4898380	That would be amazing.
4898380	4899340	That would be amazing.
4899980	4901740	That would make me proud to be an American.
4903740	4904140	For once.
4904140	4905740	At least we have something at that point.
4908300	4916140	Anyway, but yes, the Konami inclusions, I would say they are surprising, but at the same
4916140	4918460	time, I also am not surprised.
4918460	4924700	OK, we all know Konami's business is in slot machines, pachinko, gambling, you know, our
4924700	4927580	machines, machines in arcades and casinos.
4927580	4930140	They've seen the rights for their games for terrible sequels.
4930140	4935900	Yeah, as far as their video games go, it is about whoring, literally whoring them out
4935900	4939820	on the corner for whoever's willing to turn tricks for them.
4939820	4946140	And if that is putting them into classic game archives to release on consoles like
4946140	4949180	the Castlevania Advanced Collection, then so be it.
4949820	4957340	If that is to whore a good Metal Gear Solid game and some bad ones for Microsoft Game
4957340	4959020	Pass to get some checks there, too.
4959020	4959740	Hey, great.
4960460	4965180	Will I download Metal Gear Survive just because it's free and I can?
4965260	4970300	And like I told Dark Soccer earlier and the rest of you, I will play I will go not only
4970300	4972220	go see a movie because it's so bad.
4972220	4974460	I will play a game because it's so bad.
4974460	4980540	So I'm looking forward to playing Metal Gear Survive because it won't cost me anything.
4980540	4983900	That Avatar game that came out like an age ago.
4985020	4986540	And I actually enjoyed it.
4986540	4993580	Yeah, kind of Questbuster in chat does want to point out it's not just executive pay either
4993580	4995900	with the senators versus Activision thing.
4995900	5001340	They were concerned that the deal, quote, threatens worker led demands for accountability.
5003100	5005820	I would be it's a valid concern.
5006380	5011260	I think Microsoft has replied to that concern because they have explicitly said they do
5011260	5013340	not intend to union bust or any of that.
5014060	5018060	But I understand that's Microsoft and that doesn't reflect what's actually happening
5018060	5021020	at Activision now until the merger take place.
5021020	5024620	So I think that is a good conversation to be had.
5024620	5025120	Yes.
5025660	5026160	So.
5027340	5031340	And Dark Tetsuya says there is still that Turtles collection coming.
5031340	5033580	Yes, Konami hoard that out too.
5033580	5035020	That doesn't make it bad.
5035580	5036780	It's not does it.
5036780	5038140	It doesn't mean it's bad.
5038140	5043020	I'm just saying Konami is selling them on the street for money and okay.
5044700	5049340	But that is all Konami is interested in doing with their retro titles at this point.
5049340	5050060	It's pretty clear.
5051500	5052000	Anyhow.
5055420	5056140	Let's move on.
5057500	5058540	Who's got the next story?
5058540	5059500	I think it's a Loki.
5060540	5061040	Yep.
5061660	5062220	All right.
5062220	5069260	So let's talk a little bit about some possible updates to games because we talked a little
5069260	5075660	bit how PlayStation Plus is changing and making you get into PlayStation now, which I really
5075660	5076160	hate.
5077040	5082640	But Xbox is actually talking about getting a games pass or a family plan option.
5083200	5087920	So you will have to purchase game pass for every single member of the family.
5087920	5090720	You'll be able to actually convert it over now.
5090720	5096160	I'm not sure they mentioned a cost on that, but I like the idea, especially, you know,
5096160	5098800	a lot of my kids that have access to a bunch of games.
5099760	5100260	So.
5101280	5101760	Cool.
5101760	5103760	I'd like to know what the price is, but I'm down.
5106160	5110400	And that would be for a game pass.
5110400	5111520	Ultimate also, I think.
5112240	5112480	Yeah.
5112480	5116240	I mean, I don't know if I would have a lot of use for this because it's really just me
5116240	5118320	and Alan and I aren't going to share anything like that.
5118320	5122640	So, but it's, uh, you know, it's again, just Microsoft trying to get even more people on
5122640	5128080	this, um, especially in the face of Sony now trying to launch their own product.
5128080	5131920	Although, and I can't believe we didn't mention this earlier, but there were a lot of things
5131920	5133520	to get into with that topic.
5133760	5138000	One thing Sony is, is missing from their product is day one releases.
5138000	5141840	And we all know the executives at Sony do not agree that those should be a part of a
5141840	5143040	subscription service.
5143040	5145120	They also want to charge $70 for them.
5145120	5148320	I think that decision is going to bite them a little bit, but it is what it is.
5148880	5151120	So, um, all right.
5151120	5154320	Anyway, before I get into the next story, I do want to acknowledge this quest buster
5154320	5158240	and chat says I missed the Konami that gave us things, things like sweet code and two.
5158960	5159920	I miss them too.
5160560	5164960	I hope we have all acknowledged and made peace with the fact that that Konami is dead and
5164960	5167120	gone, literally gone.
5167120	5168720	Those buildings closed.
5169280	5169920	They're gone.
5170640	5173360	So we all, that Konami is never coming back.
5173360	5175360	Those people gone to new jobs.
5176240	5179200	So I just, just as long as we all made peace with that.
5180960	5185120	And also the go back to like, when we're talking about, you know, with the differences between
5185120	5190880	game pass and Sony's PlayStation plus stuff, you know, when they make a game backwards
5190880	5196080	compatible on the Microsoft side, that's a backwards compatible game.
5196080	5198000	If you own it digitally, it's in your library.
5198000	5200640	If you own it physically, you can play it on the disc.
5201840	5206640	Sony, you can play what we give you, or you can buy it.
5207840	5208880	That's messed up.
5208880	5209380	I agree.
5210960	5214800	Important note on the sweet code and thing though, which, which is a part of it.
5214800	5220720	Like there isn't like, because what they released sweet code and one and two on the
5220720	5221840	PlayStation three.
5222720	5226880	So if you had the original discs, they were collector's items, and then more people got
5226880	5230080	to experience with the PlayStation three, but you can't play those games right now on
5230080	5231520	a PS four PS five.
5232320	5235840	I would imagine those games are going to be a part of the library.
5235840	5239440	I don't know anything yet, but I just said Konami is going to whore their stuff out on
5239440	5240880	the corner for tricks.
5240880	5244320	I don't see why sweet code and won't be there, which will be great news.
5244640	5248400	And Sony knows that's one that's going to get people to pay for the library.
5249200	5252880	But I did want to read this comment from sacred Jade, because I absolutely agree with it.
5252880	5255760	A sweet code and compilation would be chef's kiss.
5255760	5258000	Yes, that's the compilation Konami needs to make.
5258000	5258960	Get on it.
5258960	5259520	But they won't.
5261360	5261860	Anyway.
5265120	5268720	Bobby Blackwell says Nintendo was the same with virtual console, and we all wish they
5268720	5271520	brought back virtual console and got rid of NSOs.
5271520	5273600	I think the problem there.
5273600	5279840	It's not the system of delivery, but it's the fact that there are these gaps in NSO
5280400	5282560	that virtual console is only highlighting.
5283520	5289840	There are games that came out on virtual console that just Nintendo switch online doesn't see,
5289840	5294160	you know, and they've they've been making progress to close the gap, like with the mother
5294160	5295360	one and two releases.
5295360	5301200	But I feel like that's that's a big part of the problem is that we know Nintendo has released
5301200	5305040	stuff on those platforms that they can't get the third party rights to anymore.
5306800	5310480	Like, I don't understand why they don't like they could literally do both.
5310480	5316240	They could sell them virtual console and like, you could make your money back.
5316240	5319040	Like, what's a subscription to Game Pass Ultimate?
5319040	5319920	Like, 25 bucks?
5320560	5323600	Like, or not Game Pass Ultimate.
5323600	5325600	It was whatever.
5325600	5327920	Nintendo's online expansion pass or whatever.
5327920	5333200	Expand $25 on top of was a total like 40 bucks, whatever a year.
5334240	5338560	Like, there are people that will buy at least five games and you're probably charging like
5338560	5344400	at least $8 for those games, you would make probably more money than that because they
5344400	5345920	want specific titles.
5345920	5350320	They could also look at, hey, I don't want to buy these all individually.
5350320	5352800	I want to just, you know, buy this pass.
5352960	5355520	And that might make it more attractive one way or the other.
5355520	5358960	Because if you're selling games individually, you can go look at how much value you're
5358960	5362320	getting out of this, you know, subscription service instead.
5364240	5369360	And it's when when you give player choice and you also make your package look more attractive.
5369360	5371440	Like I don't understand why they don't do it.
5371440	5377200	Licensing maybe because you're licensing the rights for a subscription service versus individual
5377200	5379040	sales, but I think that can be tweaked pretty easy.
5379920	5380560	I don't know.
5380560	5384720	I just think I think we all know licensing is what's holding back Super Mario RPG.
5384720	5391040	But the thing there is, I don't see why Nintendo and Square Enix can't sit down at the table
5391040	5393520	and figure that out to get that game to come out.
5394560	5399840	But maybe Square Enix wants to make it a standalone release so they can get more money off of
5399840	5401840	it than just including it in the NSL library.
5401840	5403920	I think that's what it boils down to that.
5403920	5407360	Make a remaster or something like that and just put it out in a remaster.
5407520	5408000	I don't know.
5409280	5412880	Also, the chat is pointing out because I did bring up Sue Coden.
5412880	5415760	They did bring up Aiden Chronicles, which is still coming out.
5415760	5417680	Yeah, I actually kickstarted that one.
5418240	5419680	And I'm in the Discord server.
5419680	5422720	I don't follow it a lot, but they're still on track to get that out too.
5422720	5427280	So Aiden Chronicles will be the spiritual successor to Sue Coden in a lot of ways.
5427280	5428640	And that'll be really exciting.
5428640	5434000	So all right, I want to get to one more story here before we get to the classic game of
5434000	5435920	the week, although there's a little bit of a twist.
5435920	5437040	I'll tell you about that in a moment.
5437840	5443600	And that is about the game Loop Hero, which has been covered a lot lately.
5443600	5451440	It's kind of an interesting little RPG that has a retro PC look to it, but it's actually
5451440	5453520	made by a Russian developer.
5453520	5457360	And at this point, with everything going on in the world, that Russian developer has said,
5458880	5459680	just pirate it.
5460640	5466960	This was from a post on the social media platform VK, which I think is pretty big in Russia.
5466960	5468240	It's VK.com.
5468240	5473280	I haven't used it myself, but I always thought LiveJournal was the big thing in Russia because
5473280	5478480	I know it took over, but that is another big social platform in Russia.
5479760	5486000	The developer of the game Four Quarters was addressing Russian fans who can't access Steam
5486000	5488640	or Nintendo Switch because of all the sanctions going on.
5489600	5493440	Nobody can buy the game because all the companies are sanctioning because of what's going on
5493440	5494000	in Ukraine.
5494000	5500160	And so Steam and Nintendo don't accept payments and basically nobody can get Loop Hero.
5500160	5507200	So the developers are like, torrent it, here is a link to RU Tracker, an official Russian
5507200	5512080	torrent site, basically saying it is not known when all this will end.
5512080	5517360	Therefore, in such difficult times, we can only help everyone to raise the pirate flag
5517360	5522960	together with VPN and share the most popular distribution on the RU Tracker.
5523840	5529520	That is a translated by Google Translate of one of the tweets, if you will, on that platform.
5531440	5535680	Fans of Loop Hero are asking, is there ways we can directly support or compensate the
5535680	5536240	developers?
5536800	5541920	And due to the state-owned bank sanctions in Russia, the game developers can't cash
5541920	5543040	out their earnings.
5543040	5547920	So Four Quarters said, we are very grateful for your support, but the truth is that everything
5547920	5548720	is fine with us.
5549280	5552400	Send this support to your families and friends at this difficult time.
5553120	5559120	So as much as you know, and when we've talked about what's going on with Ukraine and everything,
5559120	5565200	that's why I'm very clear to point out this is Vladimir Putin's disgusting actions and
5565200	5567440	war that's going on that he started.
5567440	5571200	There's a lot of awesome people in Russia that want nothing to do with it.
5571200	5574720	And it sounds like the makers of this game are a part of that bunch.
5574720	5581280	I mean, that is a very big thing to basically walk away from the potential earnings of your
5581360	5587280	game because of bigger things that are going on in the world, you know, and just say at
5587280	5588880	this point, fuck it, pirate it.
5589440	5592880	So props to the folks behind Loop Hero for that.
5593520	5601760	So there's a lot of good people who are suffering over this horrible persons.
5603680	5609440	The only thing I can call it is toxicity on a major level because it's the type that it's
5609440	5619440	like it's like a humanitarian Chernobyl, if that makes sense, that so many people are
5619440	5623680	hurt had nothing to do with causing the incident.
5624640	5632480	No one had anything to do with with creating it, but it's spreading, it's destroying lives
5632480	5635120	and it's going to continue to hurt people for years after.
5635120	5635620	Yeah.
5636640	5637360	All right.
5637360	5641360	Well, I don't have a clean way to make a transition here, but I am just going to find
5641360	5641680	stuff.
5641680	5641920	Yeah.
5641920	5644000	We're just going to introduce our next segment here.
5644800	5645520	Let me roll.
5645520	5648480	Actually, thankfully, I have this little bumper that introduces it for me.
5648480	5649200	So let's go to it.
5659760	5665280	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5665280	5667520	out a classic and tell you about it.
5667520	5670160	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5671920	5679040	But in a 2022 twist, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a handheld electronic
5679040	5683120	handheld to spotlight as the classic handheld of the month.
5683120	5687680	So Dark Soccer, what do you what you picked a pretty obscure one this week?
5687680	5688720	So why don't you tell us about it?
5688720	5691040	It's one of my favorites, which is why I picked it.
5692000	5698000	So I picked the Puyo Lin of which I have blessed little information on that I could find, but
5698000	5702080	I still wanted to to highlight it.
5702080	5707920	And actually, I made a little teensy video to go with it, since there's literally no
5707920	5710640	footage anywhere of someone playing one.
5711680	5714720	Um, is this your is this your own music bed in it?
5715680	5718800	No, this is actually from Puyo Puyo on Genesis.
5718800	5719680	Okay, that works.
5720640	5721140	Yeah.
5722080	5727920	Um, so anyway, as you can see in here, the Puyo Lin, first of all, it coming out was
5727920	5735120	a surprise, because not many people in America knew what Puyo Puyo was.
5735120	5738080	It had never there'd never been a game in the US.
5738080	5742880	Closest thing that we had was like Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.
5743680	5749520	So when this came out by Tiger in the US, it was really a surprise.
5750400	5756960	Um, it's a little, you know, LCD keychain thing.
5756960	5759680	It was about, yay, big.
5760400	5762000	I can't find mine.
5762000	5764560	I'm ever regretful of this and I want another.
5764560	5765920	My birthday's coming up, y'all.
5766480	5776320	Anyway, um, it was released in 1997, licensed by Compile made by Tiger Electronics.
5776880	5782880	It came out in, of course, in Japan first, along with, uh, there was a Tempest, there
5782880	5785520	was a Pong, there were a few others in the series.
5786240	5789600	Um, and in Japan, it was called Puyori.
5790240	5795280	So as you, if anyone can read the Kana on it, it clearly says that.
5795280	5800320	Um, so they kept the same name here in the US and it was basically just little single
5800320	5802160	player Puyo Puyo game.
5802720	5810080	Um, what I thought was cool is that, uh, in fact, you can even see it right around here.
5810080	5813360	It's got like the little, uh, Puyo button.
5814480	5822400	Um, the, uh, but the American one basically looked exactly the same, um, just in English.
5823280	5827520	And it was, it was really a lot of fun.
5827520	5835600	I, I played the crap out of one of these at my first job here, which was working at a
5835600	5839040	GNC, which was also my last part-time gig.
5839920	5843920	And, um, and yeah, I know they're on Amazon for 30 bucks, but I'm going to Disneyland,
5843920	5845280	so I can't pay the money right now.
5845920	5852320	Um, but at any rate, it's a fun little game, you know, it's just, you know, blip blip,
5852320	5854880	you know, but I kept it on my key chain.
5855840	5862640	I, I, mine was all scuffed up and terrible by the time I was done with it, but it was
5862640	5865840	a fun, fun little, little, little toy.
5865840	5868960	And for me at the time I was just excited.
5868960	5871280	Dan found it for me at like a Walmart.
5871280	5876240	Um, but, uh, and it was, I think like 10 bucks.
5877200	5878720	Yeah, something like that.
5879280	5881120	Um, but anyway, that's it.
5882480	5884560	I think I'd like to try one sometime.
5885040	5890080	That's interesting how it kind of came out here before the games had really caught on
5890080	5893680	here at all, you know, before Puyo Puyo was the thing here.
5893680	5894800	I think that's interesting.
5894800	5897520	So, I mean, yeah, it was a big surprise.
5897520	5902000	And now for, for me, I mean, Dan and I had been importing games forever and I had copies
5902000	5902640	of Puyo Puyo.
5903280	5908880	And so when, when Dan found that and gave it to me, I mean, we were newly together at
5908880	5911120	this time too, but I was delighted.
5912000	5917200	And yeah, they're, they're just really cute, fun, little, little LCD things.
5917200	5918640	Good way to waste some time.
5918640	5924000	I mean, we had the Mean Bean Machine and, um, um, Kirby's Avalanche at this point.
5924000	5925200	That's what I said right at the beginning.
5925200	5925760	Yeah.
5925760	5929440	But, um, yeah, a lot of people didn't associate that with Puyo Puyo, of course.
5929440	5930880	So, yeah.
5930880	5936320	Well, because like I also said, nobody here had seen Puyo Puyo except those other two
5937280	5938400	iterations of it.
5938400	5940080	So, all right.
5940080	5944160	Well, there it is your classic handheld of the month.
5944160	5946400	And let's hear it for five minutes of video editing.
5946400	5946720	All right.
5949280	5949600	All right.
5949600	5951840	Hey, I did that Ken Burns effect by hand.
5951840	5952320	Okay.
5952320	5952640	All right.
5954720	5961680	Let us travel around the industry rapidly in some rapid fire news and we'll go to Loki.
5963120	5963520	All right.
5964240	5968480	So certain things off, um, it's funny.
5968480	5970480	I actually played this game a while back.
5970480	5977200	The original, uh, you may, this is a long forgotten platformer game that was put out
5978480	5978960	gax.
5979840	5985120	He was a quick witted gecko who used to have a bunch of different, like, uh,
5987200	5990640	pop culture, um, one liners and whatnot.
5990640	5994800	So there was supposed to be a spinoff for the series called Gex Jr.
5995680	6000240	And apparently a prototype demo was made for that back in 2001.
6000240	6005920	And now that has leaked out because obviously it never became a thing, but that's pretty
6005920	6008320	awesome that you can actually, uh, check it out.
6009360	6015120	Um, I probably will not be checking it out because I've unfortunately don't love gex
6015120	6016480	as much as I used to anymore.
6017360	6018240	That's just the thing.
6018960	6028000	Um, and then of course, uh, to try to get you excited about the, uh, was it paramount
6028000	6034960	plus they're going to be releasing the first episode of halo, uh, free to watch on YouTube
6034960	6035760	for one week.
6036400	6038800	And you can decide whether you want to subscribe to the series.
6038800	6043200	I hear that the series falls really after the first episode.
6043200	6044720	So that's what I hear too.
6044720	6048800	I guess the they'll, they'll trick you.
6048800	6054160	They come in and, you know, come in there and watch it and disappoint you with episode
6054160	6058800	two, but you can check out the first episode that first week is already in progress.
6058800	6060480	March 31st was the first day.
6060480	6063760	So you got to get on that quick if you want to watch it.
6063760	6069120	So, um, Bobby Blackwell, Bobby Blackwell in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network
6069120	6070960	says they did this with Picard too.
6070960	6074080	The first episode is, was on YouTube or is on YouTube.
6075200	6080080	I believe they did that with, um, drag race all star six too, which was also a paramount
6080080	6081040	plus exclusive.
6081040	6083440	So they're doing that with a lot of the paramount plus shows.
6083440	6086480	I am just not interested in paramount plus at all.
6086480	6091040	I, I actually will say it's one of the better subscription services.
6091040	6092800	Um, but I'm also a Trekkie.
6093520	6097200	So, but, uh, what they've been doing in Picard.
6097200	6099280	Cause I hear that show is not great.
6099280	6102800	I'm not up to current on that as much as I just said.
6102800	6104240	I can't completely the opposite.
6104720	6104960	Yeah.
6104960	6108640	I I'm not up to speed on season two yet, so I can't tell you.
6108640	6109920	So, um, yeah.
6109920	6114160	And as far as a lot of the reality garbage, well, the one thing that did piss me off about
6114160	6120240	paramount plus was that they pulled the international versions of survivor, which yeah, the, the
6120240	6122960	Australian version of survivor is so fucking good.
6122960	6125280	Like I think Jeff probes just didn't want the competition.
6125840	6127200	So anyway, all right.
6127200	6128560	Uh, dark soccer, what do you have?
6128560	6135760	Uh, the Nintendo direct came with a very sad announcement.
6135760	6140720	Well, you can take it both ways, but breath of the wild two has been delayed to spring
6140720	6142000	2023.
6142640	6146480	They did release though, another trailer that people are already picking apart.
6147200	6150480	Um, like, did you see the state of the master sword?
6150480	6152720	It looked like it had been eaten by acid.
6152720	6153760	It was pretty crazy.
6154240	6160720	But anyway, I'll Numa, um, issued an apology and, uh, the, I would rather it be delayed
6160720	6164480	and be good then come out on time and be terrible.
6165440	6173600	So anyway, um, moving on, uh, there is a, uh, switch online.
6173600	6176320	NES SNES collections are been updated.
6176880	6182000	Earthworm Jim to dig dug two and Mappy land are on the list.
6182800	6187440	Um, I, I freaking love all things Mappy.
6187440	6189680	Mappy land is a weird little game though.
6189680	6193760	Um, but it, it's fun to have a few more on there.
6193760	6195760	Although dig dug two is not super great.
6195760	6199040	Mappy lands kind of, it's, it's not map.
6199040	6200320	I mean, it's Mappy, but it's not.
6200320	6202000	It's not, it's, it's Mappy world.
6202000	6203920	Well, I mean, there was also, that was around the same era.
6203920	6205360	They were doing things like pack land.
6205360	6205760	Yeah.
6205760	6206080	Yeah.
6206080	6206880	And all of that.
6206880	6211600	So, um, Japan got something kind of cool too.
6211600	6213040	I forgot what it was in the moment.
6213040	6214720	Um, dark to see, what was it?
6214720	6217600	Japan got, cause they got something kind of interesting
6217600	6218880	instead of earthworm Jim too.
6219600	6221840	Um, they got a different title.
6221840	6225360	Uh, dig dug two is weird.
6226080	6228000	It's one of those games where it's just like the sequel has
6228000	6229280	nothing to do with the original.
6230080	6231920	And that's what is kind of weird about it.
6231920	6235360	Um, well, I'll, I'll be perfectly honest.
6235360	6238000	You know, I've got that little arcade one up.
6238000	6240560	That's got a dig dug and dug dug two on it.
6241360	6245360	And I'm actually trying to, I'm considering rehoming it.
6247120	6248480	You said it's an arcade one up.
6249520	6251920	Well, it's, it's not an arcade.
6251920	6253520	I don't think it's an arcade one up.
6253520	6256480	It's one of those little mini desktop.
6256480	6257840	Oh, I know what you're talking about.
6257840	6258800	What else is on it?
6258800	6260080	Is it just those two?
6260080	6261200	Dig dug and dig dug two.
6261200	6262320	Oh, I thought it was.
6262320	6266400	But we got the, the one that's got the bunch more machine,
6266400	6267520	the much more games on it.
6267520	6268640	Dan found one.
6268640	6272800	And then we also have the one with Galaga and Galaga 98 on it.
6274240	6276560	I may or may not be interested in that actually.
6276560	6278400	Cause I love to talk the original.
6278400	6282880	Yeah, we should talk, but, but I'm also just looking at getting an Amco machine.
6282880	6284560	So that has everything in it.
6285120	6285620	All right.
6286080	6291120	Um, Harvest Moon is the game that Japan got instead of Earthworm Jim too.
6291120	6292160	I looked at that one.
6292160	6293120	Oh, they got the better deal.
6293120	6296960	I, I, I don't, well then again, I'm not the biggest fan of Earthworm Jim.
6296960	6299440	So, but it's, it is very America.
6299440	6299940	Yeah.
6300320	6300720	All right.
6301360	6301600	Yeah.
6301600	6306080	A game that burps the title and the introduction is very American, I guess.
6306720	6307360	All right.
6307360	6310800	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some new games
6310800	6314000	coming to a store shelf or a digital storefront near you.
6314000	6314500	Loki.
6315360	6315680	Yes.
6315680	6320480	We have the Lego Star Wars, the Skywalker saga coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch,
6320480	6324400	PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6324640	6330480	MLB, the show 22 coming out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation
6330480	6332800	five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6334160	6337760	Corona cross the radical dreamers edition on PC, Nintendo Switch,
6337760	6339840	PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6340800	6344400	Happy's humble burger farm on Nintendo switch.
6344400	6346000	That's a horror game by the way.
6347040	6351040	The house of the dead remake on Nintendo switch and that's it.
6353120	6353620	All right.
6354720	6358320	Let's go to Japan and check out the releases over there.
6358320	6363120	Um, I think we want to be looking at releases on April the seventh, um, which
6363120	6368000	would include on Nintendo switch behind the screen and defoliation, uh, comes out
6368000	6369840	in a regular and a special edition.
6369840	6374320	And we also have metal dogs in a regular and bow.
6374320	6374720	Wow.
6374720	6375280	Wonderful.
6375280	6378160	Addition is coming out.
6378160	6382480	By the way, this is one of those like Nintendog type of games.
6382720	6386080	I don't know why they're metal dogs, but I get, Oh, now I'm looking at
6386080	6390320	screenshots and literally this game looks like Nintendogs meets Contra.
6391680	6392320	What the fuck?
6392320	6393360	This game looks rad.
6395040	6395600	What?
6395600	6395920	What?
6395920	6396880	This looks cool.
6396880	6397600	Hold on, hold on.
6397600	6398240	I need this in my life.
6398240	6399040	Stop the presses.
6399040	6400320	Stop the presses.
6400320	6401680	Is this our new president cat?
6401680	6405760	I was like, I think we have another one of those games where I need to know,
6405760	6408080	like, why doesn't this shit come out here?
6408080	6410720	Unless I just did check the chat.
6410720	6411680	I just linked it.
6411680	6416640	Um, for our live listeners over at Twitch, uh, I need this.
6416640	6418240	What is, this is awesome.
6418240	6421920	Looking set in a world after the destruction of humankind, the harsh
6422720	6424080	PlayStation two game.
6424080	6424720	Is it really?
6424720	6425280	It is.
6425280	6426240	I don't know this game.
6426240	6426800	Super old.
6427520	6430000	So they've just ported it on the switch because why not?
6431040	6433680	I'm going to look it up middle.
6435120	6435760	That's cool.
6435760	6436560	I want that game.
6436560	6436880	All right.
6436880	6437360	Anyway.
6437360	6437520	Yeah.
6437520	6439200	They have giant like, uh, guns on the back.
6439200	6439840	It's on steam.
6440480	6441120	Is it really?
6441760	6442000	Yeah.
6442000	6442880	It's on steam.
6442880	6443760	Well, stop.
6443760	6444320	Oh my God.
6444320	6445040	It's adorable.
6447200	6450000	How did I not know about this steam link in chat?
6450000	6452880	I guess, I guess some things slip under my nose.
6452880	6456160	Sometimes there's just, I've posted stuff like this on Twitter before.
6457040	6458320	Loki, everybody.
6458880	6467120	There are too many games, too many games, too many games, too many.
6467120	6468160	There are too many games.
6468160	6469760	I can't play and remember them all.
6470720	6475680	And it's one of the, and I think in the case of this game, you could probably go back to
6475680	6482080	an old episode of OLR circa 2006, where I got excited about this game before, but it's
6482080	6482960	been that long.
6482960	6485520	And I'm that old where you could show it to me again.
6485520	6486640	And I'm like, Oh, this is new.
6487440	6492800	If you want something to be excited about on the switch, there was a video I saw recently
6492800	6498640	by John Riggs who played a game called super cyborg, which looks exactly like Contra.
6499840	6501280	So you should check that out.
6501280	6501780	Okay.
6502320	6506960	I would be interested in a new Contra game because Konami can't.
6506960	6507460	All right.
6508000	6511360	Moving over to Japan's PlayStation five releases.
6511360	6514000	We have Lego star Wars is out there as well.
6514000	6517760	MLB the show 22 is also out in Japan this week.
6517760	6518720	And that's about it.
6519280	6525120	And I would read Xbox releases in Japan, but using Xbox in Japan in the same sentence doesn't
6525120	6525680	work.
6525680	6528080	So we will go to the UK dark Sakura.
6528080	6530000	How dare this only be on windows?
6531680	6532180	Biased.
6532880	6533380	Anyway.
6534640	6539760	On the fifth for the big three, we have Lego star Wars, the Skywalker saga.
6540320	6546000	We also have crisis remastered trilogy for the switch on the seventh for the PlayStation.
6546000	6548160	We have road maintenance simulator.
6548160	6549760	They're really getting into those Sims, aren't they?
6550880	6555920	On the eighth, we have the a 500 mini which I believe was on a mega computer.
6556720	6561600	Um, we also have doki doki literature club plus for PlayStation.
6562240	6565040	Also Lake for PlayStation for PlayStation switch.
6565040	6570880	We have skull, the hero Slayer on the eighth, also for switch legend of mana, final fantasy
6570880	6574720	nine world of final fantasy Nickelodeon cart racers.
6575600	6577120	And the C Finney.
6578320	6578960	All right.
6578960	6581440	We have a few more news stories for you all.
6581440	6585360	And then we'll get to the listener round table where you can call and chat with us on our
6585360	6590560	discord server, or you can send us emails to participate at orange laundry.com.
6590560	6593920	Or you can ask us questions in chat about whatever you like.
6593920	6596640	But before we get there, we have some more stories.
6596640	6597840	So we're going to start with Loki.
6598960	6599520	Yes.
6599520	6606000	So this is a story about how Epic is being sued because Fortnite stole someone else's
6606000	6606720	dance.
6606720	6610000	You may remember that we've kind of gone through this before.
6610000	6618000	And I believe that the court system said that they couldn't award damages to the choreographer
6618000	6622880	before because those dance numbers or routines were not copyrighted.
6623520	6630320	But that brings us to today, where we have now a lawyer representing the choreographer
6630320	6637120	Kyle Hana Gami, he sued epic for copyright infringement for his it's complicated of the
6637120	6638320	dance emote in Fortnite.
6639440	6644080	But he does actually have the copyright for his choreography.
6644720	6646400	So that's a different story.
6647120	6648640	Oh, I guess.
6648640	6652640	Guess Epic Games is going to have to get rid of it or settle.
6652640	6658320	But epic, but Epic Games is a poor little indie company with no money, whatever they're
6658320	6659280	going to do.
6659280	6659780	Yeah.
6660960	6666480	So they did not credit him nor consent to use display, reproduce, sell or create derivatives
6666480	6669280	based off of his registered choreography.
6669280	6675360	It is it is a bummer in a way because meme dances are a lot of fun to see show up in
6675360	6679600	games like remember World of Warcraft back when it was cool or profiting off of this
6679600	6680320	stuff, though?
6680320	6684320	Yeah, no, I get Yeah, when you're selling well is does Fortnite sell that as a micro
6684320	6684880	transaction?
6684880	6686560	I imagine they do believe that they do.
6686560	6689200	Yeah, then that's that's where it gets dicey.
6689200	6693760	And where Yeah, the director or the choreographer, excuse me, probably deserves their fair share
6693760	6694260	of the money.
6695220	6697620	Yeah, interesting thing about Fortnite.
6697620	6703700	Um, I did not realize that they the building, I knew they were taking it out for the season,
6703700	6707780	but I guess there's now like a no build mode in the game permanently.
6709460	6713940	Like where you can play Fortnite without the building element and never before have I wanted
6713940	6718820	to actually try Fortnite again more because the building was the thing I never understood.
6719620	6721940	You take the only distinct thing out of Fortnite.
6721940	6722440	Cool.
6722820	6723940	Generic shooters.
6724020	6724520	Yay.
6725460	6727380	I have no interest in playing Fortnite.
6727380	6730820	Generic shooter with Ariana Grande.
6731860	6732420	Just saying.
6733780	6734580	She's important.
6735220	6735720	All right.
6736740	6737460	Moving on.
6738100	6741300	Actually, Ariana Grande does usually have a presence on my stream.
6741300	6745140	I will admit a little less conversation.
6745140	6745860	As she should.
6746420	6746920	All right.
6747540	6748980	Moving on Dark Sakura.
6749780	6757860	Um, so the, uh, the developer of Abandoned claims, uh, they reached out to Silent Hill's,
6757860	6770500	uh, uh, the publisher Konami, evil, evil, evil, evil, um, to try to, um, to, uh, get
6770500	6771940	the license for Silent Hill.
6772180	6782980	Um, uh, they, uh, uh, Hassan Karaman, uh, reached out and the quote is I reached out to them.
6782980	6787620	I was stressed out because people thought it was Silent Hill about, about his game.
6787620	6790580	Um, it got so out of hand, you know, you're the small developer.
6790580	6791780	You've never had a big audience.
6791780	6792980	You're inexperienced.
6792980	6796100	I reached out to Konami saying, Hey, you know what?
6796100	6797460	It was never my intention.
6797460	6798420	And they were really cool.
6799140	6799640	Hmm.
6800820	6808580	Um, so, but yeah, there's people out there thinking that his game is a Silent Hill game.
6808580	6812500	Uh, and I'm like, why do you think that?
6812500	6813940	Can you not read the title?
6813940	6818020	Can you not read that Kojima had nothing to do with this internet gonna internet.
6819460	6820420	So dumb.
6820420	6822020	I mean, I don't want to use that word.
6822020	6823300	That's so pointless.
6823300	6823800	Yeah.
6824440	6832760	But anyway, um, and also, uh, there are rumors that abandoned would be canceled and the rumors
6832760	6833260	are false.
6835240	6837400	Well, it sounds like it's a pretty kick butt game.
6837400	6841800	It's it sounds like that, you know, if people keep comparing it and wanting it to be a Silent
6841800	6844520	Hill game so badly, let's be real.
6844520	6849560	That, um, hollow husk of a once great company is never going to put out a Silent Hill game
6849560	6851240	that's worthy of our time.
6851240	6857160	So, you know, why not play that spiritual successor, even if it's not actually a successor?
6857160	6857560	I don't know.
6857560	6858760	Could have had one.
6858760	6859160	I know.
6859160	6859800	But no.
6859800	6865080	I know, but no cannot is this the first in many bad decisions by Konami, but you know
6865080	6868520	what we've talked about that literally a million times.
6868520	6870040	So let's go on to our next story.
6870920	6871420	Loki.
6872600	6873100	Yes.
6873560	6877880	So this is exciting because I completely forgot about it, but apparently the Stanley parable,
6878200	6881960	ultra deluxe is going to be coming out April 27th.
6882840	6889320	So that is very soon and you'll be able to play that on the switch PlayStation for PlayStation
6889320	6893640	five, Xbox one, Xbox series, and I'm assuming PC.
6894840	6899080	So, well, I would hope because that's, I can't wait for most people play the game originally,
6899080	6900040	but, uh, yeah.
6900040	6902520	How many years from the original is this finally coming out?
6902520	6903240	That's pretty cool.
6903240	6905640	It's been a while, a long time, long time.
6905640	6909640	So I almost feel like the original can be a classic game of the week pretty soon.
6909640	6911320	So, all right.
6911320	6911880	Probably.
6911880	6912380	Yeah.
6913240	6913880	All right.
6913880	6918840	Well, speaking of classic games, that takes me to our last official headline of tonight
6918840	6924280	and the potential of a Capcom arcade second stadium being released.
6924280	6929480	Apparently the game rating and administration committee of Korea has rated Capcom arcade
6929480	6931000	second stadium for PC.
6931640	6936440	Um, the, the ratings board in Korea has kind of leaked games before.
6936440	6940840	So this is definitely one of those, Oh, there might be smoke and fire type of thing here.
6940840	6946520	Uh, this would be a followup to the Capcom arcade stadium collection that was released
6946520	6948360	in February, 2021.
6948360	6955480	Um, what's interesting about that though, is that I thought the first stadium was built
6955480	6956920	to be aware.
6956920	6959640	I mean, you, you get download packs for the first one.
6959720	6965560	Like I thought the first one was supposed to be editable enough so that they could add
6965560	6966280	stuff to it.
6966280	6969560	I don't see why they need to release a second stadium.
6969560	6970680	That seems weird.
6970680	6974840	And I don't even know if I can blame a money thing because I I'm pretty sure Capcom arcade
6974840	6978280	stadium is free and you get like one game with it.
6978280	6982040	But then of course, you know, in the great tradition and other games do this too, like
6982040	6986120	the pinball effects type of things you have to pay for all the extra machines.
6986120	6988840	So it's, it's not even really a money thing.
6988840	6993640	It's just weird that it's not all just going into Capcom arcade stadium.
6993640	6996600	I don't know why they need to have two different stadiums.
6996600	6997240	So weird.
6997880	7001800	And dark Tetsuya in our chat seems to agree with that line of thinking saying, sounds
7001800	7003480	like it might be a whole new thing.
7003480	7003960	I agree.
7003960	7006120	I thought for sure they would just expand the first one.
7006120	7007880	Yeah, that part doesn't make sense.
7008680	7015080	So we'll see what has apparently also been rated is Capcom arcade second stadium bundle
7015080	7015880	one.
7015880	7018840	So that also implies that it will be in packs.
7019720	7023960	There was a lot missing from the first arcade stadium because Capcom's made a lot of arcade
7023960	7024460	games.
7024920	7026840	But there was a lot of good stuff in that first one too.
7026840	7031320	Like I know Dark Sakura is very, very partial to Strider, the original arcade game, and
7031320	7032040	that is in there.
7032760	7035960	You know, one of the Street Fighter games, not all of them, but one of the, you know,
7035960	7038600	or maybe two, I can't remember, but that's in there.
7038600	7040440	But there are, it's certainly missing a lot of stuff.
7040440	7041960	So it'd be, it'd be interesting to see.
7042920	7044600	I wonder if they'll put in it.
7044600	7049560	Some of the games they've released before, like magic sword, they put out magic sword
7049560	7052840	and final fight in a compilation on Xbox 360.
7053400	7058920	And I think PS3 in that era, I'd be very curious if maybe they just release it again in this
7058920	7059480	compilation.
7059480	7061240	I wonder if it's not some of those games.
7061240	7066280	So, uh, dark to see it says if they put black tiger in it, I'm more than happy to pick it
7066280	7066680	up.
7066680	7067180	Yeah.
7067660	7069340	So, all right.
7069900	7074460	Anyhow, that is everything we officially had on the agenda for tonight, but it's time for
7074460	7076060	the listener round table and your thoughts.
7076780	7081900	If you have any emails, you can send them to participate at orange lounge, radio.com.
7081900	7085340	I don't think we had any tonight, but let me check with dark Sakura on that.
7085980	7087020	I could have got that wrong.
7087820	7088380	Nada.
7088380	7089340	She's shaking her head.
7089340	7089660	All right.
7090380	7093740	Usually I would fill this time with drag race chatter while we don't get emails.
7093740	7096220	But to be fair, I did already talk about that earlier in the evening.
7096220	7098140	So I'm not going to put y'all through it again.
7099500	7100140	Yes, you did.
7101500	7105900	So, um, if you guys have any questions in chat, you can go ahead and ask those over
7105900	7110460	twitch.tv slash vog network or any topics maybe we didn't cover that you're curious
7110460	7111580	about our take on.
7112460	7117980	And, uh, of course, uh, if you want to give us a call vog network.com, VOG network.com
7117980	7121180	slash discord and the green room is the place to go.
7121180	7123980	And, uh, we'll, we'll bring some callers on the show that way.
7124540	7125980	Um, throughout the cool kids.
7125980	7126780	All right.
7126780	7127020	Yeah.
7127740	7132220	So let me check, uh, and see maybe if there's any last minute stories that Loki has that
7132220	7133500	maybe we want to get into first.
7134540	7140380	Uh, Sony has laid off 90 employees because as part of their, uh, sales and marketing
7140380	7146060	staff or merchandising staff, and they're focusing more, they were apparently, um, they're
7146060	7148060	focusing more direct to consumer.
7148060	7149660	And so they don't really need those folks.
7149660	7154140	Well, if you're selling digital PS fives, that's the only way to go, right?
7154860	7155660	I guess, yeah.
7157500	7158380	So that's unfortunate.
7159020	7162860	I did like that with, uh, the free games with prime that we get with, uh, Twitch and stuff
7162860	7165660	like that, that one of the games is called Turner boy commits tax evasion.
7165660	7167100	I have that game.
7167100	7169020	It's how appropriate for this season.
7169020	7170460	I didn't even know that was pretty funny.
7170460	7170940	That's great.
7171500	7172300	I didn't know that was the thing.
7172300	7176140	I'll have to check that out and monkey Island two special edition and oblivion.
7176780	7178700	There are so many free games.
7178700	7181020	I forget to grab like all the time.
7181020	7183340	So, especially on Twitch, Twitch has a ton of them.
7183340	7183900	I can't forget.
7183900	7185580	Does Twitch still run their own client?
7185580	7186540	I'm pretty sure they do.
7186540	7188780	Like they have their own front end store.
7188780	7191260	Um, some are part of that.
7191260	7197020	Some are like, I know in this one, uh, elder scrolls four is part of good old games, plants
7197020	7199420	versus zombies is, uh, origin.
7200540	7203260	So there's, it's kind of a mixed bag.
7203260	7204380	Oh, did your MSS?
7204380	7205900	The Twitch app is being shut down.
7205900	7206700	Oh, I didn't know that.
7207740	7210620	I mean, it's not my games going hugely surprising.
7210620	7213820	That's probably like through Amazon gaming or something like that through your digital
7213820	7214700	library through them.
7215820	7216320	Probably.
7217100	7221740	Oh, you know, I, you know what I would do if I was a Amazon, I'd push it all through
7221740	7222140	Luna.
7222860	7223980	That's what I do.
7223980	7224140	Yeah.
7224140	7225740	Maybe that's what they're aiming to do.
7225740	7226220	Yeah.
7226220	7232060	I would be shocked if that isn't, if they're really running that siloed over there, then
7232060	7235820	I don't understand Amazon strategy because the smart thing to do would be to push it
7235820	7239820	all into Luna and have people install a Luna client on their desktop.
7239820	7243820	And then they can stream these games over here, but these ones in their library, they
7243820	7245660	can, you know, run for free or whatever.
7245660	7247340	So interesting.
7247340	7247660	All right.
7247660	7248220	So yeah.
7248220	7250380	Rama says the desktop app is shutting down.
7250380	7253420	I guess I'm not totally surprised, but maybe a little surprised.
7255420	7257500	Uh, any other last minute stories, Loki?
7258780	7259740	Uh, nope.
7260620	7260780	No.
7262060	7262460	No.
7262460	7263020	Sorry.
7263020	7263580	Well, let me see.
7263580	7264540	What else can I talk about?
7264540	7266460	I was trying to see if there's anything for my trip.
7266460	7269500	I didn't get into, um, I lost a lot of money.
7272060	7275100	So the, the little parody intro tonight was not a joke.
7275100	7275900	I lost a lot.
7275900	7279500	Well, not look, I set a budget and I stick to the budget.
7279500	7284300	So I know, like, I know I'm walking into this and I'm going to lose this money.
7284300	7287900	So yeah, except the one time I won a bunch of money, then I didn't lose it.
7287900	7290380	But, um, that doesn't, doesn't happen all the time.
7290940	7295820	Uh, tiger claw, bring in the receipts on the Twitch desktop app saying it's true.
7295820	7298780	The Twitch desktop app will be shut down on April 30th.
7298780	7302860	We've made the difficult decision to say goodbye to the Twitch desktop app on April 30th.
7302860	7306940	This decision was not made lightly and came from a combination of usage and user feedback.
7307500	7311900	This move allows us to invest more heavily in enhancing and adding new ways to engage
7311900	7313820	with the creators and communities you care about.
7314380	7314880	Hmm.
7316060	7318620	If you're used to using the Twitch desktop app,
7318620	7322940	we recommend bookmarking Twitch TV in your browser of choice for easy access.
7324700	7329740	But what, what happens to the library of games?
7329740	7331740	I have like a shit ton of Neo Geo games.
7331740	7334780	They gave away like 30 Neo Geo games once on there.
7334780	7336940	I'm a shit ton.
7336940	7340220	And I think that they're like, you can redeem like whenever, so.
7340220	7340720	Yeah.
7341440	7343360	So I'm curious where those end up going.
7343360	7344000	So we'll see.
7345760	7346260	All right.
7346880	7352240	Well, I guess if there's no other comments and no other thoughts, we will move to wrap
7352240	7355200	up tonight's show around the two hour mark, but that's all right.
7355200	7360080	Um, I guess it was a lighter week with, uh, me being out of town and April fool's day
7360080	7362320	kind of gets in the way of the real news for a day.
7362320	7363920	So it is what it is.
7364400	7367120	Um, but thank you of course, everybody for being here tonight.
7367120	7370480	Uh, we always appreciate your support here at orange lounge radio.
7370480	7374080	Um, if you enjoyed the show, uh, help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about
7374080	7377680	the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't
7377680	7380480	here on air, we can't get them out there.
7380480	7387040	Um, a nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, Google, wherever you found this show a nice
7387040	7389760	five star review on the platform and social media shares.
7389760	7391440	They go an awful long way.
7391440	7393680	So we really appreciate everyone that does that.
7393680	7396320	Um, yeah, I don't, I don't know what else to say.
7396320	7397600	Thank you so much for being here.
7397600	7399360	We'll do it again next week.
7399360	7402800	It's time to get everybody's final thoughts and dark Sakura.
7402800	7405280	I see you setting up ready to go with your post-show.
7405280	7407040	So what's your final thought tonight?
7407680	7408640	I need chocolate.
7409920	7416320	Also, also, also I am 56 followers away from 500 and I'm so excited.
7416320	7417200	Oh, good luck with that.
7417200	7418640	I know you've been pushing to get that.
7418640	7424080	It's, it's tough because it's like, it's, it's hard to, you know, get people to like
7424080	7428000	follow me cause I'm close, you know, it's hard to do that, but you just have to kind
7428000	7430880	of keep the pedal to the metal and hope it sticks.
7430880	7432080	So, yeah.
7432080	7437280	And I mean, it's just a number really, but something like that for me, having been back
7437280	7440960	into doing this for a year, it, it's definitely something that would mean a lot to me.
7441520	7447280	Um, especially by my birthday, but I've, I'm, I'm putting a lot of work into this upcoming
7447280	7451760	marathon and, you know, I, I mostly, it's not like I even care about the subs as much.
7451760	7456880	I just want to have my friends around for a virtual birthday party and just, you know,
7457520	7458720	kill salty survivors.
7459280	7459780	All right.
7460240	7461040	Well, good luck.
7461040	7461520	Have fun.
7462080	7466080	And we'll see you killing salty survivors in a minute here after OLR live on Twitch.
7466080	7466800	So have a good night.
7467440	7468160	Later tater.
7468160	7468480	All right.
7468480	7469680	We'll go to Loki.
7469680	7470720	Your final thought tonight.
7471360	7476480	So my final thought is in order to access your Twitch games that you have through prime
7476480	7478880	gaming, you have to get the Amazon gaming app.
7478880	7479920	Aha.
7479920	7480160	Okay.
7480160	7481360	So there is another app.
7481360	7481840	Interesting.
7481840	7482560	Yeah.
7482560	7482960	All right.
7484000	7485680	Um, well, that's too bad.
7486320	7488160	Um, let's see my final thought.
7488160	7489440	I don't know if I have a lot.
7489440	7492240	I didn't stream at all last week cause I was gone for half of it.
7492240	7496240	So I hope to do some streaming this week of, um, I don't know what I'll play, but I'll
7496240	7498480	find some, I'll find something.
7498480	7502240	There's, there's always lots of games to catch up on many things I need to play.
7502240	7504080	So I will try to get on that.
7504080	7506720	Otherwise I was very thankful to have a break.
7507360	7509840	Uh, from, from, well, I mean, work is fine.
7509840	7514400	I don't, but it's, even if you love your job, it's just nice to get a little break from
7514400	7518800	that routine and just do something silly with my husband, which is exactly what we
7518800	7519920	did and just.
7520880	7525360	Go to, he had never been to Vegas before, so it was nice to take him to a new place
7525360	7526560	and eat some good food.
7527680	7528800	We got to Loki.
7528800	7533440	We got to go to Benihana because they don't have one here and you know, my rule, I don't
7533440	7534880	go to, I don't go to restaurants.
7534880	7536480	I can eat at home when I'm on vacation.
7536480	7539120	However, I no longer can eat Benihana at home.
7539120	7539760	So we had to go.
7539760	7542880	There's a teppanyaki place that's better than Benihana is in Roseville.
7542880	7544560	Now it's over by the hobby lobby.
7544560	7545120	No, I didn't know.
7545120	7545760	You got to go there.
7546320	7546820	Yeah.
7547280	7550480	I know that that hobby lobby, I grew up in that area.
7551040	7554320	I, and that used to be a Mervyn's back in the day.
7554320	7558880	Cause my, and I know that place very well because every Sunday my mom went to Mervyn's
7558880	7561040	and it was definitely the open, open, open thing.
7561520	7567920	Um, yeah, it's in Japan, something or other, but like we went there once and Oh, so good.
7567920	7568320	Okay.
7568320	7570640	Like it is actually better than Benihana legit.
7570640	7573520	Alan and I are going to try it cause we love those places.
7573520	7575360	So yeah, it's really good.
7575360	7579600	Like everything, just like all of the food was just so well seasoned.
7579600	7580720	It was just so good.
7581760	7582560	Um, yeah.
7582560	7585120	And, uh, pot culture says he had never been to Vegas.
7585120	7585600	Nope.
7585600	7591840	Every time I had been previously, I went to like three final fantasy 14 conventions,
7591840	7592960	but he didn't really play.
7592960	7593520	He didn't care.
7593520	7597200	That was something I kind of did either with Shane or other friends or whatever.
7597200	7601840	Uh, and then, um, I went there once with, uh, one of my gal pals, melody in the Bay
7601840	7602400	area.
7602400	7607120	Um, and we went and saw Gwen Stefani and that was just something where it was a girls weekend.
7607120	7608640	So, yeah.
7608640	7609760	So anyway.
7609760	7610400	All right.
7610400	7615360	Well, I hope you all have a fantastic week and eat some great food and we'll see you
7615360	7617520	in seven days to do it all again.
7617520	7618960	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
7618960	7619200	Bye.
