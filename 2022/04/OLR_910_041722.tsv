30000	35000	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35000	37000	Start your night now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
39000	47000	Hello, my friends. Out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47000	58000	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 910 of our show for tonight, April the 17th of 2022.
58000	63000	My name is Rob Roberts and not joining me tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
63000	68000	You might have heard last week she is taking this week off for her birthday.
68000	73000	So a happy birthday to DarkSakura even though it's actually in a couple days, but we'll still say it a little early.
73000	77000	Happy birthday DarkSakura who is currently on vacation in Southern California.
77000	81000	I think she gets to go to Disneyland and I'm not jealous or anything.
81000	86000	Not at Disneyland with me. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
87000	88000	No, I'm not at Disneyland.
88000	90000	No, you're not at Disneyland.
90000	95000	But you're in Star Wars something something in the game playing behind you tonight here on Twitch.
95000	98000	It's the Lego Star Wars Skywalker saga.
98000	99000	It is.
99000	101000	Like a Lego game which I still haven't gotten.
101000	104000	I've never actually played the Lego Star Wars games.
104000	109000	There's always the Lego Marvel and mainly the Lego Marvel stuff.
109000	112000	Why is that, Loki? Why are you hating?
113000	120000	I don't hate. It's just there's a lot of games and a lot of that stuff came out a long time ago before I started playing like the Lego games.
120000	123000	This one though is worth picking up though because it's everything.
123000	125000	So I probably will end up doing that.
125000	126000	Sounds good.
126000	127000	And I hear the combat's really good.
127000	138000	We do tape live of course every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
138000	142000	And our live chat always helps us get along through the show.
142000	146000	For example, SJ100Matt is saying, this is the broccoli farm.
146000	148000	There's no Disneyland here.
148000	158000	Checking an old OLR joke, a pre-pandemic OLR joke when Loki told his kids they were going to the broccoli farm and then they actually went to Disneyland.
158000	162000	I don't remember why you were lying to your kids, but you were.
162000	167000	I don't remember why because we want them to be surprised.
167000	171000	And they were very convinced that they were going to a broccoli farm.
171000	179000	Until we got like we got to the apartment that we were staying at and they were still convinced that they're going to a broccoli farm.
179000	183000	And then we're like, do you know where we are?
183000	184000	And they're like, no.
184000	189000	And like the house is like decorated and Disney stuff is like, well, where do you think we're really going?
189000	194000	Literally the batter horn is sticking out and the Disney fireworks are going off outside the window.
194000	198000	The Disney fireworks went off shortly afterwards.
198000	200000	Like if we had gotten there a little bit later, you know.
200000	201000	What?
201000	202000	It's the broccoli fireworks.
202000	205000	What are you talking about?
205000	209000	PodCulture in chat says, this is why there's a stock of broccoli in the show art.
209000	210000	That is true.
210000	215000	DarkSakura hit a lot of little site gags that are like show in gags in the art for the podcast.
215000	217000	And there is a stock of broccoli in there.
217000	221000	And it is a direct reference to Loki lying to his kids about the broccoli farm.
221000	224000	Was there any disappointment that there wasn't broccoli?
224000	234000	Because I'll say I'm one of those weirdos where I actually really like broccoli, especially with all the lifestyle changes I've made in the last six months or I've been losing weight and stuff.
234000	235000	You know, I will.
235000	239000	Maybe I'll eat a burger if I go to like, I don't know, Chili's or whatever, like chain restaurant.
239000	240000	I'll get a burger.
240000	241000	I'll still have that.
241000	244000	But instead of getting fries, I'll get a side of broccoli.
244000	246000	And I'm actually like kind of OK with that.
246000	250000	I mean, they're they're not fries, but they were disappointed.
250000	253000	But they were like they they were upset at first.
253000	254000	They're like, no, really?
254000	256000	We're really going to a broccoli farm.
256000	258000	Why would you do that?
262000	268000	Now, if you took me to a Brussels sprouts farm, I'd be pissed off, but why Brussels sprouts are amazing.
268000	274000	I only like them prepared like one way, and I'm sure it's the fattiest, most unhealthy way you can make them.
274000	275000	And then you put bacon all over it.
275000	277000	And that's the only way I eat Brussels sprouts.
277000	279000	Oh, so basically how I make them.
279000	282000	Yeah, you just it defeats the purpose.
282000	283000	Loki, it defeats me.
283000	286000	First, you take you take basically a whole package of bacon.
286000	294000	You cook it down and then you throw some olive oil on some Brussels sprouts, bake them,
294000	300000	and then you cook some onions and you toss it all together and pour a bunch of heavy cream over it and cheese.
300000	302000	And that's keto friendly.
302000	304000	It is. It is keto friendly.
304000	306000	I'm not technically on keto, but I'm like keto adjacent.
306000	307000	I'm low carb.
307000	310000	So, yeah, it's those types of stuff really work for me.
310000	312000	So, yeah.
312000	316000	Anyway, also happy Easter to those that celebrate.
316000	319000	But you can see I'm not doing anything tonight.
319000	320000	Loki's not doing anything tonight.
320000	321000	Did you do anything during the day?
321000	324000	Do you hide eggs for the kids or are we past that point?
324000	325000	No, we're past that.
325000	330000	They did eggs at my my youngest son's school.
330000	331000	OK, sort of.
331000	334000	And he didn't really care.
334000	338000	They got like a gift from the grandma like earlier in the week.
338000	344000	Yeah, I got to a certain point where I was just like, just give me a box of Peeps and some chocolate and I'll show.
344000	346000	And yes, I do like Peeps.
346000	347000	And you can take those memes.
347000	354000	How many times have I seen that meme posted my Facebook wall where it's like the only good way to eat Peeps and it's somebody throwing him in the trash?
354000	357000	I've seen that meme like 50 different ways.
357000	360000	Why don't you try the only way to write an original meme?
360000	362000	Because that ain't it, y'all.
362000	371000	So anyway, I like we went to we went to Funderland on Friday because they had both kids had Friday off, so I took it off as well.
371000	385000	So they went to Funderland, which is like a little teeny amusement park that's local that they have like carnival rides, I guess, you know, none of which are built for adults.
385000	394000	I can tell you that much, because I tried going on all this stuff and like it's so uncomfortable.
394000	396000	It's so so uncomfortable.
396000	399000	Like they had the teacup ride there and stuff, which is fine.
399000	401000	And I made my kids almost sick.
401000	407000	But it was just like, like I was just like scrunched in there.
407000	412000	Like there's no room for like two kids and a parent.
412000	415000	And then they had like this other one that was like this stagecoach ride that goes really fast.
415000	419000	It's like the revolution down in the beach boardwalk.
419000	426000	But like, it's just my son was getting squished against me and I was getting pushed against the restraint bar that they had.
426000	429000	It was just it was not fun.
429000	430000	It's not fun at all.
430000	431000	Play me a golf afterwards.
431000	432000	So that was fun.
432000	435000	The stream and chat says I'm eating coffee flavored peeps as we speak.
435000	437000	That sounds obviously I don't eat peeps anymore.
437000	439000	If you've been following the show, you know why.
439000	440000	But that sounds amazing.
440000	442000	I used to love the birthday cake ones.
442000	443000	Those are my favorite.
443000	447000	Bobby Blackwell says going to send Rob all the last week tonight segments on peeps.
447000	453000	Well, I'm going to send you the the clip from Billy on the street that asked, do gays care about John Oliver?
453000	455000	It's really funny.
455000	459000	Like none of them know who he is, even though John Oliver standing right there.
459000	462000	And then like you'll ask one of them, like, do you do you know, do you care about John Oliver?
462000	463000	They're like, no, who's that?
463000	464000	Do you care about Wendy Williams?
464000	466000	Oh, yeah, she's fierce.
466000	467000	It's great.
467000	468000	Look up that clip.
468000	470000	Somebody find me that clip and give it to Bobby.
470000	471000	It's Billy on the street.
471000	472000	Anyway.
472000	473000	All right.
473000	474000	We got to get into some actual video game news.
474000	476000	We're not just here to talk about pop culture.
476000	477000	It just happens.
477000	481000	We're going to talk about video game news and what the future of gaming might look like.
481000	485000	Well, it's not necessarily the future full of NFTs and ads.
485000	486000	Right, Loki?
486000	489000	Well, it's it's not full of it.
489000	491000	Yeah, I mean, they're trying with the NFT stuff.
491000	492000	So ads, I guess.
492000	497000	So there's a big deal, I guess, over this.
498000	506000	Tech that's being developed by Microsoft, I guess, but ads in games, like, does that really need to be developed?
506000	511000	Because I'm pretty sure that we've had ads in games for like the last couple of decades already.
511000	514000	Like, is this really new stuff?
514000	516000	Maybe not a couple of decades, but.
516000	522000	You know, we're almost two decades into ads in games.
522000	523000	Is that really new tech?
523000	525000	And we were really surprised by this.
525000	534000	I mean, I can remember like there being ads for the Scion in Crackdown, like, you know, it's a futuristic game and we're advertising the Scion.
534000	535000	Like, why?
535000	536000	Yeah.
536000	538000	Or maybe it's the Yaris.
538000	540000	But there was Yaris too.
540000	542000	Hey, there's some games that are just all ads.
542000	549000	There's a chuck wagon, Purina chuck wagon on the Atari 2600 that caused the video game crash much more than ET did.
549000	550000	But I digress.
551000	557000	Well, there's also like there's examples of like Advanced Warfighter two and stuff like that called it a game that has ads in it.
557000	565000	I'm pretty sure there's been lots of games where they have art assets like billboards and stuff like that, where there's an ad inside of it.
565000	567000	I mean.
567000	577000	You're you're going to hear people complaining about it because I know, like, especially with like Madden, where people feel like they're kind of ripped off in the game in the first place.
577000	588000	And they have like full like actual video advertisements and commercials in there because it's more authentic, you know, to the viewing experience or something like that.
588000	590000	But really, it's just another cash grab.
592000	599000	Let me let me get into some comments from chat because chat is wanting to tell you why you're wrong, which they are want to do.
599000	600000	So let me get into this.
600000	606000	So Bobby Blackwell in chat says it's more the delivery network of having new ads and already released game and the profit sharing.
606000	608000	You're talking about ads baked into games.
608000	611000	This is literally about new ads being injected into already released games.
611000	612000	And that's true.
612000	614000	And Matt says it's not new tech at all.
614000	616000	The delivery system is what's different.
616000	621000	Also, Microsoft willing to share the revenue from said ads with the devs for the free to play games.
621000	623000	I actually you know what?
623000	629000	I completely understand that, you know, technically this article and why it's coming up is about everything that's chat pointing out.
629000	633000	I could still look at all that and say, I kind of feel like Loki has a point.
633000	635000	Why is this everywhere this week?
635000	640000	You know, it is the show where, you know, gamers have a voice and what gamers are talking about.
640000	642000	And people are talking about this article this week.
642000	644000	And even I had that reaction.
644000	647000	I mean, I realize it's about, you know, trying to buffer.
647000	653000	And I think I think also what I really think it is, it's a way to help Microsoft make additional money off of Game Pass.
653000	658000	But I'll get into that because I know those games are not technically free, but I'll get into that later.
658000	671000	Well, it's if they want to have like a methodology, like they could basically say, hey, you know, existing developers, if you want to put ads into your games, you can a little bit easier, like kind of a API to do that or framework to do that.
671000	672000	That's fine.
672000	681000	But I was going to say, but I was saying, Loki, I think to your point and to your credit, your reaction to this whole thing is like we've been getting ads for forever.
681000	683000	We've been conditioned to this for a while.
683000	687000	Like, it's weird that this conversation is such a big deal.
687000	696000	I don't have a problem with them putting at like a billboard or something in a game, as long as it's not immersion breaking, putting ads in games.
696000	701000	If it's if it's really, you know, there's different levels of advertising in game, right?
701000	710000	There's like, you know, more immersive ways of doing it, like maybe in a sports game or something like that where you have like billboards in the background that have sponsors or advertisers there.
711000	719000	Then there's what Capcom did with the Street Fighter stuff where they plaster brands all over like the characters.
719000	727000	And then there's also, you know, possible ways that are immersion breaking where we have stuff that's just in these games.
727000	731000	I mean, are we talking about like, it depends on how they implement it.
731000	739000	And if there is a variety of ways they can implement it, people are going to express their dislike of it if it's really obtrusive.
739000	748000	So is that like, like happened with Street Fighter five, when they had those ads before the match that would be like this match is brought to you by the Street Fighter tournament.
748000	752000	You know, and it's a lot of in house stuff, too, which was really odd.
752000	754000	So yeah, that stuff was a little weird.
754000	759000	But it's a weird thing where I think we're kind of looking at this announcement about okay, yeah, great.
759000	762000	They're looking at how to get the ads and the already existing games.
762000	767000	They're looking at having some of the profit sharing to encourage more people to make free games for Xbox.
767000	769000	Okay, okay. Yeah, I get all that.
769000	779000	But it's, it's kind of about like, because it's free games, and these are free games we're talking about, I don't think too many of us take issues with it right now.
779000	786000	Like we expect that nothing in this world is completely free, and that there's probably going to be some ads in free games.
786000	793000	And if there are more immersive type of ads that don't interrupt the game, then that's actually a good thing, I think.
793000	796000	Yeah, but you know, they're not going to put it in free games.
796000	800000	They, you know, sure, it would be probably accepted in free games.
800000	807000	But you know that these developers that are these publishers that are looking to put this stuff in there, they're going to put it in paid games.
807000	808000	Well, that's where people have a problem with.
808000	816000	And to my next point, I think and again, I have I have nothing to base this off of there is nothing rooted in fact about this next statement.
816000	818000	I'm completely willing to admit that.
818000	823000	However, sometimes we like to make bold predictions here on OLR.
823000	829000	And mine is that it is that Microsoft is probably going to start using this in some game pass related games as well.
829000	835000	And you might be thinking, wait a minute, I already pay a sub for game pass, why would I start getting ads in games?
835000	845000	Well, number one, if they're not that intrusive, and they're being designed this way, so that they are on incidental billboards, and they're in sports games, and all this stuff.
845000	847000	Is it going to be that big of a deal?
847000	868000	But I think also is that, you know, another story that's going around on the blogs and stuff this week is that game pass can only really substantiate this model without increasing their price for so long, that either a price increase is going to come, or Microsoft has to look to offset some of the losses and so forth in other ways.
868000	874000	And I think maybe subtle advertising in some of their games could be a way to do that.
874000	886000	Again, I am making that up, but I could absolutely see and I think you'd be remiss not to say you could also see how they get from this point to it being a part of game pass in the future as well.
886000	889000	Now, my question is, would that piss you off?
889000	897000	If the ads were subtle, and they're billboards, sports arena things, and that's what advertising and game pass games piss you off?
898000	912000	It could if if if they're still going to be putting advertisements everywhere. So not necessarily just in games, but in the menus in in the actual Xbox, like marketplace.
912000	922000	Because right now, like for example, with like windows and stuff, you can get these different ad tiles or whatever in there will advertise different features.
922000	937000	They're talking about adding ads to windows for different things. So if they start plastering ads in the console UI, you know, if they put it in the games all over the place, if it's really obtrusive, then yeah, I'll be a little bit angry at it.
937000	943000	But most of the time, unfortunately, right now, I'm not really playing anything on my Xbox. So it doesn't really make a difference.
943000	953000	I was gonna say, I don't know if you're reading what's currently hot, but like, or you're making a commentary on what's currently happening, but like, there's already ads on the Xbox UI.
953000	970000	Right? Yeah, I understand that. Okay, we're taking like, if you're putting it there, other places like, well, listen, I've already paid, you know, I'm paying for these games, you know, I understand the games pass, whatever, you know, they're charging, whatever it is, but technically, you're paying for something.
971000	987000	And even if you bought a game, like an actual physical release, you know, it'd be kind of annoying that, like later on, we're patching in advertisements into my game that I already paid for. Like, I get it that you have to maintain servers or whatever the case may be. But it's just it seems like it's another cash grab.
987000	1014000	I mean, that's what it is. They're trying to make additional revenue for stuff. But like, who's to say you have to have like, these huge budget games like to be profitable? I mean, there are other ways to be profitable with these games without having to just shove ads everywhere. But it right now, this is all speculation, because we don't know how they're going to implement it. And I'm pretty sure they're not gonna do it a way to piss off everybody. So we'll just have to wait and see what happens. Yeah.
1015000	1038000	Um, now bonds double six and chat says if the ads break the game flow completely stop what you're doing just a TV commercial break just as the killer identity was to be revealed. Well, you know what you make me think about is one of my top pet peeves on Twitch. And I'm sorry, because this might apply to some of you that are watching, but I'm gonna as a friend, I'm going to tell you that that shirt is ugly on you. And this is what I'm going to tell you.
1038000	1062000	If you're running those Twitch ads that run every 20 to 30 minutes, like just in the middle of somebody watching your stream, nothing will get me to stop watching your stream faster. Because those things are always timed, right? It's about some big game action thing is going on. Note, there is a huge difference between that and the types of ads that I don't care about, which is, I'm getting up to go poop.
1062000	1091000	I'm gonna run an ad while I'm in the restroom, or I'm getting up to stretch and hydrate. I'll be back in a minute. Here's an ad while I'm gone. I don't care about that, because they're not going to interrupt key parts of the gameplay that are going on. When you're running those ads that are just 2030 minutes. That is laziness. That is laziness, in my opinion, laziness, to make money that you're not really getting enough to make it worth what you're doing to the audience.
1092000	1121000	Yeah, I had someone I was watching earlier this week when they were talking about like some new updates to Minecraft and stuff. And they were showing off some actually, the stream had just began. And I had already gone through ads already to get to the stream. And then like five minutes later, right as we're getting to like the good part, then it's like, Oh, we're gonna do five ads in a row ad break while you know, everything's going on. So I'm like completely missing what I came to watch.
1122000	1130000	Which is annoying, but I don't think it was necessarily this person's fault. I don't think they triggered it. But it's just, you know, twitches timing, I guess. All right.
1130000	1151000	Anyway, up next, we're gonna get to our gaming week. But first, let's run an ad. No, I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna do that to you. But I do want to point out that but not that we're doing that. But that behavior doesn't bother me as much because again, it's intentional. You know, I am taking a break from the content making to do the ad and then I'll get back to the content. And like my
1151000	1180000	non subscribers aren't going to miss anything. And see a Tiberian chat says, but what if you have to go poo every 20 minutes, then number one, eat more fiber. Number two, literally, number two, is that at least again, it's an intentional break. And it's I mean, I might still get annoyed that like, I'm not seeing much. And it seems like I'm watching a lot of ads, but it's far less frustrating than, like, you're in the middle of an action. I'm watching a Dead by Fire.
1180000	1199000	I'm watching a Dead by Daylight stream. And I know people that do this in the Dead by Daylight Committee. Again, I'm calling you out. It's lazy in the dead. And it's like, wow, I just missed how this match ended. I see the killer got a 4k. I have no idea how that happened. Because I got a minute's worth of ads when that all went down and the slugging happened.
1199000	1208280	You just have to remember if you have to poop every 20 minutes, you just use the tag for Twitch. That's frequent pooper. And then they understand that that's what they're getting into in the stream.
1208280	1237280	All right, let's go back to the Microsoft comments on that whole thing. Questbuster says Microsoft might be able to find that balance between being aggressive with ads, or fit them where it works without feeling as if they're in your face, as with EA push short video ads into UFC four that led to huge backlash weeks after the game came out. Yeah, I think I think we all know that doesn't work. And I would hope again, with Phil Spencer at the helm of Microsoft, he knows better. And that's what he's going to do.
1237280	1267080	He knows better, and they generally know better. So anyway, let's see. And bonds double six says, as Loki says, it depends on the delivery of the ads. If the ads helped me to understand how to tune up my car in a racing game. Cool. If the ads give me updates to complete tasks, that's okay. You know, and ads are in all sorts of forms. You know, somebody brought up much earlier in the chat, I have to scroll up for this one. But somebody had mentioned, oh, Sean 322 said, if you played blades of steel on the NES, there were
1267080	1291960	Konami ads between periods advertising their games. One was a mini game for Gradius. You know, I never really thought of that as an ad. In a way, I mean, it was some really good cross promotion, that's for sure. I guess you could say it was an ad. But I think most of us, especially at that time, you know, in that era found that Gradius game to be that was baked into blades of steel to be kind of awesome.
1292360	1304680	It was kind of awesome. Like that now except you know, Namco was assholes and they decided to you know, patent minigames in games like that are loading screens or something like that. So we can't do that anymore.
1304680	1316880	Hmm. Um, let's see. And then somebody else as Joe and Hunter Matt said, we'll see flow from progressive skins in fortnight. Honestly, I kind of I kind of love it.
1317040	1324440	The spokesperson for progressive anymore because I think I saw a commercial and it's like a different they'd be like, gone with somebody else now.
1324440	1351040	I think it is somebody else now. And dark to see it does point out something I thought was a story about a year ago or so at the show saying actually, I believe that patent expired. I think the Namco patent did expire on the loading screens because I remember that whole thing came up again. Not that long ago. So food for thought. So um, yeah, Bobby is confirming that the mini game and loading screen patent expired a few years ago. So just in time for no more loading screens.
1351440	1354320	That just shows you how long it's been since Ridge racers come out.
1356920	1379680	All right. Let's see. And yeah, Bobby says there's a whole cast of spokespeople with flow is the leader. Well, I bet you flow is getting more expensive. And that's why they've had to divert they had to let flow know, I made you and I can break you just as easily. So they got more people to be spokespeople as well. So that flows rate doesn't get too high.
1382040	1392440	That's what it is. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week with or without ads. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1392440	1416440	It was all Minecraft. Again, actually, there's a lot of video editing is what it was. And so I got a new episode of my hardcore series out yesterday. Along with the Minecraft stuff, I had conversations with some folks earlier this week. And so there's gonna be some big stuff coming in the summer. So excited to announce more later.
1416440	1418880	Got a big collab coming.
1446440	1476440	My YouTube Minecraft career thing, I guess, if you will. But I really I was a big fan of these these guys before. So it'll be fun to kind of join with them and stuff. You know, gotta keep moving till we get to hermitcraft. So yeah, so they'll be probably starting this summer. So they haven't made an announcement yet regarding that, but they reached out to me first. And then they opened up applications for everybody else because they saw my content, they, they actually had people that voted for me, and they were like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I
1476440	1506440	don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
1506440	1515160	Yeah, it's it's a really it's a different type of SMB too. It's more it's it's more like story
1515160	1521480	driven, I guess like they're like super organized. They've got like writers, they have a voice actor
1521480	1529640	that's basically the main narrator kind of he plays a character in the actual game, but doesn't
1529640	1534360	he's not actually playing Minecraft that character. But he's kind of like the narrator,
1534360	1539960	the head person that kind of keeps the story going. And then everybody has does their own
1539960	1544680	thing. But then they kind of work together to keep moving the story along, which is really cool.
1544680	1548520	So for you, and you're the current people you're with, if they really care about you,
1548520	1554440	they're gonna understand completely that I'm, I'm not leaving them. I'm gonna be doing both.
1554440	1557960	Okay. Yeah, I was gonna say the collab might actually be welcomed, you know?
1557960	1562920	No, no, no. Yeah. So I'm doing both for this season, because one, I'm still running our
1562920	1568440	server. So I can't really leave, you know, it's like, I'm sorry, but I would I never want to
1568440	1573000	leave mid season for anything. Anyways, you know, I want to finish what I'm doing. So what I'll
1573000	1578360	probably end up doing is since that's in the summer, by then, I'm sure my hardcore series
1578360	1583640	will be wrapped up and should be able to swing both that way. Or if I need to dedicate more time
1583640	1588760	to one or the other. By the time we get to summer anyways, like I'm gonna be out of like pretty
1588760	1593240	close to being out of things to build anyways, like I have a lot of projects going on. But like,
1593240	1599720	it's gonna get to a point where this is a very long season. So I'm just gonna run out of stuff
1599720	1604680	gonna kind of run out steam there. But I'll find stuff to work with. And it's been kind of slow
1604680	1610120	going, like we've had several people out this season. There's like, we got another confirmation,
1610120	1614280	there's somebody that's not going to play anymore on this season, because they're having a kid,
1614280	1619800	which is understandable. But it's unfortunate, like, like half the people are missing. And then
1619800	1624680	the other half, we had what my the guys partnering with me right now, he's finally come back on,
1624680	1629160	but I'm like pushing them to put out his first episode of the season that's been going for six
1629160	1633080	months now. Like, you know, whereas the other server, they're like, Okay, listen, you got to
1633080	1637320	release content once a month at the very minimum, you know, we want you to do more than that. You
1637320	1641160	have to be involved with all this stuff. And they have like a very strict guidelines and rules,
1641160	1646040	like just to make sure that everybody's focused and everybody's like excited and like engaging in
1646040	1649640	it. And that's, that's what I'm looking for is like, I need people to be engaged. And that's what
1650200	1658360	when they came to make their their SMP. It's they all came from servers where it kind of ran into
1658360	1662200	the same thing where it's like, okay, well, I'm motivated to make stuff, but there's like other
1662200	1665560	everybody else is kind of dropping off and doing something when they get it that like,
1665560	1670280	real life happens. But like, at the same time, you got to try to do what you can to just
1670840	1675640	push through and do stuff. I mean, you got to be, you're motivated to do it. And there's a lot of
1675640	1681320	folks that just aren't. So it's understandable. Neat. Very excited. Well, yeah, that's what's
1681320	1688120	coming later. Okay, awesome. I look forward to it very much. Okay, my gaming week. So I've been
1688120	1694920	playing Final Fantasy 14, which just got a patch update, and the 6.1 patch. And I've been enjoying
1694920	1698920	the new content and playing a little bit of the main scenario, I got to do the new dungeon,
1699000	1702760	which is pretty good. I have not done the raid content or the PvP yet. So I still have a lot
1702760	1708280	to explore. I got derailed from some of that I did a stream of 14 like the first night I was
1708280	1712440	playing it on Wednesday because I was doing something else on Tuesday, the actual patch
1712440	1719000	day so I can get to it till Wednesday. But then I got derailed because there was a no man's sky
1719000	1723880	update. And I know Loki will cover some of the specifics later on. But with the update is a new
1723880	1729240	twitch campaign with twitch drops. So I've been very motivated to stream no man's sky to help
1729240	1735640	people get twitch drops. So I got on that and the seasonal campaign there. So I've been enjoying
1735640	1739000	that and playing that as well. So Loki, I know you'll talk a little more about that update later
1739000	1742680	in the show. So I won't get into too many of the specifics, but it is something I've been playing.
1743800	1749160	The other big thing I should really talk about is kind of tangential to video games.
1749160	1755400	But on Friday night, Alan and I drove over to San Francisco and we went to the Symphony Hall
1755400	1761000	to see the San Francisco Symphony present distant worlds music from Final Fantasy,
1761000	1766280	which is the final fantasy symphonic show where Arnie Roth is the conductor and he's been with
1766280	1772760	this show for a very long time. I want to say he might have done the original dear friends in 2004.
1773400	1779000	If if memory serves me right, Bobby may be able to because he follows the symphony stuff a little
1779000	1783880	more than I do. He may be able to correct me there. But I know he's been a part of distant worlds
1783880	1788120	ever since they turned it into a touring show. Because you know, they did dear friends,
1788120	1791480	they did more friends, and then they turned it into like the touring show it is now
1791480	1795560	where like, you know, video games live sort of show that that model can be successful.
1795560	1801080	And distant worlds does their thing too. And I he said during the show, they've been touring it
1801080	1806040	with it since like 2007. And you know, they've been subbing different songs in and out and so
1806040	1812200	forth as you know, they go. And it was great. Like it was just nice to have a night out at the
1812200	1818120	symphony supporting the arts. It's not something you get to combine with the world of video games
1818760	1824120	that often. But I do feel like pop culture stuff is coming more and more to the symphony because
1824120	1830840	the symphony is realizing that, you know, younger Gen X, millennial, the later generations
1831800	1836120	are more interested in that sort of thing, I think, then maybe some of the more traditional
1836120	1841160	stuff that that usually funds the symphony. So it's nice when there's that kind of blend there.
1842600	1848920	So yeah, everything was great. My favorite performance that they did was they did a song
1848920	1854360	from 14. So of course, I'm a little biased, but they did Heaven's Word, they did the trailer
1855240	1860760	music and like the overture to Heaven's Word. And it has a solo opera singer that sings it in a very
1860760	1865160	high voice. And they actually had somebody doing that live and she nailed it like it was really,
1865160	1871080	really well done. So of course, I love that. And it was interesting to me how Final Fantasy 14 kind
1871080	1875000	of got the biggest crowd reaction, because he would Arnie Roth will kind of say like, this is
1875000	1879800	what we're gonna play next is what we're gonna do. And when he talked about 14, there was definitely
1879800	1888120	a lot louder applause from the crowd than maybe for any other game. Save for maybe seven. But and
1888120	1893320	of course, they played a lot from seven, because there was supposed to be my friend said he had
1893320	1899400	tickets for a Final Fantasy seven remake symphony that never happened because of COVID. It was timed
1899400	1904600	around that same time, and it ended up just not happening at all. So I feel like a few of the
1904600	1909960	pieces may have come over from that. Um, the setlist was interesting. There were some things
1909960	1914920	that they didn't do that surprised me like the opera from Final Fantasy six really wasn't there.
1914920	1919800	They had some of it in like another medley of Final Fantasy six stuff. But I was surprised that
1919800	1922680	wasn't a standalone thing anymore. But that just might take a lot of work and you have to have the
1922680	1930920	right singers to put it together and so forth. Um, Final Fantasy 13, absent. They referenced it in
1930920	1937480	the chocobo medley by showing a clip of the chocobo that lives in Saz's hair. That's it.
1937480	1943000	That was your Final Fantasy 13 representation. Final Fantasy 11, same thing in the chocobo medley
1943000	1948520	for a little bit. That's it. So those two games did kind of get crapped on. But
1949640	1956920	when you have a series with 15 games, and a two hour symphony, I understand some stuff's probably
1956920	1962360	going to get cut to the side. I was just surprised we had four songs from Final Fantasy seven,
1962360	1967720	which included some deep cuts and two songs from nine, which most other fantasy games
1967720	1973560	only really had one song. And then a real deep cut from Final Fantasy 15. I don't know if anyone
1973560	1979800	recognized the Final Fantasy 15 song. It was from the Ignis DLC, I believe at least that's what the
1979800	1986200	video led me to believe because it was all the Ignis solo stuff and then it showed the princess
1986200	1992280	and a character I didn't even recognize. So because I didn't play 15 past the base game,
1992280	1998840	to be honest. So I thought that was kind of a deep cut. But I understand 15 is the newest game too.
1999480	2005320	I would love to see a symphony that is around Final Fantasy 14. And I think the audience
2005320	2010920	reaction shows they'd be down for it too. And you know what a lot of 14 encompasses the earlier
2010920	2016360	games. I'm surprised they didn't do Final Fantasy three by doing the crystal tower
2016360	2022760	theme from Final Fantasy 14. That was they actually did a the standalone theme from three
2022760	2027320	though, which surprised me. Just because I thought Final Fantasy three was and I'm not talking about
2027320	2033480	six. I mean, three, the Japanese three. I thought that was a little bit of a deeper cut. So So yeah,
2033480	2039480	the only games that didn't get a solo piece were two 511 and 13 didn't have a solo piece. But
2039720	2046680	I sort of think five was really highlighted in the battle theme medley quite a bit. And I would
2046680	2050680	expect that two three and five would be the neglected ones because those were never released
2050680	2055960	in the US originally. Obviously, we got them eventually. But I think they have less of a
2055960	2061560	following than the other games because of the nature of how they were released. So but anyway,
2061560	2066680	I'm bitching a lot about the setlist. It's really not that big of a deal. Again, I understand 35
2066760	2071560	years of music something's got to give. I think they still did a great job. I think the San
2071560	2075960	Francisco Symphony and the choir, you know, they don't get to work with this music for a lot of
2075960	2080520	time because they're they're constantly putting on different shows. So the fact that they can really,
2080520	2085640	you know, do this music without probably a lot a lot of practice. I'm sure there was some but not
2085640	2090840	a lot a lot is really impressive. And so you know, kudos, I had a good time. And I would say if
2090840	2096840	Distant Worlds comes to your town, it's a it's a good night to support the arts, do something a
2096840	2100920	little different than you might usually do. And be in the good company of other nerds who like
2100920	2108520	Final Fantasy. So like that. Bobby Blackwell says they get one rehearsal three hours long.
2108520	2114280	That's union rules. That's incredible. That's that's barely enough time to run through the
2114280	2120600	whole thing. That's enough time to run through it all once. And then maybe iron out like the top
2120600	2128760	three rough spots. So that's pretty incredible. All right. I guess that's it for my gaming week.
2128760	2133320	That was pretty much the big thing I wanted to talk about. Oh, I did. I did go to a cute little
2135320	2143800	bar arcade in San Francisco. They have a little gamer bar in the Castro. It's right at the start
2143800	2149240	of the Castro kind of near I want to say like 17th and market. It's a place called detour.
2149240	2152600	And I never been there. I think it's been around for a few years. But because the pandemic and
2152600	2157160	everything, I haven't been there. But somebody actually offered to buy my table. So there was
2157160	2163080	like four of us at the table. They offered to buy us a game of Killer Queen. So they had somebody
2163080	2167960	to play against. And I must admit, I'd never played Killer Queen before. But it was very
2167960	2172440	obvious that because there was like only two of them, they weren't having fun playing it. So they
2172440	2176760	were like, we need more people to be able to play Killer Queen with. So they actually bought our
2176760	2182040	game. So I was able to actually play that a little bit. And a friend of our JD was with me,
2182040	2186040	and he had played because Killer Queens on the switch. So he'd played it and he was able to
2186040	2190200	explain it up so I could get the gist of what was going on. So that was fun. If you haven't played,
2190200	2195160	that's like a five on five game in the arcade. And there's like multiple ways to win. And it's just
2195160	2199960	it's just chaos, but it's fun, because it's so chaotic. So that was that was that, of course, I,
2199960	2205560	I may have allegedly had a few vodka diets at that point. So I was already feeling a little like,
2206040	2212760	video games. So yeah, I had a good time. So I bonds double six says yeah, Killer Queen needs
2212760	2217400	a five versus five to really enjoy it. We didn't have that. But we had like three on three. So it
2217400	2221800	kind of worked. It was fun enough, especially considering somebody else bought the games,
2221800	2229000	which was really kind. All right, uh, we will still be here with the show next week. Except
2229000	2234680	Loki will not be here next week. But Dark Sakura will be back. So and Loki talked about all that
2234680	2241160	last week. But yeah, he hasn't taken all the time off for all the fun reasons. Yes. So it's a
2241160	2248600	medical related thing. But it's it's a normal procedure. You'll be fine. But yeah, so we look
2248600	2254680	forward to welcoming you back in a couple weeks. So yep. All right. Let's move on and get into this
2254680	2259320	week's news. Probably a little less of it this week, just because I don't know if it's with
2259320	2263720	Easter and other holidays going on. It's slower, but I feel like there's less going on this week.
2263720	2270520	We'll talk about what's happening, including the latest in this this this story's just keeps on
2270520	2275000	this. This is turning into R Kelly's trapped in the closet. And I'm sorry, as I know,
2275000	2281640	he's a very problematic individual. But many people are very familiar with his opera. What is
2281640	2288680	it 2025 parts trapped in a closet. And I feel like the Activision Blizzard case is becoming
2288680	2292760	trapped in the closet. Loki, what happened this week?
2293400	2297080	It's like trapped in a drive thru, you know? Wow.
2299400	2308520	So apparently, there's accusations now that California is Governor Gavin Newsom has been
2308520	2318600	interfering with the ongoing DFEH investigation of Activision Blizzard. Apparently, he had fired
2318600	2326600	the top prosecutor for the case, or I should say the what was it the chief counsel was fired
2326600	2333640	by him. And then the assistant chief counsel had resigned in protest. They had alleged that he had
2333640	2339080	been his office had been repeatedly demanding advanced notice of litigation strategy and of
2339080	2348520	next steps in the litigation as if someone's feeding them the information. Also that they
2348520	2358520	started. Apparently, there's interference that the Newsom's office also said mimicked the interests
2358520	2368360	of Activision's counsel, protect, they tried to protect the agency's independence. So it's not
2368360	2373720	not a good allegation. That's for sure. I'm not really sure how much evidence there is in this.
2373720	2379720	But like, if it is true, then that's horrible. But you know, rich people tend to rub each other's
2379720	2387640	backs, you know, so if he's, you know, tied in with Bobby Kotick in any way, you know,
2387640	2393400	maybe, maybe that's why he's trying to make it go away, or I don't know, I don't know what they're
2393400	2401720	doing necessarily. But apparently, that there's, I guess, the office, of course, is claiming that
2401720	2408280	none of this is true. So maybe there'll be some sort of investigation into the investigation.
2409480	2414280	Which will just make everything take longer. That's interesting that that's the conclusion
2414280	2419720	people are arriving at is that maybe he's trying to stop the governor is trying to
2419720	2423560	lessen the investigation because there was I thought when I first heard this, it was the
2423560	2431320	other way around, that he was wanting to make sure that it was more aggressive, that he could then be
2431320	2437160	seen as a champion in his state for these sorts of, you know, the unions in the gaming industry,
2437160	2441000	find it. I don't know, it's interesting that there's two ways to look at it, right? Because
2441000	2447720	I thought it was the other way about it, like, honestly, because like, you know, for me, given
2447720	2454280	the opportunity for a politician to do something, you know, if it's like, such and such politician
2454280	2459720	was found to have, I'm going to assume that's going to be negative, because it's typically
2459800	2467320	always negative. You know, we always hear about like, insider trading, or spending taxpayer money
2467320	2474840	on nonsense, or, you know, well, my, my mind also goes to that, you know, the people that
2474840	2479320	district attorney or whoever that magically resigned in the New York case about the Trump
2479320	2483480	prosecution, and I know we're getting away from video games, but I'm trying to show you the common
2483480	2488840	denominator here is that, you know, I kind of thought, because you know, that all and it looks
2488840	2495240	like now that case is fizzling out, because of that all happening, that maybe that got Newsome's
2495240	2500280	attention wanting to make sure the same thing doesn't happen here in California, and was maybe
2500280	2503960	worried it was going down that road. That's just what I drew out of it. I mean, and again, we don't
2503960	2508440	know, it could it could very well be what you're saying as well, Loki, which would be disgusting.
2508440	2514280	And I'd be very, very upset with how much I've supported Newsome over the years to find out if
2514280	2521000	that was the case. Yeah, I don't know which way it is, but I don't like meddling either way.
2521000	2528280	I mean, just let it happen. Let let the, you know, look at the departments that are, you know,
2528280	2533800	meant to do this stuff. Take it do their jobs like you don't need to interfere with it.
2534360	2539080	As 200 mountain chat says there are some groups within the investors asking others to vote against
2539080	2546280	the Microsoft acquisition because Kotick is getting a payout. Fair. Fair concern. Absolutely.
2546280	2554280	I understand. So yeah, we'll have to see what develops. But I mean, hopefully this I mean,
2554280	2561720	it's going to slow the whole process down. But hopefully not too much. It's just interesting
2561720	2565800	that now it just involves the governor of all things on top of everything else. I mean, what
2566200	2571000	now when does the White House get involved? Because I feel like that's where it's going next.
2571000	2579560	It's just layers upon layers. Anyhow, in quite a bit less serious news, but back into the video
2579560	2585160	game world and things I think I'm kind of looking forward to Capcom arcade stadium is getting a
2585160	2591160	sequel. So there's going to be Capcom arcade second stadium. Now we'd already had hints that
2591160	2595320	this was happening because of like, I think it was a Korean ratings board leak or one of the rating
2595320	2601320	boards internationally leaked it. But it was confirmed by Capcom this week. 32 more classic
2601320	2608280	titles will be coming to the second Capcom arcade stadium. It has also confirmed this lineup will be
2608280	2615640	on switch PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC. And the free game in the list will be son son or son
2615640	2621640	son is the free game that's in the list. It's it's kind of a deep cut. I don't think it's a game
2621640	2626280	you're going to recognize right off the bat. But if you've played other Capcom collections over the
2626280	2636360	years, you might recognize the game. So and it's it's it's free. So check it out. So yeah, three
2636360	2643320	wonders is also getting a is also going to be a bonus in the Capcom fighting collection that was
2643320	2649480	confirmed in the same tweet by Capcom of Europe. So they're kind of, you know, teasing in advance
2649480	2654920	these upcoming releases. We don't know what else is going to be in the Capcom arcade stadium second
2654920	2660040	stadium yet. I would imagine maybe we'll find out a little more games calm seems to be a good time
2660040	2667000	to figure this out. Yes, so we'll see. Oh, good point. sj 100. Matt, I forgot about that. son son
2667000	2674520	is in MVC too. I forgot that that is a like a character in that. So awesome. Dr. Julia says the
2674520	2679960	second they confirm Black Tiger I'm putting down my pre order and that son son was in Capcom
2679960	2685320	collections one on PlayStation two. It wasn't it they had a big collection on PlayStation three as
2685320	2692520	well wasn't it in that? I don't know cap cap calm like Sega, like other companies tends to revisit
2692520	2696600	the retro catalog frequently but not that I mind Capcom's got a lot of great shit in the retro
2696600	2701400	catalog. The first arcade stadium was pretty cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what they put
2701400	2706680	together in the second. I'm a little surprised they didn't just expand the first stadium with
2706680	2712600	the additional titles. But I understand that maybe they need some different stuff in it to make it
2712600	2720280	work and all that. So wow, I didn't. Tada. I didn't you know what I just learned? If someone follows
2720280	2725000	my personal channel, the alert will still come through even though I'm broadcasting on fog.
2726200	2729880	So somebody must have just followed my personal channel. Well, thank you, whoever that was.
2731400	2739000	That's funny. All right. Anyhow, let's move on Loki. I talked about this earlier.
2740120	2748200	Yeah, so no man's sky got another update. So the outlaws update, which adds space pirates and
2748200	2756120	lots of other stuff. I know they had like solar sails and, you know, cool little expansions,
2756120	2762840	I think to your base and stuff. But some folks are complaining that maybe it's not exactly
2762840	2769240	as polished as they had hoped. There's apparently been instances where too many
2769240	2775240	pirates are attacking players. There's one person that was mentioning that they got
2775240	2783720	attacked by pirates six times in the course of 10 minutes. So maybe they need to dial that down a bit.
2784600	2788360	Well, I have some good news for you. They in the experimental build on steam,
2788360	2792840	which is kind of like their test, they have acknowledged that the pirates are spanning,
2792840	2797160	spawning too often. So they've toned that down. And the pirates no longer spawn in low
2797160	2801400	galaxy, low conflict galaxies, and they don't spawn while you're like underground. So they
2801400	2806680	have tried to cut it back a little bit. That's good. And then they've revamped the aerial combat.
2806760	2814520	Aerial combat. They have done a bunch of other updates as well. So
2816360	2819320	yeah, I mean, it looked really cool. I really need to go back and play it.
2819960	2825560	I think I downloaded it the other day in hopes to like play it at some point on this new PC. I know
2825560	2830680	it looked really pretty when I was watching you play it. And then of course, you know, everybody's
2830680	2834680	saying, well, you know, no man's sky is pretty awesome and stuff. But what's next for Hello
2834680	2842920	Games? And of course, Sean Murray is talking about his next project, which he says is pretty
2842920	2848920	ambitious. Similar to no man's sky. It's kind of a project that even if we had 1000 people working
2848920	2856520	on it, it seemed impossible. Stop hyping it up, dude. Stop didn't Kotaku write an article that
2856520	2862680	was basically Hey, Sean Murray, shut up, like shut up, like, that is a stop talking on Murray
2862680	2870680	from hyping up no man's sky successor. Yes, that he needs to learn the lesson like, you know,
2871640	2878680	tempered the expectations. I agree. I agree. But gamers also need to learn the lesson
2878680	2885640	to stop buying into so much fucking hype. At least, you know, Lacey has like some credit,
2885640	2891880	obviously, because you know, no man's sky is a great game that's constantly getting updates.
2891880	2898600	Oh, yeah, I'll be buying this new game, whatever, whatever it is. And I realized I could be opening
2898600	2904840	myself up for trouble. Whatever this game is, I will be buying it day one. Because of how much I
2904840	2911960	love no man's sky and what it's become now. The thing is, I was just like, he needs to give it
2911960	2918120	time. He needs to not rush it out. You know, I thankfully, hopefully that they can publish it
2918120	2922280	independently, not necessarily like being published by Sony or something like that.
2922280	2926040	So I think that may have had a little bit to do with, you know, pushing that out earlier than
2926040	2932600	it needed to be. But I'm hoping that he'll take his time released when it's ready. That type of
2932600	2938120	stuff. But I'm excited to see whatever he's working on next. Yeah, perhaps not the game
2938120	2943560	awards this year. Yeah, with my luck, the game will be man a sports or something at this point,
2943640	2946120	after I just said I'm buying it no matter what.
2950520	2957000	But I love no man's sky so much now. And it's so well supported. I can't imagine I won't buy
2957000	2962840	whatever they say is coming up next, whether that's no man's sky to I would be so into like
2962840	2968200	an adventure game. That's extremely open world type of thing like using the same procedural
2968200	2971880	generation. I think it will be procedural generation of some sort. But I don't think
2971880	2977000	it'll necessarily be space again. But it could be procedural generation on a planet,
2977000	2981640	like one world that you're exploring, like an entire world to question or something I could
2981640	2986520	be really exciting. I don't know. We'll see. I don't want to hype it up either. Like honestly,
2986520	2990920	I don't want to hype it up either or set my expectations. I look forward to whatever it is.
2990920	2996120	And honestly, I bought the last campfire, which I mean, Hello Games just published,
2996120	3001080	they didn't really have much to do with it otherwise. And it was cute. And I enjoyed it.
3001640	3007480	I even bought that just because I had Hello Games name on it. So and I wasn't disappointed. But I
3007480	3015160	also didn't, you know, drink the Kool Aid too much. You know, I'm not going to complain because
3015160	3022680	you all are following my personal channel. So keep it up. Honestly. This is the wild thing is,
3022680	3029960	here's the weird thing. It's not on that that whole like thing is not on this current scene.
3029960	3035640	So I don't know how that audio is leaking through. Because it shouldn't be anyway,
3035640	3039640	I need to go back and take lessons on how to broadcast apparently,
3040600	3044360	mute the audio source and OBS. It shouldn't even be a thing.
3047240	3054120	That's just weird. I'll have to figure it out later. Anyway, yeah. Um, I guess I'd have to.
3054120	3062200	The problem is I'm live with OLR. I would have to switch to my thing and mute it there. I don't
3062200	3067400	know. Anyway, I'm not going to worry about it. If we get random Windows 95 sounds playing during
3067400	3072360	the stream tonight. You know what? Worst things have happened around here at OLR after 910
3072360	3078360	episodes. So I will not I will not mind the accentuation of my points with a tada. So by
3078360	3087400	all means follow Rob Roberts on Twitch. And while you're at it, Loki OLR on YouTube.
3088520	3092200	And I suppose the sharpest shout out for dark soccer even though she's not here tonight
3092200	3099480	on Twitch. All right, uh, let's see. Um, the no man's sky update. The other thing I wanted to say
3100120	3107720	I um, I do like the update but I agree the pirates are way too over tuned and I wish there was a way
3107720	3113160	to play more passively. I don't like that they got harder in space with the shields.
3114280	3119000	And I just wish there was a way when you warp into a new system and they're fighting the frigate.
3119000	3124520	I wish you could just ignore it. And like not keep getting harassed about it because you could
3124520	3130040	just fly past it but it'll keep bothering you until you go kill those pirates. So that's the
3130040	3135800	part that I really need the team to iron out is like if I want to play pacifist, let me play
3135800	3142040	pacifist. And I don't mean creative mode. I don't mind a little bit of danger when it comes to
3142040	3147240	surviving on the planet and things of that sort. I just don't necessarily and fighting pirates when I
3147240	3152200	want to. I just don't necessarily want to do it all the time. So that's that's my only kind of
3152200	3159000	complaint. But I feel like some of the stuff is a little more limited to the fact that I'm in the
3159000	3165880	seasonal mode right now, the current expedition. And so maybe it's a little over tuned because the
3165880	3172920	pirates are the theme of the expedition. So there is that. So all right, moving on. What do we have
3172920	3181480	next? Let's talk about the auto renewal of premium subs on the various consoles. So you might remember
3181480	3187000	this because Microsoft went through this a few weeks ago, where they started to change some of
3187000	3194120	their rules around auto renewal and automatically canceling some people's Xbox Gold if they don't
3194120	3200280	touch it for two years. Well, interestingly enough, Sony and Nintendo are starting to do
3200280	3206040	similar things. Sony as of this week will bug PlayStation plus subscribers ahead of time before
3206040	3211320	the renewal occurs and instruct a user on how to cancel their service and they will not charge
3211320	3216920	users who are not using it. Nintendo will automatically turn off auto renewal at the time
3216920	3223000	of purchase instead of the default toggle of on, which is the default. Why is this all happening?
3223800	3229880	It could possibly be credited to the UK competitions and markets authority or CMA,
3229880	3233800	because they have been looking at the big three of Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.
3234760	3240360	And Microsoft, of course, did their update in January. And now Sony and Nintendo are following
3240360	3246440	suit. The director of enforcement Michael Grenfell with the CMA said in a quote, today's
3246440	3252600	announcement therefore concludes our investigations into the online video gaming sector, companies and
3252600	3258440	other sectors, which offer subscriptions that auto renew should review their practices to ensure they
3258440	3263960	comply with consumer protection law. So that's interesting is that the CMA and the UK is
3263960	3267960	declaring victory they are playing the Final Fantasy victory fanfare because the big three
3267960	3273720	have all made changes to their rules. By the way, I think this is interesting,
3274440	3280520	because something that I noticed happening more and more on PlayStation plus is that if you use
3280520	3287160	the app, you get a push notification that says, hey, don't forget to claim your free games this
3287160	3291960	month. The month's almost up. Don't forget to claim your free games. And now that I'm reading
3291960	3298040	this, Sony will bug PlayStation plus subscribers ahead of time and instruct users on how to cancel
3298040	3304360	their service and will not charge users who are not using it. But if they're reminding you to
3304360	3314200	cash in your free games, you're using it, aren't you? So the CMA may have won a victory. But did
3314200	3319160	they win a victory? I don't know. I guess that's really in the eye of the consumer. You have the
3319800	3323880	right to cancel your games or cancel your subscriptions whenever you want.
3323880	3331160	But there are a lot of people who just kind of set it and forget it. So anyway, interesting that
3331160	3337000	all the big three have kind of done that. And some folks in chat are talking about, let's see,
3337000	3343000	Zen Monkey says today Microsoft gave me Game Pass for $1 and gave me a $10 credit for some reason,
3343000	3348200	fun times. And Bonds006 says, yeah, Microsoft gave me so many $10 credits over the years.
3348840	3353080	And I think you guys are probably reading that there's something similar going on there.
3353080	3359320	What is $10 to Microsoft if they get to keep your $60 Xbox Gold subscription,
3359320	3366600	or maybe even more for Game Pass for the next year? It's worth it to them. By the way,
3366600	3371080	stay tuned because I have something you can spend that $10 credit on. And we'll get into that a
3371080	3376040	little later in the show. There's something really cool coming up that I can't wait to talk about.
3376040	3381560	But for now, we'll move on to this story, which just it makes me giggle. I don't know what else
3381560	3388440	to say. Loki, go ahead. It's just it's, it's hardcore. Yes. So there are some hardcore fans
3388440	3395000	of Club Penguin out there. And of course, there were some folks that developed a quote unquote
3395000	3403320	fan game Club Penguin re written that was, I guess, operating since I don't know 2017 or
3403320	3407320	something like that. Like the year after they shut down Club Penguin, I think Yeah,
3407320	3412680	it was very shortly after they shut down. Well, apparently the three or three of the folks that
3412680	3419400	were responsible for it have been under investigation by the city police of London,
3419400	3426200	and I think Kevin arrested for copyright infringement, because they were apparently,
3427480	3431960	you know, violating copyright because they don't know the rights to Club Penguin. And in fact,
3431960	3437240	the game's web page now says the site has been taken over by the operation creative
3438120	3448360	police intellectual property crime unit. And I, I just can't believe I mean, I can't believe
3448360	3454280	but I can't believe with everything going on in this industry, Activision Blizzard,
3455000	3460600	and other companies out there. Someone finally got arrested over fucking Club Penguin.
3460840	3465160	It's because and I'll tell you why it's because they were making money off of it.
3465160	3470920	Because of course, running a game like this costs money. And it says therefore ads are
3470920	3475720	placed in certain parts of the game we or at least I assume that's how Disney got us.
3476920	3483320	As absolutely how Disney got you, you fool. Don't put ads in a game that is doesn't belong to you.
3485240	3487880	I mean, it was operating on thin ice as it was. I mean,
3488840	3493240	I mean, I know some companies like Sega have been really cool when they shut down an MMO.
3493240	3498520	They basically like came up with a way for people to download Phantasy Star Online blueburst data so
3498520	3505480	you could play it on pirate servers, but that's Sega not Disney. So I cannot believe we finally
3505480	3510440	have an arrest in the gaming industry and it's over fucking Club Penguin. And Bobby Kotick
3510440	3517000	walks free. Bobby Kotick he's come on now they are allowed to you know, perpetuate you know,
3517000	3522680	all sorts of sexual harassment at their workplace. But you make a fan club penguin
3522680	3527720	game and dare to charge and money or dare to get money from ads to run that game.
3528440	3532520	You're going straight to the slammer. That's how we get those pores.
3533480	3540040	Where are our priorities? All right. Anyhow, we need to go back to a simpler time when I don't
3540040	3544920	know if people were getting arrested over video games. It was because they were starting fights
3544920	3548280	at arcades. I don't know. Let's roll the bumper for this segment.
3558840	3564280	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
3564280	3569240	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
3570200	3575400	Haha, no, you won't because you're not here. But I'm here. And I will talk about this week's
3575400	3579880	classic game of the week, which is my pick. And perhaps you recognize it from the little
3579880	3584280	bit of video they're playing on Twitch. But for the rest of you and on the podcast feed,
3584280	3589480	the game we are looking at is civilization four is the classic game of the week this week
3589480	3597000	originally released for Microsoft Windows in North America, October 25 2005. And dark soccer
3597080	3603240	if you're out there, yes, there was a Mac release as well June 30 of 2006. So civilization four,
3603240	3608600	of course, is the fourth game in the civilization series. The designer behind the game was Soren
3608600	3613640	Johnson. And of course, Sid Meyer, whose name is really synonymous with a lot of the older
3613640	3619560	civilization titles as well as a lot of the great fair access and you know, 4k titles at the time.
3620280	3626200	Sid Meyer is the director of the game. It was, of course, followed by civilization five and six and
3626200	3631720	hopefully someday seven. Civilization four, of course, is one of the all time great 4x games.
3631720	3638760	That means you explore, expand, exploit, exterminate. That's what 4x means. So it's
3638760	3643880	to me, it feels a little bit like a board game. But like a really big one. And I know there
3643880	3649720	actually is a civilization board game. But this I'm just talking about like what I felt when I was
3649720	3653560	playing this game because I love civilization for I love the original civilization. But I've done
3653560	3658040	the original civilization as a classic game of the week a long time ago. But I thought, you know,
3658760	3663560	we had the Grammy Awards a couple weeks ago, and we had our second video game Grammy win.
3663560	3667080	Well, you know, where the first video game Grammy win came from, of course, was this game
3667080	3672120	civilization for and the soundtrack Baba Yetu, which was created by Christopher 10, which is
3672120	3678360	a song about the Lord's Prayer and Swahili. That was the original Grammy winning song that could
3678360	3684200	be credited to a video game. And that was from the intro to civilization for also kind of really
3684200	3688360	cool about this game that you may not have realized. Some of the quotes voice acting in the
3688360	3694680	game relating to technology and narration were Leonard Nimoy doing that so and obviously, we've
3694680	3699800	lost him since this game was released in 2005. So pretty awesome that we have something to remember
3699800	3706520	him by. And of course, we know that Baba Yetu is the big song from the game. But the soundtrack
3706520	3713560	also has other medieval Renaissance and Baroque origin music. The design for the title music was
3713560	3721320	influenced by the Lion King, which I can kind of see it. So it's pretty cool. So lots of mods that
3721320	3726920	go with this game, you can do earth Greek world, so forth. There's lots of lots of ways to mod this
3726920	3733880	game. There's many ways to win this game, you can do a combat victory, you can take over the world
3733880	3739800	with your units, you can win a science victory where you blast off into space and and fortify
3739800	3745560	space. I believe in this one, you could do other victories like was this the one that we started
3745560	3749480	cultural victories? Or did that come later? I can't remember if that was later in the series
3749480	3753240	or not. But there were multiple ways to win. And that was something kind of a little bit unique to
3753240	3762440	the Forex series as well. Um, let's see, also, this game was more open to customization than
3762440	3768360	the predecessors because the game data and the rules were in XML files. And a software development
3768360	3774520	kit or SDK was released in April 2006 to let you customize the game AI. So if you wanted to go back
3774520	3779400	to a world where Gandhi was a meanie, like he was the original civilization because of an error,
3779400	3784760	you could do that with the SDK. The map editor, you could use Python. So that's kind of fun that
3784760	3789560	you could do all sorts of editing with the game as well. How was the reception to the game?
3789560	3796600	One million units of this game sold by mid March of 2006. It was pretty regularly in the top 10
3796600	3803000	positions of computer game sales charts. It was the 11th best selling computer game of 2005.
3803880	3809800	It had a 94 on Metacritic if you care about that sort of things, getting praised for things like
3809800	3815000	advanced 3d computer graphics, difficult AI, and the multiplayer feature or feature as well.
3815560	3821320	Uh, IGN and their review mentioned that the game AI was way better than it was in Civilization 3.
3822440	3828840	And in my opinion, it was much better than Civilization 3. This is also interesting. In
3828840	3836600	August 2016, when Time put together their 50 best video games of all time list, Civilization 4
3836600	3842520	placed 11th. So it's really considered one of the best of all time. And one of my favorites,
3842520	3849640	and you might be wondering, why did I pick four? Why didn't I pick two or three? I pick for one,
3849640	3854280	the Grammy tie in is sort of that, but four really does remain one of my favorite Civ games.
3854280	3858600	It might, you know, I think the original always is going to hold a special place in my heart.
3858600	3863720	But I think four is really probably one of the best outside of the original. I think six is
3863720	3868680	really good too, as is five. I think three is the worst in my opinion. It's not bad. It's not a bad
3868680	3874040	game by any means. This is the worst Civilization game. Um, so there is that. So, uh, yeah, I like,
3874040	3880360	I like Civ 4, uh, to be honest, uh, going to chat. Darktot Studio says, I think I still have Civ 3
3880360	3885800	on Steam. I remember that was one of the physical games I ever owned. They gave away Civ 3 for dirt
3885800	3891080	cheap at some point. I'm sure you picked it up, uh, at some point. Zen Monkey says Civ 4 was the
3891080	3898040	last good one. If you're into the spy game, they fucked up in, uh, Civ 5 and Civ 6 and SSJ 100,
3898040	3903560	Matt, bringing up the infamous, just one more turn saying it was so easy to fall into a six
3903560	3910600	hour play session and not realize it as soon as Matt also asking, didn't Rob pick civilization
3910600	3916360	revolution as a game of the week? At one point, I don't know if I did did Civ rev specifically.
3916360	3921880	I know I've done the original civilization. I don't know if I did Civ rev. If I didn't, I should,
3921880	3926520	but I probably won't revisit the series again for a while because a, this is dark soccer segment.
3926520	3930920	She was a, she picks the game. It's only when she's not here that I do or, or Loki does. So,
3930920	3935400	um, it'll probably be a while before I get to Civ revolution, but I do love that game in the
3935400	3941960	series as well, because it was a throwback to the original. It was almost like the original game in
3941960	3949320	a more modern engine. And that's why I liked Civ rev and Civ rev came out after this, it was between
3949320	3954440	four and five. So in the timeline, it's pretty similar. Uh, the other big thing that came out
3954440	3960360	in the Civ four timeline was the colonization remake because Sid Meier also did a game called
3960360	3966120	colonization. Uh, and it ran, it had some big, big differences than the regular civilization.
3966120	3971960	Uh, and that had come out for PC, you know, back in the day, and then they redid it in Civ four's
3971960	3978200	engine, which was interesting. So, uh, yeah, lots of good stuff from civilization in this decade.
3978200	3983400	And again, quite honestly, I would love nothing more than to see this game, uh, get a seventh
3983400	3988760	entry in the series. We're due for it. This is the time to announce it. Civ six has gotten its
3988760	3995800	last expansion. And, um, I want to say it's been a good five or six years since Civ six at this
3995800	4002360	point, granted the pandemic. There is summer games Fest. There's, you know, lots of opportunity
4002360	4007160	to announce a Civ seven. I would be very happy about that. But again, with the pandemic affecting
4007160	4010840	development and something like that too, I also would not be surprised if maybe it's a next year
4010840	4017320	thing, because I would bet Civ seven is probably going to be eyed for release on consoles as well
4017320	4024680	as PC because Civ six was so, but anyway, we're talking about Civ four and Civ four was, uh,
4025320	4030600	not the case. They, they, the console's kind of got Civ Rev instead, but Civ Rev was great.
4030600	4036520	So there it is your classic game of the week civilization for one of the very best in the
4036520	4039320	series. One of my favorites and Loki, you've played a bit of that game too, right?
4039880	4045560	No. Oh, I thought you'd had, I own them, but I haven't played them. They're in my backlog.
4045560	4051560	You were able to buy like the entire thing, like Civ four and all of its DLC. You could buy for
4051560	4055160	like a dollar at one point or they gave it away in a humble bundle or something.
4055160	4061640	I think I did get it in a humble bundle. Um, or maybe I got a steam sale. I know I do have it.
4061640	4068200	I think I have four. I may have six. I can't remember.
4068200	4074120	Six is good too. Zen monkey says we probably won't get Civ seven for a long time. Civ six
4074120	4078680	has that endless update shit they're doing with the new front tear nonsense. They plan on making
4078680	4083800	it a 10 year game like GTA five. I have to admit I have fallen out of Civ six since it first came
4083800	4089320	out. It's nothing against the game. It's just that I don't have 12 hour weekend binges to spend
4089320	4093560	playing it anymore. And that's exactly what happens. Um, but you know, Civ is always going
4093560	4098920	to hold a special place in my heart at such a good series. So I think I just want Civ seven.
4098920	4103400	So I have an excuse to revisit it full well knowing that I'm going to lose an entire fucking
4103400	4108520	weekend of playing the game. Interesting. So I don't have six or four. I have three and five.
4109320	4113720	Five. Five's good. I like five. Five was the first one that did the hexagons. If I remember
4113720	4117240	right. It changed the shape of the board and I there's a lot about five. I really like.
4118120	4121880	So all right. There it is your classic game of the week.
4121880	4125160	Uh, just a few rapid fire stories for you tonight from Loki.
4126520	4134040	Yep. So, um, well, there's going to be some new games coming to Xbox that you might have
4134040	4141000	seen on other platforms. So bug snacks and Godfall are going to be coming to the Xbox,
4141320	4147720	series X and S, uh, later this month, Godfall a game that no one really wanted to play on
4147720	4153080	the PlayStation bucks next. So yeah, that that's pretty good. Um, bucks nice is going to be coming
4153080	4158040	out at the end of this month on April 28th and it will be part of game pass as well.
4158040	4162680	So you can check that out. And apparently it's also getting released on intend to switch as well
4162680	4170760	and getting a free expansion. Um, Godfall. I'm not sure when that's coming out necessarily,
4170760	4178360	but it is coming out at some point. That's cool. Um, I, uh, I guess it already came out.
4178360	4183240	That's what happened. It came out last week. Oh, and nobody seemed to notice. Um,
4183880	4190440	the exclusive windows must've run out for Sony on those, uh, clearly. So, uh, I wonder if Godfall
4190440	4195000	will get that free edition. I might, I'll check it out if it's free, but I'm not going to pay money
4195000	4199880	to check it out. They'd be smart to put Godfall on game pass. They probably get more curious though.
4199880	4205720	So, I mean, I don't know, uh, the PC exclusive because we know Sony's been dipping their toe
4205720	4210520	into the PC. So that exclusive window tends to be a little different than, um, Microsoft or whatever.
4212040	4217240	Yeah. Which is fun because now I don't have to, I will not that I can own a PlayStation five right
4217240	4222200	now if I wanted to, but like, like the best of both worlds, I can get almost all the games on PC.
4222200	4227320	Well, I'll still get a PS five, right? Right. At this point, I'm waiting for one of two things,
4227320	4235640	a final fantasy 16 release date, um, or, uh, the, uh, uh, a hardware refresh for the PS five.
4235640	4239560	I would say two years after the release of the console, which will be this holiday would be the
4239560	4244200	time to expect a hardware refresh, but I don't know because of the pandemic, because of the
4244200	4249400	supply issues, it may not happen. And I full well realize that, but I'm on, I'm saying that on one
4249400	4254120	hand, but then on the other hand, I'm like, but they're still pushing forward with this VR stuff.
4254120	4259240	So I feel like something's going to give in that department. So I'm, uh, I'm gonna,
4259240	4263960	I'm gonna see what the summer has in store for PlayStation, but I really, you know, I,
4263960	4269480	I will drop everything to play fall fantasy 16, a hundred percent. Are you kidding me? Uh,
4269480	4274360	creative business unit three who made 14 gets to make a single player final fantasy. I am
4274360	4280360	there. Like I will take days off work to play fall fantasy 16, which I didn't think I'd still
4280360	4285000	be doing in my forties, taking time off work to play video games, but I will do it for that game.
4287560	4289560	Not that the expectations are high or anything.
4291080	4296200	No, not at all, but 15 was kind of meh. So, I mean, can you really get any worse than that?
4296920	4297880	famous last words.
4300680	4306520	Yeah, I, I don't, I, I never finished 15. I got bored of it so fast.
4306520	4307880	I don't play a lot of people didn't.
4309160	4311160	Like, I just need to go back and play it.
4312520	4317320	Sure. What, anything else in rapid fire news?
4318600	4329000	Yeah. So then also we've got, um, there's a new, I guess, the arrival add on for doom and doom two
4329000	4334920	for the switch. It's, um, additional content for the switch version of the game that you can,
4335320	4342520	download, I guess, from in the game. And it's an 11 episode replacement pack that was created by,
4343880	4347640	Pavara. And it says features music by the doom community.
4349640	4357640	AD 79 is I guess the composer of that. That's pretty cool. And I guess it's not the only
4357640	4361160	add on that they've had for the switch version. So neat.
4361160	4368680	All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some games that'll be coming out soon
4368680	4377800	for you to play. Yep. Not a whole lot. So we've got, it looks like, um, Star Wars, the force
4377800	4387960	unleashed on Nintendo switch, uh, Chernobyl light, um, on PlayStation five and X-Box series,
4388920	4397400	Pocky and Rocky re-shined on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four teardown on PC. I guess that's
4397400	4405800	coming out of early access cause that's been out already. Um, Yomari or, uh, let me pronounce this,
4405800	4415640	uh, Yomawari on Intel switch and PlayStation four. And I believe that is it. All right.
4416440	4421880	Maybe you can do the UK dates here while I do the Japan ones here. Um, so going to Japan tonight,
4421880	4426840	uh, on the Nintendo switch coming out on April 21st, Pocky and Rocky re-shined also gets a
4426840	4430840	release on the switch. Um, but it is, it's, it's released in Japan, but it's still the English
4430840	4438440	version. Uh, also coming out, uh, e-baseball powerful pro yucky 2022. So for those of you
4438440	4444920	that want to play another Konami sports game, e-baseball, sending you my thoughts and prayers
4444920	4451080	that that is a wise investment. Uh, WRC 10 is also coming out, uh, in Japan this week on the
4451080	4457800	switch and world war Z gets a Japanese release, uh, on the switch this week as well. Uh, going
4457800	4465400	to the PlayStation five, um, hyper dimension, Neptunia sisters versus sisters, a sister special
4465400	4470440	limited edition, uh, is available as well as a regular edition that is out on the PlayStation
4470440	4475000	five this week. Uh, for those of you that, you know, want to play, uh, uh, some more,
4475000	4480280	uh, hyperdimensional Neptunia games, uh, that is really it on the PlayStation five
4480280	4485080	PlayStation four tends to have pretty similar releases to the switch. Uh,
4485080	4490120	Yomawari three is there as well. You hit that hyperdimensional Neptunia game on PlayStation
4490120	4497240	four as well. Uh, and, uh, Oh, I chemco RPG selection volume nine. My goodness. They keep
4497240	4503880	cranking these out. This one with as divine saga, ghost sink, sort of a plesia and ambition record.
4504760	4509240	They just keep cranking those chemco collections out. But, um, a lot of those games will otherwise
4509240	4514440	probably get lost to time just because I think very few of them were localized over here. That's
4514440	4522520	for sure. So there you go. Dark to see it does say about e-baseball. I hear the baseball game is okay.
4522520	4527880	It's e-football that's the dumpster fire. Well, can you see why I have concern?
4527880	4535160	Dark Tetsuya. I'm a little preemptively cautious. I'm skeptical of these claims.
4535160	4539000	Just saying no offense, my friend. Loki. How about Europe?
4539960	4547080	Uh, Europe has MotoGP 22 on PlayStation, X-Box and the switch. And they're also getting,
4547160	4554040	uh, Chernobyl light on PlayStation. That's it. Excellent. All right. We have some more stories.
4554040	4558920	We'll be inviting your calls in a little while though, over at vog network.com
4558920	4563320	slash discord. And we have at least one email tonight. So we do have some emails to get to.
4563320	4568120	So we'll have ourselves a listener round table in just a minute, but first some more news Loki.
4569160	4575320	Yes. So this is something that is near and dear to my kid's heart. And that is the
4575320	4581720	new Sonic the Hedgehog game in Roblox. That's right. So the new soccer Hedgehog game has been
4582520	4590120	published and it is in Roblox. It's Sonic speed simulator. And it's basically a 3d,
4590120	4597640	uh, Sonic game that you can play in Roblox. And this is in partner with of course, Sega.
4598200	4604280	And, uh, my kids have been just playing the crap out of this, but is it any good or is it kind of
4604280	4609320	garbage? It looks, it looks pretty, no, it doesn't look garbage actually. Cause you know, it's, it's,
4609320	4615000	it's put together by professional developers that, you know, make, you know, different games and
4615000	4619560	stuff, but it's not just made by kids or something like that. And there have been Sonic games that
4619560	4623480	of course been just made by kids and thrown in there and stuff, but no, this is actually
4623480	4631000	polished in, you know, uh, looks pretty good. And like I said, they've been playing that quite a
4631000	4635560	bit, which is pretty cool. I'm assuming this is also tying in with the brand new movie that came
4635560	4639880	out. Obviously I think that the timing is a little convenient for that. That's for sure.
4639880	4644680	Do you have to pay for that? Cause I you'll have to excuse me, but I have no idea how Roblox works.
4644680	4648600	Do you have to pay to play this? Or is it like a free ad on like sometimes they do in Minecraft,
4648600	4653160	like some free downloadable levels that have a little mini games? I think there's stuff that
4653160	4657400	you do have to pay for in the game. I don't remember if it's free. I know my son was saying
4657400	4665160	that he had the pay. He bought the game, but I think it was like, you probably buy stuff in the
4665160	4671640	game. Typically all the Roblox games are free and then you buy stuff in game to lock, like
4672840	4682200	game passes and, you know, skins and stuff like that. Hmm. Interesting. I would say I have to
4682200	4685960	check it out at some point, but let's be real. I'm not going to install Roblox to check it out. So
4687960	4691960	maybe Fortnite's the one I got talked into recently. Maybe they do a Sonic thing in
4691960	4694360	Fortnite. I'll check it out there, but I don't know about Roblox.
4695640	4700760	Yeah. I mean like, I don't know. It, it didn't look, it didn't look terrible. And there are
4700760	4705560	some games in Roblox that are actually very polished. I just never see my kids playing
4705560	4710200	those. They play usually like, doesn't Roblox kind of have a reputation for like a bunch of
4710200	4714680	like kids, your, your kid's age playing it like, does it, does a 43 year old man really need to
4714680	4720040	be on for Roblox? I feel like, I feel like I don't need to be there. You don't.
4723000	4728840	That's it. That's good. Yeah. But I would just, I would just want to turn multiplayer off and I
4728840	4733800	don't even think that's a thing you can do in Roblox. So you know, you can't unnecessarily,
4733800	4740200	but yeah, it's, it's, I mean, it looks pretty good, you know, like the video looks pretty
4740200	4745640	good of it. All right. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll watch, you know, on your son's inevitable YouTube
4745640	4749320	channel or something. I'll watch it when he's old enough. You know, funny enough, he actually put
4749320	4755880	out a video today. So my son does have a YouTube channel, but he doesn't. Yeah. He doesn't. He
4755880	4761960	deleted all of his videos and he started over cause he, he thought they were dumb. But yeah,
4761960	4766360	he's going to do that a lot as he gets older, as he gets closer and closer. He put out his,
4766360	4771640	like his introduction video and like he has some gameplay of like Roblox and stuff out there. So
4771640	4778200	yeah, he did do that. It's under our gaming. So I don't really have a link to his channel,
4778200	4783160	but like, yeah, he, he put out stuff, but yeah, he does Roblox videos occasionally. He'll make,
4783160	4786680	they used to do like, like little skits and stuff with their friends and stuff.
4786680	4791080	Wow. Like I said, they, he got embarrassed by it or something. And so he just, you know,
4791880	4797480	well, um, that's like, that's like when old tapes of my public access show from high school show up,
4797480	4800520	it can be a little embarrassing, the stuff I was doing at that age. So.
4801560	4805800	Yeah. Yeah. So like, I mean, I can link, I guess I could link it in our, our chat here,
4805800	4808840	but yeah, I'll, I'll do that. And then, um, you can check it out if you want,
4808840	4811320	but he only has one video up there, but yeah, it's fun.
4811960	4816680	Cool. Cool. All right. Uh, what else do you have? Loki? I think you have another story about, uh,
4816680	4825560	Kojima. Yes. Uh, so Kojima insists that, uh, Kojima productions is still independent,
4825560	4829960	even though they had posted something, I guess, on their social media with the PlayStation studios
4829960	4837880	banner. Um, so, you know, in the past, even though they have, um, partnered with Sony on different
4837880	4843160	things says, you know, he would post a tweet says, I'm sorry for misunderstanding, but Kojima
4843160	4848040	productions has been, and will continue to be an independent studio, even though, you know,
4848040	4853400	the PlayStation studios, um, logo, they're not sure why he tweeted that out. Why would you
4853400	4858440	read that out? That was, that was a silly little oversight, wouldn't it? Yeah. So.
4860600	4865240	I'm not really sure what that's all about, but, um, cause yeah, cause he tweeted it,
4865240	4871880	just the image with like nothing to go with it. So it's not like, Hey, congratulations. Or Hey,
4871880	4875800	Oh, I think he tweeted because he's got, you know, his game is featured in,
4876440	4884760	in that PlayStation studios, um, image because it's got a tiny little bit of Norman Reedus and
4884760	4891080	his fetus look corner there. Um, do you think, I don't know. I'm assuming that's why, do you
4891080	4894600	think we're going to see whatever Kojima is working on next this year, at least some type
4894600	4898520	of cryptic trailer that doesn't say a thing at summer game best, because, you know, it's been
4898520	4903000	a couple of years. Death Stranding came out right before the pandemic started because it was really
4903000	4907720	oddly like scary how much like the parallels were to the pandemic. I remember we talked at length
4907720	4913000	about that when that game first came out and okay, sure. Yeah. They had the, you know, remastered
4913000	4917400	redone edition for PlayStation five and PC that had like the slightly established be real the
4917400	4922040	entire team's resources were not dedicated to the death Stranding, you know, gold edition or
4922040	4926120	whatever it was called. So what's the team really been working on, you know, and of course,
4926760	4931720	insert your Silent Hill rumor here, but at least, at least for better or for worse,
4931720	4935240	we could find out what have the fuck they're working on. So at least the Silent Hill rumors
4935240	4940040	could stop if, if maybe they would announce whatever they're working on this summer.
4941000	4946360	Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I'd be curious. I think it will be a scary game though. I,
4946360	4951000	and you know, whether Silent Hill or not, I'm all for a Kojima scary game. I hope that they do,
4951000	4955800	you know, at some sort of announcement, I'm assuming something with Jeff Keeley
4955800	4960520	is going to be involved with. Yeah. That's why I specifically say summer game Fest, because I mean,
4961240	4966520	Kojima and, uh, uh, Jeff Keeley have quite the bromance going on, which is cool. I mean,
4966520	4972600	yeah, that's fine. So at least we, we know what to expect, although we should never
4972600	4979560	set our expectations too high, I guess. Right. Uh, yes. One thing I'm going to set my expectations
4979560	4986040	at a reasonable level for is the latest Niantic game, which was unveiled this week. Um, you know,
4986040	4990200	uh, Niantic hasn't had a new game in a while. We've heard of other projects that they're
4990200	4996440	involved with like the transformers game. Um, but otherwise Niantic has Pokemon go. Of course,
4996440	5002440	Ingress is still going and Pikmin bloom is still going as well. Uh, but now there's going to be
5002440	5007640	another Niantic game and this does seem to unlike the transformers thing, which I think is more
5007640	5014040	Niantic's wayfarer network in somebody else's game. Um, this is going to be a Niantic original
5014040	5019240	because it is a Niantic original IP, which is also interesting because that means this is Niantic's
5019240	5025640	first fully original game since Ingress, the first one, which many people still don't even know about
5026200	5031000	because they're playing Pokemon go or Pikmin. The game was announced this week and it's called
5031000	5038360	Niantic Peridot. Uh, I assume it's like the gem and not Peridot. I guess it could be either way.
5038360	5044440	Uh, but for now I'm going to say Peridot. Uh, so, uh, Peridot is breeding and caring for
5044440	5053320	virtual pets. And immediately my brain is like, yo, Niantic, it is going to be so easy for the
5053320	5058600	lazy journalists and tweeters out there of which there are a lot of them to just say, oh, this is
5058600	5066840	Pokemon go because Pokemon go is virtual pets. So this is Pokemon go. So Niantic right off the bat
5066840	5072040	by deciding to go this direction for their next game is going to have to do that uphill battle
5072040	5078440	of making sure it is obvious how this game is different from the outset, because I guarantee it,
5078440	5085960	I'm calling it now before a single review of this game comes out, every single one of them will
5085960	5092520	compare it to Pokemon go. Even if the game has nothing to do with it outside of the, um,
5092520	5097000	Poke stops and the literal places where, where points of interest are located.
5098040	5103640	The setup for the game is that the dots. So maybe it is Peridot. I look at it and think like a
5103640	5108280	Peridot, but maybe it is Peridot because they're called dots for short. Uh, they've been asleep for
5108280	5115320	thousands of years and, uh, you feed, play and explore with your dot to raise them to adulthood.
5115960	5119960	When you're out on walks, your dot might find hidden treasures. That sounds a little bit like
5119960	5125080	Pikmin. Uh, you can diversify the species of your dots by working with other players.
5126040	5129320	It sounds a little more like Tamagotchi or something. I think is what a lot of people
5129320	5133800	are kind of calling it right now. I was definitely getting that kind of vibe. Yeah.
5134920	5141400	So, um, but again, I think there's a lot in Pokemon that looks like, especially with the
5141400	5147960	buddy system that looks like Tamagotchi. So, you know, they gotta be careful. So, uh, Peridot is
5147960	5151800	said to be, and I guess it is Peridot that an orange eye in chat is telling me it is Peridot
5151800	5158360	and not like the gem. So fair enough. Um, Peridot is in a soft launch period and it's only going to
5158360	5163720	be in select markets at first Niantic almost always tests this stuff in Australia, New Zealand
5163720	5168120	first. So if you're in Australia, New Zealand, I would bet dimes to dollars. You'll get to play
5168120	5173240	this before anyone else. And sometimes they pick other regions as well. Um, I think Canada had one
5173240	5179720	of them early, so it just, it just depends, but the U S won't be one of them. So there's that,
5179720	5185160	uh, you can sign up at the official website. If you want play peridot.com, uh, if you want to sign
5185160	5188920	up and there's a cute little trailer, you can watch as well, where you certainly start to see
5188920	5193800	a lot more of Niantic's AR things and what they want to develop with that. But again, it's a
5193800	5199320	little early for me. I play all of Niantic's bullshit, all of it for better or for worse.
5199320	5203880	I've played Ingress way too long. I was playing it today. In fact, cause there was a big event
5203880	5209160	this weekend. So I played that to get my badge. Pokemon go. I still play here and there. Pikmin
5209160	5215080	bloom. I'm just shy of level 54 in Pikmin bloom. I didn't even know it could go. Apparently it goes
5215080	5220120	up to a hundred. Uh, so there's still a long way to go and Pikmin bloom. Uh, I played the Harry
5220120	5227160	Potter game for a hot minute until, um, that woman kind of ruined everything Harry Potter for me.
5227160	5231080	Um, but the, and the game was a little bit reductive with Pokemon go. So it was kind of,
5231080	5236200	you know, it kind of, it kind of got old faster and obviously it's gone now, but I did try it.
5236200	5240280	And, you know, I've tried derivatives, even if they're not Niantic games, I've tried things like
5240280	5246120	Orna, which is, you know, different, but still, you know, AR in a way. So, uh, yeah, so there's,
5246840	5251000	I try them all. It's just, I'm a sucker for those mobile AR games and using the real world as a,
5251000	5255880	as a game board is very interesting to me. So I wish the Catan thing had happened. I'd still
5255880	5260200	like to know what the fuck happened there. Yeah. I like Catan. I would have played that.
5260200	5263720	Yeah. Well, and people did play Catan in Australia, New Zealand,
5263720	5269720	cause it never came out of the testing phase after that. So it's weird. Anyway, we'll see
5269720	5273880	more information. I, you know, the minute it does come out in some region, it'll be all over Reddit.
5273880	5278840	So stay tuned. Anyhow, in the meantime, we're going to get to listener round table,
5278840	5284520	your chat questions, your discord calls at vog network.com slash discord and your emails
5284520	5290200	of which we have one to get to tonight. So let me get to it. I just need to bring it up here.
5293320	5299800	Sorry. I was not prepared because usually there's a third person here to help with some of this.
5299800	5304520	Um, do you have a last minute story for us maybe to help?
5304520	5310680	I've been looking for a last minute story. So there's just not a lot this week. So slow weeks.
5310680	5314200	Okay. Yeah. I don't have a last minute story. That's all right. We bought enough time talking
5314200	5318200	about, we need time. Uh, we have our, for our one and only email tonight. Participate
5318200	5321560	at orange launch radio.com is the place for you to send an email for a future week.
5322120	5329480	Tonight's email from Y Y R. Hello all are in lieu of this week's scheduled tangents and drag race
5329480	5334200	talk. I've decided to send an email to everyone disappointed at this turn of events. I'm truly
5334200	5338120	sorry. That's okay. I'm not even watching really the season of drag race, just following it on
5338120	5344360	social media. Last week's show led off with mention of Zoltar. While I must admit, I most definitely
5344360	5349160	see one of these coin operated Zoltar fortune time machines. I will also take this opportunity
5349160	5354200	to plug an entirely different Zoltar. He is one of my favorite DJs, spinning trance, vocal trance,
5354200	5359560	and associated energy pick packed music. He actually has a weekly podcast subterranean that
5359560	5364120	he has been running for quite a number of years now. And if all goes right, he should be hitting
5364120	5370120	episode a thousand later this year. Hey, that's a long time. If this sounds good to you and you're
5370120	5376120	caught up on OLR, do a search for a mix cloud Zoltar. That's Z O L T A R. I love that he
5376120	5381000	spelled it out in the email and you will find gobs of two hour sets waiting for you. Enjoy. Thank you.
5381000	5387880	Forza Horizon 5 came up in conversation, specifically a conversation about DLC. Yes,
5387880	5392760	Forza Horizon 5 does already have plenty of DLC. And ultimately it looks like it will have the same
5392760	5398520	DLC that Forza Horizon 4 did. There is already a car pass. Folks who purchased it are getting 34
5398520	5403960	new cars, one each week that are exclusive to owners of the DLC. It costs $30 if purchased
5403960	5408920	alone, but most of the cars will be available separately. There will also be two game expansions
5408920	5414520	released likely over the next 18 months for $20 each. Yes, it's following the similar formula
5414520	5419480	of the last games. There is VIP membership, which doubles the in-game credits earned,
5419480	5425160	gives you two free super wheel spins per week and a few exclusive items which cost $20 by itself.
5425160	5430600	But you can get all of the above for $50 or $45 if you have game pass, which makes it an easier
5430600	5435480	pill to swallow. That's probably the Bobby Black Wolf edition. I'm guessing that he bought because
5435480	5439800	I know he spent extra money on the game. And I'm going to assume that is like all the types of
5440520	5446680	loot that you get when you buy the game, even if you already have game pass.
5448600	5450920	And then of course, yes, you can buy the treasure map for $3,
5451720	5456360	which reveals the locations of all the hidden bonus boards, barn finds and other secret locations.
5456360	5461080	So all in all, the game has a lot of DLC for sure. But if you play the game as much as I do,
5461080	5466440	which is to say for hundreds of hours, then it feels worth it. And one reason fans of the game
5466440	5470520	don't seem to have much of a problem with this setup is because the in-game currency cannot be
5470520	5475480	purchased. And the game typically throws cars at you like a pitcher throws baseballs. In other
5475480	5481000	words, it feels like the DLC gives you something extra on top of your full game, rather than giving
5481000	5485880	you something that should have been in the game to begin with. I agree with that point. And that's
5485960	5490440	maybe what makes the DLC feel a little more invisible, I suppose.
5491640	5499080	Bobby Blackwolf wants to clarify, I have the $100 version, which is like the $45 pass. But I also
5499080	5504760	own the game if I ever cancel game pass, which I don't see Bobby Blackwolf doing that for a long
5504760	5509640	time. But before Forza Horizon 6 is out, but we'll see. We'll see. You never know, right?
5509640	5516280	So anyhow, more good stuff in this email from YYR. And then there was talk of Intellivision
5516280	5526440	Amico. Sigh. Cosigned on that sentence. Sigh. Honestly, my theory on it is that even if COVID
5526440	5530600	hadn't happened, it would still be exactly where it is now, but with different excuses.
5531320	5535720	My reasoning is that if you look at the Gamescom trailer that was shown back in August 2019,
5535720	5539720	and compare its short gameplay clips with all the videos released last year and this year,
5539720	5543400	you'll see the same games in the same state, meaning virtually nothing has been done with
5543400	5548280	them since then. It's a known fact that these games were all made in Unity, so it's not like
5548280	5552760	the hardware needed to be final and in production before more work can be done on them. And the deep
5552760	5557480	dive videos released last year were just awful, serving little purpose aside from showing how
5557480	5561560	shallow the games were in their current state. It's truly a shame because I was part of the
5561560	5565960	target market for this thing, and I even wanted to develop games for it. But it has clearly been
5565960	5570520	mishandled at every possible level, and if they think they can now turn around, finish it, and
5570520	5576280	then release it at the same price point as Nintendo Switch, they are plain old nuts. I don't think I
5576280	5586440	have a lot to add to what YYR is saying there. Whatever the reason is, whether it's that they
5586440	5591640	got screwed by the part people overseas or whatever, it's in a bad place right now,
5591640	5596920	and it doesn't look good. So, I mean, I will hope that they turn it around, but at the same time,
5596920	5601960	I will still buy the console myself because it's going to be one of those, it's so bad,
5601960	5604920	it's good things. It's going to be like the CDI of this decade. Watch.
5607240	5614200	BobbyBlackWolf also clarifying, five can be taken off Game Pass. Remember that Forza Horizon 4 is
5614200	5621880	off of Game Pass now. Fair point. And Bobby does say, we'll never know if they would have failed
5621880	5627400	the same way if there was no pandemic, and that's fair too. Now, here's the other interesting part
5627400	5631960	of YYR's email, and he saves this for the last paragraph, and I kind of think this is really
5632760	5636680	backloading your email. You didn't front load your email, you backloaded your email.
5636680	5640600	He should have said this at the start, in my opinion, but I will pay this paragraph
5640600	5645880	special attention. I would mention that I just released a game on Xbox,
5646440	5652040	but I've already rambled for too long. So, I'll just say you should go to YYR Games if you want
5652040	5656280	to see what I've been up to. YYRgames.com, excuse me, if you want to see what I've been up to.
5656280	5662520	Thanks again for the show, and have a great week. Always talking too much, Aaron. YYR.
5663560	5667560	So, don't you love that, that YYR just sneaked in the news, hey, I stealth relief the game on
5667560	5675960	Xbox this week, enjoy. Well, YYR, guess what? I actually looked at the emails ahead of the show
5675960	5685640	this week, and I have my trusty Xbox Series X controller right here. So, let me push the button,
5686440	5692760	and I apologize I don't have the right shots loaded, but since I have my personal stream
5692760	5698920	shots available, at least for the Twitch folks, I can show you what's on my Xbox right now.
5699560	5708200	And you'll notice that for the low, low price of $2.99, I picked up a copy of Falling Plus,
5709000	5716040	which is available now on Xbox Series X, and I believe it's available on PC as well.
5716760	5721720	And you'll notice it's a YYR game. Of course, this is the one that's inspired by
5722440	5730120	classic, it's got the pengo thing going on there, and it looks like a classic 80s game, basically.
5730920	5735720	And it has the Xbox Live leaderboards. There's one person on the main leaderboard right now,
5735720	5741320	so more of you need to pick this game up. I played before the show, but I had to quit because
5741320	5746120	the show was about to start and I wasn't dying, so I did not make the leaderboard myself.
5746120	5751080	But yeah, there it is, Falling Plus is on Xbox. And I assume, and Aaron's talked about this before
5751080	5759720	on the show, this must be through that new XNA kind of reborn thing he was getting into,
5759720	5765240	because one thing I did notice was that like the XNA games, there are no achievements with this
5765240	5770600	game, which is fine. But if you are an achievement whore, you're not going to find them. But I also
5770600	5777960	want to remind you, the game is $2.99. So it's still a great value. You'll notice there's still
5777960	5782920	lots of extras in here, including Arcade Mode, Survival Challenge, the Burning Igloo Challenge,
5782920	5791480	and so on and so on. So anyhow, there you go, Aaron, I got you by actually reading the emails
5791480	5797160	before the show tonight. And there it is, Falling Plus is now available on Xbox. I believe it is on
5797240	5804760	the PC, Microsoft Marketplace as well. Somebody may need to follow up with me to confirm that,
5804760	5812040	because I only looked on my Xbox Series X, but I think it's there. ZenMonkey11 in chat says,
5812040	5817400	I'm going to use my Xbox to get this. Now you all know why I said earlier, if you have $10 sitting
5817400	5822200	in your account, I know something you can spend some of that money on that would be very worthy
5822200	5827480	for a long time OLR supporter here. And sg100matt says, this is one of my favorite YYR games.
5828200	5832360	Now, I think it's a great game. I love all of Aaron's stuff. And I hope this is a really
5832360	5837320	good sign for his other stuff, getting some exposure on Xbox. I will also ask you one thing
5837320	5840840	I should point out. We have extra time tonight, whatever. I do see somebody in the green room,
5840840	5848200	and I apologize to that person. I will get to you shortly. But one thing I do want to point out
5848200	5854360	that was pretty cool about this is that if I actually go to the store on the Xbox Marketplace,
5854360	5862920	and I actually search, and I search for, crap, I have to turn off my, I can't see around my giant
5862920	5871800	head. Hold on. There we go. If I actually search for falling, not fall out, and not fall, so you
5871880	5878680	have to actually go into like falling space plus, but there it is, it is in the store.
5878680	5885720	So the nice thing is, I remember when this was on Xbox 360, when this game was originally out,
5885720	5891560	you had to go into like that separate store, that separate XNA store to find it. But you don't have
5891560	5898280	to do that here. It's actually here available just within the storefront. And it's actually,
5898280	5904440	it's also been rated E for everyone. Isn't that cute? So that's pretty cool. I love that it
5904440	5912840	actually has the full storefront available. It is presented in 4K Ultra HD with its retro graphics,
5912840	5917800	but congrats to YYR. That's amazing. Those pixels are extra sharp.
5917800	5923000	Those pictures are extra sharp, but I think that's really exciting. I'm really excited and happy for
5923000	5929560	YYR with that. So there you go. Bobby Blackwell says, going down to my theater. So look at that.
5929560	5933880	Thank you, YYR. Thank you. I will take my check next week on the show. No, just kidding. I'm
5933880	5940840	kidding. I do that because he's a friend of mine and I want to support his stuff. He has made OLR
5940840	5948440	dream games come true. I will always owe him for that. So, all right. Thank you, YYR. Now, Loki,
5948440	5956040	the next question is Pixel Poops number two on Xbox Win. Oh gosh, that'd be like,
5956680	5962840	that'd have to be a whole nother game. I don't think I can port an NES game to the Xbox.
5962840	5965800	I'm sure you could do it with emulators. You don't think someone's done like an S-Maker shell
5965800	5971800	for Xbox type of thing? No, I don't think for a shell per se, but they've done like emulators,
5971800	5977400	but that's kind of like a gray area. Like they don't want emulators on there. So like you'd
5977400	5983160	have to rewrite the whole thing, which honestly I'd probably be easier anyways. It's like getting
5983160	5987960	it to run just the way you'd want it. But yeah, it'd have to be a whole different thing.
5987960	5992360	SSU 100 Matt, thank you for getting the clip there. And please, please text that to Aaron.
5993160	5998520	So that he can see it before he listens to the show. All right. Uh, we have somebody who's been
5998520	6003160	very patiently waiting in the green room to come on the show. So let's get to the call. Hi, you're
6003160	6008600	on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, Hey, Hey, what's going on, everybody? Hey, Rama,
6008600	6013960	how you doing? It's good to see you. I'm good. I'm just glad I got my computer back up and running
6013960	6018440	before I was able before, you know, I was able to jump in and chill out in the green room again for
6018440	6023640	a few minutes. It's it's very good to see you here tonight. And yeah, I'm glad I'm glad you're able
6023640	6029640	to get everything worked out there in the green room. So because right before, you know, you
6029640	6035880	pulled me in. I actually knocked power to my entire apartment. Whoops. Oh, no, don't do that.
6037480	6041960	Yeah, I had the heater going because it got a little cold. I turned on the microwave to fix
6041960	6050200	my dinner. And then I'm just like, the lights when I was just like, Oh, oh, oh, all right.
6050200	6055960	What's on your mind tonight, my friend? Talk about how awesome game passes real talk. Now,
6056680	6062600	I have gotten pushback from people about, you know, PlayStation Game Pass and
6063720	6070840	Microsoft Game Pass. Now, all that aside, I look at it this way. For the top tier,
6071880	6079400	you get access to all these classic PlayStation one, PlayStation two games that you can download
6079400	6087000	and play or stream. Even if you already own the game on your PS one and your PS two,
6087960	6094120	you still have to pay this extra to download that version and start your game from scratch.
6094760	6101080	Whereas, you know, Microsoft's like, Oh, you have this game. Let's get you to updated version.
6101080	6108600	We good. We got you. Now, one thing I love about game passes, I can just download all these games
6108680	6117000	and just play them and see if I like them or not. And you get these great discounts on the games as
6117000	6123400	well. And you know, when you turn on your Xbox, you're like, Oh, check out these cool games. And
6123400	6130120	that's what I did. There was this game I kept seeing on sale for the last, I say month,
6130120	6136120	month and a half called Chris tales. And I looked at some of the videos. I was just like, I don't
6136120	6141880	know. I don't know if this is a game I want to play, but it was on game pass. And I'm like,
6141880	6147240	you know what? I'm going to give it a try. And you know, I started playing it and I'm like,
6147240	6152600	you know what? I actually liked this game. This game's pretty awesome.
6154280	6162040	Let's see how much it is. $19.99 for digital download. Okay, fine. I decided, you know what,
6162040	6170440	let me check for a physical copy. Just, just because found it on Amazon for 10 bucks. So
6171080	6175880	that day I downloaded Chris tales and played it for about two hours and said how much I really
6175880	6182600	enjoyed it within half hour after that went on Amazon ordered the game and had it the next day.
6182600	6191480	Wow. Okay. So to me, game pass is just like a digital version of blockbuster video. You know,
6191480	6197560	well, it's Netflix really, you know, it's, we keep talking about the, the switch and trying
6197560	6201960	to get Nintendo switch online to be the Netflix of gaming. And it's like game pass. That's
6201960	6207800	literally what game pass is doing. It's Netflix gaming. Now the problem is like Netflix things
6207800	6214120	disappear. And so you might, you know, like say like me, I was playing final fantasy 12 remastered.
6214120	6218280	I didn't beat it, but the game's now no longer on game pass. Now I could have bought it. I could
6218280	6223000	have done what you did, or I could, you know, whether it was through the storefront with a
6223000	6227560	discount, whatever digitally, or I could have got it on Amazon, but I didn't. And it's gone now,
6228360	6233320	but I still feel that I'm still getting a good value out of game pass because at least I got to
6233320	6237480	try it for as long as I did. And I know that I enjoyed it. And it's kind of like, you know,
6237480	6242040	you and this game and, and you know, what other people talked about, like Bobby getting forza
6242040	6245720	horizon and paying for it, even though he's getting it through game pass as well. You know,
6245800	6250680	it's a good way to like try stuff and, you know, make sure that you will have it
6251720	6258600	after it gets removed from Netflix of gaming. Yep. This is the game I have picked up like this.
6258600	6263400	Like there's a game called Scarlet Nexus that was on game pass. It still is. I'm just like,
6263960	6268280	this is fun. This is a great game. It was on sale during the holidays. I was like,
6270360	6274520	let me add that to the collection. I'm still playing through the game. The original copy
6274520	6279720	is still sealed sitting on the shelf next to the 50 plus other games I've bought during the
6279720	6286360	pandemic because it was on sale and I'm like, I'll get to it. And in reality, yeah, I will probably
6286360	6290600	get to it when I have to take a personal day from work and just kind of go through some of these
6290600	6298360	games. But Rob, if Final Fantasy 12, if it's a good deal on Amazon, let's say you see it for like
6298360	6304680	under 20 bucks, will you pull the trigger on it? Probably, but you know, you know, you've,
6304680	6310200	you've been listening to my ass rant about games long enough to know that I get distracted by other
6310200	6315320	stuff all the time, including going back to this MMO that I've been playing forever,
6316040	6321960	going back to always content going game like No Man's Sky. It's very hard to me to fit it
6321960	6327480	into the schedule to go back to Final Fantasy 12. But I think it's a great game and I'd love to pick
6327480	6331720	it up. There's a part of me that wonders, maybe they'll release it again on PlayStation five and
6331720	6336600	series x, who knows? I don't know anything's possible. But yeah, if I if I saw it on a deep
6336600	6340760	discount, I might be tempted, it would probably be one of those things where it's like, my husband
6340760	6344840	convinces me to actually go in a GameStop because he does that occasionally, like we'll be eating
6344840	6348120	at a place next door. And he's like, let's just go and GameStop and see what they have. And then
6348120	6352760	I see it in the bin for like five bucks. And I'll probably be like, I can't say no to that. Let's
6352760	6358680	get it. That's usually how it goes. Yeah, exactly. Because what you had mentioned,
6358680	6365000	FF 12, you talked about the different Final Fantasies. I'm like, I never finished 13.
6365000	6374680	Because the week that I bought it, my roommate sat down and turned his fiance into a gamer widow
6374680	6377720	and just finish that game within a month. And it's like,
6379880	6385880	okay, all all three, all the Final Fantasy 13 games are on game pass right now.
6386600	6390600	Yeah, the thing is, I went out and bought them for PlayStation three. I'm like, you know what,
6390600	6396920	I'm going to play on PS three and go through them. Now that my PlayStation three sound sounds like
6399000	6403480	a janky shuttle rocket when you turn it on. I'm like, yeah, no, I'm going to wait.
6403480	6409960	Now that I see that it's on game pass, because I was originally going to buy the 360 ones and just
6409960	6418120	do the upgrade button. You know what, that just takes me $45. Yep. And it's it plays best on
6418120	6423240	series x than anywhere else. Because the loading times getting eliminated is huge for the game.
6423960	6430280	And the cutscenes being re rendered in 720 means the game, you know, I PC is comparable, I suppose,
6430280	6437800	but series runs the game extremely well. Most definitely, you know, because it's like,
6437800	6444840	I realize that I've been giving so much love and attention to my series x that I've come to the
6444840	6452120	conclusion. I don't want a PlayStation five. I can wait a little bit longer. There's only like two
6452120	6458520	games on there that I want Horizon Forbidden West and remake integrate, you know,
6460040	6465800	Forbidden West is on PS four, to be fair. I have a feeling you're going to drop remake
6465800	6472120	integrated for PS four as well. It's going to happen. I'm just gonna wait. I'm in no rush.
6472840	6478360	That and if you see where my series is in my entertainment cabinet, there's barely enough
6478360	6483480	room for the PlayStation five or how tall that sucker is. Definitely a redesign, please.
6484680	6489800	Yeah, I'm hoping a redesign is in the future. That's for sure. So and yeah,
6489800	6493560	Bobby is saying there's nothing in the iffy DLC that requires the PlayStation five. Yeah,
6493560	6497880	I kind of heard that too. It's just it's just a thing to get people on that system.
6497880	6503880	I hope the remake comes out for Xbox, though, just for completion sake, but I get it. They've
6503880	6508200	Sony's paying them money, and they're getting good for it. So then it's understandable.
6509480	6515160	It's just two words. Eye candy. Let's be real. They release it for PC. So it's just a matter
6515160	6523080	of time before it hits Xbox, you know, so come on. But this summer will be a year since that DLC
6523080	6530120	came out for PS five. So if they don't do more DLC this year, maybe the Xbox will get its release
6530120	6533400	this year if it's going to get it but I'm not I'm not going to get my hopes up. It is what it is.
6534360	6539000	I'll get around to it eventually. For sure. Anything else on your night on your mind tonight,
6539000	6545720	my friend? Ah, halo the TV series. Oh, yeah, I haven't watched that. How's that?
6551000	6554520	Okay, let me I'm gonna say this because this is what I'm reading in your face.
6555320	6559880	There's an amazing drag queen out there named says I get to talk about drag queens with the emails.
6559880	6567080	There's an amazing drag queen named Tatiana out there. And when she watched another contestant do
6567080	6573080	a really bad routine during the talent show and all stars too. She said to the camera, she goes,
6573080	6578520	you know, in life, we get to make a lot of choices. And that that was a choice.
6580600	6587560	Now, I understand when there is an adaptation of something sometimes it's a call as part of
6587560	6592520	the universal whatever it is. Okay, fine. I want to take for example, Sailor Moon,
6592520	6596600	you have classic, you have crystal, you have the deke dub, and they're like,
6596600	6601080	pick whatever one you want. It still makes sense to you. It's still part of the quote unquote
6601080	6606600	universe, whichever one it is. It's all good. You got it. Halo on the other hand.
6611000	6613560	Let's say this is the whole this is the Lord Halo.
6613560	6615560	No.
6617400	6622680	Rama had a big book he was holding up. And then he just threw it behind his shoulder. So I have to
6624040	6628840	they didn't play the games at all. From what I hear. They just said, Oh, well, we'll just
6628840	6631960	adapt the characters without knowing anything about him. It sounds like
6632520	6639640	Yeah, I'm gonna tell you this now. You're not going to like of how they put the UNSC. But
6639640	6647080	if you can make it through the first episode, it gets better. You just got to make it past
6647080	6650760	the first episode. And if you don't, I do not blame you.
6653160	6657160	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the good news about the Halo series is game pass has a 30 day
6657160	6661480	Paramount Plus free trial. So we might be pulling the trigger on that just to see if we can justify
6661480	6667560	it. Ask your friend in California to borrow the login because he rarely logs in just saying funny,
6667560	6670200	if you really want to watch it. There's ways to make that happen.
6672360	6675000	You can watch all the Star Trek to while you're at it. So
6676600	6683640	on if you want, I think worth it's worth the time. So anyway, yeah, thank you for the review
6683640	6693240	of the Halo TV show. So Loki, have you been watching it? No, no, no. All right. I check.
6693720	6699160	I just hope that you know, now that video game TV shows are becoming all the rage. Thanks to
6699160	6703720	Castlevania. Thanks to the Witcher. Yes, I know the Witcher was a book. But let's be real,
6703720	6708120	the games are what made that TV show. Because of all this stuff getting turned into TV shows.
6708760	6712600	Please, please consult the source material because I'm saying they're supposed to be doing a show
6712600	6717560	about Final Fantasy 14. And I'm not talking about the dad of light. I'm talking about the actual
6717640	6733560	fantasy 14 show. Do not fuck that up. Do not fuck that up. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. It's not even
6733560	6742040	Rama. Rama. Rama. Rama. Rama. I'm gonna call I'm gonna call you Adam. Adam. Yes, yes. Here's the
6742040	6747240	thing you have been you may not play the game yourself. But you have been to enough anime
6747240	6755480	conventions. You have seen enough M itself. You have seen enough cosplay from 14. You have seen
6755480	6765880	enough the fandom, you know, my friend, the makers that show better not fuck it up. Mr. Roberts,
6766760	6773080	sir, my liege. I understand. Remember, there was Final Fantasy The spirits within
6773640	6781640	now. We all know how that went about. But there was an anime called Final Fantasy Unlimited
6782440	6789000	that came out. Oh, I remember that. It was so bad. It was canceled halfway through
6789000	6794760	and the last 26 episodes were turned into a colored manga. What does that tell you?
6794760	6803160	I understand. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Don't the expectations for the show
6803160	6809480	aren't that high. It's based off of Final Fantasy 14 version one. So you know, it's okay.
6810760	6814360	I mean, honestly, if I if I want to watch a bad adaptation,
6814360	6818600	I'll go I'll go grab my art of fighting anime every watch it. Okay.
6818600	6823320	I'll go I'll go watch Double Dragon the movie.
6825560	6830120	I will say this much. I saw that in the theaters. I liked it for what it was.
6830120	6836360	But I'd sooner watch Double Dragon over DOA or the King of Fighters movie. Okay.
6836360	6841640	They're there. You know, it's funny as I asked him about Double Dragon when he came into our
6841640	6846840	work that one time I can't remember the guy's name was Scott Wolf. Scott Wolf. Yeah. Are you
6847080	6851800	our work? Yeah. Party five guy. Yeah. So he came into my old job because, you know,
6851800	6857400	we used to sell games and stuff like that. So yeah, we did ask him about Double Dragon and
6857400	6862360	stuff. And he thought it was all right. But like, you know, he knows what it was.
6863000	6868440	There's you remember actors are just like you and me. Right. And for a lot of them,
6868440	6874840	it's a paycheck. It's a job. You know what? Hey, that movie was a turd. But it bought me this
6874840	6879720	house. Like I literally saw somebody say that in an interview. That movie sucked. But it bought
6879720	6891880	me this house. The man speaking is speaking the gospel. I mean, who really won? We all lost,
6891880	6897160	but the actors won. That's fine. It's fine. Oh, yeah. Bobby Blackwell. Jeremy Irons said
6897160	6903320	about that nineties Dungeons and Dragons movie. I had a castle to pay off. Oh God,
6903320	6909640	I actually forgot about that. Oh, yes. And I was excited about that movie too. We all were
6912040	6919080	anyway. Let's be real. The best nineties movie adaptation was Mortal Kombat. Okay. That was it.
6919080	6923800	During the nineties, Mortal Kombat set the standard and everything else just hit the wall.
6924520	6928840	I liked Silent Hill, but that was the odds. That was the next decade, I suppose. But I thought the
6928840	6935160	Silent Hill movie was pretty good for a video. I like that. I'd be, I would be really interested
6935160	6942280	for them to revisit Silent Hill today, actually. And I don't understand why we, I mean, they
6942280	6945720	stopped making shitty sequels, right? They only did the one sequel and they didn't do any after
6945720	6949000	that. Like they kept threatening to, but they didn't do it right. I think that's something
6949000	6952840	they should explore in a TV show, but what do I know? I'm just a schmo with a podcast.
6952840	6960840	Good TV show. But again, consult the source material, please, before adapting it for a TV
6960840	6969320	show. But maybe, okay, conversely, a lot of people reacting very positively to the Sonic movie,
6969320	6976760	right? But why is the Sonic movie so good? Because the guy that directed it like has an affinity for
6976760	6982120	the Sonic franchise and worked on the Dreamcast game or something, right? Like did some of the
6982120	6986840	full motion video capture for some of the old Sonic games. So it's like, they knew the source
6986840	6991480	material. This was not somebody that was just trying to do Sonic cause, Oh, my kid likes that.
6992760	6997880	See now that's another one. Sonic, the Sonic movies. I like to call based on the Sonic
6997880	7002360	universes because you had Saturday morning, Sonic, which was based off the Archie comics
7002360	7008360	and its own universe. You had Sonic X, which was its own universe, the Sonic OVAs. And then you
7008360	7015720	had the Sonic games, the movies pulled from the more recent games and then kind of went on its
7015720	7021800	own little path. And that's what I liked. It got the great elements of everything and it went on
7021800	7029320	its own path, you know, like welcome to green Hills, you know, that was great. Robotnik in
7029320	7035640	that mushroom zone, which was a planet. That was great. I forgot about some of the lore from the
7035640	7040760	games that they brought in. I'm like, this is good, you know? So I like where they're going
7040760	7045880	with it, you know? All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show,
7045880	7050840	but it is always fantastic to hear you Rama. And I hope people are listening on Tuesdays for anime
7050840	7056440	jam session, where we can hear about all the cosplay, all the terrible anime, and most
7056440	7063400	importantly, all the drama happening at anime conventions near you. That will be this Tuesday
7063400	7068200	when we talk when we finally get around to talking about Zenkai con 2022 fun con a little
7068200	7073960	chaotic, but you know, we survived all the good things are. All right, my friend. Take care. Great
7073960	7080520	to talk to you. Have a good night. Bye bye. All right, the one and only DJ Rama s here on orange
7080520	7085400	launch radio. With that, I think we're gonna wrap things up for the night. Loki, did you have any
7085400	7089880	last minute stories you want to get out? No, I didn't have anything. Well, then how about a final
7089880	7094040	thought before we get to that? I'll say thank you as always for listening to orange launch radio,
7094040	7098200	whether this was your first episode or your 900th. Appreciate you guys. I'll be in here.
7098200	7102680	I suppose we have to start talking about the 20th year show and figure out what we want to do for
7102680	7106360	that. I just realized that six that's like six weeks away, maybe. No, that'd be the beginning
7106360	7111560	of June six weeks away. So we're like 10 weeks away from all ours 20th anniversary,
7111560	7118680	which is pretty wild. So yeah, anyway, be thinking about that. Thank you for being here with orange
7118680	7122040	launch radio. Tell a friend about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where
7122040	7126920	every gamer has a voice. But we could use some more voices here to get all of the your opinions
7126920	7132440	and things out on air and all that good stuff. Oh, thanks for the reminder. Matt packs East is this
7132440	7136120	week. I don't know if we'll get a lot of announcements for PAX East. It's not usually
7136120	7141640	that kind of show. But the panels. Sometimes the developers can't keep their mouth shut in those
7141640	7148120	panels. There might be a little things that trickle out of that. Maybe any stuff to move fun. So also,
7148840	7153160	a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, Google Play, wherever you found this
7153160	7158520	podcast. Five star review goes a long way. So thank you as always for those. And please consider
7158520	7164920	following us on Twitch at bog network VOG network and our discord server vog network.com slash
7164920	7170920	discord. That is otherwise going to do it. Dark soccer will be with me next week. And we'll hear
7170920	7178200	all about a trip this weekend. Otherwise, we won't have Loki but we wish you well. Thank you. Please
7178280	7182600	update me via text so I can let the listeners know. But I'm sure everything's gonna go great.
7182600	7187560	So yeah, I'm hoping it goes great. And I'm enjoying gonna enjoy my week off
7187560	7193560	from work. Enjoy it. Have a nice daycation. Hopefully, you get some good pills. So
7194200	7196200	Loki, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
7197640	7202680	No, just basically go sub to my YouTube channel if you haven't yet. I just want to get to 500
7202680	7206600	subs so that I can actually use their community features. Oh, nice. It's so stupid that the gate
7206600	7210920	that stuff behind subscriptions, but it'd be nice to be able to post like, you know,
7210920	7214760	text posts saying, Hey, here's what I'm working on that type of stuff. But can't do that until
7214760	7221320	like 500 subs. I don't know. It's dumb. All right. And my final thought is I'll plug my
7221320	7226440	personal Twitch channel at Rob Roberts because I'm trying to work on getting more follows for
7227960	7232520	in advance of TwitchCon later this year and working on my No Man's Sky playthrough. I'm
7232520	7236120	actually going to do that again later tonight. Well after the show, I'm not going to do it
7236200	7240200	immediately after the show. Like Jamie usually does her thing because I like physically can't.
7240200	7245960	But later tonight, I'll get into that. And also I'm streaming more Final Fantasy 14 and getting
7245960	7251640	into PVP this week. So hope to see you there. So thanks for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
7251640	7255560	When we all come together, we have a great time. Thanks for being here and we'll see you in seven
