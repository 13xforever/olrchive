00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
This week, a bunch of Nintendo emulation rumors made the rounds.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,440
This is your reminder that Nintendo has done emulation multiple times already and the slowness

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,760
of rolling out games is less technical, though programming is always some part of it but

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,200
more often licensing.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,840
The Nintendo Switch Online SP games are a cute addition that is most thoroughly technical

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,200
and I appreciate Nintendo's effort to add a new twist into these games as well.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,960
This is just one throwback content headline.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,960
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,880
this rumor and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now in the show where

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,960
every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,720
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,640
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,920
Orange Lounge Radio.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:56,200
We are live once again with episode number 911 of our show for tonight, April the 24th

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,960
of 2022.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,920
And as I was as was pointed out to me on the Bobby Blackwell show before our show tonight,

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,200
apparently the 10 year anniversary of VOG Network which soft launched about what April

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,440
26th or so in 2012.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
How about that?

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,040
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,400
Oh, hi.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Hi Dark Sakura.

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
How are you?

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm all right.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
How are you?

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,680
I'm doing well.

27
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,840
Let me just take a quick minute to point out not joining us tonight.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,640
Unfortunately, Tech Master Loki, as mentioned on a previous episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,240
Loki had surgery earlier this week.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,200
He's been giving updates through his Twitter account at Loki O-L-R.

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,560
And I am pleased to report he is out of surgery doing fine.

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,840
And I think in one of his tweets, he said it was getting better every hour.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,460
So he's just he's just at that point where he's got to let the body heal.

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,740
So I would imagine instead of doing the show tonight, he's sleeping.

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,260
And quite frankly, what a great thing to be doing.

36
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,140
I think, you know, and Dark Sakura, myself perfectly healthy, but a nap sounds great,

37
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,260
to be honest.

38
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,260
So anyway,

39
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,300
Honestly, many naps sound great.

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,860
I we're going I start back in the office one day a week, starting tomorrow.

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,700
And the whole thought is just filling me with like bits and pieces of dread.

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:31,100
Because the moment if I if I get sick, I'm taking it to HR.

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,820
Is everybody going back the same day or are they staggering it?

44
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,100
I think you get to pick your one day a week out of like, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.

45
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,620
Okay, so there's a chance not everybody will be there the same day.

46
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,540
So it's a little bit Yeah, but still, now.

47
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:56,140
Now that you know, really, vaccinated or boosted status really isn't doing a whole lot to,

48
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,540
to starve off who gets sick, just the severity of it.

49
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,020
Um, I've got concerns then again, I came back from Disneyland just fine.

50
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,980
I was gonna say let's talk about the happy stuff.

51
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,460
You weren't here last week.

52
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,940
No, no surgery.

53
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,460
It was a birthday thing that you were doing last week.

54
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,460
Yeah, it was my birthday.

55
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,420
My birthday is very important holiday.

56
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,660
But you you went to Disneyland.

57
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,660
I did.

58
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:28,340
I am I had a very, very good time, although my body certainly reminded me that it it's

59
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:37,640
it's not a teenager, even though I tried to run around like I was so, so it actually my

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,780
whole thing started before then because Sunday I wasn't I wasn't here.

61
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:51,700
So what I ended up doing is I drove down on Sunday kind of rushed my way down and stayed

62
00:03:51,700 --> 00:04:00,860
with Marissa, and Chris is our lovely friend, Marissa, who has been on the show a few times

63
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:08,180
and been in chat does some voice acting stuff, which is Yeah, I haven't seen Marissa in years.

64
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,660
So it was a really pleasant visit.

65
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,300
So you had a good time.

66
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:20,420
And then, and the area that that the two of them live in is actually really pretty.

67
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,460
I'd never been to the Moorpark before.

68
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,960
And it's sort of up in the hills.

69
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,300
And it was a little bit harrowing of a drive because my maps took me kind of a backwards

70
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
way.

71
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,500
But I'm glad it did because it was really pretty.

72
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:44,740
And then the next day, I went to pick up Tiara, which cements how much I hate LAX.

73
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:55,300
And so I managed to get Tiara out of the clutches of the the worldway traffic.

74
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,540
And we went to Anaheim and had sort of a late lunch at this place called Requiem, which

75
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,140
is a Final Fantasy themed coffee bar.

76
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,900
I had no idea there was a place like that.

77
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
That's cool.

78
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,900
It's beautiful.

79
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,900
Oh, awesome.

80
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,900
It's not far from the park, you know, so it's near where our hotel was, even though I got

81
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,820
bad directions because I put in the wrong days in.

82
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,460
There's like 50 million days in.

83
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
Oh, yeah.

84
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,220
They're all days in by the park, need to specify which ones which.

85
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,100
So so we spent a really decent amount of time there.

86
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,820
It was really, really, you know, and they serve you like these little toasties.

87
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:42,500
I had a Caprice one, which was, you know, basil and mozzarella and tomato, and it had

88
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,060
this like really good balsamic glaze on it.

89
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:52,420
And I laughed because Tiara had edamame toast, and I was calling it Japanese beans on toast

90
00:05:52,420 --> 00:06:00,700
because edamame beans, you know, and and then we went to the hotel.

91
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,780
We had like dinner at Shakey's, which I've never been to Shakey's Dan thinks that I didn't

92
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,760
even know they still existed.

93
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,820
That's what blew my because you texted me that right next door to our hotel.

94
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,500
Yeah, you texted me that you were a tiara at Shakey's and I was like, they're still

95
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
around.

96
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,020
Like they all the Did you know the original I mean, you probably didn't but I'm gonna

97
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
share it anyway.

98
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,540
The original Shakey's pizza was in Sacramento.

99
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,620
The very first Shakey's pizza was Sacramento.

100
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,660
It's now the mimosa house down on 65th.

101
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,380
That was the original Shakey's.

102
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,940
So I and I remember Dan telling me about it before.

103
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,620
Yeah, and it's it's it's wild that like they're still open because they are they're all gone

104
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,620
here.

105
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,620
I haven't seen one in years.

106
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,660
But yeah, the the big wooden doors.

107
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,660
Yeah.

108
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,660
And the arcade they always had a really big arcade area like most roundtables games there.

109
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Yeah.

110
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,540
I really wanted to play like like a deer hunting and some Oh, like, well, it's a Walmart arcade

111
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,540
at this point.

112
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
Gross.

113
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
Kind of.

114
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,860
Um, but they put way too much basil on my pizza.

115
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,300
I was like, I love basil and this is excessive.

116
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:11,740
So and so the next day we went in for opening and our mutual friend Nick was came to meet

117
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:18,460
us and I he actually ran into traffic so it was a little bit late but then he hung out

118
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:25,820
for a decent time traffic in LA what no no Nick straight next streamer here on Twitch

119
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:33,380
you and I have both rated him a million times yeah so really just just a cool guy all together

120
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:40,580
really sweet really fun to hang out with and then after after a little bit he rode a California

121
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,840
screaming with us or not screaming it's a credit coaster yeah credit coaster yeah and

122
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,860
and we we we just had a really good time and then he had to go off and it was me and tiara

123
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:58,060
for a while and we had dinner at Carthay circle I got a really delicious drink it's

124
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:04,380
like branding creme de cacao and coffee and cream but it like it kind of got my stomach

125
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,540
funny and I had Moroccan meatballs which I should have realized that there was going

126
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,580
to be something spicy in it so I ended up like having a slight allergic reaction but

127
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,980
it wasn't bad but I mean I got to pilot the Millennium Falcon I wish I had been right

128
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,620
pilot next time I want to be a gunner the gunners look like they had a lot more fun

129
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,180
is the gunner the one that just pushes the button the whole time because I think that's

130
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,020
what I did that's the engineer okay that's why I just yeah I just kept pushing a button

131
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,020
in the back row you're an engineer I thought I was in the middle but I it was a while ago

132
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,940
then you're a gunner okay I don't remember it was a while ago the pilots had a decent

133
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,380
amount of stuff to do but I I wanted to do the hyperdrive so I'm gonna wait and do that

134
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:51,900
next time it was really really cool I I had a good time with that one I really enjoyed

135
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:59,260
it the sense of motion was fairly realistic too and we did you know we did Haunted Mansion

136
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:05,820
we did Indy we did Jungle Cruise we had a really really good tour guide who I'm fairly

137
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,860
certain was non-binary and had some really funny Mean Girls oriented jokes fun did you

138
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,380
get to do Rise of the Resistance or too crazy I didn't do Rise of the Resistance it had

139
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,620
I didn't put in for the thing and honestly I was like it's a hassle the only thing I

140
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:29,300
really wanted to do was with Smugglers Run okay I had blue milk I will go on record right

141
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:36,500
now saying that if your throat is sore drink the blue milk it is somewhat coating and very

142
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,720
relaxing but the other good news it's been a week now since you've been back and no symptoms

143
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,440
of the big C so and I did a rapid test oh good good and so my rapid test was negative I also

144
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:55,120
though on the way out after I took Tiara to LAX I had lunch with Nick again and I was supposed to

145
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:03,160
meet Isaac oh but work got in the way of that so it was just me and Nick and we went to really good

146
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:12,400
yakiniku place hmm it's like the Japanese version of Korean barbecue yummy so um really good and

147
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,640
then I had I stopped at the grapevine after the grapevine to get myself a massage and one of those

148
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,400
like beat-you-up massage chairs because they're great and then I was checking the time for the

149
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:32,320
Bravo cheese farm which is my other resort that I go to 99 or 5 version 99 okay because I always

150
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,480
take 99 back that's the one for me is the one I go to that has the llama that gives no fucks

151
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,400
because you know they built one like at the exact same place on i-5 yeah it's funny it's yeah two

152
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,380
of them I know but I have to go to the one on 99 that's the one hmm and so I thought oh no they

153
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:57,640
close at seven so I booked it I like was doing a hundred in my Fiat TV I made it on 99 like I

154
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,720
there's a part so so for those not from the area there's two major freeways 99 with me you know I

155
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,320
know but I was to say for those not from from the California there's two major freeways that connect

156
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,400
like Sacramento NorCal and LA you can take 99 or the five it's it's and five is usually like

157
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,240
trucker route cows nothing there 99 goes through all the towns like Stockton Modesto Fresno Bakersfield

158
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,280
like all the towns in the valley you're going through on 99 so there's more to do on 99 but

159
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,280
five is the one where you can drive a little faster because there's like no but less people

160
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,440
on it but truckers and you know cows inside of the road now more cops on five now it doesn't

161
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,360
totally surprise me people people do drive crazy on five like not just me they were doing some

162
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:48,720
construction though on 99 but I was I was pretty I mean I drive a Fiat so when the lanes went narrow

163
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,680
I could still maintain speed and it was it wasn't that bad but when I got there they're like oh no

164
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,680
we're open till eight we changed it we just didn't do it on our website and I'm like fuck's sake so I

165
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,680
hung around and they have more animals there but that that alpaca still gives no fucks he was just

166
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,840
like I'm just gonna sit here whatever I'm bored I made friends with a goat and then I watched the

167
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,200
funniest thing I actually have this little video of it where there's a bunny hutch now oh by the

168
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,360
way I played with Marissa's bunny Snoopy who I I'm in love with that rabbit I'm gonna go back and

169
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,120
steal him but the bunnies in the hutch like I caught two of them they look like they were

170
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,920
just cuddling so they like a little video of the bunnies cuddling and then the other bunnies okay

171
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,240
it's time to fuck and the girl bunnies like fuck you I'm not into this and she like bounces off and

172
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,320
the bunnies following or trying to mount again over and over and finally she just like turns

173
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,080
around at him and then she bounces off and he finally gets the idea but I'm like you tell him

174
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,040
you tell him little girl bunny tell him you are not down you tell him to take no for an answer

175
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,360
lady bunny all right not being lady bunny I didn't mean that in lady bunny way she didn't

176
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,200
have on nearly enough wigs let me let me go to the chat believe it or not it's a video game podcast

177
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,120
we'll get into that too but I do want to go to the chat over at twitch.tv slash of hog network

178
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,440
where we do tape live every Sunday night nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after

179
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,600
the Bobby Blackwell show and Mike Deft is asking the five covers the whole state doesn't it

180
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:26,840
yeah it ends in TJ it like the San Diego and Mexico border that's where five starts in the

181
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,160
south and it goes all the way it goes through Portland through Seattle all the way and ends

182
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,680
in Canada at that that town I can't remember the name of the town way up there in North

183
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,120
Washington but basically Vancouver because they change the freeway changes names you get into

184
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,280
Canada but basically it takes you to Vancouver Bellevue no Bellevues before now it's another

185
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,560
B name but I can't remember the name off top my head but way up way up it's not far north of

186
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,160
Seattle it's only like as I think the Canadian border is only like an hour or two north of

187
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:01,560
Seattle if that so yeah but anyway yeah five five is preferred I still prefer 99 it goes three lanes

188
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,640
more often you've got more truck stops you know yeah there's more to do there's more to see

189
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,120
exactly and for me given that I'm still having that issue with you know my alertness

190
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,440
for me being able to stop like that it was a good idea sorry I have cat drama going on behind me

191
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,480
like smoosh always arguing yeah smoosh just chased cheddar in here I'm trying to see

192
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,120
I can't even see where cheddar ended up he must have went behind the couch they ran in here so

193
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,360
fast don't worry I'm sure folks in chat are dying to see the cats if I if I catch one of them I'll

194
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,520
show them on stream don't worry so but yeah they're still they're still getting used to

195
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,400
they're still getting used to each other so is cheddar coming out of his uh little shell a bit

196
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,680
more he is oh he's at my feet he's he's getting better he's less shy than he was but like smoosh

197
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,320
will pick on him like smoosh is starting to be an aggressor smoosh will like follow him around and

198
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,960
then like do this thing where he goes and like snort like right at him like he's and then cheddar

199
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,240
just books it and smoosh will follow him like that's their way of like playing lately now

200
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,960
cheddar's like at my feet and refuses to move super adorable so anyway you hear any meowing

201
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:19,160
that's what's going on is they're basically taunting each other so all right wait cheddar

202
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,720
cheddar hold on buy me time dark sagra okay um I have five dollars and that will buy you two

203
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:34,040
seconds of time haha um I don't know if smoosh is trying to be dominant though it just doesn't seem

204
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,480
cheddar didn't like that oh yeah well cheddar is a very shy boy yeah he is

205
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,000
so he let me he let me uh boop his nose he's super adorable like whenever I'm napping or

206
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,720
I'm asleep cheddar will run in and like wants to like lie on top of me and purrs really loud he's

207
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,040
just I think he's very very happy to be um indoors because we were it's interesting so I started

208
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,120
cheddar and instagram and just through the whole process the people that found cheddar actually

209
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,000
follow him on instagram because the adoption agency like you know we were we were fine with

210
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,840
the link being given out or whatever so they they put him in touch and so we got to see because I

211
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,280
I looked at one of the instagram and I got I could see um that uh I could see a picture of cheddar

212
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,240
when he was found and they really cleaned him up like he he was not in good shape when he was found

213
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,560
so but he's so adorable now you have to send me that link later yeah I will for sure

214
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:38,040
so uh pod culture and chat says so is one more each dad's kitty it does seem right now anyway

215
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,680
that smoosh follows alan around a little more and cheddar follows me around a little more but

216
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,640
I don't like I also really don't want to play favorites like I love them both um it's just you

217
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,040
know whatever it's what it is so yeah all right uh let's get into some video game news I mean we

218
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,320
could have a cat podcast tonight I suppose you know considering that Pax East was this weekend

219
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,720
I feel like the news is still a little bit light all things considered so you know what we probably

220
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,920
could fill up three hours about cats but we will get into the news and we're going to start tonight

221
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,560
talking about Nintendo and you know uh workers rights in the video game industry is something

222
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,440
that's really been a theme on our show for the past couple years honestly and everything really

223
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,760
came to a climax when we were talking about Activision Blizzard and still everything that's

224
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,520
going on there I know you have an update on that later in the show um but this week the eye of

225
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,800
workers rights in the industry has turned to Nintendo um there's a lot of game blogs are

226
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:39,400
are talking about a Nintendo staffer who says that their right to unionize was violated and this is

227
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:46,680
per a complaint that was filed with the national labor relations board um this also it should should

228
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,760
be very important to point out this is a lot to do with contractors rights as well because

229
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:59,000
contractors are really used a lot in the gaming industry I think more than is talked about quite

230
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,280
honestly um contractors sometimes known as like temp agencies is another you know big thing

231
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,520
contractors are a way to find labor very fast because a lot of your contractors have already

232
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,640
done things like screening interviewing and so forth so they know that somebody's like ready to

233
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,360
go um and you it's it's a good way a lot of times for companies to find uh folks to hire long term

234
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,840
as well I got my job that I was at for 14 years through through a contractor temp temp agency

235
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,240
yeah I'm heading on nine years so it's it you know for first but of course dark soccer and I

236
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,760
also don't work in the games industry so it's uh you know um but this uh uh contracting company

237
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:51,640
that Nintendo uses um Aston Carter which is a global hiring firm uh the uh worker is uh

238
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,800
basically claiming the both of them violated their legal legally protected right to unionize and this

239
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,680
was a complaint that was made with the national labor relations board on Friday what happens is

240
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,800
that this contractor alleges that Nintendo of America and Aston Carter said they did concerted

241
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,600
activities and quote coercive actions to interfere with their right to organize um now the

242
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,960
filing only has broad charges so we don't know like who was involved what was involved we don't

243
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,200
know any of the specifics but per report from Axios quote the allegations were likely to include

244
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,320
claims of surveillance threats retaliation and either a layoff or refusal to hire um that's also

245
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:40,600
mentioned in a similar article from protocol um there will be an investigation but a lot of folks

246
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,080
saying you know what probably not nothing's going to happen uh a University of California Berkeley

247
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,240
professor and labor expert Harley Shaken said in an interview if the NLRB is listing these

248
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,880
allegations it's pretty serious and their ability to act is very real after these allegations came

249
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,680
out a twitter user known as the boy came out and said they worked at Nintendo and said working for

250
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,880
Nintendo contract for three years was one of the most stressful and awful experiences of my life

251
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,280
co-workers were great but i was constantly under pressure of being let go for little things like

252
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,240
going to the bathroom or being stuck in traffic an extra two minutes before work additionally they

253
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,120
have an awful practice of dangling the carrot a full-time employee to contract so they almost

254
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,800
universally never hire on just to keep exploiting them and keep them quiet i spoke up to try and

255
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:36,760
better things for co-workers main reason i was let go tbh um again a lot of this to me speaks

256
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,600
to contractors rights i mean there's a few things going on with this story right number one we've

257
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,240
said from the very beginning since these Activision Blizzard reports came out and even before that

258
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,920
this is an industry problem right so if you thought Nintendo was immune from this type of

259
00:20:52,920 --> 00:21:00,920
stuff i mean surprise now i get Nintendo of America i guess we could be thankful for a moment

260
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,960
at least we're not hearing anything about sexism or you know some of those more serious things

261
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,240
we've heard coming out of the activisions and like you know uh that that whole he was gonna

262
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,760
kill his secretary or something allegedly i'm sorry i'm totally butchering the quotes but there

263
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,960
was some really messed up stuff that came out of the activision stuff right you know i i feel

264
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,800
awkward sitting here going at least it's just contractors rights but i don't i don't want to

265
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,560
diminish the situation either i mean this whole thing about they could get fired for the littlest

266
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:38,440
thing this is why a lot of companies and not just the tech industry quite frankly go to contractor

267
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:46,600
agencies because yeah it is really easy to let somebody go sometimes i think the contractor

268
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,800
agencies are predatory practice i see but it's it's weird because i also feel like it's biting

269
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,640
the hands that feed me a little bit because sometimes it's worked out my favor in the past

270
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,840
you know as far as like getting in with a big company um it just felt though for some of us

271
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:09,320
i would expect the majority don't work out yeah no and i i'm i'm all for like this whole

272
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,800
practice of how this works getting scrutinized and getting looked at and contractors rights

273
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,800
being taken seriously please don't misunderstand me with what i'm saying um but i just say this

274
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,320
a lot of these things that are being talked about i don't think are unique to tech either i think

275
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:35,800
this is a lot with contractors and you know just in general how that all works so uh going to the

276
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:41,160
chat because you know our chat is going to light up at this uh over at twitch.tv slash vog network

277
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,800
deejirama says i kind of think that this person is mad that nintendo wouldn't flip their contract

278
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:53,880
over to fte maybe so i mean but you know we talked about like the dangling carrot and all

279
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,480
of that stuff maybe there is a frustration there you give and give and give and you expect that you

280
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,400
know maybe you're going to move up the ladder maybe get some of the benefits you know and

281
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,480
stuff that comes with being a full-time employee maybe it does get frustrating when time and again

282
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:15,000
that doesn't happen for whatever so uh fanara in chat says contractors equals first one out the

283
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,280
door yes as well like if there's ever a layoff or something like that almost always yeah contractors

284
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:30,440
like unless they're highly specialized almost always yeah um deejirama s also says well even

285
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,360
as a contractor you have to still follow the handbook of the company but they really can't

286
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:41,480
fire you over silly stuff um quest bus they can reach out to the the contracting company and say

287
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,400
that you're not a good fit i i have seen it and i i'll speak openly about this because it's not

288
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,200
my current company and it's not you know anything where any of us are affiliated with currently but

289
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,280
i've absolutely seen it where a person didn't show up to work for two days in a row and somebody

290
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,640
would call the contract agency and say could you just let them know we don't need them back

291
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,600
and send somebody else and it didn't even it didn't even really matter what the reason is

292
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,280
just they they we needed them they weren't here let's do somebody else and that's what you know

293
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,960
happens with contractors um and they can totally do it as retaliation i i was working with a

294
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,520
mortgage company once that they were violating several federal laws and i called them on it

295
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,880
and i told them why and i showed them the laws and like when i do this work i'm going to be

296
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,840
documenting every piece of it i'm not going to have anything that i do come back and bite me

297
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,400
and they let me go and yeah and then i filed it and then i filed a complaint and the company

298
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,520
was gone a year later yeah and you know you know she just doesn't fit in with the culture here

299
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,360
yeah i'm not gonna break the law for you

300
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,080
anyway well they didn't last the the year because i'm not the only one that filed the complaint too

301
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:03,720
yeah so anyway um just that's you know uh what's going on at uh nintendo uh is under oops sorry um

302
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,240
i'm having problems with my computer over here where did discord go okay there we go

303
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,800
okay um but uh another thing i wanted to say about this whole nintendo uh news is that nintendo did

304
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:23,080
comment on the situation um so nintendo said we are aware of the claim which was filed with the

305
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,600
national labor relations board by a contractor who has previously terminated for the disclosure

306
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:35,720
of confidential information and for no other reason but that see i kind of like i get what

307
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:42,440
nintendo's doing here and covering their butt but i kind of think that reason like they were watching

308
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,640
him and he said something to somebody and they just they jumped on it you know what i mean like

309
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,880
i i don't know this seems a little bit of a stretch to me but whatever i'm not i'm not there

310
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,720
i don't know the specifics whatever uh nintendo is not aware of any attempts to unionize or related

311
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,280
activity and intends to cooperate with the investigation conducted by the nlrb

312
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,040
nintendo is fully committed to providing a welcoming and supportive work environment for

313
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,800
all our employees and contractors we take matters of employment very seriously well then i would be

314
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,640
curious what they have to say about the twitter user i talked about as well and other former

315
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:24,120
employees whether they be full-time or contractor i've heard other stuff as well that wasn't posted

316
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:31,400
as publicly um that's rather interesting so uh you know it was really just a matter of time

317
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,080
before your fav in the industry had a good good look at it as well and so here's now you know

318
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,320
nintendo's turn to look at what are they doing right what are they doing wrong so interesting

319
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,840
anyhow let's move on and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week

320
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,480
in how was your gaming week dark soccer i know you were at disneyland but did you

321
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:01,240
fit in any uh video gaming in your week um yeah i mean i i streamed so i played dead by daylight

322
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:08,120
and i played second and said to three um i have four of the mana beasts down or whatever they're

323
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:15,320
calling them the the nevadons i think is what they're calling them i i just think of them as

324
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,800
the mana beast um so um halfway through them and then i think after that after the other four then

325
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:29,480
i have the last fight so and then i've beaten the game and i'm moving on to tear enigma probably

326
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:37,720
whoa yeah um and dead by daylight i'm kind of i don't know i just like i didn't have any

327
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,120
concentration yesterday so i was just sort of being you know whatever about the game

328
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:48,040
it's just sort of like i don't care all right they won yeah whatever okay good sure yeah you

329
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:55,400
can boop my demo dog i'm still going to tear you to pieces i actually played demo it was kind of

330
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,840
fun he's a cute puppy i i didn't i haven't touched it by daylight all week i don't know what it is

331
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,360
i'm not like consciously trying to avoid it or anything i just kind of feel like the game's in

332
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:11,080
a bit of a lull for me right now i still play regularly for consistency it's also like double

333
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:19,320
experience yeah i heard that was going on this weekend the eerie shards yeah but um um i'm still

334
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,360
i still have fun i get frustrated sometimes and yeah like fanara just said new rift comes out on

335
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,520
the 27th oh that's right it's a twins rift yeah twins and david maybe i'll log in for that yeah

336
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,760
yeah so i have to see if there's anything you know worthwhile in it that i want that would

337
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,040
make it worth paying for so i mean i like i who am i kidding i like all the cosmetics so

338
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,040
i already have enough of a what is the orange shards i forget what they're called the oric

339
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,120
cells that's it i have enough of those on my account to buy the rift i probably will whatever

340
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:56,760
who cares i've actually i once paid for a whole rift as in like paid to advance on it oh wow

341
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,680
okay and that was for all the pig stuff uh okay got it because i'm sorry i'm the pig mane

342
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:11,000
um but no other other than that uh those are you know that my my wordscapes i'm still kind

343
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:21,000
of addicted um didn't really do much else um yeah right just i didn't even play astro blasters

344
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,520
um my gaming week uh honestly not a lot of new stuff it's it's two of my standbys i played a

345
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,960
lot of both i played more no man's sky i actually was really good with my streaming this week i

346
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,360
you know ever since the move and my life getting you know the raid turned upside down yeah you're

347
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,320
welcome um it's since all that kind of turned things upside down um i've been getting back

348
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,120
into streaming more regularly so i stream monday tuesday wednesday and one other day whatever day

349
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,120
i rated you friday maybe so um yeah i've been streaming more it's weird um but i played no man

350
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,320
sky on monday and i think friday stream the night i rated you i think i was playing that too

351
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:05,880
um and uh yeah no man's sky i i beat expedition six so i cleared everything with that expedition

352
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,840
and as annoying as it was with the increased pirate raids i think it made me a better no man's

353
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,040
sky player for one it forced me to do an element of the game i don't normally you know pay attention

354
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,840
to which is the combat stuff i would actually say it's probably the easiest expedition well

355
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,440
the normandy one was probably the easiest and that was more because of the length it was designed to

356
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,120
only be like a two-week expedition so you had to beat it in like five hours of game time um so that

357
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,280
was probably the easiest one but i would say six was probably the second easiest one uh if you're

358
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,760
willing to do the combat fights now i know bobby's talked about this on his show he really does not

359
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,280
like to do the fighting he's more of a pacifist player and i get it like if you don't like to do

360
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,480
the combat this latest patch is kind of annoying because they added

361
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,480
more opportunities to get fights picked with you but another thing i learned is that you can pretty

362
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,280
much run away from anything as long as you don't engage if you keep running one direction long

363
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,840
enough or flying long enough in one direction you can get out of it without engaging it's just

364
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,440
annoying because you know like a lot of things no man's sky you're doing one thing and then squirrel

365
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,400
something else comes up uh that's just how the game goes but i enjoyed my experience in the

366
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,600
expedition so much that like friday i was just like you know what i want to continue in this

367
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,640
new game that i started because um i beat the beat the expedition like an hour into monday's stream

368
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,400
and it was the last day for twitch drops and twitch drops take about three hours so i was like

369
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,400
you know i'm gonna try to do a three hour stream let's just start a new game let's do a new game

370
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,640
with all these rewards i've been collecting through twitch drops and everything so i started

371
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,280
the game and then i kind of found like i was missing it i kind of want to play that game again

372
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:52,440
um so i did on friday and um advanced my game and i probably will stream that a couple more

373
00:31:52,440 --> 00:32:00,120
days this week so i just i like no man's sky is just a relaxing game and the nice thing about

374
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,880
streaming it is that you know enough especially with the twitch drops a lot more people were

375
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,880
coming into chat but even on friday when there were no drops you know some some of the peeps

376
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,000
that i've known for a long time thanks to olr and hanging in other communities just coming in just

377
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,120
chilling out hey what's up you know this game is still pretty but just talking about stuff while

378
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:26,440
i'm blasting rocks for dust so um yeah quest buster says i just found out that you can make

379
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,880
squadrons and have a wingman warp in when you get into a fight they're not that great but they give

380
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,240
the pirate something else to shoot at yes you don't really learn about that until the very end

381
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:44,280
of expedition six but as soon as you get your freighter which in the main story or any time

382
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:49,720
really it's in the game's code if you do five warps galaxy warps your fifth galaxy warp you

383
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,880
will always warp into a freighter fight if you kill the pirates which isn't that hard you the

384
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,960
freighter will invite you aboard and the captain will be like i'm sick of this why don't you take

385
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,240
my freighter and you can get the freighter the minute you get that you can unlock at one of the

386
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:11,400
panels squadron mates and they cost nanites like most things in the game does um but they're it's

387
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,360
pretty easy to recruit at least one and uh yeah they'll fight by your side in some of those battles

388
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,120
which is uh pretty nice so something to think about um anyway also i've been playing follow

389
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:28,840
fantasy 14 because i was sidetracked by no man's sky with the expedition that was timed over easter

390
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:36,120
weekend i um was neglecting the 6.1 patch in follow fantasy 14 which i finally caught up with this

391
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,840
week so i streamed on tuesday and wednesday night shane joined me we did some dungeons i've done

392
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,400
the new dungeon i did the new raid i didn't do that on stream i ended up doing that um like

393
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:51,720
yesterday saturday or something i don't remember uh so yeah so uh been enjoying the patch in 6.1

394
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,760
final fantasy i'm playing sage for the first time which is one of the new classes that came out with

395
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:03,000
endwalker and it's funny because i i played it for the very first time on stream on wednesday

396
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,200
and i think you hear me sitting there kind of going none of these words make sense none of this

397
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,880
thing makes sense none of but now that i've played it and i'm up to like level 76 now um i actually

398
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:19,000
really enjoy the rhythm of sage it's a very like fast pace there's always something going on type

399
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
of healer where you're doing damage and healing and barriering and so it's very like satisfying

400
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,080
when you do it well but it can be tricky to get the hang of it first but i'm enjoying my adventure

401
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,080
in sage right now in final fantasy and i'll probably take it to 90 honestly so that'll

402
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:40,120
probably be the next class i get to the end game i still have yet to look at the pvp in final fantasy

403
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,240
but that's kind of on like my list of things to do hopefully in this next week so that's pretty much

404
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,600
my gaming week uh mike deft in our chat talks about most of my gaming this week has been pokemon

405
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,640
either go or unite which some kirby thrown in there and that does remind me you know i don't

406
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:01,400
talk about the um gps games but i should because they do take a lot of my attention yesterday was

407
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,560
like niantic community day where they were doing stuff in all three games so pokemon go had the

408
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,200
stuff old debut and all that stuff in the shinies um and pikmin had a you know their community day

409
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:21,080
for tulips so i walked 17 000 steps yesterday because in the morning i was walking with my

410
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,520
pic my ingress friends although there was a thing going on in ingress but it was kind of like

411
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,720
very passive and not like so we we weren't even playing ingress we were doing pikmin and walking

412
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,720
that and i got like 9 000 steps just walking with my friends and then i went back to the i had to

413
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,560
pick up my sister at the airport i went back downtown after all that and i went out for

414
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,520
stuffle community day and walked another like 8 000 steps walking around the capital several times

415
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,560
so but i caught 19 shiny stuffles like it was again and i only blew i only bluetooth caught

416
00:35:53,560 --> 00:36:01,400
the whole time um it was one of those things where i was like i i after an hour and a half i was like

417
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:07,320
i don't need this many stuffles i have 19 what am i going to do with these uh i'm done i have

418
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:14,520
1200 candies i'm kind of done so but i had a very productive day so that was my like niantic day so

419
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,720
i always forget to talk about the gps games but i play plenty of those as well it's not always just

420
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:26,200
final fantasy and no man's sky whatever standbys i have also i played my burger time machine

421
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,960
a little bit today really yeah i was trying to see if i could get the if i could get cheddar

422
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,360
to be interested in it because smush really likes the light and the noise and i was trying to see if

423
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,880
i could get cheddar interested in it so i played it a little bit to get the noise and all that

424
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,360
he didn't care he didn't care so it's interesting how cats like different things that's for sure

425
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,320
yeah midna would rather just like sit at the at the glass door and just watch everything outside

426
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,360
you know cat tv no smush used to like get up on top of it and all that stuff too but now the

427
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,920
cheddar's here he's his pastime is very much watching and patrolling whatever cheddar does

428
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:08,520
so anyway all right let's get into some more video game headlines for this week i hope you all had a

429
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:14,520
good week uh whether it was you know playing video games uh or going to something like pax east was

430
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,520
this weekend um i know that was the first convention um in a long time for a lot of people

431
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:27,400
i also know pax east did hecka precautions uh with mandated vaccines and masking so hopefully

432
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,320
everything is okay i always think it's a good idea if you're going to go to a convention like

433
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,760
that or whatever at least take a rapid test honestly just take the the nose swab test from

434
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,400
uh a medical provider like three days don't do it the day after do it like three four days

435
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,920
after just to make sure i think it's just always a good idea um i plan on going to dragon con over

436
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,400
labor day i'm sure there will be precautions that's fine and i will take a test as soon as i

437
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,200
get back just just to make sure just to be thorough but the reality is in this day and age

438
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,000
you go anywhere with a lot of people covet's going to be there somewhere you know you everybody

439
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,520
heard the story uninvited guest yeah everybody heard the story at gdc about the person who knew

440
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,960
they had covid and went to the industry parties anyway and that's just the reality is that's the

441
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,960
grocery store that's transit that's the airport that's a restaurant that is anywhere a lot of

442
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,800
people hang out somebody is going to go full well knowing that they have covid so if you're going

443
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,760
to be in close proximity with people in any of those situations look out for yourself you know

444
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:34,040
just unless unless you truly don't care then i hope you have a speedy recovery that's that's uh

445
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:42,200
like those people yeah it's that's all i got so all right moving on let's talk about in games

446
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:50,600
uh headline from ubisoft you know ubisoft not only in the working conditions uh environment but in the

447
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:56,040
nft's environment has been in headlines a lot lately which makes this headline very

448
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:03,400
interesting about a new project they are working on called project q and a tweet for ubisoft wrote

449
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:11,160
introducing code name project q a team battle arena letting players truly own the experience

450
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,880
the game is an early development and we will keep testing so for now all you can do is register for

451
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:22,120
upcoming tests well you see they kind of were forced their hand on sharing this because a

452
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:28,840
leaker out there actually shared footage of the game uh saying that it looked a little bit like

453
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:34,200
overwatch meets fortnite uh it's kind of what it looked like there was a mode called showdown where

454
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,800
four teams of two go against one another to decide the winner and battle zone sees two teams of four

455
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,680
going against each other to see who gets 100 points first but even though folks are saying

456
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,480
oh it's overwatch meets fortnite ubisoft was quick to say this isn't a battle royale game

457
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,080
which is so it's interesting to see ubisoft saying no it's not that not that by the way this

458
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:01,560
is not a battle royale the game will feature a variety of pvp modes with one single goal in mind

459
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,280
fun fun is the goal

460
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:14,520
yeah i like fun too we'll see we'll see if it passes the the rob roberts and dark sakura fun

461
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,680
test to be determined at a later date um also and i what also kind of cracks me up about this

462
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:29,800
ubisoft also went to say there are no nfts in project q um because selling point ubisoft has

463
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,280
been known to promote well it also goes to show what a big company ubisoft is you have different

464
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,240
developers within ubisoft so i think this team is probably trying to separate itself from some

465
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,520
of the other things ubisoft is known for which i think is very interesting so uh again if you want

466
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:51,800
to what was that oh i said let's hope yeah if you want to uh sign up to uh check out project q you

467
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:59,000
can do that over at register.ubisoft.com slash project q dash sign up uh and uh the project is

468
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:06,680
coming out for xbox one xbox series playstation four and five and pc uh let's hope this one lasts

469
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:13,880
and uh doesn't go the way of hyperscape which was a battle royale but apparently was not fun for

470
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:20,040
enough people because uh nobody was playing it and so they shut it down or they're shutting it down

471
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:28,440
but it is uh being uh and dated uh orange right is awarding one pat on the back for no nfts um

472
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:36,840
s2100 matt says letting us know there are no nfts gets one clap fifth fifth dream says a loud one

473
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:44,120
just sort of like a bad muted one like a like a golf clap no it was like this oh the hands just

474
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,920
there was an attempt at clapping um fifth dream in chat says pick a pick a better letter ubi

475
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,960
what's wrong with q what's what's your hatred with the letter q fifth dream

476
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,160
q's probably an amazing character i was just gonna say q's my favorite character and bond

477
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,440
what's wrong with that i i was actually talking about star trek oh that too star trek too

478
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,880
yeah let's remember some famous cues in history

479
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,600
anyway all right let's move on to our next story dark sakura what do you have for us next

480
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:28,840
well nintendo is doing something ahead of schedule um you know we often hear about like games being

481
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:37,400
delayed but we rarely hear about them coming out early and it looks that uh zenoblade chronicles

482
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,760
3 um is actually coming out two months ahead of schedule on july 29th um but it looks like that

483
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:51,080
instead of using whatever that early finish time you know to do more play testing and a

484
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:57,000
little bit more work on it they're just bringing it out so who knows what that's gonna mean but

485
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,960
we it's not like we haven't had games released early before uh like the upcoming game uh well

486
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,440
not upcoming it's already out but the sifu that came out um it was due february 22nd it came out

487
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,160
on february 8th and assassins creed 4 dropped early as well so it's not like we haven't had

488
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:26,760
a few come out earlier but i still think that the date should be maintained so that

489
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,120
again they can make sure that they have a good product here's why i'm gonna tell you 100 why

490
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,680
because it relates to something bobby blackwolf said they bobby blackwolf in our chat says they

491
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,920
probably have another game that will come out when xc3 was originally going to come out so they

492
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:47,960
rearrange things also in the news this week splatoon 3 which hadn't been dated yet but was

493
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:55,400
generally considered to be a summer game was given a date 9 9 2022 so it's going to get the dreamcast

494
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,000
day of 9 9 so that's getting a september release they're calling it a summer release because

495
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,360
technically you know summer runs through september 21st right so it's a summer release but it's it's

496
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:13,320
september summer so um that comment from bobby i think is 100 on the nose splatoon ended up taking

497
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:19,000
this i think i think splatoon got delayed but since they never said it was going to come out

498
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,240
on a certain day it's not a delay but i think the fact they're rearranging the calendar i think

499
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,320
goes to show that splatoon was probably originally going to be the july game

500
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,640
and ended up getting pushed back to september which you know if it needs more time than fine

501
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:40,040
whatever i think but it's it also interesting i just think xc3 has probably been done it's

502
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,680
probably been done and they're they're in the final stages of it and it was completely about

503
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:49,960
release strategy going into the holiday season and all of that absolutely but um

504
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,400
especially when it was already out there that xc2 and three were in development side by side so

505
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,840
three's probably been done for a few months now and it's really just a release release strategy

506
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,960
thing at this point and so now they don't want to compete against themselves although splatoon and

507
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,880
xenoblade are very different genres you're still asking nintendo fans who are probably interested

508
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,160
in both to plunk down 60 and another 60 so it's best if they space them out a little bit so that

509
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,960
they space them out a little bit so that you you know you'll pay 60 in july and then 60 in

510
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:28,680
september um on a somewhat related note i thought it was very interesting you know uh it was there

511
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,920
was a tweet going around earlier today that came across my timeline and it didn't make me stop and

512
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,840
go that is interesting that we're talking about xenoblade chronicles 3 being a tent pole release

513
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:46,920
essentially for the switch at this point right do you remember folks think back think back about 10

514
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,720
a little more think back to the wii era like 2008 2009 do you remember the first xenoblade chronicles

515
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:03,640
game and how nintendo wouldn't put it out in america and yeah how it took a little operation

516
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,800
rainfall to finally get that game to get released uh along with some other there were some other

517
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,880
games involved with that as well um but that game finally got released it was a gamestop exclusive

518
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:22,120
which i still to this day say was garbage but whatever at least it was released um and you know

519
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,160
because many people were just pirating it at that point i may or may not be one of them but that

520
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,280
game was so good uh at least it finally got in front of the eyes of other people and it's just

521
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,960
interesting to me how far we've come because since then then we had xenoblades chronicles x

522
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:43,160
on the wii u which you know it was wii u but i think it was still very well received as a wii u

523
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:50,120
title um and then of course the remaster came out for the switch and i i believe it did pretty well

524
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,520
uh well enough anyway to necessitate xenoblade chronicles two and three now so this is very

525
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:03,000
interesting that like this series is causing release strategy shifts in the u.s when nintendo

526
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,520
didn't even want to do this game in the u.s originally so can all of the supporters of

527
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:15,240
operation rainfall please just take a moment to say we were right and doesn't that feel good

528
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:22,360
doesn't that feel good uh bobby blackwolf says the lost story was the other one i think yes

529
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:27,480
there was that there was one other pandora something was the other there was one other

530
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,360
uh there was because there were three and they all did get released eventually um yeah so yeah

531
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:37,480
it was uh pandora's tower thank you orange right that was the other one so um they all did of

532
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:43,080
course the other two i don't think ever did get follow-ups uh was lost story a mistwalker title

533
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,680
there was it was from a studio everybody wanted to play it because it was from a particular studio

534
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,800
um but it never ended up yeah it was mistwalker so mistwalker kind of went a different direction and

535
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:02,280
now um fantasion is the most recent thing they've done right so um yeah so uh but last story i i kind

536
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:07,400
of Asian is great just you know annoying i wish they would revisit some of these you know it's

537
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:14,200
such a fascinating studio because they keep doing these rpgs that just don't stick for whatever

538
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:20,280
reason that's not i'm not talking about fantasion i'm talking about before that blue dragon i lost

539
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:27,720
odyssey so kind of turned a little bit weird did it yeah the thing the thing is is that like

540
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,440
playing through the game is easy the boss battles are harder than the advertised level

541
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,520
hmm uh and bobby blackwolf says it was the last story not the lost story you're probably mind

542
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,400
melding with lost odyssey which was also a mistwalker title it happens that was ways back

543
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,480
anyway i'm sorry i just had to point that out as i was like here we are talking about release date

544
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:52,360
strategies around zw a chronicles 3 when nintendo didn't even want to release the first one in the

545
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:59,000
us so i just think how far we've come and kudos to the fans for speaking up you know as much as we

546
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:05,400
talk about you know angry fanboys when it comes to nintendo i think operation rainfall did did

547
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,920
it appropriately and look at the look at the big victory here all these years later now we just

548
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,240
need the xenoblade chronicles x re-release on switch because a lot of people missed it on weu

549
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:24,040
and it had great music all right anyhow when before xenogears came out that they had a mention

550
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:30,280
of it in final fantasy 7 and no one got it because of how they spelled it right it was

551
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:37,000
when cloud was in the the wheelchair and not himself and one of the things he would mumble

552
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:47,880
was xenogias which is a literal romanization of how it would be spelled in katakana i love when

553
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,880
games subtly reference each other i love it it's like this little inside joke that only we get

554
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,320
i also i also love the concept of video games being set in like the same universe

555
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,040
evil is in final fantasy i love the concept of like tactics and final fantasy 12 and in my brain

556
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:13,400
in my head canon and i know i know yoshi p has come out and said no but in my head canon final

557
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:20,600
fantasy 14 is an evil is game um and i i i realize there are elements about the story that definitely

558
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:26,120
differentiate it from evil is but i it's it's uh it's an evil is in a different part of the

559
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:32,440
multiverse game to me and i think i think 16 will be an evil is game too to be quite honest i just

560
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,440
don't think that's been confirmed yet but that's that's maybe wishful thinking on my part but it

561
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,480
is creative unit 3 doing it and it's those are a lot of the people that worked on those games

562
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:47,800
so i think uh i think there's a strong chance 16 is an evil is game and i hope so so all right

563
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:57,800
moving on speaking of great things from the past dark soccer well um oh am i i'm sorry am i next

564
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,840
oh my bad i'm sorry you see you see what happens we lose one person for the night and the entire

565
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,720
rotation gets screwed up well you still left him in in the show role for another segment

566
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,520
well you know things happen that's right you were on last week's show always a part of the

567
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,720
show yeah i was like you were in last week's show even though you're at disneyland so

568
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,920
all right let's talk about this instead let's talk about nintendo uh and the nintendo switch

569
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:27,960
online and uh there's been a leak of the nintendo switch online uh because it includes unreleased

570
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:36,040
nes games um this was apparently something that was leaked over to um because this has to do with

571
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:42,680
another thing i'm going to talk about here uh oh this doesn't have the piece on the um gameboy

572
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:48,040
advance part hold on sorry i was looking at a story that talked about the nes titles that

573
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:53,000
have been discovered in the emulator as well but it all started with a gameboy gameboy color game

574
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:00,360
boy advance switch online emulator pack uh that was originally posted to 4chan sigh but leaks

575
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:06,920
happened there uh four files popped up on there and some twitter users braved 4chan to get in

576
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:14,520
there and talk and like see what's there uh there was a uh 7z archive that had loose nca's it was a

577
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:20,280
gameboy emulator uh made by nerd it's nintendo's team that works on other classics for switch

578
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,520
online the gameboy advance emulator calls sloop um so now some folks are saying you know 4chan

579
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:32,040
it's got a hit and miss type of track record but the consensus right now is that this one's legit

580
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:37,720
because builds of three nintendo switch online apps they're usable and they're playable

581
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,920
and they're a source code that has identifying information from nintendo devs so all the signs

582
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:50,920
point to this is legit otherwise this wouldn't catch fire the way it did um so we have news

583
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:57,800
that a gameboy advance emulator is being worked on uh for the uh nintendo switch and there are

584
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,760
games like pokemon pinball that show up in the list uh which i think are things that i would

585
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,840
love to play all over again i checked something trying to follow back a link on one of those

586
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:17,240
tweets and the account is dead the account's gone oh really yeah the one who was talking about the

587
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:24,200
analog support and the helco emulator i wonder if there was an nda so because i wonder if nintendo

588
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,160
maybe tried to shut it down or something who knows so that account is gone i wonder if this

589
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:34,440
other one is anyway the other one is still there that's very interesting some sometimes people

590
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,560
don't like the attention either and they might have changed their name to break all the links

591
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:43,720
or something i don't know so anyway um but this doesn't mean that it's coming tomorrow it doesn't

592
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:49,800
mean it's coming in june even it does it just means nintendo's working on it um but that could

593
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:58,200
be working out in the way future i thought it showed interesting things about um uh like how

594
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:04,440
they use save states to really practice some things in emulators and they actually had save

595
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,320
states that talked about like you know there's a certain texture used in this part of the game

596
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,960
and that they'll use those to test certain part of the emulators and that kind of made me click

597
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:22,040
and go aha that's where those sp releases are coming from you know how on the nso they

598
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:28,200
apparently like you know every other month or so they'll release like a kid Icarus sp edition

599
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,000
and all it is is basically a safe state that takes you directly to the last level in the game

600
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,680
so you can see how the very last level in kid Icarus is nothing like the rest of the game

601
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:43,880
it's it's very unique i i feel like those safe states some of them are just becoming the sp

602
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:49,320
edition of the game um or uh the other one that comes to mind it was one of the first ones they

603
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:54,840
ever did it was the legend of zelda um i don't remember what they called it but it was the money

604
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:01,720
filled edition it already had like every item 255 rupees it had like everything already unlocked and

605
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,720
i was like that was just a safe state for nintendo to test things in that game that's what that was

606
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:13,960
then they ended up releasing it as like a bonus game that's clever anyway the leak didn't just

607
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:20,040
leak that this gameboy advance uh emulators being worked on is that there was also unreleased nes

608
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:28,760
games including pac-man tetris galaga mega man castlevania lots of games that make you go wow

609
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:35,240
this really is missing it's also interesting to note the build date for the application october

610
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:45,000
2019 so they've been on this for a minute uh-huh now of course just because now see here's where

611
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,360
my brain goes i don't think just because the games were in the emulator they were ever being planned

612
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:55,160
on coming out because that's a licensing thing especially because this has all these mega man

613
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:00,840
games in there well hello capcom released a mega man's collection for the switch already they don't

614
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,000
want to just give these games to nintendo for free unless i mean maybe they'll they'll get a

615
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,920
money sharing thing later on but they're probably holding out but my guess is nintendo was probably

616
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:17,000
internally testing these to test the emulator to make sure that it was still good in case either

617
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,040
these games were ever just gonna you know they get the deal inked out these games come out someday

618
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:29,320
or um and i think this is the case with xbox or emulation in general and i know we have an

619
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,920
emulation expert in our discord server and i may or may not get corrected but just following this

620
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:42,040
over the years when you get a certain thing in emulation to work it usually causes other similar

621
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,320
games to work for example in the nintendo universe you hear a lot about mappers right you get one

622
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:53,480
mapper carpetridge type to work it usually means others that also run on that mapper will also work

623
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:59,080
i say xbox because i think back to that story when remember when like barbie dream adventures

624
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:05,400
ended up becoming a backwards compatible xbox 360 title everybody was like why did microsoft waste

625
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:10,200
their fucking time making that barbie game backwards compatible and i've been saying since

626
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:16,280
the beginning they didn't it's just another game that we don't know of that they did want to get

627
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:22,760
backwards compatible ran on a very similar type of coding structure engine something that the barbie

628
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,800
game did and so you know look at look at other games of that developer or that publisher did

629
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:33,160
and whatever microsoft did to get that game running also made barbie work and so i think

630
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,800
and that's my long-winded way of saying these mega man games showing up in this emulator build

631
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:44,680
may not really be about mega man it's probably more about the emulator because i i again i don't

632
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:50,120
see what capcom has to gain when they're selling these games independently for their own money

633
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:56,520
to just say okay nsl go ahead and release them on your service until they're sure that they're not

634
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:01,640
going to make any more money off that game and nintendo opens up their wallet enough so what do

635
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:07,080
you want to bet if these mega man games do show up it's going to be on the plus service expansion

636
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,800
pack whatever the fuck they call it because they need that extra money so that they can funnel some

637
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:19,800
of it over to capcom tetris i'm sure is a legal issue at this point um can they re-release the

638
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:25,720
old tetris i'm sure it's complicated granted they have tetris 99 but tetris 99 and the original

639
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,920
tetris on india they are different games and legally have to be treated differently

640
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,960
castlevania and simon's quest same logic why would konami just suddenly open those

641
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,400
up on nintendo switch online when they're trying to sell you the castlevania collection

642
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:50,920
so i i think some blogs and some people on twitter are reading too much into this and i

643
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:57,960
think maybe need to take a step back and go oh this is just more about testing the emulator or

644
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:03,400
maybe these games are ready to come out as soon as the deal gets inked legally but i don't know

645
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:10,680
if it will ever get inked legally pac-man um i hate to sound like a broken record but like

646
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,720
literally in the next two weeks there's a pac-man museum game coming out why does why does namco

647
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:22,360
want to put pac-man out on nso why they're trying to sell pac-man museum now i do look

648
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:27,720
at other games in here like kung fu the original kung fu on the nes which was an arcade game as

649
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:36,600
well i'm not sure why that game can't be released unless like was there an actual tie-in to

650
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:43,160
something that i'm just missing in the moment with that game legally but yeah that's interesting

651
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:49,640
i actually love that game by the way they must have some reasons yeah so i mean they

652
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,880
there's they don't have to tell us what the reasons are that's just the thing they don't

653
00:59:53,880 --> 01:00:00,680
have to tell us but it's interesting the more people speculate on it that just generates more

654
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:06,680
publicity for them oh sure sure uh now this is interesting over in chat ah thank thank you

655
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:12,760
orange right kung fu was based on an iram arcade game kung fu master ding ding that's it that's

656
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:17,800
why it's legally still tied up i remember the arcade game being awesome and then they they

657
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:23,160
ported it pretty well to the nes so thank you everybody uh and dgrms says iram is too busy

658
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:33,480
milking r-type to deal with kung fu well yeah how many r-type finals have we um s2100 matt says i

659
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,120
remember when folks hacked the playstation classic and folks saw that they had tested a ton of other

660
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:42,600
games on it including anime fighting games the whole list of games they used to test on it would

661
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:48,360
have made that thing better than a dust collector for sure uh fifth dream in chat says maybe that

662
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:55,400
contract worker at nintendo from earlier leaked the emulators i don't think the contractor would

663
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:03,400
have access to those files but it's it's cute fanfic but probably not rooted in reality i'm

664
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:10,360
sorry to say yeah all right uh let's go on to our next story now we can go to dark sakura's story

665
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:19,880
so um well activision blizzard is doing something right um i mean then again they're kind of having

666
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:30,040
to do it they have to yeah yeah um so they are adding two uh women senior executives to the

667
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:40,200
board um they are announcing that uh lulu cheng miss messervay i guess that's how it's pronounced

668
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:46,360
is uh joining immediately and then they're nominating carrie kar for election in their

669
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:53,240
annual meeting in june um which so far they've actually uh activision blizzard has been in

670
01:01:53,240 --> 01:02:00,120
violation of law that requires uh publicly traded companies with six or more people on the board

671
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:08,120
to have at least three women directors um and then half of activision's 10 person board has been

672
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:15,400
together for nearly uh two decades um eight men and two women currently sit on the board

673
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:25,160
um two however uh hendrick hart hartung the third and casey washerman have chosen not to go for

674
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:38,840
re-election so um so uh messervay is uh the vp of communication at substack and car is uh svp with

675
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:46,760
bacardi and an alum of the walt disney company so interesting there you go well the representation

676
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:51,240
is important it's interesting that there's you know the law and all that as well with the board

677
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:57,640
that's that's pretty neat um so it's good but um also i hope i hope these folks have been vetted

678
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:02,520
um because that's still important as well because the next story we have is about an executive who

679
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:08,600
is a woman who um maybe i don't allegedly not so great i don't know i've heard a lot of things

680
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:13,960
about this woman uh and she's on facebooks i actually have one more little thing to add on

681
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:19,160
please please if you don't mind yeah of course the soc investment group is actually urging investors

682
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:28,040
to vote against uh the activision blizzard acquisition the merger so um they own a small

683
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:35,560
percentage of activision stock um and they are calling for them to elect a new competent and

684
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:41,240
dedicated board of directors that's my quote um before it's going to go through and so i think

685
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:48,760
that this might be part of that this was announced uh last week i have heard of them going that in

686
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,880
there yeah no that's perfect i've heard of a lot of pushback to bobby kotex payout too you know

687
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:59,400
a lot of senators were voicing their opinions on that as well as that uh the deal shouldn't go

688
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,680
through because of bobby kotex payout his ass needs to be kicked to the curb paid out in rotten

689
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:11,160
prunes he needs to be paid out in a pink slip in a cardboard box like his contractors have he

690
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:16,840
should be given a bunch of prunes and be forced to eat it before he leaves well wait until you

691
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:23,880
hear what i have next dark sakura because it involves the tale of bobby kotek and the coo

692
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:32,520
or chief operating officer of facebook excuse me meta cheryl sandberg that's who i was referencing

693
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:42,200
a moment ago meta is under an investigation if cheryl sandberg broke company rules by um act by

694
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:48,760
uh basically trying to do a favor for activision ceo bobby kotek who she was dating at the time

695
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:57,160
oh how the world fuck i mean i just these bobby kotex stories anyone want to date him other than

696
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:02,280
maybe having him be a sugar daddy but she would have she would have enough money yeah like she's

697
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:10,760
i'm exhausted even just after the first sentence of this article but let me continue

698
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:18,440
according to a report in the wall street journal who keeps breaking these stories that going on

699
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,080
in the game industry so snaps and actual claps to the wall street journal and journalists who

700
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:27,160
are getting getting it fucking done uh when it comes to holding these companies accountable

701
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,640
uh according to this report so i have to say allegedly bold underlying italicize but according

702
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:39,160
to the report cheryl sandberg used company resources to kill negative reporting about

703
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:45,560
kotek so due to this meta is conducting a review and whether she violated the company's rules

704
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:51,480
the british tabloid mail online was pursuing is that the daily fail it must be it must be

705
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:56,280
the daily fails online the daily actually yeah the daily mail um yeah everybody calls it the

706
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,440
daily fail they're listed by by that name so the daily fail was working on a story

707
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:09,560
uh based on allegations from a former girlfriend of bobby kotex and a temporary restraining order

708
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:16,440
that she got against him but cheryl sandberg and kotek worked together in 2016 and 2019 according

709
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:23,800
to this report to strategize on how to persuade the daily mail to not report on the restraining

710
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:30,280
order facebook and activision staff were both directly involved with this and the concern at

711
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:35,560
facebook was that the story would quote reflect negatively on her reputation as an advocate for

712
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:41,400
women because remember she's dating him at the time wall street she's really an advocate for

713
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:50,280
women she wouldn't have been dating the shit yes i don't know what else to say uh the wall

714
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:56,280
street journal also openly questions if sandberg inappropriately used her influence as facebook

715
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:04,440
coo in dealing with mail online's management an unnamed source told that or said that kotek

716
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:11,080
quote told people that miss sandberg threatened the mail in 2016 by saying that such an article

717
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:16,360
published could damage the news organization's business relationship with facebook

718
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:24,760
why is the daily mail called the daily fail because of all their fucking clickbait headlines

719
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:30,120
and clickbait articles that they write on a regular basis who is the number one peddler

720
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:37,880
of those headlines but they do have a big readership oh sure people and people believe

721
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:42,120
stupid tabloids people especially if there's a grain of truth in it are you telling me dark

722
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:47,720
sakura here on this day on episode 911 of orange luxury are you telling me

723
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,440
that stupid people click stupid links are you telling me

724
01:07:52,760 --> 01:08:01,000
my point is that if they have a concern about this affecting public opinion of the piece of shit

725
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:07,880
and her association with the piece of shit then it's a valid concern i mean they're both pieces

726
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:14,680
of shit but now more people will know how much shitty they are uh pele hanumea and chat says

727
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:19,720
bat boy marries princess diana that's the daily mail no that was weekly world news i'm almost

728
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:27,400
positive daily mail will post like legit stuff every so often what does it what does it say

729
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:33,160
what does it say about my sad brain that i knew which tabloid it was and to correct this

730
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:41,800
well-intentioned listener on their comment i have i will be taking no i have no further comment at

731
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:49,640
this time let's go back to uh uh this saga going on over here it should be pointed out the mail

732
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:57,240
online never published its story on kotak uh a meta spokesperson denied that sandberg threatened

733
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:01,560
uh mail online saying cheryl sandberg never threatened the mail online's business relationship

734
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,600
with facebook in order to influence an editorial decision this story attempts to make connections

735
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:11,240
that don't exist uh bobby kotak said to the journal he never said anything like that

736
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:19,160
activisions board of directors said it did a thorough investigation into an incident in 2014

737
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:25,640
and that they have full confidence in mr kotak's leadership holy shit is that a lot to unpack

738
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:38,120
right there because um i mean how many times has the activision board of directors come to say

739
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:43,000
we have confidence in bobby kotak we have confidence in what's going on here when

740
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,800
when honestly truly there is no reason to have that type of trust in bobby kotak

741
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:56,040
they did a thorough investigation in 2014 what can you detail for me activision what that

742
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,240
investigation was because it sounds like that investigation was throwing it a deep doc drawer

743
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,240
locking it and throwing away the key

744
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:11,640
if you would care to hear another quote boy do i have one for you the board has been aware of the

745
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,480
circumstances reporting involving an incident in 2014 around the time of the incident in 2014

746
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:22,760
mr kotak notified the senior independent director of the board has subsequently updated the full

747
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,720
board and has been fully transparent with the board the board through its council scadden arps

748
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,760
has done a thorough and what a name i'm probably mispronouncing it but do i really care at this

749
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,400
point has done a thorough examination of the facts and circumstances of the event satisfied

750
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,880
itself that there was no merit to the allegations and notes that they concern a personal relationship

751
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:47,160
that has nothing to do with the business of the company the board continues to have full confidence

752
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:53,640
in mr kotak's leadership and his ability to run the company i'm exhausted

753
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:04,040
anyway uh before we get to our next story i see the raid there from bromigos so i want to say

754
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:09,160
thank you thank you for that usually uh we're recording a podcast and so we sometimes are

755
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:13,080
really bad about doing the twitch things of acknowledging all the things when they happen

756
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,840
because our podcast listeners can't see that or any of that but i do want to say thank you thank

757
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:22,120
you for that it is appreciated and hope you guys are having a wonderful night um hi and welcome to

758
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:28,840
orange launch radio we've been doing this far too long uh if i had justice the scrolls on the bottom

759
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,880
our first episode was back in 2002 so i want to thank you all for being here for um our episode

760
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:39,320
tonight uh dark sakura and myself here loki with the night off as he had just had surgery earlier

761
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:45,400
this week and is recovering uh let's get into some more stories uh especially after that last story

762
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:53,720
about really it's it's honestly it's rich executives scratching each other on the back

763
01:11:53,720 --> 01:12:00,760
literally and figuratively in this particular case and it just it's just exhausting to hear about

764
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:08,280
and why mr kotak is still employed in this industry i will never understand never understand

765
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:14,920
i i hope that once he's out the door that that's the last we hear of him

766
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:20,280
i hope that door gives him a swallow a solid thwack in the buttocks on his way out

767
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:28,280
all right let's i need happy news dark sakura make me happy make me happy only you can make

768
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:37,960
yourself happy rob is it the same anyway um sega is doing something cool they are uh doing reboots

769
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:46,040
of crazy taxi and just their radio and it's going to be big budget stuff too they are uh

770
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:54,440
the projects are part of something called super game initiative it's a plan that sega sammy has

771
01:12:54,440 --> 01:13:01,720
had since last year so they wanted uh the the quote is um they want to develop all new and

772
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:07,160
innovative titles with a focus on global reach online interactivity community building and ip

773
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:15,240
utilization um and that's where the working with microsoft for the azure cloud platform comes in

774
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:23,720
so they want to uh use some of its dormant ip's for remakes remasters and reboots and by name

775
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:29,880
they said crazy taxi and jet set radio as candidates um other games on the list of space

776
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:39,640
channel 5 res panzer dragoon knight shinobi um virtue fighter and altered beast yes to literally

777
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:46,920
everything on this list literally everything crazy taxi and jet set radio were up on the top of the

778
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:55,320
list according to bloomberg um they have um done remasters remakes things for other dreamcast era

779
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:01,720
properties um crazy taxi and jet set radio were on the sega 2011 dreamcast collection

780
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:10,200
there were more i actually have crazy taxi for ipad which is actually not bad um uh there's also

781
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:17,400
uh crazy taxi ty tycoon which was originally called uh crazy taxi gazillionaire which is a

782
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:24,840
business management sim slash idol game um they've outsourced a lot of their ip revivals though

783
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:31,080
including streets of rage 4 panzer dragoon remake alex kid miracle world dx and house of the dead

784
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:37,880
remake to indie developers so we'll see what happens but right now sega is kind of riding

785
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:47,320
high on the the sonic revenue and um they're also looking into adapting uh yakuza and streets of

786
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:54,920
rage so we'll see how that goes i want a streets of rage music uh the movie if the soundtrack is

787
01:14:54,920 --> 01:15:01,880
done by yuzo koshido well you may be in luck uh elsewhere in the industry this week apparently

788
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:06,600
this i i swear i read this somewhere the sonic director is interested in streets of rage

789
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:14,200
so but i knew about that yeah so but because i i actually brought that up two weeks ago oh okay uh

790
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:19,480
yuzo koshiro said somewhere that he wanted to be involved that doesn't mean his phone's ringing yet

791
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:25,720
yeah i hadn't seen anything about about that but i mean could you imagine if he did

792
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:33,640
like modern mixes of the original music that would be rad um in our chat they're talking

793
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:39,480
about like crazy taxi and these remixes um dark tetsuya says i saw someone on twitter

794
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:45,080
suggests a battle royale style take on crazy taxi and it sounds ridiculous enough to be fun

795
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:51,240
i actually think that would be awesome um like not necessarily 100 people but just even like that

796
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:56,680
sense of like 10 people all playing on the same map at the same time trying to pick up the same

797
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:01,240
people and get to the same spots i think that actually would be really funny that sounds really

798
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:08,600
funny it's only fun to me really i think it'd be fun i don't like i i i wouldn't like that i

799
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:14,200
like to get in and play it solo and be done it's it's always a solo game well it's not always be

800
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:22,120
as an option maybe i don't even i know but i when they when they put options in games like that

801
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:30,520
they have some sort of reward that forces you to play it and no um i also think um

802
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:37,960
crazy taxi is not crazy taxi uh unless it has that offspring song in it because only sometimes

803
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:43,080
they've been able to to get that you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like it's it's just not for

804
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:53,080
me it was more about the the um bad religion music i whenever 10 in 2010 came on that was my song

805
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,600
uh tiger cloud points out that whole soundtrack yeah sorry tiger points out it wasn't the sonic

806
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:04,200
director for streets of rage it was the writer for john wick my bad um the other one i wanted

807
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,600
to point out they were talking about panzer dragoon so quest buster says um as mike deaf

808
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:14,120
pointed out panzer dragoon had a remake unless they're talking about rebooting a new chapter

809
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:20,200
or the series which i'd love to see yeah i think that remake kind of had a soft land um it

810
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,800
definitely needed a patch to get to the place where it needed to be so i'm wondering if it

811
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:29,880
isn't maybe a new game or the reality is it's on the list but it's not at the top of the list

812
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:34,680
and you know at the top of the list they've already done that that third party remake yeah

813
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:40,840
as i mentioned so i i i would doubt very seriously i mean what i would actually like them to do

814
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:48,840
is if they did remake anything is if they did a remake of a panzer dragoon rpg or what was it

815
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:57,240
here panzer dragoon saga i think i i've got a copy somewhere all right um but that would be

816
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:01,800
nice because that game is is pretty amazing all right well let's talk about about what's excuse

817
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,160
me i have the hiccups you guys the worst thing that can happen to me when trying to do a show

818
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:12,360
um let's move on and talk about uh something that sega is doing which is sonic origins and we got

819
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:18,920
some new information on that this week so sonic origins uh is going to be coming to the the switch

820
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:23,320
but i believe it's coming to other platforms as well i just happen to be looking at a story on a

821
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:30,040
nintendo-based website um but it's a remastered collection of the original sonic the hedgehog

822
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:36,440
titles um so sonic did announce that the release date is june 23rd hey just in time for my birthday

823
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:42,440
and by the way it is the switch it's ps5 for xbox series and xbox one so it's you know most

824
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:48,840
of the normal areas you'd expect um sega's announced it's coming out on june 23rd and it's

825
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:56,760
going to be available in these different editions it's based basically standard digital deluxe and

826
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:04,680
three different dlcs with it which is uh yeah that's a lot it is a lot there's a start dash

827
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:10,840
pack uh with 100 bonus coins mirror mode already unlocked in a letterbox background there's a

828
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:17,560
premium fun pack with hard missions letterbox animations in the main menu and camera controls

829
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:23,320
in the main menu islands there is a classic music track with additional music tracks from

830
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:29,400
the mega drive and genesis titles so i i don't know if all this is really necessary um but okay

831
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:34,600
go off and honestly i'm gonna be honest when i first saw this trailer i was like

832
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:42,840
what these games have been released so many times they re-released rather so many times

833
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:49,320
you know we've had sonic one two and three and knuckles every more like since the playstation

834
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:56,520
3 xbox 360 there's been a sega collection that has had it in it i could swear sonic 3 has been in that

835
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:02,440
too but maybe maybe not the current like genesis emulation or whatever all right they're saying in

836
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:08,760
chat that sonic 3 has not been released in a long time i'll believe them that's fine but even then

837
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:16,680
it's you know just sonic 3 i guess sonic 1 and 2 of you'll come out a million times um some people

838
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,160
people also say it's because of the michael jackson involvement with the sonic 3 that that

839
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:28,680
one's kind of the the harder one to get re-done for whatever reason but it's not just and to be

840
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:34,280
fair it's not just that the games are re-releasing it's that they are done in the higher resolution

841
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:39,880
so it's you know crisp pixels i guess there is new opening and ending animations for each title

842
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:45,400
there are unlockables to get new content and special stages and then there's classic and

843
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:51,080
anniversary mode which basically the anniversary mode is a full screen so it uses wide screen

844
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:56,440
play the old games but in widescreen which is kind of interesting uh and as chat is pointing

845
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:02,440
out basically they're doing these games in the sonic mania engine which is interesting but i'm

846
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:09,880
not sure that dlc is a smart thing to do with this especially right out the gate to announce that all

847
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:13,880
this is there they probably should have released it and then trickled out the dlc probably would

848
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:18,760
have been a smarter way to do it but they really want to lock in those pre-orders that's for sure

849
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,120
so but i don't know i think i think they're asking a little much for it considering how many times

850
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:29,240
i've played played sonic the hedgehog in recent years but i do think that the widescreen mode

851
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:38,600
it's interesting but is it 30 interesting i don't know so all right well let's travel back and

852
01:21:38,600 --> 01:22:07,880
revisit a classic game in our next segment and dark sakura what did you pick for the classic

853
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:17,960
game tonight i picked tetranet yeah we've talked about it many many a time a lot of us have

854
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:25,240
memories of it well i'm bringing it up now tetranet um and tetranet i apologize i need

855
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:30,120
to step away for just one minute to deal with the hiccups i'll be back sorry all right tetranet is

856
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:40,200
an online multiplayer version of tetris that supports up to six people and has team play so

857
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:50,280
it first came out in 1997 it had releases for microsoft windows unix mac os 10 and bayos

858
01:22:51,240 --> 01:23:00,280
um it was developed by stormcat and the o is a zero because it was um the last official version

859
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:06,920
is version 1.13 and it was originally developed for windows and later ported to the other systems

860
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:15,720
stormcat also released tetranet 2 in 2000 that has improved graphics uh different types of special

861
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:22,600
blocks more types and additional features like a hold piece and block shadows and a master server

862
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:31,160
so um as far as um the game it basically is a standard multiplayer tetris with a twist

863
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:38,120
if you clear a row it will cause special blocks to appear in your field if a line containing a

864
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:46,120
special block is cleared then that block is added to your inventory clearing those lines at once

865
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:51,400
multiple lines at once increases the number of special blocks that you get so at any point you

866
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:58,360
can use a special block um at the at the start of your inventory on one of the six fields which is

867
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:06,200
one of your uh either your own or other people's uh or your opponents excuse me so it depends on

868
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:12,600
which type of block you're going to use so a is add a line where it adds a broken line

869
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:19,800
c is clear line which clears the line on the bottom of the field uh b is clear special blocks

870
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:25,880
which causes all special blocks to return to normal blocks r is random blocks clear so random

871
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:31,960
blocks are removed from the target field so that gives you gaps in your lines um o is a bomb block

872
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:41,320
which uh causes uh block bombs to explode and scatters uh other blocks throughout your play

873
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:48,600
field q is block quake which causes blocks on each line to shift and sort of like an earthquake

874
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:55,880
effect uh g is block gravity where the blocks on the field just immediately fall into whatever

875
01:24:55,880 --> 01:25:04,600
gap happens to be there and deletes the completed line um s is to switch fields so you actually

876
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,640
switch your play field with somebody else and n is nuke field which removes all blocks from the

877
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:15,320
target field the last player to still be able to place pieces in their field is the winner

878
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:20,600
um and depending on the server use there are alternate rules sometimes there is pure

879
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:25,560
where special blocks are disabled so it's just everyone is playing multiplayer tetris

880
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:33,320
and then seven tetris where the first player to make seven seven tetrises is the winner so

881
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:42,120
there are those modes um the music in this one um it it's it's called the dance of the spheres

882
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:48,200
it's been everywhere like they made a step mania chart for this um what i don't remember that

883
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:56,520
that's awesome yeah um it's the authorship is claimed by someone named uh david is it might be

884
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:04,200
although there are other sources that say davy m carlson is the composer um

885
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:11,160
back in the day we thought this was hot shit today i can't stand listening to it i mean i i was like

886
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:14,520
okay jamming for a little bit a little bit nostalgia then after i was like okay i'm done

887
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:23,480
um so there are also um different variables you can add to the tetranet uh 1.13 client

888
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:31,720
different variables um one is called tetra tetra fast which removes the one second delay between

889
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:39,720
the pieces that you find and the standard tetranet gameplay um after uh when the police

890
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:46,360
sorry police piece delay is implemented on the client side it's just a modification that keeps

891
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:54,360
clients from from having it happen to the you know you basically there's you only connect

892
01:26:54,360 --> 01:27:01,640
to people playing tetra fast um there's also uh one called tetranet slash tetra fast 1.14 with

893
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:07,880
the 1.14 protocol is a variant where everyone receives the same sequence of pieces there's

894
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:14,360
block tris um that's for the windows client um where it also supports the tetranet and tetra

895
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:22,120
fast protocols but it also has additional special block types one is for left gravity which pulls

896
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:27,800
the blocks to the left as far as possible piece change that changes your current piece and zebra

897
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:37,560
field which clears every second column on the field um then for tetranet 2 um it's another

898
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:43,800
multiplayer tetris done by the original creator um the five new blocks it adds is immunity where

899
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:51,000
the target cannot be affected by any special uh for 15 seconds clear column that deletes a column

900
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:58,840
from the field mutate pieces that causes um the target's next pieces a default of three to become

901
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:04,680
large and awkwardly shaped darkness where you can't see anything on the field beside your

902
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:10,040
current piece and its immediate surroundings for 10 seconds confusion that causes your controls to

903
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:18,200
get mixed up for 10 seconds um and then of course there were other other clone you know the other

904
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:26,360
uh tetranet 2 got closed down by the tetris company just like other ones did um the website

905
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:32,520
and servers were unavailable for several years as of early 2010 tetranet 2 is back up and running

906
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:43,000
uh and that's uh i kind of want to play yeah um the tetranet 2 website and servers have been

907
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:53,400
recovered relocated and restored um this the with all of the you know various versions it was really

908
01:28:53,400 --> 01:29:01,320
well received especially by the linux community the uh linux conference uh linux.com.au um even

909
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:07,960
had a programming contest where they tried to uh program tetranet playing bots that would connect

910
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:13,240
to the server and play the game and the prize for best spot was forty thousand australian

911
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:22,040
uh was sorry a forty thousand australian dollar ibm p-series server and there's also land parties

912
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:30,840
um game revolution said tetranet was an affordable alternative to tetris and then in a review in 1999

913
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:36,280
of the next tetris game revolution said that tetranet was truer to the tetris roots and if

914
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:41,480
you want multiplayer a multiplayer tetris the network-based tetranet is more fun

915
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,160
i'm wondering if the existence of tetranet is what led to tetris 99

916
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:54,920
oh i'm i'm sure it's in part inspired by it for sure absolutely yeah you know when they were

917
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:59,080
trying to think of like how do we do tetris as a battle royale somebody probably thought of

918
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:04,840
tetranet you know and and you know how could we model it after that in some capacity oh for sure

919
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:11,800
for sure really care by the way for the way that tetranet 2.0 looks yeah i like the way the first

920
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:22,120
one looks better yeah but i like the overlaying grid over the pieces so for people who have like

921
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:29,160
some issues with uh the perception of space and i'm not saying next necessarily depth perception

922
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:37,560
but just more like spatial awareness having the the segments to the blocks make it easier

923
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:43,880
and more accessible well we didn't uh in chat they're talking about a vog tetris night and

924
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:50,040
def says uh tetris 99 has private lobbies you know uh a tetranet or a tetris 99 i think i'd actually

925
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:55,320
like super be down for that i think that would be a lot of fun uh i think we should invite kevin ddr

926
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:00,280
uh from who used to listen to olr years ago to just come and slaughter us all

927
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:07,640
so if you don't know he's he's uh was quite memorable in the tetra scene for a while so

928
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:13,720
i don't know if he still plays regularly but yeah that would be very funny all right all right well

929
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:17,080
there it is uh i think that's all you have to say right that's your classic game of the week

930
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:22,520
tetranet that'll do it that'll do it but that's that's such a good pick i love i love tetranet

931
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:26,600
and you're right it's come up on the show i don't know how many times before so uh it only makes

932
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:32,520
sense we spotlight it as a classic game of the week eventually around these parts right so all

933
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:39,640
right um anyhow let's wonder why okay my discord was taking forever to kick back in jamie was a

934
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:45,320
gray square for a minute there all right that's right um a lot a lot of ellos i have more stuff

935
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:50,840
to do in a row so i'll get right into it are we really okay oh yeah it's rapid fire news hey

936
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:55,960
when loki's not about to eat myself some rose jelly bellies okay when loki's not here we all

937
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:00,280
got to pick up the slack but these are rapid fire news so you can talk about them rapidly well i'll

938
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:06,840
let you chew that jelly bean and just mention in chat lol lol and dark tissue says idk how badly

939
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:13,080
do you want to lose um excellent question i'll probably lose anyway i'm not that good at tetris

940
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:20,040
um you know another tetris game that isn't played online enough is tetris effect it had a pretty

941
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:23,160
neat multiplayer mode in it i don't know how many of you actually have it we should do a

942
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:29,640
tetris effect night one night that would be fun i think so all right um i still like giant tetris

943
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:36,040
which one the giant oh isn't that a sega machine the arcade i think it is yeah that's fun all

01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:41,400
ask me my opinion on things throughout the week i'm if i'm surprised people care but i'm surprised

963
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:46,680
or i'm always uh happy to drop my opinion on whatever you just tagged me over on our discord

964
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:51,640
server so um dart to see us says i never got around to that one officially i'm assuming that's

965
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:56,280
the battle toads and double dragon game but playing a bit of the rom it seemed kind of fun

966
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:01,880
yeah all right uh we are now going always annoyed the shit out of me so i'm not buying it

967

968
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:11,960
loki is not here tonight so i will take up the us release dates and talk about uh what is coming

969
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:20,280
out in the us so let's see today is the 24th so this week on the 26 demon gaze extra for windows

970
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:26,840
zombie army 4 dead war is coming out on the nintendo switch and then we've talked about

971
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:31,560
this on the show prior the stanley parable the ultra deluxe edition is out pretty much

972
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:37,160
everywhere uh vampire the masquerade blood hunt i know we've seen some previews of that uh that

973
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:43,160
is out on windows and playstation 5 so if that's up your alley you have that and then on the 28th

974
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:48,840
bug snacks uh makes its debut on the xbox platforms as well as windows and nintendo

975
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:55,000
switch so bug snacks is no longer a playstation exclusive as of the 28th for you cricket fans

976
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,960
out there cricket 22 is coming out on the nintendo switch but i'm just i'm just gonna guess

977
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:04,680
i don't it's listed in my american release dates although i can't imagine it's actually coming out

978
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:09,640
in america but that's that's awesome if it does there's a somewhat cricket falling in the us

979
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:13,640
that's true there's there's people who play rugby here too i know some gay rugby players

980
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:21,320
they love it rugby is is preferable i think uh then we have rogue legacy 2 i think that game's

981
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:26,040
been in early access for a little bit but it's coming out of early access for windows xbox uh

982
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:31,480
won an xbox series uh that is all on the 28th uh tasomachi behind the twilight for nintendo switch

983
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:38,680
and playstation 4 and uh quite a big release this week on april the 29th so uh just before we get to

984
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:47,320
our next show nintendo switch sports that is we sports but nintendo switch sports um and that's

985
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:51,400
uh one that we've had on our our ion for a little bit ever since nintendo kind of surprised announced

986
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:58,440
this but should it be a surprise should it because this is a we sports was a huge selling game

987
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:03,640
nintendo switch sports will have tennis bowling and sword play or chambara is what it's called

988
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:11,400
in the game and three new sports soccer volleyball and badminton so uh you can uh hit around the

989
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:16,280
shuttlecock in the privacy of your own home on nintendo switch sports i want to fence people as

990
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:20,280
you play badminton so enjoy playing with your shuttlecock that is what and if you didn't know

991
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:25,320
that is what they call the little thing in bat badminton it's the shuttlecock all right i think

992
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:30,280
all of us learned that in high school playing badminton all right moving on to japan and

993
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:36,440
checking out the japanese release dates looking on the nintendo switch uh pretty similar story uh we

994
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:46,920
have um ike men sengoku toki o kakaru koi aratanaru day uh comes out in regular and limited edition

995
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:54,520
from idea factory uh and that is uh where you are a fashion designer who goes back in time to

996
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:03,240
an alternate version of sengoku era japan you have accidentally changed history and earned the favor

997
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:09,480
of nobunaga oda by saving him from death so you must survive three months surrounded by famous

998
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:13,800
and handsome sengoku warlords before your next chance to make it back home

999
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:22,760
this game sounds too ridiculous to be true but it's true but it's but it's it's notable because

1000
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:30,760
it's you're it's like a men dating simulator you're dating uh sengoku so um that's kind of fun

1001
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:36,600
all right let's see what else uh food girls 2 civil war

1002

questions now um in the uk we only have four uh on the 26th for switch we have zombie army uh

1017
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:35,960
us in our discord for a call vog network.com discord by the way i i have a special need tonight

1018
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:41,160
i'm hoping somebody will call in because i'm gonna need help wrapping up the show tonight

1019
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:45,640
because dark sakura as you know she tends to go out the door before the credits roll because

1020
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:50,200
she's trying to set up for her own little thing uh going on after the show the after party

1021
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:57,960
that's going to leave me here all by my lonesome self so what you're what was you saying i was

1022
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:03,720
singing that song all by myself by myself yeah so that will leave me all by myself if nobody

1023
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:08,280
calls in tonight but if we get a phone call tonight i can let that person close down the

1024
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:15,480
show with me tonight so that'll be fun all right um but first intern yeah an intern tonight so

1025
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:20,440
let's uh we do have some stories to get to before we get to the listener round table so let's get to

1026
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:30,920
this uh first story from dark sakura so um uh wisconsin video game workers uh at raven software

1027
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:35,880
um as we know they are the arm of activision blizzard that works on call of duty

1028
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:45,080
um they and i believe that we've talked about raven before in this uh in this whole uh concept

1029
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:50,360
here but they have a unionization campaign by 21 of their employees in middleton wisconsin

1030
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,920
um as just trying to shake more of this up going on i mean they're working you know to really put

1031
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:06,280
it in there um but at this point um their regional uh nlrb director in minneapolis rejected

1032
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:14,040
um activision's push to have the election encompass a wider category of raven workers

1033
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:23,880
that would dilute the unionizing vote so um at this point um it looks like that the union

1034
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:25,480
the unionizing may be good to go

1035
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:34,280
so you know we we hypothesize this would probably start at activision and this would be one of the

1036
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:39,160
first to uh break the dam so to speak on the unionization in the game industry efforts and

1037
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:43,480
that might be uh coming to i mean we it's not the first time we've heard of the uni because we've

1038
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:47,800
had stories on the show weeks before there's been other smaller developers but for this to happen

1039
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:54,840
within activision would be something another thing too earlier this month um activision

1040
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:59,480
blizzard also announced that they would be converting nearly 1100 part-time quality

1041
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:06,440
assurance jobs to full-time jobs and raising hourly wages to at least 20 bucks so there's that

1042
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:12,440
all right and uh if you've gotten if you're getting a raise at your job and you want to

1043
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:18,280
waste your money on something uh boy do i have the prospect for you and that is more legos because

1044
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:27,480
an official lego atari 2600 is supposed to be launching this august um this is by promo bricks

1045
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:33,640
who kind of leaked this i guess um because uh this you know these things tend to leak out in catalogs

1046
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:40,200
and um you know uh industry ordering and things like that um so an official lego version of the

1047
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:46,920
2600 console uh will be coming back coming out in august as part of the 50th anniversary for

1048
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:53,880
atari as a company uh the set will have a lego rendition of the console itself and also the

1049
01:43:53,880 --> 01:44:00,360
joystick and a cartridge of pitfall which is interesting because that's not an atari game that

1050
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:05,080
was an activision game but that will be the game that will be made from plastic bricks of course

1051
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:11,480
very very similar to the nes system that's out there that you can make a little mario on the tv

1052
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:17,080
that runs it's super cute i don't have one because i was able to hold on to my money but i've seen it

1053
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:22,280
i think bobby blackwolf had one at his house and i was looking at it it's cute um and uh yeah it's

1054
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:28,840
a cute little system so uh that'll uh if the atari 2600 one has the tv and everything too that would

1055
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:37,800
be pretty cool so uh promo bricks is saying that the atari 2600 will be 200 i'm sorry 199.99 but

1056
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:44,360
let's just say 200 uh when it is a timed exclusive on lego's website this august and a general retail

1057
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:52,200
release in january of 2023 dark to see it says well i guess it would be either that et or pac-man

1058
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:56,120
uh i think atari wants to forget those two

1059
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:04,200
so it's probably yeah combat would have probably been the game for that oh hey loki's in chat

1060
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:09,560
shouldn't you be lucky shouldn't you be resting loki all right i knew he wouldn't be able to stay

1061
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:15,720
away all night but i was actually gonna say tune in next week to find out when loki plans to get

1062
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:20,920
his because i'm sure he's gonna get uh his own version of that but um i would also expect so so

1063
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:27,080
i also saw in chat uh they're saying that seems kind of cheap it says nothing about the operational

1064
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:32,840
tv with the game on it we know there's a pitfall cartridge that doesn't mean there's a pitfall game

1065
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:38,280
on the tv so i would imagine that piece of it probably actually isn't there um unless they you

1066
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:45,000
know unless again we're hearing this uh from a second-hand source i imagine when uh atari or

1067
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,240
excuse me lego and atari decide to officially unveil it we'll find out for sure but i wouldn't

1068
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:55,400
count on the tv being a part of it so all right that is it believe it or not for the stories that

1069
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:59,560
we had on deck for tonight so we're going to get into the listener round table we'll take your

1070
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:07,400
questions uh over at twitch.tv slash vog network but also we welcome your emails every week

1071
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:12,200
participate at orange lounge radio.com and as i mentioned earlier we will take your calls on the

1072
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:19,000
discord vognetwork.com slash discord i believe we have one email tonight so i will turn it

1073
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:25,080
over emails oh same person snap or i may have not thrown out last week's email check the date

1074
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:30,680
um you know i'm notoriously bad at that yeah yeah sorry last week that was last week's you know i

1075
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:39,480
rely on a clean inbox you are more than welcome to log in before sunday night to take a take a peek

1076
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:45,960
all right let's get to tonight's email hello lr i was not expecting the reaction that i got

1077
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:51,320
to my email last week ha as always thank you for your support of my games and i'm including

1078
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:58,440
the listeners in that as well rob mentioned that unlike with xbox live indie games falling plus is

1079
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:06,040
displayed on the proper xbox store unfortunately this isn't 100 true because although you can

1080
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:11,720
search for it and find it easily you cannot browse the store for it games included in the

1081
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:17,080
creators collection as it is called cannot be browsed you may recall that the store got a

1082
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:23,240
complete visual overhaul back in 2020 this collection had a browsable section on the store

1083
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:28,680
before that but now that is gone several folks have opened tickets or made complaints about this

1084
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:34,520
but unfortunately microsoft is not acknowledging or responding to these oh well i will also mention

1085
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:40,280
that falling plus is unfortunately not a play anywhere title meaning you cannot also play it

1086
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:47,080
on windows but if um if you buy it on xbox to anyone who would have utilized this i apologize

1087
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:51,080
but it's already available on steam and my audience is small enough that i didn't want

1088
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:57,560
to split it across the two different pc versions but if you post a score to leaderboards on xbox

1089
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:04,280
email me at yyr at yyrgames.com with your xbox gamer tag and they'll send you a free steam key

1090
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:09,400
that's good guy yyr he doesn't have to do that at all but that's just good guy yyr

1091
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:15,880
i'll end with a quick correction forza horizon 4 is actually still available on xbox game pass

1092
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:22,120
so if you just discovered forza horizon with the fifth game but would like to try the same game on

1093
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:28,040
a different map then give it a try while you can i happen to really like the version of the uk that

1094
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:32,920
they created thanks again for the show and have a great week looking forward to seeing peppy the

1095
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:40,440
penguin again erin yyr all right i'm i'm so glad uh you're happy with the reaction because i was

1096
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:45,880
happy to see it and that's a bummer that there isn't like a store like a way to like look it

1097
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:50,600
up in the store by hand you know a store page kind of like you were explaining there i just assumed

1098
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:55,800
because i could search for it and it had like you you were in the template in the store like you had

1099
01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:00,760
screenshots you had all that other stuff i just kind of assumed oh okay it's in the store because

1100
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:06,360
here it all is but you have to search for it that's interesting um ssj100 matt also notes uh

1101
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:10,520
you can link directly to it because he just dropped the link in our chat room so you can

1102
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:15,720
actually just tap the link and buy it there that way if you want um it's it's too long of a link

1103
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:21,240
for me to read on air so i can't really do it that way um but i can just say search for falling plus

1104
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:28,040
or you can probably search for yyr uh and you'll find it that way too but if for whatever reason

1105
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:32,120
that doesn't work dude just do falling plus and you'll find the game i did play it earlier this

1106
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:39,720
week but i i didn't i was playing for so long i got to a point i had to leave i had to leave and

1107
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:44,920
i couldn't finish the game and upload my high score i should have just purposely died a bunch

1108
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:48,680
of times to get my high score up there but i'll do that i'll do that later this week maybe i'll do

1109
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:55,400
a stream who knows but kudos again yyr for the release of falling plus and um my bad on forest

1110
01:49:55,400 --> 01:50:00,120
horizon four i guess it was three they must have delisted not that long ago i'm just getting lost

1111
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:06,440
amongst all those numbers can you blame me i'm not sure all right thank you dark soccer for that

1112
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:11,800
email reading uh participate at orange launch radio.com if you would like to send an email for

1113
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:17,880
a future week in the meantime let's welcome a special guest onto the show because i see

1114
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:22,120
someone in our green room so hello you are you are on orange launch radio who's this

1115
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:32,200
hey what's going on everyone it is ron well long time no talk i know right you know i had no i

1116
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:41,480
wasn't planning on calling in until that first article popped up i'm like yeah which article

1117
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:47,800
oh about about about the person working at nintendo that's oh basically mad they didn't

1118
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:54,920
get flipped to full-time employment what's your thoughts on that well i've been in it

1119
01:50:54,920 --> 01:51:02,760
basically 20 something oh yeah it and contractors oh yes yes and the bulk of that has basically has

1120
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:10,680
been me as a contractor and the main reason you want to go fte is for the benefits and the

1121
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:16,360
discounts and all that cool stuff that's the main reason why but sometimes you'll have to

1122
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:24,120
be there anywhere from like three days to five years until a position opens up that you can get

1123
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:31,400
in there or if the budget is big enough where oh they could add another spot for you and that's

1124
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:37,400
it and contracting specifically is a very interesting world because you get a lot of

1125
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:42,120
temporary people that are brought in for transition work like we're moving from one

1126
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:47,160
cloud to another so we're going to hire contractors that are experts in this to help us with this

1127
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:51,000
transition and then we're going to let them go because they're only they're literally contractors

1128
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:56,040
they're here for this length of time it does a lot of stuff like that that i i would say is

1129
01:51:56,040 --> 01:52:02,040
nefarious but it's oh it stinks and i'm sure i'm sure nefarious shit happens don't don't get me

1130
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:09,880
wrong yeah it basically depends on the company now i i will put this out there you know i

1131
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:18,200
was a contractor with nbc universal for about a year until covid happened now we had two separate

1132
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:23,480
it departments they merged them so the next open spot went to somebody in the other department

1133
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:28,920
because he had seniority over me and the main reason why i was putting my head down doing what

1134
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:34,200
i had to do is because i wanted those discounted tickets to universal studios and for the record

1135
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:38,280
i was going to universal studios japan so that was that was my main goal you got to see you

1136
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:42,680
got to see super mario world i don't blame you at all yeah that well yeah that and the sailor moon

1137
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:48,600
4d uh experience oh shit that's a thing oh my god i want to see i want to take alan alan loves

1138
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:54,520
yeah yeah i i will find you information and i'll send it to you do you know how many bootleg vhs

1139
01:52:54,520 --> 01:53:02,680
sailor moon tapes alan has in his closet i know i had over 150 bootleg vhs tapes until i had to

1140
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:08,520
toss them when i moved believe you me and when i switched to digital a couple terabytes of fan

1141
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:15,880
subs which i slowly deleted as i went to purchase legal titles and stuff like that but i've worked

1142
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:21,720
for a company called fresh direct where i was a contractor there and i ended up long term because

1143
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:27,800
i knew how to run help desk and do technical support besides loading windows or mac onto

1144
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:33,080
a computer and handing it to the user and what they did was they had a contracting division

1145
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:38,280
for those for union for the truckers you were contracting with them for x amount of weeks

1146
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:44,680
till you got flipped over to the union where you had all the benefits and so forth and one thing

1147
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:50,600
that some people don't realize is that when the company when the agency pays you x amount they

1148
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:56,360
charge that company double the amount to have you there which is why nine times out of ten you'll be

1149
01:53:56,360 --> 01:54:03,320
at that same rate for more than one or two years because they'll be like oh we don't have that type

1150
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:09,720
of money because it's coming out of their bonus and that's why you work hard to show it you can

1151
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:15,320
do so that the manager of this company be like you know what this person's good i like them

1152
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:23,080
let's convert them you know and right now the company i'm currently working with

1153
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:30,760
i got the call about a month ago saying that my contract is getting converted so i'm basically

1154
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:36,440
waiting for the hr paperwork and so forth so in a way i do understand where this person is coming

1155
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:44,120
from but sometimes you you've got to you always got to watch your back because even though you

1156
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:51,000
are still an employee of the company you got to follow the rules and so forth the littlest stuff

1157
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:58,520
they will ping you for and what's interesting in some cases the littlest stuff they don't they

1158
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:03,480
just let that slide and they expect everybody else to set the proper example you know

1159
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:11,080
it's uh the contracting world is very interesting stuff and it's it's it's far beyond video games as

1160
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:16,920
well but it's interesting to see um how video games kind of play into that and how the industry

1161
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:22,920
you know really uses contractors to do um a lot of work that we don't always think about that goes

1162
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:28,520
into making games i mean it's not even sorry it's not even just like the testing of games and these

1163
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:34,520
are that but like we've talked about trade shows packs right now i don't know what big names are

1164
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:40,440
still doing packs east right now um but you know when it was you know nintendo and sony that were

1165
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:46,440
doing these shows the booths that were the people that were staffing the boost contractors yeah

1166
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:54,360
booth babes i'm using my quotey fingers at e3 in the pat contractors yeah so i mean

1167
01:55:56,280 --> 01:56:02,920
and wait this happens at regular anime conventions too it's like you can be you go to a con and be

1168
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:08,440
like you can work a booth and get for 20 hours and get reimbursed for your badge and you still

1169
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:12,440
get to go enjoy something like that that happens yeah and the thing is it's like

1170
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:21,560
like nintendo can sit there and curate all these resumes and go through the whole kit and caboodle

1171
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:28,840
of the multi-tier interviews to see if they want you or not they'll let the third party company

1172
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:34,120
be like you know what we're gonna call all these people in they're gonna put them through those

1173
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:38,600
interviews it used to be where the agency will call you back we got your position you report

1174
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:44,360
here now it's like we have your position you're gonna interview with the agency to see if you are

1175
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:50,520
fit and if they like you you're going to interview with the company and so on and so forth that way

1176
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:55,080
in the event you do get converted to full-time you've already done those interviews all you

1177
01:56:55,080 --> 01:57:01,640
gotta do is sign the paperwork and that's that um speaking of conventions i know you were somewhere

1178
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:06,200
this weekend because you sent me a picture with another blast from olr's past where were you at

1179
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:13,480
this weekend i was actually in the bronx i went to go visit j j vmont at his job oh you were at

1180
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:18,680
the store oh i thought you were at a convention okay you were in the actual store oh okay no i'm

1181
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:23,960
i have a convention this weekend i'm still catching up from the last con uh i i pre-ordered

1182
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:31,560
a pop from his store because you know even though that same pot was available at game stop i decided

1183
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:36,440
to cancel that pre-order in order from his comic book shop to support small independent shops good

1184
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:42,920
for you especially especially his our old friend there so even if i haven't seen him in a while he

1185
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:47,080
used to call her right once in a while but i i know business has been very busy so i forget

1186
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:52,200
i went there to pick up a pop and he walked and he he walked away with a hundred extra dollars

1187
01:57:52,200 --> 01:58:01,320
of my money i bought comic book boxes and more pops okay aka shit you don't need you still

1188
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:09,560
walked out of there with it hey look today today was our weekly cost or no actually more

1189
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:15,480
our every three weeks or so costco trip i have no room to talk about buying extra shit you don't need

1190
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:24,920
look behind my head is a mini is a makeshift shelf that sits on my storage bins of all the

1191
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:31,080
figurines i have purchased that i have not taken out because i realized i don't have room for them

1192
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:38,600
in the display case but they're great deals at cons and it's like well it's within the seven

1193
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:45,880
to ten dollar amazon let me buy this you know i love it uh yeah i'll be filling up this place

1194
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:52,440
soon enough with that same stuff so yeah i'll say as much about one thing about contracting that i've

1195
01:58:52,440 --> 01:59:00,120
gained from is the fact that every place i've worked at is same yet different i've gained a

1196
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:07,240
lot of valuable knowledge and training and skill but what sucks is when you're trying to go full

1197
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:12,840
time somewhere they look at your resume and see all these places and it's like well how come you

1198
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:19,000
haven't stayed here how come you're like my contract ended that was it that's all it was

1199
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:24,840
yeah i was up for a role i didn't get it because i had too many contracting positions and in a way

1200
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:29,000
i'm kind of glad i didn't get that role because i'm happier where i am now that's a weird thing

1201
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:36,280
to dq someone over for sure the person believes that when you're in it you shouldn't have all

1202
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:43,800
these multiple positions these roles i i know multiple people in it where that's the norm

1203
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:47,960
couldn't you just list your role as the contractor company and the whole time you've been there or

1204
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:51,320
are you going back and forth between different contractor companies just because i know when

1205
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:56,040
i was like that by the way well when i was doing contract stuff i was signed up with like three of

1206
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:59,800
them and i'm like whichever of you hose gets me a job burst is the one i'm sticking with

1207
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:07,080
i i do that that's exactly what it is yeah i sent my my my resume out next thing you know i'm

1208
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:14,120
getting all these texts emails and phone calls you know yeah it's for sure i will put it this

1209
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:22,280
way though when i started with where i am i um i started there with the intention that they would

1210
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:27,560
hire me because that's just how it works if you really suck you don't you don't stay on

1211
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:32,920
and i had my first interview for a completely different department and where i work they

1212
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:38,360
encourage you to wear different hats and diversify yourself and build a bigger portfolio and learn

1213
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:44,360
more and incorporate that into newer and newer newer roles so i know that where i work is also

1214
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:50,280
a unicorn uh rama i want to get your reaction to this quote in our chat over at twitch.tv

1215
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:55,080
network quest buster says a co-worker once told me that you can't spell shit without it

1216
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:04,280
look there is a reason why there is a flask on my desk

1217
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:11,960
it's regularly have a gimlet lunch break

1218
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:19,880
i i'm glad that they care lunch for us every single day and i'm glad of the fact that the

1219
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:27,720
one block over sells beer okay i love it all right well uh hey rama why don't you hang out

1242
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:32,920
drink more sparkling water because this cherry limeade is the bomb that i i've had that

1243
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:40,840
particular brand and it is good it's good stuff there's like nine cases sitting over here so i'm

1244
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:45,720
like i'm good for the next like three months i'm not the only one that stocked up at costco clearly

1245
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:52,040
so all right anyway uh my final thought tonight is you know what i need costco to carry and i've

1246
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:55,560
already talked about this on a previous episode of the show is this fucking quote coke starlight

1247
02:03:55,560 --> 02:04:01,800
shit that's a zero it's so good i think so some people some people think it tastes like ass i

1248
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:09,560
think it's delicious and uh it was tasty i kind of felt a taste a hint of caramel while i was

1249
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:13,720
drinking i'm like it's lighter than normal coke this is good it tastes like raspberry to me it

1250
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:17,640
tastes like specifically this black and red raspberry gummies that's what this tastes like

1251
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:22,440
to me some people say cotton candy ah yes i don't know and apparently there's a new uh they're doing

1252
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:26,600
something like pixels i think is you know here i am giving coke free ad dollars but you know what

1253
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:33,720
here's the downside because i like this because i like this i drew this i'm already not able to

1254
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:39,400
find the 12 packs anymore and it's just i know it's going to disappear shit i love always goes

1255
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:46,680
away i feel your pain on that because there are certain flavors of coke and pepsi i cannot get

1256
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:53,240
here in brooklyn but if i cross the bridge to jersey it's right there but i'm just like i

1257
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:59,000
don't believe this actually happens this this fictional land of not having to pump my own gas

1258
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:06,120
and finding new flavors of pepsi all right that is it that is going to do it for another episode

1259
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:10,200
