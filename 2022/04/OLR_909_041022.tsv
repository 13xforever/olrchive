0	13240	There's been a disturbing trend of businesses and official bodies using temporary statuses
13240	16800	to get around organizational measures despite the strife it causes everyone.
16800	20240	Gig work was not the start of it, but today it is second only to retail as a significant
20240	21240	example.
21240	23840	Who else but Activision Blizzard forced the hand of their workers to vote in favor of
23840	28240	their rights, bringing better pay, insurance, benefits to a dearly overworked and underappreciated
28240	29240	group.
29240	32320	With a political wonk intro, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers,
32320	34880	and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34880	38280	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
38280	42660	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42660	47680	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47680	53360	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 909 of our
53360	57140	show for this April the 10th of 2022.
57140	59020	My name is Rob Robertson.
59020	63840	I am joined every week here via the magic of the internet and Discord and things like
63840	65640	that with my co-hosts.
65640	68620	Say hello to Zoltar.
68620	69620	No it starts.
69620	70620	I'm not Zoltar.
70620	72180	It's Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.
72180	74220	Hold on, I forgot to turn on my lamps.
74220	79180	But you have that shirt that says Zoltar and it's just, sorry, I can't help it.
79180	81180	So I'm like, is this like the movie big?
81180	83400	Well the shirt actually, hold on.
83400	87400	I like the shirt.
87400	89400	It's a little big.
89400	91080	Oh, it's coin up downtown.
91080	92080	Oh, I see.
92080	93080	I see.
93080	94080	The other voice you hear.
94080	98280	And they got a cease and desist on it and I have one of the last ones you can get.
98280	101960	Oh, that's fun to always get something that's been declared illegal.
101960	105440	The other voice you hear there, of course, Techmaster Loki joining us tonight.
105440	106440	Hi, Loki.
106440	107440	Hello.
107440	109960	I had worms crawling on me, so that was not good.
109960	110960	What?
110960	111960	Gross.
112520	117200	You know, it's the season where the oak worms or whatever those are, like fall from the
117200	118200	trees and stuff.
118200	119200	Oh.
119200	122320	So there was like something earlier, like I felt crawling on me and I like threw it
122320	123320	off.
123320	124320	No thanks.
124320	125320	I didn't see where it went.
125320	130120	My new house does not have a front or a backyard and this is why.
130120	132140	This is exactly what those things are.
132140	133400	We have a giant tree.
133400	134400	I don't know what they are.
134400	135400	They're like, I thought they're called oak worms.
135400	137800	I've never had worms fall out of a tree.
137800	141160	Well, they're less worms and more like caterpillar looking things.
141160	143280	They're like tiny little like green.
143280	144280	They're not.
144280	145280	It's more of a caterpillar.
145280	146280	Like a little grub?
146280	147280	I guess.
147280	148280	Yes.
148280	149280	Or it's got legs.
149280	153560	So, I mean, it's sort of, it's more caterpillar, but like, yeah, they hang from like a little
153560	157800	tiny, it looks like a, a spider web type thing.
157800	162680	They hang down a little string and they swing there in the tree and so they'll drop on you
162680	163680	sometimes.
163680	164680	All right.
164680	168360	Well, let me come back to you in a second, Loki, to talk about worms and not the, you
168360	174480	know, classic PC and PlayStation and a multi-platform game, but Dark Sakura, your shirt, Zoltar, it
174480	178440	makes me think there is actually, this is going to be very random, but I don't care.
178440	184500	There's actually a pokey stop portal, depending on what game you play, called Zoltar that
184500	185500	I saw in Vegas.
185500	189320	And so your shirt made me think of that because you know, those, those machines are kind of
189320	191680	everywhere in the big tourist trap areas.
191680	192680	So cool.
192680	193960	It's fun.
193960	194960	Yeah.
195720	200040	Going back to Loki, I see the game playing behind you tonight because we do tape live
200040	205000	every Sunday night at 9 PM Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv
205000	210160	slash a VOG network, VOG network, right after the Bobby black will show.
210160	215880	And you know, if you, if you watch our videos you can see us, you know, talking and doing
215880	218720	our show, but sometimes we have things going on behind us.
218720	223840	And so Loki has a Sonic the Hedgehog playing and I think hedgehog too.
223840	224840	Okay.
224840	231160	So I'm thinking this must be to do with the movie and knowing that you are a big Jim Carrey
231160	236000	fan, knowing that you have kids that are right around the right age for this, I'm going to
236000	239000	guess you went and saw Sonic 2 this weekend.
239000	240000	And how was it?
240000	241000	How was it?
241000	242000	I mean, it's great.
242000	243000	I loved it.
243000	244000	Yeah.
244000	245000	I love Jim Carrey.
245000	246000	Was that white parts in the mood?
246000	248480	There's parts of the movie that didn't need to be there.
248480	252160	They were, I don't know who they're supposed to be funny for, I guess adults, but it was
252160	256720	just like, kind of, it's fine, you know?
256720	261960	And funny, one of the characters in there is a character, it's an actor that was in
261960	273200	the show Criminal Minds that my wife has nicknamed Wigglebrows anyways, but it's funny to see
273200	276340	him play a special agent as well in this.
276340	277340	But yeah, it was great.
277340	283540	I think, you know, they really did a good job of capturing, you know, just all the characters
283540	284540	that are in it.
284540	290620	It's a little disappointing to hear that Jim Carrey might not be doing the next movie,
290620	294540	because he's retiring from acting, but we'll see.
294540	296620	If not, they can move with him.
296620	299740	Without getting spoilery, because I don't want to be mean.
299740	305420	There's some people that haven't seen it yet, but I understand there is a post credit sequence
305420	310700	that sets it up so that Jim Carrey doesn't have to be there.
310700	311700	Sort of.
311700	312700	Yeah, yeah.
312700	313700	Yeah.
313700	317020	But there is something that was revealed that is, you know, they could make a movie around
317020	318020	that.
318020	320660	But it's not going to be as exciting for you, because you're just, you're a Jim Carrey fan.
320660	323140	Anyway, it's like Jim Carrey, old video games.
323140	324140	It's a good mix.
324140	325140	Yeah, exactly.
325140	328820	Well, the movie's number one in the box office this weekend, and it did even better than
328820	329820	the first one.
329820	333740	And I have to admit, I'm kind of not surprised, like, I think we're in this era now.
333740	339060	And I think this is why now Nintendo is revisiting the Mario movie concept, right?
339060	344580	Because we all know about the Mario movie in the late 80s that was not good, the one
344580	345580	with Bob Hoskins.
345580	349460	Right, because now you have people that, like, have grown up with video games that are now
349460	351220	directors and producers and stuff.
351220	352220	That's it.
352220	354260	We have the technology for the CG.
354260	358660	And that too, but like, you have people that actually care about the, you know, they grew
358660	359660	up with this stuff.
359660	364580	And now they want to, like, pay tribute to it instead of just like, oh, I'm a director
364580	369500	and I'm going to make a movie because it'll make money because it's a property type of
369500	370500	thing.
370500	375940	I only, only, only ever can think of John Leguizamo in one role.
375940	377380	I that was a CG.
377380	383100	I was going to say in To Wong Foo, I mean, some people might say like spawn or something,
383100	384100	but no.
384100	387040	Little Latin boy, why are you crying?
387040	389040	There's also the very good in spawn.
389040	392400	The Romeo and Juliet movie, which I loved.
392400	396880	I know a lot of people didn't love that Baz Luhrmann Romeo and Juliet I think was an incredibly
396880	397880	underrated movie.
397880	399920	I think that movie is phenomenal.
399920	404800	I think you have to be, well, I think you have to be a certain age.
404800	410560	I think it's one of those, like, it's definitely a Gen X movie, not just Gen X, but like Gen
410560	415840	X, late Gen X, where we are the Oregon Trail, Zillennial, if you will, that whole thing.
415840	419680	I think you have to specifically be in that age range to appreciate that Romeo and Juliet
419680	420680	movie.
420680	421680	I don't know what it is.
421680	425640	I don't know if it's because of who's in it, but, or, or just what it was doing for movies.
425640	430120	Well, speaking of what things are doing for movies, I haven't heard a bad thing about
430120	431120	that.
431120	433880	Everything everywhere all at once that new Michelle Yeoh movie.
433880	435020	I love her.
435020	436760	I absolutely love her.
436760	442120	I think she's one of the best things to happen to Star Trek in however long.
442120	444000	I think she's incredible.
444000	447920	And I'm, I'm happy she's getting to headline a movie and the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis
447920	451320	is in it and they got data to un-retire.
451320	454680	I think that, yeah, so that's the movie I wanted to go see this weekend, but we just
454680	455680	didn't get around to it.
455680	458960	We had some other stuff going, no, no, not, not that data.
458960	462400	I mean data, data from the Goonies, that data Star Trek.
462400	470520	And I was thinking, sorry, no, no, fair, fair, yeah, well, I'm sorry, short round round.
470980	476720	If you want to talk about Picard, let's talk about season three and un-retiring because
476720	482200	they just, they fucking got everybody, everybody, except for Wesley, but you know, but for all
482200	488120	we know, for all we know, he'll have a cameo, but you know, everybody's like, where's X,
488120	489120	where's Y, you know what?
489120	492000	They got the top lines there.
492000	497440	So I mean, if Denise Crosby shows up, that's just a plus at that point in my opinion.
497440	500320	So that's that.
500320	503720	Let's see, SJ 100 Matt in chat talking about the Sonic movie says they released it at the
503720	504880	right time.
504880	508440	Not a lot of big movies come out during Oscar season because they're too busy promoting
508440	510100	previous year's movies.
510100	512760	They came in just after that and the summer blockbusters.
512760	515520	Yeah, I think, and this is similar with games.
515520	520900	I know it's a video game podcast, but I think, I think that concept of like the right time
520900	523780	to release something kind of went out the window.
523780	527360	Like I don't think movies have to come out in the summer or the winter anymore.
527360	531160	And I think like, they just put out a Batman movie a few weeks ago.
531160	534280	Like, you know, there there's movies that do very scream.
534280	536920	The reboot did better, almost better than there.
536920	540300	I don't know how well it did, but I know it did better than scream four.
540300	544320	And that was like, what a January February release, you know, so honestly enough parsing
544320	550560	them out like this, remove some of the competition for people who have to pick and choose what
550560	554800	movies they're going to go see at any given point in time who don't have the disposable
554800	559640	income to go see multiple movies, especially with how expensive it's become.
559640	563880	Tiger Claw on chat says Sonic two made 71 million at the box office more than the first
563880	564880	movie.
564880	566120	Well, I'm not I'm not terribly surprised.
566120	573560	A on the pandemic kind of hobbled the first movie's ability to play more than what one
573560	574560	weekend.
574560	576560	That was just before pandemic.
576560	582040	Well, and I think a lot of people ended up seeing the first movie on demand and all that
582040	583040	stuff.
583040	584040	So I think this is a very interesting.
584280	586600	I mean, I talk about the pandemic like it's over.
586600	587600	It's not.
587600	589800	But we have precautions and vaccinations now.
589800	594880	So more people are willing to go out and do these types of things.
594880	599320	So and with everything you were saying, Matt, I think it's not just the directors and the
599320	601520	filmmakers that are the right age.
601520	602520	But it's the audience.
602520	607400	I mean, you admittedly, you are a perfect example for somebody that loves Sonic growing
607400	608400	up.
608400	609680	And now you have kids.
609680	614040	That's the thing is I never really played the Sonic games too much aside.
614040	615040	Did you have to?
615040	616040	Did you?
616040	617040	You know the basics?
617040	621640	You know, the Green Hill Zone melody, you know, Sonic goes fast, like I would bet that
621640	625680	when it comes to the story and the lore, and this is where I think Sonic three and so on
625680	630880	gets in trouble when you get to the more, I don't want to say B tier characters, but
630880	635720	it is what it well, we've all we've had the OLRN joke for forever about Sonic and all
635720	637080	of his shitty friends, right?
637080	646640	There's a lot of there's a lot of shitty friends that you know, are Yeah, so anyway.
646640	650800	The only reason I would want to see Sonic to though is because knuckles and who voiced
650800	651800	him.
651800	653480	He was knuckles was good.
653480	661640	He was a very good character knuckles I've always been a knuckles fan since since knuckles
661640	663600	came out.
663600	669100	So knuckles was my favorite part of playing a Sonic adventure.
669100	673360	Just as long as we don't get all the ones that came later does not necessary All right.
673360	679160	But I like I like like SPO and some of the chaotic characters Yeah, but like, they're
679160	683200	not going to have that same recognition because you have to know the games to know those types
683200	684200	of characters.
684200	686880	I think when they start getting that deep, it's going to get so difficult.
686880	691800	And I said this last movie, and I'm gonna say it again, because of the end, the end
691800	697720	credit stuff, but like, and this is not spoiler, they do this on both of the movies, they do
697720	703800	like kind of a replay of the movie, but done in the style of the eight big games or 16
703800	705000	big games.
705000	710840	They need to make a Sonic the Hedgehog the movie, like 2d side scrolling game done in
710840	713560	that graphic style, because it's, it's absolutely awesome.
713560	715880	Like it really needs to be a thing.
715880	718240	They need to make a movie.
718240	721960	That's Sonic racing with Danica Patrick starring in it.
721960	724440	She was Oh, yeah, she wasn't.
724440	725440	Yes, she was.
725440	726440	Yes, she was.
726440	731560	Well, that's gonna be the sake multiverse movies when they do one Sonic racing that
731560	737320	I care about that Sonic are and they actually get Lady Miss cure somehow to play ooh, la
737320	738320	la.
738320	739960	I don't care if she's like approaching 60.
739960	742120	At this point, she still needs to play ooh, la la.
742120	743520	It'll be amazing.
743520	745240	Anyway, s2100.
745240	749760	Matt has a great point in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network live on this Sunday night
749760	755600	saying, I will give them props talk about a total reversal, creepy Sonic from the first
755600	760640	movie, redoing Sonic because of it to an actual franchise that's breaking records.
760640	765320	You know what Matt brings up a great point about remember when that first Sonic movie
765320	770040	was in a heap of trouble because of how Sonic looked, and they actually went back and redid
770040	772440	it and now, you know, yeah, good point.
772440	778240	I mean, if they hadn't done that, we probably wouldn't have had this movie make $71 million
778240	781600	because we wouldn't have had it at all if Sonic hadn't hadn't changed from that first
781600	782600	one.
782600	787200	So that is is kind of an interesting point how that internet rage against the very first
787200	792640	Sonic trailer, maybe, maybe it's an example of internet rage actually doing some good
792640	793640	in this world.
793640	794640	Who knew?
794640	795640	Who knew?
795640	800800	Although I would pay to see a bad Sonic version of Sonic the movie, you know, just work.
800800	805560	It would be nice to have that cut like that, that extra that Blu ray extra, right?
805560	812520	Like that, like the like the cat butthole cut, you know, I need to see the bad Sonic
812520	813520	cut.
813520	814520	Absolutely.
814520	819040	All right, let's get into some news for the night.
819040	822500	And we're gonna get into the first and I just I just realized you want to hear something
822500	823720	really funny.
823720	829180	I just realized my stream deck is not even plugged in currently, so I can't scroll the
829180	830900	bar on the side.
830900	832380	So please give me a minute.
832380	836220	And we'll get into our first story and pretty soon the bar on the side for those watching
836220	837540	live at Twitch.
837540	838900	We'll catch up.
838900	841300	So let's get into our first story tonight.
841300	842300	Rob.
842300	843300	Yeah.
843300	846800	For the record, Lady Miss Keir has a tumbler.
846800	849180	Who still has a tumbler?
849180	850180	Even the tumbler.
850180	853660	Okay, yeah, I was gonna say, hold on her blog.
853660	858260	Hold up, Lady Miss contrarian because you just talked about your mass affecting tumbler
858260	859620	and how you don't use it anymore.
859620	861580	And you had a lot of people over there.
861580	866180	I'd still exist, but she's got a tumbler.
866180	867180	Interesting.
867180	868180	All right.
868180	870920	Let's move on to our kickoff topic for the night.
870920	872620	And that is about a game.
872620	874380	I don't think it was one of those.
874380	875940	We weren't expecting it this week.
875940	876940	But here it is.
876940	877940	Right, Loki?
877940	883180	Yeah, so we weren't expecting the announcement of Kingdom Hearts four, but that's what we
883180	885100	got a trailer.
885100	888340	And they were doing some 20th anniversary events.
888340	892860	And they wrapped up with the trailer for the new game or I guess sort of an announcement.
892860	898340	And then also an announcement for a game called Kingdom Hearts missing link.
898340	904860	I my main gripe right now with Kingdom Hearts four is that logo is awful.
904860	907560	It's awful because it looks like Kingdom.
907560	909420	It looks like Kingdom Hearts three.
909420	910420	It isn't good.
910420	911420	You're right.
911420	916420	The V look like a V and not just like it looks like Kingdom Hearts three at a glance like
916420	922260	you have to really get in there with a magnifying glass and go Okay, it's for you know, but
922260	923900	it's just, I don't know.
923900	930580	Otherwise the game looks I mean, it looks nice source obviously been like, he's looking
930580	932940	more, you know, for delicate as ever.
932940	936260	I mean, I don't know.
936260	939260	I I'm so far removed from Kingdom Hearts right now.
939260	940900	Like I can't even like,
940900	942340	Okay, get into this.
942340	943340	Mike Deft.
943340	944460	Mike never played it.
944460	948580	Mike Deft brings up a good question, which logo is better?
948580	952780	Street Fighter four or excuse me, Street Fighter six or Kingdom Hearts four?
952780	956380	Because I would say Street Fighter six Kingdom Hearts four for that.
956380	958860	Okay, so there's there's difference.
958860	963060	Street Fighter six, they put no effort into it Kingdom Hearts four they put effort into
963060	964060	it.
964060	969900	But like, the font is just bad that like it's just they they need to make a choice.
969900	972180	It was a choice like choices were made.
972180	976340	The arms of the V are vertical like they are parallel with each other.
976340	983180	It just it's hard to like I get it stylistic but like maybe make it more like a V. That's
983180	987060	my only complaint is such a minor complaint but it's it is weird because I was looking
987060	988060	at the logos.
988060	990980	I'm like, why do you have Kingdom Hearts three on there and then I had to like really look
990980	998980	at my Oh, that's for Okay, well, cool but so some other things so with the new trailer
998980	1004300	that they had, they were showing some different kind of scenes that kind of shut off the better
1004300	1009020	graphics and one of the scenes was like of a creek or something like that.
1009020	1016020	And we see some metal looking thing that could possibly be like an AT AT or ATS t leg or
1016020	1017260	foot or something.
1017260	1022060	So folks are saying well, maybe Star Wars is going to be in there which is very possible
1022060	1026740	considering that Disney does own all of the properties now Star Star Wars making its way
1026740	1028160	in there would make a lot of sense.
1028160	1031080	And I thought I haven't hasn't ever had a discussion about that before when the third
1031080	1034520	game came out because that was right around the time that Disney was buying Star Wars
1034520	1039400	and there was like mutual interest around trying to do it again to get Avengers two.
1039400	1044320	I just want more Tron to be honest so same Yeah, yes.
1044320	1050120	But we'll see also look even more amazing now with all the Yeah, yeah, current gen graphics
1050120	1055080	deaf to saying Simpsons world and Kingdom Hearts for although that's still all the Disney
1055080	1058240	own Fox now what doesn't Disney Oh, they do own Jesus.
1058240	1059240	We have X.
1059240	1060240	Oh, that's right.
1060240	1068040	Because Frank inverters world, but then I want my Rocky horror picture show world Transylvania
1068040	1069400	we need it.
1069400	1071500	So who I mean, literally anything and everything can be in there.
1071500	1073480	But it looks like judging for the trailer.
1073480	1077320	It's more of a and I think the gag would be that it's the real world.
1077320	1080480	And that maybe it's real world locations.
1080480	1082240	And that could be very interesting as well.
1082240	1086280	I think also surprising for a lot of people with the trailer I know it was for me is that
1086280	1090400	there's gameplay in it or hypothetical gameplay.
1090400	1094800	One could argue that we're looking at target render with that, that maybe it doesn't actually
1094800	1095800	look like that.
1095800	1102220	Yeah, but still, you get the sense that there is, you know, gameplay, you know, you're looking
1102220	1103220	at it.
1103220	1106760	And and the reason why I say it's surprising is because I think most people expected when
1106760	1112960	they announced Kingdom Hearts for it'll have Sora Donald goofy fade in, fade out logo,
1112960	1116160	some cryptic thing that doesn't make sense because the story doesn't make sense those
1116160	1117440	games anyway.
1117440	1118440	And then that's it.
1118440	1121440	We'll see the game in 25 years.
1121440	1124980	And that's, that's, that's where we figured that but now it's like, oh, it's maybe they
1124980	1127480	actually have something playable in there.
1127480	1131480	Wow, okay, maybe we will be seeing this thing a little bit sooner.
1131480	1134520	Because everybody's been joking about how it's going to be, you know, 50 years before
1134520	1137660	even I wrote that tweet where I'm like, I can't wait to play it in heaven because I'll
1137660	1139720	be dead before this thing comes out.
1139720	1143080	But some folks are saying you know what, maybe it's not going to be so bad.
1143080	1149480	I guess I guess from Kingdom Hearts three announcement to game arrival was only six
1149480	1150960	years.
1150960	1155660	Only just just to put it in perspective.
1155660	1161920	If this game comes out in only six years, we'll, we'll, we'll be 50 or damn close to
1161920	1162920	it.
1162920	1164640	Getting to play this game.
1164640	1171720	As soon as I mean, considering that they said they celebrated their 20th anniversary, and
1171720	1175880	there's only three games out well three, you know, there's more than three there's a start
1175880	1181320	to see a points out it's the 16th game in the timeline, there's more than three.
1181320	1186200	It's just the third mainline game, you're forgetting all the line of all that she could
1186200	1190160	one that I am not going to try to explain on this three hour podcast, because three
1190160	1193680	hours isn't enough time to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.
1193680	1197040	It's just not to go along with all that.
1197040	1202240	So because Kingdom Hearts four was, I guess, announced and everything there, folks are
1202240	1207320	saying that the GeForce now link or leak that had Kingdom Hearts four I guess as part of
1207320	1210960	that is expected to maybe be true.
1210960	1215600	I don't know though Kingdom Hearts four seems kind of like an easy guess that there's going
1215600	1219400	to be a Kingdom Hearts four I mean,
1219400	1226280	it is but I guess you know what wasn't as easy of a guest was Chrono Cross getting remastered.
1226280	1230000	And it's kind of like it's all happening around the same time.
1230000	1231800	And I think that's what's lending itself to this.
1231800	1232800	But here's the thing.
1232800	1238360	Okay, so they talk about a Final Fantasy nine remake, and I feel like everybody's brain
1238360	1241640	is going to what they did with Final Fantasy seven remake.
1241640	1244880	And I'm like, hold your horses, people.
1244880	1246440	Hold your horses.
1246440	1249780	Because who's to say the Final Fantasy nine remake isn't going to look like the Final
1249780	1253100	Fantasy eight remaster or whatever it is they did recently.
1253100	1255240	And that is it's kind of garbage.
1255240	1259840	Like I'm sorry, and that isn't me trying to dig on the game because you all know, I don't
1259840	1263320	care for the gameplay and Final Fantasy eight, the plot is fine.
1263320	1265640	I don't care for the gameplay.
1265640	1269640	But I mean, playing it on because it was on Xbox Game Pass not that long ago, it looked
1269640	1275200	like duty kaka because you had these like new sprites on blurred backgrounds.
1275200	1279000	It just it was really not a good look.
1279000	1283280	And I'm understanding again, I don't want to pick a fresh wound.
1283280	1287960	But a lot of the feedback I'm hearing on Chrono Cross is that it's in a similar place.
1287960	1293800	So I worry the Final Fantasy nine is going to be ending up this direction as well, in
1293800	1296760	which case hard pass.
1296760	1301600	It doesn't look like it's worth the restoration to be honest.
1301600	1303800	So I didn't even play it the first time.
1303800	1305120	Oh, Final Fantasy nine.
1305120	1308280	Yeah, I started it and it was so boring.
1308280	1313240	It like I think the game plays better than eight, but y'all know how I feel about eight,
1313240	1315000	but I do have a better story.
1315000	1322040	I do agree that the plot for nine is it just doesn't hold up in your memory as well as
1322040	1326640	almost any of the other games in the franchise save for maybe like two and 15.
1326640	1329080	I didn't care about the story in nine.
1329080	1330080	Exactly.
1330080	1331160	I didn't care about the characters.
1331160	1332160	They were not engaging.
1332160	1333160	Yeah.
1333520	1334520	I kind of agree with you on that.
1334520	1337480	And I that was one of the games I did pick that up right at launch too.
1337480	1343640	And I remember playing it going, Oh, I was expecting more seven and eight.
1343640	1345240	This is all right, I guess.
1345240	1349160	But now Final Fantasy nine could also be a middle ground.
1349160	1355640	And I would say that's the live a live route where they're using the engine for triangle
1355640	1358040	strategy and Octopath Traveler and all that.
1358040	1359680	I think that would be great.
1359680	1362200	However, my I want to see that was six.
1362240	1364040	Well, I need to see that was six or four.
1364040	1368120	My only concern with that is that live alive was a Super Nintendo game.
1368120	1372760	And that engine looks to be a little better at adapting Super Nintendo stuff.
1372760	1375480	But I'm also not a programmer.
1376200	1379880	So I don't want to sit here and say it's easier or harder.
1379880	1384520	I just if Final Fantasy nine were to look like that live live reboot, I think that would
1384520	1386360	do a lot more justice.
1386360	1391480	But I also agree with what you're saying, Loki, is that I would far more want to see
1391480	1395160	four or five and six all done in that engine first.
1395160	1401320	And honestly, and this may shock you, I would love to see Chrono Trigger in that engine
1401320	1401720	as well.
1402360	1406520	So I hope that live alive does very well for them.
1406520	1409640	And they are convinced to put more of the Super Nintendo catalog in there.
1410280	1415000	And then there's Oh, gosh, there's also those rumors about Enix titles that were under consideration
1415000	1415880	at one point.
1415880	1421240	Do you know, I, I will put out for the quintet trilogy to come back.
1421240	1422440	Brain Lord and Terran.
1422440	1425400	I will put out like, show me who I have to put it.
1425400	1426520	I will do it.
1426520	1428840	I will do and you're welcome next.
1429720	1431640	It's, it's such a good trilogy.
1432680	1433960	And I would love those.
1433960	1435960	Those games really need to come back.
1435960	1438920	I mean, like Final Fantasy six, Final Fantasy four.
1438920	1440200	I love those games.
1440760	1443240	They literally just got re released.
1443240	1446920	You know, whether, whether you cared for the re release or not, they literally just
1446920	1447960	got re released.
1447960	1450920	So we probably don't need to revisit those games again for five years.
1451720	1453400	Gaia, Terranigma.
1454200	1457320	Those games have never been touched since the Super Nintendo days.
1457320	1458280	Never been touched.
1458840	1461560	So I think those games are due.
1461560	1463960	So fingers and toes crossed, to be honest.
1465960	1466600	S2 100.
1466600	1471080	Matt in chat says, I feel like Final Fantasy nine came out at the end of the PlayStation
1471080	1475480	one life cycle, which at that point I moved on to Dreamcast and other stuff.
1475480	1476520	Well, that's a lot of the problem.
1476520	1481080	Final Fantasy 12 faced is it came out at the end of the PlayStation two life cycle.
1481720	1485320	Not every PlayStation three could play PlayStation two stuff.
1485320	1488280	And a lot of people were going to Xbox 360 at that point.
1489240	1491880	So a lot of people miss Final Fantasy 12.
1491880	1497400	So 12 really didn't get its due until the, the remaster they did recently.
1497400	1502200	And, you know, honestly, a lot of the work that the team did on Final Fantasy 14, because
1502200	1505960	it's the same business unit within Square Enix that did 12.
1505960	1510360	I don't think it's technically the same business, but a lot of the same people that did 12 did
1510360	1511080	14.
1511080	1512840	And there's a lot with that.
1512840	1522680	So anyway, so the earlier Nvidia leak, honestly, it's probably it's true.
1522680	1526600	Let's just let it's true, but I'm more excited for the tactics.
1527640	1527960	Now.
1527960	1530680	Now there's, there's a game for live, alive.
1530680	1534920	I was like, there's the game that, and that it's, it's sure.
1534920	1535240	Okay.
1535240	1540040	We, we had advance on, um, the Game Boy advance.
1540040	1540540	You know what?
1541560	1542520	Final Fantasy Tactics.
1542520	1543020	It's time.
1544280	1546600	Let's, let's, let's do that one in the live, alive engine.
1546600	1548120	I'd be very happy about that.
1548120	1550200	I don't even like tactical games.
1550200	1551640	That one I really like.
1552360	1553960	So there's that.
1553960	1554460	All right.
1555100	1559100	Let's talk about other things we like in our gaming week with a segment that we call.
1559100	1560140	How was your gaming week?
1560140	1563260	Where we talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1563260	1563900	Dark soccer.
1563900	1564540	I'll start with you.
1565980	1570300	Um, I'm playing, uh, taking density three.
1570300	1573820	Uh, I should be done with it soon.
1573820	1574620	Come to think of it.
1575340	1576700	Um, I just got flammie.
1576700	1578380	I was so excited to get flammie.
1578380	1581820	I peeked at your stream last night for a hot minute and I could tell you're close to the
1581820	1582320	end.
1583020	1583520	Yeah.
1584080	1587760	Um, I, uh, word.
1588960	1596400	I'm also playing, um, dead by daylight and I actually had like the most amazing round
1596400	1601760	of pig games and then I played somebody else and it was kind of crap, but all my pig games
1601760	1602640	were great.
1602640	1607040	And then I made friends in one of my last pig games cause it turned into a boop match.
1607040	1613440	And if anyone doesn't know what boop in the snoot is, go look it up.
1614640	1617280	Cause I had many, many snoot boops.
1618480	1621120	Um, and I made friends with, with like the entire party.
1621120	1622400	So it was pretty great.
1622400	1628960	Um, other than that, I've just been prepping stuff up for my birthday marathon on Thursday
1629760	1634880	and you know, just trying to think of welts I'm going to be playing as I am going to do
1635360	1636320	Terranigma next.
1637600	1641200	And I've just been getting things prepped up for that and need to go find sprites to
1641200	1642560	do my chat windows and whatnot.
1642560	1643060	But yeah.
1643920	1646720	Well, good luck with the, uh, birthday marathon on Thursday.
1646720	1650160	So, uh, if I can stay awake, I can barely keep my eyes open now.
1651040	1654400	Hope you get cake or whatever it is you desire.
1654400	1654880	I bought myself a cake.
1656560	1657680	Uh, what kind of cake?
1657680	1658640	A little chocolate torte.
1659680	1660180	Yummy.
1660720	1662240	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1663120	1664560	Uh, mostly Minecraft.
1664880	1671760	As usual, I've been just working on prepping stuff for future episodes and all that.
1671760	1677600	Uh, I don't remember this week was look at the calendar here.
1677600	1680080	I think I did some of the April fool's stuff this week.
1680080	1680400	Yeah.
1680400	1684400	Cause we, we had our, I did a late roll fools stuff.
1684400	1689120	So I was pulling pranks, I guess, on our server, um, doing different things with that.
1689120	1691200	So I put out a video about that and that was fun.
1691760	1696640	Uh, I did play something else other than just Minecraft.
1696640	1701200	I checked out cause I saw another YouTuber playing it, uh, Ali 43.
1701200	1703920	There was this game called instruments of destruction.
1703920	1708880	It's kind of like, um, Oh God, I don't even remember the original game now.
1708880	1715440	Um, it's basically a game where you build machines that can break stuff and then you
1715440	1719920	drive them through these islands and you break stuff with them.
1719920	1721840	So it's all physics based.
1721840	1727360	Um, you've got like a saw blades and stuff you can put on your machines, wrecking balls
1727360	1728960	and all sorts of things in it.
1728960	1730320	Everything breaks really nice.
1730320	1732320	There's lots of physics involved with everything.
1732320	1733920	So it just looks really cool.
1733920	1737280	So I checked it out and it's all right.
1737280	1741840	It, it, I don't know if I play it for a long time, but it's, it's okay.
1741840	1745680	I'm really now I'm kind of bothered cause I don't remember what that other game I'm
1745680	1746960	thinking of was.
1747040	1751200	There was another one though, similar kind of style where you didn't really like the
1751200	1756800	break things you had to like defeat an army of like, it's like a medieval thing.
1756800	1760480	I don't remember his call though, but, um, both fun.
1760480	1763840	So yeah, check it out if you like that kind of, you know, physics based stuff.
1763840	1767120	It's still an early access, but it's only like 20 bucks.
1767120	1768080	So it's not bad.
1769600	1770560	Uh, that's it.
1770560	1774320	I didn't get to play as any DDR this week because it was a little warm.
1774320	1776000	It was like, we're almost 90.
1776000	1777040	So the garage, right?
1778800	1780800	Uh, this week should be a little bit better than this.
1780800	1783200	Hopefully I'll get into a little bit of that.
1783200	1784880	It's supposed to be in the sixties tomorrow.
1785440	1785760	Yeah.
1785760	1787680	And for like the early part of the week too.
1787680	1791040	So looking forward to that, what's that game?
1792000	1794000	I don't know why I'm going through my steam library.
1794000	1795040	Like, Oh, there it is.
1795040	1798560	Like I'm going to find it amongst all these like 700 games that are in here.
1798560	1802320	But, um, yeah, that was, it's a fun game.
1802320	1803360	Just check it out though.
1803360	1803860	Right.
1804420	1809300	Uh, my gaming week, um, I have a confession to make.
1810020	1812020	This is, this is hard.
1814580	1815060	Okay.
1815060	1820260	Um, this week I, I played Fortnite.
1823940	1826260	I don't know why I, I've seen a lot.
1826260	1826820	Okay.
1826820	1828500	I can try Roblox next.
1828500	1831060	I've seen a lot of, a lot of my friends play Fortnite.
1831300	1835220	I've seen a lot of, like, it seems to be having this weird resurgence on Twitch lately.
1835220	1836660	Well, it's actually, no, it's not weird.
1836660	1838260	I'm telling you what the secret sauce is.
1838260	1842660	It's the no build mode is that now everybody is like, Oh, Fortnite's interesting again.
1842660	1847300	Which is funny because you know, a lot of the Fortnite faithful were like, Oh, they're
1847300	1850580	going to add this mode that just makes it generically like every other shooter.
1850580	1852260	And that's going to make the game more interesting.
1853380	1860100	Yeah, yeah, it is actually because the building thing put a lot of people off and yeah, the
1860100	1862500	fact that now it's just like every other shooter.
1862500	1869540	So it's easier to get into, but it's every other shooter with Ariana Grande, the Marvel
1869540	1875700	cinematic universe, Assassin's Creed characters, the kitchen sink, whatever else they're throwing
1875700	1876660	at this game.
1876660	1878340	It actually makes it kind of interesting.
1878340	1880900	So, um, yeah, I've been playing a little bit of Fortnite.
1880900	1884820	Actually, it's the creative mode for me and it's, it's interesting.
1885620	1889460	I give Epic games a lot of shit and rightfully so let's be clear.
1890820	1894660	Tim Sweeney is kind of an asshole on social media.
1894660	1897380	Like I'm just I'm just he's kind of an asshole on social media.
1898100	1902260	But I can't ignore that he created ZZT, right?
1902260	1908660	Which which is a retro game that a lot of us hold in high fucking regard, right is ZZT.
1909620	1915540	And it's interesting because when I play creative mode in Fortnite, I see those little glimpses
1915540	1916260	of ZZT.
1917380	1924020	Like, and I kind of go, I see, I see how we got from that to this.
1924900	1928580	Not that I'm saying Fortnite's as good as ZZT, nothing's ever going to live up to those
1928580	1929780	memories from those days.
1929780	1934580	But I see how we got from that to this.
1934580	1935860	And I think it's kind of interesting.
1935860	1936260	I don't know.
1936820	1943140	So there's been that I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14 because there's finally the
1943140	1947220	new patch, the first Endwalker patch is out on Tuesday.
1947220	1951780	And I'm really hyped for it because we really don't know where the story is going next.
1952980	1957300	You know, because they wrapped everything up at the end of the patch 6.0.
1958980	1963380	I've also really enjoyed in the past couple weeks, I really like to watch reaction videos
1963380	1966020	to a few of the big cutscenes towards the end of Endwalker.
1966740	1969860	I won't repeat because I know not everybody here has played it.
1969860	1973860	But there's some very key cutscenes towards the end of the game and watching people's
1973860	1977380	reaction to them just they get very sad.
1977380	1978660	And then I get very sad.
1978660	1981140	And it's this very interesting sort of therapy thing.
1981140	1985940	So I'm really excited for some news story and to see what we can react to next in that
1985940	1992340	game because they really did kind of close up most of the loose ends at the end of Endwalker.
1993220	1995380	So be curious to see where they go next.
1995380	2001700	So Zen Monkey 11 in chat says, Wait a minute, this is the first time I'm hearing this, they
2001700	2002980	remove the building in the game?
2002980	2004340	Or is it just a new mode?
2004340	2005860	If they remove the building, that's done.
2005860	2007140	That was the main thing I liked about it.
2007140	2008020	It is a new mode.
2008580	2011540	So when you go to select like, do you want to play squad?
2011540	2012420	Do you want to play?
2012420	2016100	You can also play zero build is a new mode they put in it.
2016100	2018260	And there's a lot of people that are into that.
2018260	2020500	So yeah, it's just a new mode.
2020500	2024500	So if you if you're a building loyalist, then you still have your thing.
2024500	2025540	Don't worry about it.
2025540	2031860	I think for a temporary amount of time, zero build was the only way to play but that's
2031860	2032420	that's done.
2032980	2034740	So that's that on Fortnite.
2036900	2041060	Fifth Dream says I want to come back to Final Fantasy 14 when more stuff is soloable in
2041060	2041860	future patches.
2041860	2047460	Well, that's one of the big things about this patch they're putting out is that I believe
2048100	2052100	the entirety of a realm reborn is now soloable.
2052580	2056340	So all of those dungeons they've remade to be trust dungeons.
2056340	2064500	They are completely redoing the end game story dungeons, the Praetorium and Castrum meridian
2064500	2067380	are now four player not eight player and you can run them with trust.
2067940	2071060	So yeah, so they're there.
2071700	2075300	Realm Reborn I think is going to be 100% soloable.
2075300	2081460	I might be wrong in that you might have to do a couple of fights still in a party but
2081460	2082500	it should be very minimal.
2083300	2085140	So I think it's interesting.
2085140	2088420	And that's the part that's free to play too, which is even more interesting.
2088420	2091860	So I think they let the free to play players back in.
2091860	2092420	Yes, they did.
2092420	2092920	They did.
2093380	2097060	So otherwise, I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight.
2097060	2101060	I was giggling when Dark Soccer was talking about the pig boops that she was giving out
2101060	2102660	because I booped a pig.
2102660	2107380	That was the first time that I had a pig and not try to kill me and I was able to sneak
2107380	2109700	up and go boop on the snoot and then run out the door.
2109700	2110900	Did you boop a pig and you liked it?
2110900	2111220	I did.
2111220	2114100	I did boop the pig and they could have killed me.
2114100	2117380	They actually knocked me out.
2117380	2119300	Oh, I know why they were mad.
2119300	2121940	They couldn't find me the entire match.
2121940	2126100	The other three died and finally this pig finds me.
2126100	2128340	I'm really good at hiding and being immersed.
2130500	2135620	The pig knocked me out just because they wanted to put a party hat on me, which if you've
2135620	2137700	seen the movie Saw, you know what the party hats are.
2138340	2139780	They're not party hats.
2139780	2141940	Actually, it was only ever on one character.
2141940	2146420	I think it was in the first movie and it was on Amanda.
2146420	2147380	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
2147380	2148340	They use their trap.
2148340	2149780	They use it again later for sure.
2149780	2151140	I don't want to spoil, but I didn't watch.
2151140	2154020	I didn't care about any of this, but I think they only used it like one other time.
2155700	2157700	At least twice that I know of in the canon.
2157700	2163060	It wasn't like I don't think people who don't play Dead by Daylight are going to understand
2163060	2164260	what the party hat is.
2164260	2164980	Oh, yeah.
2164980	2167060	So it's the reverse bear trap thing.
2167060	2174500	So anyway, my point is the pig put that thing on and then allowed me to get out and crawl
2174500	2175620	out or whatever.
2175620	2178980	And then I was able to boop the snoot and run out, which I forgot.
2178980	2180740	I didn't know you could leave the party hat on.
2180740	2183380	I thought you couldn't, but I guess you can after all the gens are done.
2183380	2188740	Yeah, if you get the hat on after the gens are done, you can safely leave or you can
2188740	2190500	leave the hatch with it.
2190500	2192180	Okay, that's why.
2192180	2198020	Which is why, like, the only time I'll ever do it after after gens are done is just for
2198020	2198740	blood points.
2198740	2199540	Got it.
2199540	2200040	Okay.
2200980	2202500	And that was really it for my gaming week.
2202500	2203780	I really have a lot else.
2203780	2209540	So let's get into some gaming news and talk about what is going on around the industry.
2209540	2211460	And we will start with Loki.
2212500	2214580	That game I was thinking of, by the way, was Besiege.
2215380	2217620	That was that was very similar.
2217620	2218120	Okay.
2218680	2224840	Anyways, so here's some good news about Activision Blizzard for change.
2224840	2227240	We're in, you know, backwards world now.
2228520	2232440	Apparently 1100 workers are going to be moved to full time roles.
2232440	2235400	This is their US based QA workers.
2235400	2237640	They are no longer going to be contract employees.
2237640	2241880	They're going to be full time employees with benefits starting July 1st.
2241880	2252920	I'm thinking this is to try to quell additional unions, but good, I guess, because I know
2252920	2259880	the QA workers on as part of Raven had, I believe, try the former union as a big strike.
2259880	2266520	And then, yeah, so but at least you know that the QA employees are going to be moved to
2266520	2267080	full time.
2267080	2272280	They're going to be paid 20 or at minimum, I guess, $20 an hour.
2273400	2273800	Good.
2273800	2275640	Seems kind of low for QA work, but okay.
2278760	2281000	But once again, I think it's just throwing them a bone.
2281000	2285720	I say good because the fact that they're setting that means that doesn't exist now.
2286520	2288120	So it's coming up.
2288120	2289640	They're being paid even less.
2289640	2295640	But on top of all that, though, like probably with a union, you could have got more.
2295640	2299080	But yeah, something is better than nothing.
2300600	2303400	Well, and it's also nice to see the benefits.
2303400	2308840	It's nice to see that a lot of the action that the employees have worked hard with the
2308840	2313560	organization efforts that they have done thus far have resulted in meaningful change.
2314440	2319960	Some may argue how meaningful this is, but it is change in the direction that people
2319960	2320680	wanted to see it.
2320680	2326200	And let's be honest, we would not be talking about this whatsoever right now if employees
2326200	2329320	hadn't taken the first steps to ask for that or to demand that change.
2329960	2332520	So it's just still unionized, though, on top of that.
2332520	2333080	Oh, of course.
2333800	2338680	But you're right that a lot of these things are probably in an effort to prevent that
2338680	2339720	from happening, I guess.
2339720	2347640	But anyhow, let's move on and talk about PlayStation Plus, which I believe we talked
2347640	2351560	a little bit about last week about how it is confirmed there's going to be that whole
2351560	2353640	three tier system for PlayStation Plus.
2354280	2359080	It's basically a lot of PlayStation now that already exists, but now with a lot of retro
2359080	2360680	game, a lot more retro games.
2360680	2363960	And a lot of people are wondering what type of retro games.
2365000	2370440	Well, on the official PlayStation podcast this week, Jim Ryan, the boss of PlayStation,
2370440	2375880	was a guest, as you would expect on the official PlayStation podcast from time to time, and
2375880	2380760	said that subscribers can look forward to, here's the quote, all the big names.
2382280	2387880	So when a question was asked, the reply, quote, massive publisher participation.
2387880	2390040	We have all the big names present.
2390040	2391480	We have big publishers.
2391480	2393240	We have small indie publishers.
2393240	2397960	We have over 200 partners working with us to put their content into PlayStation Plus.
2397960	2399960	So the lineup is going to be really strong.
2400200	2407720	Now, here's the thing, if they're even missing one game, we know the internet people, we
2407720	2411960	know social media people, they are going to fixate on that one game.
2412600	2414120	I know this internet.
2414120	2417480	I've been around this internet for a long time, y'all.
2418440	2421320	And it'll be interesting to see all those Activision games in there.
2422280	2426600	The internet will absolutely fixate on what games are missing.
2427480	2429000	Or are they going to be in there?
2429960	2432600	Oh, Activision?
2432600	2433640	I would assume so.
2434280	2435000	I would assume so.
2435000	2435080	Sure.
2435080	2436600	Because games pass.
2436600	2441480	I would think that'd make it look much more, they'll be on their platform, but maybe not
2441480	2442680	necessarily part of Plus.
2446680	2447640	I think it'll be there.
2448520	2453800	Because it's still some money and it's better than no money, which is what those games are
2453800	2454920	otherwise making.
2454920	2462280	So, but of course, it also is kind of confirmed those games will, or PlayStation Plus, the
2462280	2466280	new version is not going to be first party launches.
2466280	2471400	So whereas Xbox Game Pass has Starfield, Halo Infinite coming out day one, don't expect
2471400	2474360	God of War Ragnarok to come out on PlayStation Plus.
2475160	2480920	In the interview, Jim Ryan said, the games that we make are getting bigger.
2480920	2482120	They're getting better.
2482120	2483560	They're getting more beautiful.
2483560	2484680	They're getting richer.
2484680	2486520	The narrative is getting stronger.
2486520	2491400	Putting these games into a subscription service immediately upon their release would break
2491400	2492840	this virtuous circle.
2492840	2496120	And we wouldn't be able to invest in the way that we're currently able to.
2496120	2497480	So we're not doing it.
2497480	2501400	We're going to stick to the approach that we have and has served us well under many
2501400	2501960	years now.
2502840	2507240	And by they're getting richer, they mean Sony's getting richer because of their $70
2507240	2513160	price point and, you know, games, you know, different season passes and microtransactions
2513160	2516840	and that kind of stuff that they have to walk back later on after it becomes really
2516840	2517320	terrible.
2517320	2520040	You said it with microtransactions, because here's the thing.
2520040	2528120	If this, well, if these games like God of War Ragnarok have non-meaningful DLC in it.
2528120	2533800	And when I say that, I mean, like, non, I mean, DLC that is not an extensive story
2533800	2534600	addition.
2534600	2540520	If it has non-meaningful DLC in it, then that whole statement is bullshit in my opinion.
2540760	2545640	If God of War Ragnarok has a season pass, that's a bullshit statement.
2545640	2548600	Now, because like Gran Turismo, like, for example, it did that.
2550360	2552600	Well, but well, they're paying for it now, aren't they?
2552600	2557160	Because it's that one's pretty much universally lauded as the worst in the series at this
2557160	2557480	point.
2558200	2559240	So there is that.
2561400	2569560	Also, I thought I was going to say with oh, with Microsoft.
2570680	2576520	We see that there are things like, you know, Forza Horizon 4, as brilliant of a game as
2576520	2579400	that is, there is no shortage of DLC in that game.
2580280	2582120	Halo Infinite season pass.
2582920	2587160	So Microsoft does monetize it in other ways.
2587160	2590760	So that's why I'm kind of putting that AMB comparison there.
2590760	2597480	Because again, in Jim Ryan's words, we wouldn't be able to invest in the way that we're
2597480	2598440	currently able to.
2598840	2603960	But it's a season pass for Halo for single player or for multiplayer multiplayer, because
2603960	2604760	multiplayer is free.
2605400	2605720	Right.
2605720	2607960	But then there's season pass for cosmetics on top of that.
2609240	2609880	Well, that makes sense.
2609880	2611720	If it's a free to play game, right?
2611720	2615960	Not a $70 game that Sony is charging for the racing sim.
2617080	2618680	So yeah, no, that's true.
2618680	2623000	So I will be even take something like I don't know, like Forza Horizon 4, or whatever it
2623000	2625160	is, is that Forza Horizon 4 is bad.
2625160	2627160	Yeah, as far as microtransactions.
2628040	2628540	Yeah.
2631400	2631900	Okay.
2633560	2634760	Sorry, I keep Jamie.
2634760	2638040	Jeremy, every time you get up and walk away, it screws up my Discord thing.
2638040	2638600	Sorry.
2638600	2640360	Just are you back?
2641800	2642840	Okay, I don't think she's back.
2642840	2643340	All right.
2644040	2649800	Anyway, Bobby Black Wolf does point out Forza Horizon 5 actually doesn't have any DLC yet.
2649800	2658600	What about the map and all that stuff that isn't in that game?
2660440	2662760	Like the pay to unlock the entire map and all that stuff?
2664760	2665880	Oh, all right.
2665880	2667560	I guess I'm misremembering.
2668120	2669800	I thought there was like cars and stuff.
2671000	2672200	Oh, yeah, the treasure map.
2672200	2673800	Okay, so there's at least something in there.
2675080	2676760	Okay, there's no new car packs yet.
2676760	2677160	All right.
2677160	2677400	All right.
2677400	2678760	That's what the chat is filling me in on.
2678760	2679480	Okay.
2679480	2679880	All right.
2679880	2681000	Anyhow, let's move on.
2681000	2681960	Let's go to our next story.
2681960	2682600	Dark Sakura.
2691480	2692520	I need I need a moment.
2692520	2693000	Sorry.
2693000	2693500	Sure.
2695080	2699320	Let's see if there's other comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
2700920	2701560	Where?
2701560	2704600	Yeah, SJ100 Matt's confirming getting paid to unlock the map.
2705320	2707960	Oh, Mike Deft is bringing up Chocobo GP.
2708680	2709240	Oh, yes.
2709800	2710840	Oh, yeah, that game.
2710840	2714360	But I mean, technically, that game exists in a free to play mode.
2715080	2719880	But they still it's still bad, even on the paid mode or whatever.
2719880	2723720	They still have like a ton of the microtransactions stuff in there.
2724440	2729240	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I still paid $100 for her for horizon five, even though
2729240	2731160	I have game pass, but I'm weird.
2732360	2734520	Yeah, no, it's your money.
2734520	2735720	Spend it on how you want.
2735720	2741000	I think one of the smart things Microsoft did was that whole like three days of early
2741000	2745560	access, because you know, people will pay extra money to be able to play it first.
2745560	2747720	And I think that's they're not the first to do it.
2748520	2753320	We've seen that we've seen that for worse as well on EA side, when they put out like
2753320	2758200	Mass Effect Andromeda early, and just enough in time for people to find all the bugs and
2758200	2759320	shine a light on it.
2759320	2762920	But for Forza Horizon five was ready for prime time.
2762920	2764200	That was the difference.
2764200	2765320	So there was that.
2766680	2767720	Um, okay.
2767720	2770280	Okay, I guess I could talk about this while we wait for Jamie.
2771000	2776120	Pod culture and chat chat says fill time and tell us about the new thing that you and Alan
2776120	2776760	picked up.
2776760	2777720	Okay, I will.
2778440	2787160	Here's the I've been hesitant to talk extensively about it because we are in the process of
2787160	2788520	adopting a cat.
2788520	2791640	So you'll notice I didn't say we adopted a cat.
2791640	2794040	We're in the process of adopting a cat.
2794840	2796920	Because we're doing that whole trial run thing.
2797800	2802760	We did identify a cat who has a very similar story to Mr. Smoosh.
2803880	2805720	And yes, everything's fine with Mr. Smoosh.
2805720	2808680	We've always just wanted to have more than one cat.
2808680	2813400	And now that we have a house with no landlord to tell us how many cats we can and can't
2813400	2813880	have.
2813880	2816840	I mean, we know we should probably limit ourselves.
2816840	2818520	We shouldn't have like 20 cats.
2818600	2820520	I want to that might that might be a problem.
2820520	2821480	But two cats.
2821480	2823160	That's reason two cats is reasonable.
2823160	2827480	I would say three is about the most two is reasonable for me.
2827480	2828520	Everybody's different.
2828520	2829640	I don't run your life.
2829640	2832680	But for us, you know, in this house, two or three is fine.
2833640	2836040	So yes, we are trial running a new cat.
2836040	2837080	His name is cheddar.
2837720	2841800	We didn't name him, but he's a Japanese bobtail cat.
2841800	2848360	So he has more of like a bunny rabbit tail than a full cat tail.
2848520	2855000	So he was called cheddar, because whoever found that cat originally because cheddar
2855000	2856600	is six years old at this point.
2856600	2860520	And that's another reason why we wanted to try to adopt cheddar is because not a lot
2860520	2863080	of people adopt adult cats.
2863080	2865080	But Smoosh is seven or eight.
2865080	2869320	So we wanted to get a cat that was around smoosh his age and he has a real similar story
2870040	2873400	where cheddar was abandoned for my story.
2873400	2875880	Okay, I'll get to you in just a sec because now I'm talking to this other thing.
2875880	2879080	So cheddar, you know, has this story.
2880120	2884760	And so we're trial running to see if cheddar will work out.
2884760	2890360	He's been he's a very shy boy, and he's been very, very shy and skittish.
2890360	2892280	He has not been using the litter box.
2892280	2896200	I think he finally did last night, but he's barely eating or drinking.
2896200	2899880	He's just a scared little boy, or big boy at this point.
2899880	2904200	So I'm hoping soon, we can mix cheddar and smoosh.
2904200	2908920	But, you know, we got to wait for cheddar to get a little more comfortable before we
2908920	2910360	put the stress of another cat.
2910360	2912040	So everybody cross your fingers and toes.
2912040	2914840	Dark soccer got to meet cheddar today because she was by the house.
2914840	2919400	So hopefully, yeah, hopefully everybody likes cheddar.
2919400	2922600	So all right, let's go to the next story dark soccer.
2922600	2932120	So there have been reports of GameStop call, you know, various GameStop stores calling
2932120	2938040	customers and canceling their preorders of the Amico from Intellivision.
2939080	2946120	There's emails and screenshots up and the email reads, Dear so and so, due to vendor
2946120	2950520	cancellation, we will be unable to fulfill your order number, etc.
2950520	2953160	We will be canceling your order and you will not be charged.
2954520	2960920	Also, members of the Intellivision Amico club have been reporting that their orders were
2960920	2961720	also canceled.
2962440	2967560	And the it's a big red flag.
2967560	2976360	And so basically, I think that they're realizing that they weren't getting the investments
2976360	2979480	in it that they needed to have to be able to fulfill the orders.
2981080	2986280	So yeah, it's it's pretty much going to be gone.
2987960	2991560	What's interesting is that and I've made it no secret on this program, I preordered
2991560	2995000	Amico, you know, it was in a very different place two years ago.
2995000	2997320	And it's it's interesting.
2997320	3003080	I I'm not going to be like the biggest Intellivision or Amico defender in this world.
3003080	3007560	But what I find interesting is the massive hate boner people have for Tommy Tallarico
3007560	3009080	and really want to see him fail.
3009800	3013640	Even though he's no longer involved, essentially, at this point, people really want to see him
3013640	3014140	fail.
3014600	3021960	And in my mind, that completely disregards a lot of the independent developers who wanted
3021960	3023240	to make games for this thing.
3024200	3026760	And a lot of you know, that that end of it.
3026760	3033080	And there was a lot of interesting, I think, methodologies into the developments of the
3033080	3037160	games to this console where I wanted to see where it would kind of turn out.
3037720	3039240	And I thought it was going to be interesting.
3039240	3046280	Again, that vision was a lot different in February of 2020 than where we're at now with
3046280	3047560	all that's happened since then.
3048200	3052040	So, you know, I at this point, I assume I'm not seeing my $100.
3052920	3058360	Again, that that here we go again, I should have learned my Kickstarter lesson, I should
3058360	3061960	never back these things ever back these things.
3061960	3066360	And I swear I won't ever again until there is actually a product.
3066360	3069720	No, until there is actually a product on the table.
3069720	3073160	That's why I didn't even back the new Yacht Club Games thing.
3073160	3074920	And I'm sure they'll deliver on that.
3074920	3077720	But I'm just sick and fucking tired of Kickstarter.
3077720	3078840	And things like it.
3078840	3081080	I am sick and fucking tired of it.
3081080	3088040	So like, I'm not going to do any more these things until we actually have like, like,
3088040	3093400	it's got to be for publishing or something where that is what the Kickstarter is backing,
3093400	3095560	that there's an actual finished product ready to go.
3096360	3101480	I'm pissed off that we had somebody on this show that was making a game on Kickstarter.
3101480	3103400	That game still isn't fucking out.
3103400	3106040	I'm not having Kickstarter guests on this show ever again.
3108120	3111720	So I say that and then fast forward to a year from now we have one on.
3111720	3115720	But if it's again, if it's somebody I know, might be different.
3115720	3119000	And somebody again, where there's like publishing and that whole thing.
3119640	3121720	It depends how much of a kickstart they need.
3121720	3124280	I'm willing to consider on a case by case basis.
3124280	3127720	But you know, I think I kind of I've learned my lesson time and time again.
3128680	3133000	I've also been asked, if the amico comes out, will you still want one?
3134120	3135480	Yeah, I do.
3135480	3139400	Because now we're at the point where this is like the 3DO.
3139400	3141640	And it's like, it's going to be a collector's item.
3141640	3143160	So yeah, I want an amico.
3144120	3145800	I just don't think I'm getting one.
3145800	3149880	I have not gotten one of these emails, though, which is and I did not order through GameStop
3149880	3152200	I ordered directly through Intellivision's website.
3152200	3156120	But you even said there a lot of the people in the Intellivision got any I didn't get an email.
3156920	3158520	And I was listening to Bobby's show tonight.
3158520	3159400	And I know he backed it.
3159400	3160600	He didn't get an email either.
3160600	3163720	So there's a weird circle of people that didn't get this.
3163720	3164760	Maybe it's on its way.
3164760	3167880	Maybe next week, I'll be like, well, the email came in, y'all.
3167880	3172200	Um, but it's because they have the date, the release date.
3172200	3172600	I don't know.
3172600	3175960	I'm assuming this placeholder for the 31st of March.
3176520	3181160	And they had a thing where it actually charged people for their preorder.
3181160	3186440	It charged them the full amount because, you know, it was set to come out already.
3186440	3188600	But then the vendor didn't update the date.
3188600	3190760	And I'm guessing they don't have an updated date for it.
3190760	3192760	That's why they're refunding them.
3192760	3197240	Because amico is certainly not refunding people, even if you ask for a refund.
3197240	3203480	So if you have one preordered through other means, stop that payment ASAP, because you're
3203480	3205080	not going to get your money back otherwise.
3205640	3210360	And they're the reason I think people are mad at taught me to go, not necessarily because
3210360	3211480	they just want to see him fail.
3211480	3217080	It's because he's been basically not addressing issues with or concerns that people have and
3217080	3218680	just calling people haters.
3218680	3224920	And also just straight up lying about what the system can do when it's available, what
3224920	3229880	you know, everything just hyping the thing up to a ridiculous point and having nothing
3229880	3230840	to show for it.
3230840	3236680	They just put out an unboxing video to try to secure even more investments right now.
3236680	3241400	Probably, I think there's somebody in Germany that they're trying to secure investments
3241400	3243720	for to make it look like it's an actual product.
3243720	3245720	But this product isn't even a thing.
3245720	3247480	It didn't come off the assembly line.
3247480	3251000	It's a prototype that they've had in their office, but they're passing it off.
3251000	3253400	It's like, look, see, the product's almost ready to go.
3254120	3255720	It's a bunch of bullshit.
3255720	3256440	Here's the thing.
3256440	3257640	That's why people are mad at him.
3257640	3260600	He's and he's not the first carnival barker in this industry.
3260600	3261080	Let's be real.
3261080	3262440	There's a lot of them out there.
3262440	3264120	A lot of carnival barkers in the industry.
3264920	3270440	I think there's a sense of pride with this whole they got screwed by the, you know, the
3270440	3273880	computer chip people, because that's that's the core problem at the end of the day here.
3273880	3274680	No, it's not.
3274680	3275000	You know what?
3275000	3279480	No, what they got screwed by is their stupid idea, their stupid business decisions.
3279480	3284040	They literally have taken out a loan from one of the shareholders.
3284680	3289240	It's one of the people that's on the board where they have in order to pay it back.
3289240	3295480	They have to take $100 off of or they have to take $100 for every unit sold.
3296200	3298440	How are you going to make any profit on a console?
3298440	3300920	Consoles don't have that kind of margin as it is.
3300920	3303160	So that's doomed to failure right there.
3303160	3307800	They're just trying to make the company look, you know, good enough to sell it off is what
3307800	3308840	they're going to do.
3308840	3310520	So it's it's just bad.
3310520	3312280	There's a lot of just bad stuff.
3312280	3315720	I've been following it and it's all bad.
3316280	3317560	There's nothing good from it.
3318200	3322920	Well, but also, you know, again, there were people that were developing for this thing
3322920	3328520	that were like, you know, the people that were making that breakout redo, that is essentially
3328520	3330040	the bit trip gang.
3330040	3334280	You know, they were putting out what looked like a pretty quality product for that console.
3334280	3336040	No matter how you feel about it.
3336040	3340040	That game looks like it was, you know, making the best of it by the way.
3340040	3340920	Oh, did it really?
3340920	3343560	I actually didn't know that platforms already.
3343560	3345720	It's that that's a telltale sign.
3345720	3347000	Slightly different.
3347000	3349960	You know, yeah, that's why that game looked good, because it was already being developed
3349960	3351160	for other platforms.
3351160	3354120	Tommy wanted everything to be exclusive to their platform.
3354120	3358760	But that also could mean that it's an exclusive mode that's in there or something like that.
3358760	3360760	But it would have a certain gameplay option.
3360760	3366680	There was was that was that was the backing down because his his big mouth got him into
3366680	3367800	trouble, right?
3369560	3375320	The moon later game that he had or whatever, their couch co-op mode in that is that each
3375320	3378440	person gets a different button they use to control the thing.
3378440	3381960	So one person may move left, one person may move right, one person may jump, the other
3381960	3383800	person may do something else.
3383800	3384760	That's stupid.
3384760	3386760	It's absolutely dumb like that.
3386760	3390520	That's their big selling point of about this couch co-op and bringing the family together
3390520	3391400	and stuff.
3391400	3394680	And I whatever, none of these games are coming out.
3394680	3396200	I don't even know why we're concerned with stuff.
3396200	3400680	And the fact that they sold these NFT things for games that they know are never going to
3400680	3401720	be released.
3401720	3402760	That's ridiculous.
3402760	3404360	Somebody saw dollar signs in that.
3404680	3408440	That's all this NFT ever is, is that people that's why celebs are getting involved.
3408440	3409560	They just see dollar signs.
3409560	3410200	That's all they see.
3410840	3415240	That was that was an escape hatch for Intellivision to get these funding issues.
3415240	3417800	Oh, people are paying $100,000 for NFTs.
3417800	3419000	Let's get in on that.
3419000	3420680	Like that's that's that's all it is.
3421400	3425960	So anyway, for now, let's move on for more stories.
3426840	3433160	Loki about another gaming company face a boy if you think you think Intellivision has bad
3433160	3436280	owners, try this next was bad.
3436280	3439240	It's like, you know, on the board of a company.
3439240	3443960	How about Mohammed Buzzsaw or Salman?
3443960	3448440	You know, the guy that, you know, murdered people.
3449720	3451480	Allegedly murdered.
3451480	3452360	He murdered people.
3452360	3456360	OK, he killed people, killed, you know, reporters and stuff like that.
3456360	3460920	Well, he owns 96.18% of SNK now.
3461160	3467640	So because he invested in them and so, yeah, so now now when you buy an SNK game, know
3467640	3470280	that the money is going to a goddamn murderer.
3470280	3474120	So how do we feel good about those King of Fighter games?
3474120	3475800	How do we get that to stop?
3475800	3478360	How do we take and I realize the answer is you don't.
3478360	3482280	But I think a lot of people are feeling some type of way because, you know, we also have
3482280	3487000	that news about Elon Musk buying, you know, his a stake of Twitter and buying a seat on
3487000	3487960	the board, essentially.
3488200	3492520	And look, I'm not trying to necessarily equate those two people, but the reality is it's
3492520	3494520	on a lot of people's mind as well this week.
3494520	3496920	And I think a lot of people are like, how can we stop that from happening?
3496920	3498120	And most people are like, you can't.
3499080	3504600	And it just seems weird, like that you can't stop him from coming in and taking over that
3504600	3507720	much of the company where now it just feels like dirty.
3507720	3508520	You know what I mean?
3510600	3511800	Yeah, I just.
3513240	3515880	But as nothing you can do, SSG 100.
3515880	3516680	SSG 100.
3516680	3522280	Matt wants to point out, you know, before everybody starts protesting and the whole
3523080	3527880	basically lending itself to it is you really can't be an ethical consumer in a capitalist
3527880	3530360	society is really what it is as to 100.
3530360	3535800	Matt says he sadly owns a lot of minority shares of many companies, banks, airlines,
3535800	3536300	etc.
3539240	3540760	But who's going to hold him accountable?
3543160	3544040	Nobody, nobody.
3544920	3548120	And that's that's that's what gets very frustrating about this world sometimes.
3549720	3554920	Anyway, let's try to move on to happier news and things that maybe, you know, we can we
3554920	3559480	can we can wrap ourselves in a little blanket and feel better about these types of news
3559480	3561480	for what they're worth.
3561480	3564520	And that is return to Monkey Island.
3564520	3567720	Yes, it's a thing that's absolutely want to return to Monkey Island.
3567720	3570200	It's it's not just an April Fool's joke.
3570200	3571640	And it's by Ron Gilbert.
3571880	3577400	I Ron Gilbert is indeed working on a new entry called Return to Monkey Island.
3577400	3578600	It's going to come out this year.
3578600	3580840	There is a new trailer available on YouTube.
3581640	3587800	It is a follow up to Monkey the Secret Monkey Island and Monkey Island to Le Chunk's Le
3587800	3589480	Chunk Le Chuck's Revenge.
3590200	3591720	Le Chunk was from the Goonies.
3591720	3592220	Sorry.
3593640	3596920	So I guess this is Monkey Island three in some ways.
3598120	3600200	Terrible Toy Box is making this game.
3600200	3604440	They made Thimbleweed Park for those that know that one, which was a great.
3604440	3607400	Yeah, that was like a giveaway on Epic Game Store and stuff.
3607400	3608200	Not that long ago.
3609080	3615400	Also, Rex Crowl, who did design with games like Tearaway and Little Big Planet.
3615400	3616360	That's a pretty good name.
3617160	3618680	That's he's the art director.
3618680	3620040	So that's going to be pretty exciting.
3620680	3621240	It's good.
3621240	3621480	Yeah.
3621480	3624680	Otherwise, we don't know a whole lot more about it.
3624680	3626360	That's pretty much all we know at this time.
3626360	3630440	But this is this also has nothing to do with because Telltale did a Monkey Island game
3630440	3632520	like they did a reboot of the first game a while ago.
3632520	3632680	Right.
3632680	3635880	But this is not this has nothing to do with any of that.
3635880	3640680	So this is a new a new game from the Thimbleweed Park folks.
3641320	3645000	They are collaborating with Lucasfilm Games, a Disney company.
3647160	3651000	I don't think Lucasfilm actually has their own development studio at this point.
3651000	3652680	No, it's like a holdings thing at this point.
3652680	3653720	It's licensing.
3653720	3654040	Yeah.
3654040	3654440	Yeah.
3654440	3658840	As 100 Matt points out, they're also getting the voice cast from the previous games.
3658840	3659640	That's pretty cool.
3660200	3666360	That's that is like literally like the 90s television reboot, like the X Files coming
3666360	3669720	back for another season or Roseanne.
3669720	3671960	But then Roseanne's a monster.
3671960	3677400	So it's the Connors comes back for a new season and all these and all the game shows.
3677400	3680120	Press Your Luck is back and all these game shows coming back.
3680120	3682440	It's like the video game version of that.
3682440	3685640	And they're getting the band all back together to do the voices.
3685640	3686440	So that's pretty cool.
3686440	3690920	We get another Maniac Mansion game because I'd like to see another Maniac Mansion game.
3690920	3691880	It's all about the money.
3692520	3696280	Bobby Black Wolf points out he's bringing in characters from the later Monkey Island
3696280	3697640	games that he didn't do.
3698280	3701640	So he's not honoring their story, but he's honoring the characters.
3701640	3710120	That reminds me of the Blaster Master Zero franchise making that character from the FX
3710120	3714600	Nine books canon to the series.
3714600	3719400	Eve is canon to the series based on those books that hardly anybody read.
3719400	3720440	But yeah, anyway.
3721000	3723960	So yeah, it's still it's still it's exciting that it's coming back.
3723960	3724840	So that'd be nice.
3725480	3726040	All right.
3726040	3728040	Maybe something exciting for the future up next.
3728040	3728680	Dark Sakura?
3732760	3736040	I swear every time I try to unmute, it mutes itself right back again.
3736920	3745320	Um, so the director of Sonic 2, basically his name is Jeff Fowler.
3745320	3751640	He's gone on record saying that he would love to do a Smash Brothers movie.
3752520	3757320	The quote is nothing would make me happier than to throw all the characters into a battle
3757320	3759880	royale, getting Mario and Sonic in the ring.
3759880	3762520	I mean, everyone would be kind of dying for that, right?
3762520	3763240	It's a classic.
3764200	3769000	So and I mean, in that game, though, would touch so many different franchises that I
3769000	3773000	think the licensing would be very difficult because it's not just Nintendo.
3773000	3779160	We have Namco, we have Capcom, we have all kinds of of areas.
3779160	3781320	I just don't know how something like that would work.
3781320	3785240	Or they could go like early Smash Brothers and just throw Sonic in there.
3785240	3785960	Yes.
3785960	3787800	You know, that way they don't license too much.
3787800	3788920	It's all Nintendo, really.
3789640	3792040	Yeah, but still, I don't know.
3792600	3793800	I don't know how they make this.
3794360	3795800	The story works fine for a game.
3795800	3797880	I don't know that it would work well for a movie.
3797880	3801720	Bobby does point out Wreck-It Ralph did the multiple license thing pretty well.
3802520	3807320	But it didn't showcase they were mostly background people.
3809320	3814600	Yeah, everyone who was a main character was effectively someone new.
3815240	3821000	I think this is one of those weird fan expectations that shouldn't exist in reality.
3821240	3826520	It seems very disconnected from the reality of how movies get financed and all that stuff.
3826520	3827880	Like, I'm just being honest.
3828440	3833000	Sure, as a video gaming fan, the idea of a Super Smash Brothers movie and all those characters
3833000	3834840	on screen is awesome.
3834840	3840120	But the reality is, A, I don't see where the plot comes from.
3840840	3849240	B, I feel like getting all those characters together in one place is going to be too expensive
3849320	3851240	for the type of movie that you're going to get.
3851880	3855080	S200 Matt says Rob is ruining everyone's fanfic dreams.
3855080	3855960	That's what I do here.
3857080	3857960	It is what it is.
3857960	3864120	Like, I think we should just all focus on right now, hoping that the Mario movie is
3864120	3870520	going to be really good, despite whatever reservations I have about the voice actors.
3870520	3871020	Yeah.
3871800	3875240	And the Sonic movies have been well received, whether you like them or not.
3876040	3877640	At the end of the day, they made money.
3877640	3879080	That's what it's about.
3879080	3880120	Detective Pikachu.
3880120	3881160	It made money, right?
3881160	3882840	They're going to make another one, if I remember right.
3882840	3884120	So there you got that.
3884120	3887800	If the Mario movie does well, you know, like, that's that's got to be the first step.
3887800	3892440	These movies have to make quite a bit of money, and then maybe we'll cross that bridge.
3892440	3899080	But I feel like if the Mario movie does well, it's going to lend itself to the Donkey
3899080	3901960	Kong movie and Donkey Kong Country in that.
3901960	3903080	And I, I just-
3903080	3905320	Donkey Kong is supposed to be in that movie.
3905320	3910280	I know, but there's all the rumors about they're setting it up for a spinoff intentionally.
3910280	3915480	So I think Nintendo kind of has to, like, live that out for a little bit before it's
3915480	3918920	going to be, okay, call Sega and let's get Sonic.
3918920	3922840	Call, you know, Konami and let's get Snake and all this other stuff.
3922840	3929080	I just, I feel like Nintendo, Nintendo is getting back into movies after a very long
3929080	3929580	absence.
3929580	3935260	But I think the success of Sonic, again, whether you like it or not, it made money.
3936060	3941740	The success of Sonic is going to lend itself well to Mario, because I think you're going
3941740	3947500	to have that audience of people that grew up with Mario taking their kids who also are
3947500	3948620	growing up with Mario.
3949420	3951100	And that's why that movie will do well.
3951900	3953100	So we'll see.
3954060	3959340	Esther shown her mat says people are writing in Ryan Reynolds Detective Pikachu fighting
3959340	3962700	Chris Pratt Mario and Seth Rogen DK.
3962700	3965340	Okay, what fanfic ever got made into a movie?
3965340	3969580	Of course, as those words leave my leave my mouth now I'm going Oh fuck, there was 50
3969580	3970460	shades of gray.
3970460	3972460	That movie literally ruined everything.
3972460	3974620	That movie literally ruined everything.
3975180	3977340	So it's like, what fanfic became a movie?
3977340	3979580	Oh, oh, that.
3979580	3980080	Right.
3980940	3981440	Right.
3983340	3986300	Anyway, all right, moving on, Loki.
3987820	3988700	All right.
3988700	3995420	So, you know, we talked a little bit about some previous goes recon games with break
3995420	3997420	point and their whole NFT thing.
3997420	4000460	Well, break point wasn't all that great.
4000460	4007020	And now Ubisoft is ending their updates for break point and its live service plans.
4008780	4012700	Once again, you know, all these companies pushing for live service games, and then they
4012700	4015020	just quit on them after a short period of time.
4017100	4020220	Don't get too invested in them, especially with NFTs.
4020220	4022300	Because now those entities are worth what nothing.
4023180	4023820	It's like that.
4023820	4028540	I mean, with that racing game that closed down this last week to had a bunch of stuff
4028540	4028860	in it.
4028860	4032380	And now it's, you know, granted that nice fucking trash.
4033660	4037100	But like, it's, it's, you know, what, what's the point of it?
4037100	4041340	Am I going to be able to use my NFT helmet in this next goes recon game they put out?
4041660	4044140	No, probably not.
4045420	4045740	Cool.
4046380	4048300	Glad you really dived in the NFTs.
4049660	4052300	So yeah, it's going to be was it I think.
4053580	4058460	Yeah, the both says they're going to continue to maintain the service for both goes recon
4058460	4060220	wild land and break point.
4062140	4064300	But they're gonna not be updating it.
4064300	4071500	So, oh, Bobby says there are five movies based on fanfics.
4071500	4072060	Really?
4072060	4072700	What are the other?
4072700	4077180	Okay, well, there were three movies in the 50 shades of gray.
4077180	4078140	So what are the other two?
4082380	4088220	I'm curious what the other two are as soon as Matt says Ubisoft is trying to find new
4088220	4092620	decimals to support NFTs, because they're already double, triple and quadruple down
4092620	4093340	on NFTs.
4093900	4096540	Mortal Instruments is a Harry Potter fanfic.
4096540	4097020	Really?
4097020	4097980	What's Mortal Instruments?
4097980	4098700	I've never heard of it.
4098700	4104060	That's the one with the the like cities that are on wheels that are like driving around
4104060	4104940	and fighting each other.
4106300	4111180	Pixel pocket says a one direction one and Bobby Blackwell says it's called after that
4111180	4113660	a one direction fanfic got turned into a movie really?
4114460	4115020	Here's the thing.
4115820	4119820	There's any of my fanfics get turned into movies or books there.
4119820	4121740	There's there's the right people, I guess.
4121740	4123900	A fanfic and then there's okay, okay.
4123900	4125980	Was Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter?
4125980	4127020	Was that a fanfic?
4128140	4129340	Technically, that's a fanfic.
4129340	4131180	Because I feel like it was.
4131180	4133980	Pride and Prejudice and Zombies really was.
4133980	4134860	I guess that's true.
4134860	4136300	I guess you guys are right.
4136300	4141180	There's those what they're so fucking ludicrous that they kind of have to get made.
4141180	4142540	So I guess there's that.
4142540	4143500	That should be a movie.
4143500	4145420	So fucking ludicrous starring ludicrous.
4145500	4150060	And then it should have co-star Raven.
4150780	4151660	Because she's so Raven.
4153020	4153520	Yeah.
4154220	4156220	All right, moving on.
4157260	4158780	Let's talk about Pac-Land.
4158780	4160060	This is ludicrous, too.
4160060	4161660	I don't understand this.
4161660	4162220	Well, I do.
4162220	4163020	I completely do.
4163020	4164700	But it's just it's weird.
4164700	4166700	So arcade archives, right?
4166700	4167740	There's like a lot of games.
4167740	4169580	There's over 100 games in that series.
4169580	4174780	That is a lot of the ports for of classic arcade games for PlayStation.
4175500	4179020	And not Xbox for some reason, but Nintendo Switch as well.
4179580	4184060	So Pac-Land recently came out on Arcade Archives.
4184060	4185820	It came out on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
4186860	4190780	Pac-Land, which, funny enough, we referenced on the show last week.
4190780	4195420	We're not intending to be the official Pac-Land podcast, but sometimes it happens.
4195420	4200140	But I believe last week, Dark Sakura was talking about Mappy Land because it was just coming
4200140	4201820	out on Nintendo Switch online.
4201820	4206620	And it kind of led to a conversation about that weird era of Namco and their land games,
4206620	4207980	which includes Pac-Land.
4208540	4210860	So it's the side scrolling Pac-Man game.
4211980	4216300	I'm going to say something that my co-host may not agree with, but it wasn't very good,
4217020	4218220	in my opinion.
4218220	4219020	It wasn't good.
4219020	4219820	I played it.
4219820	4221020	It was different.
4221020	4221820	It was different.
4221820	4223020	And that's what a lot of people remember.
4223020	4228380	And it was, I think what a lot of people liked about it was that it looked very cartoony,
4228700	4232860	and that was in that era where it was like, oh, it almost looks like a playable cartoon,
4232860	4234940	like not like Dragon.
4234940	4238620	I almost said Dragon Age, Dragon's Lair style playable cartoon.
4238620	4242540	But you know, like the games of that era.
4242540	4243820	Anyway, here's the thing.
4243820	4246540	So Pac-Land did come out in 1984.
4246540	4252700	And it also should be pointed out, it was based off the animated show from the 80s,
4252700	4255340	the Hanna-Barbera Pac-Man show that was on for a little while.
4255900	4261740	And in the very beginning of the game, you basically see where Pac-Man is leaving home
4261740	4265740	and waves goodbye to Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Baby or Baby Pac-Man.
4266300	4267020	Well, guess what?
4268460	4273740	Ms. Pac-Man is not in this Arcade Archives reboot.
4274700	4282540	Now there is a character called Pac-Mom who has like a pink ponytail instead of the red
4282540	4287660	bow, and Baby Pac-Man has been replaced with an unnamed character as well.
4287660	4292060	Pac-Mom comes from Pac-Man Museum Plus.
4292060	4292940	Here's the thing.
4293740	4300380	There is apparently a little bit of legal drama going on behind the scenes because Bandai
4300380	4305180	Namco still owns the Ms. Pac-Man property and can use Ms. Pac-Man wherever they want.
4305740	4311980	But every time the depiction is used, a royalty is paid out to AT Games because they have
4311980	4315980	a percentage of the royalty rights for Ms. Pac-Man every time she appears.
4316780	4322700	So Bandai Namco, not really liking this deal, decided to change the character so they don't
4322700	4324540	have to pay AT Games shit.
4325740	4331980	And it's interesting because there is a Pac-Man Museum Plus that's on its way out and Ms.
4331980	4333020	Pac-Man's not in it.
4333020	4335900	Apparently Pac-Mom is in it though, somewhere in the museum.
4335900	4338220	I don't know if it's the Pac-Lam thing or whatever.
4338220	4343020	So this is just very interesting where the character's been essentially erased due to
4343020	4343980	legal reasons.
4343980	4346540	Although anybody looking at these screenshots...
4346540	4349420	And let me see if I can post the link to this tweet on...
4350620	4351260	Gosh darn.
4352220	4354860	Let me see if I can get this Twitter link here.
4355820	4361660	Sorry everyone for the bad audio there.
4361660	4362460	Okay, I got the link.
4362460	4364300	I'm going to paste this in our chat.
4364300	4365740	And it's somebody's Twitter account.
4365820	4370620	And for the podcast listeners, Nick is on line T, all one word.
4370620	4378300	And they wrote a tweet on April 6th that shows the Pac-Mom and Ms. Pac-Man side by side.
4378300	4382060	Pixel Paca's suggesting Pac-Mam as a possible name.
4383180	4383900	Sure, whatever.
4383900	4386460	But this is what they ended up calling her.
4386460	4388380	Legally distinct Pac-Mom.
4388380	4395500	Yeah, legally distinctly different Pac-Mom who had her bow replaced with a very Karen
4395500	4396220	ponytail.
4396220	4398860	Pat Karen is what she kind of looks like to me, to be honest.
4398860	4400380	Karen doesn't have a ponytail.
4401100	4403100	Karen has that weird wedge haircut.
4403100	4403600	Yeah.
4404220	4405980	So anyway.
4407900	4408380	Let's see.
4409500	4413340	Bobby Black Wolf says Ms. Pac-Man was the one that was made by that other company that
4413340	4416140	modded Pac-Man arcade machines in the early 80s, right?
4416140	4418540	I saw it on the Netflix high score documentary.
4418540	4422460	Yeah, Ms. Pac-Man all started as a mod for the original Pac-Man machines because they
4422460	4424380	weren't coming out with something fast enough for that.
4424380	4429180	That's where I'm like pack plus or whatever was came out of that whole thing, too.
4429180	4430620	So it's interesting.
4430620	4434380	So but also this is why arcade went up machines.
4434380	4437020	A lot of the newer ones, I think one of them has Ms.
4437020	4440460	Pac-Man in it, but most of the collections don't have Ms.
4440460	4440960	Pac-Man.
4441660	4443500	I think one of the first does.
4443500	4445740	But like now these Namco collections, they don't have Ms.
4445740	4446240	Pac-Man.
4446700	4451020	They'll they'll they fall back on Super Pac-Man, which I enjoyed.
4451020	4454220	But a lot of people do not think it holds a candle to the original.
4454220	4454860	It's different.
4454860	4455580	Great.
4455580	4456080	It's different.
4456860	4458300	It's just a different challenge.
4458300	4459580	Yeah, it's a different challenge.
4459580	4461420	So anyway.
4462780	4463180	All right.
4463180	4466700	So that is that is interesting with Pac-Land.
4468060	4471340	I still am interested in that museum plus thing that's coming out.
4471340	4472620	I think that's kind of interesting.
4473660	4480860	But yeah, anyway, let's get to discussion on another classic game in this.
4480940	4481420	Segment.
4492140	4497580	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4497580	4499900	out a classic and tell you about it.
4499900	4502540	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4503740	4505980	And what did you pick for us this week, Dark Sakura?
4507420	4508540	I picked Fatal Frame.
4509420	4512940	Which I actually haven't played and I really should.
4513500	4514060	Oh, really?
4515260	4517900	In Japan, the game is known as Zero.
4519180	4524700	And in Europe, it was called Project Zero.
4524700	4528540	It's a survival horror game that was made by Tecmo for PS2.
4529420	4534940	The game was released on December 13th, 2001.
4535980	4538140	It was the first in the series.
4538940	4542540	And in North America, it came out in 2002.
4542540	4547020	There is an enhanced port on Xbox that came out in PlayStation 2 in North America and
4547020	4549100	2003 in Japan and Europe.
4551820	4558380	So as far as publishing, it was published by Tecmo in both Japan and North America.
4558380	4565180	And in Europe, it was done by Wannadu and then for the Xbox versions by Microsoft.
4565180	4568780	And then there was a re-release in North America for PlayStation Network in 2013.
4569420	4576460	So it's set in 1986 and it follows these two siblings named Miku and Mahuyu Hinasaki.
4577580	4584140	Mahuyu disappears looking for a novelist in the haunted mansion called Himuro Mansion.
4584140	4586220	And so Miku goes to find him.
4586940	4594700	And so through the course of the game, she acquires a camera referred to as the camera
4594700	4606940	Obscura and uses her own sixth sense to locate ghosts and sometimes capture the most
4606940	4608460	volatile of ghosts.
4610220	4615580	And it has an interesting control mechanism because when you use the camera, it switches
4615580	4619900	to first person and then you move it with your right analog stick and the character
4619900	4621020	can move with the left stick.
4621020	4622860	So it's sort of like this weird strafing thing.
4623660	4630140	And the film is your ammo, which of course you find it all over the mansion and can replenish.
4632220	4638940	So basically the siblings have this special ability to see supernatural events.
4640700	4649820	And so when Mahuyu disappears looking for his tutor, who is Takamine Junsei, Miku goes
4649820	4654380	to find him, like I said, and then she finds that Takamine's party was killed by the ghosts
4655020	4658380	and finds rope burns appearing on her wrists and ankles.
4658940	4663740	And it turns out that there was a ritual that happened with a particular miko or a shrine
4663740	4669100	maiden torn apart using the ropes attached to her limbs in a strangling ritual.
4669740	4671420	Yeah, it's pretty, pretty brutal.
4671420	4679500	And so you learn more about the game by going through it.
4680460	4687500	And according to the staff of the game, the first ending is canon and leads to the events
4687500	4688860	in the third game.
4690940	4700620	So the game, the concept of the game came to the director, Shibata Makoto, after they
4700620	4704780	finished working on Tecmo's Deception Invitation to Darkness.
4706220	4711420	He kind of got it in one of his own dreams and different encounters he thought were supernatural.
4711420	4718540	And so when development started on PlayStation 2 hardware, when Tecmo got a hold of it,
4718540	4721020	it went under the name Project Zero.
4722540	4727900	He also had some influence by how positively the characters in Silent Hill were received.
4728860	4734380	And wanted to go further and create the sense of seeing things that were off screen
4734940	4738940	and to create a frightening atmosphere, one as scary as possible.
4740700	4745740	And the key colors were black and white with white representing hope and black representing fear.
4746540	4749580	And they put a lot of that into the clothing and the shading.
4750220	4759100	And then the third color in it was the red that Miku wore and she represented life.
4759820	4767500	And then they put a lot of effort into focusing on stereophonic sound to reinforce the atmosphere
4767500	4772700	of the game to give it a more three-dimensional feeling as they were going along through it.
4773340	4780380	They used different motifs of spirituality.
4780940	4786380	They wanted to give a feeling of isolation through the lack of the modern technology,
4786380	4793020	such as mobile phones and things like that.
4793500	4804780	So, I mean, I think that it's a very interesting concept.
4806060	4812460	Famitsu really was happy with the use of the camera Obscura with the additional tension,
4813340	4815180	including with the visual design.
4815180	4817900	The game was pretty well received.
4818700	4823580	And then, of course, there was a sequel Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Butterfly
4824300	4826460	and then Fatal Frame 3 The Tormented.
4827340	4831820	And then they announced a Hollywood adaptation in 2003.
4833020	4833980	Oh, that's right.
4833980	4841420	But it was under a long hiatus and then re-announced for 2014 with a production.
4842380	4848460	It says set to begin production after the completion and released a Fatal Frame
4848460	4849420	made in the Blackwater.
4851340	4852300	Interesting.
4852300	4854460	That'd be interesting if they ever really do make a movie out of this.
4855820	4857420	Fatal Frame, classic game of the week.
4857420	4862780	I'm reading some comments from chat here because Jason, our voiceover sir,
4862780	4865020	has a lot to say here in chat about the series.
4865020	4869820	And this definitely seems like one of those games where those that have played it have a lot of
4870700	4871740	connection to it.
4871740	4873260	I think it's a cult game in that way.
4873260	4877980	Not like cult, like we're going to drink Kool-Aid or whatever.
4877980	4879020	I'm talking like cult-like.
4879020	4880540	It's just like one of those.
4880540	4882780	If you played this, you know why it's cool.
4883900	4889340	Jason says, Fatal Frame holds a special place in my heart, by which I mean a scarred portion
4889340	4889900	of my brain.
4891100	4895340	Fatal Frame was a catalyst for many years of utter fear and paranoia in my life from
4895340	4897820	about 2002 to 2007.
4897820	4901180	After playing through and beating one to three, I got a lot of closure.
4901180	4904700	I didn't kick all my fear, but it came down from being a paranoia.
4904700	4905900	It is a great game.
4905900	4910540	One to three, make a great series, assuming you are not particularly susceptible to paranormal
4910540	4911340	fears.
4911340	4913580	I love the game immensely.
4913580	4914940	And then, uh, yeah.
4914940	4916780	Jason says it's a cult classic.
4916780	4921420	One may even call it an occult classic, but, um, all right.
4921420	4922140	So there it is.
4922140	4925980	Well, I mean, it, it got some really good scores.
4925980	4932780	I mean, um, Famitsu gave it a 32 out of 40 for PS2, which is pretty good for Famitsu.
4934220	4937500	There were places that were like in the sevens to eights.
4937500	4940300	Eurogamer gave it a nine out of 10 for PS2.
4940940	4947580	Um, I'd say it pretty, it got above average responses, but, um, the big thing that people
4947580	4952540	liked in the Xbox ports were the improved textures and expanded features.
4953340	4964140	Um, especially, um, that those improvements were, were more of something that smooths
4964140	4966700	it over without making a substantial change to the game.
4968540	4968860	All right.
4970140	4974620	Well, Fatal Frame, your classic game of the week and a good choice.
4974620	4977980	That's one, um, that's one I want to go back and revisit.
4977980	4980460	In fact, I don't even know if I don't think I played that.
4980460	4982940	I think I watched someone else play that game.
4982940	4984460	I think that's how that went for me.
4984460	4987340	It was, uh, I, uh, watched somebody else play it.
4987340	4988620	So, uh, yeah.
4989340	4991180	Anyway, there it is.
4992300	4993100	All right.
4993100	4993740	Moving on.
4993740	4995100	Um, I don't know why, I'm sorry.
4995100	4996940	I lost the video of my co-host.
4996940	4997660	Sorry, folks.
4997660	4999420	I don't know why that happened.
4999420	5001420	Um, but I will try to get them back here.
5001420	5001980	There we go.
5001980	5002460	Much better.
5002460	5002940	Sorry about that.
5003500	5008780	The joys of recording live and trying to manage a video while managing audio.
5008780	5009100	All right.
5010460	5013500	I need, I now, now I'm convinced I need a third monitor.
5014140	5017740	Like two, two isn't enough for me to do this show somewhere.
5017740	5018300	Really?
5018300	5019420	I might take you up on it.
5019420	5023180	If you're, cause I could use, I could use a third up here just for B roll stuff.
5023180	5024780	Like that would be fantastic.
5024780	5025260	I'll see.
5025260	5028220	But honestly enough, you should invest in a wide screen monitor.
5028220	5028780	Like I've got.
5029420	5031100	Yeah, those are pretty cool.
5031100	5033500	Um, they're not too expensive either.
5033500	5033820	Yeah.
5033820	5036060	I love the idea though of like an output.
5036060	5038860	That's just like, you, you see exactly what it's going to look like.
5038860	5039820	You're just capturing the screen.
5039900	5042380	There's a part of me that just kind of like that, but you can kind of.
5042380	5045020	I need to start using my iPad for my chat.
5045020	5045740	Yeah.
5045740	5046300	Yeah.
5046300	5047100	Use the sidecar.
5047900	5048380	Sidecar.
5049100	5049420	All right.
5050300	5051740	I think it's a fun name.
5051740	5052620	No, it is a cute name.
5052620	5053260	I do like it.
5053260	5053980	All right.
5053980	5059260	Let's travel around the world quickly, uh, with some other quick news stories and some
5059260	5060700	rapid via news.
5060700	5061340	So Loki.
5062380	5062860	Yeah.
5062860	5069420	So Criterion has given us an update on their new need for speed game, which they had originally
5069420	5071580	announced back in 2020.
5072140	5079340	Um, but that should be coming out this November on PlayStation five and the Xbox series X and S.
5079980	5082620	I'm all about a new Criterion racing game.
5082620	5086220	I wish it was burnout though, but need for speed.
5086220	5090540	I guess we'll have to wait and see what that looks like, but I'd prefer it was burnout.
5091500	5093820	Um, like you're crashing stuff.
5094780	5096460	Yeah, it's just burnout.
5096460	5097900	Like me for speed is a classic.
5098540	5105100	Um, Square Enix says that they have no plans on a sequel for Chrono Cross.
5105820	5110060	Uh, basically saying that, listen, uh, there are no plans for a sequel or a new title now,
5110060	5112220	but who knows what the future holds.
5113980	5116380	So that doesn't mean you won't get one for Chrono Trigger.
5118380	5119820	Cross was the sequel to Chrono Trigger.
5119820	5124940	No, I know it was, or, well, is it considered a sequel or is it considered, I thought it
5125900	5128460	was just considered like, um, I don't know.
5128460	5131500	Like it's got Luca and everyone in it.
5131500	5132460	Yeah, I guess that's true.
5134060	5136940	I was trying to think like, like how shock treatment is a sequel to Rocky Horror.
5136940	5139020	Cause it has Brad and Janet, but it's not really a sequel.
5139020	5139500	You know what I mean?
5139500	5141020	Like it's one of those types of things.
5141020	5142460	So I think so.
5142460	5142960	Yeah.
5143340	5144860	But what, what didn't they plan?
5144860	5146620	Wasn't there another, wasn't there a chrono?
5148540	5152940	There was a third chrono game that was planned at some point, but I forget what it was called.
5152940	5153980	Um, but yeah, it'd be interesting.
5153980	5154480	You never know.
5155020	5155520	Anyway.
5155740	5157420	Uh, let's move on to our soccer.
5158700	5161820	Um, on the 12th, uh, sorry, I'm looking at the wrong thing.
5162620	5167100	Um, so Mario golf is coming to switch online's expansion pack.
5167740	5171580	And for people who care about playing Mario golf.
5171580	5172080	Cool.
5173660	5174700	Congrats to you.
5174700	5175580	64 game.
5175580	5177180	And then a 10 to 64 game.
5177180	5178620	Oh, yep.
5179500	5182220	Um, and then Metroid Dread has had an update.
5182220	5184620	It is version 2.1.0.
5184620	5186700	It adds, uh, some new modes.
5187260	5193020	Including boss rush, where you fight, uh, 12 continuous boss battles and aim for the best time.
5193820	5195740	Damage is carried over into the next fight.
5195740	5197740	Although weapons are fully restored.
5198380	5203580	If a Samus is defeated, you can retry to continue playing from the start of the battle that you lost,
5203580	5205500	but there is a time penalty for being defeated.
5206060	5211340	And then the bosses fought in the boss rush can be fought one on one anytime by selecting practice.
5211340	5215340	There's also survival rush, where you see how many bosses you can defeat inside of a
5215340	5216220	five minute limit.
5217100	5220860	You have dread rush, which is like boss rush, but if you're hit by a boss,
5220860	5223500	your energy drops to zero and you are defeated.
5223500	5225260	So it's like be perfect.
5225820	5230620	And then it fixed, um, an error where the game over screen would not display properly.
5230620	5234620	When Samus takes damage and is defeated immediately after destroying a central unit.
5236940	5238780	I need to go back and revisit Metroid Dread.
5238780	5242940	I think it's one of those games where I just, the, the wrist problems I was having playing
5242940	5245260	it left a really sour taste in my mouth.
5245260	5246780	I need to go back and give it another shot.
5246780	5248300	And I think it's the fault of the game though.
5248860	5253180	It's not, but like the reality is I'm still gonna, you're still gonna, you get that Pavlov,
5253180	5256060	Pavlov's bell response, you know, whether it's the game's fault or not,
5256060	5259340	it's still one of those things where I just associate the risk pain of playing the game.
5259340	5263900	So I'm hoping that maybe I'm going to go back and revisit it and maybe I'll just use different
5263900	5267340	controller that won't, um, have that same effect probably.
5267340	5274220	So speaking of controllers, um, we just got like the two of the SNES controllers
5274220	5276060	and a Genesis controller for switch.
5276060	5276560	Oh yeah.
5277420	5277740	Yeah.
5277740	5281820	Maybe something like that that is a little bit more, I don't know, old school.
5281820	5282460	Yeah, maybe.
5282460	5284940	Or I just, I just need to play maybe with the joy cons.
5284940	5285340	I don't know.
5285340	5287500	Or just maybe not be in the same posture.
5287500	5290140	I was living in a different place back then and had a completely different setup.
5290140	5291740	So maybe that's all I needed, you know?
5291740	5294220	So, or not don't stream at this time.
5294220	5296940	Cause that also changes my posture and probably not for the better.
5297500	5301340	So pretty atrocious stream posture.
5301340	5301840	Yeah.
5301980	5302300	Yeah.
5302300	5304860	And I've, I've found I've not been streaming as much and I don't know.
5304860	5305660	I gotta be honest.
5305660	5306540	I don't know what it is.
5306540	5307500	I need to get back into it.
5307500	5312380	I have project ideas stewing in my mind, but, um, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't mean
5312380	5313740	shit until I put it on paper.
5313740	5319900	So I also need to talk to you about something with another streamer slash podcaster for
5319900	5320620	later.
5320620	5321580	Yeah, I'd be interested.
5321580	5322080	All right.
5322460	5325980	Anyway, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and, and
5325980	5329660	things that'll come sooner than any of those projects, because these are this week.
5329660	5331900	So let's talk about release dates in the U S Loki.
5332620	5334540	And let's remember it is April.
5334540	5336220	So don't expect much.
5336220	5345180	Uh, we've got, we've got, uh, 13 sentinels, uh, GS rim on Nintendo switch.
5346140	5352140	Uh, nobody saves the world on an intense switch PlayStation four and PlayStation five and
5352140	5354700	tormented souls on Nintendo switch.
5355580	5360220	That's it going to the Nintendo switch in Japan and checking out the releases this week.
5360220	5362380	Uh, very similar to what Loki was saying.
5362380	5366460	Cause that 13 sentinels ages rim is also out in Japan this week on the 12th.
5366460	5371180	And then on the 14th, you have battle spirits, connected battles, skull, the hero slayer
5371180	5375900	in a regular and deluxe edition, uh, and the Smurfs mission belief.
5376540	5378220	That is an actual game that's coming out.
5378940	5382780	I have no, is, does it, is there a movie or something that I'm unaware of?
5382780	5384300	No, it looks like it's based on the cartoon.
5384300	5385020	Interesting.
5385020	5389900	I'm sure that was released here and can't imagine it wasn't on my radar, but it wasn't
5389900	5391580	now here's the game.
5392140	5393100	That's important.
5393100	5397420	That's out on the switch this week, winning post nine 2022.
5397420	5397900	That's right.
5397900	5400140	Horse racing back on the switch this week.
5400140	5405500	And this is a lovely idea of a, uh, a concept of a game that probably isn't coming out here.
5405500	5409180	I think some of those winning post games maybe have seen the light of day over here,
5409180	5412140	but this one won't very few, very few.
5412140	5413260	This one won't.
5413260	5417820	So, uh, anyway, for you horse racing fans, and I know you're out there winning posts,
5417820	5422300	nine, the official from Koei Tecmo is out this week on the switch now quickly.
5422300	5423660	Let's look at the PlayStation five.
5424780	5429980	I can't believe it, but, uh, winning post is not a PlayStation five game.
5429980	5433980	It's not pushing the graphical, uh, what can be done.
5433980	5440300	So, uh, but we do have grand theft auto five gets a Japanese release this week on the PlayStation
5440300	5441180	five in Japan.
5441180	5442380	So that's neat.
5442940	5446780	Um, and that's it for the record.
5447740	5451180	I did look it up and there was a game called chrono break.
5451180	5452060	That was trademark.
5452060	5452860	That was it.
5452860	5453900	That was a chrono break.
5455020	5457020	And it never got green lit.
5457020	5462780	Um, and it's still sort of floating around there as a maybe, but the quote was that there
5462780	5465420	were a lot of politics involved in creating a new game.
5465420	5466460	That's where you're wrong.
5466460	5468060	They are on a chrono break.
5468060	5469340	So trademark.
5469340	5469840	Shut up.
5471900	5475740	And with my, with my luck, it'll be a mobile phone game at this point.
5475740	5477260	And I just, I get it.
5477260	5481180	Did you know that there, there was kingdom heart games announced for mobile phone and
5481180	5483100	you'll notice we didn't talk about them.
5483100	5485740	You know why we're not going to play them moving on.
5487740	5488300	Anyway.
5488300	5489020	Anyway.
5489500	5490540	Oh, I just, I'm sorry.
5490540	5491820	It's quickly, quickly in Japan.
5491820	5492620	I did need to say.
5493500	5497020	Winning post nine is out on the PlayStation four.
5497020	5498140	Just not the PlayStation five.
5498700	5500300	Very important footnote.
5500940	5502220	You may proceed with the UK.
5503580	5504060	All right.
5504060	5508300	So on the 12th, we have grand theft auto five for PlayStation and Xbox.
5508300	5512380	Epic chef for those and the switch on the 12th.
5512380	5518620	Also 13 sentinels Aegis rim on the switch for the 14th tormented souls for switch.
5519180	5519900	And that's it.
5521340	5524380	If Epic chef, isn't Gordon Ramsey, cussing me out.
5524940	5527180	Then it's not, it's not an Epic chef.
5527180	5528380	That's an angry chef.
5530380	5531500	He's just passionate.
5533260	5534460	But they only nice to the kids.
5534460	5538860	Yeah, I was going to say, but then when you watch the master chef kids, he's like the
5538860	5541900	nicest fucking person, which you, you know, it's all an act.
5541900	5543660	All that stuff on hell's kitchen is an act.
5543660	5545100	I'm sure he's a nice guy.
5545100	5550300	My, my favorite scene though, is with the lady that won the, the blind lady that won
5551660	5558940	and him demonstrating how good her pie turned out and using the sound of it and the texture.
5560940	5563020	Can you hear that your pie is done?
5563020	5567980	It's in, and she was all crying and happy, but that's like, still like my favorite moment
5567980	5572860	of how he is as a passionate cook and encouraging people to be their best.
5572860	5575980	Yeah, I think he, I think he's a nice guy deep down, but let's be real.
5576620	5581900	A lot of us watch for his persona on kitchen nightmares, which is very different.
5581900	5582620	He just doesn't take shit.
5584220	5584940	Exactly.
5584940	5585900	I like Gordon Ramsey.
5585900	5589900	I think he's a, he's a little saturated at this point.
5589900	5592220	Like how many shows is that man on seriously?
5593420	5597500	But then honestly, again, I went to the hell's kitchen restaurant in Vegas, not this recent
5597500	5602380	time, but when I was there a few years ago, pre pandemic, and I will say that was one
5602380	5603820	of the fucking best meals I've ever had.
5603820	5605020	So, you know what?
5605020	5608380	He fucking walks the walk as far as I'm concerned.
5608380	5609820	So have at it.
5610380	5613180	I still would rather go to a Morimoto restaurant first.
5613900	5614140	Yeah.
5614140	5615500	DJ Rama S points this out.
5616380	5621900	Rob, there was an episode where chef Ramsey yelled at someone, that person had an anxiety
5621900	5622540	attack.
5622540	5626060	He took the person aside and spoke to him and calmed him down.
5626060	5628940	Like that's like, yeah, that sounds very Gordon Ramsey.
5628940	5630620	Again, that's how you know it's an act.
5630620	5633580	Like Gordon Ramsey should probably win an Oscar.
5633580	5638700	I mean, I know Oscars aren't for TV shows, especially reality shows, but daytime, the
5638700	5639420	daytime is yes.
5639420	5642940	Gordon Ramsey should probably win a daytime Emmy for a lot of his performance.
5642940	5643740	Let's be real.
5643740	5644860	He should win an Emmy.
5644860	5651820	I know, um, the Emmy cannot get the amazing race and survivor or no it's drag race.
5651820	5657900	Now like Ru Paul has won that Emmy for like seven years and this may shock you.
5658140	5661420	I think it's time to stop giving Ru Paul the Emmy for that show.
5661420	5663180	Like it's, it's time.
5663180	5665180	It's time for Ru Paul to stop.
5665180	5669340	It's, it's time for that show to, to, you know, I, I like the talent.
5669340	5671180	If you're going to do anything, bring back Drag U.
5671180	5671580	Yeah.
5671580	5674380	But anyway, it's time to give the Emmy to Gordon Ramsey.
5674380	5677180	Lady Bunny has a wig to support.
5677180	5677680	Okay.
5679340	5679840	All right.
5680460	5681100	Moving on.
5681100	5682940	Um, let's see.
5682940	5683980	Oh, more now.
5683980	5684780	Here's the thing.
5685340	5686860	Well, we, here's the thing.
5686860	5688620	It's the show about video games.
5688620	5692380	But when I talk about video games, when Loki talks about Dark Star talks about videos,
5692380	5695740	we don't, we don't have nearly the chat lighting up this much.
5695740	5698940	We talk about Gordon Ramsey and now y'all got something to say.
5700700	5701900	It's just interesting.
5701900	5703020	I guess we just have to do that.
5703020	5704300	I guess so.
5704300	5704780	I know.
5704780	5706700	Yeah, we've, we've way overdue on that.
5706700	5707200	Sorry guys.
5707740	5713340	Jason says there was a shot of Ramsey and someone else at a Vegas Golden Knights, the hockey team.
5713340	5716780	See, if you're in, if you're anywhere near San Jose, you don't acknowledge the Golden
5716780	5717100	Knights.
5717100	5717500	That's the thing.
5717500	5718140	All right.
5718140	5722540	His smile was unlike any I've ever seen on him, on his shows.
5722540	5725260	Each Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, UK and US.
5725260	5728780	He's, he's because he's playing that guy on TV.
5731100	5735420	Phoenix 7726 says it's time for that show to sashay away.
5735420	5736140	Absolutely.
5737180	5740700	Phoenix says Gordon is huge on Twitch for some reason.
5740700	5745260	I, I have seen, I don't know how many Dead by Daylight streamers who will watch clips
5745260	5748220	of Kitchen Nightmares while they're waiting 30 minutes for their match.
5748940	5751100	So it's just a weird thing.
5751100	5751900	All right.
5751900	5754060	Anyway, moving on.
5754060	5754300	Yes.
5754300	5756140	And regarding OLR foodie.
5756140	5757580	We all know why it was delayed.
5758140	5760140	I'm ready to do the show again.
5760140	5762300	Like a lot has changed since October.
5762300	5762800	Okay.
5763180	5764460	But now the problem.
5767020	5768300	There's been lots of stuff going on.
5768300	5770220	Not with, with I think all of us, so.
5770300	5771260	Oh, for sure.
5771260	5776460	But, um, uh, I was going to say the only problem now is that we're not going to have dark soccer
5776460	5778700	next week and we're not going to have Loki in two weeks.
5778700	5781660	So at this point, I can't promise foodie Oh, until may.
5781660	5783020	And that's just a scheduling thing.
5783020	5785580	Cause everybody's got other stuff going on, which is legit.
5785580	5789340	Everybody's allowed to have a vacay every now and then I just went to Las Vegas.
5789340	5791420	I just happened to not be there on an OLR night.
5791420	5793020	I wish mine were big.
5793020	5797820	Well, if you want to tell them, tell them, but otherwise we're just going to gloss over
5797820	5798780	it like I've been doing.
5799340	5799660	All right.
5800140	5801260	Remember that stone?
5801900	5803420	It didn't go anywhere.
5803420	5803820	All right.
5803820	5809660	I, I, I got to, I got to send them the troops, you know, physically remove it.
5809660	5810780	You said it, not me.
5810780	5812220	So, um, there you go.
5812220	5815900	That's the mystery, mystery, mystery solved.
5815900	5819820	Your yours wasn't as little and cute invasive as that though.
5820860	5821820	No, I was awake.
5822780	5823900	So, all right.
5823900	5828620	Well, obviously Loki, we're all thinking of you through that, um, crappy scenario there.
5829020	5829820	Wishing you the best.
5829820	5835420	I mean, you seem in good spirits, all things, you will be fine, but it's, it's, it's, it's
5835420	5838220	like when my gallbladder came out, I knew I was going to be fine.
5838220	5840060	It's just fucking annoying.
5840060	5841900	The whole process is annoying.
5841900	5844540	Being out of commission for two weeks is annoying.
5844540	5845500	All of it is annoying.
5847260	5851980	All of my, all of my laparoscopies, like my last two surgeries that I had other than my
5851980	5853820	knee, I was happy.
5855100	5856540	I was happy to be out of commission.
5856540	5858220	I'm like, I'm on my couch.
5858700	5859900	No one's bothering me.
5860460	5861420	This is great.
5863420	5864060	All right.
5864060	5865020	Uh, let's move on.
5865020	5868060	We still have some shifts, some non Gordon Ramsey topics to get to.
5868060	5869180	Let's get to that.
5869180	5871020	Well, maybe Gordon Ramsey could show up in this.
5871020	5871500	I don't know.
5871500	5873660	Loki, uh, what do you think about this next story?
5874460	5876940	I mean, they have everything, so why not?
5876940	5884700	Um, so Epic games has, uh, partnered with, uh, Lego on a new project that they say, well,
5884700	5889660	and they drop metaverse into their pitch or whatever.
5889660	5896940	Um, so to me, it sounds like, you know, Roblox, but just licensable.
5896940	5902380	So, you know, whereas Roblox made something that looked very similar to Lego, but not
5902380	5911100	quite what this is basically Lego, but you know, Lego, um, neat be cool to see what they
5911100	5911660	come up with.
5911660	5912460	I love Lego.
5913260	5919820	So, you know, and after all, as I pointed out to Rob on Twitter, they have, uh, the
5919820	5921580	little, what do they call those?
5921580	5929820	Um, uh, gosh, um, the minifigures, it's not minifigs, but they're like the, uh, the brick
5929820	5930300	heads.
5930300	5932060	So they have the brick heads for the spice girls.
5932060	5935660	Now I saw that because they had the Muppets too is a thing.
5935660	5936220	Oh, they do.
5936220	5939340	Yeah, at least I'm pretty sure I saw that on like Twitter or something.
5940140	5945340	So yeah, I definitely want those spice girls went, but I'm like, Lego is that addiction.
5945340	5950300	I've been somehow able to stave off this whole time, even through the Mario's and all that.
5951180	5956380	It's, and it's one of those things I'm like, they have that, the Nintendo 64, uh, was it
5956380	5960700	Mario 64, uh, the question block base.
5960700	5964540	They have that a target and I keep, I keep passing by it every time because it's like
5964540	5965660	$170.
5965660	5967660	I'm like, yeah, block really.
5968620	5970460	Some somebody question block.
5970460	5972460	It's like, you know, that, that big or whatever.
5972460	5977180	And then it folds out into a bunch of the different, like it's a micro scale world of
5977180	5979100	like the different levels and stuff.
5980140	5984220	Well, somebody actually have a Lego Fiat kit that I haven't put together yet.
5985420	5990940	Somebody just brought into this house, um, some shelves, which was very kind and nice.
5990940	5994380	And it's perfect for showing off Legos to be quite honest.
5994380	5996780	If no, it's, it's made for cats.
5996860	5997180	Yeah.
5997180	6000700	If I wasn't worried about the cats, I'm not worried about smoosh as much.
6000700	6003740	Cause he's kind of too stupid to get past the first level.
6004540	6008700	But cheddar, I'm noticing like just in the short time we've had cheddar, I'm absolutely
6008700	6014060	noticing he will find the highest point in the room to climb up to and look down upon
6014060	6014940	the rest of you.
6014940	6016460	That is absolutely cheddars mo.
6016460	6017500	He's that kind of cat.
6017500	6020780	So the minute that shelving came in, I was like, Oh God cheddar.
6020780	6022540	I'm not going to be able to put anything on these shelves.
6022540	6025660	Cause cheddar is going to run up to the top immediately.
6025660	6029660	I will be able to put things on the shelves when I met him on the top of your closet.
6030780	6033020	I'll just have to get little, um, like cover.
6033020	6037740	I know Ikea has like coverings that can go over them so that he can't like actually knock
6037740	6038620	things over in them.
6038620	6040220	So like clear doors, basically.
6041020	6047100	You can also like, if you were going to put like things on display, like, I don't know
6047100	6051100	why trophies are coming to my mind, but just, you know, using that as an example or like
6051100	6056220	figures or things you can, um, get Velcro for the bottom of them.
6056220	6056780	Hmm.
6056780	6057500	That's a good idea.
6058140	6059100	I want a trophy.
6059980	6061340	I haven't had a trophy in a long time.
6063020	6067180	For all the podcasts award right in front of me, but the Midna doesn't get up there
6067180	6070620	for all the, she doesn't get anywhere that there's not food for all the jokes people
6070620	6073180	make about participation trophies and then to stay in age.
6073180	6073980	Where's my trophy?
6073980	6074940	I don't have a trophy.
6074940	6075100	Yeah.
6075100	6079180	We have a podcast award, but dark soccer, you've, you've, you've taken custody of that
6079180	6080060	and that's fine.
6080300	6081580	You were the one that went down.
6081580	6083100	I was like, you went down and got in person.
6083100	6083740	It's only fair.
6083740	6084620	I get it.
6084620	6087020	Um, but do they still do those?
6087740	6090220	Uh, they do, but it's changed a lot over the years.
6090220	6094540	We kind of corporate, no, it's just at some point you had to pay to be in them and I'm
6094540	6095900	just not interested in that.
6095900	6096540	Yeah.
6096540	6101900	So, um, most award shows are like these days anyways that you have to like pay for the
6101900	6102940	privilege or whatever.
6103580	6103900	Yeah.
6103900	6106540	I'm just, it's, that's not the kind of thing that interests me.
6106540	6109900	I just, I would, I love people being here live on Sunday.
6110540	6112700	And listening to the podcast throughout the week.
6112700	6114540	I don't, I don't need no word for that.
6114540	6115900	It was nice to win that award.
6115900	6116540	It was more than nice.
6116540	6117500	It was lovely.
6117500	6119660	Um, especially because it was the first year.
6119660	6120300	It was nice.
6120300	6120940	It was a surprise.
6120940	6121180	Yeah.
6121180	6121820	It kind of was.
6122380	6124620	Um, and uh, yeah, yeah.
6124620	6125980	Bonsovo six is wait, we got a trophy.
6125980	6126060	Yeah.
6126060	6126780	We won the pot.
6126780	6132300	We won the very first podcast award in 2005 for best gaming podcast.
6133180	6139180	So believe, believe it or not, uh, this, this, this was the best one.
6140140	6140780	At that time.
6143500	6146940	So anyway, uh, let's move on.
6146940	6149580	Uh, let's talk about this story, dark soccer.
6151340	6154300	So, um, y'all remember missed, right?
6154300	6158140	You know, pointy, clicky adventure, pretty place.
6158140	6160620	Um, yeah, now it's a mini golf game.
6161660	6169100	So there, uh, so it's going to be a DLC pack for a VR.
6169580	6171420	Golf game called walkabout mini golf.
6172140	6178700	Um, and it will be available on meta quest and steam VR developed by, uh, mighty coconut.
6179740	6184860	So you too can shoot balls around in the world of mist.
6186300	6188300	They also have a course based on labyrinth,
6189420	6193100	which would give me some minor incentive to actually play that except VR.
6195660	6197660	Yeah, I check out the golf thing for sure.
6197660	6198460	That sounds fun.
6199740	6199980	All right.
6200460	6203820	Uh, well, whereas I would be interested in playing that, let's be real.
6203820	6206220	I'm never going to be interested in playing this next game, but we're gonna talk about
6206220	6206700	it anyway.
6206700	6209900	Cause it's fun to dunk on this company.
6209900	6210380	Loki.
6212860	6213740	Yes.
6213740	6214620	Yes.
6214620	6216300	So we've gotten to that point.
6216300	6219020	I guess it's, it's, you know, in the stage of stages.
6219020	6221180	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6221180	6222300	We've been in that point.
6222300	6226380	We've bought a house in that point where we're sending our mail from that point.
6226380	6231260	And it's being, uh, uh, self-addressed stamped with you are here at the point.
6233340	6233740	Yeah.
6233740	6240940	So, uh, Konami, uh, recently made a comment, uh, regarding their updates to E football.
6240940	6241180	Yes.
6241180	6243420	Remember that's still a game barely.
6243420	6249660	Um, basically saying that we've entered what would be eventually a two year period of developing
6249660	6251740	for E football 2022.
6251740	6256460	However, we were too focused on getting the game out on time that we lost sight of the
6256460	6259340	most important thing quality.
6262300	6266460	Naturally, we were met with critical reviews from rightfully disappointing fans.
6268700	6272780	And there's no, like, I don't see any assertion that we won't do this again.
6275100	6279340	No, you know, since we're talking about searching that they won't do that.
6279340	6280780	Since we're talking about trophies.
6282060	6284460	Why don't we get a, you try.
6284460	6285100	Why no, no.
6285100	6289500	Why don't we make Konami a trophy that says literally the dumbest thing that's ever happened
6289500	6293660	in gaming and send it to their office and see what happens.
6296620	6300460	Like, is it to have like worst decision making ever?
6300460	6301660	Is it, is it petty?
6302220	6302940	Yes.
6302940	6304300	Am I above that?
6304300	6305180	No, no.
6305980	6309820	When it comes to Konami, are we, are we at that point?
6309820	6310220	Yes.
6310220	6312540	I've already, I've already explained this to everybody.
6312540	6318220	We're at that point where Konami is that just the, the board that is running Konami.
6318940	6321500	It could, it could not be run by worse people.
6321500	6326380	Like if Elon Musk bought Konami, I'd actually be like, you know what?
6326380	6327420	Maybe they'll be okay.
6329020	6331420	Like, I, I don't see.
6331420	6335020	Well, maybe the other guy that Loki talked about would actually somehow be worse for
6335020	6335420	Konami.
6335420	6338940	So I'm not going to joke about that, but Elon Musk, I will joke about.
6338940	6342620	And most people getting in and stepping about Konami, I will joke about.
6342620	6345420	And that would probably be better for that company at the end of the day.
6348540	6353020	S2100 Matt says there should be a segment called this week and Konami dunking on itself.
6353020	6353740	Yeah, pretty much.
6354620	6360540	Questbuster says, if anyone had doubts, whether Konami was past caring, eFootball is there
6360540	6364060	to remind them that yes, we are not the company you remember in your childhood.
6364060	6365260	That is correct.
6365260	6366300	That is correct.
6366300	6372540	At this point, the best we can hope for is that when Sony said, hi, we're going to give
6372540	6377340	you money for nothing to put games on service, Konami signed off on that.
6377340	6383260	And we will have sweet code and one, two, three, four, and five all on this PlayStation
6384540	6385500	plus thing.
6385500	6391740	Cause I'm telling you right now, if one of those games is missing, that is exactly where
6392380	6397260	the Kotaku Ardo will be out in five minutes about how that game is missing from PlayStation
6397260	6403340	plus, sweet code and four, not on PlayStation plus PlayStation plus major oversights does
6403340	6404540	not have sweet code and five.
6408220	6414380	I'm telling you right now, if Sony does not have those games on the service, don't bother.
6415980	6416780	Don't bother.
6418540	6421500	Anyway, let's see.
6421500	6422300	What else do we have?
6422300	6427020	Oh yes, actually this is, this is somewhat big news for the last story, but I think it's
6427020	6431900	one of those things where we, we as gaming consumers don't really see the result of this
6431900	6439180	for some time, but the unreal five engine has been officially released.
6439180	6444780	It has been an early access for a year, but this last week, Epic games officially released
6444780	6446540	UE5 to developers.
6447260	6452940	Of course, some may remember the matrix awakens tech demo to show a little bit of what UE5
6452940	6453900	can actually do.
6455900	6459980	Which, you know, it looked really good and I think we're kind of excited to see what
6459980	6460540	it can produce.
6462540	6468060	But you know, the actual games that come from this probably won't be out for a little while
6468700	6471020	because studios have only really had a year to play with it.
6471580	6476300	For instance, black myth, wukong, which was one of the first announced unreal engine five
6476300	6476860	games.
6476860	6478620	That's not out until 2023.
6479340	6483260	The next Witcher game, ha keep on waiting.
6484220	6486780	We do know though, a new Tomb Raider game.
6486780	6488940	I mean, of course they're going to make a new Tomb Raider game.
6488940	6490140	Why wouldn't they make a new Tomb Raider game?
6490140	6493740	It'd be ridiculous if they didn't make a new Tomb Raider game, but we know that the next
6493740	6497420	Tomb Raider game is going to be on unreal engine five because it was actually announced
6497420	6503660	on the official Tomb Raider account in a tweet that said crystal dynamics is incredibly excited
6503660	6507500	about the future of unreal and how it will help us take our storytelling to the next
6507500	6508060	level.
6508060	6512220	That's why we're proud to announce that our next Tomb Raider game is being built on unreal
6512220	6512860	engine five.
6513820	6514780	Hey, you know what?
6515420	6520460	I'm ready to see it because the Tomb Raider reboots from God, that series probably started
6520460	6521740	almost 10 years ago at this point.
6521740	6522860	What was the Tomb Raider reboot?
6522860	6524220	That was like 2013, wasn't it?
6524860	6529900	So the Lara Croft and the no good, terrible, terrible, very bad day.
6529900	6531340	Yeah, that whole trilogy.
6532140	6536380	You know, I mean, those already looked really good for its time.
6536380	6540540	Imagining that in unreal engine five, I think those games are going to be fire.
6540540	6547500	Now, I know the Avengers, a lot of people believe was a misstep for crystal dynamics.
6548060	6553420	I have a feeling there's a little bit of too many cooks in the kitchen going on with that.
6553420	6559020	And, you know, hopefully with the next Tomb Raider, people kind of back off and let crystal
6559020	6560460	dynamics do the game they want to do.
6561180	6563020	And hopefully that'll be nice.
6563020	6571260	So rep cycled is in our chat over twitch.tv slash fog network saying UE five engine looking
6571260	6572220	shiny so far.
6572860	6573740	Height.
6573740	6575740	Yeah, I'm excited to see what comes out of this.
6576620	6581820	Loki, you didn't make a game in unreal engine, though, but you've messed around with it,
6581820	6582380	right?
6582380	6583260	I have.
6583260	6586540	Yeah, I have time to car with before you canceled.
6586540	6588460	It was in that was unity.
6588460	6589660	No, that was unity.
6589660	6597020	I did I did a mop type game in unreal to try to learn it.
6597820	6605740	And I for me, it was that because I don't really know C++ or I haven't worked in C++
6605740	6605980	too much.
6605980	6610940	So I tried using their blueprints and blueprints are all right, but it's very cumbersome to
6610940	6614460	do things, but I got it to work and it was all right.
6614460	6615980	It was just kind of learning it.
6616700	6618620	Yeah, so yeah.
6618620	6619120	All right.
6620220	6622940	Well, that's all the slated stories we have for tonight.
6622940	6626140	We'll check in in a year and see what games come out for unreal.
6626140	6626380	Yeah.
6627660	6629660	Well, I actually wanted to bring it.
6629660	6633020	It's not really an unreal five, but it is unreal.
6633020	6634300	You know, four point two five.
6634300	6634540	Sure.
6635100	6640620	Did you see the PTB with the Haddonfield rework for Dead by Daylight?
6641980	6643340	No, I've seen the screen.
6643340	6646300	The still screenshots, but I haven't seen people playing on the map.
6646940	6651100	I saw I was watching LC play it the other day.
6652140	6653260	It's really good.
6653260	6653980	It looks nice.
6653980	6657580	And the Legion music is really good.
6658780	6663180	Like to explain to people who don't play, all of the killers have like their own chase
6663180	6665260	music, but Legion is actually four people.
6666380	6668780	And so each of them have their own chase music.
6670060	6674300	If you play, they have like a standard chase music, but each of them has an add on that's
6674300	6675420	like their own mix tape.
6675420	6677900	And when you do that, it changes up the music.
6677900	6682780	And then if you do two of their mix tapes as your add ons, then it really changes the
6682780	6683100	music.
6683100	6684940	It's called like the frantic mix tape.
6685740	6687900	And it's pretty darn good.
6687900	6691740	I have to say it was a very clever idea and something worth noting.
6691740	6695260	Yeah, I know they're reworking that killer and they're reworking Ghostface.
6696380	6699020	Not from the screen movies seemed really cool.
6699020	6702140	A lot of people who weren't Legion fans said that they were suddenly really fun.
6702140	6702380	Yeah.
6703020	6707660	And then the Haddonfield map, because the very first, you know, Dead by Daylight is
6707660	6710060	kind of known at this point as like the multiverse of horror.
6710060	6710780	Right.
6710780	6718060	But the very first license that game got that started the dam break was Halloween, Michael
6718060	6719740	Myers and Laurie Strode.
6719740	6723260	So that Haddonfield map is as old as the game, pretty much.
6723260	6725740	Yeah, that was the first licensed level.
6725740	6726220	Yeah.
6726220	6726700	Yeah.
6726700	6727100	Yeah.
6727100	6731420	So they're totally redoing it now because that, you know, over the years, it just with
6731420	6734860	all the new perks, the new talents, the new things that new characters get, that map
6734860	6737180	starts to show its problems on how the new talent.
6737180	6739260	So they're completely redo because they got rid of the basement.
6739260	6740540	Didn't they in that map?
6740540	6742940	Not not the basement basement, but like the fake basement.
6744220	6744700	No.
6744700	6745740	Oh, I heard they got rid of it.
6745740	6746780	The basement still there.
6746780	6747340	Oh, okay.
6747340	6747740	Interesting.
6747740	6748700	Oh, I'm curious.
6748700	6749580	From what I remember.
6750460	6753340	But also, the houses have furniture.
6753980	6755020	Yeah, it looks nice.
6755020	6755740	It was really nice.
6756940	6761180	Before though, the thing that made that map kind of cool is that all of the like
6761180	6764060	artwork on the walls were actually concept drawings.
6765660	6766160	So.
6768220	6773580	I found out another thing that the entirety of the Hawkins Laboratory is still in the game files.
6774700	6777580	I still think they should try to repurpose it somehow,
6777580	6781020	but maybe just legally, it's probably impossible at this point.
6781820	6785820	I think they should make it the recording studio for the all kill chapter, but.
6785820	6786320	Yeah.
6787500	6789660	Didn't mean to derail, but I thought it was worth mentioning.
6789660	6790300	No, it's fine.
6791020	6795420	Well, usually we get to derail because when I go to the mailbag and it's empty, we derail,
6795420	6798460	which I believe our mailbag is empty this week, but I could be wrong.
6798460	6798780	It is.
6798780	6800300	So I was proactively derailing.
6800300	6801500	All right, that's fine.
6802140	6805340	Participate at orangeslaundry.com if you want to send us an email
6805980	6808540	on any topic, whether we did or we didn't talk about it.
6808540	6810460	I would also usually talk about Drag Race here.
6810460	6816860	I don't think Dark Soccer is watching, but there's spoiler alert for this week's Drag Race.
6816860	6823100	Sorry, there's a top five this year because in this season we don't eliminate people.
6823100	6825260	So five girls got to the end.
6825260	6827580	So I was going to ask if you have a fave.
6827580	6829020	How do they get rid of people?
6829660	6834540	No, they have been getting rid of people, but it's so like there was a double save this week.
6834540	6836860	A chocolate bar saved somebody this week.
6836860	6839820	There was a, um, they didn't get rid of somebody.
6839820	6841580	Twist every round, right?
6841580	6845740	They're stretching it out as long as possible to get more episodes out of it so they can
6845740	6847980	charge more when the show is inevitably syndicated.
6849180	6850460	That's what they're doing.
6850460	6853740	But anyway, um, so, so there's a top five.
6853740	6856060	They didn't want to eliminate any of the bottom two this last week.
6856060	6858700	So Willow Pill and, uh, Angeria were in the bottom two.
6859420	6863900	Of course they were because they're friends and, uh, both made it through to the finale.
6863900	6866700	So I'm, I'm curious if Dark Soccer has a fave.
6866700	6868220	Our local girl is still in it.
6868780	6870460	Lady Camden is in the finals.
6870460	6871580	I haven't watched any of it.
6871580	6872140	Oh, okay.
6873020	6877900	I like Willow Pill, but I kind of have to root for the local one, even if, um, she's local.
6878460	6881900	Well, she lives in SAC, but she performs in San Francisco.
6881900	6884780	So I, I, she, she really, Oh, Lady Camden.
6885580	6885980	Okay.
6885980	6886220	Yeah.
6886220	6891100	So, which I, I did not know that name before Drag Race because I think she performs in
6891100	6892380	the Bay Area that much.
6892380	6894460	Um, but she's, I think I might've seen her at Hamburger Mary's.
6895260	6896940	Oh, fuck.
6896940	6898300	Maybe I did too, actually.
6899740	6900620	Now that you say that.
6900700	6902700	Now that you say that vaguely familiar.
6902700	6904060	Yeah, maybe, maybe.
6904060	6904620	All right.
6904620	6910540	Anyway, so, um, she, she's, I would, she's kind of the front runner.
6910540	6915980	I think a lot of the fans kind of want Willow Pill, but I, she's, she's won like three challenges.
6916540	6922140	So we, we may have a Sacramento girl actually win fucking Drag Race this year, which is wild to me.
6922780	6923580	So I know.
6923580	6923980	Right.
6923980	6924620	Yeah.
6924620	6925020	All right.
6925020	6926620	Anyway, um, let's move on.
6926620	6930300	Maybe we can actually see some of our friends who perform in Sacramento up.
6930620	6931500	That would be nice.
6931500	6931980	That'd be nice.
6931980	6932700	There's some girls here.
6932700	6933660	I'd love to see on the show.
6934220	6938460	Um, uh, moving on, let's actually, Dragula is the one I want to see.
6939580	6945580	I yeah, there's like, I can't say I have seen land insider perform and it was amazing.
6946620	6952620	There's, I'm, I'm, I am completely biased because I've hosted these people numerous times,
6952620	6955500	but I would love to see like Chris front is here locally.
6955500	6960220	I would love to see them on the, on, and red fulfill, I think would be incredible and regular.
6960220	6961820	So shout out to my locals.
6961820	6968220	So anyway, um, moving on, let's, uh, let's get into other stuff.
6968220	6969340	Last minute stories.
6969340	6970220	Loki, you have anything?
6971820	6974140	No, it's that kind of week, huh?
6974140	6977020	I'm just reading up on the, the more in television.
6977820	6978860	More drama.
6978860	6979420	Great.
6979420	6980540	Well, just the same.
6980540	6988300	It's so I think there's still, they have, uh, uh, I don't know where I think it's from
6988300	6992620	Twitter or something, or maybe even one of like a feedback in one of their fundings that
6992620	6998060	they were doing, but basically saying that, Hey, you know, that, that, um, galaxy purple
6998060	7003420	that was exclusive, the GameStop, well, now you can pre-order that, uh, through the television
7003420	7008300	Mico site, because it's no longer going to be getting some exclusive because they may
7008300	7009660	not even be carrying it.
7011100	7011420	What?
7011420	7014540	Cause, cause that's why they canceled the orders.
7014540	7017820	So, uh, I just think that it's absolutely silly.
7018300	7021820	That they're still taking pre-orders on it, even though they know that it's not coming.
7021820	7022060	Yeah.
7023740	7027900	Well, I'm still holding out hope that I get one because at this point it's a collector's
7027900	7028540	item.
7028540	7032300	I don't, even if it's the showgirls of gaming consoles, I don't care.
7032300	7034700	Like I it's, it's a collector's item.
7034700	7036060	You you'll laugh at me now.
7036060	7040220	And then in 10 years you'll want to play it like, so laugh away.
7040220	7040860	Ha ha ha.
7041660	7041980	All right.
7042620	7047660	Anyway, uh, let's see, go into some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash a Vogue
7047660	7051660	and network, uh, bonds, double a six saying a dead by daylight on the unreal five engine
7051660	7055660	for couch, local co-op, you know, there's going to come a point where that they're going
7055660	7056940	to have to remake that game.
7056940	7060620	Basically, they're going to have to, cause we all, the, the longest running joke in the
7061660	7064460	community is that it's spaghetti coated to hell.
7064460	7067740	That like it's, it's being held together with duct tape at this point.
7067740	7072220	Um, they changed, they change a graphic somewhere over here and a killer ability breaks.
7072220	7073500	It's it's wild.
7073500	7076860	So, um, they're going to need to redo that game from scratch at some point.
7076860	7082300	I don't know if that means dead by daylight too, or what that is, but, um, yeah, uh, bonds
7082300	7086780	double six is also saying 2024 is too soon for an unreal game.
7086780	7089100	Somebody had brought up a like unreal tournament.
7089100	7091660	Uh, give me unreal tournament 2025.
7091660	7093820	Now they have three years, even a damn demo.
7094700	7097260	Well, I will probably start seeing the UE five stuff.
7097260	7100860	You know, you'll see indie stuff probably sooner rather than later, but I think you'll
7100860	7103420	see the real oomph from that engine.
7103420	7105820	Uh, probably, you know, start to see it next year.
7105820	7110380	You know, um, rumor is that kingdom hearts four is going to be in UE five.
7110380	7114700	So, you know, you'll see that hypothetically someday.
7117900	7121020	Your grandkids might the next generation.
7121820	7122220	All right.
7122220	7122720	Anyway.
7123420	7123920	All right.
7124700	7127260	Well, with that, we're out of material.
7127980	7128860	We're at the end.
7128860	7129420	C'est la fin.
7130060	7131100	Anybody else have anything?
7131260	7136860	Um, um, marathon Thursday.
7136860	7137360	Yes.
7137360	7138140	Hang out with me.
7138140	7140940	And you're not going to be here for the next OLR because you're out of town.
7140940	7141980	I'll eat a whole cake.
7144940	7145500	I'll be fine.
7145500	7145980	I'll come say hi.
7145980	7153980	Yeah, I'm not going to be here, uh, cause that is the day that I am, uh, driving to,
7153980	7156140	uh, stay with Marissa.
7157180	7158540	Tell her I said hi.
7158540	7159180	I miss her.
7159420	7159980	I miss her.
7160780	7161500	I will.
7161500	7163260	I miss Marissa too.
7163260	7164380	That'd be great.
7164380	7164860	Have fun.
7165740	7167660	You're going to Disney, right?
7167660	7168780	Or did that change?
7168780	7170540	Yeah, I'm going to Disneyland.
7170540	7177660	I'm also meeting up with, uh, with, uh, our streamer friends, uh, Nick and Prince and
7177660	7179820	hopefully Nathan and hopefully Isaaco.
7179820	7180380	That's great.
7180380	7181260	Tell them all I said hi.
7182460	7183180	I sure will.
7184220	7184620	Awesome.
7184620	7185100	Awesome.
7185100	7186220	You get some comments from chat.
7186780	7189180	Bonds double six is tell Marissa I said hello as well.
7189180	7192540	So let Marissa know the chatters are thinking of her.
7192540	7194700	Marissa, our chat says hi and they miss you.
7197100	7197900	All right.
7197900	7200460	Um, that is, that is it.
7200460	7201260	That's going to do it.
7201260	7204140	So, uh, let's wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts.
7204140	7207100	Oh, before I do that, of course, I want to thank you guys as always for listening to
7207100	7207820	orange launch radio.
7207820	7211340	Thank you for being here, participating with our show, even on a short week that was a
7211340	7212300	little lighter on the news.
7212300	7212860	What can you do?
7212860	7213740	It's April.
7213740	7216700	Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show.
7216700	7219820	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if
7219820	7221420	the voices aren't here to put out on air.
7222540	7224460	So, uh, help us grow our community.
7224460	7227420	Uh, spread the word about vog network here on Twitch.
7227420	7231420	A follow goes an awful long way and we really appreciate those follows.
7231420	7232140	So what was that?
7233020	7236220	Make my monster grow, make my monster grow.
7236220	7237740	Uh, that's it.
7237740	7241020	Um, join our discord vog network.com slash discord.
7241580	7242940	Talk to us throughout the week.
7242940	7244540	Uh, submit story ideas.
7244540	7245580	That's fabulous as well.
7246220	7247820	Let's get everybody's final thoughts.
7247820	7249420	We will start, of course, with dark soccer.
7251660	7254940	Um, people are salty and MMR sucks.
7256780	7257660	Hopefully they fix it.
7257660	7258220	I'll see you on the flip side.
7258220	7258860	I've been trying.
7258860	7259580	All right.
7259580	7260380	We'll see you in a little bit.
7261500	7262940	Dark soccer, everybody.
7262940	7264620	Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?
7265340	7269260	My final thought is also, uh, part of, I guess, the last minute story.
7269260	7272860	So as I was talking about the amico stuff, um, so they did put out, I guess,
7272860	7278220	an email or something to, um, people that had stuff pre-ordered and they're trying to
7278220	7283820	get folks that had pre-orders at GameStop to now pre-order them directly through Intellivision.
7284620	7289980	And they listed new prices for the Galaxy purple and vintage wood grain.
7289980	7294620	They went three, three 39 99 for a console with two controllers,
7294620	7297660	two 89 99 for console with one controller.
7297660	7300940	And they're not taking any pre-orders right now on black or the white systems.
7303100	7306460	So it sounds like they're trying to end.
7306460	7311740	Apparently folks that have tried to request a refund on their, um, pre-orders have gotten
7311740	7312620	no money back.
7312620	7318860	They say right now, though, um, that they're not taking for all new orders going forward.
7318860	7323740	No deposit will be required until we finalize and announce a manufacturing date.
7324700	7330780	Um, but for all those who did already pre-order, you know, with a deposit, yeah, you can get
7330780	7331180	that back.
7333980	7334300	Great.
7335740	7339020	Again, when am I going to learn this Kickstarter lesson?
7339020	7339500	I don't know.
7340220	7340620	All right.
7341180	7348380	My final thought for tonight is what on earth am I going to do with 16 shiny mudkips?
7348380	7351820	What am I going to do with 16 shiny mudkips?
7352860	7354780	Now granted question for Shane.
7354780	7358940	Well, I caught like three of them the first time, but I caught like a loop.
7358940	7363340	I caught too many today and I only played for like an hour and a half.
7363340	7364700	I just walked around the Capitol.
7364700	7365340	That was it.
7366700	7367260	Gosh.
7367260	7367660	Wow.
7367660	7369420	And in chat, they're like, I only got five tail.
7369420	7370300	I only got four day.
7370300	7374060	Oh no, I could barely play the first mudkip day today.
7374060	7375980	I got 12.
7377740	7378620	I got 12 today.
7381340	7382380	All zero stars.
7382380	7386620	Oh, I only got, I had a three star from the first mudkip day somehow.
7386620	7390940	So that's the one I've kind of been investing all the candy in, but I don't have any stardust.
7390940	7392460	Keep burning it anyway.
7392460	7392780	Yay.
7392780	7393580	Pokemon go.
7394140	7395980	I'm level 53 in Pikmin though.
7395980	7397180	I'm kicking that game's ass.
7397740	7398060	All right.
7399020	7400300	That's it, everybody.
7400300	7401020	That's going to do it.
7401020	7402540	Thank you again for listening to our show.
7402540	7404300	We will see you again next week.
7404300	7405900	Have a wonderful week.
