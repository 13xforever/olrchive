1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,240
There's been a disturbing trend of businesses and official bodies using temporary statuses

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,800
to get around organizational measures despite the strife it causes everyone.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,240
Gig work was not the start of it, but today it is second only to retail as a significant

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
example.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,840
Who else but Activision Blizzard forced the hand of their workers to vote in favor of

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,240
their rights, bringing better pay, insurance, benefits to a dearly overworked and underappreciated

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
group.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,320
With a political wonk intro, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers,

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,880
and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,280
Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,660
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,680
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,360
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 909 of our

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,140
show for this April the 10th of 2022.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,020
My name is Rob Robertson.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,840
I am joined every week here via the magic of the internet and Discord and things like

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,640
that with my co-hosts.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,620
Say hello to Zoltar.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,620
No it starts.

20
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,620
I'm not Zoltar.

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,180
It's Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,220
Hold on, I forgot to turn on my lamps.

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,180
But you have that shirt that says Zoltar and it's just, sorry, I can't help it.

24
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,180
So I'm like, is this like the movie big?

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,400
Well the shirt actually, hold on.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I like the shirt.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
It's a little big.

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,080
Oh, it's coin up downtown.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
Oh, I see.

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
I see.

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
The other voice you hear.

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,280
And they got a cease and desist on it and I have one of the last ones you can get.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,960
Oh, that's fun to always get something that's been declared illegal.

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,440
The other voice you hear there, of course, Techmaster Loki joining us tonight.

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
Hi, Loki.

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
Hello.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,960
I had worms crawling on me, so that was not good.

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
What?

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Gross.

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,200
You know, it's the season where the oak worms or whatever those are, like fall from the

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
trees and stuff.

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Oh.

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,320
So there was like something earlier, like I felt crawling on me and I like threw it

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
off.

45
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
No thanks.

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
I didn't see where it went.

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,120
My new house does not have a front or a backyard and this is why.

48
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,140
This is exactly what those things are.

49
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,400
We have a giant tree.

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
I don't know what they are.

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
They're like, I thought they're called oak worms.

52
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
I've never had worms fall out of a tree.

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,160
Well, they're less worms and more like caterpillar looking things.

54
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,280
They're like tiny little like green.

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
They're not.

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
It's more of a caterpillar.

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Like a little grub?

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
I guess.

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Yes.

60
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Or it's got legs.

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,560
So, I mean, it's sort of, it's more caterpillar, but like, yeah, they hang from like a little

62
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,800
tiny, it looks like a, a spider web type thing.

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,680
They hang down a little string and they swing there in the tree and so they'll drop on you

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
sometimes.

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
All right.

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,360
Well, let me come back to you in a second, Loki, to talk about worms and not the, you

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,480
know, classic PC and PlayStation and a multi-platform game, but Dark Sakura, your shirt, Zoltar, it

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,440
makes me think there is actually, this is going to be very random, but I don't care.

69
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,500
There's actually a pokey stop portal, depending on what game you play, called Zoltar that

70
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
I saw in Vegas.

71
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,320
And so your shirt made me think of that because you know, those, those machines are kind of

72
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,680
everywhere in the big tourist trap areas.

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
So cool.

74
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,960
It's fun.

75
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Yeah.

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,040
Going back to Loki, I see the game playing behind you tonight because we do tape live

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,000
every Sunday night at 9 PM Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,160
slash a VOG network, VOG network, right after the Bobby black will show.

79
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,880
And you know, if you, if you watch our videos you can see us, you know, talking and doing

80
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,720
our show, but sometimes we have things going on behind us.

81
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,840
And so Loki has a Sonic the Hedgehog playing and I think hedgehog too.

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Okay.

83
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,160
So I'm thinking this must be to do with the movie and knowing that you are a big Jim Carrey

84
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,000
fan, knowing that you have kids that are right around the right age for this, I'm going to

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
guess you went and saw Sonic 2 this weekend.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And how was it?

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How was it?

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I mean, it's great.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I loved it.

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I love Jim Carrey.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Was that white parts in the mood?

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,480
There's parts of the movie that didn't need to be there.

94
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,160
They were, I don't know who they're supposed to be funny for, I guess adults, but it was

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,720
just like, kind of, it's fine, you know?

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,960
And funny, one of the characters in there is a character, it's an actor that was in

97
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:33,200
the show Criminal Minds that my wife has nicknamed Wigglebrows anyways, but it's funny to see

98
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,340
him play a special agent as well in this.

99
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,340
But yeah, it was great.

100
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,540
I think, you know, they really did a good job of capturing, you know, just all the characters

101
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,540
that are in it.

102
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,620
It's a little disappointing to hear that Jim Carrey might not be doing the next movie,

103
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,540
because he's retiring from acting, but we'll see.

104
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,620
If not, they can move with him.

105
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,740
Without getting spoilery, because I don't want to be mean.

106
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,420
There's some people that haven't seen it yet, but I understand there is a post credit sequence

107
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,700
that sets it up so that Jim Carrey doesn't have to be there.

108
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,700
Sort of.

109
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Yeah, yeah.

110
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Yeah.

111
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,020
But there is something that was revealed that is, you know, they could make a movie around

112
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
that.

113
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,660
But it's not going to be as exciting for you, because you're just, you're a Jim Carrey fan.

114
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,140
Anyway, it's like Jim Carrey, old video games.

115
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,140
It's a good mix.

116
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,140
Yeah, exactly.

117
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,820
Well, the movie's number one in the box office this weekend, and it did even better than

118
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,820
the first one.

119
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,740
And I have to admit, I'm kind of not surprised, like, I think we're in this era now.

120
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,060
And I think this is why now Nintendo is revisiting the Mario movie concept, right?

121
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,580
Because we all know about the Mario movie in the late 80s that was not good, the one

122
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,580
with Bob Hoskins.

123
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,460
Right, because now you have people that, like, have grown up with video games that are now

124
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,220
directors and producers and stuff.

125
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,220
That's it.

126
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,260
We have the technology for the CG.

127
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,660
And that too, but like, you have people that actually care about the, you know, they grew

128
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,660
up with this stuff.

129
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,580
And now they want to, like, pay tribute to it instead of just like, oh, I'm a director

130
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,500
and I'm going to make a movie because it'll make money because it's a property type of

131
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
thing.

132
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,940
I only, only, only ever can think of John Leguizamo in one role.

133
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,380
I that was a CG.

134
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,100
I was going to say in To Wong Foo, I mean, some people might say like spawn or something,

135
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
but no.

136
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,040
Little Latin boy, why are you crying?

137
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
There's also the very good in spawn.

138
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,400
The Romeo and Juliet movie, which I loved.

139
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,880
I know a lot of people didn't love that Baz Luhrmann Romeo and Juliet I think was an incredibly

140
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
underrated movie.

141
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,920
I think that movie is phenomenal.

142
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,800
I think you have to be, well, I think you have to be a certain age.

143
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,560
I think it's one of those, like, it's definitely a Gen X movie, not just Gen X, but like Gen

144
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,840
X, late Gen X, where we are the Oregon Trail, Zillennial, if you will, that whole thing.

145
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,680
I think you have to specifically be in that age range to appreciate that Romeo and Juliet

146
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
movie.

147
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
I don't know what it is.

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,640
I don't know if it's because of who's in it, but, or, or just what it was doing for movies.

149
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,120
Well, speaking of what things are doing for movies, I haven't heard a bad thing about

150
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
that.

151
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,880
Everything everywhere all at once that new Michelle Yeoh movie.

152
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,020
I love her.

153
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,760
I absolutely love her.

154
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,120
I think she's one of the best things to happen to Star Trek in however long.

155
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,000
I think she's incredible.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,920
And I'm, I'm happy she's getting to headline a movie and the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis

157
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,320
is in it and they got data to un-retire.

158
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,680
I think that, yeah, so that's the movie I wanted to go see this weekend, but we just

159
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
didn't get around to it.

160
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,960
We had some other stuff going, no, no, not, not that data.

161
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,400
I mean data, data from the Goonies, that data Star Trek.

162
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:50,520
And I was thinking, sorry, no, no, fair, fair, yeah, well, I'm sorry, short round round.

163
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,720
If you want to talk about Picard, let's talk about season three and un-retiring because

164
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,200
they just, they fucking got everybody, everybody, except for Wesley, but you know, but for all

165
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,120
we know, for all we know, he'll have a cameo, but you know, everybody's like, where's X,

166
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
where's Y, you know what?

167
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,000
They got the top lines there.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,440
So I mean, if Denise Crosby shows up, that's just a plus at that point in my opinion.

169
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,320
So that's that.

170
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,720
Let's see, SJ 100 Matt in chat talking about the Sonic movie says they released it at the

171
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,880
right time.

172
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,440
Not a lot of big movies come out during Oscar season because they're too busy promoting

173
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,100
previous year's movies.

174
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,760
They came in just after that and the summer blockbusters.

175
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,520
Yeah, I think, and this is similar with games.

176
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,900
I know it's a video game podcast, but I think, I think that concept of like the right time

177
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,780
to release something kind of went out the window.

178
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,360
Like I don't think movies have to come out in the summer or the winter anymore.

179
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,160
And I think like, they just put out a Batman movie a few weeks ago.

180
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,280
Like, you know, there there's movies that do very scream.

181
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,920
The reboot did better, almost better than there.

182
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,300
I don't know how well it did, but I know it did better than scream four.

183
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,320
And that was like, what a January February release, you know, so honestly enough parsing

184
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,560
them out like this, remove some of the competition for people who have to pick and choose what

185
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,800
movies they're going to go see at any given point in time who don't have the disposable

186
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,640
income to go see multiple movies, especially with how expensive it's become.

187
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,880
Tiger Claw on chat says Sonic two made 71 million at the box office more than the first

188
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
movie.

189
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,120
Well, I'm not I'm not terribly surprised.

190
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:33,560
A on the pandemic kind of hobbled the first movie's ability to play more than what one

191
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
weekend.

192
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
That was just before pandemic.

193
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,040
Well, and I think a lot of people ended up seeing the first movie on demand and all that

194
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
stuff.

195
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
So I think this is a very interesting.

196
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,600
I mean, I talk about the pandemic like it's over.

197
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
It's not.

198
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,800
But we have precautions and vaccinations now.

199
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,880
So more people are willing to go out and do these types of things.

200
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,320
So and with everything you were saying, Matt, I think it's not just the directors and the

201
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,520
filmmakers that are the right age.

202
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
But it's the audience.

203
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,400
I mean, you admittedly, you are a perfect example for somebody that loves Sonic growing

204
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
up.

205
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,680
And now you have kids.

206
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,040
That's the thing is I never really played the Sonic games too much aside.

207
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Did you have to?

208
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Did you?

209
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
You know the basics?

210
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,640
You know, the Green Hill Zone melody, you know, Sonic goes fast, like I would bet that

211
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,680
when it comes to the story and the lore, and this is where I think Sonic three and so on

212
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,880
gets in trouble when you get to the more, I don't want to say B tier characters, but

213
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,720
it is what it well, we've all we've had the OLRN joke for forever about Sonic and all

214
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,080
of his shitty friends, right?

215
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:46,640
There's a lot of there's a lot of shitty friends that you know, are Yeah, so anyway.

216
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,800
The only reason I would want to see Sonic to though is because knuckles and who voiced

217
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
him.

218
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,480
He was knuckles was good.

219
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,640
He was a very good character knuckles I've always been a knuckles fan since since knuckles

220
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,600
came out.

221
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,100
So knuckles was my favorite part of playing a Sonic adventure.

222
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,360
Just as long as we don't get all the ones that came later does not necessary All right.

223
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,160
But I like I like like SPO and some of the chaotic characters Yeah, but like, they're

224
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,200
not going to have that same recognition because you have to know the games to know those types

225
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
of characters.

226
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,880
I think when they start getting that deep, it's going to get so difficult.

227
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,800
And I said this last movie, and I'm gonna say it again, because of the end, the end

228
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,720
credit stuff, but like, and this is not spoiler, they do this on both of the movies, they do

229
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,800
like kind of a replay of the movie, but done in the style of the eight big games or 16

230
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,000
big games.

231
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,840
They need to make a Sonic the Hedgehog the movie, like 2d side scrolling game done in

232
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,560
that graphic style, because it's, it's absolutely awesome.

233
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,880
Like it really needs to be a thing.

234
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,240
They need to make a movie.

235
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,960
That's Sonic racing with Danica Patrick starring in it.

236
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,440
She was Oh, yeah, she wasn't.

237
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Yes, she was.

238
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Yes, she was.

239
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,560
Well, that's gonna be the sake multiverse movies when they do one Sonic racing that

240
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:17,320
I care about that Sonic are and they actually get Lady Miss cure somehow to play ooh, la

241
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
la.

242
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,960
I don't care if she's like approaching 60.

243
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,120
At this point, she still needs to play ooh, la la.

244
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,520
It'll be amazing.

245
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,240
Anyway, s2100.

246
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,760
Matt has a great point in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network live on this Sunday night

247
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,600
saying, I will give them props talk about a total reversal, creepy Sonic from the first

248
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,640
movie, redoing Sonic because of it to an actual franchise that's breaking records.

249
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,320
You know what Matt brings up a great point about remember when that first Sonic movie

250
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,040
was in a heap of trouble because of how Sonic looked, and they actually went back and redid

251
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,440
it and now, you know, yeah, good point.

252
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,240
I mean, if they hadn't done that, we probably wouldn't have had this movie make $71 million

253
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,600
because we wouldn't have had it at all if Sonic hadn't hadn't changed from that first

254
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
one.

255
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,200
So that is is kind of an interesting point how that internet rage against the very first

256
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,640
Sonic trailer, maybe, maybe it's an example of internet rage actually doing some good

257
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
in this world.

258
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Who knew?

259
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Who knew?

260
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,800
Although I would pay to see a bad Sonic version of Sonic the movie, you know, just work.

261
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,560
It would be nice to have that cut like that, that extra that Blu ray extra, right?

262
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:32,520
Like that, like the like the cat butthole cut, you know, I need to see the bad Sonic

263
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
cut.

264
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Absolutely.

265
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,040
All right, let's get into some news for the night.

266
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,500
And we're gonna get into the first and I just I just realized you want to hear something

267
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,720
really funny.

268
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,180
I just realized my stream deck is not even plugged in currently, so I can't scroll the

269
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,900
bar on the side.

270
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,380
So please give me a minute.

271
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,220
And we'll get into our first story and pretty soon the bar on the side for those watching

272
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,540
live at Twitch.

273
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,900
We'll catch up.

274
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,300
So let's get into our first story tonight.

275
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,300
Rob.

276
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Yeah.

277
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,800
For the record, Lady Miss Keir has a tumbler.

278
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,180
Who still has a tumbler?

279
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Even the tumbler.

280
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,660
Okay, yeah, I was gonna say, hold on her blog.

281
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,260
Hold up, Lady Miss contrarian because you just talked about your mass affecting tumbler

282
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,620
and how you don't use it anymore.

283
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,580
And you had a lot of people over there.

284
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:26,180
I'd still exist, but she's got a tumbler.

285
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
Interesting.

286
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
All right.

287
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,920
Let's move on to our kickoff topic for the night.

288
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,620
And that is about a game.

289
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,380
I don't think it was one of those.

290
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,940
We weren't expecting it this week.

291
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,940
But here it is.

292
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,940
Right, Loki?

293
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:43,180
Yeah, so we weren't expecting the announcement of Kingdom Hearts four, but that's what we

294
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,100
got a trailer.

295
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,340
And they were doing some 20th anniversary events.

296
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,860
And they wrapped up with the trailer for the new game or I guess sort of an announcement.

297
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,340
And then also an announcement for a game called Kingdom Hearts missing link.

298
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:04,860
I my main gripe right now with Kingdom Hearts four is that logo is awful.

299
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,560
It's awful because it looks like Kingdom.

300
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,420
It looks like Kingdom Hearts three.

301
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
It isn't good.

302
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,420
You're right.

303
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,420
The V look like a V and not just like it looks like Kingdom Hearts three at a glance like

304
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,260
you have to really get in there with a magnifying glass and go Okay, it's for you know, but

305
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,900
it's just, I don't know.

306
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:30,580
Otherwise the game looks I mean, it looks nice source obviously been like, he's looking

307
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,940
more, you know, for delicate as ever.

308
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,260
I mean, I don't know.

309
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,260
I I'm so far removed from Kingdom Hearts right now.

310
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,900
Like I can't even like,

311
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,340
Okay, get into this.

312
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,340
Mike Deft.

313
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,460
Mike never played it.

314
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,580
Mike Deft brings up a good question, which logo is better?

315
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,780
Street Fighter four or excuse me, Street Fighter six or Kingdom Hearts four?

316
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,380
Because I would say Street Fighter six Kingdom Hearts four for that.

317
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,860
Okay, so there's there's difference.

318
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,060
Street Fighter six, they put no effort into it Kingdom Hearts four they put effort into

319
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,060
it.

320
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,900
But like, the font is just bad that like it's just they they need to make a choice.

321
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,180
It was a choice like choices were made.

322
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,340
The arms of the V are vertical like they are parallel with each other.

323
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:23,180
It just it's hard to like I get it stylistic but like maybe make it more like a V. That's

324
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,060
my only complaint is such a minor complaint but it's it is weird because I was looking

325
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
at the logos.

326
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,980
I'm like, why do you have Kingdom Hearts three on there and then I had to like really look

327
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:38,980
at my Oh, that's for Okay, well, cool but so some other things so with the new trailer

328
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:44,300
that they had, they were showing some different kind of scenes that kind of shut off the better

329
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,020
graphics and one of the scenes was like of a creek or something like that.

330
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:56,020
And we see some metal looking thing that could possibly be like an AT AT or ATS t leg or

331
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,260
foot or something.

332
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,060
So folks are saying well, maybe Star Wars is going to be in there which is very possible

333
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,740
considering that Disney does own all of the properties now Star Star Wars making its way

334
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,160
in there would make a lot of sense.

335
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,080
And I thought I haven't hasn't ever had a discussion about that before when the third

336
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,520
game came out because that was right around the time that Disney was buying Star Wars

337
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,400
and there was like mutual interest around trying to do it again to get Avengers two.

338
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,320
I just want more Tron to be honest so same Yeah, yes.

339
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,120
But we'll see also look even more amazing now with all the Yeah, yeah, current gen graphics

340
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,080
deaf to saying Simpsons world and Kingdom Hearts for although that's still all the Disney

341
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,240
own Fox now what doesn't Disney Oh, they do own Jesus.

342
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
We have X.

343
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Oh, that's right.

344
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:48,040
Because Frank inverters world, but then I want my Rocky horror picture show world Transylvania

345
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,400
we need it.

346
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,500
So who I mean, literally anything and everything can be in there.

347
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,480
But it looks like judging for the trailer.

348
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,320
It's more of a and I think the gag would be that it's the real world.

349
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,480
And that maybe it's real world locations.

350
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,240
And that could be very interesting as well.

351
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,280
I think also surprising for a lot of people with the trailer I know it was for me is that

352
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,400
there's gameplay in it or hypothetical gameplay.

353
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,800
One could argue that we're looking at target render with that, that maybe it doesn't actually

354
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
look like that.

355
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:22,220
Yeah, but still, you get the sense that there is, you know, gameplay, you know, you're looking

356
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
at it.

357
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,760
And and the reason why I say it's surprising is because I think most people expected when

358
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,960
they announced Kingdom Hearts for it'll have Sora Donald goofy fade in, fade out logo,

359
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,160
some cryptic thing that doesn't make sense because the story doesn't make sense those

360
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,440
games anyway.

361
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
And then that's it.

362
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,440
We'll see the game in 25 years.

363
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,980
And that's, that's, that's where we figured that but now it's like, oh, it's maybe they

364
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,480
actually have something playable in there.

365
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Wow, okay, maybe we will be seeing this thing a little bit sooner.

366
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,520
Because everybody's been joking about how it's going to be, you know, 50 years before

367
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,660
even I wrote that tweet where I'm like, I can't wait to play it in heaven because I'll

368
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,720
be dead before this thing comes out.

369
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,080
But some folks are saying you know what, maybe it's not going to be so bad.

370
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,480
I guess I guess from Kingdom Hearts three announcement to game arrival was only six

371
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,960
years.

372
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,660
Only just just to put it in perspective.

373
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,920
If this game comes out in only six years, we'll, we'll, we'll be 50 or damn close to

374
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
it.

375
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,640
Getting to play this game.

376
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,720
As soon as I mean, considering that they said they celebrated their 20th anniversary, and

377
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,880
there's only three games out well three, you know, there's more than three there's a start

378
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,320
to see a points out it's the 16th game in the timeline, there's more than three.

379
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,200
It's just the third mainline game, you're forgetting all the line of all that she could

380
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,160
one that I am not going to try to explain on this three hour podcast, because three

381
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,680
hours isn't enough time to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

382
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,040
It's just not to go along with all that.

383
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,240
So because Kingdom Hearts four was, I guess, announced and everything there, folks are

384
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,320
saying that the GeForce now link or leak that had Kingdom Hearts four I guess as part of

385
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,960
that is expected to maybe be true.

386
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,600
I don't know though Kingdom Hearts four seems kind of like an easy guess that there's going

387
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,400
to be a Kingdom Hearts four I mean,

388
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:26,280
it is but I guess you know what wasn't as easy of a guest was Chrono Cross getting remastered.

389
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,000
And it's kind of like it's all happening around the same time.

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,800
And I think that's what's lending itself to this.

391
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
But here's the thing.

392
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,360
Okay, so they talk about a Final Fantasy nine remake, and I feel like everybody's brain

393
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,640
is going to what they did with Final Fantasy seven remake.

394
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,880
And I'm like, hold your horses, people.

395
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,440
Hold your horses.

396
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,780
Because who's to say the Final Fantasy nine remake isn't going to look like the Final

397
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,100
Fantasy eight remaster or whatever it is they did recently.

398
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,240
And that is it's kind of garbage.

399
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,840
Like I'm sorry, and that isn't me trying to dig on the game because you all know, I don't

400
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,320
care for the gameplay and Final Fantasy eight, the plot is fine.

401
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,640
I don't care for the gameplay.

402
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,640
But I mean, playing it on because it was on Xbox Game Pass not that long ago, it looked

403
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,200
like duty kaka because you had these like new sprites on blurred backgrounds.

404
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,000
It just it was really not a good look.

405
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,280
And I'm understanding again, I don't want to pick a fresh wound.

406
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,960
But a lot of the feedback I'm hearing on Chrono Cross is that it's in a similar place.

407
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,800
So I worry the Final Fantasy nine is going to be ending up this direction as well, in

408
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,760
which case hard pass.

409
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,600
It doesn't look like it's worth the restoration to be honest.

410
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,800
So I didn't even play it the first time.

411
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,120
Oh, Final Fantasy nine.

412
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,280
Yeah, I started it and it was so boring.

413
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,240
It like I think the game plays better than eight, but y'all know how I feel about eight,

414
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,000
but I do have a better story.

415
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,040
I do agree that the plot for nine is it just doesn't hold up in your memory as well as

416
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,640
almost any of the other games in the franchise save for maybe like two and 15.

417
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,080
I didn't care about the story in nine.

418
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Exactly.

419
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,160
I didn't care about the characters.

420
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
They were not engaging.

421
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
Yeah.

422
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
I kind of agree with you on that.

423
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,480
And I that was one of the games I did pick that up right at launch too.

424
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,640
And I remember playing it going, Oh, I was expecting more seven and eight.

425
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,240
This is all right, I guess.

426
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,160
But now Final Fantasy nine could also be a middle ground.

427
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:35,640
And I would say that's the live a live route where they're using the engine for triangle

428
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,040
strategy and Octopath Traveler and all that.

429
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,680
I think that would be great.

430
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,200
However, my I want to see that was six.

431
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,040
Well, I need to see that was six or four.

432
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,120
My only concern with that is that live alive was a Super Nintendo game.

433
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,760
And that engine looks to be a little better at adapting Super Nintendo stuff.

434
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,480
But I'm also not a programmer.

435
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,880
So I don't want to sit here and say it's easier or harder.

436
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,520
I just if Final Fantasy nine were to look like that live live reboot, I think that would

437
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,360
do a lot more justice.

438
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,480
But I also agree with what you're saying, Loki, is that I would far more want to see

439
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,160
four or five and six all done in that engine first.

440
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:21,320
And honestly, and this may shock you, I would love to see Chrono Trigger in that engine

441
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,720
as well.

442
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,520
So I hope that live alive does very well for them.

443
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,640
And they are convinced to put more of the Super Nintendo catalog in there.

444
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,000
And then there's Oh, gosh, there's also those rumors about Enix titles that were under consideration

445
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,880
at one point.

446
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,240
Do you know, I, I will put out for the quintet trilogy to come back.

447
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,440
Brain Lord and Terran.

448
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,400
I will put out like, show me who I have to put it.

449
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,520
I will do it.

450
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,840
I will do and you're welcome next.

451
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,640
It's, it's such a good trilogy.

452
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,960
And I would love those.

453
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Those games really need to come back.

454
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,920
I mean, like Final Fantasy six, Final Fantasy four.

455
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,200
I love those games.

456
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,240
They literally just got re released.

457
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,920
You know, whether, whether you cared for the re release or not, they literally just

458
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,960
got re released.

459
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,920
So we probably don't need to revisit those games again for five years.

460
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,400
Gaia, Terranigma.

461
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,320
Those games have never been touched since the Super Nintendo days.

462
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,280
Never been touched.

463
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,560
So I think those games are due.

464
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,960
So fingers and toes crossed, to be honest.

465
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,600
S2 100.

466
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,080
Matt in chat says, I feel like Final Fantasy nine came out at the end of the PlayStation

467
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,480
one life cycle, which at that point I moved on to Dreamcast and other stuff.

468
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,520
Well, that's a lot of the problem.

469
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,080
Final Fantasy 12 faced is it came out at the end of the PlayStation two life cycle.

470
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,320
Not every PlayStation three could play PlayStation two stuff.

471
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,280
And a lot of people were going to Xbox 360 at that point.

472
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,880
So a lot of people miss Final Fantasy 12.

473
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,400
So 12 really didn't get its due until the, the remaster they did recently.

474
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,200
And, you know, honestly, a lot of the work that the team did on Final Fantasy 14, because

475
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,960
it's the same business unit within Square Enix that did 12.

476
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,360
I don't think it's technically the same business, but a lot of the same people that did 12 did

477
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,080
14.

478
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,840
And there's a lot with that.

479
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:22,680
So anyway, so the earlier Nvidia leak, honestly, it's probably it's true.

480
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,600
Let's just let it's true, but I'm more excited for the tactics.

481
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:27,960
Now.

482
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,680
Now there's, there's a game for live, alive.

483
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,920
I was like, there's the game that, and that it's, it's sure.

484
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,240
Okay.

485
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,040
We, we had advance on, um, the Game Boy advance.

486
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,540
You know what?

487
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,520
Final Fantasy Tactics.

488
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,020
It's time.

489
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,600
Let's, let's, let's do that one in the live, alive engine.

490
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,120
I'd be very happy about that.

491
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,200
I don't even like tactical games.

492
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,640
That one I really like.

493
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,960
So there's that.

494
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,460
All right.

495
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,100
Let's talk about other things we like in our gaming week with a segment that we call.

496
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,140
How was your gaming week?

497
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,260
Where we talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

498
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,900
Dark soccer.

499
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,540
I'll start with you.

500
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,300
Um, I'm playing, uh, taking density three.

501
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,820
Uh, I should be done with it soon.

502
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,620
Come to think of it.

503
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,700
Um, I just got flammie.

504
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,380
I was so excited to get flammie.

505
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,820
I peeked at your stream last night for a hot minute and I could tell you're close to the

506
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,320
end.

507
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,520
Yeah.

508
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,760
Um, I, uh, word.

509
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:36,400
I'm also playing, um, dead by daylight and I actually had like the most amazing round

510
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,760
of pig games and then I played somebody else and it was kind of crap, but all my pig games

511
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,640
were great.

512
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,040
And then I made friends in one of my last pig games cause it turned into a boop match.

513
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:53,440
And if anyone doesn't know what boop in the snoot is, go look it up.

514
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,280
Cause I had many, many snoot boops.

515
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,120
Um, and I made friends with, with like the entire party.

516
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,400
So it was pretty great.

517
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,960
Um, other than that, I've just been prepping stuff up for my birthday marathon on Thursday

518
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,880
and you know, just trying to think of welts I'm going to be playing as I am going to do

519
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,320
Terranigma next.

520
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,200
And I've just been getting things prepped up for that and need to go find sprites to

521
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,560
do my chat windows and whatnot.

522
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,060
But yeah.

523
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,720
Well, good luck with the, uh, birthday marathon on Thursday.

524
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,160
So, uh, if I can stay awake, I can barely keep my eyes open now.

525
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,400
Hope you get cake or whatever it is you desire.

526
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:34,880
I bought myself a cake.

527
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,680
Uh, what kind of cake?

528
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,640
A little chocolate torte.

529
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,180
Yummy.

530
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,240
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

531
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,560
Uh, mostly Minecraft.

532
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,760
As usual, I've been just working on prepping stuff for future episodes and all that.

533
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,600
Uh, I don't remember this week was look at the calendar here.

534
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,080
I think I did some of the April fool's stuff this week.

535
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,400
Yeah.

536
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Cause we, we had our, I did a late roll fools stuff.

537
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,120
So I was pulling pranks, I guess, on our server, um, doing different things with that.

538
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,200
So I put out a video about that and that was fun.

539
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,640
Uh, I did play something else other than just Minecraft.

540
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,200
I checked out cause I saw another YouTuber playing it, uh, Ali 43.

541
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,920
There was this game called instruments of destruction.

542
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,880
It's kind of like, um, Oh God, I don't even remember the original game now.

543
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,440
Um, it's basically a game where you build machines that can break stuff and then you

544
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,920
drive them through these islands and you break stuff with them.

545
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,840
So it's all physics based.

546
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,360
Um, you've got like a saw blades and stuff you can put on your machines, wrecking balls

547
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
and all sorts of things in it.

548
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,320
Everything breaks really nice.

549
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
There's lots of physics involved with everything.

550
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,920
So it just looks really cool.

551
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,280
So I checked it out and it's all right.

552
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,840
It, it, I don't know if I play it for a long time, but it's, it's okay.

553
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,680
I'm really now I'm kind of bothered cause I don't remember what that other game I'm

554
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,960
thinking of was.

555
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,200
There was another one though, similar kind of style where you didn't really like the

556
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,800
break things you had to like defeat an army of like, it's like a medieval thing.

557
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,480
I don't remember his call though, but, um, both fun.

558
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,840
So yeah, check it out if you like that kind of, you know, physics based stuff.

559
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,120
It's still an early access, but it's only like 20 bucks.

560
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,080
So it's not bad.

561
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,560
Uh, that's it.

562
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,320
I didn't get to play as any DDR this week because it was a little warm.

563
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,000
It was like, we're almost 90.

564
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,040
So the garage, right?

565
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Uh, this week should be a little bit better than this.

566
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,200
Hopefully I'll get into a little bit of that.

567
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,880
It's supposed to be in the sixties tomorrow.

568
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,760
Yeah.

569
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,680
And for like the early part of the week too.

570
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,040
So looking forward to that, what's that game?

571
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I don't know why I'm going through my steam library.

572
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,040
Like, Oh, there it is.

573
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,560
Like I'm going to find it amongst all these like 700 games that are in here.

574
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,320
But, um, yeah, that was, it's a fun game.

575
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,360
Just check it out though.

576
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,860
Right.

577
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,300
Uh, my gaming week, um, I have a confession to make.

578
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,020
This is, this is hard.

579
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,060
Okay.

580
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,260
Um, this week I, I played Fortnite.

581
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,260
I don't know why I, I've seen a lot.

582
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:26,820
Okay.

583
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,500
I can try Roblox next.

584
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,060
I've seen a lot of, a lot of my friends play Fortnite.

585
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,220
I've seen a lot of, like, it seems to be having this weird resurgence on Twitch lately.

586
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,660
Well, it's actually, no, it's not weird.

587
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,260
I'm telling you what the secret sauce is.

588
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,660
It's the no build mode is that now everybody is like, Oh, Fortnite's interesting again.

589
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,300
Which is funny because you know, a lot of the Fortnite faithful were like, Oh, they're

590
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,580
going to add this mode that just makes it generically like every other shooter.

591
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,260
And that's going to make the game more interesting.

592
00:30:53,380 --> 00:31:00,100
Yeah, yeah, it is actually because the building thing put a lot of people off and yeah, the

593
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,500
fact that now it's just like every other shooter.

594
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:09,540
So it's easier to get into, but it's every other shooter with Ariana Grande, the Marvel

595
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:15,700
cinematic universe, Assassin's Creed characters, the kitchen sink, whatever else they're throwing

596
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,660
at this game.

597
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,340
It actually makes it kind of interesting.

598
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,900
So, um, yeah, I've been playing a little bit of Fortnite.

599
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,820
Actually, it's the creative mode for me and it's, it's interesting.

600
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,460
I give Epic games a lot of shit and rightfully so let's be clear.

601
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,660
Tim Sweeney is kind of an asshole on social media.

602
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,380
Like I'm just I'm just he's kind of an asshole on social media.

603
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,260
But I can't ignore that he created ZZT, right?

604
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:48,660
Which which is a retro game that a lot of us hold in high fucking regard, right is ZZT.

605
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:55,540
And it's interesting because when I play creative mode in Fortnite, I see those little glimpses

606
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,260
of ZZT.

607
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:04,020
Like, and I kind of go, I see, I see how we got from that to this.

608
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,580
Not that I'm saying Fortnite's as good as ZZT, nothing's ever going to live up to those

609
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,780
memories from those days.

610
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,580
But I see how we got from that to this.

611
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,860
And I think it's kind of interesting.

612
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,260
I don't know.

613
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:23,140
So there's been that I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14 because there's finally the

614
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,220
new patch, the first Endwalker patch is out on Tuesday.

615
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,780
And I'm really hyped for it because we really don't know where the story is going next.

616
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,300
You know, because they wrapped everything up at the end of the patch 6.0.

617
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,380
I've also really enjoyed in the past couple weeks, I really like to watch reaction videos

618
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,020
to a few of the big cutscenes towards the end of Endwalker.

619
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,860
I won't repeat because I know not everybody here has played it.

620
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,860
But there's some very key cutscenes towards the end of the game and watching people's

621
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,380
reaction to them just they get very sad.

622
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,660
And then I get very sad.

623
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,140
And it's this very interesting sort of therapy thing.

624
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,940
So I'm really excited for some news story and to see what we can react to next in that

625
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:12,340
game because they really did kind of close up most of the loose ends at the end of Endwalker.

626
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,380
So be curious to see where they go next.

627
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:21,700
So Zen Monkey 11 in chat says, Wait a minute, this is the first time I'm hearing this, they

628
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,980
remove the building in the game?

629
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,340
Or is it just a new mode?

630
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,860
If they remove the building, that's done.

631
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,140
That was the main thing I liked about it.

632
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,020
It is a new mode.

633
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,540
So when you go to select like, do you want to play squad?

634
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,420
Do you want to play?

635
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,100
You can also play zero build is a new mode they put in it.

636
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,260
And there's a lot of people that are into that.

637
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,500
So yeah, it's just a new mode.

638
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,500
So if you if you're a building loyalist, then you still have your thing.

639
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,540
Don't worry about it.

640
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:51,860
I think for a temporary amount of time, zero build was the only way to play but that's

641
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,420
that's done.

642
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,740
So that's that on Fortnite.

643
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,060
Fifth Dream says I want to come back to Final Fantasy 14 when more stuff is soloable in

644
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,860
future patches.

645
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,460
Well, that's one of the big things about this patch they're putting out is that I believe

646
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,100
the entirety of a realm reborn is now soloable.

647
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,340
So all of those dungeons they've remade to be trust dungeons.

648
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:24,500
They are completely redoing the end game story dungeons, the Praetorium and Castrum meridian

649
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,380
are now four player not eight player and you can run them with trust.

650
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,060
So yeah, so they're there.

651
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,300
Realm Reborn I think is going to be 100% soloable.

652
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:41,460
I might be wrong in that you might have to do a couple of fights still in a party but

653
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,500
it should be very minimal.

654
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,140
So I think it's interesting.

655
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,420
And that's the part that's free to play too, which is even more interesting.

656
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,860
So I think they let the free to play players back in.

657
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,420
Yes, they did.

658
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:52,920
They did.

659
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:57,060
So otherwise, I've been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight.

660
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,060
I was giggling when Dark Soccer was talking about the pig boops that she was giving out

661
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,660
because I booped a pig.

662
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,380
That was the first time that I had a pig and not try to kill me and I was able to sneak

663
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,700
up and go boop on the snoot and then run out the door.

664
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,900
Did you boop a pig and you liked it?

665
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,220
I did.

666
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,100
I did boop the pig and they could have killed me.

667
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,380
They actually knocked me out.

668
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,300
Oh, I know why they were mad.

669
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,940
They couldn't find me the entire match.

670
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,100
The other three died and finally this pig finds me.

671
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,340
I'm really good at hiding and being immersed.

672
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,620
The pig knocked me out just because they wanted to put a party hat on me, which if you've

673
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,700
seen the movie Saw, you know what the party hats are.

674
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,780
They're not party hats.

675
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,940
Actually, it was only ever on one character.

676
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,420
I think it was in the first movie and it was on Amanda.

677
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,380
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

678
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,340
They use their trap.

679
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,780
They use it again later for sure.

680
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,140
I don't want to spoil, but I didn't watch.

681
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,020
I didn't care about any of this, but I think they only used it like one other time.

682
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
At least twice that I know of in the canon.

683
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:03,060
It wasn't like I don't think people who don't play Dead by Daylight are going to understand

684
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,260
what the party hat is.

685
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,980
Oh, yeah.

686
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,060
So it's the reverse bear trap thing.

687
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:14,500
So anyway, my point is the pig put that thing on and then allowed me to get out and crawl

688
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,620
out or whatever.

689
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,980
And then I was able to boop the snoot and run out, which I forgot.

690
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,740
I didn't know you could leave the party hat on.

691
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,380
I thought you couldn't, but I guess you can after all the gens are done.

692
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,740
Yeah, if you get the hat on after the gens are done, you can safely leave or you can

693
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,500
leave the hatch with it.

694
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,180
Okay, that's why.

695
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:38,020
Which is why, like, the only time I'll ever do it after after gens are done is just for

696
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,740
blood points.

697
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,540
Got it.

698
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,040
Okay.

699
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,500
And that was really it for my gaming week.

700
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,780
I really have a lot else.

701
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:49,540
So let's get into some gaming news and talk about what is going on around the industry.

702
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,460
And we will start with Loki.

703
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,580
That game I was thinking of, by the way, was Besiege.

704
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,620
That was that was very similar.

705
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,120
Okay.

706
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:04,840
Anyways, so here's some good news about Activision Blizzard for change.

707
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,240
We're in, you know, backwards world now.

708
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,440
Apparently 1100 workers are going to be moved to full time roles.

709
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,400
This is their US based QA workers.

710
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,640
They are no longer going to be contract employees.

711
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,880
They're going to be full time employees with benefits starting July 1st.

712
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:32,920
I'm thinking this is to try to quell additional unions, but good, I guess, because I know

713
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,880
the QA workers on as part of Raven had, I believe, try the former union as a big strike.

714
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,520
And then, yeah, so but at least you know that the QA employees are going to be moved to

715
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,080
full time.

716
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:52,280
They're going to be paid 20 or at minimum, I guess, $20 an hour.

717
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,800
Good.

718
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,640
Seems kind of low for QA work, but okay.

719
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,000
But once again, I think it's just throwing them a bone.

720
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,720
I say good because the fact that they're setting that means that doesn't exist now.

721
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,120
So it's coming up.

722
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,640
They're being paid even less.

723
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,640
But on top of all that, though, like probably with a union, you could have got more.

724
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,080
But yeah, something is better than nothing.

725
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,400
Well, and it's also nice to see the benefits.

726
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,840
It's nice to see that a lot of the action that the employees have worked hard with the

727
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,560
organization efforts that they have done thus far have resulted in meaningful change.

728
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,960
Some may argue how meaningful this is, but it is change in the direction that people

729
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,680
wanted to see it.

730
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:46,200
And let's be honest, we would not be talking about this whatsoever right now if employees

731
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,320
hadn't taken the first steps to ask for that or to demand that change.

732
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,520
So it's just still unionized, though, on top of that.

733
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,080
Oh, of course.

734
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,680
But you're right that a lot of these things are probably in an effort to prevent that

735
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,720
from happening, I guess.

736
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:07,640
But anyhow, let's move on and talk about PlayStation Plus, which I believe we talked

737
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,560
a little bit about last week about how it is confirmed there's going to be that whole

738
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,640
three tier system for PlayStation Plus.

739
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,080
It's basically a lot of PlayStation now that already exists, but now with a lot of retro

740
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,680
game, a lot more retro games.

741
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,960
And a lot of people are wondering what type of retro games.

742
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,440
Well, on the official PlayStation podcast this week, Jim Ryan, the boss of PlayStation,

743
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,880
was a guest, as you would expect on the official PlayStation podcast from time to time, and

744
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,760
said that subscribers can look forward to, here's the quote, all the big names.

745
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,880
So when a question was asked, the reply, quote, massive publisher participation.

746
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,040
We have all the big names present.

747
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,480
We have big publishers.

748
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,240
We have small indie publishers.

749
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,960
We have over 200 partners working with us to put their content into PlayStation Plus.

750
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
So the lineup is going to be really strong.

751
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:07,720
Now, here's the thing, if they're even missing one game, we know the internet people, we

752
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,960
know social media people, they are going to fixate on that one game.

753
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,120
I know this internet.

754
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,480
I've been around this internet for a long time, y'all.

755
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,320
And it'll be interesting to see all those Activision games in there.

756
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,600
The internet will absolutely fixate on what games are missing.

757
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,000
Or are they going to be in there?

758
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,600
Oh, Activision?

759
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,640
I would assume so.

760
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,000
I would assume so.

761
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,080
Sure.

762
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,600
Because games pass.

763
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,480
I would think that'd make it look much more, they'll be on their platform, but maybe not

764
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,680
necessarily part of Plus.

765
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,640
I think it'll be there.

766
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,800
Because it's still some money and it's better than no money, which is what those games are

767
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,920
otherwise making.

768
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:02,280
So, but of course, it also is kind of confirmed those games will, or PlayStation Plus, the

769
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,280
new version is not going to be first party launches.

770
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,400
So whereas Xbox Game Pass has Starfield, Halo Infinite coming out day one, don't expect

771
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,360
God of War Ragnarok to come out on PlayStation Plus.

772
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,920
In the interview, Jim Ryan said, the games that we make are getting bigger.

773
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,120
They're getting better.

774
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,560
They're getting more beautiful.

775
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,680
They're getting richer.

776
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,520
The narrative is getting stronger.

777
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,400
Putting these games into a subscription service immediately upon their release would break

778
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,840
this virtuous circle.

779
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,120
And we wouldn't be able to invest in the way that we're currently able to.

780
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,480
So we're not doing it.

781
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,400
We're going to stick to the approach that we have and has served us well under many

782
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:41,960
years now.

783
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,240
And by they're getting richer, they mean Sony's getting richer because of their $70

784
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:53,160
price point and, you know, games, you know, different season passes and microtransactions

785
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,840
and that kind of stuff that they have to walk back later on after it becomes really

786
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,320
terrible.

787
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,040
You said it with microtransactions, because here's the thing.

788
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:08,120
If this, well, if these games like God of War Ragnarok have non-meaningful DLC in it.

789
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,800
And when I say that, I mean, like, non, I mean, DLC that is not an extensive story

790
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,600
addition.

791
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:20,520
If it has non-meaningful DLC in it, then that whole statement is bullshit in my opinion.

792
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,640
If God of War Ragnarok has a season pass, that's a bullshit statement.

793
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,600
Now, because like Gran Turismo, like, for example, it did that.

794
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,600
Well, but well, they're paying for it now, aren't they?

795
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,160
Because it's that one's pretty much universally lauded as the worst in the series at this

796
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,480
point.

797
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,240
So there is that.

798
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:49,560
Also, I thought I was going to say with oh, with Microsoft.

799
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:56,520
We see that there are things like, you know, Forza Horizon 4, as brilliant of a game as

800
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,400
that is, there is no shortage of DLC in that game.

801
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,120
Halo Infinite season pass.

802
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,160
So Microsoft does monetize it in other ways.

803
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,760
So that's why I'm kind of putting that AMB comparison there.

804
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:17,480
Because again, in Jim Ryan's words, we wouldn't be able to invest in the way that we're

805
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,440
currently able to.

806
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,960
But it's a season pass for Halo for single player or for multiplayer multiplayer, because

807
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,760
multiplayer is free.

808
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:25,720
Right.

809
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,960
But then there's season pass for cosmetics on top of that.

810
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,880
Well, that makes sense.

811
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,720
If it's a free to play game, right?

812
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,960
Not a $70 game that Sony is charging for the racing sim.

813
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,680
So yeah, no, that's true.

814
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,000
So I will be even take something like I don't know, like Forza Horizon 4, or whatever it

815
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,160
is, is that Forza Horizon 4 is bad.

816
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,160
Yeah, as far as microtransactions.

817
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,540
Yeah.

818
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:51,900
Okay.

819
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,760
Sorry, I keep Jamie.

820
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,040
Jeremy, every time you get up and walk away, it screws up my Discord thing.

821
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,600
Sorry.

822
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,360
Just are you back?

823
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,840
Okay, I don't think she's back.

824
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,340
All right.

825
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,800
Anyway, Bobby Black Wolf does point out Forza Horizon 5 actually doesn't have any DLC yet.

826
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:18,600
What about the map and all that stuff that isn't in that game?

827
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,760
Like the pay to unlock the entire map and all that stuff?

828
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,880
Oh, all right.

829
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,560
I guess I'm misremembering.

830
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,800
I thought there was like cars and stuff.

831
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,200
Oh, yeah, the treasure map.

832
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,800
Okay, so there's at least something in there.

833
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,760
Okay, there's no new car packs yet.

834
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,160
All right.

835
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:37,400
All right.

836
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,760
That's what the chat is filling me in on.

837
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,480
Okay.

838
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:39,880
All right.

839
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

840
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,960
Let's go to our next story.

841
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,600
Dark Sakura.

842
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,520
I need I need a moment.

843
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,000
Sorry.

844
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,500
Sure.

845
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,320
Let's see if there's other comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

846
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,560
Where?

847
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,600
Yeah, SJ100 Matt's confirming getting paid to unlock the map.

848
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,960
Oh, Mike Deft is bringing up Chocobo GP.

849
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,240
Oh, yes.

850
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,840
Oh, yeah, that game.

851
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,360
But I mean, technically, that game exists in a free to play mode.

852
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,880
But they still it's still bad, even on the paid mode or whatever.

853
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,720
They still have like a ton of the microtransactions stuff in there.

854
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,240
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I still paid $100 for her for horizon five, even though

855
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,160
I have game pass, but I'm weird.

856
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,520
Yeah, no, it's your money.

857
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,720
Spend it on how you want.

858
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:41,000
I think one of the smart things Microsoft did was that whole like three days of early

859
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,560
access, because you know, people will pay extra money to be able to play it first.

860
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,720
And I think that's they're not the first to do it.

861
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,320
We've seen that we've seen that for worse as well on EA side, when they put out like

862
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:58,200
Mass Effect Andromeda early, and just enough in time for people to find all the bugs and

863
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,320
shine a light on it.

864
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,920
But for Forza Horizon five was ready for prime time.

865
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,200
That was the difference.

866
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,320
So there was that.

867
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,720
Um, okay.

868
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,280
Okay, I guess I could talk about this while we wait for Jamie.

869
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,120
Pod culture and chat chat says fill time and tell us about the new thing that you and Alan

870
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,760
picked up.

871
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,720
Okay, I will.

872
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:27,160
Here's the I've been hesitant to talk extensively about it because we are in the process of

873
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,520
adopting a cat.

874
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,640
So you'll notice I didn't say we adopted a cat.

875
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,040
We're in the process of adopting a cat.

876
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,920
Because we're doing that whole trial run thing.

877
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,760
We did identify a cat who has a very similar story to Mr. Smoosh.

878
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,720
And yes, everything's fine with Mr. Smoosh.

879
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,680
We've always just wanted to have more than one cat.

880
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,400
And now that we have a house with no landlord to tell us how many cats we can and can't

881
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:53,880
have.

882
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,840
I mean, we know we should probably limit ourselves.

883
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,520
We shouldn't have like 20 cats.

884
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,520
I want to that might that might be a problem.

885
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,480
But two cats.

886
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,160
That's reason two cats is reasonable.

887
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,480
I would say three is about the most two is reasonable for me.

888
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,520
Everybody's different.

889
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,640
I don't run your life.

890
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,680
But for us, you know, in this house, two or three is fine.

891
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,040
So yes, we are trial running a new cat.

892
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,080
His name is cheddar.

893
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,800
We didn't name him, but he's a Japanese bobtail cat.

894
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:28,360
So he has more of like a bunny rabbit tail than a full cat tail.

895
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:35,000
So he was called cheddar, because whoever found that cat originally because cheddar

896
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,600
is six years old at this point.

897
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,520
And that's another reason why we wanted to try to adopt cheddar is because not a lot

898
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,080
of people adopt adult cats.

899
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,080
But Smoosh is seven or eight.

900
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,320
So we wanted to get a cat that was around smoosh his age and he has a real similar story

901
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,400
where cheddar was abandoned for my story.

902
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,880
Okay, I'll get to you in just a sec because now I'm talking to this other thing.

903
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,080
So cheddar, you know, has this story.

904
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,760
And so we're trial running to see if cheddar will work out.

905
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,360
He's been he's a very shy boy, and he's been very, very shy and skittish.

906
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,280
He has not been using the litter box.

907
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,200
I think he finally did last night, but he's barely eating or drinking.

908
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,880
He's just a scared little boy, or big boy at this point.

909
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,200
So I'm hoping soon, we can mix cheddar and smoosh.

910
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,920
But, you know, we got to wait for cheddar to get a little more comfortable before we

911
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,360
put the stress of another cat.

912
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,040
So everybody cross your fingers and toes.

913
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,840
Dark soccer got to meet cheddar today because she was by the house.

914
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,400
So hopefully, yeah, hopefully everybody likes cheddar.

915
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,600
So all right, let's go to the next story dark soccer.

916
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:52,120
So there have been reports of GameStop call, you know, various GameStop stores calling

917
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:58,040
customers and canceling their preorders of the Amico from Intellivision.

918
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:06,120
There's emails and screenshots up and the email reads, Dear so and so, due to vendor

919
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,520
cancellation, we will be unable to fulfill your order number, etc.

920
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,160
We will be canceling your order and you will not be charged.

921
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,920
Also, members of the Intellivision Amico club have been reporting that their orders were

922
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,720
also canceled.

923
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:27,560
And the it's a big red flag.

924
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:36,360
And so basically, I think that they're realizing that they weren't getting the investments

925
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,480
in it that they needed to have to be able to fulfill the orders.

926
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,280
So yeah, it's it's pretty much going to be gone.

927
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,560
What's interesting is that and I've made it no secret on this program, I preordered

928
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,000
Amico, you know, it was in a very different place two years ago.

929
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,320
And it's it's interesting.

930
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:03,080
I I'm not going to be like the biggest Intellivision or Amico defender in this world.

931
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,560
But what I find interesting is the massive hate boner people have for Tommy Tallarico

932
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,080
and really want to see him fail.

933
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,640
Even though he's no longer involved, essentially, at this point, people really want to see him

934
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,140
fail.

935
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:21,960
And in my mind, that completely disregards a lot of the independent developers who wanted

936
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,240
to make games for this thing.

937
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,760
And a lot of you know, that that end of it.

938
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:33,080
And there was a lot of interesting, I think, methodologies into the developments of the

939
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,160
games to this console where I wanted to see where it would kind of turn out.

940
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,240
And I thought it was going to be interesting.

941
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:46,280
Again, that vision was a lot different in February of 2020 than where we're at now with

942
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,560
all that's happened since then.

943
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,040
So, you know, I at this point, I assume I'm not seeing my $100.

944
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,360
Again, that that here we go again, I should have learned my Kickstarter lesson, I should

945
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,960
never back these things ever back these things.

946
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,360
And I swear I won't ever again until there is actually a product.

947
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,720
No, until there is actually a product on the table.

948
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,160
That's why I didn't even back the new Yacht Club Games thing.

949
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,920
And I'm sure they'll deliver on that.

950
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,720
But I'm just sick and fucking tired of Kickstarter.

951
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,840
And things like it.

952
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,080
I am sick and fucking tired of it.

953
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:28,040
So like, I'm not going to do any more these things until we actually have like, like,

954
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,400
it's got to be for publishing or something where that is what the Kickstarter is backing,

955
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,560
that there's an actual finished product ready to go.

956
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:41,480
I'm pissed off that we had somebody on this show that was making a game on Kickstarter.

957
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,400
That game still isn't fucking out.

958
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,040
I'm not having Kickstarter guests on this show ever again.

959
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,720
So I say that and then fast forward to a year from now we have one on.

960
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,720
But if it's again, if it's somebody I know, might be different.

961
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,000
And somebody again, where there's like publishing and that whole thing.

962
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,720
It depends how much of a kickstart they need.

963
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,280
I'm willing to consider on a case by case basis.

964
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,720
But you know, I think I kind of I've learned my lesson time and time again.

965
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,000
I've also been asked, if the amico comes out, will you still want one?

966
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,480
Yeah, I do.

967
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,400
Because now we're at the point where this is like the 3DO.

968
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,640
And it's like, it's going to be a collector's item.

969
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,160
So yeah, I want an amico.

970
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,800
I just don't think I'm getting one.

971
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,880
I have not gotten one of these emails, though, which is and I did not order through GameStop

972
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,200
I ordered directly through Intellivision's website.

973
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,120
But you even said there a lot of the people in the Intellivision got any I didn't get an email.

974
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,520
And I was listening to Bobby's show tonight.

975
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,400
And I know he backed it.

976
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,600
He didn't get an email either.

977
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,720
So there's a weird circle of people that didn't get this.

978
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,760
Maybe it's on its way.

979
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,880
Maybe next week, I'll be like, well, the email came in, y'all.

980
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,200
Um, but it's because they have the date, the release date.

981
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:52,600
I don't know.

982
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,960
I'm assuming this placeholder for the 31st of March.

983
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,160
And they had a thing where it actually charged people for their preorder.

984
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:06,440
It charged them the full amount because, you know, it was set to come out already.

985
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,600
But then the vendor didn't update the date.

986
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,760
And I'm guessing they don't have an updated date for it.

987
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,760
That's why they're refunding them.

988
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,240
Because amico is certainly not refunding people, even if you ask for a refund.

989
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:23,480
So if you have one preordered through other means, stop that payment ASAP, because you're

990
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,080
not going to get your money back otherwise.

991
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:30,360
And they're the reason I think people are mad at taught me to go, not necessarily because

992
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,480
they just want to see him fail.

993
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:37,080
It's because he's been basically not addressing issues with or concerns that people have and

994
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,680
just calling people haters.

995
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,920
And also just straight up lying about what the system can do when it's available, what

996
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:49,880
you know, everything just hyping the thing up to a ridiculous point and having nothing

997
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,840
to show for it.

998
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:56,680
They just put out an unboxing video to try to secure even more investments right now.

999
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,400
Probably, I think there's somebody in Germany that they're trying to secure investments

1000
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,720
for to make it look like it's an actual product.

1001
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,720
But this product isn't even a thing.

1002
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,480
It didn't come off the assembly line.

1003
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,000
It's a prototype that they've had in their office, but they're passing it off.

1004
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,400
It's like, look, see, the product's almost ready to go.

1005
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,720
It's a bunch of bullshit.

1006
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,440
Here's the thing.

1007
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,640
That's why people are mad at him.

1008
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,600
He's and he's not the first carnival barker in this industry.

1009
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,080
Let's be real.

1010
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,440
There's a lot of them out there.

1011
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,120
A lot of carnival barkers in the industry.

1012
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,440
I think there's a sense of pride with this whole they got screwed by the, you know, the

1013
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,880
computer chip people, because that's that's the core problem at the end of the day here.

1014
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,680
No, it's not.

1015
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,000
You know what?

1016
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,480
No, what they got screwed by is their stupid idea, their stupid business decisions.

1017
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,040
They literally have taken out a loan from one of the shareholders.

1018
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:49,240
It's one of the people that's on the board where they have in order to pay it back.

1019
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:55,480
They have to take $100 off of or they have to take $100 for every unit sold.

1020
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,440
How are you going to make any profit on a console?

1021
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,920
Consoles don't have that kind of margin as it is.

1022
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,160
So that's doomed to failure right there.

1023
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,800
They're just trying to make the company look, you know, good enough to sell it off is what

1024
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,840
they're going to do.

1025
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,520
So it's it's just bad.

1026
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,280
There's a lot of just bad stuff.

1027
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,720
I've been following it and it's all bad.

1028
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,560
There's nothing good from it.

1029
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,920
Well, but also, you know, again, there were people that were developing for this thing

1030
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,520
that were like, you know, the people that were making that breakout redo, that is essentially

1031
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,040
the bit trip gang.

1032
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,280
You know, they were putting out what looked like a pretty quality product for that console.

1033
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,040
No matter how you feel about it.

1034
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,040
That game looks like it was, you know, making the best of it by the way.

1035
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:40,920
Oh, did it really?

1036
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,560
I actually didn't know that platforms already.

1037
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,720
It's that that's a telltale sign.

1038
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,000
Slightly different.

1039
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,960
You know, yeah, that's why that game looked good, because it was already being developed

1040
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,160
for other platforms.

1041
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,120
Tommy wanted everything to be exclusive to their platform.

1042
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,760
But that also could mean that it's an exclusive mode that's in there or something like that.

1043
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,760
But it would have a certain gameplay option.

1044
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:06,680
There was was that was that was the backing down because his his big mouth got him into

1045
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,800
trouble, right?

1046
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:15,320
The moon later game that he had or whatever, their couch co-op mode in that is that each

1047
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,440
person gets a different button they use to control the thing.

1048
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,960
So one person may move left, one person may move right, one person may jump, the other

1049
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,800
person may do something else.

1050
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,760
That's stupid.

1051
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,760
It's absolutely dumb like that.

1052
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,520
That's their big selling point of about this couch co-op and bringing the family together

1053
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,400
and stuff.

1054
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,680
And I whatever, none of these games are coming out.

1055
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,200
I don't even know why we're concerned with stuff.

1056
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,680
And the fact that they sold these NFT things for games that they know are never going to

1057
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,720
be released.

1058
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,760
That's ridiculous.

1059
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,360
Somebody saw dollar signs in that.

1060
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,440
That's all this NFT ever is, is that people that's why celebs are getting involved.

1061
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,560
They just see dollar signs.

1062
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,200
That's all they see.

1063
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,240
That was that was an escape hatch for Intellivision to get these funding issues.

1064
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,800
Oh, people are paying $100,000 for NFTs.

1065
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,000
Let's get in on that.

1066
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,680
Like that's that's that's all it is.

1067
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,960
So anyway, for now, let's move on for more stories.

1068
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:13,160
Loki about another gaming company face a boy if you think you think Intellivision has bad

1069
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,280
owners, try this next was bad.

1070
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,240
It's like, you know, on the board of a company.

1071
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,960
How about Mohammed Buzzsaw or Salman?

1072
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,440
You know, the guy that, you know, murdered people.

1073
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,480
Allegedly murdered.

1074
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,360
He murdered people.

1075
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,360
OK, he killed people, killed, you know, reporters and stuff like that.

1076
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,920
Well, he owns 96.18% of SNK now.

1077
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:47,640
So because he invested in them and so, yeah, so now now when you buy an SNK game, know

1078
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,280
that the money is going to a goddamn murderer.

1079
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,120
So how do we feel good about those King of Fighter games?

1080
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,800
How do we get that to stop?

1081
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,360
How do we take and I realize the answer is you don't.

1082
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,280
But I think a lot of people are feeling some type of way because, you know, we also have

1083
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,000
that news about Elon Musk buying, you know, his a stake of Twitter and buying a seat on

1084
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,960
the board, essentially.

1085
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,520
And look, I'm not trying to necessarily equate those two people, but the reality is it's

1086
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,520
on a lot of people's mind as well this week.

1087
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,920
And I think a lot of people are like, how can we stop that from happening?

1088
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,120
And most people are like, you can't.

1089
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:24,600
And it just seems weird, like that you can't stop him from coming in and taking over that

1090
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,720
much of the company where now it just feels like dirty.

1091
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,520
You know what I mean?

1092
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,800
Yeah, I just.

1093
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,880
But as nothing you can do, SSG 100.

1094
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,680
SSG 100.

1095
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:42,280
Matt wants to point out, you know, before everybody starts protesting and the whole

1096
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:47,880
basically lending itself to it is you really can't be an ethical consumer in a capitalist

1097
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,360
society is really what it is as to 100.

1098
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:55,800
Matt says he sadly owns a lot of minority shares of many companies, banks, airlines,

1099
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,300
etc.

1100
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,760
But who's going to hold him accountable?

1101
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,040
Nobody, nobody.

1102
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,120
And that's that's that's what gets very frustrating about this world sometimes.

1103
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,920
Anyway, let's try to move on to happier news and things that maybe, you know, we can we

1104
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,480
can we can wrap ourselves in a little blanket and feel better about these types of news

1105
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,480
for what they're worth.

1106
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,520
And that is return to Monkey Island.

1107
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,720
Yes, it's a thing that's absolutely want to return to Monkey Island.

1108
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,200
It's it's not just an April Fool's joke.

1109
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,640
And it's by Ron Gilbert.

1110
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:37,400
I Ron Gilbert is indeed working on a new entry called Return to Monkey Island.

1111
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,600
It's going to come out this year.

1112
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,840
There is a new trailer available on YouTube.

1113
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:47,800
It is a follow up to Monkey the Secret Monkey Island and Monkey Island to Le Chunk's Le

1114
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,480
Chunk Le Chuck's Revenge.

1115
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,720
Le Chunk was from the Goonies.

1116
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,220
Sorry.

1117
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,920
So I guess this is Monkey Island three in some ways.

1118
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,200
Terrible Toy Box is making this game.

1119
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,440
They made Thimbleweed Park for those that know that one, which was a great.

1120
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,400
Yeah, that was like a giveaway on Epic Game Store and stuff.

1121
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,200
Not that long ago.

1122
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:15,400
Also, Rex Crowl, who did design with games like Tearaway and Little Big Planet.

1123
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,360
That's a pretty good name.

1124
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,680
That's he's the art director.

1125
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,040
So that's going to be pretty exciting.

1126
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,240
It's good.

1127
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:21,480
Yeah.

1128
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,680
Otherwise, we don't know a whole lot more about it.

1129
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,360
That's pretty much all we know at this time.

1130
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,440
But this is this also has nothing to do with because Telltale did a Monkey Island game

1131
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,520
like they did a reboot of the first game a while ago.

1132
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:32,680
Right.

1133
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,880
But this is not this has nothing to do with any of that.

1134
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,680
So this is a new a new game from the Thimbleweed Park folks.

1135
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,000
They are collaborating with Lucasfilm Games, a Disney company.

1136
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,000
I don't think Lucasfilm actually has their own development studio at this point.

1137
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,680
No, it's like a holdings thing at this point.

1138
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,720
It's licensing.

1139
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,040
Yeah.

1140
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:54,440
Yeah.

1141
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,840
As 100 Matt points out, they're also getting the voice cast from the previous games.

1142
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,640
That's pretty cool.

1143
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:06,360
That's that is like literally like the 90s television reboot, like the X Files coming

1144
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,720
back for another season or Roseanne.

1145
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,960
But then Roseanne's a monster.

1146
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:17,400
So it's the Connors comes back for a new season and all these and all the game shows.

1147
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,120
Press Your Luck is back and all these game shows coming back.

1148
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,440
It's like the video game version of that.

1149
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,640
And they're getting the band all back together to do the voices.

1150
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,440
So that's pretty cool.

1151
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,920
We get another Maniac Mansion game because I'd like to see another Maniac Mansion game.

1152
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,880
It's all about the money.

1153
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,280
Bobby Black Wolf points out he's bringing in characters from the later Monkey Island

1154
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,640
games that he didn't do.

1155
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,640
So he's not honoring their story, but he's honoring the characters.

1156
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:50,120
That reminds me of the Blaster Master Zero franchise making that character from the FX

1157
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,600
Nine books canon to the series.

1158
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:59,400
Eve is canon to the series based on those books that hardly anybody read.

1159
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,440
But yeah, anyway.

1160
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,960
So yeah, it's still it's still it's exciting that it's coming back.

1161
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,840
So that'd be nice.

1162
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,040
All right.

1163
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,040
Maybe something exciting for the future up next.

1164
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:08,680
Dark Sakura?

1165
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,040
I swear every time I try to unmute, it mutes itself right back again.

1166
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:25,320
Um, so the director of Sonic 2, basically his name is Jeff Fowler.

1167
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:31,640
He's gone on record saying that he would love to do a Smash Brothers movie.

1168
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:37,320
The quote is nothing would make me happier than to throw all the characters into a battle

1169
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,880
royale, getting Mario and Sonic in the ring.

1170
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,520
I mean, everyone would be kind of dying for that, right?

1171
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,240
It's a classic.

1172
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:49,000
So and I mean, in that game, though, would touch so many different franchises that I

1173
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
think the licensing would be very difficult because it's not just Nintendo.

1174
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,160
We have Namco, we have Capcom, we have all kinds of of areas.

1175
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,320
I just don't know how something like that would work.

1176
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:05,240
Or they could go like early Smash Brothers and just throw Sonic in there.

1177
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:05,960
Yes.

1178
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,800
You know, that way they don't license too much.

1179
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,920
It's all Nintendo, really.

1180
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,040
Yeah, but still, I don't know.

1181
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,800
I don't know how they make this.

1182
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,800
The story works fine for a game.

1183
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,880
I don't know that it would work well for a movie.

1184
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,720
Bobby does point out Wreck-It Ralph did the multiple license thing pretty well.

1185
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:27,320
But it didn't showcase they were mostly background people.

1186
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:34,600
Yeah, everyone who was a main character was effectively someone new.

1187
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:41,000
I think this is one of those weird fan expectations that shouldn't exist in reality.

1188
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:46,520
It seems very disconnected from the reality of how movies get financed and all that stuff.

1189
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,880
Like, I'm just being honest.

1190
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:53,000
Sure, as a video gaming fan, the idea of a Super Smash Brothers movie and all those characters

1191
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,840
on screen is awesome.

1192
01:03:54,840 --> 01:04:00,120
But the reality is, A, I don't see where the plot comes from.

1193
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:09,240
B, I feel like getting all those characters together in one place is going to be too expensive

1194
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,240
for the type of movie that you're going to get.

1195
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,080
S200 Matt says Rob is ruining everyone's fanfic dreams.

1196
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:15,960
That's what I do here.

1197
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:17,960
It is what it is.

1198
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:24,120
Like, I think we should just all focus on right now, hoping that the Mario movie is

1199
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:30,520
going to be really good, despite whatever reservations I have about the voice actors.

1200
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,020
Yeah.

1201
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,240
And the Sonic movies have been well received, whether you like them or not.

1202
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,640
At the end of the day, they made money.

1203
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,080
That's what it's about.

1204
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,120
Detective Pikachu.

1205
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,160
It made money, right?

1206
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,840
They're going to make another one, if I remember right.

1207
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,120
So there you got that.

1208
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,800
If the Mario movie does well, you know, like, that's that's got to be the first step.

1209
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,440
These movies have to make quite a bit of money, and then maybe we'll cross that bridge.

1210
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:59,080
But I feel like if the Mario movie does well, it's going to lend itself to the Donkey

1211
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,960
Kong movie and Donkey Kong Country in that.

1212
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,080
And I, I just-

1213
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,320
Donkey Kong is supposed to be in that movie.

1214
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:10,280
I know, but there's all the rumors about they're setting it up for a spinoff intentionally.

1215
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:15,480
So I think Nintendo kind of has to, like, live that out for a little bit before it's

1216
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,920
going to be, okay, call Sega and let's get Sonic.

1217
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,840
Call, you know, Konami and let's get Snake and all this other stuff.

1218
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:29,080
I just, I feel like Nintendo, Nintendo is getting back into movies after a very long

1219
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:29,580
absence.

1220
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:35,260
But I think the success of Sonic, again, whether you like it or not, it made money.

1221
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:41,740
The success of Sonic is going to lend itself well to Mario, because I think you're going

1222
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:47,500
to have that audience of people that grew up with Mario taking their kids who also are

1223
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,620
growing up with Mario.

1224
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,100
And that's why that movie will do well.

1225
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,100
So we'll see.

1226
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:59,340
Esther shown her mat says people are writing in Ryan Reynolds Detective Pikachu fighting

1227
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:02,700
Chris Pratt Mario and Seth Rogen DK.

1228
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,340
Okay, what fanfic ever got made into a movie?

1229
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:09,580
Of course, as those words leave my leave my mouth now I'm going Oh fuck, there was 50

1230
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,460
shades of gray.

1231
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,460
That movie literally ruined everything.

1232
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,620
That movie literally ruined everything.

1233
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,340
So it's like, what fanfic became a movie?

1234
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,580
Oh, oh, that.

1235
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,080
Right.

1236
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:21,440
Right.

1237
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,300
Anyway, all right, moving on, Loki.

1238
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:28,700
All right.

1239
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:35,420
So, you know, we talked a little bit about some previous goes recon games with break

1240
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,420
point and their whole NFT thing.

1241
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,460
Well, break point wasn't all that great.

1242
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:47,020
And now Ubisoft is ending their updates for break point and its live service plans.

1243
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:52,700
Once again, you know, all these companies pushing for live service games, and then they

1244
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,020
just quit on them after a short period of time.

1245
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,220
Don't get too invested in them, especially with NFTs.

1246
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,300
Because now those entities are worth what nothing.

1247
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:03,820
It's like that.

1248
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:08,540
I mean, with that racing game that closed down this last week to had a bunch of stuff

1249
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:08,860
in it.

1250
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:12,380
And now it's, you know, granted that nice fucking trash.

1251
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:17,100
But like, it's, it's, you know, what, what's the point of it?

1252
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:21,340
Am I going to be able to use my NFT helmet in this next goes recon game they put out?

1253
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,140
No, probably not.

1254
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:25,740
Cool.

1255
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,300
Glad you really dived in the NFTs.

1256
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,300
So yeah, it's going to be was it I think.

1257
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:38,460
Yeah, the both says they're going to continue to maintain the service for both goes recon

1258
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,220
wild land and break point.

1259
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,300
But they're gonna not be updating it.

1260
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:51,500
So, oh, Bobby says there are five movies based on fanfics.

1261
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,060
Really?

1262
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:52,700
What are the other?

1263
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:57,180
Okay, well, there were three movies in the 50 shades of gray.

1264
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,140
So what are the other two?

1265
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:08,220
I'm curious what the other two are as soon as Matt says Ubisoft is trying to find new

1266
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:12,620
decimals to support NFTs, because they're already double, triple and quadruple down

1267
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:13,340
on NFTs.

1268
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,540
Mortal Instruments is a Harry Potter fanfic.

1269
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,020
Really?

1270
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:17,980
What's Mortal Instruments?

1271
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:18,700
I've never heard of it.

1272
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:24,060
That's the one with the the like cities that are on wheels that are like driving around

1273
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:24,940
and fighting each other.

1274
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:31,180
Pixel pocket says a one direction one and Bobby Blackwell says it's called after that

1275
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,660
a one direction fanfic got turned into a movie really?

1276
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,020
Here's the thing.

1277
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,820
There's any of my fanfics get turned into movies or books there.

1278
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:41,740
There's there's the right people, I guess.

1279
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,900
A fanfic and then there's okay, okay.

1280
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,980
Was Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter?

1281
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,020
Was that a fanfic?

1282
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,340
Technically, that's a fanfic.

1283
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,180
Because I feel like it was.

1284
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,980
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies really was.

1285
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:54,860
I guess that's true.

1286
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,300
I guess you guys are right.

1287
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:01,180
There's those what they're so fucking ludicrous that they kind of have to get made.

1288
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,540
So I guess there's that.

1289
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:03,500
That should be a movie.

1290
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,420
So fucking ludicrous starring ludicrous.

1291
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:10,060
And then it should have co-star Raven.

1292
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:11,660
Because she's so Raven.

1293
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:13,520
Yeah.

1294
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,220
All right, moving on.

1295
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,780
Let's talk about Pac-Land.

1296
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,060
This is ludicrous, too.

1297
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,660
I don't understand this.

1298
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:22,220
Well, I do.

1299
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,020
I completely do.

1300
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,700
But it's just it's weird.

1301
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,700
So arcade archives, right?

1302
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,740
There's like a lot of games.

1303
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,580
There's over 100 games in that series.

1304
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:34,780
That is a lot of the ports for of classic arcade games for PlayStation.

1305
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:39,020
And not Xbox for some reason, but Nintendo Switch as well.

1306
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:44,060
So Pac-Land recently came out on Arcade Archives.

1307
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,820
It came out on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

1308
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:50,780
Pac-Land, which, funny enough, we referenced on the show last week.

1309
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:55,420
We're not intending to be the official Pac-Land podcast, but sometimes it happens.

1310
01:09:55,420 --> 01:10:00,140
But I believe last week, Dark Sakura was talking about Mappy Land because it was just coming

1311
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,820
out on Nintendo Switch online.

1312
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:06,620
And it kind of led to a conversation about that weird era of Namco and their land games,

1313
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,980
which includes Pac-Land.

1314
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,860
So it's the side scrolling Pac-Man game.

1315
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:16,300
I'm going to say something that my co-host may not agree with, but it wasn't very good,

1316
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,220
in my opinion.

1317
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,020
It wasn't good.

1318
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:19,820
I played it.

1319
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,020
It was different.

1320
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:21,820
It was different.

1321
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,020
And that's what a lot of people remember.

1322
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:28,380
And it was, I think what a lot of people liked about it was that it looked very cartoony,

1323
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:32,860
and that was in that era where it was like, oh, it almost looks like a playable cartoon,

1324
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,940
like not like Dragon.

1325
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,620
I almost said Dragon Age, Dragon's Lair style playable cartoon.

1326
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:42,540
But you know, like the games of that era.

1327
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:43,820
Anyway, here's the thing.

1328
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:46,540
So Pac-Land did come out in 1984.

1329
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:52,700
And it also should be pointed out, it was based off the animated show from the 80s,

1330
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,340
the Hanna-Barbera Pac-Man show that was on for a little while.

1331
01:10:55,900 --> 01:11:01,740
And in the very beginning of the game, you basically see where Pac-Man is leaving home

1332
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:05,740
and waves goodbye to Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Baby or Baby Pac-Man.

1333
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,020
Well, guess what?

1334
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:13,740
Ms. Pac-Man is not in this Arcade Archives reboot.

1335
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:22,540
Now there is a character called Pac-Mom who has like a pink ponytail instead of the red

1336
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:27,660
bow, and Baby Pac-Man has been replaced with an unnamed character as well.

1337
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:32,060
Pac-Mom comes from Pac-Man Museum Plus.

1338
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:32,940
Here's the thing.

1339
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:40,380
There is apparently a little bit of legal drama going on behind the scenes because Bandai

1340
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:45,180
Namco still owns the Ms. Pac-Man property and can use Ms. Pac-Man wherever they want.

1341
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:51,980
But every time the depiction is used, a royalty is paid out to AT Games because they have

1342
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:55,980
a percentage of the royalty rights for Ms. Pac-Man every time she appears.

1343
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:02,700
So Bandai Namco, not really liking this deal, decided to change the character so they don't

1344
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,540
have to pay AT Games shit.

1345
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:11,980
And it's interesting because there is a Pac-Man Museum Plus that's on its way out and Ms.

1346
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:13,020
Pac-Man's not in it.

1347
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,900
Apparently Pac-Mom is in it though, somewhere in the museum.

1348
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,220
I don't know if it's the Pac-Lam thing or whatever.

1349
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:23,020
So this is just very interesting where the character's been essentially erased due to

1350
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:23,980
legal reasons.

1351
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,540
Although anybody looking at these screenshots...

1352
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,420
And let me see if I can post the link to this tweet on...

1353
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,260
Gosh darn.

1354
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:34,860
Let me see if I can get this Twitter link here.

1355
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:41,660
Sorry everyone for the bad audio there.

1356
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:42,460
Okay, I got the link.

1357
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,300
I'm going to paste this in our chat.

1358
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,740
And it's somebody's Twitter account.

1359
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:50,620
And for the podcast listeners, Nick is on line T, all one word.

1360
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:58,300
And they wrote a tweet on April 6th that shows the Pac-Mom and Ms. Pac-Man side by side.

1361
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:02,060
Pixel Paca's suggesting Pac-Mam as a possible name.

1362
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:03,900
Sure, whatever.

1363
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,460
But this is what they ended up calling her.

1364
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:08,380
Legally distinct Pac-Mom.

1365
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:15,500
Yeah, legally distinctly different Pac-Mom who had her bow replaced with a very Karen

1366
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,220
ponytail.

1367
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,860
Pat Karen is what she kind of looks like to me, to be honest.

1368
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:20,380
Karen doesn't have a ponytail.

1369
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,100
Karen has that weird wedge haircut.

1370
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:23,600
Yeah.

1371
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,980
So anyway.

1372
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:28,380
Let's see.

1373
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:33,340
Bobby Black Wolf says Ms. Pac-Man was the one that was made by that other company that

1374
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:36,140
modded Pac-Man arcade machines in the early 80s, right?

1375
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,540
I saw it on the Netflix high score documentary.

1376
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:42,460
Yeah, Ms. Pac-Man all started as a mod for the original Pac-Man machines because they

1377
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,380
weren't coming out with something fast enough for that.

1378
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:49,180
That's where I'm like pack plus or whatever was came out of that whole thing, too.

1379
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:50,620
So it's interesting.

1380
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:54,380
So but also this is why arcade went up machines.

1381
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:57,020
A lot of the newer ones, I think one of them has Ms.

1382
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,460
Pac-Man in it, but most of the collections don't have Ms.

1383
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:00,960
Pac-Man.

1384
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,500
I think one of the first does.

1385
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,740
But like now these Namco collections, they don't have Ms.

1386
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:06,240
Pac-Man.

1387
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:11,020
They'll they'll they fall back on Super Pac-Man, which I enjoyed.

1388
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,220
But a lot of people do not think it holds a candle to the original.

1389
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:14,860
It's different.

1390
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,580
Great.

1391
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:16,080
It's different.

1392
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,300
It's just a different challenge.

1393
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,580
Yeah, it's a different challenge.

1394
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,420
So anyway.

1395
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:23,180
All right.

1396
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:26,700
So that is that is interesting with Pac-Land.

1397
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:31,340
I still am interested in that museum plus thing that's coming out.

1398
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,620
I think that's kind of interesting.

1399
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:40,860
But yeah, anyway, let's get to discussion on another classic game in this.

1400
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:41,420
Segment.

1401
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:57,580
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1402
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,900
out a classic and tell you about it.

1403
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:02,540
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1404
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,980
And what did you pick for us this week, Dark Sakura?

1405
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,540
I picked Fatal Frame.

1406
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:12,940
Which I actually haven't played and I really should.

1407
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,060
Oh, really?

1408
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,900
In Japan, the game is known as Zero.

1409
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:24,700
And in Europe, it was called Project Zero.

1410
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:28,540
It's a survival horror game that was made by Tecmo for PS2.

1411
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:34,940
The game was released on December 13th, 2001.

1412
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,140
It was the first in the series.

1413
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:42,540
And in North America, it came out in 2002.

1414
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:47,020
There is an enhanced port on Xbox that came out in PlayStation 2 in North America and

1415
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,100
2003 in Japan and Europe.

1416
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:58,380
So as far as publishing, it was published by Tecmo in both Japan and North America.

1417
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:05,180
And in Europe, it was done by Wannadu and then for the Xbox versions by Microsoft.

1418
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:08,780
And then there was a re-release in North America for PlayStation Network in 2013.

1419
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:16,460
So it's set in 1986 and it follows these two siblings named Miku and Mahuyu Hinasaki.

1420
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:24,140
Mahuyu disappears looking for a novelist in the haunted mansion called Himuro Mansion.

1421
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:26,220
And so Miku goes to find him.

1422
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:34,700
And so through the course of the game, she acquires a camera referred to as the camera

1423
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:46,940
Obscura and uses her own sixth sense to locate ghosts and sometimes capture the most

1424
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,460
volatile of ghosts.

1425
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:55,580
And it has an interesting control mechanism because when you use the camera, it switches

1426
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:59,900
to first person and then you move it with your right analog stick and the character

1427
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,020
can move with the left stick.

1428
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,860
So it's sort of like this weird strafing thing.

1429
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:10,140
And the film is your ammo, which of course you find it all over the mansion and can replenish.

1430
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:18,940
So basically the siblings have this special ability to see supernatural events.

1431
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:29,820
And so when Mahuyu disappears looking for his tutor, who is Takamine Junsei, Miku goes

1432
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:34,380
to find him, like I said, and then she finds that Takamine's party was killed by the ghosts

1433
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:38,380
and finds rope burns appearing on her wrists and ankles.

1434
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:43,740
And it turns out that there was a ritual that happened with a particular miko or a shrine

1435
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:49,100
maiden torn apart using the ropes attached to her limbs in a strangling ritual.

1436
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,420
Yeah, it's pretty, pretty brutal.

1437
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:59,500
And so you learn more about the game by going through it.

1438
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:07,500
And according to the staff of the game, the first ending is canon and leads to the events

1439
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,860
in the third game.

1440
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:20,620
So the game, the concept of the game came to the director, Shibata Makoto, after they

1441
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:24,780
finished working on Tecmo's Deception Invitation to Darkness.

1442
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:31,420
He kind of got it in one of his own dreams and different encounters he thought were supernatural.

1443
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:38,540
And so when development started on PlayStation 2 hardware, when Tecmo got a hold of it,

1444
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:41,020
it went under the name Project Zero.

1445
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:47,900
He also had some influence by how positively the characters in Silent Hill were received.

1446
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:54,380
And wanted to go further and create the sense of seeing things that were off screen

1447
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:58,940
and to create a frightening atmosphere, one as scary as possible.

1448
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:05,740
And the key colors were black and white with white representing hope and black representing fear.

1449
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:09,580
And they put a lot of that into the clothing and the shading.

1450
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:19,100
And then the third color in it was the red that Miku wore and she represented life.

1451
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:27,500
And then they put a lot of effort into focusing on stereophonic sound to reinforce the atmosphere

1452
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:32,700
of the game to give it a more three-dimensional feeling as they were going along through it.

1453
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:40,380
They used different motifs of spirituality.

1454
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:46,380
They wanted to give a feeling of isolation through the lack of the modern technology,

1455
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:53,020
such as mobile phones and things like that.

1456
01:19:53,500 --> 01:20:04,780
So, I mean, I think that it's a very interesting concept.

1457
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:12,460
Famitsu really was happy with the use of the camera Obscura with the additional tension,

1458
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:15,180
including with the visual design.

1459
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:17,900
The game was pretty well received.

1460
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:23,580
And then, of course, there was a sequel Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Butterfly

1461
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,460
and then Fatal Frame 3 The Tormented.

1462
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:31,820
And then they announced a Hollywood adaptation in 2003.

1463
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:33,980
Oh, that's right.

1464
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:41,420
But it was under a long hiatus and then re-announced for 2014 with a production.

1465
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:48,460
It says set to begin production after the completion and released a Fatal Frame

1466
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:49,420
made in the Blackwater.

1467
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,300
Interesting.

1468
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,460
That'd be interesting if they ever really do make a movie out of this.

1469
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,420
Fatal Frame, classic game of the week.

1470
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:02,780
I'm reading some comments from chat here because Jason, our voiceover sir,

1471
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:05,020
has a lot to say here in chat about the series.

1472
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:09,820
And this definitely seems like one of those games where those that have played it have a lot of

1473
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:11,740
connection to it.

1474
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:13,260
I think it's a cult game in that way.

1475
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:17,980
Not like cult, like we're going to drink Kool-Aid or whatever.

1476
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,020
I'm talking like cult-like.

1477
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,540
It's just like one of those.

1478
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,780
If you played this, you know why it's cool.

1479
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:29,340
Jason says, Fatal Frame holds a special place in my heart, by which I mean a scarred portion

1480
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:29,900
of my brain.

1481
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:35,340
Fatal Frame was a catalyst for many years of utter fear and paranoia in my life from

1482
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:37,820
about 2002 to 2007.

1483
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:41,180
After playing through and beating one to three, I got a lot of closure.

1484
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:44,700
I didn't kick all my fear, but it came down from being a paranoia.

1485
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,900
It is a great game.

1486
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:50,540
One to three, make a great series, assuming you are not particularly susceptible to paranormal

1487
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:51,340
fears.

1488
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,580
I love the game immensely.

1489
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,940
And then, uh, yeah.

1490
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,780
Jason says it's a cult classic.

1491
01:21:56,780 --> 01:22:01,420
One may even call it an occult classic, but, um, all right.

1492
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:02,140
So there it is.

1493
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:05,980
Well, I mean, it, it got some really good scores.

1494
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:12,780
I mean, um, Famitsu gave it a 32 out of 40 for PS2, which is pretty good for Famitsu.

1495
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:17,500
There were places that were like in the sevens to eights.

1496
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,300
Eurogamer gave it a nine out of 10 for PS2.

1497
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:27,580
Um, I'd say it pretty, it got above average responses, but, um, the big thing that people

1498
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:32,540
liked in the Xbox ports were the improved textures and expanded features.

1499
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:44,140
Um, especially, um, that those improvements were, were more of something that smooths

1500
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:46,700
it over without making a substantial change to the game.

1501
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:48,860
All right.

1502
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:54,620
Well, Fatal Frame, your classic game of the week and a good choice.

1503
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:57,980
That's one, um, that's one I want to go back and revisit.

1504
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:00,460
In fact, I don't even know if I don't think I played that.

1505
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,940
I think I watched someone else play that game.

1506
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,460
I think that's how that went for me.

1507
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:07,340
It was, uh, I, uh, watched somebody else play it.

1508
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:08,620
So, uh, yeah.

1509
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,180
Anyway, there it is.

1510
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,100
All right.

1511
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:13,740
Moving on.

1512
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,100
Um, I don't know why, I'm sorry.

1513
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,940
I lost the video of my co-host.

1514
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:17,660
Sorry, folks.

1515
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,420
I don't know why that happened.

1516
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,420
Um, but I will try to get them back here.

1517
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:21,980
There we go.

1518
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:22,460
Much better.

1519
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:22,940
Sorry about that.

1520
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:28,780
The joys of recording live and trying to manage a video while managing audio.

1521
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:29,100
All right.

1522
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:33,500
I need, I now, now I'm convinced I need a third monitor.

1523
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:37,740
Like two, two isn't enough for me to do this show somewhere.

1524
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:38,300
Really?

1525
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,420
I might take you up on it.

1526
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:43,180
If you're, cause I could use, I could use a third up here just for B roll stuff.

1527
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:44,780
Like that would be fantastic.

1528
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:45,260
I'll see.

1529
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:48,220
But honestly enough, you should invest in a wide screen monitor.

1530
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:48,780
Like I've got.

1531
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,100
Yeah, those are pretty cool.

1532
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,500
Um, they're not too expensive either.

1533
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:53,820
Yeah.

1534
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,060
I love the idea though of like an output.

1535
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,860
That's just like, you, you see exactly what it's going to look like.

1536
01:23:58,860 --> 01:23:59,820
You're just capturing the screen.

1537
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,380
There's a part of me that just kind of like that, but you can kind of.

1538
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:05,020
I need to start using my iPad for my chat.

1539
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:05,740
Yeah.

1540
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:06,300
Yeah.

1541
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,100
Use the sidecar.

1542
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:08,380
Sidecar.

1543
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:09,420
All right.

1544
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,740
I think it's a fun name.

1545
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:12,620
No, it is a cute name.

1546
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,260
I do like it.

1547
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:13,980
All right.

1548
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:19,260
Let's travel around the world quickly, uh, with some other quick news stories and some

1549
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:20,700
rapid via news.

1550
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:21,340
So Loki.

1551
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:22,860
Yeah.

1552
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:29,420
So Criterion has given us an update on their new need for speed game, which they had originally

1553
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:31,580
announced back in 2020.

1554
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:39,340
Um, but that should be coming out this November on PlayStation five and the Xbox series X and S.

1555
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:42,620
I'm all about a new Criterion racing game.

1556
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:46,220
I wish it was burnout though, but need for speed.

1557
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:50,540
I guess we'll have to wait and see what that looks like, but I'd prefer it was burnout.

1558
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,820
Um, like you're crashing stuff.

1559
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:56,460
Yeah, it's just burnout.

1560
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,900
Like me for speed is a classic.

1561
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:05,100
Um, Square Enix says that they have no plans on a sequel for Chrono Cross.

1562
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:10,060
Uh, basically saying that, listen, uh, there are no plans for a sequel or a new title now,

1563
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,220
but who knows what the future holds.

1564
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:16,380
So that doesn't mean you won't get one for Chrono Trigger.

1565
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,820
Cross was the sequel to Chrono Trigger.

1566
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:24,940
No, I know it was, or, well, is it considered a sequel or is it considered, I thought it

1567
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:28,460
was just considered like, um, I don't know.

1568
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:31,500
Like it's got Luca and everyone in it.

1569
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:32,460
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1570
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,940
I was trying to think like, like how shock treatment is a sequel to Rocky Horror.

1571
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:39,020
Cause it has Brad and Janet, but it's not really a sequel.

1572
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:39,500
You know what I mean?

1573
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,020
Like it's one of those types of things.

1574
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:42,460
So I think so.

1575
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:42,960
Yeah.

1576
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,860
But what, what didn't they plan?

1577
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:46,620
Wasn't there another, wasn't there a chrono?

1578
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:52,940
There was a third chrono game that was planned at some point, but I forget what it was called.

1579
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:53,980
Um, but yeah, it'd be interesting.

1580
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:54,480
You never know.

1581
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:55,520
Anyway.

1582
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:57,420
Uh, let's move on to our soccer.

1583
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:01,820
Um, on the 12th, uh, sorry, I'm looking at the wrong thing.

1584
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:07,100
Um, so Mario golf is coming to switch online's expansion pack.

1585
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:11,580
And for people who care about playing Mario golf.

1586
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:12,080
Cool.

1587
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:14,700
Congrats to you.

1588
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,580
64 game.

1589
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,180
And then a 10 to 64 game.

1590
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,620
Oh, yep.

1591
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,220
Um, and then Metroid Dread has had an update.

1592
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:24,620
It is version 2.1.0.

1593
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,700
It adds, uh, some new modes.

1594
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:33,020
Including boss rush, where you fight, uh, 12 continuous boss battles and aim for the best time.

1595
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:35,740
Damage is carried over into the next fight.

1596
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:37,740
Although weapons are fully restored.

1597
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:43,580
If a Samus is defeated, you can retry to continue playing from the start of the battle that you lost,

1598
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,500
but there is a time penalty for being defeated.

1599
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:51,340
And then the bosses fought in the boss rush can be fought one on one anytime by selecting practice.

1600
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:55,340
There's also survival rush, where you see how many bosses you can defeat inside of a

1601
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,220
five minute limit.

1602
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:00,860
You have dread rush, which is like boss rush, but if you're hit by a boss,

1603
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:03,500
your energy drops to zero and you are defeated.

1604
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,260
So it's like be perfect.

1605
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:10,620
And then it fixed, um, an error where the game over screen would not display properly.

1606
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:14,620
When Samus takes damage and is defeated immediately after destroying a central unit.

1607
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,780
I need to go back and revisit Metroid Dread.

1608
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,940
I think it's one of those games where I just, the, the wrist problems I was having playing

1609
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,260
it left a really sour taste in my mouth.

1610
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:26,780
I need to go back and give it another shot.

1611
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,300
And I think it's the fault of the game though.

1612
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:33,180
It's not, but like the reality is I'm still gonna, you're still gonna, you get that Pavlov,

1613
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:36,060
Pavlov's bell response, you know, whether it's the game's fault or not,

1614
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:39,340
it's still one of those things where I just associate the risk pain of playing the game.

1615
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:43,900
So I'm hoping that maybe I'm going to go back and revisit it and maybe I'll just use different

1616
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,340
controller that won't, um, have that same effect probably.

1617
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:54,220
So speaking of controllers, um, we just got like the two of the SNES controllers

1618
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:56,060
and a Genesis controller for switch.

1619
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:56,560
Oh yeah.

1620
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:57,740
Yeah.

1621
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:01,820
Maybe something like that that is a little bit more, I don't know, old school.

1622
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:02,460
Yeah, maybe.

1623
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:04,940
Or I just, I just need to play maybe with the joy cons.

1624
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:05,340
I don't know.

1625
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,500
Or just maybe not be in the same posture.

1626
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,140
I was living in a different place back then and had a completely different setup.

1627
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,740
So maybe that's all I needed, you know?

1628
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:14,220
So, or not don't stream at this time.

1629
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,940
Cause that also changes my posture and probably not for the better.

1630
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:21,340
So pretty atrocious stream posture.

1631
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:21,840
Yeah.

1632
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:22,300
Yeah.

1633
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,860
And I've, I've found I've not been streaming as much and I don't know.

1634
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:25,660
I gotta be honest.

1635
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:26,540
I don't know what it is.

1636
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:27,500
I need to get back into it.

1637
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:32,380
I have project ideas stewing in my mind, but, um, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't mean

1638
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:33,740
shit until I put it on paper.

1639
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:39,900
So I also need to talk to you about something with another streamer slash podcaster for

1640
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:40,620
later.

1641
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:41,580
Yeah, I'd be interested.

1642
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:42,080
All right.

1643
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:45,980
Anyway, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and, and

1644
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:49,660
things that'll come sooner than any of those projects, because these are this week.

1645
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:51,900
So let's talk about release dates in the U S Loki.

1646
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:54,540
And let's remember it is April.

1647
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:56,220
So don't expect much.

1648
01:28:56,220 --> 01:29:05,180
Uh, we've got, we've got, uh, 13 sentinels, uh, GS rim on Nintendo switch.

1649
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:12,140
Uh, nobody saves the world on an intense switch PlayStation four and PlayStation five and

1650
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:14,700
tormented souls on Nintendo switch.

1651
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:20,220
That's it going to the Nintendo switch in Japan and checking out the releases this week.

1652
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:22,380
Uh, very similar to what Loki was saying.

1653
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:26,460
Cause that 13 sentinels ages rim is also out in Japan this week on the 12th.

1654
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:31,180
And then on the 14th, you have battle spirits, connected battles, skull, the hero slayer

1655
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:35,900
in a regular and deluxe edition, uh, and the Smurfs mission belief.

1656
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,220
That is an actual game that's coming out.

1657
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:42,780
I have no, is, does it, is there a movie or something that I'm unaware of?

1658
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,300
No, it looks like it's based on the cartoon.

1659
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:45,020
Interesting.

1660
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:49,900
I'm sure that was released here and can't imagine it wasn't on my radar, but it wasn't

1661
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,580
now here's the game.

1662
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:53,100
That's important.

1663
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:57,420
That's out on the switch this week, winning post nine 2022.

1664
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:57,900
That's right.

1665
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,140
Horse racing back on the switch this week.

1666
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:05,500
And this is a lovely idea of a, uh, a concept of a game that probably isn't coming out here.

1667
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,180
I think some of those winning post games maybe have seen the light of day over here,

1668
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:12,140
but this one won't very few, very few.

1669
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:13,260
This one won't.

1670
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:17,820
So, uh, anyway, for you horse racing fans, and I know you're out there winning posts,

1671
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:22,300
nine, the official from Koei Tecmo is out this week on the switch now quickly.

1672
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,660
Let's look at the PlayStation five.

1673
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:29,980
I can't believe it, but, uh, winning post is not a PlayStation five game.

1674
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:33,980
It's not pushing the graphical, uh, what can be done.

1675
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:40,300
So, uh, but we do have grand theft auto five gets a Japanese release this week on the PlayStation

1676
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:41,180
five in Japan.

1677
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:42,380
So that's neat.

1678
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:46,780
Um, and that's it for the record.

1679
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:51,180
I did look it up and there was a game called chrono break.

1680
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:52,060
That was trademark.

1681
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:52,860
That was it.

1682
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:53,900
That was a chrono break.

1683
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,020
And it never got green lit.

1684
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:02,780
Um, and it's still sort of floating around there as a maybe, but the quote was that there

1685
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:05,420
were a lot of politics involved in creating a new game.

1686
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:06,460
That's where you're wrong.

1687
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,060
They are on a chrono break.

1688
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:09,340
So trademark.

1689
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:09,840
Shut up.

1690
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:15,740
And with my, with my luck, it'll be a mobile phone game at this point.

1691
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:17,260
And I just, I get it.

1692
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:21,180
Did you know that there, there was kingdom heart games announced for mobile phone and

1693
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:23,100
you'll notice we didn't talk about them.

1694
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,740
You know why we're not going to play them moving on.

1695
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:28,300
Anyway.

1696
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:29,020
Anyway.

1697
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,540
Oh, I just, I'm sorry.

1698
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,820
It's quickly, quickly in Japan.

1699
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:32,620
I did need to say.

1700
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:37,020
Winning post nine is out on the PlayStation four.

1701
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,140
Just not the PlayStation five.

1702
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,300
Very important footnote.

1703
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:42,220
You may proceed with the UK.

1704
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:44,060
All right.

1705
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:48,300
So on the 12th, we have grand theft auto five for PlayStation and Xbox.

1706
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:52,380
Epic chef for those and the switch on the 12th.

1707
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:58,620
Also 13 sentinels Aegis rim on the switch for the 14th tormented souls for switch.

1708
01:31:59,180 --> 01:31:59,900
And that's it.

1709
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:04,380
If Epic chef, isn't Gordon Ramsey, cussing me out.

1710
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:07,180
Then it's not, it's not an Epic chef.

1711
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:08,380
That's an angry chef.

1712
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:11,500
He's just passionate.

1713
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:14,460
But they only nice to the kids.

1714
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:18,860
Yeah, I was going to say, but then when you watch the master chef kids, he's like the

1715
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:21,900
nicest fucking person, which you, you know, it's all an act.

1716
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,660
All that stuff on hell's kitchen is an act.

1717
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:25,100
I'm sure he's a nice guy.

1718
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:30,300
My, my favorite scene though, is with the lady that won the, the blind lady that won

1719
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:38,940
and him demonstrating how good her pie turned out and using the sound of it and the texture.

1720
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:43,020
Can you hear that your pie is done?

1721
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:47,980
It's in, and she was all crying and happy, but that's like, still like my favorite moment

1722
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:52,860
of how he is as a passionate cook and encouraging people to be their best.

1723
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:55,980
Yeah, I think he, I think he's a nice guy deep down, but let's be real.

1724
01:32:56,620 --> 01:33:01,900
A lot of us watch for his persona on kitchen nightmares, which is very different.

1725
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:02,620
He just doesn't take shit.

1726
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:04,940
Exactly.

1727
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:05,900
I like Gordon Ramsey.

1728
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:09,900
I think he's a, he's a little saturated at this point.

1729
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:12,220
Like how many shows is that man on seriously?

1730
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:17,500
But then honestly, again, I went to the hell's kitchen restaurant in Vegas, not this recent

1731
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:22,380
time, but when I was there a few years ago, pre pandemic, and I will say that was one

1732
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:23,820
of the fucking best meals I've ever had.

1733
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:25,020
So, you know what?

1734
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:28,380
He fucking walks the walk as far as I'm concerned.

1735
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,820
So have at it.

1736
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:33,180
I still would rather go to a Morimoto restaurant first.

1737
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:34,140
Yeah.

1738
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,500
DJ Rama S points this out.

1739
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:41,900
Rob, there was an episode where chef Ramsey yelled at someone, that person had an anxiety

1740
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:42,540
attack.

1741
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:46,060
He took the person aside and spoke to him and calmed him down.

1742
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:48,940
Like that's like, yeah, that sounds very Gordon Ramsey.

1743
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,620
Again, that's how you know it's an act.

1744
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:53,580
Like Gordon Ramsey should probably win an Oscar.

1745
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:58,700
I mean, I know Oscars aren't for TV shows, especially reality shows, but daytime, the

1746
01:33:58,700 --> 01:33:59,420
daytime is yes.

1747
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:02,940
Gordon Ramsey should probably win a daytime Emmy for a lot of his performance.

1748
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:03,740
Let's be real.

1749
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:04,860
He should win an Emmy.

1750
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:11,820
I know, um, the Emmy cannot get the amazing race and survivor or no it's drag race.

1751
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:17,900
Now like Ru Paul has won that Emmy for like seven years and this may shock you.

1752
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:21,420
I think it's time to stop giving Ru Paul the Emmy for that show.

1753
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,180
Like it's, it's time.

1754
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:25,180
It's time for Ru Paul to stop.

1755
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:29,340
It's, it's time for that show to, to, you know, I, I like the talent.

1756
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,180
If you're going to do anything, bring back Drag U.

1757
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:31,580
Yeah.

1758
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:34,380
But anyway, it's time to give the Emmy to Gordon Ramsey.

1759
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:37,180
Lady Bunny has a wig to support.

1760
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:37,680
Okay.

1761
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:39,840
All right.

1762
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:41,100
Moving on.

1763
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,940
Um, let's see.

1764
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:43,980
Oh, more now.

1765
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:44,780
Here's the thing.

1766
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:46,860
Well, we, here's the thing.

1767
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:48,620
It's the show about video games.

1768
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:52,380
But when I talk about video games, when Loki talks about Dark Star talks about videos,

1769
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:55,740
we don't, we don't have nearly the chat lighting up this much.

1770
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:58,940
We talk about Gordon Ramsey and now y'all got something to say.

1771
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:01,900
It's just interesting.

1772
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:03,020
I guess we just have to do that.

1773
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:04,300
I guess so.

1774
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:04,780
I know.

1775
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,700
Yeah, we've, we've way overdue on that.

1776
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:07,200
Sorry guys.

1777
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:13,340
Jason says there was a shot of Ramsey and someone else at a Vegas Golden Knights, the hockey team.

1778
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:16,780
See, if you're in, if you're anywhere near San Jose, you don't acknowledge the Golden

1779
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:17,100
Knights.

1780
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:17,500
That's the thing.

1781
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,140
All right.

1782
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:22,540
His smile was unlike any I've ever seen on him, on his shows.

1783
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:25,260
Each Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, UK and US.

1784
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:28,780
He's, he's because he's playing that guy on TV.

1785
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:35,420
Phoenix 7726 says it's time for that show to sashay away.

1786
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:36,140
Absolutely.

1787
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:40,700
Phoenix says Gordon is huge on Twitch for some reason.

1788
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:45,260
I, I have seen, I don't know how many Dead by Daylight streamers who will watch clips

1789
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:48,220
of Kitchen Nightmares while they're waiting 30 minutes for their match.

1790
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:51,100
So it's just a weird thing.

1791
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:51,900
All right.

1792
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,060
Anyway, moving on.

1793
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:54,300
Yes.

1794
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,140
And regarding OLR foodie.

1795
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:57,580
We all know why it was delayed.

1796
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:00,140
I'm ready to do the show again.

1797
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:02,300
Like a lot has changed since October.

1798
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:02,800
Okay.

1799
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:04,460
But now the problem.

1800
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:08,300
There's been lots of stuff going on.

1801
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,220
Not with, with I think all of us, so.

1802
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:11,260
Oh, for sure.

1803
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:16,460
But, um, uh, I was going to say the only problem now is that we're not going to have dark soccer

1804
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,700
next week and we're not going to have Loki in two weeks.

1805
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,660
So at this point, I can't promise foodie Oh, until may.

1806
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:23,020
And that's just a scheduling thing.

1807
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:25,580
Cause everybody's got other stuff going on, which is legit.

1808
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:29,340
Everybody's allowed to have a vacay every now and then I just went to Las Vegas.

1809
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,420
I just happened to not be there on an OLR night.

1810
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:33,020
I wish mine were big.

1811
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:37,820
Well, if you want to tell them, tell them, but otherwise we're just going to gloss over

1812
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:38,780
it like I've been doing.

1813
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:39,660
All right.

1814
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:41,260
Remember that stone?

1815
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:43,420
It didn't go anywhere.

1816
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:43,820
All right.

1817
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:49,660
I, I, I got to, I got to send them the troops, you know, physically remove it.

1818
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:50,780
You said it, not me.

1819
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:52,220
So, um, there you go.

1820
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:55,900
That's the mystery, mystery, mystery solved.

1821
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:59,820
Your yours wasn't as little and cute invasive as that though.

1822
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:01,820
No, I was awake.

1823
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:03,900
So, all right.

1824
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:08,620
Well, obviously Loki, we're all thinking of you through that, um, crappy scenario there.

1825
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:09,820
Wishing you the best.

1826
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:15,420
I mean, you seem in good spirits, all things, you will be fine, but it's, it's, it's, it's

1827
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:18,220
like when my gallbladder came out, I knew I was going to be fine.

1828
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,060
It's just fucking annoying.

1829
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:21,900
The whole process is annoying.

1830
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:24,540
Being out of commission for two weeks is annoying.

1831
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:25,500
All of it is annoying.

1832
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:31,980
All of my, all of my laparoscopies, like my last two surgeries that I had other than my

1833
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,820
knee, I was happy.

1834
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,540
I was happy to be out of commission.

1835
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:38,220
I'm like, I'm on my couch.

1836
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:39,900
No one's bothering me.

1837
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:41,420
This is great.

1838
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:44,060
All right.

1839
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:45,020
Uh, let's move on.

1840
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:48,060
We still have some shifts, some non Gordon Ramsey topics to get to.

1841
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,180
Let's get to that.

1842
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:51,020
Well, maybe Gordon Ramsey could show up in this.

1843
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:51,500
I don't know.

1844
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,660
Loki, uh, what do you think about this next story?

1845
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:56,940
I mean, they have everything, so why not?

1846
01:37:56,940 --> 01:38:04,700
Um, so Epic games has, uh, partnered with, uh, Lego on a new project that they say, well,

1847
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:09,660
and they drop metaverse into their pitch or whatever.

1848
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:16,940
Um, so to me, it sounds like, you know, Roblox, but just licensable.

1849
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:22,380
So, you know, whereas Roblox made something that looked very similar to Lego, but not

1850
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:31,100
quite what this is basically Lego, but you know, Lego, um, neat be cool to see what they

1851
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:31,660
come up with.

1852
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:32,460
I love Lego.

1853
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:39,820
So, you know, and after all, as I pointed out to Rob on Twitter, they have, uh, the

1854
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:41,580
little, what do they call those?

1855
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:49,820
Um, uh, gosh, um, the minifigures, it's not minifigs, but they're like the, uh, the brick

1856
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:50,300
heads.

1857
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,060
So they have the brick heads for the spice girls.

1858
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:55,660
Now I saw that because they had the Muppets too is a thing.

1859
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:56,220
Oh, they do.

1860
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:59,340
Yeah, at least I'm pretty sure I saw that on like Twitter or something.

1861
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:05,340
So yeah, I definitely want those spice girls went, but I'm like, Lego is that addiction.

1862
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:10,300
I've been somehow able to stave off this whole time, even through the Mario's and all that.

1863
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:16,380
It's, and it's one of those things I'm like, they have that, the Nintendo 64, uh, was it

1864
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:20,700
Mario 64, uh, the question block base.

1865
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:24,540
They have that a target and I keep, I keep passing by it every time because it's like

1866
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:25,660
$170.

1867
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:27,660
I'm like, yeah, block really.

1868
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:30,460
Some somebody question block.

1869
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:32,460
It's like, you know, that, that big or whatever.

1870
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:37,180
And then it folds out into a bunch of the different, like it's a micro scale world of

1871
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:39,100
like the different levels and stuff.

1872
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:44,220
Well, somebody actually have a Lego Fiat kit that I haven't put together yet.

1873
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:50,940
Somebody just brought into this house, um, some shelves, which was very kind and nice.

1874
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:54,380
And it's perfect for showing off Legos to be quite honest.

1875
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,780
If no, it's, it's made for cats.

1876
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:57,180
Yeah.

1877
01:39:57,180 --> 01:40:00,700
If I wasn't worried about the cats, I'm not worried about smoosh as much.

1878
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:03,740
Cause he's kind of too stupid to get past the first level.

1879
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:08,700
But cheddar, I'm noticing like just in the short time we've had cheddar, I'm absolutely

1880
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:14,060
noticing he will find the highest point in the room to climb up to and look down upon

1881
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:14,940
the rest of you.

1882
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:16,460
That is absolutely cheddars mo.

1883
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:17,500
He's that kind of cat.

1884
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:20,780
So the minute that shelving came in, I was like, Oh God cheddar.

1885
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:22,540
I'm not going to be able to put anything on these shelves.

1886
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:25,660
Cause cheddar is going to run up to the top immediately.

1887
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:29,660
I will be able to put things on the shelves when I met him on the top of your closet.

1888
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:33,020
I'll just have to get little, um, like cover.

1889
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,740
I know Ikea has like coverings that can go over them so that he can't like actually knock

1890
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,620
things over in them.

1891
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:40,220
So like clear doors, basically.

1892
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:47,100
You can also like, if you were going to put like things on display, like, I don't know

1893
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:51,100
why trophies are coming to my mind, but just, you know, using that as an example or like

1894
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:56,220
figures or things you can, um, get Velcro for the bottom of them.

1895
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:56,780
Hmm.

1896
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:57,500
That's a good idea.

1897
01:40:58,140 --> 01:40:59,100
I want a trophy.

1898
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:01,340
I haven't had a trophy in a long time.

1899
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:07,180
For all the podcasts award right in front of me, but the Midna doesn't get up there

1900
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:10,620
for all the, she doesn't get anywhere that there's not food for all the jokes people

1901
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:13,180
make about participation trophies and then to stay in age.

1902
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:13,980
Where's my trophy?

1903
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:14,940
I don't have a trophy.

1904
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:15,100
Yeah.

1905
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:19,180
We have a podcast award, but dark soccer, you've, you've, you've taken custody of that

1906
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:20,060
and that's fine.

1907
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,580
You were the one that went down.

1908
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:23,100
I was like, you went down and got in person.

1909
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:23,740
It's only fair.

1910
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:24,620
I get it.

1911
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:27,020
Um, but do they still do those?

1912
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:30,220
Uh, they do, but it's changed a lot over the years.

1913
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:34,540
We kind of corporate, no, it's just at some point you had to pay to be in them and I'm

1914
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:35,900
just not interested in that.

1915
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:36,540
Yeah.

1916
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:41,900
So, um, most award shows are like these days anyways that you have to like pay for the

1917
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:42,940
privilege or whatever.

1918
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:43,900
Yeah.

1919
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:46,540
I'm just, it's, that's not the kind of thing that interests me.

1920
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:49,900
I just, I would, I love people being here live on Sunday.

1921
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:52,700
And listening to the podcast throughout the week.

1922
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:54,540
I don't, I don't need no word for that.

1923
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:55,900
It was nice to win that award.

1924
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,540
It was more than nice.

1925
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:57,500
It was lovely.

1926
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,660
Um, especially because it was the first year.

1927
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:00,300
It was nice.

1928
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:00,940
It was a surprise.

1929
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:01,180
Yeah.

1930
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:01,820
It kind of was.

1931
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:04,620
Um, and uh, yeah, yeah.

1932
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:05,980
Bonsovo six is wait, we got a trophy.

1933
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:06,060
Yeah.

1934
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:06,780
We won the pot.

1935
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:12,300
We won the very first podcast award in 2005 for best gaming podcast.

1936
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:19,180
So believe, believe it or not, uh, this, this, this was the best one.

1937
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:20,780
At that time.

1938
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:26,940
So anyway, uh, let's move on.

1939
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,580
Uh, let's talk about this story, dark soccer.

1940
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:34,300
So, um, y'all remember missed, right?

1941
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:38,140
You know, pointy, clicky adventure, pretty place.

1942
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:40,620
Um, yeah, now it's a mini golf game.

1943
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:49,100
So there, uh, so it's going to be a DLC pack for a VR.

1944
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,420
Golf game called walkabout mini golf.

1945
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:58,700
Um, and it will be available on meta quest and steam VR developed by, uh, mighty coconut.

1946
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:04,860
So you too can shoot balls around in the world of mist.

1947
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:08,300
They also have a course based on labyrinth,

1948
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:13,100
which would give me some minor incentive to actually play that except VR.

1949
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:17,660
Yeah, I check out the golf thing for sure.

1950
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:18,460
That sounds fun.

1951
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:19,980
All right.

1952
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:23,820
Uh, well, whereas I would be interested in playing that, let's be real.

1953
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:26,220
I'm never going to be interested in playing this next game, but we're gonna talk about

1954
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:26,700
it anyway.

1955
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:29,900
Cause it's fun to dunk on this company.

1956
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:30,380
Loki.

1957
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:33,740
Yes.

1958
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:34,620
Yes.

1959
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:36,300
So we've gotten to that point.

1960
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:39,020
I guess it's, it's, you know, in the stage of stages.

1961
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:41,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1962
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:42,300
We've been in that point.

1963
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:46,380
We've bought a house in that point where we're sending our mail from that point.

1964
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:51,260
And it's being, uh, uh, self-addressed stamped with you are here at the point.

1965
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:53,740
Yeah.

1966
01:43:53,740 --> 01:44:00,940
So, uh, Konami, uh, recently made a comment, uh, regarding their updates to E football.

1967
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:01,180
Yes.

1968
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:03,420
Remember that's still a game barely.

1969
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:09,660
Um, basically saying that we've entered what would be eventually a two year period of developing

1970
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,740
for E football 2022.

1971
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:16,460
However, we were too focused on getting the game out on time that we lost sight of the

1972
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:19,340
most important thing quality.

1973
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:26,460
Naturally, we were met with critical reviews from rightfully disappointing fans.

1974
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:32,780
And there's no, like, I don't see any assertion that we won't do this again.

1975
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:39,340
No, you know, since we're talking about searching that they won't do that.

1976
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:40,780
Since we're talking about trophies.

1977
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:44,460
Why don't we get a, you try.

1978
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:45,100
Why no, no.

1979
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:49,500
Why don't we make Konami a trophy that says literally the dumbest thing that's ever happened

1980
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:53,660
in gaming and send it to their office and see what happens.

1981
01:44:56,620 --> 01:45:00,460
Like, is it to have like worst decision making ever?

1982
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:01,660
Is it, is it petty?

1983
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:02,940
Yes.

1984
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:04,300
Am I above that?

1985
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:05,180
No, no.

1986
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:09,820
When it comes to Konami, are we, are we at that point?

1987
01:45:09,820 --> 01:45:10,220
Yes.

1988
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:12,540
I've already, I've already explained this to everybody.

1989
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:18,220
We're at that point where Konami is that just the, the board that is running Konami.

1990
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:21,500
It could, it could not be run by worse people.

1991
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:26,380
Like if Elon Musk bought Konami, I'd actually be like, you know what?

1992
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:27,420
Maybe they'll be okay.

1993
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:31,420
Like, I, I don't see.

1994
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:35,020
Well, maybe the other guy that Loki talked about would actually somehow be worse for

1995
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:35,420
Konami.

1996
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:38,940
So I'm not going to joke about that, but Elon Musk, I will joke about.

1997
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:42,620
And most people getting in and stepping about Konami, I will joke about.

1998
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:45,420
And that would probably be better for that company at the end of the day.

1999
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:53,020
S2100 Matt says there should be a segment called this week and Konami dunking on itself.

2000
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:53,740
Yeah, pretty much.

2001
01:45:54,620 --> 01:46:00,540
Questbuster says, if anyone had doubts, whether Konami was past caring, eFootball is there

2002
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:04,060
to remind them that yes, we are not the company you remember in your childhood.

2003
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:05,260
That is correct.

2004
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:06,300
That is correct.

2005
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:12,540
At this point, the best we can hope for is that when Sony said, hi, we're going to give

2006
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:17,340
you money for nothing to put games on service, Konami signed off on that.

2007
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:23,260
And we will have sweet code and one, two, three, four, and five all on this PlayStation

2008
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,500
plus thing.

2009
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:31,740
Cause I'm telling you right now, if one of those games is missing, that is exactly where

2010
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:37,260
the Kotaku Ardo will be out in five minutes about how that game is missing from PlayStation

2011
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:43,340
plus, sweet code and four, not on PlayStation plus PlayStation plus major oversights does

2012
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:44,540
not have sweet code and five.

2013
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:54,380
I'm telling you right now, if Sony does not have those games on the service, don't bother.

2014
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:56,780
Don't bother.

2015
01:46:58,540 --> 01:47:01,500
Anyway, let's see.

2016
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,300
What else do we have?

2017
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:07,020
Oh yes, actually this is, this is somewhat big news for the last story, but I think it's

2018
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:11,900
one of those things where we, we as gaming consumers don't really see the result of this

2019
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:19,180
for some time, but the unreal five engine has been officially released.

2020
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:24,780
It has been an early access for a year, but this last week, Epic games officially released

2021
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:26,540
UE5 to developers.

2022
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:32,940
Of course, some may remember the matrix awakens tech demo to show a little bit of what UE5

2023
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:33,900
can actually do.

2024
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:39,980
Which, you know, it looked really good and I think we're kind of excited to see what

2025
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:40,540
it can produce.

2026
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:48,060
But you know, the actual games that come from this probably won't be out for a little while

2027
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:51,020
because studios have only really had a year to play with it.

2028
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:56,300
For instance, black myth, wukong, which was one of the first announced unreal engine five

2029
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:56,860
games.

2030
01:47:56,860 --> 01:47:58,620
That's not out until 2023.

2031
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:03,260
The next Witcher game, ha keep on waiting.

2032
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:06,780
We do know though, a new Tomb Raider game.

2033
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:08,940
I mean, of course they're going to make a new Tomb Raider game.

2034
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,140
Why wouldn't they make a new Tomb Raider game?

2035
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:13,740
It'd be ridiculous if they didn't make a new Tomb Raider game, but we know that the next

2036
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:17,420
Tomb Raider game is going to be on unreal engine five because it was actually announced

2037
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:23,660
on the official Tomb Raider account in a tweet that said crystal dynamics is incredibly excited

2038
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:27,500
about the future of unreal and how it will help us take our storytelling to the next

2039
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:28,060
level.

2040
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:32,220
That's why we're proud to announce that our next Tomb Raider game is being built on unreal

2041
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:32,860
engine five.

2042
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:34,780
Hey, you know what?

2043
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:40,460
I'm ready to see it because the Tomb Raider reboots from God, that series probably started

2044
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:41,740
almost 10 years ago at this point.

2045
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:42,860
What was the Tomb Raider reboot?

2046
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:44,220
That was like 2013, wasn't it?

2047
01:48:44,860 --> 01:48:49,900
So the Lara Croft and the no good, terrible, terrible, very bad day.

2048
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,340
Yeah, that whole trilogy.

2049
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:56,380
You know, I mean, those already looked really good for its time.

2050
01:48:56,380 --> 01:49:00,540
Imagining that in unreal engine five, I think those games are going to be fire.

2051
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:07,500
Now, I know the Avengers, a lot of people believe was a misstep for crystal dynamics.

2052
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:13,420
I have a feeling there's a little bit of too many cooks in the kitchen going on with that.

2053
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:19,020
And, you know, hopefully with the next Tomb Raider, people kind of back off and let crystal

2054
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:20,460
dynamics do the game they want to do.

2055
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:23,020
And hopefully that'll be nice.

2056
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:31,260
So rep cycled is in our chat over twitch.tv slash fog network saying UE five engine looking

2057
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:32,220
shiny so far.

2058
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:33,740
Height.

2059
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:35,740
Yeah, I'm excited to see what comes out of this.

2060
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:41,820
Loki, you didn't make a game in unreal engine, though, but you've messed around with it,

2061
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:42,380
right?

2062
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:43,260
I have.

2063
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:46,540
Yeah, I have time to car with before you canceled.

2064
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:48,460
It was in that was unity.

2065
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:49,660
No, that was unity.

2066
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:57,020
I did I did a mop type game in unreal to try to learn it.

2067
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:05,740
And I for me, it was that because I don't really know C++ or I haven't worked in C++

2068
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:05,980
too much.

2069
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:10,940
So I tried using their blueprints and blueprints are all right, but it's very cumbersome to

2070
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:14,460
do things, but I got it to work and it was all right.

2071
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:15,980
It was just kind of learning it.

2072
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:18,620
Yeah, so yeah.

2073
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:19,120
All right.

2074
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:22,940
Well, that's all the slated stories we have for tonight.

2075
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:26,140
We'll check in in a year and see what games come out for unreal.

2076
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:26,380
Yeah.

2077
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:29,660
Well, I actually wanted to bring it.

2078
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:33,020
It's not really an unreal five, but it is unreal.

2079
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:34,300
You know, four point two five.

2080
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:34,540
Sure.

2081
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:40,620
Did you see the PTB with the Haddonfield rework for Dead by Daylight?

2082
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:43,340
No, I've seen the screen.

2083
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:46,300
The still screenshots, but I haven't seen people playing on the map.

2084
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:51,100
I saw I was watching LC play it the other day.

2085
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:53,260
It's really good.

2086
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:53,980
It looks nice.

2087
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:57,580
And the Legion music is really good.

2088
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:03,180
Like to explain to people who don't play, all of the killers have like their own chase

2089
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:05,260
music, but Legion is actually four people.

2090
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:08,780
And so each of them have their own chase music.

2091
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:14,300
If you play, they have like a standard chase music, but each of them has an add on that's

2092
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:15,420
like their own mix tape.

2093
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:17,900
And when you do that, it changes up the music.

2094
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:22,780
And then if you do two of their mix tapes as your add ons, then it really changes the

2095
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:23,100
music.

2096
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:24,940
It's called like the frantic mix tape.

2097
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:27,900
And it's pretty darn good.

2098
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:31,740
I have to say it was a very clever idea and something worth noting.

2099
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:35,260
Yeah, I know they're reworking that killer and they're reworking Ghostface.

2100
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:39,020
Not from the screen movies seemed really cool.

2101
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:42,140
A lot of people who weren't Legion fans said that they were suddenly really fun.

2102
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:42,380
Yeah.

2103
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:47,660
And then the Haddonfield map, because the very first, you know, Dead by Daylight is

2104
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:50,060
kind of known at this point as like the multiverse of horror.

2105
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:50,780
Right.

2106
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:58,060
But the very first license that game got that started the dam break was Halloween, Michael

2107
01:51:58,060 --> 01:51:59,740
Myers and Laurie Strode.

2108
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:03,260
So that Haddonfield map is as old as the game, pretty much.

2109
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:05,740
Yeah, that was the first licensed level.

2110
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:06,220
Yeah.

2111
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:06,700
Yeah.

2112
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:07,100
Yeah.

2113
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:11,420
So they're totally redoing it now because that, you know, over the years, it just with

2114
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:14,860
all the new perks, the new talents, the new things that new characters get, that map

2115
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:17,180
starts to show its problems on how the new talent.

2116
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:19,260
So they're completely redo because they got rid of the basement.

2117
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:20,540
Didn't they in that map?

2118
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:22,940
Not not the basement basement, but like the fake basement.

2119
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:24,700
No.

2120
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:25,740
Oh, I heard they got rid of it.

2121
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:26,780
The basement still there.

2122
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:27,340
Oh, okay.

2123
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:27,740
Interesting.

2124
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:28,700
Oh, I'm curious.

2125
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,580
From what I remember.

2126
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:33,340
But also, the houses have furniture.

2127
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:35,020
Yeah, it looks nice.

2128
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:35,740
It was really nice.

2129
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:41,180
Before though, the thing that made that map kind of cool is that all of the like

2130
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:44,060
artwork on the walls were actually concept drawings.

2131
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:46,160
So.

2132
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:53,580
I found out another thing that the entirety of the Hawkins Laboratory is still in the game files.

2133
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:57,580
I still think they should try to repurpose it somehow,

2134
01:52:57,580 --> 01:53:01,020
but maybe just legally, it's probably impossible at this point.

2135
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:05,820
I think they should make it the recording studio for the all kill chapter, but.

2136
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:06,320
Yeah.

2137
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:09,660
Didn't mean to derail, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

2138
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:10,300
No, it's fine.

2139
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:15,420
Well, usually we get to derail because when I go to the mailbag and it's empty, we derail,

2140
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:18,460
which I believe our mailbag is empty this week, but I could be wrong.

2141
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:18,780
It is.

2142
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:20,300
So I was proactively derailing.

2143
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:21,500
All right, that's fine.

2144
01:53:22,140 --> 01:53:25,340
Participate at orangeslaundry.com if you want to send us an email

2145
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:28,540
on any topic, whether we did or we didn't talk about it.

2146
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:30,460
I would also usually talk about Drag Race here.

2147
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:36,860
I don't think Dark Soccer is watching, but there's spoiler alert for this week's Drag Race.

2148
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:43,100
Sorry, there's a top five this year because in this season we don't eliminate people.

2149
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:45,260
So five girls got to the end.

2150
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,580
So I was going to ask if you have a fave.

2151
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:49,020
How do they get rid of people?

2152
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:54,540
No, they have been getting rid of people, but it's so like there was a double save this week.

2153
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:56,860
A chocolate bar saved somebody this week.

2154
01:53:56,860 --> 01:53:59,820
There was a, um, they didn't get rid of somebody.

2155
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:01,580
Twist every round, right?

2156
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:05,740
They're stretching it out as long as possible to get more episodes out of it so they can

2157
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:07,980
charge more when the show is inevitably syndicated.

2158
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:10,460
That's what they're doing.

2159
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:13,740
But anyway, um, so, so there's a top five.

2160
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:16,060
They didn't want to eliminate any of the bottom two this last week.

2161
01:54:16,060 --> 01:54:18,700
So Willow Pill and, uh, Angeria were in the bottom two.

2162
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:23,900
Of course they were because they're friends and, uh, both made it through to the finale.

2163
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:26,700
So I'm, I'm curious if Dark Soccer has a fave.

2164
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,220
Our local girl is still in it.

2165
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:30,460
Lady Camden is in the finals.

2166
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:31,580
I haven't watched any of it.

2167
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:32,140
Oh, okay.

2168
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:37,900
I like Willow Pill, but I kind of have to root for the local one, even if, um, she's local.

2169
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:41,900
Well, she lives in SAC, but she performs in San Francisco.

2170
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:44,780
So I, I, she, she really, Oh, Lady Camden.

2171
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:45,980
Okay.

2172
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:46,220
Yeah.

2173
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:51,100
So, which I, I did not know that name before Drag Race because I think she performs in

2174
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:52,380
the Bay Area that much.

2175
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:54,460
Um, but she's, I think I might've seen her at Hamburger Mary's.

2176
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:56,940
Oh, fuck.

2177
01:54:56,940 --> 01:54:58,300
Maybe I did too, actually.

2178
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:00,620
Now that you say that.

2179
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:02,700
Now that you say that vaguely familiar.

2180
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:04,060
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

2181
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:04,620
All right.

2182
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:10,540
Anyway, so, um, she, she's, I would, she's kind of the front runner.

2183
01:55:10,540 --> 01:55:15,980
I think a lot of the fans kind of want Willow Pill, but I, she's, she's won like three challenges.

2184
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:22,140
So we, we may have a Sacramento girl actually win fucking Drag Race this year, which is wild to me.

2185
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:23,580
So I know.

2186
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:23,980
Right.

2187
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:24,620
Yeah.

2188
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:25,020
All right.

2189
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,620
Anyway, um, let's move on.

2190
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:30,300
Maybe we can actually see some of our friends who perform in Sacramento up.

2191
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:31,500
That would be nice.

2192
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:31,980
That'd be nice.

2193
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:32,700
There's some girls here.

2194
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:33,660
I'd love to see on the show.

2195
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:38,460
Um, uh, moving on, let's actually, Dragula is the one I want to see.

2196
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:45,580
I yeah, there's like, I can't say I have seen land insider perform and it was amazing.

2197
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:52,620
There's, I'm, I'm, I am completely biased because I've hosted these people numerous times,

2198
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:55,500
but I would love to see like Chris front is here locally.

2199
01:55:55,500 --> 01:56:00,220
I would love to see them on the, on, and red fulfill, I think would be incredible and regular.

2200
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:01,820
So shout out to my locals.

2201
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:08,220
So anyway, um, moving on, let's, uh, let's get into other stuff.

2202
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:09,340
Last minute stories.

2203
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:10,220
Loki, you have anything?

2204
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:14,140
No, it's that kind of week, huh?

2205
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:17,020
I'm just reading up on the, the more in television.

2206
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:18,860
More drama.

2207
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:19,420
Great.

2208
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:20,540
Well, just the same.

2209
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:28,300
It's so I think there's still, they have, uh, uh, I don't know where I think it's from

2210
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:32,620
Twitter or something, or maybe even one of like a feedback in one of their fundings that

2211
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:38,060
they were doing, but basically saying that, Hey, you know, that, that, um, galaxy purple

2212
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:43,420
that was exclusive, the GameStop, well, now you can pre-order that, uh, through the television

2213
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:48,300
Mico site, because it's no longer going to be getting some exclusive because they may

2214
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,660
not even be carrying it.

2215
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:51,420
What?

2216
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:54,540
Cause, cause that's why they canceled the orders.

2217
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:57,820
So, uh, I just think that it's absolutely silly.

2218
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:01,820
That they're still taking pre-orders on it, even though they know that it's not coming.

2219
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:02,060
Yeah.

2220
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:07,900
Well, I'm still holding out hope that I get one because at this point it's a collector's

2221
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:08,540
item.

2222
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:12,300
I don't, even if it's the showgirls of gaming consoles, I don't care.

2223
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:14,700
Like I it's, it's a collector's item.

2224
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:16,060
You you'll laugh at me now.

2225
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:20,220
And then in 10 years you'll want to play it like, so laugh away.

2226
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:20,860
Ha ha ha.

2227
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:21,980
All right.

2228
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:27,660
Anyway, uh, let's see, go into some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash a Vogue

2229
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:31,660
and network, uh, bonds, double a six saying a dead by daylight on the unreal five engine

2230
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:35,660
for couch, local co-op, you know, there's going to come a point where that they're going

2231
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:36,940
to have to remake that game.

2232
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:40,620
Basically, they're going to have to, cause we all, the, the longest running joke in the

2233
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:44,460
community is that it's spaghetti coated to hell.

2234
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:47,740
That like it's, it's being held together with duct tape at this point.

2235
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:52,220
Um, they changed, they change a graphic somewhere over here and a killer ability breaks.

2236
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:53,500
It's it's wild.

2237
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:56,860
So, um, they're going to need to redo that game from scratch at some point.

2238
01:57:56,860 --> 01:58:02,300
I don't know if that means dead by daylight too, or what that is, but, um, yeah, uh, bonds

2239
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:06,780
double six is also saying 2024 is too soon for an unreal game.

2240
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,100
Somebody had brought up a like unreal tournament.

2241
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:11,660
Uh, give me unreal tournament 2025.

2242
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:13,820
Now they have three years, even a damn demo.

2243
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:17,260
Well, I will probably start seeing the UE five stuff.

2244
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:20,860
You know, you'll see indie stuff probably sooner rather than later, but I think you'll

2245
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:23,420
see the real oomph from that engine.

2246
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:25,820
Uh, probably, you know, start to see it next year.

2247
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:30,380
You know, um, rumor is that kingdom hearts four is going to be in UE five.

2248
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:34,700
So, you know, you'll see that hypothetically someday.

2249
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:41,020
Your grandkids might the next generation.

2250
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:42,220
All right.

2251
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:42,720
Anyway.

2252
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:43,920
All right.

2253
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:47,260
Well, with that, we're out of material.

2254
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:48,860
We're at the end.

2255
01:58:48,860 --> 01:58:49,420
C'est la fin.

2256
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:51,100
Anybody else have anything?

2257
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:56,860
Um, um, marathon Thursday.

2258
01:58:56,860 --> 01:58:57,360
Yes.

2259
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:58,140
Hang out with me.

2260
01:58:58,140 --> 01:59:00,940
And you're not going to be here for the next OLR because you're out of town.

2261
01:59:00,940 --> 01:59:01,980
I'll eat a whole cake.

2262
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:05,500
I'll be fine.

2263
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:05,980
I'll come say hi.

2264
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:13,980
Yeah, I'm not going to be here, uh, cause that is the day that I am, uh, driving to,

2265
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,140
uh, stay with Marissa.

2266
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:18,540
Tell her I said hi.

2267
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:19,180
I miss her.

2268
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:19,980
I miss her.

2269
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:21,500
I will.

2270
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:23,260
I miss Marissa too.

2271
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:24,380
That'd be great.

2272
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:24,860
Have fun.

2273
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:27,660
You're going to Disney, right?

2274
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:28,780
Or did that change?

2275
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:30,540
Yeah, I'm going to Disneyland.

2276
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:37,660
I'm also meeting up with, uh, with, uh, our streamer friends, uh, Nick and Prince and

2277
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:39,820
hopefully Nathan and hopefully Isaaco.

2278
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:40,380
That's great.

2279
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:41,260
Tell them all I said hi.

2280
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:43,180
I sure will.

2281
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:44,620
Awesome.

2282
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:45,100
Awesome.

2283
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:46,220
You get some comments from chat.

2284
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:49,180
Bonds double six is tell Marissa I said hello as well.

2285
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:52,540
So let Marissa know the chatters are thinking of her.

2286
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:54,700
Marissa, our chat says hi and they miss you.

2287
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:57,900
All right.

2288
01:59:57,900 --> 02:00:00,460
Um, that is, that is it.

2289
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:01,260
That's going to do it.

2290
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:04,140
So, uh, let's wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts.

2291
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:07,100
Oh, before I do that, of course, I want to thank you guys as always for listening to

2292
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:07,820
orange launch radio.

2293
02:00:07,820 --> 02:00:11,340
Thank you for being here, participating with our show, even on a short week that was a

2294
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:12,300
little lighter on the news.

2295
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:12,860
What can you do?

2296
02:00:12,860 --> 02:00:13,740
It's April.

2297
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:16,700
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show.

2298
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:19,820
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if

2299
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:21,420
the voices aren't here to put out on air.

2300
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:24,460
So, uh, help us grow our community.

2301
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:27,420
Uh, spread the word about vog network here on Twitch.

2302
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:31,420
A follow goes an awful long way and we really appreciate those follows.

2303
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:32,140
So what was that?

2304
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:36,220
Make my monster grow, make my monster grow.

2305
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:37,740
Uh, that's it.

2306
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:41,020
Um, join our discord vog network.com slash discord.

2307
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:42,940
Talk to us throughout the week.

2308
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:44,540
Uh, submit story ideas.

2309
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:45,580
That's fabulous as well.

2310
02:00:46,220 --> 02:00:47,820
Let's get everybody's final thoughts.

2311
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:49,420
We will start, of course, with dark soccer.

2312
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:54,940
Um, people are salty and MMR sucks.

2313
02:00:56,780 --> 02:00:57,660
Hopefully they fix it.

2314
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:58,220
I'll see you on the flip side.

2315
02:00:58,220 --> 02:00:58,860
I've been trying.

2316
02:00:58,860 --> 02:00:59,580
All right.

2317
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:00,380
We'll see you in a little bit.

2318
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:02,940
Dark soccer, everybody.

2319
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:04,620
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2320
02:01:05,340 --> 02:01:09,260
My final thought is also, uh, part of, I guess, the last minute story.

2321
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:12,860
So as I was talking about the amico stuff, um, so they did put out, I guess,

2322
02:01:12,860 --> 02:01:18,220
an email or something to, um, people that had stuff pre-ordered and they're trying to

2323
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:23,820
get folks that had pre-orders at GameStop to now pre-order them directly through Intellivision.

2324
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:29,980
And they listed new prices for the Galaxy purple and vintage wood grain.

2325
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:34,620
They went three, three 39 99 for a console with two controllers,

2326
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:37,660
two 89 99 for console with one controller.

2327
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:40,940
And they're not taking any pre-orders right now on black or the white systems.

2328
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:46,460
So it sounds like they're trying to end.

2329
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:51,740
Apparently folks that have tried to request a refund on their, um, pre-orders have gotten

2330
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:52,620
no money back.

2331
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:58,860
They say right now, though, um, that they're not taking for all new orders going forward.

2332
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:03,740
No deposit will be required until we finalize and announce a manufacturing date.

2333
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:10,780
Um, but for all those who did already pre-order, you know, with a deposit, yeah, you can get

2334
02:02:10,780 --> 02:02:11,180
that back.

2335
02:02:13,980 --> 02:02:14,300
Great.

2336
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:19,020
Again, when am I going to learn this Kickstarter lesson?

2337
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:19,500
I don't know.

2338
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:20,620
All right.

2339
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:28,380
My final thought for tonight is what on earth am I going to do with 16 shiny mudkips?

2340
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:31,820
What am I going to do with 16 shiny mudkips?

2341
02:02:32,860 --> 02:02:34,780
Now granted question for Shane.

2342
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:38,940
Well, I caught like three of them the first time, but I caught like a loop.

2343
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:43,340
I caught too many today and I only played for like an hour and a half.

2344
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:44,700
I just walked around the Capitol.

2345
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:45,340
That was it.

2346
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:47,260
Gosh.

2347
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:47,660
Wow.

2348
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:49,420
And in chat, they're like, I only got five tail.

2349
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:50,300
I only got four day.

2350
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:54,060
Oh no, I could barely play the first mudkip day today.

2351
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:55,980
I got 12.

2352
02:02:57,740 --> 02:02:58,620
I got 12 today.

2353
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:02,380
All zero stars.

2354
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:06,620
Oh, I only got, I had a three star from the first mudkip day somehow.

2355
02:03:06,620 --> 02:03:10,940
So that's the one I've kind of been investing all the candy in, but I don't have any stardust.

2356
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,460
Keep burning it anyway.

2357
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:12,780
Yay.

2358
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:13,580
Pokemon go.

2359
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:15,980
I'm level 53 in Pikmin though.

2360
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:17,180
I'm kicking that game's ass.

2361
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:18,060
All right.

2362
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:20,300
That's it, everybody.

2363
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:21,020
That's going to do it.
