{"text": " This week, a bunch of Nintendo emulation rumors made the rounds. This is your reminder that Nintendo has done emulation multiple times already and the slowness of rolling out games is less technical, though programming is always some part of it but more often licensing. The Nintendo Switch Online SP games are a cute addition that is most thoroughly technical and I appreciate Nintendo's effort to add a new twist into these games as well. This is just one throwback content headline. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this rumor and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice. Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode number 911 of our show for tonight, April the 24th of 2022. And as I was as was pointed out to me on the Bobby Blackwell show before our show tonight, apparently the 10 year anniversary of VOG Network which soft launched about what April 26th or so in 2012. How about that? My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. Oh, hi. Hi Dark Sakura. How are you? I'm all right. How are you? I'm doing well. Let me just take a quick minute to point out not joining us tonight. Unfortunately, Tech Master Loki, as mentioned on a previous episode of Orange Lounge Radio, Loki had surgery earlier this week. He's been giving updates through his Twitter account at Loki O-L-R. And I am pleased to report he is out of surgery doing fine. And I think in one of his tweets, he said it was getting better every hour. So he's just he's just at that point where he's got to let the body heal. So I would imagine instead of doing the show tonight, he's sleeping. And quite frankly, what a great thing to be doing. I think, you know, and Dark Sakura, myself perfectly healthy, but a nap sounds great, to be honest. So anyway, Honestly, many naps sound great. I we're going I start back in the office one day a week, starting tomorrow. And the whole thought is just filling me with like bits and pieces of dread. Because the moment if I if I get sick, I'm taking it to HR. Is everybody going back the same day or are they staggering it? I think you get to pick your one day a week out of like, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday. Okay, so there's a chance not everybody will be there the same day. So it's a little bit Yeah, but still, now. Now that you know, really, vaccinated or boosted status really isn't doing a whole lot to, to starve off who gets sick, just the severity of it. Um, I've got concerns then again, I came back from Disneyland just fine. I was gonna say let's talk about the happy stuff. You weren't here last week. No, no surgery. It was a birthday thing that you were doing last week. Yeah, it was my birthday. My birthday is very important holiday. But you you went to Disneyland. I did. I am I had a very, very good time, although my body certainly reminded me that it it's it's not a teenager, even though I tried to run around like I was so, so it actually my whole thing started before then because Sunday I wasn't I wasn't here. So what I ended up doing is I drove down on Sunday kind of rushed my way down and stayed with Marissa, and Chris is our lovely friend, Marissa, who has been on the show a few times and been in chat does some voice acting stuff, which is Yeah, I haven't seen Marissa in years. So it was a really pleasant visit. So you had a good time. And then, and the area that that the two of them live in is actually really pretty. I'd never been to the Moorpark before. And it's sort of up in the hills. And it was a little bit harrowing of a drive because my maps took me kind of a backwards way. But I'm glad it did because it was really pretty. And then the next day, I went to pick up Tiara, which cements how much I hate LAX. And so I managed to get Tiara out of the clutches of the the worldway traffic. And we went to Anaheim and had sort of a late lunch at this place called Requiem, which is a Final Fantasy themed coffee bar. I had no idea there was a place like that. That's cool. It's beautiful. Oh, awesome. It's not far from the park, you know, so it's near where our hotel was, even though I got bad directions because I put in the wrong days in. There's like 50 million days in. Oh, yeah. They're all days in by the park, need to specify which ones which. So so we spent a really decent amount of time there. It was really, really, you know, and they serve you like these little toasties. I had a Caprice one, which was, you know, basil and mozzarella and tomato, and it had this like really good balsamic glaze on it. And I laughed because Tiara had edamame toast, and I was calling it Japanese beans on toast because edamame beans, you know, and and then we went to the hotel. We had like dinner at Shakey's, which I've never been to Shakey's Dan thinks that I didn't even know they still existed. That's what blew my because you texted me that right next door to our hotel. Yeah, you texted me that you were a tiara at Shakey's and I was like, they're still around. Like they all the Did you know the original I mean, you probably didn't but I'm gonna share it anyway. The original Shakey's pizza was in Sacramento. The very first Shakey's pizza was Sacramento. It's now the mimosa house down on 65th. That was the original Shakey's. So I and I remember Dan telling me about it before. Yeah, and it's it's it's wild that like they're still open because they are they're all gone here. I haven't seen one in years. But yeah, the the big wooden doors. Yeah. And the arcade they always had a really big arcade area like most roundtables games there. Yeah. I really wanted to play like like a deer hunting and some Oh, like, well, it's a Walmart arcade at this point. Gross. Kind of. Um, but they put way too much basil on my pizza. I was like, I love basil and this is excessive. So and so the next day we went in for opening and our mutual friend Nick was came to meet us and I he actually ran into traffic so it was a little bit late but then he hung out for a decent time traffic in LA what no no Nick straight next streamer here on Twitch you and I have both rated him a million times yeah so really just just a cool guy all together really sweet really fun to hang out with and then after after a little bit he rode a California screaming with us or not screaming it's a credit coaster yeah credit coaster yeah and and we we we just had a really good time and then he had to go off and it was me and tiara for a while and we had dinner at Carthay circle I got a really delicious drink it's like branding creme de cacao and coffee and cream but it like it kind of got my stomach funny and I had Moroccan meatballs which I should have realized that there was going to be something spicy in it so I ended up like having a slight allergic reaction but it wasn't bad but I mean I got to pilot the Millennium Falcon I wish I had been right pilot next time I want to be a gunner the gunners look like they had a lot more fun is the gunner the one that just pushes the button the whole time because I think that's what I did that's the engineer okay that's why I just yeah I just kept pushing a button in the back row you're an engineer I thought I was in the middle but I it was a while ago then you're a gunner okay I don't remember it was a while ago the pilots had a decent amount of stuff to do but I I wanted to do the hyperdrive so I'm gonna wait and do that next time it was really really cool I I had a good time with that one I really enjoyed it the sense of motion was fairly realistic too and we did you know we did Haunted Mansion we did Indy we did Jungle Cruise we had a really really good tour guide who I'm fairly certain was non-binary and had some really funny Mean Girls oriented jokes fun did you get to do Rise of the Resistance or too crazy I didn't do Rise of the Resistance it had I didn't put in for the thing and honestly I was like it's a hassle the only thing I really wanted to do was with Smugglers Run okay I had blue milk I will go on record right now saying that if your throat is sore drink the blue milk it is somewhat coating and very relaxing but the other good news it's been a week now since you've been back and no symptoms of the big C so and I did a rapid test oh good good and so my rapid test was negative I also though on the way out after I took Tiara to LAX I had lunch with Nick again and I was supposed to meet Isaac oh but work got in the way of that so it was just me and Nick and we went to really good yakiniku place hmm it's like the Japanese version of Korean barbecue yummy so um really good and then I had I stopped at the grapevine after the grapevine to get myself a massage and one of those like beat-you-up massage chairs because they're great and then I was checking the time for the Bravo cheese farm which is my other resort that I go to 99 or 5 version 99 okay because I always take 99 back that's the one for me is the one I go to that has the llama that gives no fucks because you know they built one like at the exact same place on i-5 yeah it's funny it's yeah two of them I know but I have to go to the one on 99 that's the one hmm and so I thought oh no they close at seven so I booked it I like was doing a hundred in my Fiat TV I made it on 99 like I there's a part so so for those not from the area there's two major freeways 99 with me you know I know but I was to say for those not from from the California there's two major freeways that connect like Sacramento NorCal and LA you can take 99 or the five it's it's and five is usually like trucker route cows nothing there 99 goes through all the towns like Stockton Modesto Fresno Bakersfield like all the towns in the valley you're going through on 99 so there's more to do on 99 but five is the one where you can drive a little faster because there's like no but less people on it but truckers and you know cows inside of the road now more cops on five now it doesn't totally surprise me people people do drive crazy on five like not just me they were doing some construction though on 99 but I was I was pretty I mean I drive a Fiat so when the lanes went narrow I could still maintain speed and it was it wasn't that bad but when I got there they're like oh no we're open till eight we changed it we just didn't do it on our website and I'm like fuck's sake so I hung around and they have more animals there but that that alpaca still gives no fucks he was just like I'm just gonna sit here whatever I'm bored I made friends with a goat and then I watched the funniest thing I actually have this little video of it where there's a bunny hutch now oh by the way I played with Marissa's bunny Snoopy who I I'm in love with that rabbit I'm gonna go back and steal him but the bunnies in the hutch like I caught two of them they look like they were just cuddling so they like a little video of the bunnies cuddling and then the other bunnies okay it's time to fuck and the girl bunnies like fuck you I'm not into this and she like bounces off and the bunnies following or trying to mount again over and over and finally she just like turns around at him and then she bounces off and he finally gets the idea but I'm like you tell him you tell him little girl bunny tell him you are not down you tell him to take no for an answer lady bunny all right not being lady bunny I didn't mean that in lady bunny way she didn't have on nearly enough wigs let me let me go to the chat believe it or not it's a video game podcast we'll get into that too but I do want to go to the chat over at twitch.tv slash of hog network where we do tape live every Sunday night nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show and Mike Deft is asking the five covers the whole state doesn't it yeah it ends in TJ it like the San Diego and Mexico border that's where five starts in the south and it goes all the way it goes through Portland through Seattle all the way and ends in Canada at that that town I can't remember the name of the town way up there in North Washington but basically Vancouver because they change the freeway changes names you get into Canada but basically it takes you to Vancouver Bellevue no Bellevues before now it's another B name but I can't remember the name off top my head but way up way up it's not far north of Seattle it's only like as I think the Canadian border is only like an hour or two north of Seattle if that so yeah but anyway yeah five five is preferred I still prefer 99 it goes three lanes more often you've got more truck stops you know yeah there's more to do there's more to see exactly and for me given that I'm still having that issue with you know my alertness for me being able to stop like that it was a good idea sorry I have cat drama going on behind me like smoosh always arguing yeah smoosh just chased cheddar in here I'm trying to see I can't even see where cheddar ended up he must have went behind the couch they ran in here so fast don't worry I'm sure folks in chat are dying to see the cats if I if I catch one of them I'll show them on stream don't worry so but yeah they're still they're still getting used to they're still getting used to each other so is cheddar coming out of his uh little shell a bit more he is oh he's at my feet he's he's getting better he's less shy than he was but like smoosh will pick on him like smoosh is starting to be an aggressor smoosh will like follow him around and then like do this thing where he goes and like snort like right at him like he's and then cheddar just books it and smoosh will follow him like that's their way of like playing lately now cheddar's like at my feet and refuses to move super adorable so anyway you hear any meowing that's what's going on is they're basically taunting each other so all right wait cheddar cheddar hold on buy me time dark sagra okay um I have five dollars and that will buy you two seconds of time haha um I don't know if smoosh is trying to be dominant though it just doesn't seem cheddar didn't like that oh yeah well cheddar is a very shy boy yeah he is so he let me he let me uh boop his nose he's super adorable like whenever I'm napping or I'm asleep cheddar will run in and like wants to like lie on top of me and purrs really loud he's just I think he's very very happy to be um indoors because we were it's interesting so I started cheddar and instagram and just through the whole process the people that found cheddar actually follow him on instagram because the adoption agency like you know we were we were fine with the link being given out or whatever so they they put him in touch and so we got to see because I I looked at one of the instagram and I got I could see um that uh I could see a picture of cheddar when he was found and they really cleaned him up like he he was not in good shape when he was found so but he's so adorable now you have to send me that link later yeah I will for sure so uh pod culture and chat says so is one more each dad's kitty it does seem right now anyway that smoosh follows alan around a little more and cheddar follows me around a little more but I don't like I also really don't want to play favorites like I love them both um it's just you know whatever it's what it is so yeah all right uh let's get into some video game news I mean we could have a cat podcast tonight I suppose you know considering that Pax East was this weekend I feel like the news is still a little bit light all things considered so you know what we probably could fill up three hours about cats but we will get into the news and we're going to start tonight talking about Nintendo and you know uh workers rights in the video game industry is something that's really been a theme on our show for the past couple years honestly and everything really came to a climax when we were talking about Activision Blizzard and still everything that's going on there I know you have an update on that later in the show um but this week the eye of workers rights in the industry has turned to Nintendo um there's a lot of game blogs are are talking about a Nintendo staffer who says that their right to unionize was violated and this is per a complaint that was filed with the national labor relations board um this also it should should be very important to point out this is a lot to do with contractors rights as well because contractors are really used a lot in the gaming industry I think more than is talked about quite honestly um contractors sometimes known as like temp agencies is another you know big thing contractors are a way to find labor very fast because a lot of your contractors have already done things like screening interviewing and so forth so they know that somebody's like ready to go um and you it's it's a good way a lot of times for companies to find uh folks to hire long term as well I got my job that I was at for 14 years through through a contractor temp temp agency yeah I'm heading on nine years so it's it you know for first but of course dark soccer and I also don't work in the games industry so it's uh you know um but this uh uh contracting company that Nintendo uses um Aston Carter which is a global hiring firm uh the uh worker is uh basically claiming the both of them violated their legal legally protected right to unionize and this was a complaint that was made with the national labor relations board on Friday what happens is that this contractor alleges that Nintendo of America and Aston Carter said they did concerted activities and quote coercive actions to interfere with their right to organize um now the filing only has broad charges so we don't know like who was involved what was involved we don't know any of the specifics but per report from Axios quote the allegations were likely to include claims of surveillance threats retaliation and either a layoff or refusal to hire um that's also mentioned in a similar article from protocol um there will be an investigation but a lot of folks saying you know what probably not nothing's going to happen uh a University of California Berkeley professor and labor expert Harley Shaken said in an interview if the NLRB is listing these allegations it's pretty serious and their ability to act is very real after these allegations came out a twitter user known as the boy came out and said they worked at Nintendo and said working for Nintendo contract for three years was one of the most stressful and awful experiences of my life co-workers were great but i was constantly under pressure of being let go for little things like going to the bathroom or being stuck in traffic an extra two minutes before work additionally they have an awful practice of dangling the carrot a full-time employee to contract so they almost universally never hire on just to keep exploiting them and keep them quiet i spoke up to try and better things for co-workers main reason i was let go tbh um again a lot of this to me speaks to contractors rights i mean there's a few things going on with this story right number one we've said from the very beginning since these Activision Blizzard reports came out and even before that this is an industry problem right so if you thought Nintendo was immune from this type of stuff i mean surprise now i get Nintendo of America i guess we could be thankful for a moment at least we're not hearing anything about sexism or you know some of those more serious things we've heard coming out of the activisions and like you know uh that that whole he was gonna kill his secretary or something allegedly i'm sorry i'm totally butchering the quotes but there was some really messed up stuff that came out of the activision stuff right you know i i feel awkward sitting here going at least it's just contractors rights but i don't i don't want to diminish the situation either i mean this whole thing about they could get fired for the littlest thing this is why a lot of companies and not just the tech industry quite frankly go to contractor agencies because yeah it is really easy to let somebody go sometimes i think the contractor agencies are predatory practice i see but it's it's weird because i also feel like it's biting the hands that feed me a little bit because sometimes it's worked out my favor in the past you know as far as like getting in with a big company um it just felt though for some of us i would expect the majority don't work out yeah no and i i'm i'm all for like this whole practice of how this works getting scrutinized and getting looked at and contractors rights being taken seriously please don't misunderstand me with what i'm saying um but i just say this a lot of these things that are being talked about i don't think are unique to tech either i think this is a lot with contractors and you know just in general how that all works so uh going to the chat because you know our chat is going to light up at this uh over at twitch.tv slash vog network deejirama says i kind of think that this person is mad that nintendo wouldn't flip their contract over to fte maybe so i mean but you know we talked about like the dangling carrot and all of that stuff maybe there is a frustration there you give and give and give and you expect that you know maybe you're going to move up the ladder maybe get some of the benefits you know and stuff that comes with being a full-time employee maybe it does get frustrating when time and again that doesn't happen for whatever so uh fanara in chat says contractors equals first one out the door yes as well like if there's ever a layoff or something like that almost always yeah contractors like unless they're highly specialized almost always yeah um deejirama s also says well even as a contractor you have to still follow the handbook of the company but they really can't fire you over silly stuff um quest bus they can reach out to the the contracting company and say that you're not a good fit i i have seen it and i i'll speak openly about this because it's not my current company and it's not you know anything where any of us are affiliated with currently but i've absolutely seen it where a person didn't show up to work for two days in a row and somebody would call the contract agency and say could you just let them know we don't need them back and send somebody else and it didn't even it didn't even really matter what the reason is just they they we needed them they weren't here let's do somebody else and that's what you know happens with contractors um and they can totally do it as retaliation i i was working with a mortgage company once that they were violating several federal laws and i called them on it and i told them why and i showed them the laws and like when i do this work i'm going to be documenting every piece of it i'm not going to have anything that i do come back and bite me and they let me go and yeah and then i filed it and then i filed a complaint and the company was gone a year later yeah and you know you know she just doesn't fit in with the culture here yeah i'm not gonna break the law for you anyway well they didn't last the the year because i'm not the only one that filed the complaint too yeah so anyway um just that's you know uh what's going on at uh nintendo uh is under oops sorry um i'm having problems with my computer over here where did discord go okay there we go okay um but uh another thing i wanted to say about this whole nintendo uh news is that nintendo did comment on the situation um so nintendo said we are aware of the claim which was filed with the national labor relations board by a contractor who has previously terminated for the disclosure of confidential information and for no other reason but that see i kind of like i get what nintendo's doing here and covering their butt but i kind of think that reason like they were watching him and he said something to somebody and they just they jumped on it you know what i mean like i i don't know this seems a little bit of a stretch to me but whatever i'm not i'm not there i don't know the specifics whatever uh nintendo is not aware of any attempts to unionize or related activity and intends to cooperate with the investigation conducted by the nlrb nintendo is fully committed to providing a welcoming and supportive work environment for all our employees and contractors we take matters of employment very seriously well then i would be curious what they have to say about the twitter user i talked about as well and other former employees whether they be full-time or contractor i've heard other stuff as well that wasn't posted as publicly um that's rather interesting so uh you know it was really just a matter of time before your fav in the industry had a good good look at it as well and so here's now you know nintendo's turn to look at what are they doing right what are they doing wrong so interesting anyhow let's move on and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week in how was your gaming week dark soccer i know you were at disneyland but did you fit in any uh video gaming in your week um yeah i mean i i streamed so i played dead by daylight and i played second and said to three um i have four of the mana beasts down or whatever they're calling them the the nevadons i think is what they're calling them i i just think of them as the mana beast um so um halfway through them and then i think after that after the other four then i have the last fight so and then i've beaten the game and i'm moving on to tear enigma probably whoa yeah um and dead by daylight i'm kind of i don't know i just like i didn't have any concentration yesterday so i was just sort of being you know whatever about the game it's just sort of like i don't care all right they won yeah whatever okay good sure yeah you can boop my demo dog i'm still going to tear you to pieces i actually played demo it was kind of fun he's a cute puppy i i didn't i haven't touched it by daylight all week i don't know what it is i'm not like consciously trying to avoid it or anything i just kind of feel like the game's in a bit of a lull for me right now i still play regularly for consistency it's also like double experience yeah i heard that was going on this weekend the eerie shards yeah but um um i'm still i still have fun i get frustrated sometimes and yeah like fanara just said new rift comes out on the 27th oh that's right it's a twins rift yeah twins and david maybe i'll log in for that yeah yeah so i have to see if there's anything you know worthwhile in it that i want that would make it worth paying for so i mean i like i who am i kidding i like all the cosmetics so i already have enough of a what is the orange shards i forget what they're called the oric cells that's it i have enough of those on my account to buy the rift i probably will whatever who cares i've actually i once paid for a whole rift as in like paid to advance on it oh wow okay and that was for all the pig stuff uh okay got it because i'm sorry i'm the pig mane um but no other other than that uh those are you know that my my wordscapes i'm still kind of addicted um didn't really do much else um yeah right just i didn't even play astro blasters um my gaming week uh honestly not a lot of new stuff it's it's two of my standbys i played a lot of both i played more no man's sky i actually was really good with my streaming this week i you know ever since the move and my life getting you know the raid turned upside down yeah you're welcome um it's since all that kind of turned things upside down um i've been getting back into streaming more regularly so i stream monday tuesday wednesday and one other day whatever day i rated you friday maybe so um yeah i've been streaming more it's weird um but i played no man sky on monday and i think friday stream the night i rated you i think i was playing that too um and uh yeah no man's sky i i beat expedition six so i cleared everything with that expedition and as annoying as it was with the increased pirate raids i think it made me a better no man's sky player for one it forced me to do an element of the game i don't normally you know pay attention to which is the combat stuff i would actually say it's probably the easiest expedition well the normandy one was probably the easiest and that was more because of the length it was designed to only be like a two-week expedition so you had to beat it in like five hours of game time um so that was probably the easiest one but i would say six was probably the second easiest one uh if you're willing to do the combat fights now i know bobby's talked about this on his show he really does not like to do the fighting he's more of a pacifist player and i get it like if you don't like to do the combat this latest patch is kind of annoying because they added more opportunities to get fights picked with you but another thing i learned is that you can pretty much run away from anything as long as you don't engage if you keep running one direction long enough or flying long enough in one direction you can get out of it without engaging it's just annoying because you know like a lot of things no man's sky you're doing one thing and then squirrel something else comes up uh that's just how the game goes but i enjoyed my experience in the expedition so much that like friday i was just like you know what i want to continue in this new game that i started because um i beat the beat the expedition like an hour into monday's stream and it was the last day for twitch drops and twitch drops take about three hours so i was like you know i'm gonna try to do a three hour stream let's just start a new game let's do a new game with all these rewards i've been collecting through twitch drops and everything so i started the game and then i kind of found like i was missing it i kind of want to play that game again um so i did on friday and um advanced my game and i probably will stream that a couple more days this week so i just i like no man's sky is just a relaxing game and the nice thing about streaming it is that you know enough especially with the twitch drops a lot more people were coming into chat but even on friday when there were no drops you know some some of the peeps that i've known for a long time thanks to olr and hanging in other communities just coming in just chilling out hey what's up you know this game is still pretty but just talking about stuff while i'm blasting rocks for dust so um yeah quest buster says i just found out that you can make squadrons and have a wingman warp in when you get into a fight they're not that great but they give the pirate something else to shoot at yes you don't really learn about that until the very end of expedition six but as soon as you get your freighter which in the main story or any time really it's in the game's code if you do five warps galaxy warps your fifth galaxy warp you will always warp into a freighter fight if you kill the pirates which isn't that hard you the freighter will invite you aboard and the captain will be like i'm sick of this why don't you take my freighter and you can get the freighter the minute you get that you can unlock at one of the panels squadron mates and they cost nanites like most things in the game does um but they're it's pretty easy to recruit at least one and uh yeah they'll fight by your side in some of those battles which is uh pretty nice so something to think about um anyway also i've been playing follow fantasy 14 because i was sidetracked by no man's sky with the expedition that was timed over easter weekend i um was neglecting the 6.1 patch in follow fantasy 14 which i finally caught up with this week so i streamed on tuesday and wednesday night shane joined me we did some dungeons i've done the new dungeon i did the new raid i didn't do that on stream i ended up doing that um like yesterday saturday or something i don't remember uh so yeah so uh been enjoying the patch in 6.1 final fantasy i'm playing sage for the first time which is one of the new classes that came out with endwalker and it's funny because i i played it for the very first time on stream on wednesday and i think you hear me sitting there kind of going none of these words make sense none of this thing makes sense none of but now that i've played it and i'm up to like level 76 now um i actually really enjoy the rhythm of sage it's a very like fast pace there's always something going on type of healer where you're doing damage and healing and barriering and so it's very like satisfying when you do it well but it can be tricky to get the hang of it first but i'm enjoying my adventure in sage right now in final fantasy and i'll probably take it to 90 honestly so that'll probably be the next class i get to the end game i still have yet to look at the pvp in final fantasy but that's kind of on like my list of things to do hopefully in this next week so that's pretty much my gaming week uh mike deft in our chat talks about most of my gaming this week has been pokemon either go or unite which some kirby thrown in there and that does remind me you know i don't talk about the um gps games but i should because they do take a lot of my attention yesterday was like niantic community day where they were doing stuff in all three games so pokemon go had the stuff old debut and all that stuff in the shinies um and pikmin had a you know their community day for tulips so i walked 17 000 steps yesterday because in the morning i was walking with my pic my ingress friends although there was a thing going on in ingress but it was kind of like very passive and not like so we we weren't even playing ingress we were doing pikmin and walking that and i got like 9 000 steps just walking with my friends and then i went back to the i had to pick up my sister at the airport i went back downtown after all that and i went out for stuffle community day and walked another like 8 000 steps walking around the capital several times so but i caught 19 shiny stuffles like it was again and i only blew i only bluetooth caught the whole time um it was one of those things where i was like i i after an hour and a half i was like i don't need this many stuffles i have 19 what am i going to do with these uh i'm done i have 1200 candies i'm kind of done so but i had a very productive day so that was my like niantic day so i always forget to talk about the gps games but i play plenty of those as well it's not always just final fantasy and no man's sky whatever standbys i have also i played my burger time machine a little bit today really yeah i was trying to see if i could get the if i could get cheddar to be interested in it because smush really likes the light and the noise and i was trying to see if i could get cheddar interested in it so i played it a little bit to get the noise and all that he didn't care he didn't care so it's interesting how cats like different things that's for sure yeah midna would rather just like sit at the at the glass door and just watch everything outside you know cat tv no smush used to like get up on top of it and all that stuff too but now the cheddar's here he's his pastime is very much watching and patrolling whatever cheddar does so anyway all right let's get into some more video game headlines for this week i hope you all had a good week uh whether it was you know playing video games uh or going to something like pax east was this weekend um i know that was the first convention um in a long time for a lot of people i also know pax east did hecka precautions uh with mandated vaccines and masking so hopefully everything is okay i always think it's a good idea if you're going to go to a convention like that or whatever at least take a rapid test honestly just take the the nose swab test from uh a medical provider like three days don't do it the day after do it like three four days after just to make sure i think it's just always a good idea um i plan on going to dragon con over labor day i'm sure there will be precautions that's fine and i will take a test as soon as i get back just just to make sure just to be thorough but the reality is in this day and age you go anywhere with a lot of people covet's going to be there somewhere you know you everybody heard the story uninvited guest yeah everybody heard the story at gdc about the person who knew they had covid and went to the industry parties anyway and that's just the reality is that's the grocery store that's transit that's the airport that's a restaurant that is anywhere a lot of people hang out somebody is going to go full well knowing that they have covid so if you're going to be in close proximity with people in any of those situations look out for yourself you know just unless unless you truly don't care then i hope you have a speedy recovery that's that's uh like those people yeah it's that's all i got so all right moving on let's talk about in games uh headline from ubisoft you know ubisoft not only in the working conditions uh environment but in the nft's environment has been in headlines a lot lately which makes this headline very interesting about a new project they are working on called project q and a tweet for ubisoft wrote introducing code name project q a team battle arena letting players truly own the experience the game is an early development and we will keep testing so for now all you can do is register for upcoming tests well you see they kind of were forced their hand on sharing this because a leaker out there actually shared footage of the game uh saying that it looked a little bit like overwatch meets fortnite uh it's kind of what it looked like there was a mode called showdown where four teams of two go against one another to decide the winner and battle zone sees two teams of four going against each other to see who gets 100 points first but even though folks are saying oh it's overwatch meets fortnite ubisoft was quick to say this isn't a battle royale game which is so it's interesting to see ubisoft saying no it's not that not that by the way this is not a battle royale the game will feature a variety of pvp modes with one single goal in mind fun fun is the goal yeah i like fun too we'll see we'll see if it passes the the rob roberts and dark sakura fun test to be determined at a later date um also and i what also kind of cracks me up about this ubisoft also went to say there are no nfts in project q um because selling point ubisoft has been known to promote well it also goes to show what a big company ubisoft is you have different developers within ubisoft so i think this team is probably trying to separate itself from some of the other things ubisoft is known for which i think is very interesting so uh again if you want to what was that oh i said let's hope yeah if you want to uh sign up to uh check out project q you can do that over at register.ubisoft.com slash project q dash sign up uh and uh the project is coming out for xbox one xbox series playstation four and five and pc uh let's hope this one lasts and uh doesn't go the way of hyperscape which was a battle royale but apparently was not fun for enough people because uh nobody was playing it and so they shut it down or they're shutting it down but it is uh being uh and dated uh orange right is awarding one pat on the back for no nfts um s2100 matt says letting us know there are no nfts gets one clap fifth fifth dream says a loud one just sort of like a bad muted one like a like a golf clap no it was like this oh the hands just there was an attempt at clapping um fifth dream in chat says pick a pick a better letter ubi what's wrong with q what's what's your hatred with the letter q fifth dream q's probably an amazing character i was just gonna say q's my favorite character and bond what's wrong with that i i was actually talking about star trek oh that too star trek too yeah let's remember some famous cues in history anyway all right let's move on to our next story dark sakura what do you have for us next well nintendo is doing something ahead of schedule um you know we often hear about like games being delayed but we rarely hear about them coming out early and it looks that uh zenoblade chronicles 3 um is actually coming out two months ahead of schedule on july 29th um but it looks like that instead of using whatever that early finish time you know to do more play testing and a little bit more work on it they're just bringing it out so who knows what that's gonna mean but we it's not like we haven't had games released early before uh like the upcoming game uh well not upcoming it's already out but the sifu that came out um it was due february 22nd it came out on february 8th and assassins creed 4 dropped early as well so it's not like we haven't had a few come out earlier but i still think that the date should be maintained so that again they can make sure that they have a good product here's why i'm gonna tell you 100 why because it relates to something bobby blackwolf said they bobby blackwolf in our chat says they probably have another game that will come out when xc3 was originally going to come out so they rearrange things also in the news this week splatoon 3 which hadn't been dated yet but was generally considered to be a summer game was given a date 9 9 2022 so it's going to get the dreamcast day of 9 9 so that's getting a september release they're calling it a summer release because technically you know summer runs through september 21st right so it's a summer release but it's it's september summer so um that comment from bobby i think is 100 on the nose splatoon ended up taking this i think i think splatoon got delayed but since they never said it was going to come out on a certain day it's not a delay but i think the fact they're rearranging the calendar i think goes to show that splatoon was probably originally going to be the july game and ended up getting pushed back to september which you know if it needs more time than fine whatever i think but it's it also interesting i just think xc3 has probably been done it's probably been done and they're they're in the final stages of it and it was completely about release strategy going into the holiday season and all of that absolutely but um especially when it was already out there that xc2 and three were in development side by side so three's probably been done for a few months now and it's really just a release release strategy thing at this point and so now they don't want to compete against themselves although splatoon and xenoblade are very different genres you're still asking nintendo fans who are probably interested in both to plunk down 60 and another 60 so it's best if they space them out a little bit so that they space them out a little bit so that you you know you'll pay 60 in july and then 60 in september um on a somewhat related note i thought it was very interesting you know uh it was there was a tweet going around earlier today that came across my timeline and it didn't make me stop and go that is interesting that we're talking about xenoblade chronicles 3 being a tent pole release essentially for the switch at this point right do you remember folks think back think back about 10 a little more think back to the wii era like 2008 2009 do you remember the first xenoblade chronicles game and how nintendo wouldn't put it out in america and yeah how it took a little operation rainfall to finally get that game to get released uh along with some other there were some other games involved with that as well um but that game finally got released it was a gamestop exclusive which i still to this day say was garbage but whatever at least it was released um and you know because many people were just pirating it at that point i may or may not be one of them but that game was so good uh at least it finally got in front of the eyes of other people and it's just interesting to me how far we've come because since then then we had xenoblades chronicles x on the wii u which you know it was wii u but i think it was still very well received as a wii u title um and then of course the remaster came out for the switch and i i believe it did pretty well uh well enough anyway to necessitate xenoblade chronicles two and three now so this is very interesting that like this series is causing release strategy shifts in the u.s when nintendo didn't even want to do this game in the u.s originally so can all of the supporters of operation rainfall please just take a moment to say we were right and doesn't that feel good doesn't that feel good uh bobby blackwolf says the lost story was the other one i think yes there was that there was one other pandora something was the other there was one other uh there was because there were three and they all did get released eventually um yeah so yeah it was uh pandora's tower thank you orange right that was the other one so um they all did of course the other two i don't think ever did get follow-ups uh was lost story a mistwalker title there was it was from a studio everybody wanted to play it because it was from a particular studio um but it never ended up yeah it was mistwalker so mistwalker kind of went a different direction and now um fantasion is the most recent thing they've done right so um yeah so uh but last story i i kind of Asian is great just you know annoying i wish they would revisit some of these you know it's such a fascinating studio because they keep doing these rpgs that just don't stick for whatever reason that's not i'm not talking about fantasion i'm talking about before that blue dragon i lost odyssey so kind of turned a little bit weird did it yeah the thing the thing is is that like playing through the game is easy the boss battles are harder than the advertised level hmm uh and bobby blackwolf says it was the last story not the lost story you're probably mind melding with lost odyssey which was also a mistwalker title it happens that was ways back anyway i'm sorry i just had to point that out as i was like here we are talking about release date strategies around zw a chronicles 3 when nintendo didn't even want to release the first one in the us so i just think how far we've come and kudos to the fans for speaking up you know as much as we talk about you know angry fanboys when it comes to nintendo i think operation rainfall did did it appropriately and look at the look at the big victory here all these years later now we just need the xenoblade chronicles x re-release on switch because a lot of people missed it on weu and it had great music all right anyhow when before xenogears came out that they had a mention of it in final fantasy 7 and no one got it because of how they spelled it right it was when cloud was in the the wheelchair and not himself and one of the things he would mumble was xenogias which is a literal romanization of how it would be spelled in katakana i love when games subtly reference each other i love it it's like this little inside joke that only we get i also i also love the concept of video games being set in like the same universe evil is in final fantasy i love the concept of like tactics and final fantasy 12 and in my brain in my head canon and i know i know yoshi p has come out and said no but in my head canon final fantasy 14 is an evil is game um and i i i realize there are elements about the story that definitely differentiate it from evil is but i it's it's uh it's an evil is in a different part of the multiverse game to me and i think i think 16 will be an evil is game too to be quite honest i just don't think that's been confirmed yet but that's that's maybe wishful thinking on my part but it is creative unit 3 doing it and it's those are a lot of the people that worked on those games so i think uh i think there's a strong chance 16 is an evil is game and i hope so so all right moving on speaking of great things from the past dark soccer well um oh am i i'm sorry am i next oh my bad i'm sorry you see you see what happens we lose one person for the night and the entire rotation gets screwed up well you still left him in in the show role for another segment well you know things happen that's right you were on last week's show always a part of the show yeah i was like you were in last week's show even though you're at disneyland so all right let's talk about this instead let's talk about nintendo uh and the nintendo switch online and uh there's been a leak of the nintendo switch online uh because it includes unreleased nes games um this was apparently something that was leaked over to um because this has to do with another thing i'm going to talk about here uh oh this doesn't have the piece on the um gameboy advance part hold on sorry i was looking at a story that talked about the nes titles that have been discovered in the emulator as well but it all started with a gameboy gameboy color game boy advance switch online emulator pack uh that was originally posted to 4chan sigh but leaks happened there uh four files popped up on there and some twitter users braved 4chan to get in there and talk and like see what's there uh there was a uh 7z archive that had loose nca's it was a gameboy emulator uh made by nerd it's nintendo's team that works on other classics for switch online the gameboy advance emulator calls sloop um so now some folks are saying you know 4chan it's got a hit and miss type of track record but the consensus right now is that this one's legit because builds of three nintendo switch online apps they're usable and they're playable and they're a source code that has identifying information from nintendo devs so all the signs point to this is legit otherwise this wouldn't catch fire the way it did um so we have news that a gameboy advance emulator is being worked on uh for the uh nintendo switch and there are games like pokemon pinball that show up in the list uh which i think are things that i would love to play all over again i checked something trying to follow back a link on one of those tweets and the account is dead the account's gone oh really yeah the one who was talking about the analog support and the helco emulator i wonder if there was an nda so because i wonder if nintendo maybe tried to shut it down or something who knows so that account is gone i wonder if this other one is anyway the other one is still there that's very interesting some sometimes people don't like the attention either and they might have changed their name to break all the links or something i don't know so anyway um but this doesn't mean that it's coming tomorrow it doesn't mean it's coming in june even it does it just means nintendo's working on it um but that could be working out in the way future i thought it showed interesting things about um uh like how they use save states to really practice some things in emulators and they actually had save states that talked about like you know there's a certain texture used in this part of the game and that they'll use those to test certain part of the emulators and that kind of made me click and go aha that's where those sp releases are coming from you know how on the nso they apparently like you know every other month or so they'll release like a kid Icarus sp edition and all it is is basically a safe state that takes you directly to the last level in the game so you can see how the very last level in kid Icarus is nothing like the rest of the game it's it's very unique i i feel like those safe states some of them are just becoming the sp edition of the game um or uh the other one that comes to mind it was one of the first ones they ever did it was the legend of zelda um i don't remember what they called it but it was the money filled edition it already had like every item 255 rupees it had like everything already unlocked and i was like that was just a safe state for nintendo to test things in that game that's what that was then they ended up releasing it as like a bonus game that's clever anyway the leak didn't just leak that this gameboy advance uh emulators being worked on is that there was also unreleased nes games including pac-man tetris galaga mega man castlevania lots of games that make you go wow this really is missing it's also interesting to note the build date for the application october 2019 so they've been on this for a minute uh-huh now of course just because now see here's where my brain goes i don't think just because the games were in the emulator they were ever being planned on coming out because that's a licensing thing especially because this has all these mega man games in there well hello capcom released a mega man's collection for the switch already they don't want to just give these games to nintendo for free unless i mean maybe they'll they'll get a money sharing thing later on but they're probably holding out but my guess is nintendo was probably internally testing these to test the emulator to make sure that it was still good in case either these games were ever just gonna you know they get the deal inked out these games come out someday or um and i think this is the case with xbox or emulation in general and i know we have an emulation expert in our discord server and i may or may not get corrected but just following this over the years when you get a certain thing in emulation to work it usually causes other similar games to work for example in the nintendo universe you hear a lot about mappers right you get one mapper carpetridge type to work it usually means others that also run on that mapper will also work i say xbox because i think back to that story when remember when like barbie dream adventures ended up becoming a backwards compatible xbox 360 title everybody was like why did microsoft waste their fucking time making that barbie game backwards compatible and i've been saying since the beginning they didn't it's just another game that we don't know of that they did want to get backwards compatible ran on a very similar type of coding structure engine something that the barbie game did and so you know look at look at other games of that developer or that publisher did and whatever microsoft did to get that game running also made barbie work and so i think and that's my long-winded way of saying these mega man games showing up in this emulator build may not really be about mega man it's probably more about the emulator because i i again i don't see what capcom has to gain when they're selling these games independently for their own money to just say okay nsl go ahead and release them on your service until they're sure that they're not going to make any more money off that game and nintendo opens up their wallet enough so what do you want to bet if these mega man games do show up it's going to be on the plus service expansion pack whatever the fuck they call it because they need that extra money so that they can funnel some of it over to capcom tetris i'm sure is a legal issue at this point um can they re-release the old tetris i'm sure it's complicated granted they have tetris 99 but tetris 99 and the original tetris on india they are different games and legally have to be treated differently castlevania and simon's quest same logic why would konami just suddenly open those up on nintendo switch online when they're trying to sell you the castlevania collection so i i think some blogs and some people on twitter are reading too much into this and i think maybe need to take a step back and go oh this is just more about testing the emulator or maybe these games are ready to come out as soon as the deal gets inked legally but i don't know if it will ever get inked legally pac-man um i hate to sound like a broken record but like literally in the next two weeks there's a pac-man museum game coming out why does why does namco want to put pac-man out on nso why they're trying to sell pac-man museum now i do look at other games in here like kung fu the original kung fu on the nes which was an arcade game as well i'm not sure why that game can't be released unless like was there an actual tie-in to something that i'm just missing in the moment with that game legally but yeah that's interesting i actually love that game by the way they must have some reasons yeah so i mean they there's they don't have to tell us what the reasons are that's just the thing they don't have to tell us but it's interesting the more people speculate on it that just generates more publicity for them oh sure sure uh now this is interesting over in chat ah thank thank you orange right kung fu was based on an iram arcade game kung fu master ding ding that's it that's why it's legally still tied up i remember the arcade game being awesome and then they they ported it pretty well to the nes so thank you everybody uh and dgrms says iram is too busy milking r-type to deal with kung fu well yeah how many r-type finals have we um s2100 matt says i remember when folks hacked the playstation classic and folks saw that they had tested a ton of other games on it including anime fighting games the whole list of games they used to test on it would have made that thing better than a dust collector for sure uh fifth dream in chat says maybe that contract worker at nintendo from earlier leaked the emulators i don't think the contractor would have access to those files but it's it's cute fanfic but probably not rooted in reality i'm sorry to say yeah all right uh let's go on to our next story now we can go to dark sakura's story so um well activision blizzard is doing something right um i mean then again they're kind of having to do it they have to yeah yeah um so they are adding two uh women senior executives to the board um they are announcing that uh lulu cheng miss messervay i guess that's how it's pronounced is uh joining immediately and then they're nominating carrie kar for election in their annual meeting in june um which so far they've actually uh activision blizzard has been in violation of law that requires uh publicly traded companies with six or more people on the board to have at least three women directors um and then half of activision's 10 person board has been together for nearly uh two decades um eight men and two women currently sit on the board um two however uh hendrick hart hartung the third and casey washerman have chosen not to go for re-election so um so uh messervay is uh the vp of communication at substack and car is uh svp with bacardi and an alum of the walt disney company so interesting there you go well the representation is important it's interesting that there's you know the law and all that as well with the board that's that's pretty neat um so it's good but um also i hope i hope these folks have been vetted um because that's still important as well because the next story we have is about an executive who is a woman who um maybe i don't allegedly not so great i don't know i've heard a lot of things about this woman uh and she's on facebooks i actually have one more little thing to add on please please if you don't mind yeah of course the soc investment group is actually urging investors to vote against uh the activision blizzard acquisition the merger so um they own a small percentage of activision stock um and they are calling for them to elect a new competent and dedicated board of directors that's my quote um before it's going to go through and so i think that this might be part of that this was announced uh last week i have heard of them going that in there yeah no that's perfect i've heard of a lot of pushback to bobby kotex payout too you know a lot of senators were voicing their opinions on that as well as that uh the deal shouldn't go through because of bobby kotex payout his ass needs to be kicked to the curb paid out in rotten prunes he needs to be paid out in a pink slip in a cardboard box like his contractors have he should be given a bunch of prunes and be forced to eat it before he leaves well wait until you hear what i have next dark sakura because it involves the tale of bobby kotek and the coo or chief operating officer of facebook excuse me meta cheryl sandberg that's who i was referencing a moment ago meta is under an investigation if cheryl sandberg broke company rules by um act by uh basically trying to do a favor for activision ceo bobby kotek who she was dating at the time oh how the world fuck i mean i just these bobby kotex stories anyone want to date him other than maybe having him be a sugar daddy but she would have she would have enough money yeah like she's i'm exhausted even just after the first sentence of this article but let me continue according to a report in the wall street journal who keeps breaking these stories that going on in the game industry so snaps and actual claps to the wall street journal and journalists who are getting getting it fucking done uh when it comes to holding these companies accountable uh according to this report so i have to say allegedly bold underlying italicize but according to the report cheryl sandberg used company resources to kill negative reporting about kotek so due to this meta is conducting a review and whether she violated the company's rules the british tabloid mail online was pursuing is that the daily fail it must be it must be the daily fails online the daily actually yeah the daily mail um yeah everybody calls it the daily fail they're listed by by that name so the daily fail was working on a story uh based on allegations from a former girlfriend of bobby kotex and a temporary restraining order that she got against him but cheryl sandberg and kotek worked together in 2016 and 2019 according to this report to strategize on how to persuade the daily mail to not report on the restraining order facebook and activision staff were both directly involved with this and the concern at facebook was that the story would quote reflect negatively on her reputation as an advocate for women because remember she's dating him at the time wall street she's really an advocate for women she wouldn't have been dating the shit yes i don't know what else to say uh the wall street journal also openly questions if sandberg inappropriately used her influence as facebook coo in dealing with mail online's management an unnamed source told that or said that kotek quote told people that miss sandberg threatened the mail in 2016 by saying that such an article published could damage the news organization's business relationship with facebook why is the daily mail called the daily fail because of all their fucking clickbait headlines and clickbait articles that they write on a regular basis who is the number one peddler of those headlines but they do have a big readership oh sure people and people believe stupid tabloids people especially if there's a grain of truth in it are you telling me dark sakura here on this day on episode 911 of orange luxury are you telling me that stupid people click stupid links are you telling me my point is that if they have a concern about this affecting public opinion of the piece of shit and her association with the piece of shit then it's a valid concern i mean they're both pieces of shit but now more people will know how much shitty they are uh pele hanumea and chat says bat boy marries princess diana that's the daily mail no that was weekly world news i'm almost positive daily mail will post like legit stuff every so often what does it what does it say what does it say about my sad brain that i knew which tabloid it was and to correct this well-intentioned listener on their comment i have i will be taking no i have no further comment at this time let's go back to uh uh this saga going on over here it should be pointed out the mail online never published its story on kotak uh a meta spokesperson denied that sandberg threatened uh mail online saying cheryl sandberg never threatened the mail online's business relationship with facebook in order to influence an editorial decision this story attempts to make connections that don't exist uh bobby kotak said to the journal he never said anything like that activisions board of directors said it did a thorough investigation into an incident in 2014 and that they have full confidence in mr kotak's leadership holy shit is that a lot to unpack right there because um i mean how many times has the activision board of directors come to say we have confidence in bobby kotak we have confidence in what's going on here when when honestly truly there is no reason to have that type of trust in bobby kotak they did a thorough investigation in 2014 what can you detail for me activision what that investigation was because it sounds like that investigation was throwing it a deep doc drawer locking it and throwing away the key if you would care to hear another quote boy do i have one for you the board has been aware of the circumstances reporting involving an incident in 2014 around the time of the incident in 2014 mr kotak notified the senior independent director of the board has subsequently updated the full board and has been fully transparent with the board the board through its council scadden arps has done a thorough and what a name i'm probably mispronouncing it but do i really care at this point has done a thorough examination of the facts and circumstances of the event satisfied itself that there was no merit to the allegations and notes that they concern a personal relationship that has nothing to do with the business of the company the board continues to have full confidence in mr kotak's leadership and his ability to run the company i'm exhausted anyway uh before we get to our next story i see the raid there from bromigos so i want to say thank you thank you for that usually uh we're recording a podcast and so we sometimes are really bad about doing the twitch things of acknowledging all the things when they happen because our podcast listeners can't see that or any of that but i do want to say thank you thank you for that it is appreciated and hope you guys are having a wonderful night um hi and welcome to orange launch radio we've been doing this far too long uh if i had justice the scrolls on the bottom our first episode was back in 2002 so i want to thank you all for being here for um our episode tonight uh dark sakura and myself here loki with the night off as he had just had surgery earlier this week and is recovering uh let's get into some more stories uh especially after that last story about really it's it's honestly it's rich executives scratching each other on the back literally and figuratively in this particular case and it just it's just exhausting to hear about and why mr kotak is still employed in this industry i will never understand never understand i i hope that once he's out the door that that's the last we hear of him i hope that door gives him a swallow a solid thwack in the buttocks on his way out all right let's i need happy news dark sakura make me happy make me happy only you can make yourself happy rob is it the same anyway um sega is doing something cool they are uh doing reboots of crazy taxi and just their radio and it's going to be big budget stuff too they are uh the projects are part of something called super game initiative it's a plan that sega sammy has had since last year so they wanted uh the the quote is um they want to develop all new and innovative titles with a focus on global reach online interactivity community building and ip utilization um and that's where the working with microsoft for the azure cloud platform comes in so they want to uh use some of its dormant ip's for remakes remasters and reboots and by name they said crazy taxi and jet set radio as candidates um other games on the list of space channel 5 res panzer dragoon knight shinobi um virtue fighter and altered beast yes to literally everything on this list literally everything crazy taxi and jet set radio were up on the top of the list according to bloomberg um they have um done remasters remakes things for other dreamcast era properties um crazy taxi and jet set radio were on the sega 2011 dreamcast collection there were more i actually have crazy taxi for ipad which is actually not bad um uh there's also uh crazy taxi ty tycoon which was originally called uh crazy taxi gazillionaire which is a business management sim slash idol game um they've outsourced a lot of their ip revivals though including streets of rage 4 panzer dragoon remake alex kid miracle world dx and house of the dead remake to indie developers so we'll see what happens but right now sega is kind of riding high on the the sonic revenue and um they're also looking into adapting uh yakuza and streets of rage so we'll see how that goes i want a streets of rage music uh the movie if the soundtrack is done by yuzo koshido well you may be in luck uh elsewhere in the industry this week apparently this i i swear i read this somewhere the sonic director is interested in streets of rage so but i knew about that yeah so but because i i actually brought that up two weeks ago oh okay uh yuzo koshiro said somewhere that he wanted to be involved that doesn't mean his phone's ringing yet yeah i hadn't seen anything about about that but i mean could you imagine if he did like modern mixes of the original music that would be rad um in our chat they're talking about like crazy taxi and these remixes um dark tetsuya says i saw someone on twitter suggests a battle royale style take on crazy taxi and it sounds ridiculous enough to be fun i actually think that would be awesome um like not necessarily 100 people but just even like that sense of like 10 people all playing on the same map at the same time trying to pick up the same people and get to the same spots i think that actually would be really funny that sounds really funny it's only fun to me really i think it'd be fun i don't like i i i wouldn't like that i like to get in and play it solo and be done it's it's always a solo game well it's not always be as an option maybe i don't even i know but i when they when they put options in games like that they have some sort of reward that forces you to play it and no um i also think um crazy taxi is not crazy taxi uh unless it has that offspring song in it because only sometimes they've been able to to get that you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like it's it's just not for me it was more about the the um bad religion music i whenever 10 in 2010 came on that was my song uh tiger cloud points out that whole soundtrack yeah sorry tiger points out it wasn't the sonic director for streets of rage it was the writer for john wick my bad um the other one i wanted to point out they were talking about panzer dragoon so quest buster says um as mike deaf pointed out panzer dragoon had a remake unless they're talking about rebooting a new chapter or the series which i'd love to see yeah i think that remake kind of had a soft land um it definitely needed a patch to get to the place where it needed to be so i'm wondering if it isn't maybe a new game or the reality is it's on the list but it's not at the top of the list and you know at the top of the list they've already done that that third party remake yeah as i mentioned so i i i would doubt very seriously i mean what i would actually like them to do is if they did remake anything is if they did a remake of a panzer dragoon rpg or what was it here panzer dragoon saga i think i i've got a copy somewhere all right um but that would be nice because that game is is pretty amazing all right well let's talk about about what's excuse me i have the hiccups you guys the worst thing that can happen to me when trying to do a show um let's move on and talk about uh something that sega is doing which is sonic origins and we got some new information on that this week so sonic origins uh is going to be coming to the the switch but i believe it's coming to other platforms as well i just happen to be looking at a story on a nintendo-based website um but it's a remastered collection of the original sonic the hedgehog titles um so sonic did announce that the release date is june 23rd hey just in time for my birthday and by the way it is the switch it's ps5 for xbox series and xbox one so it's you know most of the normal areas you'd expect um sega's announced it's coming out on june 23rd and it's going to be available in these different editions it's based basically standard digital deluxe and three different dlcs with it which is uh yeah that's a lot it is a lot there's a start dash pack uh with 100 bonus coins mirror mode already unlocked in a letterbox background there's a premium fun pack with hard missions letterbox animations in the main menu and camera controls in the main menu islands there is a classic music track with additional music tracks from the mega drive and genesis titles so i i don't know if all this is really necessary um but okay go off and honestly i'm gonna be honest when i first saw this trailer i was like what these games have been released so many times they re-released rather so many times you know we've had sonic one two and three and knuckles every more like since the playstation 3 xbox 360 there's been a sega collection that has had it in it i could swear sonic 3 has been in that too but maybe maybe not the current like genesis emulation or whatever all right they're saying in chat that sonic 3 has not been released in a long time i'll believe them that's fine but even then it's you know just sonic 3 i guess sonic 1 and 2 of you'll come out a million times um some people people also say it's because of the michael jackson involvement with the sonic 3 that that one's kind of the the harder one to get re-done for whatever reason but it's not just and to be fair it's not just that the games are re-releasing it's that they are done in the higher resolution so it's you know crisp pixels i guess there is new opening and ending animations for each title there are unlockables to get new content and special stages and then there's classic and anniversary mode which basically the anniversary mode is a full screen so it uses wide screen play the old games but in widescreen which is kind of interesting uh and as chat is pointing out basically they're doing these games in the sonic mania engine which is interesting but i'm not sure that dlc is a smart thing to do with this especially right out the gate to announce that all this is there they probably should have released it and then trickled out the dlc probably would have been a smarter way to do it but they really want to lock in those pre-orders that's for sure so but i don't know i think i think they're asking a little much for it considering how many times i've played played sonic the hedgehog in recent years but i do think that the widescreen mode it's interesting but is it 30 interesting i don't know so all right well let's travel back and revisit a classic game in our next segment and dark sakura what did you pick for the classic game tonight i picked tetranet yeah we've talked about it many many a time a lot of us have memories of it well i'm bringing it up now tetranet um and tetranet i apologize i need to step away for just one minute to deal with the hiccups i'll be back sorry all right tetranet is an online multiplayer version of tetris that supports up to six people and has team play so it first came out in 1997 it had releases for microsoft windows unix mac os 10 and bayos um it was developed by stormcat and the o is a zero because it was um the last official version is version 1.13 and it was originally developed for windows and later ported to the other systems stormcat also released tetranet 2 in 2000 that has improved graphics uh different types of special blocks more types and additional features like a hold piece and block shadows and a master server so um as far as um the game it basically is a standard multiplayer tetris with a twist if you clear a row it will cause special blocks to appear in your field if a line containing a special block is cleared then that block is added to your inventory clearing those lines at once multiple lines at once increases the number of special blocks that you get so at any point you can use a special block um at the at the start of your inventory on one of the six fields which is one of your uh either your own or other people's uh or your opponents excuse me so it depends on which type of block you're going to use so a is add a line where it adds a broken line c is clear line which clears the line on the bottom of the field uh b is clear special blocks which causes all special blocks to return to normal blocks r is random blocks clear so random blocks are removed from the target field so that gives you gaps in your lines um o is a bomb block which uh causes uh block bombs to explode and scatters uh other blocks throughout your play field q is block quake which causes blocks on each line to shift and sort of like an earthquake effect uh g is block gravity where the blocks on the field just immediately fall into whatever gap happens to be there and deletes the completed line um s is to switch fields so you actually switch your play field with somebody else and n is nuke field which removes all blocks from the target field the last player to still be able to place pieces in their field is the winner um and depending on the server use there are alternate rules sometimes there is pure where special blocks are disabled so it's just everyone is playing multiplayer tetris and then seven tetris where the first player to make seven seven tetrises is the winner so there are those modes um the music in this one um it it's it's called the dance of the spheres it's been everywhere like they made a step mania chart for this um what i don't remember that that's awesome yeah um it's the authorship is claimed by someone named uh david is it might be although there are other sources that say davy m carlson is the composer um back in the day we thought this was hot shit today i can't stand listening to it i mean i i was like okay jamming for a little bit a little bit nostalgia then after i was like okay i'm done um so there are also um different variables you can add to the tetranet uh 1.13 client different variables um one is called tetra tetra fast which removes the one second delay between the pieces that you find and the standard tetranet gameplay um after uh when the police sorry police piece delay is implemented on the client side it's just a modification that keeps clients from from having it happen to the you know you basically there's you only connect to people playing tetra fast um there's also uh one called tetranet slash tetra fast 1.14 with the 1.14 protocol is a variant where everyone receives the same sequence of pieces there's block tris um that's for the windows client um where it also supports the tetranet and tetra fast protocols but it also has additional special block types one is for left gravity which pulls the blocks to the left as far as possible piece change that changes your current piece and zebra field which clears every second column on the field um then for tetranet 2 um it's another multiplayer tetris done by the original creator um the five new blocks it adds is immunity where the target cannot be affected by any special uh for 15 seconds clear column that deletes a column from the field mutate pieces that causes um the target's next pieces a default of three to become large and awkwardly shaped darkness where you can't see anything on the field beside your current piece and its immediate surroundings for 10 seconds confusion that causes your controls to get mixed up for 10 seconds um and then of course there were other other clone you know the other uh tetranet 2 got closed down by the tetris company just like other ones did um the website and servers were unavailable for several years as of early 2010 tetranet 2 is back up and running uh and that's uh i kind of want to play yeah um the tetranet 2 website and servers have been recovered relocated and restored um this the with all of the you know various versions it was really well received especially by the linux community the uh linux conference uh linux.com.au um even had a programming contest where they tried to uh program tetranet playing bots that would connect to the server and play the game and the prize for best spot was forty thousand australian uh was sorry a forty thousand australian dollar ibm p-series server and there's also land parties um game revolution said tetranet was an affordable alternative to tetris and then in a review in 1999 of the next tetris game revolution said that tetranet was truer to the tetris roots and if you want multiplayer a multiplayer tetris the network-based tetranet is more fun i'm wondering if the existence of tetranet is what led to tetris 99 oh i'm i'm sure it's in part inspired by it for sure absolutely yeah you know when they were trying to think of like how do we do tetris as a battle royale somebody probably thought of tetranet you know and and you know how could we model it after that in some capacity oh for sure for sure really care by the way for the way that tetranet 2.0 looks yeah i like the way the first one looks better yeah but i like the overlaying grid over the pieces so for people who have like some issues with uh the perception of space and i'm not saying next necessarily depth perception but just more like spatial awareness having the the segments to the blocks make it easier and more accessible well we didn't uh in chat they're talking about a vog tetris night and def says uh tetris 99 has private lobbies you know uh a tetranet or a tetris 99 i think i'd actually like super be down for that i think that would be a lot of fun uh i think we should invite kevin ddr uh from who used to listen to olr years ago to just come and slaughter us all so if you don't know he's he's uh was quite memorable in the tetra scene for a while so i don't know if he still plays regularly but yeah that would be very funny all right all right well there it is uh i think that's all you have to say right that's your classic game of the week tetranet that'll do it that'll do it but that's that's such a good pick i love i love tetranet and you're right it's come up on the show i don't know how many times before so uh it only makes sense we spotlight it as a classic game of the week eventually around these parts right so all right um anyhow let's wonder why okay my discord was taking forever to kick back in jamie was a gray square for a minute there all right that's right um a lot a lot of ellos i have more stuff to do in a row so i'll get right into it are we really okay oh yeah it's rapid fire news hey when loki's not about to eat myself some rose jelly bellies okay when loki's not here we all got to pick up the slack but these are rapid fire news so you can talk about them rapidly well i'll let you chew that jelly bean and just mention in chat lol lol and dark tissue says idk how badly do you want to lose um excellent question i'll probably lose anyway i'm not that good at tetris um you know another tetris game that isn't played online enough is tetris effect it had a pretty neat multiplayer mode in it i don't know how many of you actually have it we should do a tetris effect night one night that would be fun i think so all right um i still like giant tetris which one the giant oh isn't that a sega machine the arcade i think it is yeah that's fun all right uh let's get anyway rapid fire news star sakura so um i'm sure we've we've covered this before the tmnt uh shredder's revenge this retro style beat him up that you can play as the four turtles or as april or s splinter well as long as as long as tiger claws here we'll always get the latest teenage mutant ninja turtles news well uh the game is actually going to feature the 1987 tv series voice actors you know cam clark and all of them are revising their roles that's legit pretty rad it is pretty rad and uh it doesn't have a release date yet um it has a window dot emu the the publisher working with tribute games confirms this summer for switch so it's gonna be pretty cool i've watched the trailer i'm pretty down for it also um press release time uh battle toes versus double dragon i'm sure we remember that back in the day on on the uh the nintendo entertainment system um it's actually going to have a physical uh reprint of it there's a pre-order window from april 19th which is my birthday through may 22nd um at 59.99 or uh 64.99 euro um put out by retro bit publishing and then they are planning on releasing the 16-bit version later this year that's awesome and that also i i real quick before we get into our next segment some of you were talking about that on our discord server this week and i always want to promote our discord server vog network.com that's vognetwork.com discord we'll get you an invite to the server and many of you post stories there throughout the week and sometimes we pull from that uh for stories that we're going to talk about on the show and i'm i'm always happy somebody sometimes people ask me my opinion on things throughout the week i'm if i'm surprised people care but i'm surprised or i'm always uh happy to drop my opinion on whatever you just tagged me over on our discord server so um dart to see us says i never got around to that one officially i'm assuming that's the battle toads and double dragon game but playing a bit of the rom it seemed kind of fun yeah all right uh we are now going always annoyed the shit out of me so i'm not buying it all right we are going to travel around the world and check out some release dates um loki is not here tonight so i will take up the us release dates and talk about uh what is coming out in the us so let's see today is the 24th so this week on the 26 demon gaze extra for windows zombie army 4 dead war is coming out on the nintendo switch and then we've talked about this on the show prior the stanley parable the ultra deluxe edition is out pretty much everywhere uh vampire the masquerade blood hunt i know we've seen some previews of that uh that is out on windows and playstation 5 so if that's up your alley you have that and then on the 28th bug snacks uh makes its debut on the xbox platforms as well as windows and nintendo switch so bug snacks is no longer a playstation exclusive as of the 28th for you cricket fans out there cricket 22 is coming out on the nintendo switch but i'm just i'm just gonna guess i don't it's listed in my american release dates although i can't imagine it's actually coming out in america but that's that's awesome if it does there's a somewhat cricket falling in the us that's true there's there's people who play rugby here too i know some gay rugby players they love it rugby is is preferable i think uh then we have rogue legacy 2 i think that game's been in early access for a little bit but it's coming out of early access for windows xbox uh won an xbox series uh that is all on the 28th uh tasomachi behind the twilight for nintendo switch and playstation 4 and uh quite a big release this week on april the 29th so uh just before we get to our next show nintendo switch sports that is we sports but nintendo switch sports um and that's uh one that we've had on our our ion for a little bit ever since nintendo kind of surprised announced this but should it be a surprise should it because this is a we sports was a huge selling game nintendo switch sports will have tennis bowling and sword play or chambara is what it's called in the game and three new sports soccer volleyball and badminton so uh you can uh hit around the shuttlecock in the privacy of your own home on nintendo switch sports i want to fence people as you play badminton so enjoy playing with your shuttlecock that is what and if you didn't know that is what they call the little thing in bat badminton it's the shuttlecock all right i think all of us learned that in high school playing badminton all right moving on to japan and checking out the japanese release dates looking on the nintendo switch uh pretty similar story uh we have um ike men sengoku toki o kakaru koi aratanaru day uh comes out in regular and limited edition from idea factory uh and that is uh where you are a fashion designer who goes back in time to an alternate version of sengoku era japan you have accidentally changed history and earned the favor of nobunaga oda by saving him from death so you must survive three months surrounded by famous and handsome sengoku warlords before your next chance to make it back home this game sounds too ridiculous to be true but it's true but it's but it's it's notable because it's you're it's like a men dating simulator you're dating uh sengoku so um that's kind of fun all right let's see what else uh food girls 2 civil war

metal tails overkill all right that that would do it uh we will soon get to the listener round table your emails your calls and all that good stuff if you want to join us in our discord for a call vog network.com discord by the way i i have a special need tonight i'm hoping somebody will call in because i'm gonna need help wrapping up the show tonight because dark sakura as you know she tends to go out the door before the credits roll because she's trying to set up for her own little thing uh going on after the show the after party that's going to leave me here all by my lonesome self so what you're what was you saying i was singing that song all by myself by myself yeah so that will leave me all by myself if nobody calls in tonight but if we get a phone call tonight i can let that person close down the show with me tonight so that'll be fun all right um but first intern yeah an intern tonight so let's uh we do have some stories to get to before we get to the listener round table so let's get to this uh first story from dark sakura so um uh wisconsin video game workers uh at raven software um as we know they are the arm of activision blizzard that works on call of duty um they and i believe that we've talked about raven before in this uh in this whole uh concept here but they have a unionization campaign by 21 of their employees in middleton wisconsin um as just trying to shake more of this up going on i mean they're working you know to really put it in there um but at this point um their regional uh nlrb director in minneapolis rejected um activision's push to have the election encompass a wider category of raven workers that would dilute the unionizing vote so um at this point um it looks like that the union the unionizing may be good to go so you know we we hypothesize this would probably start at activision and this would be one of the first to uh break the dam so to speak on the unionization in the game industry efforts and that might be uh coming to i mean we it's not the first time we've heard of the uni because we've had stories on the show weeks before there's been other smaller developers but for this to happen within activision would be something another thing too earlier this month um activision blizzard also announced that they would be converting nearly 1100 part-time quality assurance jobs to full-time jobs and raising hourly wages to at least 20 bucks so there's that all right and uh if you've gotten if you're getting a raise at your job and you want to waste your money on something uh boy do i have the prospect for you and that is more legos because an official lego atari 2600 is supposed to be launching this august um this is by promo bricks who kind of leaked this i guess um because uh this you know these things tend to leak out in catalogs and um you know uh industry ordering and things like that um so an official lego version of the 2600 console uh will be coming back coming out in august as part of the 50th anniversary for atari as a company uh the set will have a lego rendition of the console itself and also the joystick and a cartridge of pitfall which is interesting because that's not an atari game that was an activision game but that will be the game that will be made from plastic bricks of course very very similar to the nes system that's out there that you can make a little mario on the tv that runs it's super cute i don't have one because i was able to hold on to my money but i've seen it i think bobby blackwolf had one at his house and i was looking at it it's cute um and uh yeah it's a cute little system so uh that'll uh if the atari 2600 one has the tv and everything too that would be pretty cool so uh promo bricks is saying that the atari 2600 will be 200 i'm sorry 199.99 but let's just say 200 uh when it is a timed exclusive on lego's website this august and a general retail release in january of 2023 dark to see it says well i guess it would be either that et or pac-man uh i think atari wants to forget those two so it's probably yeah combat would have probably been the game for that oh hey loki's in chat shouldn't you be lucky shouldn't you be resting loki all right i knew he wouldn't be able to stay away all night but i was actually gonna say tune in next week to find out when loki plans to get his because i'm sure he's gonna get uh his own version of that but um i would also expect so so i also saw in chat uh they're saying that seems kind of cheap it says nothing about the operational tv with the game on it we know there's a pitfall cartridge that doesn't mean there's a pitfall game on the tv so i would imagine that piece of it probably actually isn't there um unless they you know unless again we're hearing this uh from a second-hand source i imagine when uh atari or excuse me lego and atari decide to officially unveil it we'll find out for sure but i wouldn't count on the tv being a part of it so all right that is it believe it or not for the stories that we had on deck for tonight so we're going to get into the listener round table we'll take your questions uh over at twitch.tv slash vog network but also we welcome your emails every week participate at orange lounge radio.com and as i mentioned earlier we will take your calls on the discord vognetwork.com slash discord i believe we have one email tonight so i will turn it over emails oh same person snap or i may have not thrown out last week's email check the date um you know i'm notoriously bad at that yeah yeah sorry last week that was last week's you know i rely on a clean inbox you are more than welcome to log in before sunday night to take a take a peek all right let's get to tonight's email hello lr i was not expecting the reaction that i got to my email last week ha as always thank you for your support of my games and i'm including the listeners in that as well rob mentioned that unlike with xbox live indie games falling plus is displayed on the proper xbox store unfortunately this isn't 100 true because although you can search for it and find it easily you cannot browse the store for it games included in the creators collection as it is called cannot be browsed you may recall that the store got a complete visual overhaul back in 2020 this collection had a browsable section on the store before that but now that is gone several folks have opened tickets or made complaints about this but unfortunately microsoft is not acknowledging or responding to these oh well i will also mention that falling plus is unfortunately not a play anywhere title meaning you cannot also play it on windows but if um if you buy it on xbox to anyone who would have utilized this i apologize but it's already available on steam and my audience is small enough that i didn't want to split it across the two different pc versions but if you post a score to leaderboards on xbox email me at yyr at yyrgames.com with your xbox gamer tag and they'll send you a free steam key that's good guy yyr he doesn't have to do that at all but that's just good guy yyr i'll end with a quick correction forza horizon 4 is actually still available on xbox game pass so if you just discovered forza horizon with the fifth game but would like to try the same game on a different map then give it a try while you can i happen to really like the version of the uk that they created thanks again for the show and have a great week looking forward to seeing peppy the penguin again erin yyr all right i'm i'm so glad uh you're happy with the reaction because i was happy to see it and that's a bummer that there isn't like a store like a way to like look it up in the store by hand you know a store page kind of like you were explaining there i just assumed because i could search for it and it had like you you were in the template in the store like you had screenshots you had all that other stuff i just kind of assumed oh okay it's in the store because here it all is but you have to search for it that's interesting um ssj100 matt also notes uh you can link directly to it because he just dropped the link in our chat room so you can actually just tap the link and buy it there that way if you want um it's it's too long of a link for me to read on air so i can't really do it that way um but i can just say search for falling plus or you can probably search for yyr uh and you'll find it that way too but if for whatever reason that doesn't work dude just do falling plus and you'll find the game i did play it earlier this week but i i didn't i was playing for so long i got to a point i had to leave i had to leave and i couldn't finish the game and upload my high score i should have just purposely died a bunch of times to get my high score up there but i'll do that i'll do that later this week maybe i'll do a stream who knows but kudos again yyr for the release of falling plus and um my bad on forest horizon four i guess it was three they must have delisted not that long ago i'm just getting lost amongst all those numbers can you blame me i'm not sure all right thank you dark soccer for that email reading uh participate at orange launch radio.com if you would like to send an email for a future week in the meantime let's welcome a special guest onto the show because i see someone in our green room so hello you are you are on orange launch radio who's this hey what's going on everyone it is ron well long time no talk i know right you know i had no i wasn't planning on calling in until that first article popped up i'm like yeah which article oh about about about the person working at nintendo that's oh basically mad they didn't get flipped to full-time employment what's your thoughts on that well i've been in it basically 20 something oh yeah it and contractors oh yes yes and the bulk of that has basically has been me as a contractor and the main reason you want to go fte is for the benefits and the discounts and all that cool stuff that's the main reason why but sometimes you'll have to be there anywhere from like three days to five years until a position opens up that you can get in there or if the budget is big enough where oh they could add another spot for you and that's it and contracting specifically is a very interesting world because you get a lot of temporary people that are brought in for transition work like we're moving from one cloud to another so we're going to hire contractors that are experts in this to help us with this transition and then we're going to let them go because they're only they're literally contractors they're here for this length of time it does a lot of stuff like that that i i would say is nefarious but it's oh it stinks and i'm sure i'm sure nefarious shit happens don't don't get me wrong yeah it basically depends on the company now i i will put this out there you know i was a contractor with nbc universal for about a year until covid happened now we had two separate it departments they merged them so the next open spot went to somebody in the other department because he had seniority over me and the main reason why i was putting my head down doing what i had to do is because i wanted those discounted tickets to universal studios and for the record i was going to universal studios japan so that was that was my main goal you got to see you got to see super mario world i don't blame you at all yeah that well yeah that and the sailor moon 4d uh experience oh shit that's a thing oh my god i want to see i want to take alan alan loves yeah yeah i i will find you information and i'll send it to you do you know how many bootleg vhs sailor moon tapes alan has in his closet i know i had over 150 bootleg vhs tapes until i had to toss them when i moved believe you me and when i switched to digital a couple terabytes of fan subs which i slowly deleted as i went to purchase legal titles and stuff like that but i've worked for a company called fresh direct where i was a contractor there and i ended up long term because i knew how to run help desk and do technical support besides loading windows or mac onto a computer and handing it to the user and what they did was they had a contracting division for those for union for the truckers you were contracting with them for x amount of weeks till you got flipped over to the union where you had all the benefits and so forth and one thing that some people don't realize is that when the company when the agency pays you x amount they charge that company double the amount to have you there which is why nine times out of ten you'll be at that same rate for more than one or two years because they'll be like oh we don't have that type of money because it's coming out of their bonus and that's why you work hard to show it you can do so that the manager of this company be like you know what this person's good i like them let's convert them you know and right now the company i'm currently working with i got the call about a month ago saying that my contract is getting converted so i'm basically waiting for the hr paperwork and so forth so in a way i do understand where this person is coming from but sometimes you you've got to you always got to watch your back because even though you are still an employee of the company you got to follow the rules and so forth the littlest stuff they will ping you for and what's interesting in some cases the littlest stuff they don't they just let that slide and they expect everybody else to set the proper example you know it's uh the contracting world is very interesting stuff and it's it's it's far beyond video games as well but it's interesting to see um how video games kind of play into that and how the industry you know really uses contractors to do um a lot of work that we don't always think about that goes into making games i mean it's not even sorry it's not even just like the testing of games and these are that but like we've talked about trade shows packs right now i don't know what big names are still doing packs east right now um but you know when it was you know nintendo and sony that were doing these shows the booths that were the people that were staffing the boost contractors yeah booth babes i'm using my quotey fingers at e3 in the pat contractors yeah so i mean and wait this happens at regular anime conventions too it's like you can be you go to a con and be like you can work a booth and get for 20 hours and get reimbursed for your badge and you still get to go enjoy something like that that happens yeah and the thing is it's like like nintendo can sit there and curate all these resumes and go through the whole kit and caboodle of the multi-tier interviews to see if they want you or not they'll let the third party company be like you know what we're gonna call all these people in they're gonna put them through those interviews it used to be where the agency will call you back we got your position you report here now it's like we have your position you're gonna interview with the agency to see if you are fit and if they like you you're going to interview with the company and so on and so forth that way in the event you do get converted to full-time you've already done those interviews all you gotta do is sign the paperwork and that's that um speaking of conventions i know you were somewhere this weekend because you sent me a picture with another blast from olr's past where were you at this weekend i was actually in the bronx i went to go visit j j vmont at his job oh you were at the store oh i thought you were at a convention okay you were in the actual store oh okay no i'm i have a convention this weekend i'm still catching up from the last con uh i i pre-ordered a pop from his store because you know even though that same pot was available at game stop i decided to cancel that pre-order in order from his comic book shop to support small independent shops good for you especially especially his our old friend there so even if i haven't seen him in a while he used to call her right once in a while but i i know business has been very busy so i forget i went there to pick up a pop and he walked and he he walked away with a hundred extra dollars of my money i bought comic book boxes and more pops okay aka shit you don't need you still walked out of there with it hey look today today was our weekly cost or no actually more our every three weeks or so costco trip i have no room to talk about buying extra shit you don't need look behind my head is a mini is a makeshift shelf that sits on my storage bins of all the figurines i have purchased that i have not taken out because i realized i don't have room for them in the display case but they're great deals at cons and it's like well it's within the seven to ten dollar amazon let me buy this you know i love it uh yeah i'll be filling up this place soon enough with that same stuff so yeah i'll say as much about one thing about contracting that i've gained from is the fact that every place i've worked at is same yet different i've gained a lot of valuable knowledge and training and skill but what sucks is when you're trying to go full time somewhere they look at your resume and see all these places and it's like well how come you haven't stayed here how come you're like my contract ended that was it that's all it was yeah i was up for a role i didn't get it because i had too many contracting positions and in a way i'm kind of glad i didn't get that role because i'm happier where i am now that's a weird thing to dq someone over for sure the person believes that when you're in it you shouldn't have all these multiple positions these roles i i know multiple people in it where that's the norm couldn't you just list your role as the contractor company and the whole time you've been there or are you going back and forth between different contractor companies just because i know when i was like that by the way well when i was doing contract stuff i was signed up with like three of them and i'm like whichever of you hose gets me a job burst is the one i'm sticking with i i do that that's exactly what it is yeah i sent my my my resume out next thing you know i'm getting all these texts emails and phone calls you know yeah it's for sure i will put it this way though when i started with where i am i um i started there with the intention that they would hire me because that's just how it works if you really suck you don't you don't stay on and i had my first interview for a completely different department and where i work they encourage you to wear different hats and diversify yourself and build a bigger portfolio and learn more and incorporate that into newer and newer newer roles so i know that where i work is also a unicorn uh rama i want to get your reaction to this quote in our chat over at twitch.tv network quest buster says a co-worker once told me that you can't spell shit without it look there is a reason why there is a flask on my desk it's regularly have a gimlet lunch break i i'm glad that they care lunch for us every single day and i'm glad of the fact that the one block over sells beer okay i love it all right well uh hey rama why don't you hang out with me for a minute here and help close down turn off the lights with me here tonight because we are getting to the end of the show uh and it's about time to wrap up but that means we're going to be saying bye to dark soccer in a moment but before we do that i'm eating my cheese from the bravo cheese farm rob oh yum is that um this is sage oh like a sage cheddar and this is a garlic jack that's that sounds tasty they're delightful that sounds wow um before we get to that though i do want to say thank you of course as always for listening to orange launch radio thank you for tuning in uh thanks for being here uh if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need the voices here to put out on air um a nice five-star review on a site like

it it is appreciated um before we close up shop here tonight let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts um dark soccer i hate to interrupt the cheese eating and self oh no that's you getting your phone up there i was like and selfie taking um but what is your final thought tonight um damn this cheese is good all right have a good stream and we'll see you next week see you soon all right uh let's see so uh rama thanks for being here with me and closing down the shop tonight everybody listen to anime jam session tuesday nights over at twitch.tv slash anime jam session you should just follow it right now while it's on your mind so you'll always be notified yes please do um well rama i i get to extend the courtesy to you as well do you have a final thought you'd like to share with listeners tonight drink more sparkling water because this cherry limeade is the bomb that i i've had that particular brand and it is good it's good stuff there's like nine cases sitting over here so i'm like i'm good for the next like three months i'm not the only one that stocked up at costco clearly so all right anyway uh my final thought tonight is you know what i need costco to carry and i've already talked about this on a previous episode of the show is this fucking quote coke starlight shit that's a zero it's so good i think so some people some people think it tastes like ass i think it's delicious and uh it was tasty i kind of felt a taste a hint of caramel while i was drinking i'm like it's lighter than normal coke this is good it tastes like raspberry to me it tastes like specifically this black and red raspberry gummies that's what this tastes like to me some people say cotton candy ah yes i don't know and apparently there's a new uh they're doing something like pixels i think is you know here i am giving coke free ad dollars but you know what here's the downside because i like this because i like this i drew this i'm already not able to find the 12 packs anymore and it's just i know it's going to disappear shit i love always goes away i feel your pain on that because there are certain flavors of coke and pepsi i cannot get here in brooklyn but if i cross the bridge to jersey it's right there but i'm just like i don't believe this actually happens this this fictional land of not having to pump my own gas and finding new flavors of pepsi all right that is it that is going to do it for another episode here of orange launch radio hey thank you so much for being here and participating with the show uh we will see you next week we'll be uh here to do it again next week hopefully loki will be back but if he needs another week and then he's going to get another week but seeing as i saw him in chat earlier he seems to be well enough to sit at the computer and is thinking about the show so thinking of you loki get better soon have a great night night everybody we'll see you next time and thanks rama thanks for being here and closing down shop
