00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,520
The standout story this week is Bungie pursuing fraudsters. A malicious party created fraudulent

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,080
DMCA requests purporting to be Bungie's legal partner in order to take down legitimate Destiny

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,200
2 content creator YouTube videos, and Bungie wants to bust those abusers. I'm in favor

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,560
of the DMCA in theory, but implementing it affects nearly every party in the process,

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,360
and we see nearly all of that in this story. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,200
Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you details on this and the rest of the week's gaming

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,160
news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,240
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:53,040
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,960
number 908 of our show for April the 3rd of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,160
every week here with my co-host. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,400
Oh, hi. Hi. Good to see you again.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:17,800
Yeah, well, I bought a $120 webcam for 45 bucks on Mercari brand new.

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,560
Hooray for sales.

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,920
Well, or however this person managed to get a hold of it and sell it, I asked no questions.

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
It's a nice Logitech.

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,360
Yeah, you look great. So good to see you again.

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,800
It's a 1080. I mean, I prefer the 4K of my iPhone, you know, but, and the skin editor

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
on camo.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,960
It ends up getting shrunk down to a little box when we're taping for OLR anyway.

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,400
And I also realized this is going to come in handy for my marathon because my phone

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,080
doesn't charge when I'm using camo. So if I'm going to be on 12 hours, I think that's

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
going to be necessary.

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,960
There you go. There you go. And of course I'm talking about some visuals because we

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,000
do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,760
of geeks network, twitch.tv slash VOG network, VOG network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,600
show. Also joining me on this program, say hello to tech master Loki.

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Hello.

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Hello.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Hi, Loki. I'm trying to determine what that game is. It's a very loud, bright game. And

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,520
it's not one I recognize. I feel like I should know it.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:30,280
Yeah, I'm trying to remember what the name was. It's something with a snail. It's, no,

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,320
it's called will you snail you, but it has nothing to do with the little creatures. I

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,320
don't see those in there. So that's interesting.

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,840
It does. It's basically so what's kind of the unique thing about the game is you're

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,760
trying it's like a speed run game, but the game has AI and will know how in will know

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,600
basically what like how you play and try to trip you up based off of how you play.

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,640
Okay, that's a clever mechanic. I'll give it that. Okay. All right. So it's like the

39
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,440
anti speed runner game. I kind of like that. That's sort of good.

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,800
I actually have a pretty nasty phobia of snails and slugs, right?

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,240
No, yeah, yeah. But it's a very cartoon snail. It doesn't matter. I can't look at them at

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,720
all. Like not even the giant racing one from the never ending story.

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,760
I only remember the horse getting eaten by the lake in that one.

44
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,600
It reminds me of like number munchress for some reason. Like, I don't know, like, or

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,040
like, I don't know, something like that, like an old PC or I don't know.

46
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,760
Yeah, it's got a retro look to it. It's like that retro. But like with modern graphic touches,

47
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,120
it makes me think of this was in the news this week, but it's not on our show world

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,160
tonight. So I can mention it. It's the the the doom. You know, that source codes everywhere,

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,920
right? Because people have ported Doom from the 1990s to like run on a toaster, right?

50
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,080
We know Doom is everywhere. Somebody got a version of that running on like race trace

51
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,160
with like ray tracing. And that's showing up because like a lot of people are saying

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,520
like, wow, it makes Doom look like a crazy like new different game. And that's kind of

53
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,440
like what the gameplay behind you makes you think of because it's just it's a retro game,

54
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,180
but it's got like new flashy elements to it. So sure. Yeah, yeah. So anyhow, um, let's

55
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,720
talk a little bit about our kickoff topic tonight because we are here to talk about

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,420
video games with you all in our chat room over twitch.tv slash a vog network. Bobby

57
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:25,600
Blackwell is there finding the link to the game that is featured on Loki stream there.

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,120
And dark soccer is mentioning the 10 ADP pro stream, writing out the tech that she's using.

59
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,800
If you need to get a copy of that for yourself. All right. Um, let's get into tonight's kickoff

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,760
topic and it can quite, uh, quite simply be put as nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,

61
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,040
nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, hey, goodbye. Uh, e three 2022 is officially canceled. It's

62
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,240
not happening. Um, good. I was going to come in here and do a whole, I told you so thing,

63
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,560
but then I realized, I mean, I feel like I've been kind of saying this for a little bit,

64
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,000
but the week where I really said like e three is not happening. And I don't know why you

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,200
all keep think it is happening. It is not happening because it would have been announced

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,820
by now. That was the week we ended up stopping the show 30 minutes in and it wasn't podcast.

67
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:20,120
So I'm like, Oh God, gosh, darn it. The one, the one thing I doubt you cannot argue. I

68
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,840
called it, uh, is, is lost. Yeah, this try had witnesses. A lot of life folks. I don't,

69
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,720
I don't recall you ever saying that. Well, guess what? Guess what? I ended up saving

70
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,320
the footage. I was going to let it cause today was the day it gets deleted cause stuff stays

71
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,320
on Twitch for two weeks. So I was going to let it get deleted today. And I was like,

72
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,120
ah shit. If I said that and I'm going to go to, I might as well just save it, whatever.

73
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,520
It'll be a, a special little thing, I guess. So anyway, it's there, it's there in the archives.

74
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,560
So that's fake news. Uh, thank you. Thank you everyone in chat

75
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,440
for inflating my ego. Uh, Jason, our, our voiceover guy is there in chat saying, you

76
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,320
know, what's funny. I was going to say, Rob called it in my first draft of the intro.

77
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,280
Uh, tiger con chat says with Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony doing their own thing. They don't

78
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,200
need E3 anymore. Well, it's interesting. And you know, Bobby went in the current iteration

79
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,160
of E3 is garbage anyway. Yeah. Bobby went in depth on this, on his show, a little bit

80
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,600
talking about kind of like the industry basically has no trade show right now because you know,

81
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,040
the consumers, uh, demanded to be led into the trade show. Um, and I thought he made

82
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,240
some very good points and kind of ended up on an aha moment towards the end of the show.

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:38,720
Like when, when did E3 really start to shit the bed? I don't know how else to put it.

84
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,440
And I honestly, a lot of it is on, and I, I really put most of the blame at the feet

85
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,960
of the ESA. And I, again, I've been saying this for a long time. This one's a little

86
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,080
more of a hot take, take it or leave it. The ESA is an archaic organization that is

87
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,400
not doing no good for this industry right now. And I don't know why the ESA is still

88
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,080
in business, quite frankly. Uh, when Sony backed out of E3, that should have been the

89
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,520
beginning of the end for the ESA. I kind of think it was, I think they're just dying a

90
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,560
much slower death. Um, and I think is, is that in any industry innovation is, is difficult.

91
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,840
Anything that changes what people are used to is, well, I mean, people are slow to slow

92
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,420
to change and, and I don't disagree. However, this is the fucking tech industry and I would

93
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,480
expect the ESA to be innovating and you, you're, you're, you're right in that they don't. And

94
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,360
that's why they're, they're a failure. And that's why they got hacked all those times

95
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,420
that they did, because they can't even live up to the security that they're preaching

96
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,980
other people to follow. Like the ESA is a joke. Like, and so I, for one will not miss

97
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,860
E3, rest in piss. Bye. And I think, you know, we got into a lot of it a couple of weeks

98
00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:00,620
ago about how a lot of what E3 kind of stood for 20 years ago, doesn't hold up anymore.

99
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,780
This industry had a lot of growing up to do, still has some growing up to do, but it's

100
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,460
grown up a little bit. You know, I think we can look that there has been progress made

101
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,480
in the last 20 years. And I don't think the show of 20 years ago is going to hold up anymore.

102
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,100
So I think the E3 that all of you remember being televised on G4, which was that point

103
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,660
that we kind of hit on at the end of Bobby show where, uh, when they started televising

104
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:35,340
E3 on G4, it turned up that FOMO dial to 11. What other trade show was televised on TV

105
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,220
24 seven.

106
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,580
Which it didn't need to be.

107
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,780
No, it didn't. And the ESA shouldn't have allowed it.

108
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:50,140
That was the failure. So they, well, the whole thing is that I think if we open this up to

109
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:57,240
some of the public, right, then this is going to put more money in our pockets with, with

110
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:04,180
losing sight of what the purpose of the show is for. Now, I mean, when, when I was going,

111
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:11,060
it was under the DDR freak umbrella, but I also took the opportunities to, to try to

112
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,820
network, you know, I mean, that's when I went to a GDC, that's what I was doing was networking

113
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,460
with people.

114
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,180
I I'm, I'm going to say something I'm probably going to regret saying, but I'm going to say

115
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,300
it anyway. You know me, um, I well, and I've also grown up and my perspectives have changed

116
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,300
over the last few years and I reserve the right to change my opinions because sometimes

117
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,100
I learn new things that changed my opinions. And so what I'm going to say in the context

118
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:41,060
of that is, number one, I don't think E3 should ever come back. We should have a trade show.

119
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:48,060
Yes, but I don't think the ESA, it shouldn't be the ESA's thing because the ESA is incompetent.

120
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,220
But although the name is very clever, just saying E3, you know, I think they should keep

121
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,380
the name and have someone else own it.

122
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,180
If E3 were to come back, I think it should go back to the airport years when it was very

123
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,540
selective on who got in and very selective on what they were showing and how that all

124
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:14,260
went down. Obviously that needs to be, um, tailored a little more. Um, and, uh, but that's,

125
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:20,300
that's what the show, whatever succeeds E3 is probably going to look like, and I'm saying

126
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:27,620
this because people need to get used to this. If they really truly want a trade show, it's

127
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,820
going to look like those years that E3 was at the Long Beach airport. Was that where

128
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,700
it was? I think it was. And that the hotels and all of that. And that was the year that

129
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,140
only what, like two to 3000 people got in. I know semantics, semantics. I know you're

130
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,160
going to say they're under contract to the LA conventions. The ESA shouldn't even doing

131
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,700
it in the first place. Those contracts won't matter. I'm not even saying it needs to be

132
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,740
in LA. Um, I think you either go to a different name in the ESA, is it running it then that

133
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,580
contract doesn't apply. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so I, it'll be interesting to see what comes

134
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:08,480
of the whole thing. Um, Bobby is in chat saying my favorite E3 was E3 2008, which was limited

135
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,560
attendance like the airport years, but still at LA convention center. E3 2007 was the one

136
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,780
in Santa Monica, but they ran a small E3 at the LA convention center and that was better

137
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,520
than the, uh, than the spread out stuff in the airport hangar. That sounds a lot like

138
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,460
a logistic thing where like just being all spread out all over Long Beach was probably

139
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,900
a pain in the butt. Having it all at the LA convention center was probably just a lot

140
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,020
more convenient. And I, I that's, that's a logistics thing. And you know, that's up to

141
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:40,740
whatever E3 successor, if there is one ends up being. So, um, we'll see. Now, the fall

142
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,760
was really just getting rid of Kenshi Hall. I'm kidding. Um, I didn't even really get

143
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:52,380
into the specifics of the story. Um, the news broke from a tweet from Razor PR lead

144
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,980
Will Powers, um, who said that they had sent out an email announcing the cancellation of

145
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,980
a digital E3 event. Well, if you're going to have an E3 where you actually want to keep

146
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,840
secrets that don't get out to the internet, now you know how, who not to invite. No, he,

147
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,300
he didn't do anything wrong. Um, but I was just thinking about how there are other trade

148
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,260
shows. Like the movie industry has a trade show where they show new movies to cinema

149
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:26,220
or new trailers anyway, to a cinema chain owners and people that own movie theaters.

150
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,020
And those trailers don't leak out because there's still a lot of NDAs and non-disclosure

151
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,160
agreements that go in line with those. I'll be interested to see what sort of non-disclosures

152
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,980
agreements, whatever EA successor gets into. There were always NDAs at E3, by the way,

153
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,260
just not the stuff that was out there on the show floor, but everything you were seeing

154
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,560
upstairs in the conference room, I would say 90% of that was under non-disclosure agreements

155
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,520
because they were showing things that weren't going to be announced for a little while.

156
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,580
So ends up in some of the rooms that would say no, no video, no photography. And then

157
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:04,540
there would be some that would be like, you know, they would have specific material or

158
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:13,640
copies of the demo to give out that didn't have like anything of worth on it. Like more

159
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,300
like a press kit on a CD in the later times.

160
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,340
By the way, I'm going back to the story and I'm looking at the guy's Twitter and it says

161
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,620
in his bio, he's a reality TV winner. Wasn't this the guy that won the tester? I'm almost

162
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,300
positive it was.

163
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
What's his name?

164
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,760
Will Powers. Didn't he win like the first or second season of the tester?

165
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,880
I was like a raptor, but I don't know that guy didn't win. He was on it. Sure. He did

166
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,200
not win. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's I'm I just, am I the only one that sees the humor

167
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
in that?

168
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:54,040
I never watched. I never watched the use our Google food. So this is the tester winner.

169
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,200
That was the only one. I think there's only one. No, there's a few seasons because the

170
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,360
gay guy won one of the seasons. Oh, really? And then

171
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
I wonder why it fails.

172
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,560
Cyrus on season one.

173
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,480
Yeah. Bobby's saying Wiki doesn't even give their real names. I'm I'm telling you, it's

174
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,760
the guy that won the tester.

175
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,840
Season two was gamer. G A Y M E R. Okay. Cesar three was

176
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,520
Mike. Mike Deff's agrees with me.

177
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,020
Achilles might.

178
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:28,120
Mike Deff agrees with me. Will Powers won season one. Yes. Okay. And Bobby says, yes,

179
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,960
Cyrus was Will Powers. Okay, thank you. All right. Now, I'm glad I'm just I'm just surprised

180
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,840
that's not in the bio here on the news article.

181
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,400
Yep, that's it.

182
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,880
Okay. Oh, Mike Deff brought the receipts from a PlayStation blog. That's funny.

183
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Yeah, I see that.

184
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
It was also an Engadget article.

185
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,440
Well, good for him. He's living out his dream being in the industry and and providing breaking

186
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,720
breaking news. Good for him. I'm not I'm not being shady at all.

187
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,200
I'll never invite him back.

188
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Well, it was just one of those things where I was like, wait a minute. Why I can't shake

189
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:11,080
this feeling. All right. Anyway, um, the ESA did confirm in an official statement that

190
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:19,120
E3 2022 is canceled. However, they say in the follow up, E3 will return in 2023 with

191
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,720
a reinvigorated showcase.

192
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,920
So that's we're saying so as much as I'm sitting here celebrating the death of E3 because

193
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,840
I think that's a line. I don't think it is coming back in 2023. We'll see. Yeah, no,

194
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
I you know,

195
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,180
it means they haven't made a decision to cancel it for good. That's all. Yeah.

196
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:48,920
So yeah, here's the entire statement from the ESA. E3 will return in 2023 with a reinvigorated

197
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,180
showcase that celebrates new and exciting video games and industry innovations. We previously

198
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,480
announced that E3 would not be held in person in 2022 due to the ongoing health risks that

199
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
surrounding COVID-19.

200
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,180
Oh, that's true.

201
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:10,680
Well, I'm it's a cop out. It's escaped out. Like I'm not I'm not saying it's not true.

202
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,600
But I'm saying compared to literally the rest of the world and how everything is functioning

203
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,140
at other trade shows. And so in fact that like people are not canceling anything because

204
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:26,740
COVID anymore. And I just got back from Las Vegas, where I was maybe in the 3% of people

205
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:37,060
that were wearing masks in casinos, like COVID-19 is a convenient excuse for the ESA. And I

206
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:43,180
I know that's not the the the PC thing to say. But it's absolutely correct. And I think

207
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:49,740
COVID-19 was the convenient excuse for the ESA last year to to be quite honest,

208
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,940
should be a valid excuse. People aren't really treating it as one.

209
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,740
Correct.

210
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,280
It is but they could take precautions and stuff, especially that would be your perfect time to

211
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,980
lower the attendance is to, you know, okay, we'll have people in person, but we're only going to do

212
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,940
like a quarter of the attendees due to COVID or something, but they didn't even do that. They

213
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,540
just said, oh, we're not doing it.

214
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,540
Fucking brilliant. Loki. Honestly, the best thing the ESA probably could have done was to have it

215
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:21,100
anyway, vaccine masks, and you know what, we're not going to have the consumers this year, we're

216
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,100
not going to we're going to cut all these people out because of COVID.

217
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,580
Your perfect scapegoat right there, you know, you could just

218
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,220
that would have been to what it was that would have been the better scapegoat.

219
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:41,420
But that's not why so you know that that's why they're, you know, doing what they're doing.

220
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:47,260
Anyway, continuing with the statement. Today, we announced there will also be no digital E3

221
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,540
showcase in 2022. See, COVID doesn't stop that.

222
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,140
Well, that's because of digital COVID. Haven't you heard? It's the new variant that goes over the

223
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,540
internet.

224
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,980
Ah, yes, the computer will get COVID.

225
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,420
Yes, we can't expose our people.

226
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,300
Yes, the computer virus that exposes personal information. Yes.

227
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,260
And then the variant Corvid where you you know, poop crows.

228
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,980
The metaverse COVID.

229
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,780
MetaVid.

230
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:19,620
Instead, we will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and

231
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,620
digital E3 experience next summer.

232
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,820
Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the

233
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,620
community, media and industry back together in an all new format and interactive experience.

234
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,460
Bullshit, but I'm going to tell you why it's bullshit.

235
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,420
If the ESA wants me to believe that because right now I don't and I've given you a damn good list of

236
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,580
reasons why I don't.

237
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,940
They would have already said, who's on board with that 2023 vision?

238
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,980
Who have you gotten to agree to this 2023 show?

239
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,740
Who are your partners in this?

240
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,020
You don't got any.

241
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,300
You're trying to sell snake oil right now, ESA.

242
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,020
You're selling a vision.

243
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,940
Why don't you go to Kickstarter?

244
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,540
And the Phantom.

245
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,660
And the Phantom.

246
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,860
Wasn't the Phantom there one time?

247
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,420
I swear to God, I played the Phantom.

248
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
It was, yeah.

249
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
I think we saw the Phantom, yeah.

250
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,700
It was real, sort of.

251
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,820
All right.

252
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,060
For like a minute.

253
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,780
What was in the box?

254
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,780
We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023.

255
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,540
That part they have to say because of the contract with the convention center.

256
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,820
Look for more news and announcements soon.

257
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,220
So that's, that's the one thing you can count on.

258
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,660
The ESA, if they don't end up just throwing it in the trash, they're going to have this

259
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,340
convention at the LA convention center because they have to.

260
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,540
So, I mean, that doesn't mean it won't be like one room.

261
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,260
Not it'll, it might be the size of drag con.

262
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,140
It might just be one little hall, but it might, it'll still happen at the LA convention center.

263
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,220
There's a line from MST3K that's popping through my head right now.

264
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,500
Whoopty shit.

265
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,860
I just think what it is, is it, it, I think you have a lot of these companies, I would

266
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:08,860
imagine, they're looking to cut costs, throwing a big press event with booths and stuff like

267
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:15,060
that, doesn't really do much more than showcasing their footage and stuff in their own

268
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,340
controlled environment where they have all the attention.

269
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,620
Like, I just say, it's like, I can put on a presentation for a few thousand dollars, or I

270
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,340
could rent out a booth space for a few million dollars.

271
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,220
What would I rather do?

272
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,940
And then this way, you also don't have to like, push your dev teams to put out demos and

273
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,580
stuff like that, to build a demo for E3.

274
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,620
Like, it just makes more sense not to do it anymore.

275
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,660
Yeah, um, I mean, there's a lot to be said, though, about some of the elements of the

276
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,860
trade show, like the networking and, you know, connecting and sharing ideas and so forth.

277
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:56,340
But yeah, the industry has kind of gotten to this interesting place where they're, they're

278
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,980
putting so much of it just out on the internet at once.

279
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,500
It's like, there's no secrets in this industry anymore when it comes to working with other

280
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:04,940
people.

281
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,100
I don't know, it's weird.

282
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:13,260
Anyway, one thing that a lot of people are turning to is Summer Game Fest.

283
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,100
And so a lot of people are already declaring Summer Game Fest, the new E3.

284
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,500
It's way too early to be doing that, because Summer Game Fest is not a trade show.

285
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,420
Summer Game Fest is a summer version of the game awards that happened in December.

286
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,500
That is what Summer Game Fest is thus far.

287
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,060
Not, not word for word, not page for page.

288
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,620
But it's a very, they come from the same playbook.

289
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,500
So Jeff Keeley did conveniently timing share some more information about Summer Game Fest.

290
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,460
He said, yes, it's taking place this year.

291
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,100
Yes, it's going to occur in June.

292
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,380
Yes, there's going to be a live kickoff show at the start of the event.

293
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,820
And the presentation will have new announcements and first looks at various gaming properties.

294
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,300
The official website, of course, will have all the details in the coming weeks.

295
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,020
Jeff Keeley also had a very interesting timed tweet with everything that was going on with

296
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,500
E3.

297
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,220
I got to pull it up now because of course, I don't have it in front of me.

298
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,580
But he said something very tongue in cheek, and he kind of had to go back and clarify

299
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:18,420
it that like, I'm not trying to shade E3, but like the tweet read is like, kind of shady.

300
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,860
I wonder if he still has it up or if he ended up deleting it.

301
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,500
Of course, I'm sure the chat is already on it.

302
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,220
But I'm trying to bring it up for myself here.

303
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,900
Let's see.

304
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:30,900
Huh.

305
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,460
My bad.

306
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,820
I'll bring it up for myself here.

307
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,820
Let's see.

308
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,700
March 31st.

309
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,660
It was a day.

310
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,420
Oh, he just tweeted a winky face.

311
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,620
That's a lot of people thought that was a winky face emote was you shady bitch pretty

312
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,100
much.

313
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,900
I guess you can read a lot into a winky face emote.

314
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,380
I don't know.

315
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,540
But anyway, Summer Game Fest.

316
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,340
It's coming back.

317
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,620
We'll see.

318
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,260
We'll see how it goes and what they all have.

319
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,300
But it's not a trade show.

320
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,820
There might be a keynote that happens in person or something like that, but it's not going

321
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,060
to be exactly the same thing as E3.

322
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:17,060
It looks like the June gaming event season, which I don't even know if we call it E3 anymore.

323
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
I don't think we shouldn't be calling it E3 anymore.

324
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:26,500
The June media season in gaming will probably be a Nintendo Direct.

325
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,140
That's also another interesting question to ask.

326
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,900
Nintendo is off the hook to do an E3 direct.

327
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,660
Will they still do one in June?

328
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,140
I don't see why they wouldn't.

329
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:45,940
But if Nintendo decided to do a summer direct in July, y'all can't say shit because there's

330
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,300
no E3 to time it with.

331
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,420
So I wonder if that might get delayed.

332
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:50,900
We'll see.

333
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,260
I just wonder if we're still going to see game companies kind of coalesce around doing

334
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,620
announcements in June or if it's just going to be all over the place.

335
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,780
Tiger Claw on chat says they'll probably do a direct but not call it E3 or something.

336
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,540
Did they call it E3 last year?

337
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,940
I don't remember if they did.

338
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,540
Pele Jarumeo says they did not.

339
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:17,940
Thank you.

340
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:25,140
Pele Jarumeo says just like tech killed newspapers, E3 is a victim of changing media habits and

341
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,780
tech.

342
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,740
That's why the fan centric cons will still flourish.

343
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,020
Oh, absolutely.

344
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,660
This has nothing to do with fan cons.

345
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,820
And ironically, the consumer expos, this has nothing to do with them.

346
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:44,660
And this that you're right, they will continue to flourish as people are feeling the pain

347
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,500
of the last two years.

348
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,700
And even if it's probably not the best idea to be going out and doing these things, people

349
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,300
are going to go out and do these things.

350
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,940
We can at least hope conventions will be smart and at least have precautions because

351
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,020
precautions, you know, and Bobby said this earlier, there is no convention that has been

352
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,340
declared a super spreader or no gaming convention.

353
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,060
I know of that's been declared a super spreader event yet because they're all mandating

354
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,100
precautions.

355
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:16,260
Everyone I've been to is mask and VAX or negative test in 48 hours or whatever it is,

356
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,460
whatever it was for Dragon Con.

357
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,820
And following those precautions go an awful long way in stopping super spreader types

358
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,300
of things.

359
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,780
So interesting.

360
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,500
Bobby Blackwell says, I just checked a super spreader database.

361
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,300
Not a single convention was on the list as a super spreader event.

362
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,980
Lots of weddings and nursing homes, though.

363
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,900
I thought early on in the pandemic, there was ironically a science convention that was

364
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,500
one of the first super spreader events.

365
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,100
So and that obviously nobody knew anything then.

366
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,660
So I'm not saying it's a fault of that convention, but I worry about that database you're looking

367
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,500
at because if it doesn't list that one, a biotech or something like that was one of

368
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,020
the early, early, early conventions in the science industry that had it.

369
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,220
So Mike Deff says, I went to a convention yesterday and most people were masked, even

370
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,260
if it was an outside event.

371
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,900
SSU100Matt says the Sturgis Bike Festival was a super spreader event.

372
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:13,220
Well, the people there simply did not believe in COVID.

373
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,820
And that wasn't a convention to be that also.

374
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,100
That was a very different.

375
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,820
That was a festival semantics, I know.

376
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,860
But it it would fall in a different category.

377
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,820
So isn't that the one that Smash Mouth played and gotten a lot of shit for?

378
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,940
I think it was.

379
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,300
Anyway, I think I think I think it was because I remember the parodies that were like, hey,

380
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,740
now you've got COVID.

381
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,940
Get your cough on.

382
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,660
Hey, now.

383
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:38,900
All right.

384
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,660
Anyway, we shouldn't joke about it, but I do.

385
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,460
I have to tell jokes when people have to have that gallows humor when you when people are

386
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,300
willfully ignorant about it.

387
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,820
I have to joke about that.

388
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,460
So please understand the difference.

389
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,500
All right.

390
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,860
Anyhow, so E3 canceled back next year.

391
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,500
Summer Game Fest still happening, although we don't know the specifics of what that looked

392
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:04,900
like.

393
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,700
But it will be interesting to see if Jeff Keighley tries to corral the horses because

394
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,420
he does.

395
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,580
He does have a good relationship with Nintendo.

396
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,740
He does have a good relationship with a lot of partners.

397
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:19,300
It will be interesting to see if he does corral the horses to get everybody to still

398
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,620
make their announcements around that same time.

399
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,180
I just think what Jeff Keighley needs to do don't have Summer Game Fest as a three month

400
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,500
event.

401
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,340
That was silly.

402
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,420
That lowers the impact of it.

403
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,620
You need to corral that to two weeks tops.

404
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,060
I mean, if people want to do announcements outside of that, fine.

405
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,500
But that's not Summer Game Fest.

406
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,940
So just something I think Jeff needs to work on in that whole regard is Summer Game Fest

407
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,060
is not a three month event.

408
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,700
Give me a break.

409
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,820
That's just summer in the games industry.

410
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,700
So yeah, Dr.

411
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,780
Sia says, I mean, if he can do it for the game awards and he has no competition this

412
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,620
year, this is the year to do it.

413
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:04,980
This is the if Jeff wants to attack the ESA's weak point for massive damage and considering

414
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,660
he backed out of E3 before it was officially gone, he may have a bone to pick with them

415
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,300
allegedly.

416
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:16,260
I don't know anything, but there are interesting signs that line up that show that Jeff Keighley

417
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,580
may have a little bit of personal interest in attacking the weak point of E3 for massive

418
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,300
damage here.

419
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:28,980
I don't know, but I know why we're here to announce Keighley 3 coming soon this summer.

420
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,060
I don't know about y'all, but spite is a big motivator for me.

421
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:39,140
And if I'm Jeff Keighley and I may or may not allegedly have some spite in my back pocket,

422
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,420
let that do the motivating.

423
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,820
Godspeed, Jeff Keighley, our Canadian friend.

424
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,320
All right.

425
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,380
By the way, Rob, I think I found my E3 2006 photos.

426
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,340
I have one of those two.

427
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,940
There's one of you and I sitting on the ground in the media room somewhere that keeps popping

428
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,900
up and that one.

429
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,460
But these are hold on.

430
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,020
They need to be super rotated.

431
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,300
I don't know how they got this way.

432
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,060
Okay, never mind.

433
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,460
That's the Winchester Mystery House, but I have a couple.

434
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,700
So because it was in May that year.

435
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,100
So I'll have to see if I can find them.

436
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,540
They got to be spread out amongst these, but I did find the one of you and me.

437
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,820
Vognetwork.com slash discord to so young.

438
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,500
I know what happened.

439
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,560
All right.

440
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,940
Enough about E3.

441
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,380
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things that we have been playing

442
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,020
this week.

443
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,780
So Dark Sakura, I'll start with you.

444
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,660
How was your gaming week?

445
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,780
Um, it's been pretty eventful.

446
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:47,300
I'm still playing through Seiken Densetsu 3 or as it was called Trials of Mana.

447
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:55,140
I'm also, of course, still doing Dead by Daylight, which I'm having a lot of fun with.

448
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,260
I found a picture of Evan.

449
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,860
I'm sorry.

450
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:04,900
Anyway, I'm also still playing my silly little wordscapes game and I've been enjoying

451
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,700
watching other people play Elden Ring, so I don't have to.

452
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,900
We also have the Indianapolis 500 pinball now, and there's been a little bit of play

453
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,020
that going on in my house.

454
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,580
Oh, that's fun.

455
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,700
Yeah, not too bad.

456
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:21,780
All right.

457
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,740
That's about it.

458
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,540
Loki, we'll go to you.

459
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,340
How was your gaming week?

460
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:34,820
Uh, well, I played Minecraft still, and I also did finally boot up my DR machine to

461
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,940
set it up for the kids to play, and then they were doing something else, so I decided to

462
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,900
play it a little bit, so I need to get back into that.

463
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,860
At least it still works.

464
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,980
Yeah, and that's it?

465
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,260
That's it.

466
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,660
Yeah.

467
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,300
You know Minecraft and usually something else.

468
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:53,700
All right.

469
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,340
I found them.

470
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,340
E3 2005.

471
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:57,780
Get it.

472
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,140
Put them in our Discord server or something.

473
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,060
I bet folks would like to see with the boomerang controller for the PS3.

474
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,180
Oh, God.

475
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,340
That's a throwback.

476
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,980
All right.

477
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,180
Get ready, Discord.

478
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,180
Maybe do like one or two a day this week.

479
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,500
Don't throw 30 pictures in there at once.

480
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,300
I'll forget.

481
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:15,620
All right.

482
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,700
I'll do a group of them.

483
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,220
Let's see.

484
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,020
My gaming week.

485
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,620
So I ended up not playing a lot this week because I've been in Vegas for the past few

486
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,220
days, so we went to Las Vegas on Wednesday and just got back yesterday.

487
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,060
We flew back Saturday because it was cheaper flights, but while we were in Vegas, we went

488
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:37,460
to the Pinball Museum Hall of Fame, and it's in a new place now than the last time I went.

489
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,980
It used to be in that strip mall that was a little ways away from the strip.

490
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,300
Now it is literally at the start of the strip.

491
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:43,940
They moved it.

492
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,940
It's right where the famous sign that says, Welcome to Vegas is at the very start of the

493
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,440
strip.

494
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,420
Kind of it's honest.

495
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,700
Okay, let me put it in perspective.

496
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,140
In Pikmin, when I hit my little radar thing at the Pinball Hall of Fame, I got airport

497
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,620
Pikmin because it's literally right there.

498
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,060
Could be near the Liberace Museum, remember?

499
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,100
Where was the Liberace Museum?

500
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,740
That was-

501
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,620
I don't remember.

502
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,820
I just remember that we passed the Liberace Museum when Tiara took me.

503
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:20,100
I know that you can't miss this place because they've painted the word pinball in gigantic

504
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,780
letters, and I think they did it because the airport is right there.

505
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,820
You can see it as you're actually landing at the airport, which is pretty funny, and

506
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,460
that's a very funny way to advertise.

507
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,300
They also have their own fancy new neon sign that looks like the Vegas sign.

508
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,700
So they're making money or something or got a good grant or something because they've

509
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,980
really upped the place.

510
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,420
It's a much bigger space and they have more stuff in there.

511
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,980
They have a lot of broken stuff, but they had that before.

512
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,260
I'm not really holding that against them because they have a lot of great working stuff.

513
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,140
So I saw a crap ton of pinball tables.

514
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,860
I more watched Alan play.

515
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,140
I didn't play a lot myself.

516
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,020
I played the Tron arcade machine they had there because I had to.

517
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:06,900
I played a Nightmare on Elm Street pinball table, which I forgot existed, and I enjoyed

518
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,140
it.

519
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,740
So I was like, this is fun.

520
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,700
Was that wasn't it like a Gottlieb one?

521
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,900
I think it is a Gottlieb table.

522
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,300
Yeah, I have a picture of it somewhere because I put it on Instagram.

523
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,700
The Gottlieb ones are hit and miss.

524
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,060
It was fun, but it's really easy.

525
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,900
I don't know if it was tuned that way, but basically I won a free game and Alan won a

526
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,460
free game.

527
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,420
So it was very easy.

528
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,780
Um, and then I watched.

529
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,020
This is a funny thing, and you'll get a kick out of this dark soccer.

530
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,180
I watched Alan drop like $4 into Elvira scared stiff.

531
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,220
And I was like, why don't you just go to dark soccer's house?

532
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,420
Or well, I know you don't have it anymore.

533
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:40,980
We gave it back.

534
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,060
I know, but I was like, why don't you just go over there and play it?

535
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,740
But he was like, I'm here and it's right in front of me and damn it, I'm going to play

536
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:46,900
it.

537
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,380
I'm like, all right, I'm not going to tell you what to do.

538
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,340
Like I can play Tron.

539
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,300
I'm not faulting that.

540
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,700
Yeah.

541
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,660
So, um, and I watched him play some other stuff too.

542
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,620
I watched him play that, uh, circus volitaire.

543
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,660
It's a fun machine.

544
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,060
Voltaire.

545
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,700
That's it.

546
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,580
Uh, that's a fun machine.

547
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,700
I'm trying to remember what else I played.

548
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,580
Oh, Arabian nights.

549
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,220
I love that table.

550
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,020
I have to play that.

551
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,940
That was also a Papa Duke table.

552
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,900
The guy who did a theater and a world cup.

553
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:10,920
Got it.

554
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,940
Um, Bobby Blackwell says the Liberace museum was North and East of the airport.

555
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,140
The pinball hall of fame is on the Western edge of the airport.

556
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,380
It's right next door to the Harley Davidson thing.

557
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,060
I do know that too.

558
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,460
I don't know.

559
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,460
I don't know if that rings a bell at all.

560
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,500
I don't know what it was before.

561
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,300
Good Kingdom Hearts.

562
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,580
Um, sorry.

563
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,940
Oh, E3 pictures.

564
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,740
Um, let's see.

565
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,700
I'm trying to think of what other pinball tables I like play.

566
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,180
They have a lot of old arcade machines too, which is cool.

567
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,540
I just had a good time.

568
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,020
So, and it's funny because somebody was asking me, so I missed a friend of mine that used

569
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,900
to listen to this show.

570
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,020
I don't know if he still does.

571
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,260
Hi.

572
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,780
You know who you are if you're listening, but he messaged me on Instagram and he's like,

573
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,460
I'm going to Vegas this weekend.

574
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,180
Great.

575
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,060
When do you get here?

576
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,020
He was like getting there like two hours after my flight took off on Saturday.

577
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,940
I'm like, how convenient.

578
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,420
So I was like, all right.

579
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,500
Well, he said, where are the DDR machines?

580
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,420
And I'm like, I have to be honest.

581
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,580
I kind of stopped like scoping where DDR machines were a long time ago.

582
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,180
I'm sure some of the casinos have them, but I don't really scope out the arcades, the

583
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,900
casinos anymore.

584
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,620
I said, but the pinball hall of fame has a DDR X cause I just saw that.

585
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,820
So go there.

586
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,660
And I just think the pinball hall of fame is a good stop for any gamer.

587
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,540
Even if you feel kind of met on pinball, I would ask a, why are you met on pinball when

588
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,100
you like other, I think pinball is great, but whatever.

589
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,140
And they have a good collection of retro arcade games too.

590
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,780
And they have like weird shit that used to be in seventies and eighties arcades.

591
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,100
Do you remember that machine that would make wax Donald Duck figures?

592
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,700
I think I made one with Melody when I went there with her, there was maybe dark soccer

593
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,660
saw it when she was there.

594
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,020
But they have one for Pluto now next to it.

595
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,660
And I was like, wow, that's a blast from the past.

596
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,460
So there's that.

597
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,420
And a pod culture and chat is bringing up.

598
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,940
Rob teased me by messaging me a pic of the doctor who pinball table.

599
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,060
Yes, I did.

600
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,780
I did.

601
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:11,780
I wanted to play the rush pinball table, but some guy was on it like nonstop because I

602
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,980
know it's the hot new shit.

603
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,340
Somebody was on it nonstop.

604
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,940
So I was like, all right, I'll just play it when I visit Bobby Black Wolf later this year

605
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,420
for Dragon Con 2022.

606
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,140
So we'll see.

607
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:27,300
So dark to see it says I did play the Tron pinball when I was there.

608
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,820
I did not see the Tron pinball or I would have played that too.

609
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,500
Yeah, the pinball is good.

610
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,660
I love what they did with the ramps in that game.

611
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,340
But yeah, I didn't see it.

612
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,620
You've got the deluxe that is.

613
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,700
Yeah, it might have been out of commission.

614
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,060
And that's why I didn't notice it.

615
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,060
They did have a lot of pinball games are out of commission.

616
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,420
So we'll see.

617
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,100
Anyway, so yeah, the bulk of my gaming week was being in Vegas.

618
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,300
I'm going to say off topic.

619
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,860
I just have to say I saw two shows while I was in Vegas.

620
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,260
I saw Drag Race Live and all I'm going to say about it.

621
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,460
It wasn't that good.

622
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,140
Like it was I felt like it was false advertising to of the eight girls on the poster.

623
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,140
Two of them were in the show I saw that night.

624
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,580
And then they had, I think, understudies because it was Alexis Mateo and Kahana Montrese, which

625
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,220
both are great.

626
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,340
Don't get me wrong.

627
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,860
But it was a little like, oh, I thought we were going to be seeing these other girls.

628
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,340
All right.

629
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:16,740
Okay.

630
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,980
I mean, but the whole thing is super cheesy.

631
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,580
Anyway, I know some of you roll your eyes in the back of your head when I talk about

632
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:22,980
Drag Race.

633
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,860
That's all I'll say about it.

634
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,660
It was silly.

635
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,780
I think it would have I would have probably had a better time if I went to the real drag

636
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:27,940
show.

637
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,260
They have it.

638
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,060
Send your frogs.

639
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,780
I should have done that.

640
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,860
But the other show I went and saw, I went and saw Dionne Warwick on Thursday night.

641
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,420
Now y'all know I will hold her for.

642
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,060
Yeah, exactly.

643
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,820
I hope y'all know Dionne Warwick.

644
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,860
That's what friends are for.

645
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,780
And psychic.

646
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:49,540
Alfie, do you know the way to San Jose, her psychic friends commercials back in the day,

647
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,980
or the fact that she's the queen of Twitter now.

648
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,260
She has a great Twitter account.

649
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,700
And she was a Vegas legend for many years.

650
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:05,140
And she ran in the same circles with many of those Vegas legends you hear a lot about.

651
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,580
This place that I saw her at, I had no idea where this place was when I bought the tickets.

652
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,300
They were expensive, but they weren't that expensive because we did get the cheap seats.

653
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,660
But that room was maybe 250 people tops.

654
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,180
The Lyft driver gets to the venue.

655
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,460
There's a security guard at the gate who says, What are you here for?

656
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,020
And I'm like, isn't this is the Dionne Warwick concert here?

657
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,540
And they're like, Yep, go on in.

658
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,940
It's like I had to know the password to get into this place.

659
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,060
And then like the place was just itty bitty.

660
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,300
It was like seeing it in a wedding hall or a wedding reception room.

661
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,140
That's basically where I saw Dionne Warwick.

662
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,540
I haven't been to a concert that small since I saw Alanis Morissette perform at a library

663
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,380
in Big Sur.

664
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:57,780
So that right there was a pleasure, a treat, a once in a lifetime experience because Dionne

665
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,620
Warwick is a living legend.

666
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,540
If you don't know her, Google her, look her up, educate yourself because she's fabulous.

667
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,740
And the fact that I got to see her in such a small venue.

668
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:13,060
I'm like, Oh, and by the way, Alan and I, by far the youngest people in that room, by

669
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,900
far the youngest people in that room.

670
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,180
The other people sitting at the table with us.

671
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,700
The lady was super nice.

672
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
She was like, Yeah, I just retired.

673
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,580
I worked at the Vegas Convention Center and I just retired.

674
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,580
And let me tell you about all these things in Vegas.

675
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,060
She enjoyed hearing our story.

676
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,900
She was just a spunky older.

677
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,380
I'm not gonna say old lady, older lady.

678
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,980
Lady in her prime.

679
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:42,100
Yeah, so and yes, Misha also brings up for those that don't know, she's Whitney Houston's

680
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,500
cousin.

681
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,900
Yes, she's related to Whitney Houston as well.

682
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,060
I think Dionne Warwick is a legend in her own right.

683
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,020
But of course, we love legends related to legends, of course.

684
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,780
So anyway, so it was the whole thing was absolutely worth it for the Dionne Warwick show 100%.

685
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,660
And if you're going to be in Vegas when she's performing, I urge you to do it.

686
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,020
But you might want to dress nicer than Alan and I did.

687
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,180
Because the Vegas thing said it was casual.

688
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,660
And I wore I wore like a nice little polo shirt and some jeans.

689
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,100
So it was like what I might wear to work.

690
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,620
But I get there and people are like full on in suits and ties.

691
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,140
Boomer casual.

692
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,820
Yeah, you have to.

693
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,340
Yes, you have to go boomer casual.

694
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,420
Anyway, no regrets.

695
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,620
I had a great time at the show.

696
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,020
Just like you're going on a Pan Am flight.

697
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,660
Tiger class says no, I get it.

698
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,260
Back in the day when people used to dress up to fly.

699
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,620
Tiger class says sounds like the place was filled with old people who grew up on Dionne

700
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,740
Warwick, that part.

701
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,060
Or people who knew people who were old and grew up on Dionne Warwick.

702
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,260
So they heard a lot of it in, you know, so that's that's where I come in, I think.

703
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:57,620
And I just, you know, there's certain pictures of Rob and Matt, when you're gay, there's

704
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,980
certain divas you're going to hear about Dionne Warwick's one of them.

705
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,780
She might not be the one you hear about the most, but she's definitely one you're going

706
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,340
to hear about.

707
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:10,340
So anyway, sorry to delve into non-gaming stuff, but I had to get that off my chest

708
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,940
because again, that was a once in a lifetime show and I was just very giddy to get to do

709
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,260
that.

710
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,860
So there's that.

711
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:20,500
So all right, let's get back into video games and some actual headlines and stories.

712
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,180
Hey Rob.

713
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:22,680
What?

714
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,620
I found pictures of you and Matt.

715
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,740
I'm sure there's a lot of pictures of me and Matt.

716
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,660
If you just hit print screen, you'll get one right now.

717
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,620
When we recorded our podcast for at E3 2005.

718
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,020
Oh, we didn't really do it at E3.

719
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,900
Oh no, did we?

720
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,100
We did it in the hotel room.

721
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,300
Oh yeah, in the hotel room.

722
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:43,700
We did.

723
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

724
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,580
I would say we might have done one in the media room, but yeah, it was the, which is,

725
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,780
you know what?

726
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,820
Does that make us the first, does that make us the first podcast to be done at E3?

727
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,460
Maybe not.

728
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,340
I don't want to stake a claim that's too big.

729
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,940
The first podcast that's still around, probably.

730
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,460
I don't know.

731
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:07,940
I don't know.

732
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,980
We're stubborn that way.

733
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:16,020
Well, keep in mind, most shows didn't start until June 2006 when, uh, podcasting hit iTunes.

734
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,220
So if we did a podcast about video games in 2005.

735
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,800
Yeah.

736
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,240
So anyway.

737
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,520
Oh, Bobby says, Oh, June 2005.

738
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,880
I always get the year wrong.

739
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,200
All right.

740
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,280
Then if it was 2005, nevermind.

741
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,480
If it was 2004.

742
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,560
I found 2006 as pictures just now.

743
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,840
Actually, I take it back.

744
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,800
That's California extreme.

745
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:39,880
All right.

746
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,120
Nope.

747
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,440
It is.

748
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:40,680
Nope.

749
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,240
It's E3.

750
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,880
All right, Jamie, you got to stop yelling about the random pictures.

751
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,160
Just post them in the discord.

752
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,200
Let's get back to the news.

753
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,840
All right.

754
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,000
Uh, Loki, kick us off with some news.

755
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,480
So yeah, we had some good news about Activision.

756
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,960
The good news is we're not talking about their sexual exploitation of their employees.

757
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,440
Um, no, this time we're talking about that headline.

758
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,440
We probably should mention that actually is that there's that settlement, right?

759
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:07,900
Yes.

760
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,280
So they settled.

761
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:10,920
Mm hmm.

762
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,200
Anyways, disclosed 18 million.

763
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,640
I think a drop in the bucket for Bobby Kotick's salary last year.

764
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,000
It's a few minutes.

765
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,120
Um, so apparently they put out a memo to their employees, uh, letting them know that, uh,

766
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,880
effective immediately, they are removing the company's vaccine mandate, meaning whether

767
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:42,600
or not you are, um, vaccinated against COVID-19, you can go ahead and come back in.

768
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:49,080
And because of that, there's already been a new, uh, walkout schedule for April 4th

769
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,840
in response to the office plan.

770
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,480
Good for them.

771
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,240
According to the ABK workers Alliance.

772
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,800
Good for them.

773
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,400
That that is that that that needs to happen more often where they start sticking it loudly

774
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,600
to their bosses.

775
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,080
I do think there is a, um, sort of a footnote with this though that I want to make sure

776
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:11,480
is clear because I believe studios within Activision Blizzard being one of them are

777
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,880
allowed to dictate their own terms on the vaccine theme, because I have seen that Blizzard

778
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,080
specifically is not waving that.

779
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:25,400
So even though an Activision senior put that out there, probably for the, the, the, those

780
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,920
under the Activision umbrella, um, the sub studios do get to make their own call on that.

781
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,040
So I, I think it is an important clarification.

782
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,600
So, um, because that means that like Blizzard would have no reason to participate in this

783
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:43,000
walkout unless, unless there's other things going on that are, that are not a part of

784
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,880
this report, um, that the walkout is going to cover.

785
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,040
Yeah.

786
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,800
They're trying to get everybody back in the office and then they say, we'll pivot if

787
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,280
necessary.

788
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,560
If we see a spike in cases, well, it's too late at that point.

789
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,240
Right.

790
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,320
But we're seeing this everywhere.

791
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,640
This goes back to what I said earlier about E3 using COVID-19 as an excuse.

792
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:07,480
Like literally the end, this is, this is an even better example of the industry going,

793
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,840
nevermind COVID-19 is, is in the past.

794
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,560
We beat it.

795
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,120
We did it.

796
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,560
We, uh, mission accomplished on the big banner.

797
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:15,880
Yep.

798
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,840
Mission accomplished.

799
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,960
I laugh cause I don't know what other emotion to have.

800
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:28,120
Um, but yeah, so, uh, good to the employees though, for, for holding out for what they

801
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,320
believe in with all that.

802
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,840
But, um, this is something that's happening at a lot of workplaces.

803
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,880
You know, I'm very thankful in my day job, they are taking it very slowly.

804
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,960
They're like dipping their toe in the water, uh, with this whole thing.

805
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,280
And they've pretty much said, at least where I'm at, that telework can be a permanent

806
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,800
option outside of necessary meetings and trainings that will be in person.

807
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,520
But we don't even know what those look like yet or when those start.

808
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:02,120
So, um, but there's a lot of workplaces, lot of, I'm sure a lot of people in chat

809
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,360
with stories to share where they're like, Nope, we're all coming back to the office

810
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,480
at least a couple of times a week.

811
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,680
So mission accomplished.

812
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,320
Yeah, we did it.

813
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,640
It's over.

814
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,160
We just have to cross our fingers and toes that as the virus continues to mutate, it

815
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,440
mutates downwards.

816
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,440
That's the ironically, I just got back from Vegas.

817
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,280
So maybe my perspective is that is, we're taking that gamble.

818
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,280
We're going to let it ride that COVID keeps mutating in a downward direction where it

819
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,320
might be more transmissible, but it's, it's less effective.

820
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,840
So let's just hope, you know, when it was after Omicron keeps going that way.

821
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,080
Letting it ride is quite a Vegas take on that.

822
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:42,700
Mm hmm.

823
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,800
Sjo and Hunter Matt says a lot of companies are pushing to get folks back in.

824
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,080
So this is a trend.

825
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,520
My company is pushing folks back in at least a hybrid setup.

826
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,000
It's interesting because there's a lot of talk about like, I know here where we live

827
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,360
in Sacramento, which by the way, our city in the news today, I need to I need to mention

828
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,320
this disgusting, not for a great reason.

829
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:13,240
The latest shooting of the week club, I guess there's another sign that COVID-19 is

830
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,840
apparently a thing of the past because now we're getting back to, you know, our every

831
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,400
other day mass shooting in America headlines.

832
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:19,900
Yeah.

833
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,480
So unfortunately, one happened in Sacramento last night.

834
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,520
Obviously, none of us were there even remotely involved with it.

835
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,200
Nobody I know, and I don't think anybody we know was was involved with it.

836
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,080
However, somebody somebody knows six of them were involved with it and lost their life

837
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,960
last night.

838
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,560
And it sucks.

839
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:43,640
And I sit here and I go, when are we going to do something about it?

840
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,960
But I already know the answer is never.

841
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,840
And I just always repeatedly think of that onion headline.

842
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,680
There is no possible way to stop this from happening asks or says country where this

843
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,200
only thing routinely happens.

844
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:56,520
Whatever.

845
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,240
I totally butchered it.

846
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:57,720
But you know what?

847
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,560
You know what I'm talking about that onion always goes around when these things happen.

848
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:08,520
So anyway, so what was I saying about Sacramento?

849
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,000
I forget.

850
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,500
Oh, yes.

851
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,240
Downtown, like they're actually trying to push people to go back in the office because

852
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,240
the businesses downtown are all hurting because everybody's working from home.

853
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,480
And the real estate's drying up and all that.

854
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,680
So it's it's very interesting to watch to see how this goes.

855
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,400
I feel so bad.

856
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,400
I know what the carbon impact has been like.

857
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,560
I'd be curious on that, too.

858
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,640
What that's look like.

859
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,200
Those poor real estate investors, I swear to God.

860
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,520
I feel so bad for them.

861
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,400
Those poor, those poor, poor billionaire towers, poor things.

862
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,800
Anyway, all right, let's move on.

863
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,680
Let's talk about something from last week.

864
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:57,000
Again, I don't love to talk about rumors here on Orange Lounge Radio, but some of them have

865
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,840
a bit more smoke than others where it indicates there is fire.

866
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,600
And sure enough, when we started last week's show, we talked about the PlayStation Plus

867
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,480
rumors.

868
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,000
What happened this week?

869
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,520
It got confirmed.

870
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:14,120
PlayStation is sort of taking on Game Pass, and a lot of it played out exactly how it

871
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,680
was leaked.

872
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,120
In a note.

873
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:22,360
And ironically, yeah, it's ironically light, like how we kind of predicted to that they

874
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,080
would steal ideas.

875
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,040
Sort of.

876
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,280
Yeah.

877
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,720
So SIE President Jim Ryan on the PlayStation blog said today, we are pleased to share with

878
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,160
you official news about changes coming to our subscription services.

879
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,200
I love that official news about the change.

880
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,040
The way that's phrased is actually kind of great.

881
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,400
This June, we're bringing together PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now in an all new PlayStation

882
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,320
Plus subscription service that provides more choice to customers across three membership

883
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,680
tiers globally.

884
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,760
So there's PlayStation Plus essential.

885
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:58,680
What you have today, $9.99 a month or 60 bucks a year, online multiplayer, two free games

886
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,200
a month, exclusive discounts and cloud storage.

887
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,000
Yeah, they did slightly cut that corner, didn't they?

888
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,720
But I think haven't they been on two or were they on three?

889
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,640
I don't know.

890
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,880
It's it's pitiful.

891
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:21,160
Well, to be fair, a lot of the games that they've offered have been kind of silly anyway.

892
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,840
Like what was what was the one?

893
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:27,400
It was the one that was a launch game for the PS5 Godfall.

894
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,680
Was that what it was called?

895
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,680
And like they did the it in the demo.

896
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,600
Yeah, it was like the demo enhanced or whatever was like the giveaway.

897
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,640
So yeah.

898
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,520
Oh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says two PS4, one PS5.

899
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,120
So yes, it's at three now.

900
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,720
But, you know, three games in concept.

901
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,480
Now there's PlayStation Plus extra.

902
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,880
It's a little extra.

903
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,880
It's going to cost you $14.99 a month or $99 a year.

904
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,720
What does that five bucks a month get you?

905
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:07,560
An extra 400 of the most enjoyable PS4 and PS5 games, including blockbuster hits from

906
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,080
the PlayStation Studios catalog and third party partners.

907
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,520
Games in the extra tier are downloadable for play.

908
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,680
So it's kind of like in that regard, it's kind of like Game Pass.

909
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,240
You don't stream them, you download them and play them.

910
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:29,160
It also sounds a little bit like that PlayStation 5 library of PlayStation 4 games that they

911
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,080
had at the launch, which they I would assume still have actually.

912
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,160
So I still don't own a PS5.

913
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:35,720
I couldn't tell you.

914
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,160
And there's going to be PlayStation Plus premium.

915
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:48,040
$17.99 a month or $120 a year, twice the price of PlayStation Plus premium.

916
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:57,640
All the benefits from essential and extra with another 340 games, which includes PS3

917
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:04,520
games that are available via cloud streaming and a catalog of beloved classic games available

918
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,480
both streaming and download options for the original PlayStation PS2.

919
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,320
And here's the surprise PSP generations.

920
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,360
That one was not in the leaks that PSP would be included in this.

921
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,280
No word about Vita, but we all know how Sony treats the Vita.

922
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:24,600
What?

923
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,960
We never had a console named the Vita.

924
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,520
Now it is mentioned this offers cloud streaming access for original PlayStation PS2, PSP and

925
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:38,280
PS4 games and extra and premium tier markets where PlayStation now is currently available.

926
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,920
Because in select markets, there isn't cloud streaming.

927
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,160
So you get something called PlayStation Plus Deluxe, which is a little lower than premium,

928
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:51,160
but you still get the downloadable PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PSP games for play.

929
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,200
So there it is.

930
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:59,800
It's basically a monthly fee to access retro games in a catalog.

931
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:06,920
I really wish Sony had gone the full Microsoft route and allowed you to play games that you

932
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,080
still own on disk because many of us do for free.

933
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:17,880
Because now this really shows there is no fucking reason you can't play your PlayStation

934
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,800
and PlayStation 2 games, at least on your PlayStation 5.

935
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,360
Well, I thought there was a reason like the drive doesn't work with those disks.

936
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,960
Okay, let's just say that that's the case.

937
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,680
There's so many games I own on the PlayStation 3, for example.

938
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,520
It sucks that I can't play those digitally.

939
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,400
I own them.

940
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,320
Let me have the PSP.

941
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,840
Let me have Dark Sakura do her story because it's really a yin and yang with this story

942
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,080
here.

943
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,760
And I don't I want to make sure we cover both before we open it up to the viewer comments.

944
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,720
So Dark Sakura.

945
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:57,480
Yeah, so it looks like that the rumor going on right now about the whole cloud thing has

946
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:02,120
to do with PS3 emulation and how difficult it is with the cell processor.

947
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,960
Although the rumor out there is that they are still working on that emulation.

948
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,000
That is just what's been the more difficult thing to get across.

949
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:24,360
There is another statement on here that saying that with what they were missing from that

950
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,520
announcement was addressing the issue of how they were going to emulate it and why they

951
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,240
were only going to leave PS3 stuff as cloud-based.

952
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,360
But again, that's the rumor that it may have to do with the cell processor.

953
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,960
I'm getting some comments in chat now.

954
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:47,720
DJ Rama S says, so the top tier to get access to PS1, 2, and PSP games in a possible download

955
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:52,280
stream format, even though you may have these games anyway, that is a crock of shit.

956
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,720
That's from DJ Rama S in our chat room.

957
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,280
Mishkins in our chat says, yeah, nah, I'm not even going to bother.

958
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,200
Lol, I'll stay with what I have already.

959
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,920
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the thing to realize about a company doing an emulation

960
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,640
versus a group like RPC S3 or whatever, is that one is called, we have a viewer who works

961
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,520
in that team, is that a company needs to also support it with customer service reps.

962
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,040
An independent emulator team can say, use at your own risk.

963
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:20,920
Sure.

964
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,520
But the independent emulator team has shown that it's possible.

965
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,880
Although I'm well aware that the RPC S3 doesn't run everything.

966
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,560
I think there's a chart and it runs like 60% ish.

967
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,800
Sorry if I got the number wrong, 60% ish of games start to finish.

968
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,360
And then there's others that it runs with issues.

969
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:47,720
And I imagine it probably has to do with that cell processor, because let's be real.

970
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,360
There's a lot of PlayStation 3 games that probably don't use many features that are,

971
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:58,120
because there was so much that was ported between the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

972
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,920
There's probably a lot of stuff that barely touches,

973
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,240
like some of the more advanced processing features of the PlayStation 3.

974
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:12,680
And probably it's the Sony first party games that obviously tie into that a little more.

975
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:19,240
And that's the stuff that Sony most wants and needs to get working on an official emulator

976
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,720
for them to want to release something like that.

977
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,800
And that I do understand.

978
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:31,080
And I didn't look at the list of compatibility and specifically like, where does God of War

979
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:35,640
and the Sony exclusives, where do they all fit in in the compatibility meter?

980
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:41,000
Because I would imagine the problem is that the Sony games are probably the hardest to emulate.

981
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,800
If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but that's what's probably the hang up right now.

982
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,800
I'm not mad about the cloud streaming.

983
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,840
And granted, maybe my perspective has completely changed

984
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,840
because I don't have a bandwidth cap anymore.

985
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,840
I'm fully willing to say that.

986
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,360
However, I do think it's kind of shit.

987
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:06,120
That if I still have PlayStation 3, 2, and 1 discs, they do nothing for me at this point.

988
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,160
If I don't still have working consoles that are 3, 2, or 1.

989
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,440
That I ought to be able to put those discs in my PlayStation 5

990
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,280
and get the digital assets for it, just like I do on Xbox.

991
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:26,760
I do want to know though, how were they emulating it on the cloud unless they have some sort of,

992
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,040
I'm just trying to think of how they're pulling it off through something cloud-based.

993
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,600
It's running on like a PS3 farm type of thing that specializes in that hardware.

994
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,800
That's kind of what I was thinking too.

995
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,760
But it's still just like, if they're going to go that far,

996
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:53,480
why not just put more of the effort into improving their emulation, creating a virtual processor?

997
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:58,040
And remember this, and I think it's the same, go ahead.

998
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,680
Sorry.

999
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,720
I was just saying, it's probably the same reason that they're not emulating,

1000
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,160
that like Planet Harrier still has trouble being emulated.

1001
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,600
And here's the thing, and I fully own the comments I've made before about,

1002
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,920
I do believe the PS3 ought to be emulatable on a PlayStation 5,

1003
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,400
because they're able to emulate it on computers,

1004
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,520
and all the progress that the independent teams have made.

1005
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:29,640
However, I do understand that the PS3 was incredibly fucking advanced for its time.

1006
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,120
Incredibly advanced for its time.

1007
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:40,280
Don't forget, the US military was getting PlayStation 3s to use that other OS feature

1008
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,200
to make those PlayStations do other things, because of the value that you were getting.

1009
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,720
Like the network Linux systems.

1010
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,680
Yeah, yeah.

1011
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,120
That's why it was such a big fucking deal when Sony took that other OS thing out.

1012
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,320
So I do understand.

1013
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:58,440
Yes, the PlayStation 3 was a lot more advanced at the time than I think people remember.

1014
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:05,720
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, would anyone here be interested in a PS5

1015
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:10,280
complete that has the PS3 cell processor inside the PS5?

1016
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,360
That way, they're no longer emulating, they are just running the hardware.

1017
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,920
Yes, I would love that.

1018
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,840
I don't have a PS5 yet.

1019
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:24,280
If they were to do a hardware refresh later this year, and they're going to do that,

1020
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:32,040
and if it will run my old PS3 disks and my old PS2 disks and PS1 disks, fuck yeah,

1021
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,400
I want that machine.

1022
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,120
That's the machine I wanted kind of from the beginning.

1023
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:40,840
But okay, maybe, you know, but now that it's been a couple years and chips have probably

1024
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:45,560
But now that it's been a couple years and chips have probably come down in price and so forth,

1025
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,400
yeah, I would actually love that machine.

1026
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,480
And even if it's the same price a PS5 is today, I would pay it.

1027
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,680
An all-in-one PlayStation, it's worth it.

1028
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,120
SD100Matt says, I would camp out for that machine.

1029
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:58,620
Same.

1030
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,640
I would be glad I waited.

1031
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,520
So we'll see.

1032
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:10,680
It'd be like the, instead of just the station, it would be like the play universe or something.

1033
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,600
Just yeah, like the PlayStation without a number.

1034
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:14,920
I don't know.

1035
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,800
That might be a little silly, but I just, the PlayStation all, I don't know.

1036
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,880
I would love that.

1037
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,760
I really, really would.

1038
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,840
But I think the hardware refresh we're going to get is going to be centered around the

1039
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:33,720
VR2 because I don't see why that is not Sony's big push this holiday is that new VR2.

1040
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,960
We've already seen them sowing the seeds for that.

1041
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,920
And I think we'll get that confirmed in June.

1042
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,520
So with whatever media event ends up happening.

1043
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,920
So, um, Sia Tabiri says the PlayStation hub.

1044
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,200
Hey, bonus if it has a PlayStation TV inside of it too.

1045
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,880
So my Vita games can get some love.

1046
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:53,800
Absolutely.

1047
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,320
Is this stuff that you like take in the morning to make yourself healthier?

1048
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,520
That's a Vita min.

1049
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,760
All right.

1050
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,880
Let's move on.

1051
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,520
In other news.

1052
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:06,920
Oh yeah.

1053
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,600
April Fool's day was this week, right?

1054
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,080
Everyone.

1055
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,040
And there was no, I skipped that day.

1056
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:12,520
Sorry.

1057
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:17,560
Well, there was, there was, I know we've all had our fill with April Fool's day and there's

1058
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:22,840
a lot of people that don't like, there there's certain things on April Fool's day that aren't

1059
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,880
funny and I don't need to retrend all that ground here, but there's a lot of things that

1060
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,380
aren't funny.

1061
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,720
Um, and a lot of companies get in on it and they're also not funny, but some companies

1062
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,880
do it and it's kind of cute.

1063
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,000
Like it's kind of cute.

1064
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,640
And I go, okay, if we had cute shit today, this day wouldn't bother me so much.

1065
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,880
Such as the dead by daylight one was pretty good.

1066
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:47,080
That dead by daylight one, um, that had the walking dead coming to it or whatever.

1067
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,360
Um, the Frasier pinball table was fucking funny.

1068
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,320
Like that was good.

1069
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,200
That was really good.

1070
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,160
That's awesome.

1071
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,560
And then Loki, I know, I know you have two stories here.

1072
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,880
Can you read the one about twitches April Fool's day?

1073
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,200
Cause I actually thought this was one of the better pranks.

1074
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,240
Yeah, that's the thing with April Fool's stuff.

1075
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,520
Like I hate, hate when they have like April Fool's pranks.

1076
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,720
They're like, well, I wish that some of that was true.

1077
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,040
You know?

1078
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:16,840
Um, so they, they had this kind of these, uh, different channels that they introduced.

1079
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,960
So like, for example, one of them was pizza time.

1080
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:26,120
It's everything about pizza, eating pizza, talking about pizza, cooking pizza, um, all

1081
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:31,000
that stuff, silent reading where you just watch people, I guess, read.

1082
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,680
I heard one girl had like 3000 viewers in that category.

1083
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,480
But it's funny.

1084
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:40,520
If I had been home and not in Vegas, I would have totally done a Bible reading stream

1085
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,640
where I was re reading the Bible for y'all.

1086
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:50,200
Um, character creator where you would, you know, spend hours making a character and a

1087
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,400
character creator.

1088
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,080
Honestly, Shane would be a streamer if that was a real category.

1089
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,640
I dark would have those streams every week.

1090
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:04,440
I would like to think I'll pick a game and make a character and never play the game.

1091
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,240
Chores, odd jobs and errands.

1092
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:12,200
So it's, it's you cleaning your house, I guess, or doing mundane tasks.

1093
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,440
They had one that was called literally just chatting.

1094
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,160
There's no cameras, no mics, no stream.

1095
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,680
You just, it's just a chat room.

1096
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,160
That's great.

1097
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,920
Hi, AOL.

1098
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,760
I kind of wish some of these would stay around.

1099
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,880
But I get that it's it's silly and maybe not the stuff that

1100
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,680
tweets the time.

1101
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,640
I think character creators should stay.

1102
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,360
I really do.

1103
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,480
I think that will stay.

1104
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,240
But whatever.

1105
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,760
See a Tiberian chat says one of the movie reviewers I followed did a comparison between

1106
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,280
the book that inspired the room.

1107
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,880
Oh, I don't I don't know if that's about the book reading category or just a different

1108
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,280
comment.

1109
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,200
But I thought that was about the book reading category.

1110
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,640
So there's that.

1111
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,400
Anyway, I thought that was all very funny.

1112
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,960
So yeah, I'm kind of sad.

1113
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,240
I miss that, to be honest.

1114
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,040
So that's, that's the cute sort of April Fool's Day prank.

1115
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,800
And, you know, as far as gaming goes, never forget.

1116
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:13,160
The game that probably has transformed the gaming industry more than anything else in

1117
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,080
the past 10 years started as an April Fool's Day prank.

1118
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,240
Pokemon Go.

1119
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:19,960
Goat Simulator.

1120
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,460
My friend.

1121
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,900
Pokemon Go started as a Google Maps.

1122
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,220
April Fool's Day joke.

1123
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:26,860
Don't forget.

1124
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:27,660
Well, yeah.

1125
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:28,620
What did they do for?

1126
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,860
I didn't see what Google Maps did.

1127
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:31,660
Did they do anything?

1128
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,260
Oh, I didn't see what Google did this year.

1129
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,540
No, I mean, I was kind of busy.

1130
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:37,820
Well, actually, my favorite dating sim started off as a joke, but I don't think it was an

1131
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:38,620
April Fool's joke.

1132
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:43,580
Now, that'd be funny as a dating sim baked in the Google Maps.

1133
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,980
Oh, I see a Tiberi says it was an April Fool's prank he was describing overall.

1134
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:50,540
I get it.

1135
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:51,260
I get it.

1136
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,500
So very nice.

1137
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:53,820
All right.

1138
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,580
Anyway, what else?

1139
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,420
What else was going on on Twitch, Loki?

1140
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:03,500
Well, apparently the Twitch had the pause their boost feature.

1141
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:09,740
Because it allows you to boost certain streams.

1142
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,820
I think you have to pay for that to promote them.

1143
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:17,100
And porn ended up there on the front page.

1144
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:19,200
Whoops.

1145
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,700
Uh, so they had to stop doing that.

1146
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:26,540
Whoops.

1147
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:26,780
How?

1148
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:31,500
Why could I mean, like, porn shouldn't be on Twitch anyway.

1149
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:36,460
So even if it got boosted, like, what's the I mean, I know it doesn't look great for Twitch,

1150
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,340
but like, shouldn't they be kind of screening that out?

1151
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,500
It shouldn't even be on the platform anyway.

1152
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,820
Like, is this really going to stop that?

1153
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,420
How's how's that?

1154
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:51,980
Like, I don't know how it's probably a lot of these unknown streams, like they create

1155
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,700
brand new account and just post porn on there.

1156
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,780
And then boost the channel to be like, haha, it's on the front page.

1157
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,140
I don't know what it takes.

1158
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:07,420
Like, if you have the paper boost, and then you also have to have like so many viewers.

1159
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,340
I mean, I don't know.

1160
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,180
I mean, like in the screenshot here, let's see.

1161
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,660
How many people do they have watching?

1162
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,460
Uh, several thousand.

1163
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,020
Let's see here.

1164
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:18,940
I can't see.

1165
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,740
It does not say what it is.

1166
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:28,140
And they put, you know, obviously that the game they're playing is like Grand Theft Auto

1167
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:28,780
5 or something.

1168
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:29,580
So.

1169
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:31,740
Interesting.

1170
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:35,020
They're just they're just going to need to screen the people that they allow to boost

1171
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,580
a little more carefully, like somebody at Twitch.

1172
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:43,020
I know it's a big job, but somebody at Twitch ought to be watching any stream, at least

1173
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:47,580
for a little bit before it becomes an affiliate and then only allow the affiliate stuff to

1174
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,620
get boosted.

1175
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:50,220
Like, that's really how it should go.

1176
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:52,700
I don't know.

1177
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,980
But I mean, it's not going to stop everything, but it'll stop a good chunk of it.

1178
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:57,600
Yeah.

1179
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:59,100
So I don't know.

1180
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,300
As soon as the terrible idea anyway, period.

1181
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:04,460
All right.

1182
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:09,260
By the way, I texted Shane a question just to follow up on the I said, I need to know

1183
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:14,380
for OLR, if Twitch's April Fool's Day character creator category was real, would you be a

1184
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,420
full time streamer?

1185
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,900
And the answer is yes.

1186
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:22,140
I have enough games with character creators that I could easily make it a full time job.

1187
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:27,100
No, and nobody was surprised.

1188
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,060
Nobody was surprised.

1189
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,700
I think I think they should keep it.

1190
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:31,820
All right.

1191
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:36,460
Anyway, let's move on to our next story.

1192
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,020
Who's on this?

1193
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:37,740
I think it's me.

1194
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:41,100
And I think this is a this is a very interesting story as well.

1195
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:48,620
This has to do with Bungie and going after a group that their day needs to fucking come

1196
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:49,100
already.

1197
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:52,860
And I'm talking about copyright trolls on YouTube.

1198
01:07:54,220 --> 01:08:00,060
We all know YouTube's copyright claim system gets inundated with bogus takedown requests.

1199
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:05,740
And we know the worst part about YouTube, a platform I've been critical of on this program.

1200
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:09,740
That doesn't mean I won't use it, or that I haven't even posted content on there or

1201
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:10,780
won't ever in the future.

1202
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:16,540
But I'm allowed to say this is the worst part of YouTube is that YouTube airs against the

1203
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,100
creators.

1204
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:22,700
Always, because they allow these bogus takedown requests to go through.

1205
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,820
And then the creator has to appeal it every time.

1206
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:32,300
Well, maybe it's gonna maybe finally some comeuppance is going to come for these copyright

1207
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:32,700
trolls.

1208
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,380
And it's thanks to Bungie.

1209
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:42,940
The game studio sued 10 anonymous people for allegedly leveling false DMCA claims against

1210
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,620
Destiny 2 creators on YouTube, even Bungie itself.

1211
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:54,220
There is a hole in YouTube's DMA security, according to the company that let anyone claim

1212
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:59,420
to represent a rights holder, letting any person anywhere abuse the system to suit their

1213
01:08:59,420 --> 01:08:59,900
own ends.

1214
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:05,580
Apparently, there was a Gmail account created in mid March that was supposed to mimic the

1215
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,820
developers copyright partner CSC.

1216
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:14,300
They then issued DMCA takedown notices falsely claiming to represent Bungie, trying to fool

1217
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:18,460
creators with another account that insisted the first one was fraudulent.

1218
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:26,220
So YouTube didn't bother to investigate at all and slapped producers with copyright strikes,

1219
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:28,140
and people had to remove videos.

1220
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,740
Now, YouTube has corrected the error since.

1221
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:36,540
But let's be real, this is only because Bungie got involved and made a phone call.

1222
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:38,940
Exactly.

1223
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:44,140
They thankfully, since YouTube and Google are affiliated, they were also able to suspend

1224
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:45,580
those Gmail accounts.

1225
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:49,740
So not very bright on the part of the YouTube trolls.

1226
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:54,140
But Bungie called it a circular loop of support.

1227
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:55,580
Oh, yeah, this is crazy, too.

1228
01:09:55,820 --> 01:10:02,540
Google said they had the global finance director email key personnel, and Google still would

1229
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:05,020
not share info to identify the fraudsters.

1230
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:11,500
So Bungie did a DMCA subpoena to help identify the attackers and punish them.

1231
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:16,300
Damages up to $150,000 for every false takedown notice.

1232
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:23,820
So yeah, YouTube in a comment said we take abuse of our copyright takedown products and

1233
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,660
abuse of our copyright takedown process seriously and terminate them.

1234
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,300
No, you don't.

1235
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:32,620
And terminate tens of thousands of accounts every year for violating our policies, which

1236
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:35,900
prohibits submitting false information in a takedown request.

1237
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,700
We'll continue our work to prevent abuse of our systems.

1238
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:42,860
And we're committed to taking appropriate action against those who knowingly misuse

1239
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:50,620
our tools, then reveal her, expose her, drag her YouTube, tell Bungie who it is, give them

1240
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:55,420
everything they need to know without having to go through the courts and mess up that

1241
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:56,220
system.

1242
01:10:56,220 --> 01:11:00,540
I, for one, am glad that Bungie is putting their foot down on behalf of their content.

1243
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:06,140
This is this is big ups on Bungie because they are sticking up for their content creators

1244
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:09,420
who have stuck by them covering Destiny 2 this whole time.

1245
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:13,740
So let's let's give kudos to Bungie because they're they're pouring money into their

1246
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:15,980
legal team to make this happen.

1247
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:19,180
And maybe change will finally happen because of what Bungie is doing.

1248
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:25,500
So I can't wait to see these YouTube copyright trolls get their comeuppance.

1249
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,580
Then again, I thought the Twitch hate raiders were supposed to get their comeuppance.

1250
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,060
And I haven't heard anything following on that.

1251
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:35,580
But I suppose it's supposed to be important to the front page now with boost.

1252
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:42,540
Well, honestly, honestly, I will take that any day of the week versus the hate raids.

1253
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,100
Give give me porn.

1254
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:49,500
Honestly, porn, porn, porn, porn all day, every day versus the hate raids.

1255
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,820
So all right.

1256
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:57,260
By the way, going back to the earlier story, but an important footnote, Bobby Blackwolf

1257
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:02,460
in our chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network points out Google declined to participate

1258
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,540
in April Fool's 2022.

1259
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:05,420
That's interesting.

1260
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,940
They usually go all out.

1261
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:10,460
I wonder if they were worried the current state of the world and, you know, everything

1262
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,780
going on with Ukraine and COVID and stuff.

1263
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,420
Maybe they just decided it wasn't a good taste this year.

1264
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:15,920
I don't know.

1265
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,020
It's interesting.

1266
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:25,580
Tiger Claw in chat says, I wish YouTube did something about people posting spoilers on

1267
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,780
the recommend section.

1268
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:29,260
Oh, is that of course, it's a thing.

1269
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:30,540
Why am I sitting here asking?

1270
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,060
That's of course, it's a fucking thing.

1271
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:37,740
I just I've never I also don't follow a lot of movies and I don't watch a lot of YouTube's

1272
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,780
about movie culture.

1273
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:41,420
And that's so I've just never fallen in that trap.

1274
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,140
But that doesn't surprise me, sadly.

1275
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,220
Yikes on bikes.

1276
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,940
Mike Deaf says that's more on the creators.

1277
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:54,940
It is, but that doesn't mean that action shouldn't be taken against them for not using spoiler

1278
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:55,580
tags.

1279
01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:00,780
Like there should be spoiler tags that then prevent your video from being advertised in

1280
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:01,340
certain ways.

1281
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:05,980
So but yeah, I bet some not your video.

1282
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,480
Yeah.

1283
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:13,260
So tire classes people on YouTube are posting spoilers from Sonic the Hedgehog two and the

1284
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,020
movie isn't out in the US yet because it came out in Europe.

1285
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:19,420
That's a slippery slope, though.

1286
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:23,420
So technically, the spoilers, they're in bad taste.

1287
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:25,260
But the movie is out in Europe.

1288
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,420
You know, the world doesn't revolve around the US.

1289
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,500
We like to think it does, but it doesn't.

1290
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:34,060
So but there should be there should be if YouTube had a spoiler tag, which I thought

1291
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:34,620
it did.

1292
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:38,540
If you do that a spoiler tag, and then those videos wouldn't show up in algorithms, that

1293
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,060
would be a good solution.

1294
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:43,020
Because people in Europe ought to be able to talk freely about it.

1295
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,220
I didn't know the movie came out.

1296
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:48,460
Why did I think that movie was still like months away?

1297
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:50,460
So it's next week.

1298
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,860
I showed you how much I follow movies anymore.

1299
01:13:52,860 --> 01:14:00,060
I do really want to see the Jamie Lee Curtis, Michelle Yo, everything everywhere all at

1300
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:00,540
once.

1301
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,260
I think it's called.

1302
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:02,860
I really want to see that.

1303
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:05,820
I haven't really wanted to see a movie in a very long time.

1304
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:10,460
I really want to see that because a Michelle Yo is a goddess.

1305
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:12,940
B Jamie Lee Curtis also goddess.

1306
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,340
C and she was very nice in person.

1307
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:21,500
I did not know that kid from the Goonies got back into acting, but apparently he's in that

1308
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,220
movie.

1309
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:23,420
Which kid from the Goonies?

1310
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,460
He was his name, Data.

1311
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:28,620
Oh, yeah.

1312
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,580
Yeah, he played that character.

1313
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:32,460
Yes, yes.

1314
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,940
So and he's in that movie.

1315
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:39,500
And there's a whole piece I saw on Apple News or something about how he's come back to acting

1316
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,620
after 40 years.

1317
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:43,020
And just the cinematography in that movie looks really good.

1318
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:48,300
So, oh, Tiger class says K Hui Quan.

1319
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,660
I'm sorry if I mispronounced that.

1320
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:49,820
Thank you.

1321
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:50,060
Did you?

1322
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,500
Rama said the name there.

1323
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,460
Tiger points out he was also short round in Temple of Doom.

1324
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:55,980
So true.

1325
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,500
Yeah, very true.

1326
01:14:58,620 --> 01:14:59,580
Anyway, Dr. Jones.

1327
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,580
Yeah, I think it's cool that he came back after all these years.

1328
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,660
But anyway, I really want to see that movie.

1329
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:07,420
So maybe I'll go to the movies next week.

1330
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:07,740
We'll see.

1331
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,260
I'd like to go.

1332
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,420
I want to see that terrible Morbius movie just because I love bad movies.

1333
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:16,860
I have not heard a good thing about that movie.

1334
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,220
Isn't Jared Leto in that movie?

1335
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,260
Yeah, apparently he was the good part of it.

1336
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,260
I cannot fucking stand it.

1337
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,860
And here's the ironic thing.

1338
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:29,820
It has nothing to do with all these stories about what a horror he is on set and all these

1339
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:30,060
things.

1340
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,620
I mean, not to discount any of that.

1341
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:36,540
I'm just saying I've never liked him as an actor, period.

1342
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:39,980
So I just I have no interest in that movie.

1343
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,980
But I am like you, Dark Sakura.

1344
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:46,940
When I hear a movie is a gigantic fucking train wreck of a film, it does make me a little

1345
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:47,980
more interested in it.

1346
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,620
It's not in a good way, though.

1347
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:57,420
It's just in a just like, I don't think it's in like, it's so funny because they're trying

1348
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,460
to take themselves seriously.

1349
01:15:58,460 --> 01:15:59,260
But it's awful.

1350
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,980
But like, it's more of just like, it's just awful.

1351
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:08,620
S2100 Matt in chat says, speaking of movies, so sad about about Bruce Willis.

1352
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,180
Yes, it is.

1353
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,980
That is very, very granted, though.

1354
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,580
He's been acting for a long time.

1355
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,540
I'd say he's had a pretty great career.

1356
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:26,140
Yeah, there's there's a lot of films to go back and celebrate, but it's it's still hard

1357
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:30,620
when you know, one of the all time greats, you know, has to walk away, not of their own

1358
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,820
decision, essentially.

1359
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:37,900
Well, whether or not it's a great or anything, it's it's a hard illness to have.

1360
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:38,620
Oh, sure.

1361
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,120
Sure.

1362
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:41,660
I draw a lot of comparisons to Tim Curry.

1363
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:46,460
In that regard, you know, Tim Curry should have been able to make a lot more movies.

1364
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:50,140
Unfortunately, he had the stroke and we all know he hasn't been the same since.

1365
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:55,340
It's a blessing that we've been able to see Tim Curry in limited capacity and things like

1366
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:56,380
animation.

1367
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,780
I know he did a cameo in that Rocky Horror remake, and that type of stuff.

1368
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:08,780
But I think we all know and I hope that Bruce Willis will be able to still be able to show

1369
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:10,060
up here and there.

1370
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:12,700
But I imagine he's already been doing that.

1371
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:13,980
He can't anymore.

1372
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,180
It really he's beyond being able to act anymore.

1373
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:17,500
That's really sad.

1374
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:22,220
He's been doing a lot of like straight to Netflix type videos and they've been all bad.

1375
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,660
And he's been no anime.

1376
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:28,460
And and that was the thought is like he's got to have something, you know, up with him

1377
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,580
because they've been you could see him with an earpiece that they're feeding him lines

1378
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,340
and stuff, and he's just not kind of there.

1379
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:37,340
And like that was kind of like, is he had dementia and what's going on?

1380
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,620
And they were close.

1381
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:44,060
But yeah, he's done a lot of movies, like a lot, a lot, a lot of movies recently, which

1382
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:48,060
is probably just trying to get the money for his kids, which is noble by all means.

1383
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,860
But yeah, I think he's done.

1384
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:55,340
I think it's just it's this time to retire.

1385
01:17:55,340 --> 01:18:00,620
Well, then be sure to buy the fifth element on Blu-ray and the six cents on something

1386
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:03,900
is that get get him those residual checks if you.

1387
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:04,140
Right.

1388
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:04,620
Yeah, yeah.

1389
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,060
Those movies, by all means.

1390
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:06,300
Yeah.

1391
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,100
Support that stuff.

1392
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,620
Don't support the stuff that's on Netflix where it's just like clearly phoned in.

1393
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,700
They have body doubles and all sorts of craziness.

1394
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,020
Not that stuff.

1395
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,620
And every Christmas, watch Die Hard.

1396
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:20,540
All right.

1397
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,540
Anyhow, you know what I watch on Christmas, though?

1398
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:24,780
I watch Batman Returns.

1399
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:25,340
That is my favorite.

1400
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,220
I watch Gremlins.

1401
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:32,460
OK, anyway, let's move on from Christmas to our next story, Dark Sakura.

1402
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:44,140
OK, so in other news, there is a rumor I'm going to put this on the rumor mill, but they

1403
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:47,660
think that eight Xbox Game Pass games have been leaked online.

1404
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:54,780
And so the list, I mean, it is a it's all the same family of games except for one.

1405
01:18:54,780 --> 01:19:00,460
It's Call of Duty, Black Ops Cold War, Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, Diablo

1406
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:06,300
2 Resurrected and then Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes,

1407
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:13,660
The Phantom Pain and Metal Gear Survive, which I mean, none of those are really surprising.

1408
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:19,660
I mean, maybe the Konami ones are, but they're soon to be acquisition of Konami.

1409
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:26,060
But at any rate, they're leaked for this month for April.

1410
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,780
So we'll see if it actually comes to pass.

1411
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:29,580
They call it used to have.

1412
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:34,380
Yeah, that makes sense because they own Activision or they're going to be owning Activision.

1413
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,620
Yeah, the first half makes a lot of sense.

1414
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:39,740
And Diablo 2 Resurrected will make a lot of people happy, that's for sure.

1415
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,100
Yeah, including me ish, although.

1416
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,140
I still know you like your Diablo.

1417
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:46,620
I do.

1418
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:52,940
But you also know I have not had the battle net thing installed since a lot of this Bobby

1419
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:53,740
Kotick stuff.

1420
01:19:53,740 --> 01:20:02,860
You know, it was still not I did buy Diablo 2 Resurrected, but I got worse after that.

1421
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:07,660
And I just I haven't been able to play it in good faith now that Microsoft's in the picture.

1422
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,020
I don't know.

1423
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:14,380
Again, you kind of have to there's bad and good and everything, I suppose.

1424
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:16,060
I don't know if I'll end up playing it or not.

1425
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:19,740
I probably will, because at least I see the finish line now.

1426
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:25,020
I see that there will come a day where Microsoft, well, I guess legislators are trying to stop

1427
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:25,500
it.

1428
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,420
And oh, that we didn't get to that.

1429
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:29,580
I think that was two weeks ago on the canceled show.

1430
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:34,140
But did you guys hear that stuff about how some of the senators and I think Bernie was

1431
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:39,900
one of them and some of the other senators came together to basically say they oppose

1432
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,620
the Microsoft Activision Blizzard thing.

1433
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,540
But it's not for the reason you think.

1434
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:48,380
It doesn't sound like it's for the reason that Microsoft would be too big a player.

1435
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,660
They're pissed off.

1436
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:54,460
Basically, the Bobby Kotick's getting a payday and that all these executives are getting

1437
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:57,180
a huge payday out of this and they don't deserve it.

1438
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,220
I know that was a thing in the news recently.

1439
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:00,460
Yeah.

1440
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:06,380
And I'm like, OK, like as much as I think I'm cool with Microsoft, because like Microsoft

1441
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:12,140
taking them over means the end of Bobby Kotick and that part I support.

1442
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:14,940
I think the senators raise an excellent point.

1443
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:17,580
Why are they getting all this money?

1444
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:21,580
I think it made a lot of the rest of us feel dirty about this whole acquisition.

1445
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:28,140
So, fuck, if we get if we get both sides of this, like Microsoft can get them and the

1446
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,220
senators are able to somehow cancel the payout.

1447
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,620
I don't even know if that can happen or if it would even work.

1448
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,300
But in my brain, it's going to.

1449
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:36,300
That would be the best possible scenario.

1450
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:38,380
That would be amazing.

1451
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:39,340
That would be amazing.

1452
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,740
That would make me proud to be an American.

1453
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,140
For once.

1454
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:45,740
At least we have something at that point.

1455
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:56,140
Anyway, but yes, the Konami inclusions, I would say they are surprising, but at the same

1456
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:58,460
time, I also am not surprised.

1457
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:04,700
OK, we all know Konami's business is in slot machines, pachinko, gambling, you know, our

1458
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,580
machines, machines in arcades and casinos.

1459
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:10,140
They've seen the rights for their games for terrible sequels.

1460
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:15,900
Yeah, as far as their video games go, it is about whoring, literally whoring them out

1461
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,820
on the corner for whoever's willing to turn tricks for them.

1462
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:26,140
And if that is putting them into classic game archives to release on consoles like

1463
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:29,180
the Castlevania Advanced Collection, then so be it.

1464
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:37,340
If that is to whore a good Metal Gear Solid game and some bad ones for Microsoft Game

1465
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,020
Pass to get some checks there, too.

1466
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:39,740
Hey, great.

1467
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:45,180
Will I download Metal Gear Survive just because it's free and I can?

1468
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:50,300
And like I told Dark Soccer earlier and the rest of you, I will play I will go not only

1469
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,220
go see a movie because it's so bad.

1470
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:54,460
I will play a game because it's so bad.

1471
01:22:54,460 --> 01:23:00,540
So I'm looking forward to playing Metal Gear Survive because it won't cost me anything.

1472
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:03,900
That Avatar game that came out like an age ago.

1473
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,540
And I actually enjoyed it.

1474
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:13,580
Yeah, kind of Questbuster in chat does want to point out it's not just executive pay either

1475
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,900
with the senators versus Activision thing.

1476
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:21,340
They were concerned that the deal, quote, threatens worker led demands for accountability.

1477
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,820
I would be it's a valid concern.

1478
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:31,260
I think Microsoft has replied to that concern because they have explicitly said they do

1479
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:33,340
not intend to union bust or any of that.

1480
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:38,060
But I understand that's Microsoft and that doesn't reflect what's actually happening

1481
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:41,020
at Activision now until the merger take place.

1482
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:44,620
So I think that is a good conversation to be had.

1483
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,120
Yes.

1484
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:46,160
So.

1485
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:51,340
And Dark Tetsuya says there is still that Turtles collection coming.

1486
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,580
Yes, Konami hoard that out too.

1487
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,020
That doesn't make it bad.

1488
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:56,780
It's not does it.

1489
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:58,140
It doesn't mean it's bad.

1490
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:03,020
I'm just saying Konami is selling them on the street for money and okay.

1491
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:09,340
But that is all Konami is interested in doing with their retro titles at this point.

1492
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,060
It's pretty clear.

1493
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,000
Anyhow.

1494
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:16,140
Let's move on.

1495
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,540
Who's got the next story?

1496
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:19,500
I think it's a Loki.

1497
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,040
Yep.

1498
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,220
All right.

1499
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:29,260
So let's talk a little bit about some possible updates to games because we talked a little

1500
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:35,660
bit how PlayStation Plus is changing and making you get into PlayStation now, which I really

1501
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:36,160
hate.

1502
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:42,640
But Xbox is actually talking about getting a games pass or a family plan option.

1503
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:47,920
So you will have to purchase game pass for every single member of the family.

1504
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,720
You'll be able to actually convert it over now.

1505
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:56,160
I'm not sure they mentioned a cost on that, but I like the idea, especially, you know,

1506
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,800
a lot of my kids that have access to a bunch of games.

1507
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,260
So.

1508
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:01,760
Cool.

1509
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,760
I'd like to know what the price is, but I'm down.

1510
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,400
And that would be for a game pass.

1511
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,520
Ultimate also, I think.

1512
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:12,480
Yeah.

1513
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,240
I mean, I don't know if I would have a lot of use for this because it's really just me

1514
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,320
and Alan and I aren't going to share anything like that.

1515
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:22,640
So, but it's, uh, you know, it's again, just Microsoft trying to get even more people on

1516
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:28,080
this, um, especially in the face of Sony now trying to launch their own product.

1517
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,920
Although, and I can't believe we didn't mention this earlier, but there were a lot of things

1518
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,520
to get into with that topic.

1519
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,000
One thing Sony is, is missing from their product is day one releases.

1520
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,840
And we all know the executives at Sony do not agree that those should be a part of a

1521
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,040
subscription service.

1522
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,120
They also want to charge $70 for them.

1523
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,320
I think that decision is going to bite them a little bit, but it is what it is.

1524
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,120
So, um, all right.

1525
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,320
Anyway, before I get into the next story, I do want to acknowledge this quest buster

1526
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:58,240
and chat says I missed the Konami that gave us things, things like sweet code and two.

1527
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,920
I miss them too.

1528
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:04,960
I hope we have all acknowledged and made peace with the fact that that Konami is dead and

1529
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,120
gone, literally gone.

1530
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,720
Those buildings closed.

1531
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:09,920
They're gone.

1532
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,360
So we all, that Konami is never coming back.

1533
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,360
Those people gone to new jobs.

1534
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,200
So I just, just as long as we all made peace with that.

1535
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,120
And also the go back to like, when we're talking about, you know, with the differences between

1536
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:30,880
game pass and Sony's PlayStation plus stuff, you know, when they make a game backwards

1537
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,080
compatible on the Microsoft side, that's a backwards compatible game.

1538
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,000
If you own it digitally, it's in your library.

1539
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,640
If you own it physically, you can play it on the disc.

1540
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,640
Sony, you can play what we give you, or you can buy it.

1541
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,880
That's messed up.

1542
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:49,380
I agree.

1543
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,800
Important note on the sweet code and thing though, which, which is a part of it.

1544
01:26:54,800 --> 01:27:00,720
Like there isn't like, because what they released sweet code and one and two on the

1545
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,840
PlayStation three.

1546
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:06,880
So if you had the original discs, they were collector's items, and then more people got

1547
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,080
to experience with the PlayStation three, but you can't play those games right now on

1548
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,520
a PS four PS five.

1549
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,840
I would imagine those games are going to be a part of the library.

1550
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,440
I don't know anything yet, but I just said Konami is going to whore their stuff out on

1551
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,880
the corner for tricks.

1552
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,320
I don't see why sweet code and won't be there, which will be great news.

1553
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,400
And Sony knows that's one that's going to get people to pay for the library.

1554
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:32,880
But I did want to read this comment from sacred Jade, because I absolutely agree with it.

1555
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,760
A sweet code and compilation would be chef's kiss.

1556
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,000
Yes, that's the compilation Konami needs to make.

1557
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:38,960
Get on it.

1558
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:39,520
But they won't.

1559
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:41,860
Anyway.

1560
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,720
Bobby Blackwell says Nintendo was the same with virtual console, and we all wish they

1561
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:51,520
brought back virtual console and got rid of NSOs.

1562
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,600
I think the problem there.

1563
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,840
It's not the system of delivery, but it's the fact that there are these gaps in NSO

1564
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,560
that virtual console is only highlighting.

1565
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,840
There are games that came out on virtual console that just Nintendo switch online doesn't see,

1566
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:14,160
you know, and they've they've been making progress to close the gap, like with the mother

1567
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,360
one and two releases.

1568
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:21,200
But I feel like that's that's a big part of the problem is that we know Nintendo has released

1569
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,040
stuff on those platforms that they can't get the third party rights to anymore.

1570
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,480
Like, I don't understand why they don't like they could literally do both.

1571
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:36,240
They could sell them virtual console and like, you could make your money back.

1572
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:39,040
Like, what's a subscription to Game Pass Ultimate?

1573
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:39,920
Like, 25 bucks?

1574
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,600
Like, or not Game Pass Ultimate.

1575
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,600
It was whatever.

1576
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,920
Nintendo's online expansion pass or whatever.

1577
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:53,200
Expand $25 on top of was a total like 40 bucks, whatever a year.

1578
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:58,560
Like, there are people that will buy at least five games and you're probably charging like

1579
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:04,400
at least $8 for those games, you would make probably more money than that because they

1580
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,920
want specific titles.

1581
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:10,320
They could also look at, hey, I don't want to buy these all individually.

1582
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,800
I want to just, you know, buy this pass.

1583
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,520
And that might make it more attractive one way or the other.

1584
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,960
Because if you're selling games individually, you can go look at how much value you're

1585
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,320
getting out of this, you know, subscription service instead.

1586
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:29,360
And it's when when you give player choice and you also make your package look more attractive.

1587
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,440
Like I don't understand why they don't do it.

1588
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:37,200
Licensing maybe because you're licensing the rights for a subscription service versus individual

1589
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,040
sales, but I think that can be tweaked pretty easy.

1590
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:40,560
I don't know.

1591
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,720
I just think I think we all know licensing is what's holding back Super Mario RPG.

1592
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:51,040
But the thing there is, I don't see why Nintendo and Square Enix can't sit down at the table

1593
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,520
and figure that out to get that game to come out.

1594
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:59,840
But maybe Square Enix wants to make it a standalone release so they can get more money off of

1595
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,840
it than just including it in the NSL library.

1596
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,920
I think that's what it boils down to that.

1597
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:07,360
Make a remaster or something like that and just put it out in a remaster.

1598
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,000
I don't know.

1599
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,880
Also, the chat is pointing out because I did bring up Sue Coden.

1600
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,760
They did bring up Aiden Chronicles, which is still coming out.

1601
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,680
Yeah, I actually kickstarted that one.

1602
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,680
And I'm in the Discord server.

1603
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,720
I don't follow it a lot, but they're still on track to get that out too.

1604
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:27,280
So Aiden Chronicles will be the spiritual successor to Sue Coden in a lot of ways.

1605
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,640
And that'll be really exciting.

1606
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:34,000
So all right, I want to get to one more story here before we get to the classic game of

1607
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,920
the week, although there's a little bit of a twist.

1608
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,040
I'll tell you about that in a moment.

1609
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:43,600
And that is about the game Loop Hero, which has been covered a lot lately.

1610
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:51,440
It's kind of an interesting little RPG that has a retro PC look to it, but it's actually

1611
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,520
made by a Russian developer.

1612
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,360
And at this point, with everything going on in the world, that Russian developer has said,

1613
01:30:58,880 --> 01:30:59,680
just pirate it.

1614
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:06,960
This was from a post on the social media platform VK, which I think is pretty big in Russia.

1615
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,240
It's VK.com.

1616
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:13,280
I haven't used it myself, but I always thought LiveJournal was the big thing in Russia because

1617
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:18,480
I know it took over, but that is another big social platform in Russia.

1618
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:26,000
The developer of the game Four Quarters was addressing Russian fans who can't access Steam

1619
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,640
or Nintendo Switch because of all the sanctions going on.

1620
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,440
Nobody can buy the game because all the companies are sanctioning because of what's going on

1621
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,000
in Ukraine.

1622
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:40,160
And so Steam and Nintendo don't accept payments and basically nobody can get Loop Hero.

1623
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:47,200
So the developers are like, torrent it, here is a link to RU Tracker, an official Russian

1624
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:52,080
torrent site, basically saying it is not known when all this will end.

1625
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:57,360
Therefore, in such difficult times, we can only help everyone to raise the pirate flag

1626
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:02,960
together with VPN and share the most popular distribution on the RU Tracker.

1627
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:09,520
That is a translated by Google Translate of one of the tweets, if you will, on that platform.

1628
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,680
Fans of Loop Hero are asking, is there ways we can directly support or compensate the

1629
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,240
developers?

1630
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,920
And due to the state-owned bank sanctions in Russia, the game developers can't cash

1631
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,040
out their earnings.

1632
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:27,920
So Four Quarters said, we are very grateful for your support, but the truth is that everything

1633
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:28,720
is fine with us.

1634
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,400
Send this support to your families and friends at this difficult time.

1635
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:39,120
So as much as you know, and when we've talked about what's going on with Ukraine and everything,

1636
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:45,200
that's why I'm very clear to point out this is Vladimir Putin's disgusting actions and

1637
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,440
war that's going on that he started.

1638
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:51,200
There's a lot of awesome people in Russia that want nothing to do with it.

1639
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,720
And it sounds like the makers of this game are a part of that bunch.

1640
01:32:54,720 --> 01:33:01,280
I mean, that is a very big thing to basically walk away from the potential earnings of your

1641
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:07,280
game because of bigger things that are going on in the world, you know, and just say at

1642
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,880
this point, fuck it, pirate it.

1643
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,880
So props to the folks behind Loop Hero for that.

1644
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:21,760
So there's a lot of good people who are suffering over this horrible persons.

1645
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:29,440
The only thing I can call it is toxicity on a major level because it's the type that it's

1646
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:39,440
like it's like a humanitarian Chernobyl, if that makes sense, that so many people are

1647
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:43,680
hurt had nothing to do with causing the incident.

1648
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:52,480
No one had anything to do with with creating it, but it's spreading, it's destroying lives

1649
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,120
and it's going to continue to hurt people for years after.

1650
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:55,620
Yeah.

1651
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,360
All right.

1652
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:01,360
Well, I don't have a clean way to make a transition here, but I am just going to find

1653
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:01,680
stuff.

1654
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:01,920
Yeah.

1655
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,000
We're just going to introduce our next segment here.

1656
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,520
Let me roll.

1657
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,480
Actually, thankfully, I have this little bumper that introduces it for me.

1658
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,200
So let's go to it.

1659
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:25,280
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1660
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,520
out a classic and tell you about it.

1661
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,160
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1662
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:39,040
But in a 2022 twist, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a handheld electronic

1663
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:43,120
handheld to spotlight as the classic handheld of the month.

1664
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:47,680
So Dark Soccer, what do you what you picked a pretty obscure one this week?

1665
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,720
So why don't you tell us about it?

1666
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,040
It's one of my favorites, which is why I picked it.

1667
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:58,000
So I picked the Puyo Lin of which I have blessed little information on that I could find, but

1668
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,080
I still wanted to to highlight it.

1669
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:07,920
And actually, I made a little teensy video to go with it, since there's literally no

1670
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:10,640
footage anywhere of someone playing one.

1671
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:14,720
Um, is this your is this your own music bed in it?

1672
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,800
No, this is actually from Puyo Puyo on Genesis.

1673
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:19,680
Okay, that works.

1674
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:21,140
Yeah.

1675
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:27,920
Um, so anyway, as you can see in here, the Puyo Lin, first of all, it coming out was

1676
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:35,120
a surprise, because not many people in America knew what Puyo Puyo was.

1677
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:38,080
It had never there'd never been a game in the US.

1678
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:42,880
Closest thing that we had was like Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

1679
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:49,520
So when this came out by Tiger in the US, it was really a surprise.

1680
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:56,960
Um, it's a little, you know, LCD keychain thing.

1681
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,680
It was about, yay, big.

1682
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,000
I can't find mine.

1683
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,560
I'm ever regretful of this and I want another.

1684
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,920
My birthday's coming up, y'all.

1685
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:16,320
Anyway, um, it was released in 1997, licensed by Compile made by Tiger Electronics.

1686
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:22,880
It came out in, of course, in Japan first, along with, uh, there was a Tempest, there

1687
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,520
was a Pong, there were a few others in the series.

1688
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:29,600
Um, and in Japan, it was called Puyori.

1689
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:35,280
So as you, if anyone can read the Kana on it, it clearly says that.

1690
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:40,320
Um, so they kept the same name here in the US and it was basically just little single

1691
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,160
player Puyo Puyo game.

1692
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:50,080
Um, what I thought was cool is that, uh, in fact, you can even see it right around here.

1693
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,360
It's got like the little, uh, Puyo button.

1694
01:36:54,480 --> 01:37:02,400
Um, the, uh, but the American one basically looked exactly the same, um, just in English.

1695
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:07,520
And it was, it was really a lot of fun.

1696
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:15,600
I, I played the crap out of one of these at my first job here, which was working at a

1697
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,040
GNC, which was also my last part-time gig.

1698
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,920
And, um, and yeah, I know they're on Amazon for 30 bucks, but I'm going to Disneyland,

1699
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,280
so I can't pay the money right now.

1700
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:32,320
Um, but at any rate, it's a fun little game, you know, it's just, you know, blip blip,

1701
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,880
you know, but I kept it on my key chain.

1702
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:42,640
I, I, mine was all scuffed up and terrible by the time I was done with it, but it was

1703
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:45,840
a fun, fun little, little, little toy.

1704
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,960
And for me at the time I was just excited.

1705
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,280
Dan found it for me at like a Walmart.

1706
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:56,240
Um, but, uh, and it was, I think like 10 bucks.

1707
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,720
Yeah, something like that.

1708
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,120
Um, but anyway, that's it.

1709
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,560
I think I'd like to try one sometime.

1710
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:10,080
That's interesting how it kind of came out here before the games had really caught on

1711
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,680
here at all, you know, before Puyo Puyo was the thing here.

1712
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,800
I think that's interesting.

1713
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,520
So, I mean, yeah, it was a big surprise.

1714
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,000
And now for, for me, I mean, Dan and I had been importing games forever and I had copies

1715
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:22,640
of Puyo Puyo.

1716
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:28,880
And so when, when Dan found that and gave it to me, I mean, we were newly together at

1717
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,120
this time too, but I was delighted.

1718
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,200
And yeah, they're, they're just really cute, fun, little, little LCD things.

1719
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,640
Good way to waste some time.

1720
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:44,000
I mean, we had the Mean Bean Machine and, um, um, Kirby's Avalanche at this point.

1721
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,200
That's what I said right at the beginning.

1722
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:45,760
Yeah.

1723
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:49,440
But, um, yeah, a lot of people didn't associate that with Puyo Puyo, of course.

1724
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,880
So, yeah.

1725
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:56,320
Well, because like I also said, nobody here had seen Puyo Puyo except those other two

1726
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,400
iterations of it.

1727
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,080
So, all right.

1728
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:04,160
Well, there it is your classic handheld of the month.

1729
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,400
And let's hear it for five minutes of video editing.

1730
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:06,720
All right.

1731
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:09,600
All right.

1732
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,840
Hey, I did that Ken Burns effect by hand.

1733
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,320
Okay.

1734
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:12,640
All right.

1735
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:21,680
Let us travel around the industry rapidly in some rapid fire news and we'll go to Loki.

1736
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:23,520
All right.

1737
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:28,480
So certain things off, um, it's funny.

1738
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,480
I actually played this game a while back.

1739
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:37,200
The original, uh, you may, this is a long forgotten platformer game that was put out

1740
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:38,960
gax.

1741
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:45,120
He was a quick witted gecko who used to have a bunch of different, like, uh,

1742
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:50,640
pop culture, um, one liners and whatnot.

1743
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:54,800
So there was supposed to be a spinoff for the series called Gex Jr.

1744
01:39:55,680 --> 01:40:00,240
And apparently a prototype demo was made for that back in 2001.

1745
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:05,920
And now that has leaked out because obviously it never became a thing, but that's pretty

1746
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,320
awesome that you can actually, uh, check it out.

1747
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:15,120
Um, I probably will not be checking it out because I've unfortunately don't love gex

1748
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:16,480
as much as I used to anymore.

1749
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,240
That's just the thing.

1750
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:28,000
Um, and then of course, uh, to try to get you excited about the, uh, was it paramount

1751
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:34,960
plus they're going to be releasing the first episode of halo, uh, free to watch on YouTube

1752
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:35,760
for one week.

1753
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,800
And you can decide whether you want to subscribe to the series.

1754
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:43,200
I hear that the series falls really after the first episode.

1755
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,720
So that's what I hear too.

1756
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:48,800
I guess the they'll, they'll trick you.

1757
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:54,160
They come in and, you know, come in there and watch it and disappoint you with episode

1758
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:58,800
two, but you can check out the first episode that first week is already in progress.

1759
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,480
March 31st was the first day.

1760
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:03,760
So you got to get on that quick if you want to watch it.

1761
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:09,120
So, um, Bobby Blackwell, Bobby Blackwell in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network

1762
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,960
says they did this with Picard too.

1763
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,080
The first episode is, was on YouTube or is on YouTube.

1764
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:20,080
I believe they did that with, um, drag race all star six too, which was also a paramount

1765
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,040
plus exclusive.

1766
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,440
So they're doing that with a lot of the paramount plus shows.

1767
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:26,480
I am just not interested in paramount plus at all.

1768
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:31,040
I, I actually will say it's one of the better subscription services.

1769
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,800
Um, but I'm also a Trekkie.

1770
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:37,200
So, but, uh, what they've been doing in Picard.

1771
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,280
Cause I hear that show is not great.

1772
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:42,800
I'm not up to current on that as much as I just said.

1773
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,240
I can't completely the opposite.

1774
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:44,960
Yeah.

1775
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,640
I I'm not up to speed on season two yet, so I can't tell you.

1776
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:49,920
So, um, yeah.

1777
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,160
And as far as a lot of the reality garbage, well, the one thing that did piss me off about

1778
01:41:54,160 --> 01:42:00,240
paramount plus was that they pulled the international versions of survivor, which yeah, the, the

1779
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,960
Australian version of survivor is so fucking good.

1780
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,280
Like I think Jeff probes just didn't want the competition.

1781
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,200
So anyway, all right.

1782
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,560
Uh, dark soccer, what do you have?

1783
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:15,760
Uh, the Nintendo direct came with a very sad announcement.

1784
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:20,720
Well, you can take it both ways, but breath of the wild two has been delayed to spring

1785
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,000
2023.

1786
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:26,480
They did release though, another trailer that people are already picking apart.

1787
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:30,480
Um, like, did you see the state of the master sword?

1788
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,720
It looked like it had been eaten by acid.

1789
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,760
It was pretty crazy.

1790
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:40,720
But anyway, I'll Numa, um, issued an apology and, uh, the, I would rather it be delayed

1791
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:44,480
and be good then come out on time and be terrible.

1792
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:53,600
So anyway, um, moving on, uh, there is a, uh, switch online.

1793
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,320
NES SNES collections are been updated.

1794
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:02,000
Earthworm Jim to dig dug two and Mappy land are on the list.

1795
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:07,440
Um, I, I freaking love all things Mappy.

1796
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,680
Mappy land is a weird little game though.

1797
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:13,760
Um, but it, it's fun to have a few more on there.

1798
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,760
Although dig dug two is not super great.

1799
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,040
Mappy lands kind of, it's, it's not map.

1800
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,320
I mean, it's Mappy, but it's not.

1801
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,000
It's not, it's, it's Mappy world.

1802
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,920
Well, I mean, there was also, that was around the same era.

1803
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,360
They were doing things like pack land.

1804
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:25,760
Yeah.

1805
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:26,080
Yeah.

1806
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:26,880
And all of that.

1807
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:31,600
So, um, Japan got something kind of cool too.

1808
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,040
I forgot what it was in the moment.

1809
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,720
Um, dark to see, what was it?

1810
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:37,600
Japan got, cause they got something kind of interesting

1811
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:38,880
instead of earthworm Jim too.

1812
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,840
Um, they got a different title.

1813
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,360
Uh, dig dug two is weird.

1814
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,000
It's one of those games where it's just like the sequel has

1815
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,280
nothing to do with the original.

1816
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,920
And that's what is kind of weird about it.

1817
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,360
Um, well, I'll, I'll be perfectly honest.

1818
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:58,000
You know, I've got that little arcade one up.

1819
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,560
That's got a dig dug and dug dug two on it.

1820
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:05,360
And I'm actually trying to, I'm considering rehoming it.

1821
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:08,480
You said it's an arcade one up.

1822
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,920
Well, it's, it's not an arcade.

1823
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,520
I don't think it's an arcade one up.

1824
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,480
It's one of those little mini desktop.

1825
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:17,840
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1826
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,800
What else is on it?

1827
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,080
Is it just those two?

1828
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,200
Dig dug and dig dug two.

1829
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,320
Oh, I thought it was.

1830
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:26,400
But we got the, the one that's got the bunch more machine,

1831
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,520
the much more games on it.

1832
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,640
Dan found one.

1833
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:32,800
And then we also have the one with Galaga and Galaga 98 on it.

1834
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,560
I may or may not be interested in that actually.

1835
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,400
Cause I love to talk the original.

1836
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:42,880
Yeah, we should talk, but, but I'm also just looking at getting an Amco machine.

1837
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,560
So that has everything in it.

1838
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:45,620
All right.

1839
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:51,120
Um, Harvest Moon is the game that Japan got instead of Earthworm Jim too.

1840
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:52,160
I looked at that one.

1841
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:53,120
Oh, they got the better deal.

1842
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:56,960
I, I, I don't, well then again, I'm not the biggest fan of Earthworm Jim.

1843
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,440
So, but it's, it is very America.

1844
01:44:59,440 --> 01:44:59,940
Yeah.

1845
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:00,720
All right.

1846
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:01,600
Yeah.

1847
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:06,080
A game that burps the title and the introduction is very American, I guess.

1848
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:07,360
All right.

1849
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:10,800
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some new games

1850
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:14,000
coming to a store shelf or a digital storefront near you.

1851
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:14,500
Loki.

1852
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:15,680
Yes.

1853
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:20,480
We have the Lego Star Wars, the Skywalker saga coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch,

1854
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,400
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

Happy's humble burger farm on Nintendo switch.

1860
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,000
That's a horror game by the way.

1861
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:51,040
The house of the dead remake on Nintendo switch and that's it.

1862
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:53,620
All right.

1863
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:58,320
Let's go to Japan and check out the releases over there.

1864
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:03,120
Um, I think we want to be looking at releases on April the seventh, um, which

1865
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:08,000
would include on Nintendo switch behind the screen and defoliation, uh, comes out

1866
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,840
in a regular and a special edition.

1867
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:14,320
And we also have metal dogs in a regular and bow.

1868
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:14,720
Wow.

1869
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:15,280
Wonderful.

1870
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:18,160
Addition is coming out.

1871
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:22,480
By the way, this is one of those like Nintendog type of games.

1872
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:26,080
I don't know why they're metal dogs, but I get, Oh, now I'm looking at

1873
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:30,320
screenshots and literally this game looks like Nintendogs meets Contra.

1874
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:32,320
What the fuck?

1875
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,360
This game looks rad.

1876
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:35,600
What?

1877
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:35,920
What?

1878
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:36,880
This looks cool.

1879
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:37,600
Hold on, hold on.

1880
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:38,240
I need this in my life.

1881
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,040
Stop the presses.

1882
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,320
Stop the presses.

1883
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:41,680
Is this our new president cat?

1884
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:45,760
I was like, I think we have another one of those games where I need to know,

1885
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,080
like, why doesn't this shit come out here?

1886
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:50,720
Unless I just did check the chat.

1887
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:51,680
I just linked it.

1888
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:56,640
Um, for our live listeners over at Twitch, uh, I need this.

1889
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:58,240
What is, this is awesome.

1890
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:01,920
Looking set in a world after the destruction of humankind, the harsh

1891
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,080
PlayStation two game.

1892
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:04,720
Is it really?

1893
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:05,280
It is.

1894
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,240
I don't know this game.

1895
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:06,800
Super old.

1896
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,000
So they've just ported it on the switch because why not?

1897
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,680
I'm going to look it up middle.

1898
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:15,760
That's cool.

1899
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:16,560
I want that game.

1900
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:16,880
All right.

1901
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:17,360
Anyway.

1902
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:17,520
Yeah.

1903
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,200
They have giant like, uh, guns on the back.

1904
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:19,840
It's on steam.

1905
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:21,120
Is it really?

1906
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:22,000
Yeah.

1907
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:22,880
It's on steam.

1908
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:23,760
Well, stop.

1909
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:24,320
Oh my God.

1910
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,040
It's adorable.

1911
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:30,000
How did I not know about this steam link in chat?

1912
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,880
I guess, I guess some things slip under my nose.

1913
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:36,160
Sometimes there's just, I've posted stuff like this on Twitter before.

1914
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,320
Loki, everybody.

1915
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:47,120
There are too many games, too many games, too many games, too many.

1916
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,160
There are too many games.

1917
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:49,760
I can't play and remember them all.

1918
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:55,680
And it's one of the, and I think in the case of this game, you could probably go back to

1919
01:47:55,680 --> 01:48:02,080
an old episode of OLR circa 2006, where I got excited about this game before, but it's

1920
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:02,960
been that long.

1921
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,520
And I'm that old where you could show it to me again.

1922
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,640
And I'm like, Oh, this is new.

1923
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:12,800
If you want something to be excited about on the switch, there was a video I saw recently

1924
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:18,640
by John Riggs who played a game called super cyborg, which looks exactly like Contra.

1925
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,280
So you should check that out.

1926
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:21,780
Okay.

1927
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:26,960
I would be interested in a new Contra game because Konami can't.

1928
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:27,460
All right.

1929
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,360
Moving over to Japan's PlayStation five releases.

1930
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,000
We have Lego star Wars is out there as well.

1931
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,760
MLB the show 22 is also out in Japan this week.

1932
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,720
And that's about it.

1933
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:45,120
And I would read Xbox releases in Japan, but using Xbox in Japan in the same sentence doesn't

1934
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:45,680
work.

1935
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:48,080
So we will go to the UK dark Sakura.

1936
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,000
How dare this only be on windows?

1937
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:52,180
Biased.

1938
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:53,380
Anyway.

1939
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:59,760
On the fifth for the big three, we have Lego star Wars, the Skywalker saga.

1940
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:06,000
We also have crisis remastered trilogy for the switch on the seventh for the PlayStation.

1941
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,160
We have road maintenance simulator.

1942
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:09,760
They're really getting into those Sims, aren't they?

1943
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:15,920
On the eighth, we have the a 500 mini which I believe was on a mega computer.

1944
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:21,600
Um, we also have doki doki literature club plus for PlayStation.

1945
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:25,040
Also Lake for PlayStation for PlayStation switch.

1946
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:30,880
We have skull, the hero Slayer on the eighth, also for switch legend of mana, final fantasy

1947
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,720
nine world of final fantasy Nickelodeon cart racers.

1948
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,120
And the C Finney.

1949
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:38,960
All right.

1950
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,440
We have a few more news stories for you all.

1951
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:45,360
And then we'll get to the listener round table where you can call and chat with us on our

1952
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:50,560
discord server, or you can send us emails to participate at orange laundry.com.

1953
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:53,920
Or you can ask us questions in chat about whatever you like.

1954
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,640
But before we get there, we have some more stories.

1955
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:57,840
So we're going to start with Loki.

1956
01:49:58,960 --> 01:49:59,520
Yes.

1957
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:06,000
So this is a story about how Epic is being sued because Fortnite stole someone else's

1958
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,720
dance.

1959
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:10,000
You may remember that we've kind of gone through this before.

1960
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:18,000
And I believe that the court system said that they couldn't award damages to the choreographer

1961
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,880
before because those dance numbers or routines were not copyrighted.

1962
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:30,320
But that brings us to today, where we have now a lawyer representing the choreographer

1963
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:37,120
Kyle Hana Gami, he sued epic for copyright infringement for his it's complicated of the

1964
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:38,320
dance emote in Fortnite.

1965
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:44,080
But he does actually have the copyright for his choreography.

1966
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:46,400
So that's a different story.

1967
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,640
Oh, I guess.

1968
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:52,640
Guess Epic Games is going to have to get rid of it or settle.

1969
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:58,320
But epic, but Epic Games is a poor little indie company with no money, whatever they're

1970
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:59,280
going to do.

1971
01:50:59,280 --> 01:50:59,780
Yeah.

1972
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:06,480
So they did not credit him nor consent to use display, reproduce, sell or create derivatives

1973
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:09,280
based off of his registered choreography.

1974
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:15,360
It is it is a bummer in a way because meme dances are a lot of fun to see show up in

1975
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:19,600
games like remember World of Warcraft back when it was cool or profiting off of this

1976
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:20,320
stuff, though?

1977
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:24,320
Yeah, no, I get Yeah, when you're selling well is does Fortnite sell that as a micro

1978
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:24,880
transaction?

1979
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,560
I imagine they do believe that they do.

1980
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,200
Yeah, then that's that's where it gets dicey.

1981
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:33,760
And where Yeah, the director or the choreographer, excuse me, probably deserves their fair share

1982
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:34,260
of the money.

1983
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:37,620
Yeah, interesting thing about Fortnite.

1984
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:43,700
Um, I did not realize that they the building, I knew they were taking it out for the season,

1985
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:47,780
but I guess there's now like a no build mode in the game permanently.

1986
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:53,940
Like where you can play Fortnite without the building element and never before have I wanted

1987
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:58,820
to actually try Fortnite again more because the building was the thing I never understood.

1988
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:01,940
You take the only distinct thing out of Fortnite.

1989
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:02,440
Cool.

1990
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:03,940
Generic shooters.

1991
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:04,520
Yay.

1992
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:07,380
I have no interest in playing Fortnite.

1993
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:10,820
Generic shooter with Ariana Grande.

1994
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:12,420
Just saying.

1995
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:14,580
She's important.

1996
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:15,720
All right.

1997
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:17,460
Moving on.

1998
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:21,300
Actually, Ariana Grande does usually have a presence on my stream.

1999
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:25,140
I will admit a little less conversation.

2000
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:25,860
As she should.

2001
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:26,920
All right.

2002
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:28,980
Moving on Dark Sakura.

2003
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:37,860
Um, so the, uh, the developer of Abandoned claims, uh, they reached out to Silent Hill's,

2004
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:50,500
uh, uh, the publisher Konami, evil, evil, evil, evil, um, to try to, um, to, uh, get

2005
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:51,940
the license for Silent Hill.

2006
01:52:52,180 --> 01:53:02,980
Um, uh, they, uh, uh, Hassan Karaman, uh, reached out and the quote is I reached out to them.

2007
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:07,620
I was stressed out because people thought it was Silent Hill about, about his game.

2008
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:10,580
Um, it got so out of hand, you know, you're the small developer.

2009
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:11,780
You've never had a big audience.

2010
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:12,980
You're inexperienced.

2011
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:16,100
I reached out to Konami saying, Hey, you know what?

2012
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:17,460
It was never my intention.

2013
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:18,420
And they were really cool.

2014
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:19,640
Hmm.

2015
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:28,580
Um, so, but yeah, there's people out there thinking that his game is a Silent Hill game.

2016
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:32,500
Uh, and I'm like, why do you think that?

2017
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:33,940
Can you not read the title?

2018
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:38,020
Can you not read that Kojima had nothing to do with this internet gonna internet.

2019
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:40,420
So dumb.

2020
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:42,020
I mean, I don't want to use that word.

2021
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:43,300
That's so pointless.

2022
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:43,800
Yeah.

2023
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:52,760
But anyway, um, and also, uh, there are rumors that abandoned would be canceled and the rumors

2024
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:53,260
are false.

2025
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,400
Well, it sounds like it's a pretty kick butt game.

2026
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:01,800
It's it sounds like that, you know, if people keep comparing it and wanting it to be a Silent

2027
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:04,520
Hill game so badly, let's be real.

2028
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:09,560
That, um, hollow husk of a once great company is never going to put out a Silent Hill game

2029
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:11,240
that's worthy of our time.

2030
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:17,160
So, you know, why not play that spiritual successor, even if it's not actually a successor?

2031
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:17,560
I don't know.

2032
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,760
Could have had one.

2033
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:19,160
I know.

2034
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:19,800
But no.

2035
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:25,080
I know, but no cannot is this the first in many bad decisions by Konami, but you know

2036
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:28,520
what we've talked about that literally a million times.

2037
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,040
So let's go on to our next story.

2038
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:31,420
Loki.

2039
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,100
Yes.

2040
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:37,880
So this is exciting because I completely forgot about it, but apparently the Stanley parable,

2041
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:41,960
ultra deluxe is going to be coming out April 27th.

2042
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:49,320
So that is very soon and you'll be able to play that on the switch PlayStation for PlayStation

2043
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:53,640
five, Xbox one, Xbox series, and I'm assuming PC.

2044
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:59,080
So, well, I would hope because that's, I can't wait for most people play the game originally,

2045
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:00,040
but, uh, yeah.

2046
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,520
How many years from the original is this finally coming out?

2047
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:03,240
That's pretty cool.

2048
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,640
It's been a while, a long time, long time.

2049
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:09,640
So I almost feel like the original can be a classic game of the week pretty soon.

2050
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:11,320
So, all right.

2051
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:11,880
Probably.

2052
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:12,380
Yeah.

2053
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:13,880
All right.

2054
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:18,840
Well, speaking of classic games, that takes me to our last official headline of tonight

2055
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:24,280
and the potential of a Capcom arcade second stadium being released.

2056
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:29,480
Apparently the game rating and administration committee of Korea has rated Capcom arcade

2057
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:31,000
second stadium for PC.

2058
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:36,440
Um, the, the ratings board in Korea has kind of leaked games before.

2059
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:40,840
So this is definitely one of those, Oh, there might be smoke and fire type of thing here.

2060
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:46,520
Uh, this would be a followup to the Capcom arcade stadium collection that was released

2061
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:48,360
in February, 2021.

2062
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:55,480
Um, what's interesting about that though, is that I thought the first stadium was built

2063
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:56,920
to be aware.

2064
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:59,640
I mean, you, you get download packs for the first one.

2065
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:05,560
Like I thought the first one was supposed to be editable enough so that they could add

2066
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:06,280
stuff to it.

2067
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:09,560
I don't see why they need to release a second stadium.

2068
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:10,680
That seems weird.

2069
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:14,840
And I don't even know if I can blame a money thing because I I'm pretty sure Capcom arcade

2070
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:18,280
stadium is free and you get like one game with it.

2071
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:22,040
But then of course, you know, in the great tradition and other games do this too, like

2072
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:26,120
the pinball effects type of things you have to pay for all the extra machines.

2073
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:28,840
So it's, it's not even really a money thing.

2074
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:33,640
It's just weird that it's not all just going into Capcom arcade stadium.

2075
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:36,600
I don't know why they need to have two different stadiums.

2076
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:37,240
So weird.

2077
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:41,800
And dark Tetsuya in our chat seems to agree with that line of thinking saying, sounds

2078
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:43,480
like it might be a whole new thing.

2079
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:43,960
I agree.

2080
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:46,120
I thought for sure they would just expand the first one.

2081
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:47,880
Yeah, that part doesn't make sense.

2082
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:55,080
So we'll see what has apparently also been rated is Capcom arcade second stadium bundle

2083
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:55,880
one.

2084
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:58,840
So that also implies that it will be in packs.

2085
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:03,960
There was a lot missing from the first arcade stadium because Capcom's made a lot of arcade

2086
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:04,460
games.

2087
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,840
But there was a lot of good stuff in that first one too.

2088
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:11,320
Like I know Dark Sakura is very, very partial to Strider, the original arcade game, and

2089
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:12,040
that is in there.

2090
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:15,960
You know, one of the Street Fighter games, not all of them, but one of the, you know,

2091
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:18,600
or maybe two, I can't remember, but that's in there.

2092
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:20,440
But there are, it's certainly missing a lot of stuff.

2093
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:21,960
So it'd be, it'd be interesting to see.

2094
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,600
I wonder if they'll put in it.

2095
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:29,560
Some of the games they've released before, like magic sword, they put out magic sword

2096
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:32,840
and final fight in a compilation on Xbox 360.

2097
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:38,920
And I think PS3 in that era, I'd be very curious if maybe they just release it again in this

2098
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:39,480
compilation.

2099
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:41,240
I wonder if it's not some of those games.

2100
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:46,280
So, uh, dark to see it says if they put black tiger in it, I'm more than happy to pick it

2101
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:46,680
up.

2102
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:47,180
Yeah.

2103
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:49,340
So, all right.

2104
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:54,460
Anyhow, that is everything we officially had on the agenda for tonight, but it's time for

2105
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:56,060
the listener round table and your thoughts.

2106
01:57:56,780 --> 01:58:01,900
If you have any emails, you can send them to participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

2107
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:05,340
I don't think we had any tonight, but let me check with dark Sakura on that.

2108
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:07,020
I could have got that wrong.

2109
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:08,380
Nada.

2110
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:09,340
She's shaking her head.

2111
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:09,660
All right.

2112
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:13,740
Usually I would fill this time with drag race chatter while we don't get emails.

2113
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:16,220
But to be fair, I did already talk about that earlier in the evening.

2114
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:18,140
So I'm not going to put y'all through it again.

2115
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:20,140
Yes, you did.

2116
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:25,900
So, um, if you guys have any questions in chat, you can go ahead and ask those over

2117
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:30,460
twitch.tv slash vog network or any topics maybe we didn't cover that you're curious

2118
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:31,580
about our take on.

2119
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:37,980
And, uh, of course, uh, if you want to give us a call vog network.com, VOG network.com

2120
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:41,180
slash discord and the green room is the place to go.

2121
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:43,980
And, uh, we'll, we'll bring some callers on the show that way.

2122
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:45,980
Um, throughout the cool kids.

2123
01:58:45,980 --> 01:58:46,780
All right.

2124
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:47,020
Yeah.

2125
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:52,220
So let me check, uh, and see maybe if there's any last minute stories that Loki has that

2126
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:53,500
maybe we want to get into first.

2127
01:58:54,540 --> 01:59:00,380
Uh, Sony has laid off 90 employees because as part of their, uh, sales and marketing

2128
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:06,060
staff or merchandising staff, and they're focusing more, they were apparently, um, they're

2129
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:08,060
focusing more direct to consumer.

2130
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:09,660
And so they don't really need those folks.

2131
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:14,140
Well, if you're selling digital PS fives, that's the only way to go, right?

2132
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:15,660
I guess, yeah.

2133
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:18,380
So that's unfortunate.

2134
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:22,860
I did like that with, uh, the free games with prime that we get with, uh, Twitch and stuff

2135
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:25,660
like that, that one of the games is called Turner boy commits tax evasion.

2136
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:27,100
I have that game.

2137
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:29,020
It's how appropriate for this season.

2138
01:59:29,020 --> 01:59:30,460
I didn't even know that was pretty funny.

2139
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:30,940
That's great.

2140
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:32,300
I didn't know that was the thing.

2141
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:36,140
I'll have to check that out and monkey Island two special edition and oblivion.

2142
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:38,700
There are so many free games.

2143
01:59:38,700 --> 01:59:41,020
I forget to grab like all the time.

2144
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:43,340
So, especially on Twitch, Twitch has a ton of them.

2145
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:43,900
I can't forget.

2146
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:45,580
Does Twitch still run their own client?

2147
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:46,540
I'm pretty sure they do.

2148
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:48,780
Like they have their own front end store.

2149
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:51,260
Um, some are part of that.

2150
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:57,020
Some are like, I know in this one, uh, elder scrolls four is part of good old games, plants

2151
01:59:57,020 --> 01:59:59,420
versus zombies is, uh, origin.

2152
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:03,260
So there's, it's kind of a mixed bag.

2153
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:04,380
Oh, did your MSS?

2154
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:05,900
The Twitch app is being shut down.

2155
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:06,700
Oh, I didn't know that.

2156
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:10,620
I mean, it's not my games going hugely surprising.

2157
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:13,820
That's probably like through Amazon gaming or something like that through your digital

2158
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:14,700
library through them.

2159
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:16,320
Probably.

2160
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:21,740
Oh, you know, I, you know what I would do if I was a Amazon, I'd push it all through

2161
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:22,140
Luna.

2162
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:23,980
That's what I do.

2163
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:24,140
Yeah.

2164
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:25,740
Maybe that's what they're aiming to do.

2165
02:00:25,740 --> 02:00:26,220
Yeah.

2166
02:00:26,220 --> 02:00:32,060
I would be shocked if that isn't, if they're really running that siloed over there, then

2167
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:35,820
I don't understand Amazon strategy because the smart thing to do would be to push it

2168
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:39,820
all into Luna and have people install a Luna client on their desktop.

2169
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:43,820
And then they can stream these games over here, but these ones in their library, they

2170
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,660
can, you know, run for free or whatever.

2171
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:47,340
So interesting.

2172
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:47,660
All right.

2173
02:00:47,660 --> 02:00:48,220
So yeah.

2174
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:50,380
Rama says the desktop app is shutting down.

2175
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:53,420
I guess I'm not totally surprised, but maybe a little surprised.

2176
02:00:55,420 --> 02:00:57,500
Uh, any other last minute stories, Loki?

2177
02:00:58,780 --> 02:00:59,740
Uh, nope.

2178
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:00,780
No.

2179
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:02,460
No.

2180
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:03,020
Sorry.

2181
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:03,580
Well, let me see.

2182
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:04,540
What else can I talk about?

2183
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:06,460
I was trying to see if there's anything for my trip.

2184
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:09,500
I didn't get into, um, I lost a lot of money.

2185
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:15,100
So the, the little parody intro tonight was not a joke.

2186
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:15,900
I lost a lot.

2187
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:19,500
Well, not look, I set a budget and I stick to the budget.

2188
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:24,300
So I know, like, I know I'm walking into this and I'm going to lose this money.

2189
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:27,900
So yeah, except the one time I won a bunch of money, then I didn't lose it.

2190
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:30,380
But, um, that doesn't, doesn't happen all the time.

2191
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:35,820
Uh, tiger claw, bring in the receipts on the Twitch desktop app saying it's true.

2192
02:01:35,820 --> 02:01:38,780
The Twitch desktop app will be shut down on April 30th.

2193
02:01:38,780 --> 02:01:42,860
We've made the difficult decision to say goodbye to the Twitch desktop app on April 30th.

2194
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:46,940
This decision was not made lightly and came from a combination of usage and user feedback.

2195
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:51,900
This move allows us to invest more heavily in enhancing and adding new ways to engage

2196
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,820
with the creators and communities you care about.

2197
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:54,880
Hmm.

2198
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:58,620
If you're used to using the Twitch desktop app,

2199
02:01:58,620 --> 02:02:02,940
we recommend bookmarking Twitch TV in your browser of choice for easy access.

2200
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:09,740
But what, what happens to the library of games?

2201
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:11,740
I have like a shit ton of Neo Geo games.

2202
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:14,780
They gave away like 30 Neo Geo games once on there.

2203
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:16,940
I'm a shit ton.

2204
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:20,220
And I think that they're like, you can redeem like whenever, so.

2205
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:20,720
Yeah.

2206
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:23,360
So I'm curious where those end up going.

2207
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,000
So we'll see.

2208
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:26,260
All right.

2209
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:32,240
Well, I guess if there's no other comments and no other thoughts, we will move to wrap

2210
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:35,200
up tonight's show around the two hour mark, but that's all right.

2211
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:40,080
Um, I guess it was a lighter week with, uh, me being out of town and April fool's day

2212
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,320
kind of gets in the way of the real news for a day.

2213
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,920
So it is what it is.

2214
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:47,120
Um, but thank you of course, everybody for being here tonight.

2215
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:50,480
Uh, we always appreciate your support here at orange lounge radio.

2216
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:54,080
Um, if you enjoyed the show, uh, help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about

2217
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:57,680
the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't

2218
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:00,480
here on air, we can't get them out there.

2219
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:07,040
Um, a nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, Google, wherever you found this show a nice

2220
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:09,760
five star review on the platform and social media shares.

2221
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:11,440
They go an awful long way.

2222
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:13,680
So we really appreciate everyone that does that.

2223
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:16,320
Um, yeah, I don't, I don't know what else to say.

2224
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:17,600
Thank you so much for being here.

2225
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:19,360
We'll do it again next week.

2226
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:22,800
It's time to get everybody's final thoughts and dark Sakura.

2227
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:25,280
I see you setting up ready to go with your post-show.

2228
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:27,040
So what's your final thought tonight?

2229
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:28,640
I need chocolate.

2230
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:36,320
Also, also, also I am 56 followers away from 500 and I'm so excited.

2231
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,200
Oh, good luck with that.

2232
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:38,640
I know you've been pushing to get that.

2233
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:44,080
It's, it's tough because it's like, it's, it's hard to, you know, get people to like

2234
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:48,000
follow me cause I'm close, you know, it's hard to do that, but you just have to kind

2235
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,880
of keep the pedal to the metal and hope it sticks.

2236
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,080
So, yeah.

2237
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:57,280
And I mean, it's just a number really, but something like that for me, having been back

2238
02:03:57,280 --> 02:04:00,960
into doing this for a year, it, it's definitely something that would mean a lot to me.

2239
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:07,280
Um, especially by my birthday, but I've, I'm, I'm putting a lot of work into this upcoming

2240
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:11,760
marathon and, you know, I, I mostly, it's not like I even care about the subs as much.

2241
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:16,880
I just want to have my friends around for a virtual birthday party and just, you know,

2242
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:18,720
kill salty survivors.

2243
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:19,780
All right.

2244
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,040
Well, good luck.

2245
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:21,520
Have fun.

2246
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:26,080
And we'll see you killing salty survivors in a minute here after OLR live on Twitch.

2247
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:26,800
So have a good night.

2248
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:28,160
Later tater.

2249
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:28,480
All right.

2250
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:29,680
We'll go to Loki.

2251
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:30,720
Your final thought tonight.

2252
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:36,480
So my final thought is in order to access your Twitch games that you have through prime

2253
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,880
gaming, you have to get the Amazon gaming app.

2254
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,920
Aha.

2255
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:40,160
Okay.

2256
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:41,360
So there is another app.

2257
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:41,840
Interesting.

2258
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:42,560
Yeah.

2259
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:42,960
All right.

2260
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,680
Um, well, that's too bad.

2261
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:48,160
Um, let's see my final thought.

2262
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:49,440
I don't know if I have a lot.

2263
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:52,240
I didn't stream at all last week cause I was gone for half of it.

2264
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:56,240
So I hope to do some streaming this week of, um, I don't know what I'll play, but I'll

2265
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:58,480
find some, I'll find something.

2266
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:02,240
There's, there's always lots of games to catch up on many things I need to play.

2267
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:04,080
So I will try to get on that.

2268
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:06,720
Otherwise I was very thankful to have a break.

2269
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:09,840
Uh, from, from, well, I mean, work is fine.

2270
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:14,400
I don't, but it's, even if you love your job, it's just nice to get a little break from

2271
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:18,800
that routine and just do something silly with my husband, which is exactly what we

2272
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:19,920
did and just.

2273
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:25,360
Go to, he had never been to Vegas before, so it was nice to take him to a new place

2274
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:26,560
and eat some good food.

2275
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,800
We got to Loki.

2276
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:33,440
We got to go to Benihana because they don't have one here and you know, my rule, I don't

2277
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:34,880
go to, I don't go to restaurants.

2278
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,480
I can eat at home when I'm on vacation.

2279
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:39,120
However, I no longer can eat Benihana at home.

2280
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:39,760
So we had to go.

2281
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:42,880
There's a teppanyaki place that's better than Benihana is in Roseville.

2282
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:44,560
Now it's over by the hobby lobby.

2283
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,120
No, I didn't know.

2284
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:45,760
You got to go there.

2285
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:46,820
Yeah.

2286
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:50,480
I know that that hobby lobby, I grew up in that area.

2287
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:54,320
I, and that used to be a Mervyn's back in the day.

2288
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:58,880
Cause my, and I know that place very well because every Sunday my mom went to Mervyn's

2289
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:01,040
and it was definitely the open, open, open thing.

2290
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:07,920
Um, yeah, it's in Japan, something or other, but like we went there once and Oh, so good.

2291
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:08,320
Okay.

2292
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,640
Like it is actually better than Benihana legit.

2293
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:13,520
Alan and I are going to try it cause we love those places.

2294
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:15,360
So yeah, it's really good.

2295
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:19,600
Like everything, just like all of the food was just so well seasoned.

2296
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:20,720
It was just so good.

2297
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:22,560
Um, yeah.

2298
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,120
And, uh, pot culture says he had never been to Vegas.

2299
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:25,600
Nope.

2300
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:31,840
Every time I had been previously, I went to like three final fantasy 14 conventions,

2301
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:32,960
but he didn't really play.

2302
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:33,520
He didn't care.

2303
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:37,200
That was something I kind of did either with Shane or other friends or whatever.

2304
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:41,840
Uh, and then, um, I went there once with, uh, one of my gal pals, melody in the Bay

2305
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:42,400
area.

2306
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:47,120
Um, and we went and saw Gwen Stefani and that was just something where it was a girls weekend.

2307
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:48,640
So, yeah.

2308
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:49,760
So anyway.

2309
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:50,400
All right.

2310
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:55,360
Well, I hope you all have a fantastic week and eat some great food and we'll see you

2311
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:57,520

2312
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:58,960
