WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.280
Oculus dev kits come out, kick starting the modern VR movement. Facebook buys Oculus.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.920
Oculus requires a Facebook login, but that's okay because everybody has a Facebook account.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.440
You can't play Oculus games if Facebook is down, but that's okay because that will never

00:23.440 --> 00:28.560
happen, nor will people ever have local problems that makes Facebook unreachable. The Oculus

00:28.560 --> 00:33.840
Quest is going to be renamed the Meta Quest and now there's a problem.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.640
This is my old man YelsicloudUpdate, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers

00:37.640 --> 00:40.840
and Loki to tell you actual details about this headline and the rest of the week's gaming

00:40.840 --> 00:43.920
news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:43.920 --> 00:52.560
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:52.560 --> 00:59.760
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

00:59.760 --> 01:08.160
number 901 of our show for tonight, January the 30th of 2022. I cannot believe the first

01:08.160 --> 01:14.080
month of the year is almost over and I feel like I've done nothing with this year. But I've done

01:14.080 --> 01:18.400
these shows week in and week out with my co-host, so say hello first off. I'm Rob Roberts and say

01:18.400 --> 01:21.520
hello to my co-host over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.120
Sup.

01:23.120 --> 01:23.760
Hi, how are you?

01:24.880 --> 01:29.920
I am okay for not a lot of sleep. I'm remarkably perky.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.920
Good, good. I'm glad you're doing well.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.920
Remarkably perky for me.

01:33.920 --> 01:37.680
You and I were talking about animated emotes on Twitch in chat a minute ago. Yeah,

01:37.680 --> 01:40.880
a lot of streamers are getting access to that now and I didn't even realize

01:41.520 --> 01:43.840
Twitch had built in their own animated thing.

01:44.480 --> 01:49.840
I've actually had slots for five animated emotes for like the last four months.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.320
I think I just finally got around to doing something with it.

01:56.480 --> 02:01.280
But I took my boop pig emote and I animated it.

02:01.920 --> 02:06.560
Yeah, I see it in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

02:06.560 --> 02:10.160
nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,

02:10.160 --> 02:14.560
twitch.tv slash v o g network. And yes, I see all sorts of emotes in chat.

02:14.560 --> 02:19.040
I see this cute little dog pounding thing that you guys from losing color.

02:19.040 --> 02:25.040
And I need to see about if I had the money, I would absolutely commission Kabuchi.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.000
Yeah, who is absolutely amazing.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.040
But as it is, I'm poor and I have to figure out how to do this on my own.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.840
And usually the very talented ones have a list a mile long because word gets out that they're

02:37.840 --> 02:43.920
talented. And so you got to wait, right? So Kabuchi charges, but the work is worth the money.

02:43.920 --> 02:49.760
Of course, if I had if I had it, I would pay it. I don't have it. So I have to contend with my own

02:49.760 --> 02:57.760
little crazy pixelated. You know, boop on the nose, same, same for me, public, public access,

02:57.760 --> 03:06.240
public domain vector art and snag it together. I know I've done some to myself, but, you know,

03:06.240 --> 03:10.720
I have to I have to really kind of it's a hodgepodge. I might as well use MS Paint,

03:10.720 --> 03:15.520
that's for sure. I don't know what he's made in MS Paint lately, but say hello to tech master Loki.

03:17.360 --> 03:20.000
Yeah, it's all I'm all smeary today, apparently.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.040
What were you painting?

03:22.080 --> 03:26.560
No, no, no, it's just my camera's all fuzzy for some reason. I was trying to figure out why.

03:26.560 --> 03:31.600
I know this is gonna sound silly, but turn it off and on again. No, seriously, because I have a

03:31.600 --> 03:36.720
weird problem with Discord. So I do the call with Bobby Blackwolf. And for some reason on, you know,

03:36.720 --> 03:40.640
because he has the show and I do the call, like the little tease call on the at the end of his

03:40.640 --> 03:46.960
show. And for some reason, Discord forces my camera into the lowest resolution. I don't know

03:46.960 --> 03:54.800
why. And so to get it to work, I have to like stop it in OBS and then start it again, which is so

03:54.800 --> 03:58.400
weird. But it is what it is. I don't know why that is. So

03:59.200 --> 04:02.320
but it just picked the perfect scene. It's like even more blurry.

04:03.200 --> 04:10.240
It just got fuzzier. Yeah. So who cares? It's fine. Well, I'm sick, so that's fun.

04:10.880 --> 04:15.280
Oh, no, it's not the it's not the core. It's not the big one, is it?

04:15.280 --> 04:17.600
Do you use your government tests?

04:18.320 --> 04:23.360
I will. Our ones from school. But yes, yes, these are tests. And OK, it's not that it's just it's

04:23.360 --> 04:28.880
another fun, you know, sore throat fever virus. Sinus infection?

04:29.840 --> 04:34.320
I don't know, but it's fun. Everything's going around, not just the big one,

04:34.320 --> 04:39.760
but everything is going. I had I had a scare on the big sea after the last episode of our.

04:39.760 --> 04:46.320
I found out, you know, how I did that Twin Peaks event. Well, sure enough, one of the actresses

04:46.320 --> 04:52.000
from the show posted to her Instagram that she was sick with. You know what? And I was like,

04:52.000 --> 04:57.360
this this is how I get covid. This is, you know, that would be a fun story.

04:57.360 --> 05:02.720
At least Palmer gives. Well, it was it was the other one. I'm not trying to name names.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.400
I'm not trying to name names or shame anyone. That's why I'm not being as specific. You know,

05:06.400 --> 05:11.440
you stealth folks can figure it out. But, you know, I'm sorry to hear that she got it.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.960
But you're right. It would have been not not that catching covid is funny at all,

05:14.960 --> 05:19.600
because many people have died from it. However, let's look at the fact that, yes, it would have

05:19.600 --> 05:25.120
made for a very interesting party story five, five years from now. And I'm vaccinated, boosted.

05:25.120 --> 05:30.560
So, you know, if I had gone through a week of hell, then, you know, I at least I would be OK.

05:31.360 --> 05:37.360
But but it turns out I use I use my government tests to find out that I actually know it was

05:37.360 --> 05:45.280
my Wario 64 tests because, you know, Wario 64, the person on Twitter that posts all the video

05:45.280 --> 05:50.400
game deals and sales and things like that. Well, out of the blue one day where, you know,

05:50.400 --> 05:55.200
this is how this is how that person makes money, affiliate links to all the Amazon things that

05:55.200 --> 05:59.200
they're posting about and every all those websites that they are. Y'all are giving Wario a ton of

05:59.200 --> 06:02.800
money, but it's fine. I mean, some would say they're doing a public service, never in the

06:02.800 --> 06:08.960
money. Well, out of the blue, Wario posts a link to Amazon. Hey, Amazon has the covid test in stock.

06:08.960 --> 06:14.080
Get them now. And it was one of those odd moments where it's like, OK, the dude who

06:14.960 --> 06:22.000
gives me links to sales on video games ends up being the one to finally let me find a covid test.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.280
And sure enough, I got my Wario 64 covid test. So that was one of the ones I took when I found out

06:27.920 --> 06:32.880
not Laura Palmer exposed me to covid and I was negative. Thank you very much. But I was like,

06:32.880 --> 06:39.040
oh, no, I have a sore throat. Is this it? But I got a bunch of tests from work and they actually

06:39.120 --> 06:45.760
before you can go in the building if you're not like they have you test once a week if you're

06:45.760 --> 06:51.360
vaccinated and if you're not, you have to test every day before you can come into the office.

06:51.920 --> 07:00.400
So because I'm not an onsite technically employee right now, they made me take a rapid test. It's

07:00.400 --> 07:04.400
the first time I've done one of them. And like it came my results came through like right away,

07:04.400 --> 07:10.240
but like you got to be 15 minutes like fine. And of course, it was negative. And I got to go in

07:10.240 --> 07:16.800
and see some of my coworkers and and say hi and get the good coffee that they have at work. Oh,

07:16.800 --> 07:22.160
my God, I miss the work coffee so much. Not like the coffee machines that they, you know,

07:22.160 --> 07:28.080
grind it and brew it, you know, all of that there. But like we have like a coffee cart thing. And

07:28.640 --> 07:33.200
oh, so good. You know what else is only good from carts? Churros, just saying.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.720
Or in the fashion district in Los Angeles. I don't I don't know if it's the gamer in me or

07:40.720 --> 07:45.440
what, but I actually thought the at home covid test was kind of fun. It was like a little at

07:45.440 --> 07:50.880
home chemistry kit. It's like, you know, let's put six drops in here, put this thing in here.

07:50.880 --> 07:54.320
Oh, you got to follow the IQ instructions. OK, I was like, oh, this is kind of fun.

07:54.320 --> 07:58.800
Actually, Rob, what you now know kind of what it's like to do a pregnancy test.

08:00.160 --> 08:04.640
There was I haven't taken one before for fun. I'm just kidding. But yes, I'm sure they're similar.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.640
Except, you know, it's up your nose instead of pee.

08:10.560 --> 08:15.200
All right. I'm going to chat over at Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.880
Did your mom says Wario 64 is the reason why I have a ton of video games.

08:18.960 --> 08:22.960
Graduation, Rob, your nose is pregnant. No, not pregnant.

08:26.480 --> 08:30.720
Let's see. Jaskarine says, what? I love Rob's Olar shirt. Thank you.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.440
Unfortunately, these were only available for a limited time

08:34.080 --> 08:39.840
because we had the store on an old Web site and we no longer use that Web site.

08:39.840 --> 08:44.080
So that just says we've got to get a new store up and running. So I'm sorry. I've

08:44.080 --> 08:47.840
personally been very distracted with my big move coming up, so it hasn't really been a priority.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.360
But we've got to make that happen because Jaskarine wants a shirt. And I'm sure there's

08:51.360 --> 08:54.480
more people out there. And for those on the podcast feed, I'm wearing an orange,

08:54.480 --> 08:58.880
but well, dark soccer design this. It's Orange Lodge Radio, but it's in like a Sega style font,

08:58.880 --> 09:02.000
inspired font, let's say. And it looks like you. I like it.

09:03.680 --> 09:11.120
For the record, I do have all of my original designs and just make an account and I'll

09:11.120 --> 09:15.120
get you the stuff. We've got to open up a store front and throw it all up there. We'll get to

09:15.120 --> 09:21.760
that. I have my own store and it has been. It's really, really easy to do stuff on it.

09:22.480 --> 09:27.920
Nice. Let's see other comments and chat here. Bobby Blackwell says my favorite thing is that

09:27.920 --> 09:33.280
nobody knows who Oreo 64 actually is in terms of is it one person or is it multiple people?

09:33.280 --> 09:39.040
It reminds me of Sushi X from back in the day. No, nobody. I mean, we know now, but we didn't

09:39.040 --> 09:43.920
know then, you know, back in that for those old time gamers like me who used to get excited about

09:43.920 --> 09:49.760
a new month of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine available in stores. You get all excited about

09:49.760 --> 09:54.240
those and you never knew who Sushi X was, but we found out years later it was a variety of

09:54.240 --> 09:59.200
different people, if I'm not mistaken. It's kind of a mantle that was passed along, if I recall

09:59.200 --> 10:05.680
correctly. So anyway, let's get into some more gaming and get into our kickoff topic tonight.

10:05.680 --> 10:12.400
I hate that we're here. We go again with another NFT story. It's just like, God, it just won't

10:12.400 --> 10:17.520
stop. But the reason why we keep bringing it up is because the industry keeps bringing it up

10:17.520 --> 10:22.160
and people ask the industry people about it. And that's exactly what's going on this week.

10:22.160 --> 10:25.680
Loki, I don't know if you would would mind taking us away tonight with this

10:26.800 --> 10:32.080
and our latest update from executives versus the rest of us on NFTs.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.800
Because every time that an executive said, no, listen, you just don't understand

10:37.360 --> 10:43.440
why this is important. You just don't you just don't get it. That's always worked out for them

10:43.440 --> 10:50.160
all the time. Like, I mean, just ask Microsoft how the original Xbox One launch or pitch was going.

10:52.000 --> 11:01.760
So because people don't like NFTs and there's been a lot of backlash that they had made some

11:01.760 --> 11:07.200
comments regarding it, basically saying that I think gamers don't get what a digital secondary

11:07.200 --> 11:12.560
market can bring them for now, because the current situation of context of NFTs, gamers really

11:12.560 --> 11:20.000
believe it's destroying the planet. And second, a tool for just speculation. But what we at Ubisoft

11:20.000 --> 11:25.760
are seeing is the first or team first is the end game. The end game is about giving players

11:25.760 --> 11:30.320
opportunity to resell their items once they're finished with them or they're finished playing

11:30.320 --> 11:37.520
the game itself. Now, way to like totally not address anybody's concerns on that. It's like,

11:37.520 --> 11:42.160
I don't I still don't understand with like the block chain stuff like I get

11:43.200 --> 11:47.520
with these digits you're talking about. They're just items with numbers on them,

11:47.520 --> 11:59.280
which is no big deal. But. Diem is managing a whole host of digital items without block chain,

11:59.280 --> 12:06.000
like why do we need to incorporate block chain technology into this?

12:06.960 --> 12:11.120
If you want to talk about speculative market, I mean, all that stuff that's on their digital

12:11.120 --> 12:17.520
marketplace is pretty much speculative. I just think it's stupid. And it's also just like.

12:18.640 --> 12:25.200
Why I like what's the point like. I just won't buy it like I won't play your stupid game like

12:26.160 --> 12:29.360
I don't get the point. And even still, like on top of that, like,

12:30.240 --> 12:34.800
let's say that, you know, there's an item that you can sell.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.920
Does it mean you're going to have a buyer for that item? Like, that's the thing is

12:39.920 --> 12:44.800
they're talking about like, oh, yeah, you can you can sell it later. Well, like,

12:44.800 --> 12:49.680
what if no one wants to buy that piece of garbage? Exactly. That'd be like saying, you know,

12:50.560 --> 12:57.040
hey, guess what? You can sell your old like Madden players, you know, for Madden 05 or something like

12:57.040 --> 13:01.120
that. It's like, yeah, but no one plays that anymore. You know, that's the thing is people

13:01.120 --> 13:07.680
move on. So. I think it's just a big waste. I think it's just if there anything, the reason

13:07.680 --> 13:13.760
why they want to do this and they really could, like I said, do this without NFTs is they want

13:13.760 --> 13:19.360
a piece of that transaction cost for processing the transaction for the buying in the selling of

13:19.760 --> 13:24.960
whatever digital item it is they want to double, triple, quadruple dip on this stuff.

13:24.960 --> 13:30.560
But like I said, team does this already with their digital items that they have on their

13:30.560 --> 13:35.760
storefront. And they're like, not even things you can technically use for us. Sometimes it's

13:35.760 --> 13:43.680
like training cards or a picture of a pickle or something like that. It literally has no utility,

13:43.680 --> 13:50.320
but people are being speculative with it and they still take a cut of that on the marketplace. Like

13:50.320 --> 13:56.320
you can do that without NFT. The NFT stuff, all that does is allows it to occur outside

13:56.320 --> 14:01.120
the platform, which is really completely unnecessary. That's one of the other things

14:01.120 --> 14:05.440
I'm not understanding about NFTs is that so many of them I've seen are so damn ugly.

14:05.440 --> 14:11.840
I'm like, who, who wants that now? A lot of that stuff is procedurally generated,

14:12.080 --> 14:16.080
especially like those, the Board Ape Yacht Club. I don't know what the hell it's called.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.680
Sorry. I know Jamie wanted to jump in, but I just wanted to say really quick,

14:19.680 --> 14:24.320
like there's a very popular, I'm just going to say, I'm not going to say who they are

14:24.320 --> 14:28.320
because I'm not giving them free advertising because this company advertises on every podcast

14:28.320 --> 14:35.200
except ours, but it is a very popular site to buy underwear. And I recently actually used this site

14:35.200 --> 14:41.360
and I will say it's expensive as fuck, but it's actually probably some of the best underwear I've

14:41.440 --> 14:46.800
had actually, but they posted on this NFT bandwagon thing. And it's one of those like

14:46.800 --> 14:51.520
ugly ass monkeys that I don't understand. And so many people are like canceling my sub,

14:51.520 --> 14:57.040
done with you, done with this. And I'm like, what this, this website, as far as I know,

14:57.040 --> 15:02.640
had a really good thing going. Why are they throwing it away for a stupid monkey?

15:02.640 --> 15:08.080
That an ugly monkey piece of art. I don't understand. I especially don't understand how an

15:08.080 --> 15:12.480
underwear company gets into NFTs, but I mean, that's, I know I'm getting away from video games,

15:12.480 --> 15:15.520
but it's just money that you can burn and like, look at we're current.

15:16.640 --> 15:22.160
But it just screams to me. It's an investor thing that somebody sat those people down in a room and

15:22.160 --> 15:26.000
said, this is cool. This is where it's going. Anyway. I'm sorry, dark soccer. I know you're

15:26.000 --> 15:33.040
trying to jump in. I was just saying maybe, maybe I should make an NFT that says dark soccer. I made

15:33.040 --> 15:38.560
this NFT. Give me a dollar. No, don't, don't buy into it. Don't just don't. But I know,

15:39.520 --> 15:46.560
but it would be fun to like make a parody and use their tactics to prove how stupid their tactics

15:46.560 --> 15:53.440
are. Um, Bobby Black, I've made exactly a dollar. Bobby Black open chat says the best analogy is

15:53.440 --> 15:57.920
that old buy a star campaign that was around as a kid. People would buy a name, a star after a

15:57.920 --> 16:02.560
family member, that star was now yours. You got a certificate that company went under no one else

16:02.560 --> 16:08.560
recognizes that you own the star or that you named the star. Exactly. You can buy it by a

16:08.560 --> 16:15.680
title. You could be a lot, a Lord or a lady. Uh, it's just, and, and with no actual landowning

16:15.680 --> 16:21.440
rights. The interesting thing that's happened for me in the past week is that I've seen people

16:21.440 --> 16:27.520
that I consider to be intelligent people making pro NFT arguments and trying to actually state

16:27.520 --> 16:33.520
what the reasons are for this. Um, I'm not convinced, but I thought because, well,

16:33.520 --> 16:38.720
here was the argument that I saw where at least it, at least it wasn't somebody just screaming at

16:38.720 --> 16:42.240
somebody on Twitter. You're an idiot. You don't understand. You're missing out. You're missing.

16:42.240 --> 16:47.360
At least I saw somebody say something that was like an actual thought that was a thought. I just,

16:47.360 --> 16:51.760
I disagree with the conclusion, but the conclusion was essentially like, well,

16:52.400 --> 16:59.680
you buy things in marketplaces all the time in games and essentially the marketplace owns those.

16:59.680 --> 17:04.240
Well, what if you could go to a decentralized place where those things were owned? I want

17:04.240 --> 17:08.240
to point out, cause I know somebody already typing in chat. I know the Ubisoft thing. Yes,

17:08.240 --> 17:11.680
Ubisoft still has it. The comment I read was not in response to this Ubisoft thing.

17:12.240 --> 17:18.000
And that was the argument. But to me there, I have two problems with that. Number one,

17:18.080 --> 17:22.160
it still doesn't show that those items have any value, especially in video gaming.

17:22.160 --> 17:28.960
I think we've seen that there is so much supply and not enough demand. Anytime these things get

17:28.960 --> 17:34.000
opened up, especially like the Diablo three real money auction houses is because all of these bots

17:34.000 --> 17:41.040
from countries around the world will get in and try to try to screw over Americans and other

17:41.040 --> 17:47.440
global people that will get this. And the surprise was very, very few people were buying. And my

17:47.440 --> 17:51.680
other, sorry, just real quickly, my other point with to, to kind of counter the, you know what,

17:51.680 --> 17:55.360
otherwise, you know, I consider this person to be intelligent. I'm glad they're actually

17:55.360 --> 18:02.800
having a real debate about it, but, um, the whole, um, fact that, um, uh, even if it's decentralized

18:02.800 --> 18:08.880
to me, that actually opens it up to exploitation. How much have we heard about that? Bitcoin's

18:08.880 --> 18:14.640
getting stolen. Crypto is, is like a big on the, uh, on the dark sides of the web and all this

18:14.640 --> 18:20.480
stuff. Like it's, it's, uh, it's a wild West and in some ways I'm actually like, maybe

18:20.480 --> 18:26.080
decentralization actually isn't good for some of these things. Anyway, Loki, I'm sorry, your point.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.880
No, I was just basically going to say that I don't think we're going to have necessarily a problem

18:30.880 --> 18:36.800
with bots snatching these up. However, um, it does allow the opportunity to make some of the

18:36.800 --> 18:43.920
digital artificially scarce to drive up the price. Um, it's also just a big waste of the time. Like

18:43.920 --> 18:51.200
once again, like we have cosmetics for video games have gotten to a point where they are

18:51.200 --> 18:56.880
ridiculously expensive for certain things like a whole skin, you know, might be $20 to change

18:56.880 --> 19:03.040
it to like blue or something. And now you're talking about, Oh, Hey, let's drive that price

19:03.040 --> 19:09.040
up even more. Like, I just don't care. Like, I don't think that it would, it would make sense.

19:09.040 --> 19:17.040
The only way that this would actually work is like, say you had some unified platform where,

19:17.760 --> 19:24.720
you know, I can create a skin for some avatar and be able to use it across like a bunch of

19:24.720 --> 19:31.200
different games from a bunch of different publishers, you know, um, or I, you know,

19:31.200 --> 19:37.600
another good example would be like, say if you know, Sony were to sell all of their digital games,

19:37.600 --> 19:45.440
like an NFT. So if it could create a secondary market for the digital games that you could go

19:45.440 --> 19:50.320
and then resell that later on when you're done playing that game, that would be something,

19:50.320 --> 19:55.040
but they're not going to do that because that devalues their stuff and they want,

19:55.040 --> 20:03.200
you know, to drive the price up. I just, I just don't see this being done in a meaningful way.

20:03.200 --> 20:09.520
And so far what we've seen these game companies use NFTs for is not a meaningful thing. Like,

20:09.520 --> 20:15.360
yeah. Ooh, it's a helmet with a number on it. Are you ever going to be able to see that number on

20:15.360 --> 20:19.760
that helmet when you're running around shooting people? No, you're not going to stop there and

20:19.760 --> 20:24.640
go, wow, you have a number one helmet. No one cares. No one is going to care.

20:25.200 --> 20:29.920
You, you, I think a part of what you said really hits the nail on the head.

20:29.920 --> 20:35.680
Like, is that this is not the way to convince people to get NFTs ugly ass fucking procedurally

20:35.680 --> 20:40.080
generated monkey art is not the way to convince people stealing other people's art, not the way

20:40.080 --> 20:44.720
to convince people that NFTs are yet. Now, when you talk about these types of things that like,

20:45.280 --> 20:50.240
if I make a design, like maybe something that is like, let's say, let's say, I don't know,

20:50.240 --> 20:55.520
like the VOG logo or something that, you know, we, we, you know, have here at VOG and maybe we

20:55.520 --> 21:00.560
can take that and put it on in game stuff and we can move that from game to game and things like

21:00.560 --> 21:06.480
that. Like there's something there where I'm like, that seems a little more interesting, but I just

21:06.480 --> 21:13.120
like, I don't feel that you necessarily need the blockchain's involvement for that. It just takes

21:13.120 --> 21:17.520
the right strategic partnerships with companies to make that happen. And then it would actually

21:17.520 --> 21:21.760
be regulated, which I actually think at the end of the day is probably a good thing.

21:21.760 --> 21:30.560
Yeah. And a lot of times with NFTs now, nowadays, it's just, you own the link to that piece of art,

21:31.280 --> 21:38.080
which they can just take it offline too. And that's happened. So it's, it's, it's stupid.

21:41.280 --> 21:46.240
Jason in chat says, by the way, great voiceover work tonight, Jason says a value is subcultural

21:46.240 --> 21:50.800
niche. NFTs being hype is trying to astroturf that into the mainstream for various reasons.

21:50.800 --> 21:55.200
Oh, astroturf it. I love that. Two highly valuable things in Rocket League that mean

21:55.200 --> 22:00.240
nothing to a non-player, white zombas and alpha boost. A lot of the problem is the mainstream

22:00.240 --> 22:04.800
nature of it more than the thing itself. Well, let's go, let's go back to the comment. And,

22:04.800 --> 22:09.920
and this is the other thing that gets me is these executives that are fucking clueless,

22:09.920 --> 22:17.040
that I get paid millions of dollars to be fucking morons that just dig their heels in on this stuff

22:17.040 --> 22:22.000
and to, to make a claim like, you know, oh, gamers just don't want NFTs cause they don't

22:22.000 --> 22:28.800
get it. Yeah. We don't get why you keep shoving it down our throat. Like stop, you know, let it

22:28.800 --> 22:35.040
be the niche thing that it is. Is I, I, I, how these folks stay. And of course it's coming from

22:35.040 --> 22:39.760
Ubisoft, a company that's got all of that's all sorts of issues up and down anyway. So

22:39.760 --> 22:49.200
Ubisoft's getting bought by someone for the years over. Just wait, just wait. All right. Let's move

22:49.200 --> 22:53.280
on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week. Dark

22:53.280 --> 22:59.840
Sakura, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week? Um, well, as I was saying, um, before the

22:59.840 --> 23:06.640
show, I, and I mentioned this last week that I had been redoing my windows 11 on, on, uh,

23:06.640 --> 23:13.680
for arm on parallels. Um, I got Mass Effect installed. I tried to run the first game.

23:14.400 --> 23:20.160
No, it just would stop. It would go right back to the launcher. So on a whim I tried Mass Effect 2,

23:20.160 --> 23:28.960
it loaded just fine. So did Mass Effect 3. So I had to go haul my ass to find a gibbed editor that

23:28.960 --> 23:34.480
will work. So I'm going to start a game for Mass Effect 2, then cancel out of the game, modify my

23:34.480 --> 23:46.080
save file. Um, and then I can start Mass Effect 2 the way I want to. Um, but I, I don't know what

23:46.080 --> 23:52.800
it is, but I think the emulation is getting a lot better. Um, it's, I, I still had trouble with VHS,

23:53.440 --> 24:01.920
which I might do the next update and try VHS again. So we'll see. But, um, a, a mutual streamer

24:01.920 --> 24:12.320
friend of ours, uh, made use of my VHS and did not care for it that much. Hmm. So, um, anyway,

24:12.320 --> 24:18.160
um, I, of course I have played Dead by Daylight right now as the lunar event, lunar new year event.

24:18.960 --> 24:24.160
Um, if you log in every day, you get 50,000 blood points every day, which is nice. Um,

24:24.880 --> 24:31.120
I have decided to also, uh, try to P350 my Freddy first out of, out of just pure,

24:32.000 --> 24:36.640
I don't know, reasons. I don't know why people don't like Freddy. Freddy's awesome.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.600
They don't like playing against Freddy. That's what it is.

24:41.040 --> 24:44.800
And the thing is like, people are like, oh, Freddy got, Freddy's still freaking strong,

24:44.800 --> 24:50.480
no matter how much they have nerfed him, a good Freddy player will nail you. End of story. Um,

24:51.200 --> 24:59.520
I have also played a little bit of demons tilt because that game is fun. I picked up the Apple

24:59.520 --> 25:06.480
arcade version of Zen pinball. Um, cause it has theater of magic and a few other tables that I

25:06.480 --> 25:11.200
like on it. And I own a theater of magic, but I would like to stream a theater of magic as well.

25:11.200 --> 25:19.760
So now I can do both. Um, uh, I played, uh, of course I've had, you know, freaking word scapes

25:19.760 --> 25:28.240
cause it's great. And I started playing, um, uh, Marvel contest of champions on my iPhone

25:29.040 --> 25:34.320
and I don't know, but it's kind of fun. It's just like a little silly fighting game.

25:36.160 --> 25:41.760
And one of these days I'll get like characters. I actually like, even though they're random

25:43.200 --> 25:49.040
and I think that's about it. All right. Yeah. We'll go to Loki and your gaming week.

25:50.240 --> 25:56.560
Um, I did play more than one thing this week, so, um, I, I was feeling pretty brain dead

25:56.560 --> 26:03.360
earlier today, so I jumped back into, um, power washing simulator. Oh, good. That's always a nice

26:03.360 --> 26:08.400
relaxing game. Yeah. Yeah. A little too much though. It actually almost put me asleep. So I,

26:10.000 --> 26:16.240
uh, I had to stop playing it after a while, but, uh, I was washing a carousel. So that's

26:16.240 --> 26:22.320
the level I was on for that. Um, and then of course more Minecraft, obviously. Um,

26:22.320 --> 26:27.840
I put out my new episode this morning, so that's out there now. My, uh, starter base,

26:27.840 --> 26:33.400
which is enormous. So now I got to top that. That's going to be a lot of blandy. Um,

26:34.960 --> 26:39.840
yeah, it's pretty much that was pretty much it. I didn't play a whole ton this week. Cause like

26:39.840 --> 26:47.120
I said, I haven't been feeling well the last few days. Um, but probably more Minecraft this week.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.840
Hey, at least you got a video posted. You keep keeping that going. That's good.

26:51.840 --> 26:57.920
So yeah. Everyone check that out on YouTube at Loki. Um, so my gaming week, I actually played

26:57.920 --> 27:02.880
a lot this week. Um, yeah, I played some of my usuals, uh, continued on final fantasy 14,

27:02.880 --> 27:06.880
of course. Cause you know, y'all know, I love that working on leveling my dancer and my white

27:06.880 --> 27:11.280
mage, just depending on what I feel like playing that day as I, I work on my new quest to get all

27:11.280 --> 27:16.480
my jobs to 90, uh, to go with this expansion. Cause why not? Uh, and then I've also been playing

27:16.480 --> 27:20.480
dead by daylight as well. Probably not as much as dark soccer, but a little bit. Uh, I'm working,

27:20.480 --> 27:24.640
I'm actually my first P three 50 is going to probably be Cheryl. Um, cause she's already

27:24.640 --> 27:29.360
the P three part. And now I think she's up to like level 46 and you get a decent amount of blood

27:29.360 --> 27:35.360
points from this event. So, um, the only thing that ticks me off is I can't get borrowed time

27:35.360 --> 27:40.000
to show up on her fucking blood web. And that is when you solo queue, that talent is so needed.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.760
It wasn't, it was on there not long ago. No, no, no. I I'm not trying to seek her. So I mean like

27:45.760 --> 27:50.560
showing up in your blood web to get it. I can't get it. So it's just, you know what the new thing

27:50.560 --> 27:57.360
is right now, right? Hmm. What's that? Like flip flop. Oh, boil over in that whole thing. Yeah.

27:57.600 --> 28:05.040
Yeah. I'm like, all I've just been doing is bringing when I'm not doing the, the calendar,

28:05.040 --> 28:10.880
the lunar, uh, envelopes, I'm just bringing whatever shortens the distance between, uh,

28:11.840 --> 28:16.000
uh, hooks. You gotta be careful too. A lot of killers will just let you bleed out. If

28:16.000 --> 28:21.440
you're going to play that game to just mess with killers. So, Oh no, I'm just saying in general,

28:22.240 --> 28:28.320
to the, to the millions of listeners we have out there. It's all been slugfest and honestly,

28:28.320 --> 28:33.600
I don't like to do that to people. Um, unless they've just been, I don't either, but I will.

28:33.600 --> 28:40.320
Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, other games I've been playing, um, uh, let's see. So, uh,

28:40.320 --> 28:46.640
some new stuff. I played Taiko no Tatsujin because that, that just came out. A new version of it came

28:46.640 --> 28:52.560
out on a, I guess it was PC as well as Xbox, but I picked it up on Xbox game pass. Um, and, uh,

28:52.560 --> 28:56.720
I was playing a little bit of it and it's got a, it's got a cute song list. Uh, it has Undertale

28:56.720 --> 29:01.040
music in it, which kind of cracked me up. Uh, it has like a variety of different Namco stuff,

29:01.040 --> 29:04.240
but then like it has the random like Capcom song. Like there was, you know,

29:04.240 --> 29:08.960
Ray you from street fighter five is there. And this was the thing that cracked me the fuck up.

29:08.960 --> 29:12.640
Then they have, you know, they have some J-pop songs. They have some, uh, vocaloid,

29:12.640 --> 29:16.240
like Hatsune Miku sounding songs. They have a pretty decent mix of things. And then they have

29:16.240 --> 29:21.680
pop songs. The most random fucking pop songs are in there. I want you back by the Jackson five.

29:21.680 --> 29:26.400
That's not that, that, that obscure. That's a pop standard. Here's the one that made me laugh.

29:27.200 --> 29:31.840
You're going to lose Whamageddon every time you play this game because last Christmas by Wham

29:31.840 --> 29:37.120
is in the game. Why? I don't know. I don't know, but it's fucking funny. Yeah. It's,

29:37.120 --> 29:41.360
it's very memeable. I don't mind the Whamageddon. I mind the Mariah apocalypse.

29:41.360 --> 29:48.160
Well, Mariah, Mariah, uh, Taiko no Tatujin is Mariah free, but for whatever reason last

29:48.160 --> 29:53.120
Christmas by Wham is there. And that just cracked me the fuck up. So yeah, it's an interesting song

29:53.120 --> 29:57.120
list. Uh, I was having a little problem. Like the timing was throwing me and I didn't even,

29:57.120 --> 30:00.800
I was listening to Bobby show. He went a little more in depth, uh, on Taiko no Tatujin. Cause I

30:00.800 --> 30:06.160
guess it has more issues on PC. Like it won't even play right now. Um, but I, I didn't even

30:06.160 --> 30:09.920
know you could go into a calibration mode. I don't like the interface particularly.

30:09.920 --> 30:14.240
I do remember playing the switch version and the switch one had a better interface than this one.

30:14.240 --> 30:19.600
Um, but this one is with game pass, so I didn't pay anything extra for it.

30:19.600 --> 30:25.440
So that was cool. And it has super easy, uh, achievements. You keep getting five point

30:25.440 --> 30:29.280
achievements, bing, bing, bing, bing, like, like open a menu and you get an achievement.

30:29.280 --> 30:34.880
It's really, really silly. That's for sure. So, um, interesting. Hi Akuma JP is in our chat and

30:34.880 --> 30:39.040
I haven't seen Akuma JP in a long time. It's so good to see you. Um, I know life happens sometimes

30:39.040 --> 30:42.320
you can't make it every week, but it's so good to see you tonight. And Akuma JP says,

30:42.320 --> 30:48.800
Japanese love that song last Christmas. A lot of, a lot of Americans do too, but I think it's become

30:48.800 --> 30:55.680
a me like to put it in perspective, you cannot go into a Dennis office in November or December and

30:55.680 --> 31:01.760
not hear that song. Cause you know, Dennis office always play that smooth rock. It's time for the

31:01.760 --> 31:10.880
smooth mix and now coming up, Kenny G followed by Celine Dion. You know, you know what though?

31:10.880 --> 31:17.760
What I am now going to incorporate last Christmas when I eat my KFC

31:20.320 --> 31:26.560
for Christmas, you should, you should, because I think that the KFC tradition from Japan is the

31:26.560 --> 31:31.760
best tradition ever. Only second to the Jewish tradition of eating Chinese food.

31:33.600 --> 31:38.160
Uh, yes. Uh, both good traditions, but if you want to make playing last Christmas and Taiko

31:38.160 --> 31:42.320
no Tatsujin your new tradition, you sure can. So I played a little bit of that. It's, it's cute,

31:42.320 --> 31:48.640
but I, I didn't play a lot of it because the next day was the release of Pokemon legends,

31:48.640 --> 31:52.720
which I picked up, um, Pokemon that I've been saying Pokemon legends are chaos,

31:52.720 --> 31:58.880
but I guess it's supposed to be Arceus or Arceus. Um, but, um, you know what language is fluid and

31:58.880 --> 32:03.120
I'm saying Arceus because that's what it feels like. You know what these games don't have,

32:03.120 --> 32:07.920
it's 2022 and these games still don't have voice acting. So as far as I'm concerned,

32:07.920 --> 32:12.640
they're leaving it up to us and our imaginations to dream it up. I have to, I would have to look at,

32:12.640 --> 32:18.160
uh, uh, Kana to see how it's supposed to be pronounced there. And that's where they're

32:18.160 --> 32:23.200
getting the Arceus from is, is the original Japanese text. Well, and on top of that,

32:23.200 --> 32:31.600
a C in that respect would typically be a soft C. So it makes sense to me. Yeah. But then again,

32:31.600 --> 32:39.440
people, you know, don't say GIF. I know they say GIF because then the creator, right? So yeah.

32:39.440 --> 32:43.920
So he's a nice, I say it's a GIF, GIF thing. And I also say it really doesn't matter what you call

32:43.920 --> 32:48.960
the game. Um, it's gonna be the same game at the end of the day. And it's, it's actually,

32:48.960 --> 32:53.520
I'm really enjoying it. I'm really, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it, but I did the right thing

32:53.520 --> 32:58.320
and I didn't buy into a lot of the hype. And I find when I do this with games, I always enjoy

32:58.320 --> 33:04.000
it better because that was my secret with No Man's Sky. Remember I, I didn't, I didn't hate No Man's

33:04.000 --> 33:08.800
Sky 1.0. I thought it was a little bare bones, but I didn't hate it because I didn't buy into

33:08.800 --> 33:13.040
the fucking hype. And I did that. And believe me, Shane, Shane would send me text messages quite

33:13.040 --> 33:16.320
frequently with the latest and I would be kind of like, oh, neat, sounds neat, but I didn't really

33:16.320 --> 33:20.480
watch a lot of videos or anything. And I think I'm actually better for it because it made the

33:20.480 --> 33:26.240
experience a lot more like, oh, oh, oh, oh, I wasn't expecting, oh, oh. And that was kind of

33:26.240 --> 33:32.560
like what it's been playing the game so far. Uh, is, uh, it's, it's neat. So yes, a lot of people

33:32.560 --> 33:38.560
are saying that this is like Pokemon meets Breath of the Wild. And I, I absolutely see those

33:38.560 --> 33:44.400
comparisons because they've definitely put in like the crafting, the open world, the multiple

33:44.400 --> 33:49.680
ways to do things. Uh, even some of the, uh, musical cues sound really familiar. And like the,

33:49.680 --> 33:54.800
the interface looks kind of familiar a little bit. I would also say that there's a lot in common

33:54.800 --> 33:59.360
with Pokemon Snap, uh, which is a little more of a deeper cut, I think for some people. But

33:59.360 --> 34:06.080
I think the way that you are encouraged to like the stealth in this game is actually a little

34:06.080 --> 34:11.600
more Pokemon Snap to me, um, in that you have to snap things a certain timing in a certain way,

34:11.600 --> 34:16.880
uh, to really get the max points. And I think there's some of that too in this. Um, but I also

34:16.880 --> 34:21.360
like that they've really changed the concept of the Pokedex because usually with the Pokedex and

34:21.360 --> 34:26.160
the mainline games, you get like half a check for seeing the Pokemon and a full check for catching

34:26.160 --> 34:31.920
the Pokemon. In this game, catch them all isn't good enough. You got to catch them all. You got

34:31.920 --> 34:35.760
to catch them all off guard. You got to use them all to see certain moves. You got to, you got to

34:35.760 --> 34:41.120
do all these different things with it to really master that entry in your Pokedex. Now you only

34:41.120 --> 34:47.440
have to get so many, like you don't have to like catch 50 of each Pokemon just to check off the

34:47.440 --> 34:52.480
Dex entry. It gives it to you at a pretty low number, but you have to do more than just catch

34:52.480 --> 34:56.640
it. And I think that's interesting because it's really been encouraging me to rotate my team more

34:56.640 --> 35:03.600
often. Um, so yeah, there's a lot, like I just, I think the gameplay is a lot more interesting

35:03.600 --> 35:08.320
than any of the mainline Pokemon games that I've played. I like the fact that there's side quests.

35:08.320 --> 35:12.640
I like how the open world lends itself to that. And the fact that you can really feel like you

35:12.640 --> 35:16.880
can do things in whatever order. And maybe you feel like you're a little behind in levels on

35:16.880 --> 35:21.600
the main quest. Okay, go do these side quests. You know what? I need to go grind some of these things

35:21.600 --> 35:27.600
so I can craft more Pokeballs. I like that. Like, I like that it's a little bit like you don't feel

35:27.600 --> 35:34.720
like you haven't done anything if you spend an hour just catching more Bidoofs and getting

35:34.720 --> 35:39.760
material needed for Pokeballs because you still have, you're going to need those Pokeballs later.

35:39.760 --> 35:43.360
And you know what? You're going to have that full entry on Bidoof and your Poke decks.

35:43.360 --> 35:49.120
So, um, I think that's, I think that's all really neat. I don't think the game is perfect. I'm

35:49.120 --> 35:54.880
going to say, this is my biggest complaint about the game. It feels like a PlayStation 3 RPG.

35:55.680 --> 36:00.880
This like, and I think that's what frustrates people time and time again with Nintendo and

36:00.880 --> 36:05.920
especially Game Freak. Like you think Nintendo's, I mean, at least Breath of the Wild

36:05.920 --> 36:10.720
felt very cutting edge. Game Freak is always really behind in their technological skills

36:10.720 --> 36:14.800
and all this. Um, it just feels like you're playing something on the PlayStation 3. Now,

36:15.440 --> 36:20.960
a good game is a good game, no matter what the graphics are. So does that really matter at the

36:20.960 --> 36:25.920
end of the day? Not really, but it is still frustrating to see that potential. And when

36:25.920 --> 36:31.440
you see those comments on Twitter from people that are like, Sony should buy Nintendo. So

36:31.440 --> 36:36.480
Nintendo has to make PlayStation 5 games. That's where those comments come from.

36:37.360 --> 36:43.920
Is the frustration on the PlayStation 5. I mean, that's, that is very true. Um,

36:43.920 --> 36:49.680
is that you just, you see the potential for more with like, like I just said at the beginning,

36:49.680 --> 36:56.560
it's 20, nobody knows how Arceus, Arceus, Arceus is pronounced. Well, I mean, you all have your

36:56.560 --> 37:01.520
arguments, which is fine, but we don't really know because there's still no voice acting in

37:01.520 --> 37:06.880
these games. And to be quite frankly, a lot of the text and everything feels a little bit like

37:06.880 --> 37:11.520
a slog in the beginning of the game. But once you finally get into it, it is really rewarding. And

37:11.520 --> 37:17.840
to be fair, and I think it's important to say, Pokemon Legends will still run in handheld mode.

37:17.840 --> 37:21.760
And a lot of people are running it in handheld mode and for a handheld game,

37:21.760 --> 37:26.560
it does look really good. So there is that. And if you are going to be playing exclusively in

37:26.560 --> 37:30.800
handheld mode, then probably my PlayStation 3 comment isn't gonna, isn't gonna make a

37:30.800 --> 37:36.400
lick of difference to you. But yeah, it is frustrating to see that potential really

37:36.400 --> 37:41.600
lagging behind. Especially when you have games like Xenoblade Chronicles looking the way it

37:41.600 --> 37:46.880
does on the same hardware. It's like, you could probably do a little better if you put a difference

37:46.880 --> 37:56.400
to do behind it. But Game Freak gonna Game Freak. Chad Stars again chat says, no, we know how it's

37:56.400 --> 38:00.480
pronounced. Sure. We know how Jiff is pronounced, but we all rejected that and said, no, it's GIF.

38:00.480 --> 38:04.640
I mean, you know, it's, people are going to do what they're going to do. Language evolves.

38:05.680 --> 38:12.320
Let's see. Jason in chat says, I've been thinking about buying Arceus thinking it might be the game

38:12.320 --> 38:18.400
that gets me back into the series after I, after I tired, I'm tired of the mainline mechanics.

38:18.400 --> 38:23.120
I would really, you know, not to, not to promote my own stream, but I would encourage you to check

38:23.120 --> 38:27.840
out some YouTubes and streamers that are playing the game just to get a feel if it might be for you.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.840
Because just reading your comment, if you're sick of the mainline mechanics,

38:32.560 --> 38:37.600
this is a different game. Now, yes, you do do battling in this game, and it's actually kind

38:37.600 --> 38:42.080
of hard. Like you can't really steamroll Pokemon just because you have a type advantage. They can

38:42.080 --> 38:46.080
still do a decent amount of damage to you, and you'll feel like you're burning through potions.

38:46.080 --> 38:51.200
But in a way, I feel like that feels a little more rewarding for having crafted those potions

38:51.200 --> 38:56.480
in the first place than just my usual hoarder tendencies in a Pokemon game to just run right

38:56.480 --> 39:00.560
back to a Poke Center and never have to touch a potion, except unless I'm in a gym battle or

39:00.560 --> 39:09.840
something like that. So there is that as well. So. SSG100Matt in chat says, I don't give Nintendo

39:09.840 --> 39:14.160
a hard time because they make these games fun. Nintendo had the biggest selling game last year,

39:14.160 --> 39:19.040
Animal Crossing. That is not a big graphically demanding game and no real voice acting. Yeah,

39:19.040 --> 39:24.960
fair point. And I didn't say, you know, again, I really like this game. It probably. I mean,

39:24.960 --> 39:28.880
ask me after I've spent a few more hours in it. It's probably honestly probably going to be my

39:28.880 --> 39:34.640
favorite Pokemon game. I feel like it's that much better than like even the mainline games and all

39:34.640 --> 39:39.600
that. But let's say give me a few more hours just to really make sure on that point. But I'm not

39:40.560 --> 39:44.720
I'm not saying I don't get frustrated that there's that potential to be even better

39:44.720 --> 39:50.800
that is unrealized. But I guess this is the first in a series and hopefully the first in a series.

39:50.800 --> 39:54.560
I don't after the critical reception this game's getting and I would imagine the sales have been

39:54.560 --> 39:59.120
pretty good to just based on my social media. I don't see how they don't think about having

39:59.120 --> 40:04.320
to do a follow up in one way or another to this series. Loki, you're going to say something?

40:04.880 --> 40:08.560
Oh, no, I was going to say, yeah, even though the Animal Crossing was the best selling game,

40:09.600 --> 40:15.680
and it has a simpler art style, doesn't mean that they didn't execute their art style flawlessly. I

40:15.680 --> 40:21.280
mean, I think that there could have been a lot that they could have done to make that game look

40:21.280 --> 40:25.760
better. It does look pretty rough around the edges. Not to say it's a bad playing game,

40:25.760 --> 40:29.840
but it's like, and they kind of could have done a little bit more with this.

40:30.880 --> 40:34.640
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says I was speaking towards the internet trolls who think that

40:34.640 --> 40:41.360
Nintendo needs 4K gaming with all the P's. Well, it wouldn't hurt. And there is a part of me that

40:41.360 --> 40:47.760
kind of wonders, was this game originally being made for a 4K switch and maybe we're seeing a

40:47.760 --> 40:54.000
scaled down version of the graphical power? I hope not, because I would look terrible in 4K.

40:54.000 --> 41:00.240
But what if we're not seeing the fully realized version? Because, I don't know.

41:00.640 --> 41:05.120
Just a thought. Anyway, because even if you're into those art assets in the

41:05.120 --> 41:09.680
low resolution, that still isn't changed how they have every the models and stuff in the game. It's

41:09.680 --> 41:15.360
just, no, like, really, to me, what stands out is really cheaply done is the environments. The

41:15.360 --> 41:21.600
environments to me look like, you know, it looks like stuff I would come up with in Unity, because

41:21.600 --> 41:26.800
I have no experience in making environments that look organic. It would be the stuff I'd come up

41:26.800 --> 41:37.360
with, unfortunately. And that's not a compliment. I think they could have done better. It just looks

41:37.360 --> 41:44.480
old. It looks dated. Shad Starsick in chat says this is considered mainline and not spinoff,

41:44.480 --> 41:50.080
so it could easily get another entry. Good. However, y'all want to spin it with a different

41:50.080 --> 41:55.280
series of things. I think that this definitely deserves another entry. I would far rather see

41:55.280 --> 41:59.040
another game in this series than in the Let's Go series, which I would imagine at this point is

41:59.040 --> 42:04.400
probably done. And I can also say I've already put more hours into this, Pokemon Legends, than I did

42:04.400 --> 42:09.280
Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl. That one kind of wore off after, like, just a few hours. I think I

42:09.280 --> 42:13.840
got maybe to the second gym and I was already over it. And maybe I'll go back at some point,

42:13.840 --> 42:17.920
maybe when they put in the home integration or something, but as of right now, I don't even care

42:17.920 --> 42:23.840
about that anymore. I just want to play Pokemon Legends when it comes to that. So. Fifth Dream

42:23.840 --> 42:29.040
in chat says, everyone, I love Breath of the Wild. Everyone. PLA, Pokemon Legends Arceus,

42:29.040 --> 42:34.880
looks like Breath of the Wild. Everyone. PLA looks like shit. I get that line of thinking,

42:34.880 --> 42:39.760
but I'm going to be very clear. Breath of the Wild is a far better looking game than this.

42:40.640 --> 42:47.920
But that's not to say this is bad. It's just, it's PlayStation 3 good. It's not really pushing

42:47.920 --> 42:52.720
the envelope graphically or anything like that. So, and Breath of the Wild was a better looking

42:52.720 --> 42:59.360
game. But this has, this has that sort of style to it. And again, I think we're having a lot of

42:59.360 --> 43:04.080
arguments and stuff about the things that are wrong with it. There's a lot that's really right

43:04.080 --> 43:08.960
with it. I really like that there's multiple ways to catch Pokemon. You want to battle them the more

43:08.960 --> 43:12.880
traditional way, wear them down. Great. You want to stealth and bonk them in the back of the head

43:12.880 --> 43:17.200
with a Poke Ball and catch them that way. Great. Like, I like that there's different ways to do

43:17.200 --> 43:20.560
things. You can use items, and that's very reminiscent of Breath of the Wild too, to,

43:20.560 --> 43:25.440
like, distract Pokemon, like start a fire over here, not really in Pokemon, but you throw a

43:25.440 --> 43:29.680
smoke bomb or something, distract the Pokemon and then, you know, do it that way. I like that

43:29.680 --> 43:34.960
there's many different ways to approach a problem. And I think that's kind of cool. So there's a lot

43:34.960 --> 43:42.640
of, there's a lot of great things about the game. And the graphics just aren't one of them. And

43:42.640 --> 43:49.680
that's, that's okay. I just hope that if they do continue to invest in Legends, which they should,

43:49.760 --> 43:55.200
and I don't know if that means some of these concepts show up in Gen 9. That's still a little

43:55.200 --> 43:58.960
weird to me how that would work, because then I feel, I feel like there's got to be Pokemon people

43:58.960 --> 44:03.600
out there that don't want to see a lot of this stuff come to the mainline games, because the

44:03.600 --> 44:09.840
mainline games kind of exist as an RPG only. So I don't know how that ends up working or whatever,

44:09.840 --> 44:15.120
but I feel like there's got to be a place for this Legends formula. I also understand maybe

44:15.120 --> 44:20.400
they don't want to do like a historical thing for every generation, although somebody planted

44:20.400 --> 44:27.280
that idea in my head about a medieval game for the Sword and Shield generation, which I think

44:27.280 --> 44:33.280
would be pretty cool. But just, just the way this game works in, you know, the Pokemon context.

44:33.280 --> 44:34.080
I hope they do something.

44:34.080 --> 44:40.320
Pokemon Assassin's Creed. The different, different timelines.

44:40.320 --> 44:40.880
Yeah.

44:40.880 --> 44:41.760
For reasons.

44:42.480 --> 44:46.800
Uh, let's see. ST-100 Matt says, we'll see how that Breath of the Sonic the Hedgehog goes.

44:46.800 --> 44:51.680
I'm curious about that one. That's for sure. Um, Mike Def says, I think Game Freak and the

44:51.680 --> 44:56.240
Pokemon company have gone on record to say that they're done with Let's Go, but don't quote me

44:56.240 --> 45:03.600
on that. I just see that. I like that game. I didn't hate it, but it's very reductive with the

45:03.600 --> 45:09.120
other remakes they're doing. And I think I completely understand the argument that like,

45:09.120 --> 45:14.800
how many times do we have to redo gen one, like let the series do their gen five remake

45:14.800 --> 45:21.520
or whatever. But I'm, I'm just, I'm far more interested now in what's the next legends type

45:21.520 --> 45:25.440
game going to be like, that's, that's where you're going to get my most interest at this point,

45:25.440 --> 45:31.040
even more so than gen nine, to be quite honest. So there's a cute little crossover event in

45:31.040 --> 45:38.560
Pokemon Go. You can catch the little, um, Hoi San, um, Voltorbs in the, um, let's in, uh,

45:38.560 --> 45:44.400
Pokemon Go right now. So I thought that's really cute. So, all right. That was my gaming week.

45:44.400 --> 45:48.640
I talked a lot about that game, but I know it's been a lot of people's gaming weeks. So, uh,

45:48.640 --> 45:52.480
you know, we had to talk about it a little bit, but I dev again, if you're on the fence about it,

45:53.040 --> 45:57.280
check out some let's plays, check out some YouTubes and stuff because, um, you're going

45:57.280 --> 46:01.840
to see, it's a very different type of Pokemon game. And I think it might fix some of the issues

46:01.840 --> 46:08.880
that felt very repetitive sometimes in the mainline games. So, all right, let's move on.

46:08.880 --> 46:13.440
We're going to get into some news first. I want to remind you, there is no show on February 20th.

46:13.440 --> 46:17.840
That's a few weeks from now, but just a reminder, there's not going to be a live show or a podcast

46:17.840 --> 46:23.280
that week. I'm moving. So, uh, we'll have what we'll have 9 0 2 9 0 3, and then there's going

46:23.280 --> 46:28.320
to be a break. And then when 9 0 4 shows up, it's going to look different because, uh, my whole set

46:28.320 --> 46:32.240
up at the new place is going to be different. So that'll be fun. Hopefully I'll be at a place where

46:32.240 --> 46:35.920
dark soccer and Loki can actually see my webcam now. Cause I don't know if you guys know this,

46:35.920 --> 46:40.640
they can't see me. I can see them, but they can't see me. So like, if I were to do something like

46:40.640 --> 46:46.640
this, that's all right, Rob, they can't see it. So, uh, but in the delay, it's fun. Oh,

46:46.640 --> 46:52.240
you see me on a delay. Okay. Um, but in the new set up, I'm actually hoping I have a way to fix

46:52.240 --> 47:00.080
that. So, uh, stay tuned. Anyway. Um, let's move on, get into some news and, uh, boy. Oh boy,

47:00.080 --> 47:05.360
Loki. This is, this is a fun one to start with tonight. The viewers at home. I just want you

47:05.360 --> 47:09.520
to know that my eyes rolling back in my head, it's not me dying or having a stroke is just,

47:09.520 --> 47:18.240
this is just as stupid as possible. Um, so Tari celebrated their 50 years of making games, except

47:18.240 --> 47:22.800
they haven't been making games for quite a long time, but sure. You know, they've been around

47:22.800 --> 47:32.640
for awhile. So what's the best way to do that? Well, of course, NFTs, but not just NFTs. Oh no,

47:33.280 --> 47:38.720
that we can't possibly just do one thing that people hate, but we're also going to do NFT

47:38.720 --> 47:45.120
loot boxes. That's right. Two things that people hate rolled in the one and they call them GFTs

47:45.120 --> 47:56.320
like digital gifts. Aren't they already digital? Yes. So GFTs are like hallmark cards for the next

47:56.320 --> 48:03.520
generation. That's funny because no one really cares about cards either. They're kind of for

48:03.520 --> 48:11.520
yourself. I don't care about cards. Um, and, uh, apparently, you know, rather than being

48:11.520 --> 48:17.840
some small predictable token, um, GFTs are governed by a loot table with predetermined

48:17.840 --> 48:27.040
random rates. Um, now what exactly is in these? I have no idea. I mean, it looks like it's just some

48:28.240 --> 48:34.880
10 images inspired by the gaming past of the company. Um,

48:34.880 --> 48:44.400
um, yeah, not really worth it. If you ask me, I'm not sure how much these are going for, but

48:46.000 --> 48:51.760
not buying them. Now, Mike Defton chat points out, curiously enough, NFT loot boxes already

48:51.760 --> 48:58.320
exist. Yes. Um, this isn't the first way it's been implemented, but, um, I, you know, it's,

48:58.320 --> 49:04.160
it's two bad ideas. Uh, you know, NFTs, we already have talked about that and now it's

49:04.160 --> 49:07.760
loot boxes on top of that. It's just like to make a bad thing and make it even worse.

49:08.320 --> 49:13.360
Um, but boy, Atari sure seems to be wanting to find the money wherever they can get it.

49:13.360 --> 49:20.000
Huh? Yeah. So basically it contains one of 10 images and two of those images are the epic

49:20.000 --> 49:34.400
rarity. It's just, I don't know. I was just so stupid. I'm sorry. Like, cause I just,

49:36.240 --> 49:40.320
where's the, like, I get it. There's a speculative market for this stuff right now, but like

49:41.200 --> 49:46.560
when that goes away, like no one's going to care about those stuff. It's not probably very good

49:46.560 --> 49:53.840
art anyways. It's just your pain. It's like stamp collecting, I guess. At least that you have,

49:53.840 --> 50:01.920
you know, physical PC can trade. You would think for their 50th anniversary,

50:01.920 --> 50:06.640
Atari would have something a little more, I don't know, like something to celebrate. I mean,

50:06.640 --> 50:11.680
since they keep relying on that seventies collection, like you would think that they

50:11.680 --> 50:15.840
would have like a, a definitive Atari collection or something. I mean, I guess they have the

50:15.840 --> 50:20.480
flashback consoles. They did have that Atari. I don't know. There's like volume one, two,

50:20.480 --> 50:24.800
three that was on like PlayStation four and Xbox one, not that long ago. They have that they're

50:24.800 --> 50:30.400
they're sad little PC, the ant stream deal, which kind of seems to be, you know, another big place

50:30.400 --> 50:33.200
where they exist right now. But I don't know. I would have thought that they'd have something,

50:33.200 --> 50:36.800
I guess, arcade one up machines too. Maybe there'll be a 50th anniversary,

50:36.800 --> 50:40.560
Atari arcade one up or something. I don't know. I just wouldn't have thought that there were other

50:40.640 --> 50:47.840
places to sort of celebrate 50 years, which is a pretty big milestone. Other than fricking NFT and,

50:47.840 --> 50:52.960
and things that, you know, most people are not even going to know what they are. So it's just,

50:52.960 --> 50:59.840
it's silly. Yeah. And this is being brought to us, I guess, by Republic realm who's sold NFTs

50:59.840 --> 51:09.680
in the past. They sold a picture or it's like, I guess, a 3d model of a quote unquote yacht.

51:10.720 --> 51:15.600
It just looks like once again, comparing it to my terrible skills, it looks like something I

51:15.600 --> 51:21.920
would model in a 3d program within a time limit of 15 minutes to in time in a yacht.

51:21.920 --> 51:27.680
It looks more like an aircraft carrier if you ask me, but yeah, they sold it for

51:28.240 --> 51:38.400
149 Ethereum or $650,000. It's just why there are people out in this world

51:39.200 --> 51:46.400
that have so much money and are so stupid. Well, a lot of these like logically thinking it through,

51:46.400 --> 51:51.520
like if you really want to be like, how did somebody spend this much money? My guess is

51:52.160 --> 51:56.720
because it's somebody that's embracing this whole NFT thing and getting in on it early.

51:56.720 --> 52:02.480
They were probably the type that got in on Bitcoin or Ethereum or any of that stuff relatively early.

52:02.480 --> 52:08.640
So probably at a low value, they accumulated quite a bit of that type of coin. And now,

52:08.640 --> 52:14.320
because their perception of what is money is probably very warped by coming into a lot of

52:14.320 --> 52:19.840
money very quickly, it doesn't feel like as much money as it does to you and me.

52:19.840 --> 52:22.960
Like logically, that's where I really think somebody ends up spending this kind of money

52:22.960 --> 52:28.080
on this type of situation. Now they have to convince everybody else. It's because this is

52:28.080 --> 52:34.160
the thing. What is 600 Ethereum to you that is apparently now like, I'm sorry, 50,000 or whatever

52:34.160 --> 52:39.680
it was to the rest of us, you have to be able to, and that's why you see all this real pointed

52:39.680 --> 52:44.480
language and stuff on social media and all this stuff, because they're trying to convince people

52:44.480 --> 52:50.320
that their money is worth what apparently it's supposed to be and none of us believe it.

52:50.320 --> 52:59.360
I just, like, even if this, even if they were trying to sell this for $1.49 and not $650,000,

53:00.480 --> 53:07.040
it's not even worth that. Like, it's just, it's just garbage. Like, I don't, whatever, I guess,

53:07.040 --> 53:13.040
you know, some day down the road, you're going to think about, you know, that guy that bought,

53:13.040 --> 53:17.360
you know, pizza with Bitcoin and spent like, I don't remember how many, what the equivalent

53:17.360 --> 53:21.520
of millions of dollars in today's money that that would have been worth, but it, this is

53:21.520 --> 53:27.920
essentially that you're buying garbage for something that Ethereum could be worth like a

53:27.920 --> 53:32.080
ton of money, like in the future. I mean, it's already worth pretty, you know, quite a bit,

53:32.080 --> 53:40.480
but like even more so I just, whatever, I guess I'm just one of those, those gamers. It just

53:40.480 --> 53:45.520
doesn't get it. DJ Rama S in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says,

53:45.520 --> 53:50.480
a wise man once said a fool and their money are soon parted. There's a lot of,

53:50.480 --> 53:56.240
a lot of modern things to read into with that for sure. I was going to say forgiveness is divine,

53:56.240 --> 54:02.000
but never pay full price for a late pizza. E3 VL in chat says it's, you get it, right?

54:02.000 --> 54:07.680
E3 VL in chat says it's like pogs back in the day. I thought it was worth a lot back in the day. Now

54:07.680 --> 54:12.080
it's worth nothing. Well, you know what? I also kind of put in that bin and I know this is gonna,

54:12.080 --> 54:17.520
this is gonna ruffle some people's feathers. I put things like magic cards and baseball cards

54:17.520 --> 54:22.320
and not that I'm comparing those to NFTs. I'm talking about like what the value is to some

54:22.320 --> 54:27.920
people. When I was in high school, sold magic cards. Oh, is that, oh, that's exactly where I

54:27.920 --> 54:32.240
was going is that, you know, magic's been around since I was in high school, not to date magic or

54:32.240 --> 54:37.360
myself, but that is it. So I sold my first deck of magic, the gathering cards, because I was over it.

54:37.440 --> 54:41.760
First deck of magic, the gathering cards, because I was over it and I sold it to a friend for 35

54:41.760 --> 54:47.280
bucks. I'm probably like that guy who bought the pizza for a million dollars in Bitcoin today.

54:47.280 --> 54:53.840
There probably was shit in that deck that is now worth money to somebody in that deck today. But

54:53.840 --> 55:00.480
to me, I was over it. It wasn't worth anything anymore. And so am I upset about it? No, it was

55:00.480 --> 55:05.440
because I don't, you can't sell those cards to just anybody. You've got to convince somebody

55:05.520 --> 55:09.760
that, you know, rare printing with the black border, sorry, I have a hard time speaking

55:09.760 --> 55:13.200
the language because it's been so long. You have to convince people that it's worth that kind of

55:13.200 --> 55:18.800
money. And to certain people it is. And a lot though, like if you're talking about like

55:18.800 --> 55:26.240
traditional artwork, like these like paintings that go for a lot of money are typically from

55:26.240 --> 55:33.280
like very famous artists that have, you know, reputation or quality of work to them that are

55:33.280 --> 55:39.360
sought after. And that's why those pieces are worth so much. I don't know who this person is

55:39.360 --> 55:44.960
that drew some, some apes on the internet and made like, I don't know how many hundreds of them like

55:46.160 --> 55:50.160
that literally means nothing to me. Like, and I don't understand why they're going for so much,

55:50.160 --> 55:55.360
but then you have like celebrities, like, you know, Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton

55:57.280 --> 56:01.920
going on their shows and saying, Oh look, I identify with this eight because I wear a

56:01.920 --> 56:08.080
striped shirt as well sometimes. And it gets normalized in this sense, but I think a lot of

56:08.080 --> 56:11.360
people are just kind of rolling their eyes. Like, I don't get this. It doesn't make any sense. And

56:11.360 --> 56:15.760
it it's, it's not that we don't understand how commerce works and how like, you know,

56:15.760 --> 56:24.880
Oh, this is going to be worth something, but it's not like, you know, if I have a piece of art,

56:24.880 --> 56:29.760
you know, a Rembrandt or something like that, and I have it hanging in my house,

56:29.760 --> 56:39.200
that is a piece of art that I have. Whereas, you know, if it's an NFT, someone can literally go

56:39.200 --> 56:46.880
get an exact copy of that. And in like, it's pretty much effortless. It's, there's no uniqueness

56:46.880 --> 56:56.320
to it aside from what a blockchain says, you own this. Okay. It means nothing. It really does.

56:56.320 --> 57:01.440
And it's not even like you own the rights to anything. It's just like,

57:02.960 --> 57:09.520
it, it's, it's silly. It's, it's, I think trying to find more utility for blockchain technology,

57:09.520 --> 57:15.920
which I think that there is, you know, possible uses for blockchain, but like NFTs, I just think,

57:17.200 --> 57:20.000
I don't know. I just think that they're really trying to make it work.

57:20.640 --> 57:24.560
But why put so much effort into something like this when we could have

57:25.200 --> 57:27.920
say improved quantum computing for home use?

57:30.560 --> 57:33.840
Whatever happened to using your computing power for folding at home

57:33.840 --> 57:36.960
as opposed to Bitcoin mining, right?

57:39.120 --> 57:44.800
And if they're worried about security, nevermind. I could get completely started on.

57:44.800 --> 57:52.400
All right. To, to be fair, I'm done talking about those no fucking time things.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.760
We always say we're done and then more shit happens.

57:55.760 --> 58:01.280
Because it's the gaming industry because the gaming industry won't shut up about it. You know,

58:01.280 --> 58:05.200
this is the show about video games and gaming culture and whether we like it or not,

58:05.200 --> 58:09.920
this is showing up and it's because these executives are convinced they are missing

58:10.480 --> 58:13.360
the million dollar Bitcoin pizza or whatever the fuck it is.

58:13.360 --> 58:16.640
If they don't get their companies in on this, I just want pizza now.

58:16.640 --> 58:21.600
I know it doesn't really good, doesn't it? All right. Well, let's move on and let's talk about,

58:21.600 --> 58:26.080
Hey, what I think is actually a good idea in the game industry and one that now a lot of

58:26.080 --> 58:30.720
people are trying to compete with in their own way. It's Microsoft game pass, right?

58:30.720 --> 58:36.240
So interesting enough game pass. I never really realized this, but there's probably a lot of

58:36.240 --> 58:41.040
people who buy game pass and then never use it. Kind of like a gym membership. And, you know,

58:41.600 --> 58:45.920
Microsoft has these things on auto renewal because you know, that's how gyms make their money.

58:45.920 --> 58:51.120
Yeah. People who have a gym membership and then never go. Right. Well, interesting because thanks

58:51.120 --> 58:58.720
to a recent settlement in the UK, basically. They're going to be making some changes to the

58:58.720 --> 59:03.040
way Xbox live gold and game pass. Microsoft is going to be making a change to this.

59:03.040 --> 59:09.520
So if you have not used Xbox live gold or game pass in a year, you're going to get in touch.

59:09.680 --> 59:12.880
Basically Microsoft's going to send you an email or something and say, this is how you stop your

59:12.880 --> 59:20.880
payments if you want to opt out. But if you keep doing it over another 12 months, so two years,

59:20.880 --> 59:26.880
Microsoft stops taking payments. Now, well, Microsoft isn't quite doing this out of the

59:26.880 --> 59:31.040
goodness in their hearts. They're having to do it to the UK consumers first because

59:32.000 --> 59:37.200
this is a agreement with the competition and markets authority or the CMA in the UK.

59:37.840 --> 59:43.360
However, now where you can say good guy Microsoft is that there's no reason for them to roll this

59:43.360 --> 59:47.120
outside the UK, but they are going to roll it out to the rest of the world.

59:47.920 --> 59:52.640
Perhaps they fear that similar things would have come down the pipeline, who knows, but that is

59:52.640 --> 59:58.000
something that they are doing. So again, UK first and in an interview with the verge, Microsoft said

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.800
it will be rolled out globally in the near future. Although of course we don't know exactly when that

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:09.360
is. Also we do not know how auto renewing systems on the switch or PlayStation plus or any of that

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:15.440
will have to respond. Microsoft has also agreed to have better upfront information about the

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:20.240
memberships, meaning basically like it's very clear that this is not a renewal when your

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.400
subscription is going to be renewed and how much you're going to pay and how to get a refund. So

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:30.240
they have to kind of give all that information upfront. The CMA's executive director of

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.760
enforcement Michael Grenfell said, quote, gamers need to be given clear and timely information

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.680
to make informed choices when signing up for auto renewing memberships and subscriptions.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.680
We are therefore pleased that Microsoft has given the CMA these formal undertakings to improve the

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:50.880
fairness of their practices and protect consumers and will be offering refunds to certain customers.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.400
Very interesting. So it's interesting that the rest of the world is kind of benefiting from that too.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:01.040
So if you've been too lazy to go and cancel your Microsoft game pass because you're not using it,

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.920
well, in two years, you don't have to do it. It'll be done for you. But I also would say

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.880
if you kind of, if you're paying for game pass and you're not using it, you're kind of missing out.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.720
Like there's, there's gotta be at least one free game on there you want to play. So over to our

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.480
chat at twitch.tv slash vog network. Mike Deff says, I feel guilty of that. Barely using my

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.440
game pass sub. You didn't even play the new Taiko no Tatujin? Soon, I'm sure. Keep in mind,

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.280
you only have to use it once in two years. And then they're, you know, they're going to consider

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.240
that you're using it. S2 under Matt says, it's just avoiding lawsuits from the consumer protection

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:44.000
agencies, which is who MS made a deal with in the UK to avoid a lawsuit. Just makes sense. A

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.600
simple email takes the onus off of them. And Zen Monkey 11 says, I'm glad the UK stepped up. Like

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.240
a year ago, I had game pass. I forgot to unsubscribe before the auto-renewal. Microsoft

01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:00.320
hunted me down for their 15 bucks. I couldn't get PC game pass until I paid them. Oh, that's well,

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.640
that's how the gym memberships and all that work too. So interesting, interesting. All right,

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:16.480
let's move on. Dark Sakura. Well, how about, uh, something else online, but it's, it's, uh, it's

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:23.840
not Xbox or anything about that. It's Netflix. Um, Netflix is going to be expanding their

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:30.640
game library. They're working with a Canadian game agency called rock ride game, rocket ride games

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:38.960
to do that expansion. Um, they will be able to play some mobile games, uh, with the partnership,

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:46.080
um, to the games that are, uh, available, um, already are on, this is on the Netflix app is

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:55.960
Domino's cafe and mittens, K N I T T E N S, um, both added in December from rocket ride. Um,

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:02.000
and there are more games coming out. Netflix is saying no ads, no in-app purchases. They're

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.520
included standard with your Netflix subscription to promote the service. Um,

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:14.240
and, uh, it looks like rocket ride has been making a decent amount of money with, you know,

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:22.240
similar deals like this. And they're really happy about working with Netflix. Um, the, uh, Netflix

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:29.680
games app was released, um, well, at least for the Google app store in the UK on November 2nd,

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:37.280
uh, last year and had two stranger things games. So do you want to try?

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.600
Uh, I haven't yet, but, um, I like that Netflix is trying to sweeten the pot a little bit. I

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.560
like the fact that it's, you know, gaming and, you know, other, uh, like movies and TV shows

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:56.400
and things like that. So, but otherwise I had to take out the stuff for dead by daylight.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.840
Oh, well, yeah. I found myself missing the Hawkins laboratory, Rob.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.720
What's the world come to? Yeah, but I think that crows map is pretty good.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:14.560
So I'm glad you think so. All right. Here, let's move on to another story. Uh, that, uh,

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:19.280
has been weeks and weeks long, but, uh, important. And I think, uh, definitely will be the future of

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:24.560
our industry. Loki. Yeah. You would think that the tune would change being that they're going

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.520
to be purchased by Microsoft here pretty soon, but apparently Activision blizzard has called for

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:39.600
a studio wide vote after they refuse to, uh, recognize the union from, uh, Raven QA staff.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:47.440
Uh, so they're going to have to have everybody vote kind of, um, I think it's probably to delay

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:55.360
this from happening. Um, so now, um, the whole company has to vote on whether they should

01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:03.600
recognize the union. Um, and then of course, uh, the staff at, or the QA testers at Raven

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:10.240
have ended their strike, um, following their announcement of the union that they developed.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:16.720
So, um, that's good, but I mean, I think they're probably going to wait and see if it's actually

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:23.280
being recognized by the company, but I'm just surprised that they're willing to do this after.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.320
I mean, I guess any company is looking to squash unions, but.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:34.640
Yeah, I'm a little surprised they don't see the writing on the wall, but this is completely

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.360
unsurprising of the current powers that be at Activision either to, you know, basically be

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.320
like, well, we're not going to recognize it, but, um, I mean, we'll see what happens after the vote,

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:49.440
but, um, it'll be interesting. Uh, I, I think it's interesting. They're under their strike too,

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:54.160
but I also get that like union is like where they want to end up. And ultimately I think where the

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:59.440
game industry is going to end up. So I, I think, I think this is all a process. There's just going

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.760
to play out over the next few years. And then eventually you're going to see a lot more game

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.400
workers that are unionized and, uh, the more and more of them to get there, the more lucrative

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:12.880
those companies are going to be to work for. Especially when they see how, you know,

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.920
this works out for them. I mean, if it ends up working out for that QA team, then yeah,

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.160
I think you could have more people in the other departments following suit. Yeah, for sure.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:29.200
Uh, well, meanwhile, at another troubled company, uh, Ubisoft, um, some news that I don't think is

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.360
very surprising to folks who followed this game because there weren't a lot of folks following

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:39.120
this game, but hyperscape is going to be shut down on April 28th. That game didn't come out

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.280
that long ago. If I remember right. Uh, that was the one that was like, it was more like,

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.720
like it was trying to capture the battle royale thing where I was kind of like apex legends,

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.080
that sort of thing, but they were trying to do more with like anti-gravity vertical

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:55.600
type of stuff. That was, that was the whole thing on hyperscape. So, um, Ubisoft and announcement

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.600
said, quote, we set out to create a vertical close quarters and fast paced shooter experience.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.880
We are extremely grateful to our community for joining us on our journey. We will be

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:08.400
taking key learnings from this game into future products. So it'd be interesting, um, what that

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.320
could possibly mean. If maybe you see a mode like this show up in another game or something,

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:17.600
I don't know. The game just came out in summer of 2020. So it didn't even last a year. In fact,

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:22.000
less than a year before they announced that they were going to pull the plug, um, start to finish.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.160
So that's, uh, that's pretty scary. The, uh, amount of life it was on that. But again,

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.480
to have a battle royale be successful, you have to have a lot of people that are playing it or

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:36.880
else it can't find the people to do a new match. So I think that's probably a big part of the

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:42.880
problem. Um, anyway, so Ubisoft did admit the hyperscape didn't fully meet the high expectations

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:48.480
of our players. Um, and, uh, I think it's because the game was kind of a mess when it came out. So,

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.840
uh, I don't know. Uh, anyway, uh, apparently, uh, Ubisoft may still be trying to do battle

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.960
royale in other games. And so again, this might be something that you see in other titles that they

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:03.680
do, uh, such as ghost recon frontline. Apparently there's going to be one new game in the genre

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.560
there. And, uh, the division heartland is also supposed to have a battle royale mode as well. So

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.200
maybe they'll have more success in an established franchise than trying to do a franchise of their

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:18.240
own. But, uh, no, it's not necessarily that they're blaming their consumers again, but it

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.320
kind of almost the way they phrase that, like it didn't meet the high expectations of our,

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:28.800
of our gamers or consumers. It's like your expectations were just set too high. You just

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:34.400
don't get it. Well, yeah. And, but I think people would also call them out on that because the game

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.560
had its issues. I know, I know. I know that's not the way that they meant it, but like coming after

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:44.800
the whole NFT thing, it's like, guys are just, you're just not in tune with us. Okay. It was

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:50.320
only supposed to be at this level. Uh, I don't know. Uh, Zen monkey 11 in chat says that's why

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:55.920
I hate all these online only games. They come and go within months. Fuck that. Not Fortnite,

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:02.640
not pub G, not apex. So, I mean, I get it. I totally get what you're saying because you always

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:07.200
inevitably the, all these games are trying to be that and emulate that for other companies.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.920
And sometimes they work. Sometimes they don't. It's to me, it's very similar with world of

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.640
Warcraft. When world of Warcraft hit its all time high, you know, around wrath of the Lich King,

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:25.840
how many MMOs did we see come out that just flopped within months? I mean, shit, it almost

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:31.760
looks like new world is headed a similar way. Is that like new world was huge for like 15 days.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.360
And now it's like, you know, but that's not to say every MMO has flopped. Certainly,

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.280
I found fancy 14, which maybe I'm a little biased, but I think most can see that that

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.800
one's done well. And there's other ones as well that have hung in there. I mean, shit,

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.760
EverQuest is still going after all these years. So, you know, there, there are other good MMOs,

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:54.800
but I just feel like whenever there's a good thing in gaming, everybody wants to emulate

01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:01.280
it somehow. Minecraft, right? How many crafting and those types of retro inspired graphic games

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.440
do we see now? A ton. How many of them are successful? Little different there because

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:11.680
the multiplayer environment and the always online isn't as necessary with that. But certainly we've

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:17.680
seen a lot of that. So Mike Deaf says, at least we got some Twitch emotes for that game. I wonder

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.960
if those will stick around. That's for sure. Quest Buster saying there's a rumor floating

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.200
around that battlefield 2042 might go free to play because it's performing so badly. Oh,

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:33.120
that would be very interesting. Ziba SA points out Final Fantasy 11 still going after all these years

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:38.000
too. Oh, absolutely. And it, you know, it blows my mind. They still don't have like a free to play

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.640
model or that, but they're still making updates to that game, even though the mobile version of

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:49.040
that sure disappeared. And Jason points out quite simply, yes, wherever there is success, everyone

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:55.440
wants to emulate it. Look at all these NFT stories we're talking because somebody heard that a

01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:01.040
procedurally generated monkey sold for thousands of dollars. And now everybody wants a piece of

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.400
that money. It's just wild. They saw how easy it was. They saw how easy it was. And now, well,

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.680
and look at, look at Konami. Konami should have never made the kind of money they did

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.960
on that Castlevania stuff. But here we are. They did. And now Atari is like, oh shit,

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.800
we got a retro collection we can tap into too. And this is, it's just going to be cause that's

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.480
all the investors are going to see are dollar signs and look at all these idiots on the

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.240
internet with all this money, all this money that they don't know how to spend.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:36.000
Anyway. All right, let's move on. Dark Soccer, I believe you're next.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:44.320
Well, Nintendo is of course very protective and very greedy with their IPs,

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:51.360
with any of their properties. And there is a popular video game music channel

01:11:51.680 --> 01:12:03.840
called a Gilva Sonner. And they've actually targeted them before, but now they

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:15.280
have been hit with 1300 takedowns for so many different soundtracks, you know, Smash Brothers

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:23.120
and various Mario games and Legend of Zelda games. And so the, the owner of this site,

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.000
I'll just read the quote. I see a lot of assumptions being made by some of you with

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.360
some extreme words against me. Let me clarify again that I do not monetize videos and do not

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:39.120
profit from them. I do realize that doesn't justify uploading the content. I'm also not angry

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.920
or surprised that Nintendo is doing this, but I do think it's a bit disappointing. There's hardly

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.120
an alternative. If Nintendo thinks this is what needs to be done to set an example, I will let

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:57.840
them take down the channel. It is their content after all. I like the most. Oh, go ahead. Please.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.760
You know, I was going to say, I was going to say, you know what makes me most surprised about this

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:09.920
is like, I see like constantly people using Nintendo music in their live streams, in their

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:20.480
videos, like egregiously. And I would think that like, I would be most wary of using Nintendo

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:28.960
licensed anything in any of my videos because they are so litigious, happy. Just I'm just,

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:37.520
I'm shocked it took this long. I did a series of five to 10 videos on retro games for my personal

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.280
YouTube channel back in like, it was a while ago. I was in the old apartments. It was probably like

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:48.320
2000, but I was with Allen. So it was probably like 2011, 2012. I did these videos and one of

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:52.160
them was about the Legend of Zelda and I'm talking and I'm doing all this stuff, but yeah, the

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:57.280
Nintendo music is there because I'm playing Legend of Zelda. Oh, Nintendo copyright claimed it like

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:02.000
that. I don't particularly care because I'm not really in the business to make money. But I

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.160
thought that was very interesting. That was like, all right, well, I guess, okay. Nintendo is very

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:12.000
much like nobody's profiting off this, but us. But I also understand it is their game, whatever.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:19.200
I like, at least in this story, I feel like the content or it feels weird to say content creator

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.120
because they're not really creating anything, but I would say the YouTube channel owner.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:30.240
I think they have a measured approach. They get it. They're like, I just want a way to listen

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.040
to Nintendo music. And I get it is Nintendo's music. If they want to take it down, okay.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:40.080
But why it, and I get it, it frustrates them as I think it frustrates a lot of us.

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.760
There isn't another way to just listen to Nintendo jams. However, Nintendo wants to make that money.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:50.080
I think there's that frustration because we see Nintendo copyright claiming a lot of this shit

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:57.760
to hold onto it and be like, you know, my precious and not do anything with it, but hold it in their

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:03.600
hand. And that's what frustrates people. And what's also frustrating about it is that Nintendo

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.720
is perfectly within their rights to do that. But that doesn't mean people aren't going to find

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:15.680
other ways to listen to, you know, these epic timeless songs from Metroid, Zelda, Mario,

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:22.400
and so forth as they need to. I mean, every streaming service out there, you name it,

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.520
has at least like orchestral versions, covers, remixes, and things that are a lot harder for

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:33.520
Nintendo to touch. But yeah, the originals, it's really, really, they just, they don't want that

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:37.440
for whatever reason. Quest Buster in chat says, to be honest, I'm surprised it took

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:43.200
this long. Kind of same. Also, I wish Nintendo gave us more options to actually buy their music.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:49.520
Yes. And that's what I'm hearing in the YouTube channel owner's comments. That's what the

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:54.000
frustration is. At least put the music up on streaming services then, or if you think the

01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.080
streaming services don't pay enough, you know what? Put it on a part of the Nintendo online

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:06.960
subscription, a Nintendo music player. Oh my God, what a novel idea. Okay, sure. It's going to take

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.440
a little bit of development time to build that, but you know what? I don't think it would take

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.520
a ton and there's going to be a lot of people that would be super into that. How many of you

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:22.160
would be down for a Nintendo music player as a part of your online Switch membership?

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.680
Technically, they've already kind of got one in Smash Brothers. I mean,

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:31.200
yes, I see Bobby Blackwell pointing that out, but y'all know that's a little different because A,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:39.200
it's not really, it's a very comprehensive, but it's not all encompassing. And B, it is kind of

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.880
buried away in the game, but I get it. I get it. Yes, there is a lot of the music in Smash

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:50.080
Brothers. Why don't they take that out and put it on Nintendo online? I don't know.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:56.800
I would take forethought and they're not going to do that. I don't know. Artificial scarcity.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.440
DJ Rama S in chat says, the problem is that Japanese and American copyright laws are very

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.920
different. Japanese companies don't really care about the American laws and YouTube will comply.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:11.280
Toei hit a YouTuber with over 150 takedowns a few weeks ago. The YouTuber won his appeal,

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.960
but Toei has now stated, you are not allowed to use their anime for any use whatsoever.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:22.880
Interesting. Jason says, game music is very prolific in Japan. RAA and America's

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:28.000
copyright laws are way more stringent. Hell, game OST CDs can actually be bought in Japan.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.720
I feel like we're seeing more and more Japanese companies kind of get on the streaming services

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.280
though. I feel like in our rapid fire news segment, at least once, if not twice a month,

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:43.200
we're talking about some CD collection, some collection just came out. Namco put a bunch

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:48.400
of music up. Capcom put a bunch of music up on. Apple Music, Spotify, blah, blah, blah. You name

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:56.400
it. It's all there. So it's just, it's interesting to me that Nintendo, again, holds onto their

01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:03.440
precious. So yeah, FitDream says, Squeenix has a lot on Spotify. Honestly, I think that's just

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:08.800
everywhere. You insert name of streaming service here. It's there. So it took a while to get there,

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:14.640
but it's there. That's for sure. All right, moving on. Loki, I think you're next.

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.680
All right. So the Steam Deck has some cool stuff coming through.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.760
No. No.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:24.900
What?

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.000
Nevermind.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:27.380
Yes.

01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:28.240
I'm wrong.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:29.040
Yes. No.

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.200
She's really not liking the Steam Deck.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:37.760
No, I'm just completely, because you guys talk so much over my, about what I-

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.640
No, no, no. I completely understand. This is-

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.140
Wait off.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.880
No, this is the whole reason why it's good to have your products named in very distinct manners.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:59.040
Anyways, the Steam Deck, the Valve portable console PC, they're going to be having cloud

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:04.160
saving for the Steam Deck, which I kind of figured that it would because, you know,

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.600
Steam has cloud saves, so why wouldn't this have cloud saves? But I guess that they're

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:13.840
doing something special with it called Cloud Dynamic Sync, which is supposed to

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.800
be a little bit better. It's supposed to automatically upload all modified save game

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:28.080
data to the cloud prior to the device entering sleep mode. So it's cloud saves, but quicker.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:32.800
Sure. And then, of course, the Steam Deck is actually going to start rolling out

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:42.000
on February 25th. So you can start ordering that soon. When will you get them?

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.760
You don't know. At some point. It'll be out eventually.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:55.760
Well, you kind of get to find out about when you're getting one, right? Like,

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.920
didn't they tell people, like, you'll get one, you know, in the quarter three?

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.960
I thought they already had the orders. Why they already did pre-orders for this?

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:08.160
Are they going to start shipping them out? Because it says you should start ordering

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.240
them February 25th. Yeah, they're shipping them out now, is the big thing.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.160
Oh, I guess the order emails to reservation holders.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:24.640
Yes. I guess that's something separate to pre-order.

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is what it is. They're sending out emails to the people

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:33.680
that reserved it. And the email basically says, hi, you reserved this. Now you can pay the remainder

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.560
of the amount or moving on to the next person on the list. That's what it is. But they paid like

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:44.000
five bucks to hold it. It isn't that dissimilar from what I think GameStop has done historically

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.240
with pre-orders. You pay $5 to pre-order the game or whatever, and then they'll call you,

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.600
they'll call you, but there's only so long they're going to call you before they move down to the

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:57.200
next person on the list. And so that's what this is going on with Steam. People already ordered

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.520
this some time ago, and I guess you could still go order one if you want, but it's going to take

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:09.040
some time to get there. But we finally know that they are actually coming out because this has

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:14.480
been delayed already. It was supposed to be a holiday last year thing, I believe. I don't think

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:19.200
it was much earlier than that. And it's had to creep back a little bit because supply chain

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.360
issues, blahdy blahdy blah. So these things are finally, it seems like it is actually happening.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:28.080
It's happening! At the end of February is when this is finally happening. Pretty cool.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:36.800
Yeah. So we'll see how that plays out. E3VL says GameStop is one week, I think. Bobby Blackwolf

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.360
is kind of outlining a lot of the stuff that I just said and saying every week when they know

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.600
how many they are manufacturing, they are sending emails to the next batch of pre-orders to pay the

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:52.240
remainder and get it shipped immediately. That makes sense. So remember when you gave us $5?

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:58.640
Here's your three-day window. Come get your Steam Deck. Yeah, Steam Deck, not to be confused with

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:05.360
what I'm about to talk about. But yeah, I know some friends that got one. I didn't get one

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.800
because I still kind of want to see what they're actually like and what they look like and what

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:14.000
the reception is. And the reality is now I probably wouldn't be able to get one for a while. But I

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
wonder how many people put $5 down that are going to not follow through with it now. I'd be very

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.080
curious about that. We talked about it here. Oh yeah? If it was going to be worthwhile just with

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:33.680
some of the things that I want to play that at the time I couldn't play on my Mac. And a lot of the

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:39.280
games that I would want to play or the reasons that I would want to play them make a Steam Deck

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:44.720
unrealistic. For example, you know how I like to mod Mass Effect to shit and back.

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:51.120
Oh yeah, modding is going to be interesting. It would completely eliminate any modding or

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:01.520
using screen effects. Like if I was going to play Dead by Daylight through Steam and I wanted to use

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:09.600
you know a color mod or something. I was going to say those Steam Decks will probably get hacked

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:18.000
within minutes. No, no, no. They're just PCs. But you can load whatever you want on them.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:27.200
The operating system on them wouldn't work with the tools that exist. It's Linux, not PC.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:33.840
So a lot of modding tools are based in. Regardless, regardless, I would want something

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:40.880
that's a lot more versatile. Instead of paying, you know, 600 bucks for whatever for it, I could

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:46.720
just spend that and fix my own machine. Will you close the door for me, please? Sorry.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:52.560
Pixel pockets and chat says you can put windows on it if you want. And Mike Deaf says

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:58.000
Steam OS is Linux. So modding is pretty much. I would rather keep Linux, Linux anyway,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.520
because it's a better operating system. But no. All right. Well, we've talked about the

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:10.320
Steam Deck. Now let's talk about the Stream Deck or an official attachment, if you will,

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.840
for the Stream Decks so that Elgato can charge you a lot more money for what some people have done

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:22.160
as an at home type of hack. But it is now an official foot pedal that comes that you can buy

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:27.440
for the Stream Deck, which is, again, the little multi-button machine. Like I use one here at OLR

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.680
to move that little sidebar for those that watch live up and down and change some of the scene

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.560
shots, run the classic Game of the Week video, things like that. So if I wanted to use my foot

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:42.160
to do it, I could with the official Elgato foot pedal. That's only going to be $115.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.280
It's quite a bit of money, but OK. It's certainly, you know, there is something to be said about

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.160
having it just work. You know, if it's in the Elgato, you know, it's like a lot of the

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.520
reasons why people like to do the Apple stuff. It just works. You plug it in, bam, it goes.

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.240
Same thing with the Elgato. Please tell that to my Stream Deck

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:08.000
Mini that has decided to stop working properly while my full-size Stream Deck is fine. I'm kind

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.080
of considering an Excel now. Interesting. Yeah. The one here,

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.000
I think I bought this when OLR first went to Twitch at the end of 20...

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:23.680
I got a math, carry the one, 2018. And I bought that and it's still, they even, I just got a

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.000
version update for it because I think they did some Discord integration in the latest version.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.320
I haven't really explored it, but I think that's the thing that they're doing. So it's kind of

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.880
interesting. So if I wanted to, you know, because I'm sure you guys on camera can see me reaching

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:41.440
for this thing. And so maybe it's visually distracting when I go to advance the story or

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.440
maybe wondering like, what am I doing over here? You know, so if I wanted to be more subtle about

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:51.120
it, I could have a foot pedal, would make us maybe make a thing. Now, again, some people have

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.040
made their own because I've heard about some broadcasters that have their own foot pedal that,

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:59.120
you know, essentially just, you know, presses a key on the keyboard or whatever hot key

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.880
kind of does it automatically. But if you want to integrate it in with your Stream Deck,

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:10.080
you sure can for 115 bucks. So there you go. I don't know if anyone's interested in buying one.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:17.200
We'll see. Let's look up a DDR soft pad to a key patter. And that's what I only do.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:22.880
Not only do you get three buttons, but you get like nine. So that's what I want. A DDR pad

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:26.960
that works with a Stream Deck. How on brand would that be for the history of the show?

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:32.240
Like anything. All it is is there. It's just passing through a key, a keystroke. You can

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:38.640
do the same thing. S.J. 100 Matt about the foot pedal says Mr. Smoosh would just mash the button

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:45.600
or sleep on it. True. Very true. Same thing with the DDR Matt. Smoosh would just plop right there

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.600
on the up arrow and then it would be forever scrolling the scroll bar up. The stories are

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.920
moving by themselves. That's how, you know, Smoosh is in here. It'll be interesting to see in the

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:58.400
new house if you can, because as it is now, he never comes to my side of the studio. So I don't

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:02.560
know if he'll even come into the office. Honestly, when I'm doing the show, I'll probably shut the

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.520
door, kind of like Dar Sacher does. So I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. There's a lot to

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:14.400
discover with the new environment. So. All right. Let's you know, we're talking about we're talking

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:18.720
about controlling things on a computer with your foot. I think we need to go back to a simpler time

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:35.120
when it was it was sprites. Anyway, here comes our next segment. And now it's time to travel

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:40.800
back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:48.320
it. It's time for the classic game of the week. A true classic this week, Dar Sacher. What did you pick?

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:59.440
I picked Wolfenstein 3D, which is pretty much the granddaddy of our FPS games. I mean, if you think

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:06.960
about it, it is a first person shooter that was developed by ID Software, published by Apogee and

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:17.360
FormGen. It was released for DOS on May 5th, 1992, 20 years, almost 20 years ago. And it was inspired

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:24.400
by a 1981 Muse software game, Castle Wolfenstein. And this is actually the third in the Wolfenstein

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:31.360
series. So in Wolfenstein 3D, you play the role of an ally, allied spy,

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:40.480
William B.J. Blazkowicz, who is an American of Polish descent during World War II, escaping from

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:47.680
a Nazi German prison, prison castle Wolfenstein and has different missions to take down the Nazis.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:54.320
It is very, it's kind of like a pretty convoluted storyline, to be honest. It is the second

01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:00.400
major independent release by ID Software after the Commander Keen series. Did you ever play Commander

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:17.280
Keen? Rob? Okay. Anyway, it was programmed in part by John Carmack and John Romero. So they

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:24.400
decided to put it together and it was also designed by Tom Hall, built on the engine

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:29.760
that Carmack made. And it was meant to be fast, meant to be violent and unlike any other computer

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:37.200
game on the market at the time. Anyway, the game was released through Apogee with two sets of three

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:45.200
episodes as a shareware. And the first episode was released for free so that people would hopefully

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:50.320
pay for the rest. And then there was an additional episode, Spear of Destiny, that was a standalone

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:57.200
retail item from FormGen. It was a critical and commercial success, considered to be one of the

01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:06.560
greatest video games of all time. And by the end of 1995, it sold over 250,000 copies. It's one of

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:13.440
the ones that really made, you know, put first person shooters on the map. I mean, I honestly

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:23.840
think that while a lot of people might think of Doom, this was really the bigger one. So it has

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:31.280
very rudimentary 3D graphics. It has different levels that are basically flat panes with

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:37.520
different divided areas. And each level is themed after a Nazi bunker and different buildings.

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:46.000
So you have to go through each area to find an elevator. The levels are 10 for each episode

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.600
grouped together by those episodes with a final level with a boss fight. You know, it has its own

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:58.400
difficult enemy. You have to fight guards and soldiers and dogs and other things while you have

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.960
to watch your ammo and your health. You can fight weapons and ammo is placed everywhere. You can

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:08.640
pick them up off of dead enemies. You can also get, you know, you get your knife, a pistol,

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:18.240
submachine gun, a rapid fire chain gun. And the enemies and objects are 2D sprites that will scale.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:24.800
So it's kind of a 2.5D game. But anyway, you start with 100 health and if you get shot, it,

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.520
you know, goes down and then if it falls to zero, you die. And you start over with a knife,

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:34.640
a pistol, and eight bullets. You start with four lives. You can gain more with extra life tokens

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:42.800
as you go through it. So basically, the episodes, the very first two sets had, you know, each their

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:50.640
own series. So the first series was Escape from Castle Wolfenstein, Operation Eisenfoss, and then

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:59.440
Die Sure Die. And then the next trilogy titled The Nocturnal Missions was a dark secret trail

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:07.040
of the madman and confrontation. And basically it's the Nazis want to make an army of undead

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:13.840
robotic mutant people and you fight robot Hitler at the end of the game. The Nocturnal Missions is

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:20.480
a bit of a sequel, a prequel that talks about German plans for chemical warfare.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:28.400
And then the Spear of Destiny, which was the standalone, has a different prequel mission

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:33.120
trying to recapture the Spear of Destiny after it was stolen from Versailles.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:40.640
They did two sequel episodes, Return to Danger and Ultimate Challenge. And those have to do with

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:47.840
nuclear weapons and summoning demons. Like I said, very convoluted. Anyway, it began development in

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:59.040
1990. Basically, a group of employees from Softdisk calling themselves Ideas from the Deep.

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:04.640
They developed Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the first game in the Commander Keen

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:14.320
series. And then they were doing more games and more software and did things for Gamers Edge

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:20.400
video game subscription service out of Shreveport, Louisiana, which I had been to many a convention

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:31.360
in Shreveport. And then they wanted to quit and basically make their own company. Basically,

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:37.040
since they had created their stuff on the work computers during office hours,

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:45.760
they had to negotiate with their boss and agreed to do a series of games for Gamers Edge,

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:53.440
one every two months. Ideas from the Deep became id Software and they started prototyping

01:33:53.440 --> 01:34:05.440
their own games. They really were trying to push a newly budding 3D graphics style

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:15.360
and wanted to push the limits of personal computers as well to make a fast 3D games

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:24.400
that would keep up with what most people had. So they took a different approach to

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.560
display their graphics. They used ray casting in which the surfaces visible to the player

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.600
are calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player.

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:42.000
And then John Carmack had his 3D engine made using 2D sprites and that started things.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:50.400
So moving a big fast forward through everything, they kept working on Commander Keen

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:57.440
and a few other games. The last one they did was Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter,

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:04.960
which saying that aloud is actually kind of funny. They decided to take some inspiration from

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:13.200
Electronic Arts Deluxe Paint 2 and Pac-Man so they even have a hidden Pac-Man level in the game.

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:20.480
And as they put together their various influences, they made the game.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:29.520
And so they made music for it. There were concerns, of course, about the violence

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:38.080
and screaming loudly in German and the death cam and stuff like that, but people liked it.

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:47.920
When they did Spear of Destiny, they used a new graphics engine that was licensed for

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.600
Shadowcaster and it became the basis of the Doom engine.

01:35:52.240 --> 01:36:02.320
So that's how Wolfenstein 3D led into Doom. The big, weird, crazy thing about it,

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:10.960
there was the Super Nintendo release. Imagineer bought the rights for the game and commissioned

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:17.040
it to port it to the SNES and they were still busy making Doom and Spear of Destiny. So they

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:24.800
basically put it way off bat. Finally, they put one out, but they had to change so many things.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:31.200
There is, of course, Nintendo's censorship, so they had to remove all the Nazi imagery,

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:38.000
remove the German voice clips, replace dogs with giant rats, rescale all of the graphics to fit

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.680
the Super Nintendo's. Because they take all the Germans out of it and everything else. What's left?

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:55.760
Right. But it was released in January 10th, 1994 under Wolfenstein 3D, the claw of Eizenfast.

01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:03.280
And it went out in North America first and then Europe later. But also don't forget,

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:08.800
making the blood green and then finally just removing it. So finally, though,

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.880
they used the source code for the SNES port to convert it to run on the Jaguar.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:23.200
And so they were able to take that port, but improve it well above the DOS version.

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:30.560
And, of course, removed the changes for Nintendo. But they had to slow the game code down to work

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:38.720
on the console. Anyways, it had so many different ports. In 1983, Alternate Worlds Technology

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:48.000
licensed it and converted it to a VR game. In 1994, Acorn Archimedes port was released.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.240
There's a Mega Drive port done by Imagineer, but it was canceled because of technical issues.

01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:01.200
1994, classic Mac OS version had three releases. The first encounter, the second encounter,

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:07.680
and the third encounter, happily named. There's an Atari Lynx version that was offered,

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:15.280
but never started. There's a 3DO version. Apple 2GS port that...

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:20.240
Let's see, it looks like they had some licensing problems with that one.

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:24.880
There's an open source iOS port that was done by Carmack himself in 2009.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:31.520
An unofficial port for the Game Boy Color in 2016. An Android port titled Wolfenstein 3D Touch,

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:38.640
later renamed EC Wolf. There's Game Boy Advance, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:46.320
And the iOS port was the only one that had Spirit of Destiny. And then in 2007,

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:50.640
there was a Steam release for PC, Mac OS, and Linux that had all of the FormGen episodes.

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:58.560
Bethesda, which bought id in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of Wolfenstein 3D with a

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:03.680
free-to-play browser version of the game in 2012, although it was removed a year later.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:12.480
Also, don't forget, Doom had, I think it was level 37, if I remember right,

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.240
was a secret castle, sorry, Wolfenstein 3D level. Do you remember that?

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:23.600
I do. I do remember, I don't remember if it was like 1-1 in this game that was remade in Doom,

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.640
but I remember one of the levels was straight out of this game. It was like a hidden thing.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:33.040
You had to do like, id, dls something, I think. Because I remember,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.960
I think there are codes that were in Doom. Some of them worked in Wolfenstein 3D, I think.

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:45.280
Yeah. Well, I remember that Wolfenstein 3D was also extremely moddable, hackable, and like-

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:45.760
Oh, totally.

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:51.120
I remember sticking around with a map editor for this game and having so much fun. And I remember

01:39:51.120 --> 01:40:00.560
the Mortal Kombat mod that was really legendary for this game. Yeah, this really defines several

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:03.680
years of PC gaming growing up for many of us, honestly.

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:08.560
Oh, for sure. Well, and there's a little bit more, too. They had hoped it would make around

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:18.160
$60,000. Their first royalty check was $100,000. The game was selling about 4,000 copies a month

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:28.480
by mail order. It was the top shareware seller of 1992, according to PC Zone. And by the end of

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:37.360
1993, with the Apogee episodes and Spear of Destiny, they sold over 100,000 units each,

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:42.240
and the Apogee game was still selling very strongly into the next year. By mid-1994,

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:48.720
150,000 shareware copies were registered, and it had sold another 150,000 retail copies of Spear

01:40:48.720 --> 01:41:00.640
of Destiny. However, 20% of the sales were from outside the US, even though the marketing for the

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:06.560
non-English areas was really weak, and the game was banned from sale in Germany because of Nazi

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.480
symbols because their federal department for media harmful to young persons made it illegal.

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:17.920
Famitsu removed the game, reviewed it five months after release, and said,

01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:22.640
view from the character's point of view. It's a real shooter. The game is easy to play,

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:29.280
and it runs well. This is the only game of its type. And to get an American-made game,

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:33.200
getting a good review from Famitsu is a pretty big deal, just saying.

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:34.260
Yeah.

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:39.760
But yeah, not all the ports. So the early ports got really high reviews,

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:46.560
but their sales were not super great. The SNES one was considered a really good

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:51.760
conversion for what it was. Had all the music, the levels. It was still as fun,

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:59.520
even though the censorship was there. The Jaguar version was also highly well received,

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:05.280
but they did criticize some of the character movement and made it not as fun to play.

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:12.240
And the game itself, though, has aged so well, especially the 3DO version,

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:21.520
that they compare it to things like Hexen, Beyond Heretic, and Doom. But now it's a little old hat.

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:28.160
But at any rate, this is the game that spawned a legacy. I mean, we have

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:38.720
I mean, the thing is, is that there I don't know if they were able to re-release it in Germany

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:46.640
because of their software ratings board, but I think, oh yeah, in May 2018, a ruling

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:57.520
said that it was allowable in-game content. So the ban was reversed, and Wolfenstein 3D

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:05.200
decision was considered to be outdated, and that games could, as a form of, I guess, of art,

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:16.800
it could be released. And so in November 2019, so we're talking, you know, what,

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:25.680
I can math, 17 years after its initial release, it was finally removed from the ban list in Germany.

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:33.680
And this engine was licensed to other developers, like the Commander Keen engine. So other games

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:39.520
were Blake Stone, Quarter 7, Operation Body Count, Super 3D, Noah's Ark.

01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:48.720
Okay, I always wondered why that game felt so much like Wolfenstein. Okay, I didn't realize

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:55.840
they had Rise of the Triad. That's amazing. It was actually, Apogee intended an expansion pack

01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:00.400
that was called Rise of the Triad Wolfenstein 3D Part 2, but because the engine had been enhanced,

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:08.640
it was just released as Rise of the Triad. We had another prototype of the engine we

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:17.440
used to make Catacomb Adventure series. And then later on, the mods of Wolfenstein actually led

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:24.960
id Software to create other titles that went into, I mean, part of it was Doom, the Quake series,

01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:30.560
and they left them to be modifiable because fans were having so much fun with it.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.600
I remember playing Gachomon Quake for a very long time in Sailor Moon Doom,

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:43.680
you know, but it led to, you know, different imitators like Ken's Labyrinth, Nightmare 3D,

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:47.360
the Terminator Rampage, Terminal Terror, and Fortress of Dr. Radayaki.

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:52.160
And then we had the reboot. We had Return to Castle Wolfenstein.

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:56.480
We had Wolfenstein Youngblood and Wolfenstein Cyberpilot.

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:06.160
Because remember, if you can't kill Hitler in Bionic Commando, you can do it in Wolfenstein.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.800
All right, well, there it is. Lengthy segment, but because there's a lot to say about this game,

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:18.320
Wolfenstein 3D is definitely one of the all-time classics of, you know, certainly PC gaming,

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:22.160
at least I certainly remember. I remember this, you know, playing this in high school,

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:25.440
downloading it from the local BBS, playing the shit out of this game. And then, of course,

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:30.160
when all the mods came out, it was really open season. But, you know, it is interesting the

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:34.240
things you kind of learn about it later on is that, you know, the fact that, you know,

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:42.480
as you were explaining, how it manipulates basically 2D sprites in a 3D space, you know,

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:48.240
it's kind of like Super Nintendo's Mode 7, like, amped up is basically how this game gets away

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:53.280
with what it's getting away with. But you really see it like how the lights look the same, no

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:57.920
matter what angle you're looking at it. What's that? It's not like Mode 7. Mode 7 is scaling

01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:04.160
of 2D graphics. This is 3D. Well, right. And I did say it's not Mode 7, but like a super,

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:08.880
but it's that same concept of taking 2D sprites and manipulating them in kind of like a, I guess,

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:14.320
a 3D way. Although I guess, you know, Mode 7, if it never really changed the sprite,

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:19.360
it was just kind of like how the system was looking at it. But anyway. And then, of course,

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.680
you know, Doom comes out later that is that true 3D sort of game. But, of course, we don't get to

01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:28.880
Doom without this. And, you know, as you pointed out, especially when it came to the mods and,

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:32.800
you know, a lot of the other things that were born of this era that I think a lot of us miss

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:38.560
sometimes. You know, you were talking about the chat room was talking about the no clipping stuff

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:43.680
being a code that was in the sky. I forgot about that, but God, yes. I mean, that that was early

01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:50.720
speed running for me. Using IDD clip or no clip, ID no clip or whatever the hell the code was

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:55.920
to just get from start to finish as fast as you fucking can. Just bearing through the walls,

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:59.840
not giving a shit about any of the mobs that were in the way or anything like that. It was just.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:04.320
But we know the best codes. Yeah. IDDQD and IDBFG.

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:10.400
There you go. There you go. I remember them to this day, just like I remember in Hexen,

01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:17.600
you can use chicken. And that. God mode is typing Satan.

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.320
All right. Those are the days. Yeah, those are the days. Now get off my lawn. All right.

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:30.960
Your classic Wolfenstein 3D, which somehow had never been a pick before. That was the

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.000
somebody early on said that in chat. This hasn't been picked before. And

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:40.080
that's always like here. Here we are. We're in our nine hundreds now. We started this segment

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:45.680
on episode 250. So we're coming up on almost 700 of these segments. And there's always a game where

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:52.560
I'm like, we've never done this before. How? So. Fantastic. Thankfully, though, because Dark Soccer,

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:57.040
I know you're like, I think I think I might be running out of games here, but thankfully,

01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:02.880
every week new games become eligible. As every week, new stuff comes eligible.

01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:09.200
The general rule is that the game has to be at least 10 years old, although Dark Soccer has been

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.520
known to bend that rule as appropriate, but for the most part is stuck to that. So. All right.

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:20.800
There it is. Rules are meant to be broken and we embrace that here at OLR. All right. Let's do some

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:24.880
rapid fire news. I'm sorry. Actually, quickly, I want to get some more comments in chat here.

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:31.360
VXJ6V says, I never played a Wolfenstein 3D mod. Started with Doom for sure. The most legendary

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:35.680
one I can think of. And I even saw YouTube of it earlier today, because when I was grabbing the B

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:40.800
roll for Dark Soccer's classic game, I was like, I wonder if anybody ever recorded the Mortal Combat

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.360
thing. And they did. And you can see it, although what you can't see, or at least I didn't find that

01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:50.160
YouTube, is somebody actually fighting a boss. Because the only time you ever got to fight like

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:55.920
Scorpion or whatever was the, those were the boss sprites at the end of the game. So those, those

01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:01.920
would be fun to find. So yeah, that was, that was the mod, I think, in my opinion. But also the map

01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:06.880
making mod. You know, it was just, it was just a simple program that would bring up a 2D version

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:12.000
of the map and you would edit it to your heart's content. And good times. Questbuster says, it's

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:18.560
also amazing to see that people are still making mods for Wolfenstein 3D, even today. I wonder if

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:23.200
anybody, I'm surely somebody along the lines like remastered it for 4K and all this stuff.

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:28.240
I'd be very curious to see what that looks like. So, all right. Don't they have those versions on

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:34.640
like Steam though? Probably. Well, certainly Duke Nukem. Duke Nukem had it, so I don't see why not.

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:39.280
So, all right. Pretty sure that's already been out. I know, I just never thought to go look for it,

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:45.760
Loki, to be honest. All right, let's do some other segments here. Let's get into some rapid fire news

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.800
and quickly discuss some other news in the gaming industry. Loki. Hey, remember that Mortal Kombat

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:56.400
movie that came out last year? Well, they're making another one. Okay. Must've done well.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:04.320
I never saw it. It did okay, I guess. It was all right. It wasn't too bad. Certainly not as campy

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:12.080
as the first series of Mortal Kombat movies, but it was all right. So, there'll be a new one coming

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:17.920
at some point, but that's pretty nice. And then speaking of new things coming,

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.680
we're not really ready for this considering the GPU shortages that we're running into right now,

01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:30.240
but Crysis 4 has been announced. And this is coming out or the coming off shortly

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:36.960
that it leaked on Chinese social media, but now they officially announced that yes,

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:43.040
Crysis 4 project is confirmed and they are working on the game. When is it coming out?

01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:51.760
No idea. Just an announcement. Just hurry up and wait. But your PCs are crying already.

01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:58.480
All right. Dark soccer. So, Yacht Club Games is going to be doing a quote,

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:08.000
groundbreaking announcement on Tuesday, February 1st. It's a mega announcement. We don't know what

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.360
the mega announcement is, but they're making one. Good for them. They said a mega announcement,

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:22.000
so we'll see. And then Final Fantasy XIV. It's back on sale, except you can't get free trial

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:31.040
signups for right now, but you can do Steam, PlayStation, a Squinic store. You can pay for it,

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:37.280
but you can't test it out for free. No test drives. And there's a new patch, patch 6.08.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:45.840
Which fixed the sound issues. I'm so happy. So happy. And the Oceanic data center opened as well.

01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:51.680
And the cues, honestly, considering the server I play on, I think is one of the more popular ones,

01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:56.320
not the most, but one of the more popular ones. My cues are usually not worse than 100.

01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:02.720
So the cue problems, it's not a big deal to wait like three minutes and usually I'm up and getting

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:09.280
a glass of water or something anyway. So yeah, it's a lot of the issues that were there at the

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:14.240
expansion's launch are starting to subside a little bit, which is nice. We'll see what happens

01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:20.640
when 6.1 rolls out and there's new content that has everybody coming back, but we'll see.

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:29.440
Hmm. We'll see is a very apt thing for most of the stuff that's going on right now, you know?

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.120
Yep. I'm really excited. That's all I can say. I'm really excited about the data center travel

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:38.240
stuff that's supposed to come out with the next patch too. So I finally get to play with people

01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:41.200
I've never been able to play the game with because we're on different data centers. So that'll be

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:47.040
very exciting. I hope it works. I hope it works out. Okay. Let's take a moment to travel around

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:51.440
the world and check out some release dates. So if you don't feel like buying Final Fantasy 14,

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:54.080
since you can't do a free trial, maybe there's a different game you want to buy.

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:57.520
So let's see what's coming out around the world this week. And we'll start with the U S Loki.

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:03.280
We have the life is strange remastered collection coming out on PC, Nintendo switch,

01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:11.040
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series and stadia and dying light to stay human

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:16.480
on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:23.600
And then finally, Maglam Lord on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four. That's it.

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:29.440
All right. Going to Japan, pretty slow week on the Nintendo switch. There's an English version

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:33.360
of the game farm together that is getting a Japanese release published by rainy frog,

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:37.440
but that is really the only thing on the switch this week. I'm going to guess that Pokemon legends

01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:43.200
having just come out, probably kind of dominated the switch cycle there. But if you go to your

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:48.080
PlayStation five, you can check out dying light to stay human, uh, which is coming out on February

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:53.120
fourth. Uh, and that that's it for PlayStation five. I just want to check the four real quick

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:57.040
and see if they get any, they also get dying light, of course, dying light to excuse me and

01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:02.400
the farm together game, but otherwise that's about it. I'm thinking, uh, Pokemon legends,

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:07.120
they figured would keep everybody busy for a week. So, uh, nothing, nothing else that exciting,

01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:09.440
at least this week, dark soccer. How about the UK?

01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:16.480
Uh, just, uh, only really three things coming out on the fourth, um, for PlayStation,

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:22.000
X-Box dying light to stay human deluxe edition and regular additional is like,

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.960
um, switch autobahn police simulator too. And then for PlayStation switch Maglam Lord.

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:36.800
Looks interesting. That's it. All right. Just a few more stories for you. And then we will open

01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:43.040
our discord for calls. Uh, check out our discord server over at vog network.com slash discord.

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:46.160
Uh, we have a variety of chat channels where we can stay in touch throughout the week,

01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:50.080
including a channel where some of you submit your stories for potential inclusion on OLR.

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:55.120
And I do, I do use that sometimes. Uh, we also, we have a brand new channel on the discord server

01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:00.160
this week, uh, for, for all the dead celebrity posts, because things are getting a little

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:05.920
depressing because every day it was like somebody was dying and what just today we,

01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:10.800
we had our first post in the new channel. Howard has been passed away, which is, you know,

01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:16.640
if you ever watched reruns of WKRP in Cincinnati, you know, how Howard has been Johnny fever. Yep.

01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:21.920
Um, and, uh, also he had another big, you know, he was the teacher and head of the class was the

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:26.720
other big role he had. Uh, and then of course I remember him from clue. He had an uncredited

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:30.480
cameo in clue or, well, he might've been in the credits, but like he wasn't advertised in the

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:35.360
movie. He was the chief of police at the end. Yeah. Our lives are in danger. You beat Nick.

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:40.080
He was the, he was the guy trying to, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, which I can,

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:48.640
I can recite the entire movie clue by memory. So don't try me. Uh, but yeah. No thanks. I just

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:55.280
need to, uh, powder my nose. All right. I played Mrs. Peacock in the last shadow cast,

01:55:55.360 --> 01:56:01.360
which is why I said the line. That was, it's, it's one of the few times I've done drag,

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:08.320
but I'm going to say I was, I was a damn good drag queen. I was all of my makeup was done by

01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:14.080
one of the local Kings. Uh, shout out to serve Vicks who, uh, made a, uh, which I love that name

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:18.080
by the way for a dragging, but, uh, shout out for making me as nice as I looked, but yeah,

01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:27.600
that was a fun show. All right. Uh, let's do no longer Vic knives. Um, so as a performer,

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:35.760
they are cervix and as a craft maker and that they are Vic knives. So gotcha. Okay. Okay. Um,

01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:41.520
going into some other news, Loki was starting off with a headline that I saw this and I thought it

01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:48.960
was cute. Yeah. As, as if you couldn't love the developers of, uh, Joe danger and no man's sky

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:55.920
even more. Um, now five years ago, it was easy to hate them, but now, now you can't help but

01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:04.720
love them now. Um, so Sean Murray had shared this letter DM that he got, uh, from a, a child's

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:08.800
father, um, basically saying I'm writing this letter on behalf of my son, Jack. Jack is eight

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:13.120
years old is about the sweetest kid on the planet and has been diagnosed with autism.

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:18.480
As you probably know, children with autism deal with a great many struggles chief among them are

01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.360
great difficulty with social interactions. However, one of the things that has enabled

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:29.920
Jack and I to bond is our share and love of video games, specifically Joe danger, Jack loves Joe.

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:39.440
And so, uh, paraphrasing the issue is that they used to play it on iOS and the versions of Joe

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:48.320
danger that are out were out previously, um, were basically taken off of the app store because they

01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:55.680
weren't compatible with the newer versions of iOS. So Sean Murray then, um, took it upon his

01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:02.240
team to update Joe danger so that they could play it again on iOS. So that's what they did.

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:09.120
They put out a new version of Joe danger and, uh, well, so the, the two mobile versions of the game.

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:17.520
So, um, let's see, Joe danger touch and Joe danger infinity. And so those are now been updated

01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:24.640
and I guess they did a remaster on as well. So all because of the letter that he received,

01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:30.480
it's pretty awesome. Yeah. Never underestimate the power of speaking up. So, um, I think that's,

01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:34.960
that's cool that they, yeah, I know, I know a lot of like flappy bird no longer works on iOS.

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:39.120
If somehow you still have that game. Cause they did, they did that. Um, I think it was like 32

01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:44.400
bit apps have to be 64 bit apps. I may be wrong on that, but it was some sort of change. They made a

01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:48.800
few years ago, honestly, and just apps that hadn't been touched in a while. And Joe danger was one of

01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:53.040
them kind of fell into that void where they don't work anymore. Um, but I think it's really cool.

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:56.720
They went back and they used it as an opportunity to clean it up a little bit. Like, I think it runs

01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:00.880
as a smoother frame right now. And it looks a little better. Um, if you never played Joe

01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:06.160
dangerous, it's excite bike ish trials, one of those sorts of games. Uh, it's cute. It's,

01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:11.200
it's nothing like no man's sky. So it's wild that it's like the same team. I still don't like this

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:16.960
person first language that they used to speak about people like me. A lot of us prefer just

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:24.720
to be called autistic people. I don't know. It's the kid's father. So that was the one that was

01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:31.760
writing the letter. Um, but I should, uh, definitely check out the Joe danger updates

01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:36.400
on the phone. Cause it sounds like it's, um, super cute. So, and again, never underestimate

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.920
the power of a voice and speaking up and, uh, you might, you might get, uh, developers take

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:46.560
a second look at what you're doing. Yeah. All right. Um, moving on, I think we're too dark.

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:55.200
So Sega is hanging up their arcade towel. It's not, they're, they're not doing the

01:59:55.200 --> 02:00:04.560
arcade thing anymore. Um, they have finally, um, uh, so, uh, we'll announce their intention

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:12.400
to sell their remaining 14.9% share, uh, with its arcade division to Genda Inc., which is the

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:17.840
same company they have, uh, that has purchased the majority of, uh, Sega's other arcades back in 2020.

02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:25.120
So this will mean Sega Sammy is out of the arcade business altogether. Um, and its remaining

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:34.000
locations aren't even using any type of Sega branding at all. Um, the remaining centers are

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:41.920
being rebranded as Gigo Entertainment. Um, a statement from their chairman, uh, it, uh,

02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:47.680
basically says they're going to rebrand Sega's, uh, major Tokyo locations, um, Ikebukuro,

02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:56.320
Akihabara, and Shinjuku, um, before they roll out nationwide branding. Um, for manufacturer,

02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:03.040
uh, Sega is expected to continue to produce units of its current games for worldwide distribution,

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:09.920
but for arcade, running an arcade, owning arcades, it's, it's gone. I mean, and we know that they

02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:14.400
closed, uh, closed down all the game works over here. So. Yeah. I thought it was interesting that

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:20.160
this is, it was like this almost the same week, not quite, but like just within the same breath,

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:24.880
you have game works and now, you know, Sega's arcade, um, physical locations, you know,

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:33.280
in Japan, that is interesting to me that that one, two punched. Yeah. I'm not surprised. Um,

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:44.000
I mean, I think that even with, I think that the harder hit on it came with the pandemic.

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:50.720
I think that had a thing to do with it, but arcades were kind of, I don't, I don't know.

02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:55.520
I didn't see, I mean, I don't know what the arcade situation is like in Japan, but

02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:02.400
anytime I find an arcade, like an actual arcade, it's a unicorn and I want to move in and,

02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:07.360
and put it in a protective bubble and never let it go. Well, I, I feel, yes, yes, I do agree,

02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:12.160
but I, I, this is somebody who worked at a bunch of arcades. No, I know. And I feel like those sort

02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:16.960
of like strip mall or mall mall, eighties mall arcades. Yes. Are like that. But what I do,

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:23.120
what I see instead is now this Dave and Buster round one thing. And that's, you know, now that

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:27.760
if we want to talk about Sega making machines, I feel like round one is going to be the place where

02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:31.120
you're going to see those. At least you're in this. I mean, Sega was never really, you know,

02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:37.200
it wasn't the same thing as it was in Japan here. Um, but, uh, you know, like there, uh,

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:42.080
Sega's makes a ton of those claw machine games. Don't they? I almost positive. I see a ton of

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:47.840
those and round one is full of those. So, you know, and, and whatever else Sega dreams up in

02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:52.320
that space, uh, in the, in the near future for actual physical arcade machines, as you kind of

02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:59.440
pointed out. Uh, but yeah, it's, it's weird that like the multi-purpose entertainment space is

02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:06.080
what's still here, but not the dedicated arcade. Like it's, it's dark soccer, you know what it is?

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:10.480
It's got to have a bar. That's that's how the arcade stays open. It's got to have a bar.

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:17.840
That's seems to be people want to drink and play games. I guess, but that's, that's how Dave and

02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:24.960
bust. I mean, I back even, even hell when this show first started 20 years ago, you, me, Loki,

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:29.680
all the people that ran in our circle, we, it was a huge deal to go to Dave and busters over at the

02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:34.320
great mall in San Jose. Cause you know, the Roosevelt one didn't exist yet. And it's kind

02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:38.720
of sad anyway, but, uh, it used to be a big deal to go on that road trip and go over there and go

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:43.280
to Dave and busters. Cause we're going to play a Derby owners club and, and all this stuff today.

02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:49.040
It was like a big deal. And now I, you know, there's closer Dave and busters and soon we

02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:55.040
might finally have a fucking round one here at some point, some point supposedly this year. I

02:03:55.040 --> 02:04:02.080
mean the theater finally opened over there, so we're just waiting, but well, they're probably,

02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:08.400
honestly, they're probably waiting for this Omicron thing to, you know, start to subside

02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.800
where people feel a little more comfortable about going out. And I know, I know that we're going to

02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:17.520
have to deal with COVID for a very long time, but it's the whole, what is people come people's

02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:21.600
comfort level of going out. Uh, and round one is probably going to open until people feel

02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:26.800
comfortable. And I'm sure you're familiar with what happened to, what was it? The, uh, the drive-in

02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:31.920
arcade. Remember that I came up on the tail end of the last show. I think they burned down.

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:39.040
Yeah, we talked about it. I got to say though, um, clever work around by them,

02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:45.920
uh, not for the arcades sadly, but I heard that they, the theaters opened again and they have

02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:50.800
food trucks. They get six or seven food trucks over there to take the place of the snack bar.

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:55.600
And I thought that was clever and I'm kind of surprised more drive-ins don't just do that

02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:01.600
naturally. Yeah. So that's a good alternative. He has a good alternative. Somebody thought

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:07.840
outside the box of that. Good job. Okay. Um, anyway, so, um, yeah. And, uh, uh, DJ

02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:11.680
Roma S in our chat is talking about, Hey, Sega wasn't really in the arcade business. They paid

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:16.960
to have their name up on the arcades. G-Joe is the G-Go, Geigo is the company that basically

02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:22.960
ran all the arcades and whatnot. Yeah. But it's still, I mean, it's still something to see a name

02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:28.080
like Sega front and center now coming down off the window. You know what I mean? It's a, it's

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:33.920
certain changing of the guard that still makes us a little bit sad. Just like when they stopped

02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:40.480
making hardware. So, Oh, Oh no, I know. I know the other one that makes me sad when their logo came

02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:45.600
down at that building right off I 80 in San Francisco, right where I 80 starts in San Francisco.

02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:51.840
When that was Zinga, it's still, I think it's still a Zinga. Yeah. So yeah, it used to be the

02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:57.280
Sega building. That was, that's the closest thing I can think of Rama. It was sad to see their logo

02:05:57.280 --> 02:06:03.440
come down and a different one go up. So a pistol pocket says, I like what Geigo is an acronym for

02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:10.160
get into gaming Oasis. See, I always, I always thought Geigo was garbage in garbage out. And

02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:15.760
that's something you learn in programming very early on, but yes, get into gaming Oasis.

02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:20.400
All right. Let's move on a few more stories. I think we're back to Loki.

02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:30.160
All right. So this is another example of memes becoming games and joy. We have one now with

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:37.520
steamed hams being its own point and click adventure experience. For those who,

02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:42.720
I can't imagine anybody that's not familiar with the steamed hams thing from the Simpsons.

02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:48.720
Now you can play it Allah, you know, data tentacle monkey Island or something like that.

02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:52.880
I don't know it. What's the, I don't know the meme. You don't know the meme. Okay.

02:06:52.880 --> 02:07:03.520
So it's a principal Skinner is making dinner for superintendent Chalmers and he is cooking a roast

02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:10.560
and then it burns in his oven. So then he's constantly trying to trick Chalmers into thinking

02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:15.920
that nothing is going wrong. So first he comes in and he's like, Oh, what's all that smoke?

02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:19.600
He's like, that's not smoke that steam steam from the steam clams.

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:25.280
And then, so he decides to go across the street to Krusty burger and get hamburgers.

02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:29.680
They brings it back in and pretends that the hamburgers are his own creation.

02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:33.920
And he feeds it to them and basically said, well, wait a second. I thought you said we're having

02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:41.280
steam cleansing. No, not steam claims, deemed hams. It's a New York dial area. It's a New York

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:46.000
dialect. We, I feel like that's been a plot in every sitcom at some point, but okay. I,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.080
that's cute. It's funny. Yeah. Yeah. It gets, it gets even more ridiculous because their

02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:53.120
house is burning down and he's like, what is that? You know, in there, he's like,

02:07:53.680 --> 02:08:00.560
uh, that's the Aurora Borealis. And they're like this time of year in this part of the planet

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:07.760
localized in your kitchen. That's fun. Yes. Can I see it? No, it's, it's stupid.

02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:12.560
So I'm assuming this game has about as much depth as the point and click adventure game.

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:17.600
Don't shit your pants, right? Is that it? Yeah, it's, it's very, it's very short. Obviously

02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:23.360
it's just that bit. They added a few more dialogue pieces there from other episodes of the Simpsons

02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:28.080
to get in there, but apparently the, um, the writer of that episode, the Simpsons, Greg

02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:35.440
Daniels, um, thought is hilarious on Twitter. So, um, go, yeah, go check it out. All right.

02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:39.440
Thank you. Thank you for explaining the meme to my old ass. I appreciate it.

02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:45.520
All right. And last but not least tonight, something that, uh, Jason was teasing at the

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:53.280
top of the show, uh, the Oculus quest no longer called the Oculus quest. It's now the meta quest

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:57.920
because of course we know that Facebook has rebranded things. Uh, so if you own an Oculus

02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:04.720
quest, guess what? Not anymore. It's now the meta quest. I don't know what else to say besides that.

02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:08.800
And how we feel about that name change, but there it is.

02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:18.240
I still refuse to call it meta. Sorry. I will, I will only call meta world peace meta. I'm not

02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:25.200
going to call this company meta. It's just, I feel, yeah, but I guess, I guess now we have

02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:31.280
to actually call it the meta quest or talking about certain VR headsets. Here's that, uh,

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:34.880
see a Tiberian chat says, ironically, meta isn't self-aware enough to understand it.

02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:39.680
True. It's just called the device, the muscle that give you the meta muscle.

02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:45.040
Oh, that's funny. All right. Let's get to the listener round table. Every week we invite your

02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:49.760
emails, your calls on discord over at vog network.com slash discord and any other comments

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:54.800
or things you'd like us to discuss in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network. We do

02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:59.520
invite your emails every week. Participate at orange lounge radio.com, but I believe dark

02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:03.920
soccer has reported that she found dust and not much else in the mailbag. Correct.

02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:11.680
Anybody? No dust. Anybody? No dust. Anybody? No dust. Uh, yeah. Participate

02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:15.840
at orange on trader.com is the place to send your emails. I can't even talk about drag race because

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:20.400
I have, I admittedly haven't been watching the season really outside of just a, just the little

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:27.600
clips I see on social media. What are we left to do? Uh, anyway, um, jacket talk.

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:34.320
Okay. I haven't seen that show. Okay. Okay. I will. Okay. And I don't see calls in the discord

02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:38.640
either. You want me to talk about it? No, I was just saying what TV shows should I be watching

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:45.360
then? Cause I, I see all this about yellow jackets. That one I see for euphoria. So there's

02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:49.920
this clip going around the internet of the girl that's like in the dress and someone thinks she's

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:54.320
in the play Oklahoma and she just fucking loses it on people. And I was like, is that what high

02:10:54.320 --> 02:11:00.400
school is now? I guess. Um, it's, it's wild, but like there's all these shows and I'm so uncool

02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:07.120
cause I don't watch any of them. My wife made me watch yellow jackets. It was all right. Yeah.

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:12.240
That's the one Christina Ricci's in, right? Yes. She does not look like herself.

02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:17.600
She's a little bit older now. She's not as old as she was when she played Wednesday. She's,

02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:23.120
she's blonde in the show. So it's like, she looks like somebody else, but like, um,

02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:28.000
she reminds me of not Amy Poehler. She reminds me of like, there's another SNL

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:33.280
actress that was on there that she kind of resembles, but I don't remember Kate McKinnon.

02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:38.880
Maybe. I don't know. But like, yeah, she's, she's good on the show. I mean,

02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:44.720
there it's, it's an interesting series. It's kind of like, um, you know, it's, uh, it's like,

02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:49.600
almost like a survival drama, like a teen drama and then like a little bit supernatural stuff.

02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:54.320
So it's a little bit lost-ish I guess. Although I say that with,

02:11:54.320 --> 02:12:00.880
out having any context of what loss was like. Um, it's all right. I like it.

02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:07.440
Um, question in chat, uh, from E3VL who asks, anyone see the Halo HBO trailer released today?

02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:10.640
I believe it's actually Paramount Plus. Paramount Plus and it looks awesome.

02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:15.840
Yeah. I don't care. I, I did see the trailer actually. Uh, I wasn't watching the football game,

02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:19.280
but of course it was everywhere on the internet right after that. Um, it looks interesting,

02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:23.680
but I feel like it's another TV show I will intend to watch and then never get around to it.

02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:28.320
Um, but it looked, it looked interesting. I saw that they had Halo in, uh, Boba Fett.

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:37.440
Really? Uh, a whole area looked like a combination of Halo and the Citadel from Mass Effect.

02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:45.360
Oh, inspired. I get it. Okay. Uh, Tiger Claw says the Halo TV series looks like it should be good.

02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:49.440
Don't expect it to follow the same continuity of the games. They said it's an alternate timeline

02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:53.600
that's adjacent to the games. Yeah. I got that vibe from the trailer. Yeah, I wouldn't. Yeah.

02:12:54.480 --> 02:13:02.400
Just go in expecting a TV show and cause that's what you're going to get. Um, yeah, I, I, I guess

02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:07.040
I should try to watch stuff on TV, but I, I tend to watch a lot of like Twitch streaming and then

02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:12.720
I'm playing video games and, you know, forcing myself to watch the book of Boba Fett. It's so

02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:18.800
good. I heard Boba Fett's not even in it half the time. No, no, no, no, no, no. He is in this one.

02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:23.520
There's just the last episode he wasn't in it, but like, okay. The Mandalorian's all right,

02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:27.840
but the book of Boba Fett's been kind of, I don't know. It's been awesome. I don't know what you're

02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:33.280
talking about. It's been great. Okay. You got to watch the earlier seasons and the Mandalorian

02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:37.680
compare like the action, the story elements. I have seen them both. It's a different kind of

02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:45.040
story. And I think they're both equally good. I don't know. It's my opinion is right for me.

02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:50.000
It's it's, it's odd that the, the best episode of the season is the one that he's not in. I don't

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.720
know. Well, I will admit that last episode was the best of the season, but I vastly enjoyed the

02:13:54.720 --> 02:14:01.120
rest of it because I like the culture being built up the expansion of the world. And I think that

02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:05.840
is absolutely fascinating. Plus, I mean, Ming Nao Wen is in it, so.

02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:11.680
No. And I, I agree. I like, I like the expansion, the universe and the showing like different,

02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:17.360
you know, side solid stuff. I like all that. It's just like, they have a lot of really weak,

02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:22.880
they have some really weak characters. The Wookie is awesome. He's going to be my daddy.

02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:28.640
I have to admit, I let, I cut my Disney plus loose. I let it go. I canceled it.

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:33.440
The, the, the, I know this when I do watch TV, if I watch anything, honestly,

02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.360
this is so weird. I can't believe I'm going to say this. I, I really use Paramount plus more

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:41.200
than anything else, which is wild. I never thought I'd say that, but it is what it is.

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:47.200
So, but you know, I like a lot of reality trash TV shows and they're all on there and I've got,

02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:51.760
I will, I will give credit where credit's due to Paramount plus they're starting to bring in the

02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:55.760
international versions. Like I have been watching in the background, not a lot, but a little bit of

02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:00.720
Australian survivor, which I'm starting to realize is superior to the one we have here.

02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:05.840
It truly is like the way it's cinematically shot and told is incredible. So it's,

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:10.560
it's neat that they have that. Cause like, yeah, I love that they, they have different versions

02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:17.680
of stuff. So yeah. And I need, I need to watch, I'm so far behind on Trek, which by the way,

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:22.080
I guess that Star Trek cruise that I went on a couple of years ago, right before the pandemic,

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:28.400
I guess they are going again this year because, uh, our friend, um, captain Matt from the former

02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:34.000
store starboard power coupling show is going and was like, do you want to go there? He's like,

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:38.400
do you want to go? There's rooms available. And I'm like, not with the house. And I I'm,

02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:44.800
I'm not quite at that. I know I've done some risky things, not quite at that comfort level yet,

02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:49.760
but I hope everything works out, you know, it's not, it's still a month away. So there's still

02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:55.840
a month, but, um, yeah, I just thought it was screening people at the gate. They,

02:15:55.840 --> 02:16:03.040
I believe they are, um, like rapid tests on site. I actually believe vaccination and rapid testing

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:11.440
is a thing. Um, good. I I'm pretty sure. Um, but I, I saw a bunch of like, there was some

02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.840
gay cruise that happened and people were packed in there. Let me tell you. And I guess they had

02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:21.680
similar protocol and wasn't, didn't, didn't spread it. So precautions work. How about that?

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:27.280
So, uh, Bobby Blackwell says the rapid test for norovirus.

02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:32.320
Bobby Blackwell says if they're in Florida, they can't lol against the law. I think they found a

02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:38.480
way around it. I think you be, Oh, also it's a private company putting it on the private

02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:44.720
company rented the boat. There's something they did to get around it. Um, and I, I know they had,

02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:49.840
they have to log onto a website and put some of their paperwork on there beforehand or the

02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:54.240
private company won't let them go. So I think that's how they're getting around it somehow.

02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:58.000
And yeah, maybe, yeah, maybe they're testing on the boat or something. I don't know.

02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:02.640
Anyway, but I don't know, cause I'm not going. Um, but I thought it was interesting that that

02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:06.560
is coming up because somebody brought up Star Trek. I'd love to go next year if, you know,

02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:13.440
assuming that, you know, COVID is more endemic and manageable and, um, that, uh, you know,

02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:17.360
the, the money situation is good and all that stuff. I'd love to consider going again. I had

02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:23.520
the best time, um, before, you know, literally the week before the, everything went to shit here.

02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:32.000
So I'd love that. Oh, all right. Um, well, if there's nothing else, I think we will move to

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.760
wrap up the show. Uh, actually wait, I should check in with Loki and see if there's any last

02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:41.520
minute stories. Yes. Let's talk about our favorite topic. NFTs.

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:53.280
Um, so apparently there was an NFT thing called block verse that launched that they sold an

02:17:53.280 --> 02:18:01.760
estimated $1.2 million worth of NFTs, about 10,000 of them. And they were basically like

02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:08.880
Minecraft skins, I guess. Oh yeah. There was some issue with it. Like, I don't know why they took

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:14.400
them down, but apparently they took them down at some point. And so now they're not accessible

02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:19.760
anymore. So you dropped all your money and you don't even have the crappy picture to look at.

02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:28.000
So you mean when things exist in a decentralized space, there's criminal activity and people that

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.360
don't follow through that exist. You mean in the wild, wild West, there were people that didn't

02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:42.640
follow the rule of law. Yeah. Oh my God. People are doing shitty things to steal other people's

02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:51.200
money on my internet. Yep. So, um,

02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:58.560
that's unfortunate. Like I said, you know, these skins even look terrible too. Just, um,

02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:01.680
you know, about the same amount of effort that, you know, was put into

02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:10.960
the, the yacht club apes or whatever. Um, just, I don't know. It looks procedurally generated.

02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:15.040
Bobby Blackwell and chat says they didn't break the law. Well, you know what? In the wild,

02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:27.280
wild West, I am the law and they broke me. Technically, technically you still own that

02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:34.560
link to the image. It's just that link to the image doesn't go anywhere. Technically,

02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:38.800
you got what you paid for just, you know, you got your little certificate.

02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:50.640
All right. No, nothing happier to end on Loki. Uh, no. Damn you. All right. That's all right.

02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:54.320
All right. Well, we'll try to get some happy final thoughts. Maybe, uh, we're going to go around,

02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:57.840
but first, uh, before I get everyone's final thought, I'm going to say thank you as always

02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:02.080
for tuning into orange launch radio, whether you were here live with us on Twitch on this lovely

02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:06.080
Sunday evening, uh, or you're listening to us on the podcast feed at some point throughout the

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:09.520
week. Thank you for being a part of our little family here at orange launch radio. Thank you

02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:15.280
for being part of the show and keeping us going for the last 20 years and over 900 episodes.

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:22.640
Now, you know, I can make that joke. It's over 900. I can do this. Wait till we get to 9,000.

02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:30.400
Um, I am the law. All right. Anyway, uh, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange

02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:34.480
launch radio, spread the word, help us spread the word, uh, because we are the show where

02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:38.320
every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here. So tell a friend or two. Um,

02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:42.560
even if you hated the show, I'd be surprised you got to this point if you hated the show, but Hey,

02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:47.200
some people hate watch things. What if I may say so for anyone who is here for the live show,

02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:52.160
make sure you host because that improves our algorithm.

02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:58.320
Yes. And sadly, auto hosts don't work anymore for whatever reason, uh, get better TTV,

02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:02.720
have it add the host button and you click the host button and you're done.

02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:08.480
Phil of nine and chat says, congrats on 9,000 episodes. Well, I trust him. He has a nine in

02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:14.560
his name. So I think we, uh, clearly Phil is the expert on nines dress to the nines

02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:20.080
comments to the nines nines, nines, nines across the board. All right. Anyway,

02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:23.520
uh, thank you. A 10 is speaking.

02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:30.400
Jamie suddenly rolls a new chat name. Jamie of 10.

02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:38.800
That's when Bobby shows up with Bobby of 11. Wait. All right.

02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:41.680
90,000 cookies is what you get after going on wish.

02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:48.160
All right. Um, thank you again as always for being here. Thank you. Help us spread the word.

02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:52.800
Uh, our discord server, vog network.com slash discord. Uh, I don't know what else to plug,

02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:56.160
so I'm just going to turn it over to final thoughts. Dark Sakura. I know you're, uh,

02:21:56.160 --> 02:22:00.480
going off to do your, um, killing and stabbings and all that stuff on dead by daylight.

02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:07.440
What is your final thought tonight? Um, I need three other people to play with me tonight so

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:11.600
that I can be convinced to get my Michaela adept. If not, then I'm just going to stab people.

02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:16.960
Ooh, I'm, I'm almost tempted if I didn't actually have things I need to do before work tomorrow.

02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:21.760
How very dare you, but hit me up during the week. If you change, if you decide to try again,

02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:27.280
well, I've got new days off now. All right. I'll be waiting. All right. Take care.

02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:33.360
All right. And we will go, we will go to Loki for your final thought.

02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:39.600
Uh, my final thought is I hope this cold goes away.

02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:48.160
Me too. Being sick is no fun. Um, my final thought is that I have my first

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:53.440
a one C check since all this diabetes stuff started a few months ago tomorrow.

02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:57.680
So everybody send good vibes. No way. I'm not ex I mean, I check my blood sugar. I know pretty

02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:03.600
much where I stand. Uh, I'm expecting the news to be good, but I want the news to be really good.

02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:09.360
So I will take your, uh, vibes and good juju and all that stuff. So appreciate that.

02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:14.160
Uh, and that's really it. Otherwise, I can't wait to do this again in seven days. I can't wait to

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:18.640
be in my new place. Uh, I can't believe it's less than a month away at this point. Today is

02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:23.680
officially the 30 day notice. Uh, although we told our current landlord a couple of weeks ago, just

02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:29.200
to be nice. Um, but yeah, I can't believe it. Very, very close. All right. That's it. We're done.

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:33.280
We're wrapping up. We're out of here. Uh, thank you for watching. Thank you for being a part of

02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:39.680
