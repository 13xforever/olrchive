0	14020	This week, I updated my Steam profile's featured screenshots to include a grab from
14020	18880	Electronic Superjoy that had a character saying, what's Zynga's favorite TV show?
18880	19880	Game of Clones!
19880	23960	Today, I see that Zynga is being acquired by Take-Two.
23960	27720	I hope the copycat Bonanza and acquisition of Sega's famed San Francisco headquarters
27720	30100	created a lot of value for shareholders.
30100	33160	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about
33160	35800	this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where
35800	36800	every gamer has a voice.
36800	37800	Hello, my friends.
37800	47600	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47600	53680	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back, and I hope we are back for a nice, long show
53680	56860	tonight with episode number 899.
56860	63980	For this January the 16th of 2022, our first, hopefully, real show of the year.
63980	69140	No medical issues, no internet issues, knock on wood, no weather issues, knock on wood,
69140	70140	knock on everything.
70140	73360	I am here, Rob Roberts, joining you with my co-host.
73360	76940	Say hello, as always, to the wonderful Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
76940	77940	Hi.
77940	79500	Hi, Jamie Summers.
79500	85260	And Jamie, please join me in giving props to our voiceover dude, VX Jason XV, because
85260	88380	he did an A-plus job tonight, I'm just saying.
88380	90380	He does great work.
90380	91380	He did.
91380	92380	He does.
92380	93380	He does.
93380	94380	How are you doing?
94380	95380	I'm all right.
95380	96380	Yeah?
96380	97380	All right.
97380	98380	A little sinacy.
98380	99380	Yeah, I can hear you a little sniffly.
99380	101160	It's not the big C, though, right?
101160	102160	I don't know.
102160	103160	Probably not.
103160	104160	All right.
104160	109180	I mean, I just started feeling a little bit crappy a couple days ago, but it's okay.
109180	110180	Okay.
110180	115140	I'm supposed to go back to work on the 19th, but we'll see.
115140	116140	All right.
116140	118780	Well, I hope everything gets back to normal for you.
118780	119780	Hey, the 19th.
119780	121300	That's a big day for me.
121300	122300	Oh, no, no.
122300	123900	No, no, yeah, this is the 19th.
123900	125220	Sorry, my days are all mixed up.
125220	127220	It is our anniversary of the 19th.
127220	128220	Yes.
128220	129220	In my head, I was like, the 17th.
129220	132220	No, wait, wait, no, the 19th.
132220	133220	All right.
133220	134220	Wednesday.
134220	135220	Yes.
135220	136220	The internet might work.
136220	137220	My brain may not.
137220	138220	Also, say hello.
138220	139220	Oh, Rob.
139260	140260	Oh, me.
140260	141980	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
141980	142980	Hello.
142980	144780	Hi, Loki.
144780	150260	I see you broadcasting a game play behind you because we do tape live every Sunday night
150260	154460	at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash
154460	160140	VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 9 Eastern, 6 Pacific.
160140	164660	And I see as we are broadcasting live here, you're playing some Mario Paint behind you.
164660	165660	Yeah.
166100	172100	Like earlier this week, I had like a game that came up and I was like, oh, yeah, I got
172100	174040	to do that for my background video.
174040	176100	And then today immediately forgot what that was.
176100	177100	So that's Mario Paint.
177100	180560	I'm like, oh, that would be perfect.
180560	183020	That would totally fit in with everything that we're talking about.
183020	184980	And then it's Mario Paint.
184980	185980	It is.
185980	189220	I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
189220	193920	SSU 100 Matt points out maybe part of my confusion, like the 17th being an important day.
193920	196960	That is what would have been Betty White's 100th birthday.
196960	200880	And SSU 100 Matt is reminding us the internet is calling for folks to donate to an animal
200880	202640	charity in her name tomorrow.
202640	203640	Love that idea.
203640	204640	Love it.
204640	213480	So I'm considering going to my PetSmart tomorrow and buying some bags of cat food for the kitties
213480	214480	that they house.
214480	215480	Oh, OK.
215480	216480	Nice.
216480	217480	We'll see.
217480	218480	Nice.
218480	219480	Nice.
219480	220480	All right.
220480	222840	Well, he's going there and harassing the cats.
222840	227820	Before we get into our kickoff topic tonight, I do want to address last week's show.
227820	229100	There's no nice way to say it.
229100	231460	It was a disaster.
231460	233600	It was just one of those things.
233600	235460	It was it was an awful week.
235460	238780	And you know, you do 900 shows as of next week.
238780	240620	There's going to be a few stinkers in there.
240620	242960	And it just sucks that a lot of it was out of our control.
242960	245520	And you know, it is what it is.
245520	249640	I apologize to the podcast folks because I didn't get the podcast up till really late
249640	250640	in the week.
250640	254140	My upload was still borked for several days after the show.
254140	259060	And that's what that's what was wrong is that my upload speed was, for whatever reason,
259060	260060	not working right.
260060	265260	I was getting like half a megabyte upload, which to get video out on Twitch, you need
265260	268100	like four K, five K, even like low video.
268100	272300	You need like two K. And I wasn't even getting that for upload.
272300	274460	So it really kind of hosed the show.
274460	277340	And then Dark Sakura was having webcam problems.
277340	282120	But honestly, those problems didn't really end up mattering because, uh oh, I think I
282120	285280	jinxed it because now she's got to plug it in.
285280	286280	I okay.
286280	287640	I didn't have to plug in anything.
287640	290160	I was adjusting it and turned on my lock screen.
290160	291160	Oh, okay.
291160	292160	All right.
292160	293160	Because I use my iPhone as my webcam.
293160	295280	I was like, oh, no, not again.
295280	296280	Yeah.
296280	297560	And I appreciate you guys in chat.
297560	298960	Dark Tetsuya says not your fault.
298960	300480	Pod Culture says not your fault.
300480	301480	Shit happens.
301480	302480	I know.
302480	303480	I know.
303620	308160	Continuing the theme tonight, because Bobby Black Wolf was beating up on himself earlier
308160	314060	for things during awesome games done quick, which there's no need to be awesome games
314060	317300	done quick was awesome games done quickly.
317300	321700	And they raised a lot of money, which we'll talk about later in the show, of course.
321700	325100	But now I beat myself up over issues that were out of my control and is what it is.
325100	330820	So finally they and of course, you know, I I filed a ticket and they wanted to send a
330820	335080	tech out here, but they didn't need to because somebody else figured out the problem.
335080	339160	So I had to cancel the tech because the problem just magically fixed itself on like Wednesday
339160	340400	or Thursday.
340400	343880	So anyway, I did run a bandwidth test before the show tonight.
343880	346640	We were able to maintain for 10 minutes.
346640	349120	So I'm hoping all is well.
349120	350120	It is what it is.
350120	352680	We're just going to push through and talk about video games.
352680	353680	All right.
353680	354680	Tested mine to make sure it's good.
354680	355680	Yes.
355680	356880	We're all testing.
356880	359740	So my upload is about 40 megabits.
359740	361280	So I'm happy.
361280	364680	Welcome to our real first show of 2022.
364680	366440	And Loki, you're feeling good, right?
366440	367840	Hopefully I'm fine.
367840	368840	Good.
368840	371860	Welcome to our first show of 2022.
371860	375320	Let's get into, of course, talking about what better thing to talk about for our first show
375320	378920	for 2022 than to go back and talk about 2021.
378920	382300	But I received a tweet this week that was like, hey, Rob, you guys going to talk about
382300	383300	your games of the year?
383300	387420	And I was like, oh, yeah, that was a that's a thing we should probably talk about around
387420	388420	this time.
388420	392960	So I want to open the floor and talk about what were your favorite, what was your favorite
392960	394840	game or your favorite games?
394840	396780	I'm not going to be very formal about it.
396780	399460	And I'll get into why when I get into my game.
399460	406400	But I just want to ask you, like, what were your like game or games of the year for 2021?
406400	408980	My game didn't come out last year.
408980	410120	And that's OK.
410120	416680	And I think this is a very important rule to set is that it's it's the game for you.
416680	419380	And no, but nobody can say that's right or wrong.
419380	423680	People can argue about critic lists all they want and like the definitive top hundred of
423680	426080	all time because everybody's list is going to be different.
426080	428980	So it's really like, what was it for you?
428980	432440	So Dark Soccer, since you kind of started there and you're saying it's not something
432440	436400	from this year, what is your game of the year or games?
436400	440560	I am going to say it's Dead by Daylight just because I played the most of it and I've had
440560	445140	the most fun playing it and I've met the best people playing it.
445140	450660	So the game overall has been.
450660	458320	Great for me, even though it makes me curse like a freaking sailor, you know, but I've
458320	467660	had a great time playing it and the game itself is different than, you know, the.
467660	472500	The original release of it, obviously, I mean, they've made some changes and there's graphic
472500	479660	updates and even the mechanics in the game are different than they were, you know, on
479660	481540	its original release.
481540	486960	So yeah, I'm going to say say that and Fantasian.
486960	489460	See I was I thought you'd say Fantasian.
489460	492500	I mean, no one is surprised to hear Dead by Daylight.
492500	493500	Nobody is surprised to hear that.
493500	498740	I'm sure like I just knowing you like that game, I feel like has been transformative
498740	501100	for your online presence.
501100	505740	And I mean that as a compliment, like like you're you're motivated on Twitch in a way
505740	508100	I've never seen you before.
508100	509100	You're not.
509100	510100	I got bullied off Twitch before.
510100	511100	Yeah.
511100	512100	And people are idiots.
512100	514940	And but I'm glad you got back on the horse.
514940	523780	And maybe we have other, you know, women, other people of color, other trans folks.
523780	526220	I'm calling out the marginalized folks out there.
526220	531500	I think maybe we have a lot of them to thank for, you know, putting up with a lot of the
531500	538380	bullshit and make taking a hold of this platform and saying, we're not letting go.
538380	539620	We're not going anywhere.
539620	542500	Our voices are going to be heard, come together like no other.
542500	544900	And it's transferring over to VHS.
544900	545900	Yeah.
545900	552700	Which, you know, I actually messaged the VHS devs because I mean, that's another one that
552700	554100	I would love to play.
554100	555100	It looks like a lot of fun.
555100	561100	I've been enjoying watching my friends play it and a little bit jealous.
561100	563940	But that one also just looks like it's super fun.
563940	565620	The community has been really supportive.
565620	567820	I haven't had the degree of toxicity.
567820	569460	I haven't noticed it.
569460	571180	Amongst some of the player base.
571180	576380	Then again, it is, you know, it's in a beta, a closed beta.
576380	583860	But I would even put that as like, if I had to say something that came out quote, because,
583860	586660	you know, it was in beta at the end of the year.
586660	591020	I'd say VHS would probably be up there in the new game category, even though I haven't
591020	592020	played it.
592020	593780	It looks like it's a lot of fun.
593780	594780	Very 80s-tastic.
594780	595780	Yeah.
595780	600040	I've, I've, I've watched some of the streamers you and I both watch because we're always
600040	601180	watching the same person.
601180	603420	It seems play that game.
603420	608700	Well, I think that some of our mutual friends have just thought it was hilarious by now
608700	611180	that we kind of read about it.
611180	612180	I'm sure.
612180	617820	I get VHS yet, like the play of it, but it's, it's because I just, I need to play it until
617820	619580	I like really understand it.
619580	621340	It's just, yeah, whatever.
621340	626220	The thing is, is it's, you're crafting stun weapons or kill weapons and the teens are
626220	630220	stuck in like a teen movie with one of them turning into the monster.
630220	631220	I love the aesthetic.
631220	632220	I love the aesthetic.
632220	636460	The teens have to kill the monster or the monster kills the teens.
636460	638440	So this is a game where you fight back.
638440	643080	And apparently the communication is definitely the key in this game.
643080	646800	Like way much more because in Dead by Daylight, you can sort of like, if you're solo queue,
646800	650120	you can sort of just, you know, fuck around and do your own thing and maybe still make
650120	651880	it out of the game.
651880	657120	But I've noticed in VHS, if there's not communication, if one falls, all fall.
657120	658120	Yeah.
658120	659120	Yeah.
659120	660120	Okay.
660120	661760	So that's kind of my take on it.
661760	669640	But I've, I did actually reach out to the, on their Twitter to see if there were any
669640	674720	plans for a Mac release or if it runs in Windows ARM, because I'm running Windows 11 ARM in
674720	679080	Parallels and there's still some games that, that won't play on it.
679080	685800	And I'm actually really irritated at the anti-cheat that Dead by Daylight uses because the anti-cheat
685800	690560	doesn't run in an ARM environment, but Dead by Daylight does.
690560	694880	And when I try to run the game without the anti-cheat, it tells me I'm not connected
694880	695880	to Steam.
695880	696880	Right.
696880	697880	Right.
697880	700920	So, and I haven't been able to figure any way around it so I can actually play it on
700920	708800	Steam instead, but honestly enough, I'm still pretty happy with Stadia.
708800	713400	There's just been, I've found, you know, a few games since I've just got really, I got
713400	716160	a little bit bored with Dead by Daylight and started trying to stream some other stuff
716160	719880	and Cyberpunk 2077 is actually not really to my liking.
719880	722880	I don't like first person games.
722880	725120	I saw you playing something really random the other night.
725120	726120	I can't remember what it was.
726120	727120	Demons Tilt?
727120	729480	No, it was something else.
729480	730480	Oh, Muse Dash.
730480	733240	Yeah, I saw you playing Muse Dash.
733240	734240	I love Muse Dash.
734240	737800	Muse Dash is pretty fun and really simple, but I'm also playing it on my iPhone so I
737800	744000	don't always want to, it's a little bit interesting to play like through Steam, but it's fun.
744000	745000	Don't get me wrong.
745000	747440	I love the music in it.
747440	753520	But I'm also, though, I'd have to say that like the best RPG that I have played in the
753520	759200	last several years, though, I'm going to put Fantasian up on that list because the story
759200	762920	is really good.
762920	769040	I've made it through a lot of combat for the game really easily, but the boss battles are
769040	771280	harder than advertised.
771280	778800	It's definitely something that you're going to have to redo your growth path in the game.
778800	784920	Like you can actually channel your skill points into different skills on a branching tree.
784920	790200	And I've actually had to go in and redo entire sets of them for some of the battles in the
790200	791600	game.
791600	797120	Like there's one that I have to take all of, I have counter on most of the characters because
797120	802080	typically having counter is really good, it's extra attack, but I had to turn off counter
802080	808840	for all of this one battle because if you hit one of the little sub creatures, it causes
808840	813840	a chain reaction to make all of them explode and then it will kill you.
813840	819160	So you have to do this like vacuum skill that sucks them all off to the side so that you
819160	824640	don't accidentally hit one when you hit the main baddie because some people have piercing
824640	828960	attacks that will go through lines of characters.
828960	834880	And the way that you can chain and pierce your attacks, it is so unique.
834880	842560	Not to mention the backgrounds and the levels are all hand-built diorama.
842560	849360	So there's a lot of care that went into that game and it's a care I haven't seen in a game
849360	850480	in quite some time.
850480	852200	So I'm pretty happy with it.
852200	855260	You're not the first to really rave about that game.
855260	858520	One of my other friends says that that's his favorite game of the entire year too, who
858520	859520	plays a lot of RPGs.
859520	861400	So I really trust his opinion.
861400	866420	Not that I don't trust yours, but I just seeing it in multiple places when I don't think a
866420	871520	ton of people are playing that game because it is limited to Apple Arcade right now.
871520	872520	And I'm not sure.
872520	873520	You can play it on your iPhone.
873520	878400	Oh yeah, I know, but I'm not sure a lot of people are exploring that.
878400	882100	Actually I'll just go ahead and say this right now.
882100	890780	You can use my Apple Arcade subscription on the, uh, on the, uh, uh, OLR account.
890780	891780	I'll get around to it eventually.
891780	893180	My backlog is gigantic.
893180	895180	That's just one of many games sitting in my backlog right now.
895180	898300	This has superseded a lot of different games that I've acquired.
898300	899300	I get it.
899300	902420	Um, although I did buy battle of the gods.
902420	905020	It's by the same people that do battle of the animals.
905020	906020	Hmm.
906020	910260	Um, you can play Jesus versus Santa Claus.
910260	919140	It's very sacrilegious and I'm kind of, I'm kind of like, I don't believe in disrespecting
919140	927820	faiths, but at the same time, you know, the old, uh, Southern Baptist, sorry, there's
927820	929020	something flying around.
929020	931980	There's the old Southern Baptist in me.
931980	939380	That's just sort of like getting a kick at knocking, you know, all right.
939420	940420	Sorry.
940420	941420	Not, not knocking Midna.
941420	945820	She just jumped down and made a noise, but, but you know what I mean?
945820	948820	That's God telling you to watch it.
948820	952100	Cat, stop it.
952100	953100	All right.
953100	954100	She's okay.
954100	955100	Sorry.
955100	956100	She's, she's getting into stuff.
956100	960660	Let me, uh, let me go over to Loki and it, cause I, I actually have no idea what Loki's
960660	961660	going to answer this with.
961660	965780	Uh, so I'm, I'm super curious, uh, your game or games of the year.
965780	966780	Loki.
966780	968500	Oh, my, my games.
968500	975100	Um, well, I didn't play that many this year, so, um, I mean, I guess if I can do like a
975100	982460	top three or something, uh, we can do power washing SIM cause that's, that's awesome.
982460	985900	That's, that's a pick that was going through my head too.
985900	986900	Absolutely.
986900	992660	So yeah, power washing simulator, uh, hotshots racing, pretty cool.
992660	993660	Yep.
993660	995460	Uh, that was pretty solid racing game.
995460	1000580	Um, I mean, obviously Minecraft and my game.
1000580	1001580	Sure.
1001580	1007260	I was, I was going to put pixel poops number two on my list, but then it was like conflict
1007260	1008260	of interest.
1008260	1009260	What?
1009260	1010260	It's fine.
1010260	1011260	Ethics.
1011260	1012260	What?
1012260	1013260	All right.
1013260	1019340	And that's probably like the only games that I, I played this year.
1019340	1023060	So that's, I mean, that's going to be it.
1023180	1027740	Um, for me, um, so I have kind of like three different answers.
1027740	1031900	It's not a top three, but the three different mindsets I've been in and approaching this
1031900	1033020	question.
1033020	1036660	And at first I was like, all right, if I'm going to just do the traditional pick, I mean,
1036660	1041980	I also, I kind of feel like Loki, I haven't played a lot, a lot of games this year.
1041980	1047460	That doesn't mean I, I dislike gaming or I should be unqualified from talking about video
1047460	1048460	gaming.
1048460	1051900	I just feel like a lot of the old standbys, a lot of the gold classics have really carried
1051900	1057020	me through this year and I haven't been very adventurous exploring a lot of new titles.
1057020	1060780	Um, and I think there's a lot of factors that play into that and that's just the way it
1060780	1061940	is that made up my year.
1061940	1065700	It doesn't make me any less of a gaming fan just because I'm playing classics.
1065700	1070260	Um, but I think, you know, if I were to take this question from a traditional perspective,
1070260	1075100	I'd probably say, eh, probably Forza Horizon 5, you know, it was a game I was super hyped
1075100	1079700	about, loved Forza Horizon 4, Forza Horizon 5 is like more of the same and is that a bad
1079700	1080700	thing?
1080700	1081700	Absolutely not.
1081700	1083540	There's so much to see and do in that game.
1083540	1084800	It's great.
1084800	1088380	But the more I kind of thought about it, like honestly, I was, I was totally prepared to
1088380	1094680	come into the show tonight and give the big spiel about why I think the, the 2022 game
1094680	1095680	of the year.
1095680	1100140	I mean, there's, there's been a lot of not, excuse me, the 2021 game of the year that
1100140	1101820	we're talking about in 2022.
1101820	1106540	Um, I honestly think there's been a lot of stuff this year that's not great about gaming.
1107380	1112020	Um, from the technical and logistical perspective of, I still can't go into target and get a
1112020	1113420	PlayStation five.
1113420	1115100	These things are still being scalped.
1115100	1118580	Same thing with series X series S I guess is getting a little bit easier.
1118580	1123420	I mean, you can buy those on Woot now, but you know, for the most part, the next generation
1123420	1126500	of gaming is still inaccessible for a lot of people.
1126500	1132520	And you put on top of that, the fact that, um, there's been a lot of bullshit in our
1132520	1137560	industry that's really floated to the top, um, this year between what's going on with
1137560	1139760	Activision blizzard, Ubisoft.
1139760	1145520	I mean, we talked about it weeks and weeks on the show and the reckoning needed to happen.
1145520	1150320	But the fact that a lot of this bullshit is still out there and exacerbated by the fact
1150320	1155160	that Bobby Kotick is still the CEO of Activision for some stupid reason.
1155160	1159240	Um, I honestly was ready to walk in here tonight and say, I think the game of the year for
1159240	1161760	2021 is nothing.
1161760	1167080	And I think for the 20 years we've been doing this show, I think I probably would be fully
1167080	1171520	justified in saying, I think this year, more than any other, nothing deserves to be the
1171520	1173080	game of the year.
1173080	1177660	Um, and it's not to say that every game that came out there year was bad.
1177660	1182480	That's not what I'm saying, but I'm just saying our industry is, is not in a great point.
1182480	1188320	And there was nothing that really grabbed me away from the old reliables, the old comfort
1188320	1190280	foods.
1190280	1196120	And I'm not sure 2021 was very successful in pushing things forward in the industry.
1196120	1199240	In fact, it felt like a step backwards.
1199240	1205680	So in a way, honestly, in many ways, my answer is 2021's game of the year is nothing.
1205680	1211400	Um, but then I, I really, really, really, really, really thought about it and I've kind
1211400	1216880	of thought about, okay, if this is supposed to be my game of the year and me and the things
1216880	1220980	I've been going through and the things that I like, and a lot of the stuff that has been
1220980	1225840	very important to me in my journey with a lot of the health issues I've talked about,
1225840	1231220	um, in the past couple months, cause it really has been just the past few months and so forth.
1231220	1237800	I think I've landed on that my personal game of the year is Pikmin Bloom, um, which probably
1237800	1238840	isn't that surprising.
1238840	1242980	I've always been a shill of some sorts for Niantic games just because I've really enjoyed
1242980	1245680	things like Ingress, um, Pokemon Go.
1245680	1249440	Um, heck, I played that Harry Potter game when it first came out before, you know, You
1249440	1251680	Know Who was all over Twitter and we're not going to go there.
1251680	1255320	Uh, I really was looking forward to the Catan, uh, and there are other releases.
1255320	1256320	So, um, yeah, sure.
1256320	1259480	Of course, there's always going to be that element of, and even non Niantic things like
1259480	1260480	Orna.
1260480	1266540	Um, I've always been super into like the GPS phone games, but I think Pikmin, while still
1266540	1272120	having a ways to go and making that game better and a more, um, quality product, I think there's
1272120	1276940	some game balance, some serious game balance issues and shop, uh, micro transaction balance
1276940	1278560	issues the game has to address.
1278560	1281960	And it's, it's really echoing a lot of the same stuff that's all over Reddit and all
1281960	1282960	of that.
1282960	1288800	But I think what the game has done very well is very well is it's done a very good job
1288800	1295800	incentivizing walking without making it feel like too much, because let's be real in Ingress.
1295800	1299280	A lot of people don't walk most of those portals and things that you got, you don't really
1299280	1300280	walk to them.
1300280	1302520	People are using their cars, their drive-bys.
1302520	1307160	So yes, some portals are harder to get to than others and you have to walk to get them.
1307160	1308160	Sure.
1308160	1313280	Um, but you know, and I, I spent, especially those darn ones behind, you know, locked gates
1313280	1314280	and property.
1314280	1320720	I'm just saying, and I've spent more hours than, um, than not, uh, you know, playing
1320720	1324680	Ingress probably, you know, so far, I'm not like knocking the game, but it's just, I,
1324680	1327680	you don't really walk and get exercise playing that game.
1327680	1330640	Um, Pokemon Go, same thing.
1330640	1332120	It's a lot of drive-bys.
1332120	1337240	It's a lot of, you know, that sort of thing in your car, catching Pokemon and maybe community
1337240	1339280	days kind of get you out walking around.
1339280	1345000	But even then there's a lot of stop, catch, go, stop, catch, go, stop, catch, go, right?
1345000	1348840	Like Pokemon isn't really about the fitness for a lot of people.
1348840	1354980	I think Pikmin has found that really good balance where you set it, forget it and move
1354980	1357180	to get your rewards.
1357180	1362020	And again, I don't think the game is perfect, but I'm just saying that I've walked a half
1362020	1366100	a million steps in the last couple months.
1366100	1371140	And this is the time more than anything I've needed incentive to keep me good and keep
1371140	1375640	me on this track I've been on and Pikmin Bloom's been able to do that for me.
1375640	1380560	So I think in many ways, the game is probably like the right place at the right time sort
1380560	1385760	of thing, but I'm not going to apologize for the fact that those factors make it my favorite
1385760	1387500	game of the year.
1387500	1391120	So that's my answer.
1391120	1394340	Looking at some comments in chat, Tiger Claw says, give it to Nintendo.
1394340	1395340	What about Metroid Dread?
1395340	1397340	I did give it to Nintendo.
1397340	1399340	I love Metroid.
1399340	1404660	I haven't finished Dread yet because I had some pain playing it.
1404660	1411660	The control issues in that game, hold it back from being number one for me a little bit.
1411680	1415800	Adris in chat says Endwalker for me.
1415800	1416800	Great answer.
1416800	1417800	I love Endwalker.
1417800	1419180	I love Final Fantasy 14.
1419180	1421920	I hate the sound issues that still aren't fixed.
1421920	1423480	Hopefully they're supposed to be in the next patch.
1423480	1427760	I hate the cue issues that have arisen.
1427760	1428760	I still love Endwalker.
1428760	1434520	I still love Final Fantasy 14, but I'm not sure I felt as good about it as I did Shadow
1434520	1441040	Bringers, which was in my top three the year that came out.
1441420	1442420	And Black Compat in chat.
1442420	1443420	Hi there.
1443420	1445300	I hope everybody's following your channel, by the way.
1445300	1447340	Black Compat says Ubi, Acti, Bungie.
1447340	1450060	So much Kaka duty going on in the industry.
1450060	1451060	Absolutely.
1451060	1456220	And that's why I think in many ways, like the maybe the game of the year, I know I said
1456220	1463540	nothing, but maybe the game of the year needs to be the workers, the frontline workers,
1463540	1467340	the people that need the credit and do the work for what's going on.
1467340	1472960	And I'm not sure exactly how to articulate that, because I know nothing sounds like a
1472960	1477040	big negative, but I think I say that more like the industry kind of needs to take a
1477040	1478600	look at itself sort of thing.
1478600	1479600	That makes sense.
1479600	1480600	I don't know.
1480600	1481600	Anyway.
1481600	1482600	OK.
1482600	1484740	So that was looking backward.
1484740	1486000	Let's look forward.
1486000	1487280	What do we predict?
1487280	1492440	Now we're not in person, so I don't have the little robot and all that stuff, but we can
1492440	1499560	always make a clip out of this Darth Vader 10 and revisit it later of our 2022 predictions.
1499560	1505160	So I'm curious, what do you guys think is going to happen in the industry in 2022?
1505160	1509380	Do you have any safe predictions or outrageous predictions?
1509380	1510380	What are your guesses?
1510380	1512080	So Dark Sakura, I'll start with you again.
1512080	1515860	What is one prediction you have about the games industry for 2022?
1515860	1520680	As much as I hate it, they are still going to try to pull this NFT bullshit.
1520680	1523120	The NFT bullshit is not going to slow down.
1523120	1524120	Interesting.
1524120	1526720	Because I know we have a story coming up on that later.
1526720	1527720	We do.
1527720	1529920	That indicates companies don't learn.
1529920	1530920	Interesting.
1530920	1531920	OK.
1531920	1538720	I think that they're going to find some other way to make it attractive or just do it anyway.
1538720	1541120	And people are going to want to play certain things.
1541120	1545720	You're going to do it with the with the irresistible title.
1545720	1547460	I think there is something to that.
1547460	1553520	And I tend to agree that they're going to force the narrative to be NFTs are a success
1553520	1557560	because they're going to tie it to something that's not going to fail.
1557560	1561140	They're going to tie it to make it sound like they're spending their in-game currency.
1561140	1562140	Yes.
1562140	1563140	To buy a thing.
1563140	1564140	Yes.
1564140	1569180	But they have to spend money to buy their in-game currency.
1569180	1575060	And they will own this thing, yes, because it is an NFT, but it has in the end cost actual
1575060	1578860	money for them to acquire the points to buy the item.
1578860	1581340	And as far as they know, it's in game.
1581340	1582620	It's an in-game item.
1582620	1583620	They'll tie.
1583620	1585560	They're going to make it entirely deceptive.
1585560	1591900	They'll tie FIFA packs to NFTs or something like that and say, oh, look at what a success
1591900	1595260	NFTs are when it's like people weren't buying it for that.
1595260	1597140	They're buying it for other stuff.
1597140	1598140	Right.
1598140	1601180	So that's where I think it's going to go.
1601180	1602180	OK.
1602180	1604140	It's going to have to become a deceptive practice.
1604220	1609180	Just kind of like how loot crates, you know, were a fairly deceptive practice.
1609180	1610260	All right.
1610260	1611260	I get it.
1611260	1612260	I'm with you there.
1612260	1613820	I kind of agree with that one.
1613820	1616980	Loki, what about one of yours?
1616980	1621420	Bobby Kotick is still going to be CEO of Activision Blizzard and he's going to even receive more
1621420	1622420	money this year.
1622420	1623420	I hate that.
1623420	1624420	I hate it.
1624420	1626340	I don't disagree.
1626340	1630700	It's ridiculous for me.
1630700	1631700	Let's see.
1631700	1632700	I'm going to predict.
1633260	1636460	If Loki is going to take a safe one, I'm going to play a safe one, too.
1636460	1641540	I think there will be a new Xbox series underscore for the holiday.
1641540	1648460	I think this latest Xbox thing was kind of designed to do that, where they're going to
1648460	1652740	release another thing in the series line is kind of like maybe the Xbox Pro or something
1652740	1653740	like that.
1653740	1654740	I don't know.
1654740	1655740	But I think I think that would be a thing.
1655740	1659060	I predict there's going to be an Xbox series.
1659060	1660540	Why or something this year?
1660540	1668660	I'll say X-Box series, double X, the Xbox series, triple X. All right.
1668660	1671460	Any more anyone wants to throw out there?
1671460	1680820	I'll open this up to our chatters as well.
1680820	1681820	I don't know.
1681820	1689780	Like, it's just it's the same disappointment all year round.
1689780	1694060	S.S.G.A. 100 Matt says, will you be able to go into a store and get a PlayStation 5 this
1694060	1695060	year?
1695060	1696060	No.
1696060	1697060	No.
1697060	1702860	I think we're I think it'll still go the whole way to and I think that the VR thing
1702860	1705020	is going to have the same problem.
1705020	1711460	And I also think this is why and I'm going to say no Nintendo Switch upgrade this year
1711460	1715380	or well, no major Nintendo Switch upgrade this year.
1715380	1720580	They'll do something like, you know, LED, you know, something that's that's minorly
1720580	1721580	incremental.
1721580	1727820	But I predict no major switch update until I think they'll go with the off season again.
1727820	1729740	Nintendo doesn't need to be on the holiday.
1729740	1732420	I say March 2023.
1732420	1733420	I got one.
1733420	1735140	I got one.
1735140	1736140	OK.
1736140	1740740	The Intellivision MECO isn't coming out this year, and in fact, they don't release it.
1740740	1744300	They just canceled the project.
1744300	1752620	OK, OK, OK.
1752620	1753620	Let's see.
1753620	1758740	She Hulk in chat says game pass on Switch 2022.
1758740	1761420	There's something about that that doesn't click for me.
1761420	1764500	Like what does Nintendo have to gain from that?
1764500	1766740	That's the only thing that doesn't like like I want to see it.
1766740	1767740	Don't get me wrong.
1767740	1772620	I'm just not sure I understand what Nintendo would really get from that unless there's
1772620	1777420	something to be said about like Nintendo games on the Xbox platform, which makes absolutely
1777420	1778420	no sense.
1778420	1779420	I love that.
1779420	1781900	Yeah, like maybe money, I guess.
1781900	1785740	Yeah, maybe they throw a shitload of money at it.
1785740	1786740	Maybe.
1786740	1787740	Come on.
1787740	1788740	Pull a Sega.
1788740	1789740	It worked well for them.
1789740	1790740	Right.
1790740	1791740	Hey.
1791740	1797340	Adrian chat says attempt to tie games into the metaverse virtual spaces.
1797340	1798900	Oh, I kind of like that.
1798900	1799900	You know what?
1799900	1801860	I'll go with a crazy pick along those lines.
1801860	1809140	I'm going to say that long rumored PlayStation home reboot for VR is a VR to launch thing.
1809140	1810140	Why not?
1810140	1811140	I'll go.
1811140	1812140	I'll go.
1812140	1815480	The PlayStation home reboot is a VR to thing.
1815480	1818540	I'll go with that.
1818540	1820540	I like that one.
1820540	1826860	OK, last call anymore.
1826860	1832660	World predictions, Sony, Microsoft, PlayStation, the rest of the industry arcades.
1832660	1835960	I think Stadia is going to keep going strong.
1835960	1840940	So Google will continue to invest in Stadia when a lot of people said they would throw
1840940	1841940	it away by now.
1841940	1849220	Yeah, I mean, indeed, there hasn't been any sort of notice about them slowing down with
1849220	1850220	it.
1850220	1852980	It apparently still seems to be making money.
1852980	1857660	And there is quite a bit of a following around it now.
1857660	1859100	The cult of Stadia grows.
1859100	1862420	OK, I got some great games on there, too.
1862420	1864700	I mean, I'll just put it out there.
1864700	1869140	And then Epic is going to continue to bite off of everybody else's ideas.
1869140	1870140	You know what, though?
1870140	1874620	I was just going to say Dark Soccer talking about Stadia, I think maybe answered the question
1874620	1875620	for me.
1875620	1879220	What could Nintendo and Microsoft have to gain from a game pass partnership?
1879260	1886660	I think if Nintendo is able to have a Microsoft cloud player, I think that's what it would
1886660	1887660	be.
1887660	1889540	Not Game Pass directly, reinstall the games.
1889540	1896440	But if Nintendo Switch devices had a Microsoft cloud player on them to play Game Pass games.
1896440	1900420	Because Microsoft, I don't think, is interested in that portable gaming space.
1900420	1901420	We've never seen them go.
1901420	1903780	I mean, yes, they have tablets, sure.
1903780	1911240	But they realize, Phil Spencer and many people at Microsoft realize the Nintendo Switch has
1911240	1919180	broken through in a way that no Windows Phone or Surface tablet or any of Microsoft's to-go
1919180	1921780	products are ever going to get to.
1921780	1927380	And I think if Microsoft, maybe the alliance is, they'll do advertising for Nintendo Switch
1927380	1929980	because Nintendo Switch plays the Microsoft cloud platform.
1929980	1932940	I think that's where the agreement could ultimately be.
1932940	1937340	So I will say, you gave me that aha moment in talking about Stadia.
1937340	1940940	I think that's the win for that alliance happening.
1942940	1947900	Ooh, Mike Deftonchat says, E3 will turn into Summer Games Fest.
1947900	1951040	ESA will let Jeff just do it all for them next year.
1951040	1954100	Bobby Blackwolf says, the ESA wouldn't do that at this point.
1954100	1955580	Too much animosity.
1955580	1957140	They'll go under first.
1957140	1958140	Thank you.
1958140	1959140	That's a great prediction.
1959140	1960940	The ESA goes under in 2023.
1962940	1970500	There is no E3 2023 because people finally realize the ESA is a horribly managed organization
1970500	1976580	that has grown behind the curve for far too long and has not been able to innovate in
1976580	1979740	a way that a tech company needs to be able to innovate.
1979740	1982580	So I think, thank you, Bobby.
1982580	1988620	I think that's a pretty, maybe we're a little ways out, but I think there is no talk of
1988620	1992620	ever returning to an in-person E3, and it has nothing to do with COVID.
1995620	1996620	Let's see.
1996620	2000580	Dark Tetsuya says, I know Switch does have a few cloud-based games, so if they could
2000580	2003180	set up a full-on service for it, sure.
2003180	2006940	Yes, I think there's a lot of good stuff there.
2006940	2010940	Mike Deftonchat says, I would have gone with my yearly prediction of E3 and ESA disappearing,
2010940	2012660	but it would have been three years in a row now.
2012660	2014860	This is the year to do it, Deft.
2014860	2015860	This is the year.
2016100	2020620	S2 100 Matt says, the new Saints Row game comes out and Loki likes it.
2020620	2024140	I'm not sure if that's a safe prediction.
2024140	2026900	I think it's a wishful one.
2026900	2029620	I mean, I'll probably play it.
2029620	2031660	I mean, I'm definitely going to play it.
2031660	2032660	I would hope so.
2032660	2034660	It's like you're serious.
2034660	2039100	Yeah, it is.
2039100	2042580	And after all, like, you know, what am I going to do, wait until Grand Theft Auto 6 comes
2042580	2043580	out?
2043580	2044580	I mean, come on.
2045300	2046300	Yikes.
2046300	2047300	All right.
2047300	2051900	I mean, it's just going to take, like, several decades for them to release it.
2051900	2052900	OK, OK.
2052900	2055380	Make this 2022 prediction then.
2055380	2059100	Do we see a frame of Grand Theft Auto 6?
2059100	2060100	No.
2060100	2061100	OK.
2061100	2062100	None.
2062100	2063100	Zero.
2063100	2066900	There'll be no announcements for Grand Theft Auto 6.
2066900	2068780	All right.
2068780	2072780	Let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have
2072780	2074580	been playing this week.
2074580	2076180	And we'll start with Dark Sakura.
2076180	2077780	How was your gaming week?
2077780	2079980	I played a lot of Dead by Daylight.
2079980	2087500	I played 12 and a half hours of Dead by Daylight on Wednesday, and nobody really did anything.
2087500	2089100	I was lurking for a little bit.
2089100	2095860	Yeah, but I was, you know, trying to do a joinathon, hopefully, you know, get some more
2095860	2096860	people interested.
2096860	2100260	And I did get three adepts, though, by the way.
2100260	2101260	There you go.
2101260	2107020	I adapted Legion, I adapted Trickster and Clown.
2107020	2110820	The thing is, is that I still have, like, 10 cakes left on Trickster, so I have to play
2110820	2117140	him some more to use up those cakes before I, what's the word, prestige him?
2117140	2119020	And I've been prestige-ing characters.
2119020	2125060	So to date, the adepts that I have, and keep in mind, I am a mediocre player, so me getting
2125060	2127940	any kind of adept is, like, a big deal for me.
2127940	2134620	So I have Clown, Doctor, Ghostface, Hag, Huntress, which I did nothing but M1 Huntress.
2134620	2136980	I didn't throw a single hatchet.
2136980	2142900	I had a challenge to hit 10 people with just the regular axe.
2142900	2146700	So I put on that thing that gives her, like, great movement speed when she doesn't have
2146700	2151520	any hatchets, and then that thing that reduces her hatchets to one hatchet.
2151520	2156140	So I got rid of my one hatchet, and I was instantly fast.
2156140	2160260	And it was funny that people afterwards thought that it was hilarious.
2160260	2162020	So I had a lot of fun.
2162020	2167460	I also got, so I had Legion, Nightmare, Nurse, which I either had really new people because
2167460	2173260	they were all Ash, or they were memeing, and that was fine.
2173260	2176700	I don't mind them helping me get adept because that means I don't have to try on Nurse ever
2176700	2177700	again.
2177700	2178700	Yeah.
2178700	2181540	And Trapper and Trickster, like I said, so those are the ones that I have.
2181540	2184900	I'm working on Pig right now, which is...
2184900	2186180	That's a hard one, I hear.
2186180	2187180	It's a hard one.
2187180	2188180	Her perks suck.
2188180	2189180	I don't think I have a lot of adept killers.
2189180	2192220	I've only done as well as I have because I'm decent at Pig.
2192220	2196180	I have a lot of adept survivors because all you have to do is get out, and you just, sometimes
2196180	2200060	you luck out, and you just have a killer that can't get you, and you get out and you get
2200060	2201140	the adept.
2201140	2206260	But killer ones are hard because you have to, like, you have to play a max game, basically.
2206260	2210100	You have to double pip with only their base talents, which is tricky.
2210100	2214020	You have to be way on top of your game, and I think it's highly imbalanced.
2214020	2216060	I think it should be Blood Points.
2216060	2222380	Yeah, and I don't think any killer, their three set base perk set is good.
2222380	2224700	I don't think any killer has all three.
2224700	2226500	I was gonna say Hag.
2226500	2228940	I was gonna say Hag probably is the quote-unquote easiest.
2228940	2233060	In fact, I think I might have adept Hag, so.
2233060	2238860	And I will just say this, that the easiest of them all for me to get was Trapper.
2238860	2239860	First try.
2239860	2240860	Interesting.
2240860	2246300	First try, but I lucked into the survivors that I got.
2246300	2250700	And they were basically just letting me practice blinking the entire time.
2250700	2252820	Like until I could get my blinks down.
2252820	2261740	Sorry to interrupt, but of course, because you guys had to all jinx it for us for 2022,
2261740	2265740	we just got the power company coming to our door saying that they're gonna shut the power
2265740	2269020	off at some point for an hour.
2269020	2272420	Thanks, you guys.
2272420	2273420	Tonight?
2273420	2274420	Tonight.
2274420	2275420	Anytime.
2275420	2278780	Because they're working on something.
2278780	2280740	So thank you, 2022.
2280740	2283700	We're just never gonna have a show, I guess, or a full show.
2283700	2285700	I hate it here.
2285700	2290020	All right, we'll get through as much as we can, and at least when we lose, Loki will
2290020	2291020	know why.
2291020	2292020	Jesus.
2292020	2293020	Yeah.
2293020	2294020	All right, Loki.
2294020	2295100	For fuck's sake.
2295100	2296100	Dark soccer.
2296100	2299420	I don't mean to cut you off, but we probably should get to Loki's game a week.
2299420	2300420	I'll finish mine after Loki.
2300420	2302660	Okay, Loki, how was your game a week?
2302660	2306420	It's all Minecraft and debugging stuff with our server, trying to figure out why it's
2306420	2307580	laggy.
2307580	2308580	No idea.
2308580	2309580	Still trying to figure it out.
2309580	2310580	Is it running on Comcast?
2310580	2311580	I put out my new episode, though.
2311580	2312580	I think there's a new episode out.
2312580	2314780	I did see a new YouTube in our Discord server.
2314780	2315780	Oh, yeah.
2315780	2316780	So check that out.
2316780	2317780	Okay, awesome.
2317780	2319580	All right, Jamie, go ahead and finish up.
2319580	2323500	I also played Demon's Tilt.
2323500	2327140	That game is super fun.
2327140	2328940	And of course, Fantasian.
2328940	2334300	How can I leave out Fantasian, which I don't know what it is, but two of the boss battles
2334300	2338940	that were giving me the biggest fits, I just blew them away.
2338940	2341380	They were easy after that.
2341380	2344900	And then I got to a place that I'm not supposed to do yet.
2344900	2349420	So I played a little bit of it, and I'm backtracking some.
2349420	2350420	What?
2350420	2351420	All right.
2351420	2353780	But it's fun.
2353780	2354780	It's really great.
2354780	2357900	Everyone should play it.
2357900	2358900	My gaming week.
2358900	2361660	Honestly, with the internet issues, it kind of cut into some stuff.
2361660	2368820	So I didn't get to play a whole lot, but I did play some Final Fantasy XIV, of course.
2368820	2373540	So my Gunbreaker got through the main scenario and is level 90.
2373540	2376620	That all happened weeks ago, but now my Bard is level 90 as well.
2376620	2378500	Bard's a lot of fun to play this time around.
2378500	2381240	I've been kind of sleeping on it the last couple of expansions, but Bard's really cool
2381240	2382240	this time.
2382240	2386080	So I got Bard to 90, and then I've been working on crafting gatherings.
2386080	2390360	So my minor botanist and then four of my crafters are all level 90 as well.
2390360	2394720	So I've been pushing some of my classes there and just trying to do my daily dungeons to
2394720	2396080	get tomes and all that good stuff.
2396080	2397320	So there's that.
2397320	2400960	I've also been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, no real accomplishments to scream
2400960	2401960	about.
2401960	2404880	Oh, I had such a bad squad today.
2404880	2408280	I got that achievement for hooking three people in the basement.
2408320	2412560	I thought you had to do it all at the same time, but apparently no, because I hooked
2412560	2414920	a Mikaela who died down there.
2414920	2418240	I was playing Freddy and I was a mean Freddy too.
2418240	2421340	I was, you know, because I had a daily or something like that.
2421340	2426000	So I hooked somebody down there and then I hooked two others after that.
2426000	2429600	And I got, I wasn't trying to do a basement build, it was just very convenient.
2429600	2430600	And I got that achievement.
2430600	2432480	I was like, oh, I thought this would be a lot harder to get.
2432480	2433480	Who knew?
2433480	2435360	So you just have to hook three people in one game?
2435360	2436360	Yeah.
2436360	2437360	In the basement.
2437440	2438440	That's an achievement.
2438440	2439440	Do you know what it's called?
2439440	2442400	Something about like holiday gathering or something, because it talks about the holiday
2442400	2443400	tree or something.
2443400	2445320	Cause that's what it's, uh, yeah.
2445320	2451960	I think you might have to, uh, yeah, holiday, it might have to be sacrificing three people
2451960	2452960	in the basement specifically.
2452960	2453960	But I did do that.
2453960	2458240	In a public match have at least three survivors hooked in the basement at the same time.
2458240	2459800	Oh, happy holiday.
2459800	2462080	No, there's, uh, milk and cookies.
2462080	2466880	Um, no, the holiday get together means have three hooked in the basement at the same time.
2467400	2468400	And guess what?
2468400	2469400	It bugged for me.
2469400	2472800	Cause Michaela was D E D dead, uh, when I hooked the other two.
2472800	2475520	So that's, that's fascinating.
2475520	2478680	I hooked one of them.
2478680	2479680	Did they eat off the hook?
2479680	2481720	No, I went wild.
2481720	2482720	So I got an achievement.
2482720	2485920	I probably shouldn't have gotten bugs in my Debbie.
2485920	2490560	Uh, let's see, uh, what other games did I play this week?
2490560	2492720	I played just a little bit of no man's sky.
2492720	2496720	I'm waiting to see if they start up an expedition five or what I've been watching Alan play
2497560	2498560	a lot of it.
2498560	2501200	Uh, and, uh, we are going to do a multiplayer game hopefully real soon.
2501200	2502200	So that'll be fun.
2502200	2507400	Um, other than that location based games and the only other basement ones, there's Texas
2507400	2512680	barbecue where you hook 25 survivors in the basement once per survivor per match.
2512680	2513680	Huh?
2513680	2515640	Then holiday get together is the one that you just got.
2515640	2516640	Yeah.
2516640	2517640	That's the one.
2517640	2518640	Wow.
2518640	2519640	All right.
2519640	2526280	Um, you know, maybe it was bugging out in the way that, um, sometimes you run by a hook
2526840	2529520	and you still hear the noises of someone on it, even though they've long been sacrificed.
2529520	2530520	Yeah.
2530520	2534560	I bet it's doing that because I think I did have them on three different hooks.
2534560	2538560	I think that actually happens when someone is spectating.
2538560	2539560	Oh, maybe.
2539560	2540560	Maybe.
2540560	2541560	All right.
2541560	2542560	Anyway.
2542560	2543560	Very likely.
2543560	2544560	But, but anyway.
2544560	2545560	Yeah.
2545560	2546560	Yeah.
2546560	2547560	All right.
2547560	2548560	Uh, let's move on.
2548560	2549560	Get into some gaming news.
2549560	2552840	Um, Loki start us off while you still can.
2552840	2553840	Yeah.
2553880	2560880	So apparently, um, take two has purchased Zynga because take two is kind of a toxic
2560880	2566480	company and now they purchase part of Activision Blizzard or wait, what's that part of Activision
2566480	2567480	Blizzard?
2567480	2572640	No, you're thinking King, King Candy Crush mobile companies.
2572640	2576240	I confuse them in essentially the same, um, no anyways.
2576240	2581960	So yeah, they purchase Zynga now because you know, how else do we compete with, you know,
2581960	2585840	Activision Blizzard, but we'll have our own mobile company that, you know, they'll push
2585840	2586840	out some other stuff.
2586840	2590280	So they bought them for $12.7 billion.
2590280	2596320	And honestly, I could not tell you what they have, uh, worked on recently, but apparently
2596320	2601940	they're going to be maybe possibly bringing, you know, some of the take two franchises
2601940	2604240	to mobile platforms.
2604240	2608000	Looking forward to that mobile version of Bioshock.
2608000	2609800	How much did they pay for Zynga?
2609800	2614600	Because when I heard the amount, I was like, they're worth that much.
2614600	2615600	Like, sorry.
2615600	2616600	I'm not trying to be rude.
2616600	2617600	Prize.
2617600	2618600	Yeah.
2618600	2622000	Considering that like, but the Farmville days are long gone.
2622000	2623520	Those are long behind us.
2623520	2625120	Like what games is he?
2625120	2626120	Okay.
2626120	2629320	Does Zynga make one of those games where like, okay, there was the one that Mariah
2629320	2632680	Carey was in the commercial and now there's a new one.
2632680	2637560	Alan was showing me this commercial that Kathy Bates was in and it's, and I've, I've seen
2637560	2640260	this commercial without the celebrities.
2640260	2644560	It's something about like a grandma with a, uh, a mystery or something.
2644560	2647720	And she's like, like the whole commercial is like, grandma's being taken away in the
2647720	2652600	back of a cop car and she holds up a sign that says like, he's still alive and all this
2652600	2653600	stuff.
2653600	2657880	And then, and it's a fucking match three game and it's like, yeah, it's not that.
2657880	2662280	So they've put out like, um, some of their games that they put out recently, CSR racing
2662280	2665480	to Zynga poker, a bunch of slot machine games.
2665480	2670520	And then I guess they're also working on star Wars hunters, which is an arena combat game
2670520	2675720	that's coming out on mobile and switch.
2675720	2676720	I don't know.
2676720	2681440	I don't think they're worth $12 billion, but I don't need, I forgot the Zynga starting
2681440	2683300	to get into consoles though.
2683300	2684360	Merge mansion.
2684360	2685360	That's the name of it.
2685360	2687720	So I'm totally giving them a free prop.
2687720	2692120	I should make sure it's not a ABK product because we banned them from the show, but
2692120	2694880	I don't think it, Oh, meta core is the name of the company.
2694880	2700960	So it's not even Zynga, some new company, uh, that has apparently it has made $38 million
2700960	2705480	with some weird ass fucking commercials, the newest one having Kathy Bates on it.
2705480	2706480	So wild.
2706480	2707480	Yeah.
2707480	2708480	All right.
2708480	2713000	Uh, Bobby points out, Rob, there's a Zynga developer.
2713000	2714320	It was on your dragon con panel.
2714320	2715320	She's working on hunters.
2715320	2716880	I had no idea that was a Zynga product.
2716880	2718200	I really didn't.
2718200	2719720	Let's see.
2719720	2724140	And uh, black and Pat says Zynga has a strong partnership with Hasbro.
2724140	2728060	So boggle words with friends, all the damn farm bills.
2728060	2730580	So many words with friends.
2730580	2731580	Okay.
2731580	2737380	That's one that I know is still big, um, and still does very well, uh, even amongst the
2737380	2738900	wordle of the world.
2738900	2742900	Oh, I don't think that made the show tonight, but, um, you know, all those knockoff wordle
2742900	2747460	clones got like yanked from the Apple store and I think Google play as well.
2747460	2752060	Um, I thought that was very interesting is that, uh, those wordle clones, which is weird
2752060	2755580	because wordle isn't really an original concept.
2755580	2762460	Um, the, the game show lingo was that, um, you know, it's nice to have that without that
2762460	2767100	asshole Chuck Woolery hosting, but, uh, you know, wordles kind of a different thing.
2767100	2769460	Um, so it's interesting that that'll got pulled.
2769460	2772140	I wonder if they are going to do an official app or something along those lines.
2772140	2773140	I don't know.
2773140	2777220	But word games are always very popular, you know, dark soccer talked about, talks about
2777220	2778220	that one every other week.
2778220	2780180	Uh, yeah, I always play word scapes.
2780180	2781180	Yeah.
2781300	2783260	Even I played that for a little bit.
2783260	2785780	So word games are very popular on mobile.
2785780	2788500	So, um, black and Pat bringing up words with friends.
2788500	2790940	That's definitely an aha moment.
2790940	2793380	I think that one's definitely worth something.
2793380	2798460	Um, Questbuster says last year was a bit rough for Zynga, but the acquisition fills in a
2798460	2800420	mobile gap for take two.
2800420	2805620	If I re if I recall correctly, only 10% of take two's business is dedicated to mobile.
2805620	2806820	You're probably right.
2806820	2810500	It's just, it still seems like such a lot of amount of money.
2810820	2811820	Oh my gosh.
2812820	2813820	All right.
2814820	2817300	Ah, mobile games, mobile games.
2817300	2821100	Have any of those crazy ads worked on any of you for mobile games?
2821100	2822900	Cause one that I left ads.
2822900	2829940	Well, I see them in, uh, like Instagram, like I, um, I was on, I don't, I don't, oh, you're
2829940	2830940	so edgy.
2830940	2831940	Oh my God.
2831940	2832940	You don't ever see ads.
2832940	2833940	You're so edgy.
2833940	2837660	No, I mean, I don't use Instagram hardly at all anymore.
2837660	2838660	You don't see ads anywhere?
2838820	2841100	I have an ad blocker, so.
2841100	2842100	On your mobile phone?
2842100	2843100	Yeah.
2843100	2844100	Okay.
2844100	2846100	I have an ad blocker on my phone.
2846100	2847100	Okay.
2847100	2848100	Ooh, she's different.
2848100	2850100	Um, all right.
2850100	2855340	Look, uh, I see, I see ads on Instagram, I see ads on TikTok, I said, but one of the
2855340	2860420	ones I saw on Instagram was a game called, um, I'm not, which is fine.
2860420	2862140	They're not paying me so I don't have to get the name right.
2862140	2865540	It was something like cat Island or something and it was a bunch of cats and it looked like
2865540	2867340	an animal crossing game where they were on an Island.
2867340	2869140	I was like, sign me the fuck up.
2869140	2870980	So I played it and I was like, oh, kitties.
2870980	2873500	And then I realized this isn't very good.
2873500	2876780	So but I was just curious if those ads have ever worked on people.
2876780	2881920	Those of you that, you know, are the, the, the, um, uh, the peons of the internet who
2881920	2887380	still see ads, um, Mike Deaf says nope.
2887380	2892980	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says everyone jokes about the raid shadow legends ads that streamers
2892980	2893980	get.
2893980	2895860	They're the audibles for podcasts of the streaming world.
2895860	2897020	Oh yeah, I've heard of that.
2897700	2901140	Cause that's the one that'll like pay you to do a sponsored stream and you get so much
2901140	2903180	money for every person that signs up or something.
2903180	2904180	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2904180	2905180	I've heard of that.
2905180	2906180	All right.
2906180	2908180	I've still never played it though.
2908180	2912820	So my, my $3 or however much you get for, um, convincing someone to sign up is still
2912820	2913820	up for grabs.
2913820	2914820	I'll give you that.
2914820	2915820	All right.
2915820	2921300	Moving on for now though, let's talk about, uh, riot games and let's talk about a very
2921300	2925900	interesting change that they're making, uh, in their world is that they are going to allow
2925900	2931740	staff to leave with 25% of their salary, their yearly salary.
2931740	2937580	Uh, and uh, this is a, from a blog post where CEO Nicola Laurent, uh, talks about the plan
2937580	2942180	for the next five years in terms of the structure of the company and the content and the direction
2942180	2943180	they're going.
2943180	2946420	So I want to make clear when we talk about this, we're not talking about riot is laying
2946420	2950700	people off or I'm telling people they need to go somewhere else and doing a contract
2950700	2954740	buyout or, or just, well, there really is no contracts in California.
2954740	2958940	It's a, uh, um, right to work or whatever they call it, state, uh, at will.
2958940	2959940	That's it.
2959940	2960940	Uh, employment state.
2960940	2965540	Um, so, um, but my, but what I do think is interesting is that they're willing to basically
2965540	2970020	say, Hey, if you don't like the direction we're going in, here's the money for you to
2970020	2971020	leave.
2971020	2975740	Um, and it creates a very interesting temptation for people too, because you know, let's say
2975740	2979940	you make, I don't know, we'll say you make $80,000 a year.
2979940	2980940	I don't know.
2980940	2981940	Let's say 60.
2981940	2982940	We'll go, we'll drop it a little bit.
2982940	2983940	So the math's easier.
2983940	2984940	Uh, Oh no, it's 25.
2984940	2985940	Sorry.
2985940	2986940	I thought it was a third.
2986940	2987940	So 25%.
2987940	2989220	We'll say, we'll say 70,000 then.
2989220	2990220	Okay.
2990220	2996020	So seven, uh, divided by this is about 12, $12,500 or something like that.
2996020	3000820	If you're willing to walk out the door right away, um, no 17.
3000820	3001820	I can't math.
3001820	3004260	Why did I sign up for math tonight anyway?
3004260	3005960	A substantial amount of money.
3005960	3011260	So if you don't agree with the, uh, vision that the company has for the future, you can
3011260	3012260	walk away.
3012260	3017420	I know Riot's been under the microscope when we talk about a lot of this whole like harassment
3017420	3021460	and women getting treated shitty and all of this stuff, you know, Riot's been under the
3021460	3023100	microscope for that.
3023100	3029060	And I will say to the CEO's credit, uh, this bold new direction for Riot is going to have
3029060	3030060	none of that.
3030060	3032500	Uh, or, you know, obviously, you know what I mean?
3032500	3036820	The vision has none of that and hopefully they are able to, uh, make that a successful
3036820	3038780	in a implementation.
3038780	3043920	So basically if you don't, if you think that we're being politically correct, or if you
3043920	3049040	think this company is too woke, then you can walk.
3049040	3054740	So I, I, I do appreciate that element of it, that Riot's basically paying people to leave
3054740	3055740	if they don't like it.
3055740	3057740	Get the hell out of here.
3057740	3061220	Um, uh, this is a policy they've actually had in place for a while.
3061220	3065400	Um, but they're kind of upping it for the month of January to this 25%.
3065400	3072260	But I guess new people to the company, uh, can always take 10% of their annual to leave.
3072260	3075640	Like if they don't like it during onboarding orientation, that's a thing they have.
3075640	3078500	I think that's a very interesting thing for companies to put out there.
3078500	3079500	But you know what?
3079500	3082600	It might sound like a lot of money to pay somebody 10% of their salary, but you know
3082600	3087400	what the cost to like onboard somebody, train somebody, get them access to equipment and
3087400	3088400	all that stuff.
3088400	3090920	And the, the hours you're paying that, you know what, it adds up.
3090920	3095160	And so to pay them to walk away rather than invest that it makes you know that they really
3095160	3096400	want to be here.
3096400	3099280	So that's, uh, that's very interesting, I think.
3099280	3100680	So we'll see.
3100680	3104880	I'd be curious to see how many employees take it.
3104880	3106600	That's what I'll be interested to hear.
3106600	3107600	All right.
3107600	3112840	I'm very, uh, oh, uh, S2100 Matt with a comment over twitch.tv slash vog network says, treat
3112840	3115000	your employees well with respect.
3115000	3119320	You will get a better product and a happier employee that goes for any industry.
3119320	3121680	It just benefits everyone to treat everyone well.
3121680	3122680	Yeah.
3122680	3126960	I mean, I'm not my day job here very much, but if they offered me 25% to leave, I wouldn't,
3126960	3127960	I wouldn't take it.
3127960	3133040	I'd rather stay there for several more years, um, because I'm, I'm happy with it and happy
3133040	3135480	with the direction they're going and, and all that stuff.
3135480	3137680	So like this buyout thing wouldn't work with me.
3137680	3141200	Um, but I, I bet that's not true of a lot of people out there who, if their company
3141200	3143320	offered something like this, they probably would take it.
3143320	3146160	Um, and I get it, I get it.
3146160	3147160	All right.
3147160	3148160	Uh, moving on dark Sakura.
3148640	3153840	Um, I think this is very interesting, this, uh, very mainstream press article you've got
3153840	3154840	for us.
3154840	3162440	I, the only reason that I am going back into NFTs talking about it is because New York
3162440	3166640	times covered it about how pissed we are.
3166640	3171000	After our disastrous show last week, I thought I would say the one thing I'm happy about
3171000	3173420	our show getting cut short by the internet.
3173420	3176040	We didn't get around to the NFT stories.
3176040	3180080	Darn the Lord works in mysterious ways.
3180080	3181080	All right.
3181080	3184440	But, but yes, the New York times talking about it is, is very newsworthy.
3184440	3185440	Yeah.
3185440	3191480	And there is a, actually, you know, basically these different companies are coming out with,
3191480	3197640	with NFTs and related content, trying to push it for games that people are really looking
3197640	3200720	forward to playing or are already playing.
3200720	3208120	And then the moment that it hits the internet, the, sorry, hiccup, um, the players are rebelling
3208120	3210000	against it immediately.
3210000	3214600	You know, they're like, no, we know what you're trying to do and we don't like it.
3214600	3224560	Um, there is, uh, uh, a person named Mutahar Anas who is a, uh, uh, has a pretty big YouTube.
3224560	3228640	Um, and I'm just going to read the quote exactly because that's how I feel about it.
3228760	3234800	Uh, people are being sold buzzwords, uh, th those pushing NFTs and games are trying to
3234800	3236720	sell you snake oil.
3236720	3247560	Um, and really this is going back into, uh, a lot having to do with, uh, just how people
3247560	3249840	are a lot more savvy these days.
3249840	3255000	You know, we were gamers in general are older.
3255320	3263880	We've been through seeing off, um, we've seen some shit, we've seen some shit, we've seen
3263880	3270240	loot crates and, and buying, uh, outfits for characters.
3270240	3273960	And I mean, shoot, Final Fantasy 14 is pretty terrible about it.
3273960	3277480	I think we lived in an era of the engage people.
3278440	3286360	Yeah, the, but this is now taking all of the, you know, buying stuff with in-game currency
3286360	3290840	and just pushing it up a whole other, other notch.
3290840	3297960	A lot of players are really seeing that these companies are trying to nickel and dime and
3297960	3303160	suck the, their user base for every penny that they could possibly get out of them.
3303160	3304520	And they've had enough.
3305160	3313960	And it's, um, it's absolutely just, just disgusting.
3313960	3315720	A lot of people are disgusted by it.
3315720	3324200	Um, there, um, there's people who are saying, you know, well, if they've got this thing
3324200	3327080	that's not available in the game, but I have to pay to get it.
3327080	3329000	Why isn't it just available in the game?
3329000	3330920	Anyway, I've bought this game.
3330920	3335160	Why are you making me pay for more things that's already technically in the game?
3336120	3342680	Um, and I mean, there has been some major blowback.
3342680	3353160	Um, for example, uh, uh, Sega, um, got a lot of negative, uh, press after they, you know,
3353160	3358040	had made public, uh, information about their plans to use NFT and crypto.
3358040	3363480	Um, Ubisoft, um, we, we covered them at the end of the year.
3363480	3369240	They also were really surprised at how unhappy their customers were.
3370120	3378920	Um, yeah, there's a, in fact, the, there's a, a couple of, uh, YouTube videos out there
3378920	3384040	talking about, uh, where, where they had made the announcement that got like 90% dislikes
3384040	3385160	from the people that viewed it.
3385960	3388600	Um, they're, uh,
3391720	3399960	they're really, um, some people are thinking that their NFTs, well, the companies are saying
3399960	3402680	that their NFTs are not motivated by profit.
3402680	3407880	For example, uh, Matt Wolf at Zynga, his quote is that it's all about community.
3407880	3414840	We believe in giving people the opportunity to play to earn, but no.
3415720	3424120	The, the thing is about it is that, is that the whole thing is we're, we're not stupid.
3424840	3425560	We're not stupid.
3426120	3427880	A lot of people are stupid, but we're not.
3427880	3429560	I'm, I'm very curious.
3429560	3432680	I need to crowdsource or chat source this a bit.
3432680	3436200	Is there, because I would be, I would be honestly curious of the perspective.
3437000	3443160	Are there any like gaming podcasts or YouTube channels you all listen to that are pro NFT?
3443160	3444280	And like, what's the angle.
3444280	3450920	And I, I mean, things that existed before this that have decided they are pro NFT.
3450920	3457240	I don't mean a show that started from some crypto folks who are now doing, getting into gaming.
3457240	3458680	Cause then I don't want that.
3458680	3464200	I want somebody who existed before that is pro and continuing with that.
3464200	3466760	I would, I would be like, where are they?
3466760	3468600	Cause I would like to hear that perspective.
3469080	3474360	Well, I don't know from any on our level, but there are a couple of companies that are
3474360	3481800	against NFTs, uh, valve for one thing, uh, uh, for steam, it prohibits, uh, blockchain
3481800	3484600	games that allow cryptocurrencies or entities.
3484600	3485080	Thank God.
3485080	3489240	Cause how easy would it be to convert that, um, trading card system they have to something
3489240	3490120	powered by NFT?
3490120	3492440	And maybe that's why they get it.
3492440	3498520	What's silly though, is like what these companies are trying to do is basically they're trying
3498520	3502280	to do basically what valve is doing already with some of these trading cards and other
3502280	3503080	things.
3503080	3507640	It's, it's purchases where people can sell and trade stuff that they have.
3507640	3511240	It doesn't need blockchain though, to track all that.
3511240	3512920	They have a system that just does it.
3512920	3513640	It's fine.
3513640	3518200	And, and they make person, they make a cut off of every trade, which is kind of what
3518200	3519160	the companies want.
3519160	3523640	So like, I don't understand why we got to go this NFT route for all this stuff.
3523640	3528040	Because it, the difference with an NFT is that there, you know, a lot of people are
3528040	3532280	saying that these are going to be items that are transferable between games or that you
3532280	3538120	can use this token for your NFT in other franchises by the same companies.
3538120	3540600	That's sort of where you're taking out of it.
3540600	3541320	That's the point.
3541320	3543400	Never, never do that.
3545240	3550760	Can you imagine if like FIFA, if, if EA decided that FIFA ultimate team stuff, that the players
3550760	3554760	would be transferable between different players, do that.
3555560	3560680	Outfits, items, you know, you would have something from one game that would affect the gameplay
3560680	3565000	in another, you know, that's, it'll never happen.
3565000	3566360	They'll never implement it that way.
3566360	3567720	But, but Jamie's right.
3567720	3568440	But Jamie's right.
3568440	3569720	That's what they think is going to happen.
3569720	3572840	Cause that was that whole talk around pinhead and dead by daylight and all that, which,
3572840	3575720	which by the way, suddenly disappeared that chat.
3576600	3577960	There's more about that by the way.
3578360	3583720	On Thursday, I believe it's going to be five o'clock Pacific time.
3584280	3590840	There is going to be, I have to find the channel again, but Doug Bradley and, and his wife,
3590840	3595000	Steph are going to be talking about the recording session for dead by daylight.
3596280	3601480	I caught last week's live show and this one looks to be fascinating.
3601480	3602920	They usually keep their repeats up.
3602920	3605400	They also did one with Robert England, but that one's gone, I think.
3605400	3612440	But also Doug Bradley is just absolutely fascinating to hear talk outside of his pinhead voice.
3613720	3621160	But, but back to, back to this, Tim Sweeney, the chief executive of Epic games said, and
3621160	3626680	this is actually the tweet, we aren't touching NFTs as the whole field is currently tangled
3626680	3633320	up with an intractable mix of scams, interesting decentralized tech foundations and scams.
3634200	3640600	Um, although they're still allowing, um, third party developers on their store to allow blockchain.
3643240	3651080	So I, this is, this is what my thought is going to happen.
3651080	3652760	There's, they're going to keep trying.
3653960	3657560	They're not admitting defeat yet.
3657560	3663640	And I think that they're going to have, well, it's like what I said, right at the beginning
3663640	3666040	of the show, they're going to have to be deceptive about it.
3666920	3667880	Does that make sense?
3667880	3668600	Yes.
3668600	3680520	And they're going to have to put this out in a term that is going to appeal and separate
3681320	3689000	and separate the concept, or at least the buzzword of NFT from the concept of NFT.
3690760	3693560	Um, and I, I just have to call out, have I gone robot?
3693560	3695880	Because the thing is we're losing frames.
3695880	3696520	Nope.
3696520	3697000	Okay.
3697000	3700360	Well, you still find in me, let's try to push through.
3700360	3706360	We're at an, now you are, I was, this is exactly the point that this started last week
3707160	3709480	was right an hour into the show.
3711480	3713480	Oh, like clockwork.
3713480	3716200	Big NFT doesn't want us talking about it.
3716200	3718200	So you're doing everything to shut down the system.
3719160	3719880	Seriously.
3721160	3721800	All right.
3721800	3724840	Just try to keep powering through for the sake of the podcast listeners.
3724840	3727240	I'm going to pray it sorts itself out in the next few minutes.
3727880	3729320	It's not too bad right now to me.
3729320	3730600	So yeah, it's fine.
3730600	3731100	Okay.
3731800	3733800	Uh, Loki, why don't you go ahead with your follow-up then?
3734440	3740440	Oh, speaking of NFTs, uh, Konami who, yeah, I guess they're making games still.
3740440	3747400	Uh, they decided that, you know, with their NFT 35th anniversary memorial of the Castlevania
3747400	3752760	series, they went ahead and sold out of those NFTs and made the total of $162,000.
3755800	3759160	And this is why these companies are going to keep getting into it because they can
3759160	3762360	literally produce something that takes no effort whatsoever.
3762440	3763960	It is just an image.
3763960	3771400	And then they can make $162,000 that's effort for profit is just, it's insane.
3771960	3777880	Um, so yeah, they sold the highest selling item, I think was actually for 26,000, which
3777880	3780360	was a digital map of Dracula's castle.
3781320	3785080	Um, it's just, that's just nuts.
3785080	3787240	So yeah, it's here to stay.
3787240	3795560	And one also, uh, another person that's gained of teases, none other than voice actor,
3795560	3802920	Troy Baker, who was partnering with voice verse NFTs to have an NFT, I guess of him
3804280	3805720	or his voice.
3805720	3809320	I'm not really sure what it is, but nobody likes it.
3810840	3814360	I like, I like Troy Baker saying he's my favorite voice in saints row, but like,
3814360	3822840	Yeah, I don't know what exactly it is that he's trying to get on, except somebody probably
3822840	3825320	sat him down and told him how he could make more money.
3825320	3830120	And, um, you know, I guess, I guess Twitter is sure opening up his eyes real quick though,
3830120	3831960	as to why that's a bad idea.
3831960	3839320	Um, but I, I'm just so disappointed that Konami got rewarded for the whole like Castlevania
3839320	3842440	NFTs and that whole thing, because we didn't get around to being able to talk about it
3842440	3845480	last week because the internet issues, which by the way, I've got a green light now.
3845480	3846760	So maybe it was just a hiccup.
3846760	3848760	Let's all hold hands and pray.
3848760	3852680	Uh, but I think, I think chat, the live folks of the podcast won't notice anything, but
3852680	3856280	the live folks have been able to hear us, but they haven't been able to see us.
3856280	3861000	So that does tell me my upload just got borked enough where the audio is getting through,
3861000	3863160	but the video is not, but now it should be everything.
3863160	3864600	So it's just crazy.
3864600	3867080	Anyway, let's all hold hands and pray.
3867080	3871560	Um, but meanwhile, the Castlevania thing, like I just, it blows my mind how like you
3871560	3877480	can say that somebody owns a song as legendary as bloody tears.
3877480	3878760	Not in this fucking house.
3878760	3881480	You don't, that song belongs to the people.
3881480	3882600	That song is art.
3882600	3885080	That song should belong to the composer.
3885640	3887000	You don't own that song.
3887000	3888520	I don't care how much you pay for it.
3890120	3896840	I don't recognize that in this house, Rob, as a person who has done a lot of graphic
3896840	3904760	design, when you are contracted to do any kind of work, be it musical, anything like
3904760	3910760	that for a company, it is automatically a part of your contract that the company owns
3910760	3911880	your final work.
3911880	3912680	Yeah, I get it.
3912680	3917080	And that's how like, like BeatMania 2DX is still able to use Naoki songs, even though
3917080	3918520	he left the company a long time ago.
3918520	3922040	Like, yeah, I, I get it from that standpoint and the whole thing.
3922040	3926680	And, and obviously when it comes to those sorts of situations and, and being able to
3926680	3932280	re-release the games with the music intact and all of that, then yes, great that the
3932280	3933000	company owns it.
3933000	3938760	But I, like Joe Crypto Bro should keep their hands off that fucking song.
3939400	3946520	Like, I, I don't, I think the best analogy to NFTs that I saw was the whole, like, you
3946520	3950840	know, those services where you register a star in the galaxy with your name on it and
3950840	3954040	it's in this database, but it's not NASA's database.
3954040	3955560	So it doesn't really fucking matter.
3955560	3958760	And that is not the actual scientific name of the star.
3958760	3962840	That's how I feel about all this stuff is that y'all are buying into this database.
3962840	3968360	And it's just like, okay, Bitcoin was the first crypto coin, but suddenly the first
3968360	3970120	major somebody's going to correct me on it.
3970120	3973000	If I don't clarify it first major breakthrough crypto coin.
3974760	3978680	There's going to be other forms of NFT and this whole stuff.
3978680	3986600	And it's, it's, it's, it's going to literally fall up its own black hole asshole into this
3986600	3993400	void of non-existence because the seas will be polluted with all of these people trying
3993400	3998120	to get in on, on cashing out on receipts and naming rights, which is basically that whole
3998120	3998520	thing.
3998520	4002360	Or better yet when people decide it's not worth anything and then it just devalues itself
4002360	4003000	to nothing.
4003000	4003240	Yeah.
4004120	4007640	It's like Mike Deft brings up this week and fuck Konami.
4007640	4008600	You know, what's funny.
4008600	4014680	I was sent the latest, uh, Jim Stephanie Sterling video on, uh, the fuck Konami and the NFT
4014680	4017320	stuff and, and what they had to say about the whole thing.
4017320	4020120	I was actually a little disappointed.
4020120	4024040	I thought the video would have a little more bite than it actually did.
4024040	4028760	And that's no disrespect to, uh, Stephanie, who I think, I think they have some great
4028760	4034120	takes, but, um, I think it's just, they, they've beaten that horse dead, like so much.
4034120	4037320	That's why it's like, you know, what, what more is there really to say?
4037320	4041240	It's kind of like at this point, they're kind of getting worn down by just the industry
4041240	4041720	and everything.
4041720	4044680	And so I am a big fan of them.
4044680	4050200	Um, it's just, it's just like, yeah, it's like, well, it's not too shocking because
4050200	4050840	it's Konami.
4050840	4053000	So that, and that's okay.
4053000	4056600	Stephanie it's, it's, it's like the last episode of our show.
4056600	4058680	We tried, it didn't quite work.
4058680	4059400	Okay.
4059400	4060680	It's going to happen sometimes.
4060680	4061560	It's okay.
4061560	4063160	Uh, I'm, I'm still a fan.
4063160	4067160	Uh, that's, yeah, but it definitely felt like one of those videos where it was like,
4067160	4070680	they're only doing this because they feel like they have to, or the fan base is going
4070680	4072120	to complain, you know?
4073960	4076280	But anyway, all right.
4076280	4077960	Uh, let's move on.
4078600	4080280	I don't want to talk about NFTs anymore.
4080280	4081560	I got no fucking time for those.
4082520	4086680	Let's talk about, let's talk about something for some reason you still can't buy, which
4086680	4088680	is Final Fantasy 14.
4088680	4094360	Uh, because Final Fantasy 14 has been continuing to have server issues, but a roadmap was posted
4094360	4098600	this week that will include resales of the game going back on sale.
4098600	4103240	So Final Fantasy 14, if you are not on board with the game yet, uh, and you've wanted to
4103240	4106520	get in on it because of all the Endwalker hype, because the servers have been having
4106520	4111080	so many issues, you can't, you can't do it right now, but as of January 25th, you will
4111080	4112600	be able to buy the game again.
4112600	4116840	Have you ever heard of a game company pulling a game off a shelf for a month only to put
4116840	4119240	it back because the game is too popular?
4119240	4123080	This is like I said, 2021 crazy year for games.
4123080	4129240	Um, so, uh, but now Kiyoshita did point out, or did put out a list of where, so what's
4129240	4134040	going to change on January 25th, according to this roadmap, the Oceana data server is
4134040	4135080	going to open.
4135080	4140120	So, um, Australia, New Zealand, and you know, some of the Pacific rim, that whole part of
4140120	4142200	the world is going to get their own servers.
4142200	4146360	So that's going to be people that come off of where those people are playing now, which
4146360	4149480	is mostly the Japanese servers for a good chunk of that.
4149480	4153160	And some of the North American servers, even, because a lot of the Australians want to play
4153160	4155320	there, um, or Europe even.
4155320	4159800	So it's going to involve a lot of those folks coming off of other data centers to play on
4159800	4160840	a dedicated data center.
4160840	4166840	So they think that's going to be enough, um, to, uh, resale, resell the game again.
4166840	4169960	The queue situation is also just talking firsthand.
4169960	4171880	It's improved a little bit.
4171880	4176680	It's still not great in prime time, but I can pretty reliably get on the game in my
4176680	4180680	usual hours of like eight or nine o'clock at night and not face a huge queue.
4180680	4183960	I think what's happened is that now the end Walker's been out for a month.
4183960	4187240	The people that wanted to play through the main scenario have done it.
4187240	4192680	Um, and fantasy 14 has declared the end of spoiler warnings for end Walker.
4192680	4195880	So I guess we can openly talk about spoilers for the game now in their eyes.
4195880	4197080	I'm not going to do it.
4197080	4200520	We did a spoiler cast that's in the VoG network archives here on Twitch.
4200520	4201640	If you want to go check it out.
4201640	4203560	So I already have that all out of my system.
4203560	4206680	So for those of you, cause I think even Jamie said she still wanted to play through it at
4206680	4209640	some point, I will not spoil y'all have your chance.
4209640	4215240	But, um, I think square has basically, you know, taken that approach of, well, all the
4215240	4218040	people that really wanted to play it are through the game now.
4218040	4223000	So, uh, we can probably open it up a little more than, um, they are going to be adding
4223000	4227960	more worlds to the North American server and Europe throughout the rest of 2022 and into
4227960	4229080	2023.
4229080	4230760	The roadmap is really long.
4230760	4235160	I got to say, it doesn't look like they're really able to address the issues with North
4235160	4238600	America, which, you know, yes, I'm going to be selfish and only care about that for now
4239160	4241400	until August of 2022.
4241400	4244040	Four new worlds will go online in August.
4245000	4252360	That's I mean, I get that there are semiconductor shortages and all that, but damn pull the
4252360	4255960	servers for 11 and use them to run for it.
4255960	4256840	I'm just kidding.
4256840	4257880	Bob has 11 fans.
4257880	4258360	Don't hate me.
4258360	4259080	Don't hate me.
4259080	4260600	But everyone's playing on pirate servers.
4264440	4265480	It's never going to happen.
4267320	4271000	Ziba in chat says the cues on the crystal data center have been double digits.
4271000	4278920	I will run into the thousand person long queue still on Cactuar because again, I was there
4278920	4285000	first, but I happened to roll on the server where the very, very, very popular World of
4285000	4289560	Warcraft streamer who decided to take up Final Fantasy 14 and rather enjoyed it and
4289560	4291640	doesn't talk very favorably of wow anymore.
4292200	4294600	And I happen to be on that person's server.
4294600	4295480	I was there first.
4295480	4296440	Thank you very much.
4296440	4298680	And again, I don't want to gatekeep the game.
4298680	4300520	I'm thrilled that person is there.
4300520	4302120	I'm thrilled the community is there.
4302760	4308040	I'm hoping that what we're supposed to get before August and that whole cross data center
4308040	4314920	thing is going to really help ease a lot of that because I know I am more than happy
4314920	4318840	to go log into crystal and go play with Ziba for the night.
4318840	4322200	So I don't have to worry about the cues on Aether.
4322200	4325160	And I think that will kind of work itself out at the end of the day.
4326200	4329560	So I'm really, really hoping for the data center travel really soon.
4329560	4336840	It's supposed to still come with, well, they're now saying not 6.1, but the 6.1X series.
4336840	4341400	So it's going to be a few months still, but hopefully not too far out.
4342200	4343320	All right, let's move on.
4344200	4345080	Dark Sakura.
4345080	4347720	I think this is an interesting trend in the workplace.
4348600	4357240	Yeah, there are some video game studios who are taking to heart this thing that's been
4357240	4360920	tried in Japan for several different companies.
4360920	4364040	And that's moving people to a four-day work week.
4364840	4370840	I am going to go and say this, that they're not talking about a four-day work week like
4370840	4372840	I have because I work four by 10.
4373480	4375960	These are for eight-hour days.
4378040	4382520	And in fact, one of the companies, Crows, Crows, Crows,
4384120	4387160	they actually, they're the group that did the Stanley Parable.
4388920	4394360	They have rewritten contracts to do the same pay for four days of work instead of five.
4395080	4397960	And so far, so good.
4398680	4407720	Eidos Montreal is actually pushing back against the crunch time hours and everything by trying
4407720	4417000	to also limit time and making sure that people are able to treat themselves with compassion.
4417000	4422680	That's the quote coming back from Pew from Crows, Crows, Crows.
4423240	4432120	But there has been lots of studies coming on that shows this is actually scientific
4432120	4432920	research.
4432920	4439560	In Iceland, there was a trial run by the Reykjavik City Council that included over 2,500 workers,
4439560	4441160	which is 1% of the population.
4442120	4449240	They're saying that the workers felt less stress and at work of burnout because their
4449240	4453080	work-life balance improved after adopting a shorter working week.
4453960	4457560	They have more time to spend with their families, do hobbies and complete their household chores.
4459400	4466600	And their productivity remained the same, even though they had gone down from 40 hours
4466600	4467880	to 35 or 36.
4473240	4477080	The whole thing behind it is that they're saying that it's how the projects are being
4477080	4483400	managed, that if a project is being managed well, then they should be able to get the
4483400	4498360	same amount of work done in less time and that a more rested worker, a more, what's
4498360	4505240	the word I'm thinking of, a more fulfilled worker will work, will be happier and work
4505240	4508440	better because they're not running on empty.
4508440	4513480	And I actually find it funny that they were using an example from Japan about this because
4513480	4518120	over there, it's considered to be a mark of honor if you fall asleep at your job.
4521880	4527800	But they're really wanting work to be more dignified.
4528760	4538120	They want it to be something that's going to be where they're working ethically, which
4538120	4543560	is harder for some of the bigger studios, which is why Eidos Montreal and Eidos Sherbrooke
4544760	4550840	are considered the biggest leaps in the industry as for taking this role because they are larger
4550920	4551400	studios.
4552280	4560680	Both of them have done Final Fantasy games, Tomb Raider, because they worked under Square
4560680	4561640	Enix for a bit.
4563160	4568040	And of course, they did Guardians of the Galaxy, which is one of the best games of last year.
4568040	4570440	Yeah, I was just going to say Quest Buster just pointed that out in chat and I went,
4570440	4576440	oh yeah, speaking of 2021 games, that was way better than people thought it would be.
4576440	4587480	Yeah, and they're really, I mean, in the end, a lot of these companies are really trying
4587480	4592120	to just be better to their employees and they're getting better results.
4592840	4599720	And on top of that, one of the former producers at Crows Crows Crows, Alicia, I'm going to
4599720	4609080	mispronounce her name, contestable, I guess, was implementing the four day work week at
4609080	4611320	the studio that she's setting up.
4611960	4617800	And she's basically saying that because they're implementing that into their work structure,
4617800	4619640	they're not losing any time at all.
4622200	4625240	She thinks that her employees are going to be more resilient and well rested.
4625240	4628920	And on top of that, they're also aiming for healthier work culture.
4629560	4636760	And the quote is that it's one that's fundamentally anti-racist, feminist and LGBTQ plus friendly.
4636760	4639240	I'm going to add the A because don't forget the A ever.
4641720	4647880	And that according to a UK report, moving to a four day workweek can shrink carbon emissions,
4647880	4652280	reduces the energy used in a workplace and slash transport emissions for morning and evenings.
4653080	4659400	And then giving an extra day off means that people take part in more low carbon activities,
4659400	4662680	including resting, exercising and seeing their family.
4663880	4666040	So we'll see.
4667560	4673720	Right now, I mean, the big thing we have going on is the series of of walkouts and strikes and
4674440	4678840	companies that have, you know, notoriously mistreating their employees, especially
4679640	4683800	their non cisgender white male employees.
4687160	4691720	I think the work from home situation has also been very interesting, too, because it shows
4691720	4693800	most companies are able to do it.
4693800	4697880	I get with game design, it can be a little tricky because, you know, the collaboration
4697880	4699880	and some of that is a little tricky.
4699880	4704040	And that's why some games have had, you know, it's like Nintendo, like a lot of their stuff
4704040	4708040	has been delayed is because, you know, that that transition to work from home has been
4708040	4709480	difficult for a lot of people.
4709480	4713400	But for those where it works and it has worked for many companies and many individuals within
4713400	4717960	those companies, I think that's very interesting, like that long term effect it's going to have.
4717960	4718760	And it's also interesting.
4718760	4723560	It's having this conversation about what about four day work, which I just realized in the
4724120	4726440	scroll bar, I have four hour work weeks.
4726440	4730280	I meant to put four day work weeks for that, too.
4730280	4731880	But yeah, four day work week.
4731880	4738040	And I need to specify that it doesn't sound like they're wanting people to do four tens.
4738920	4746760	It sounds like they are working a regular eight hour day, just four days a week.
4747400	4753560	Now, for me, I'm going to go ahead and this is going to go into a little bit of personal
4753560	4754920	information on me.
4754920	4756440	I do four tens.
4756440	4757240	I do.
4757240	4760360	I do a four day, 10 hour work week.
4761880	4765160	Well, 40 hours, but 10 hours each day.
4765160	4771800	Now, I also have FMLA, intermittent FMLA, which lets me take off a certain number of
4772680	4773800	hours each month.
4773800	4775720	I get 40 hours a month off.
4776680	4786360	And I have noticed that I working an eight hour day, four days a week, because I was
4786360	4788760	running that before I did my narcolepsy test.
4789640	4793320	I actually felt generally better.
4793320	4799240	I felt like I could face my work day, that I wasn't super burnt by the, excuse me, by
4799240	4800120	the end of my day.
4802040	4811240	So and now I read a few years ago that they were saying that for like people over 35,
4812200	4821000	that it's better health wise to work like three to four days a week as opposed to a
4821000	4822200	full five day week.
4823240	4825000	I only glanced at the study.
4826120	4831000	But thankfully right now, my work is still having us stay at home.
4832280	4838760	And they're talking about moving to a hybrid schedule, which I plan on taking advantage
4838840	4850280	of that would be three days in the office and one day not, depending on the day of the
4850280	4853080	week, because they want people there on certain days of the week.
4855400	4859720	And I honestly think that we should stay at home.
4859720	4863480	I think that everybody, if you can work from home, you should stay at home.
4863480	4868280	If you're in an environment that you feel that you'd be better around people, yes,
4868280	4869000	have the option.
4869800	4879800	But the thing is that pushing people to be as productive with less presence, if that
4879800	4882520	makes sense, is better.
4883960	4890280	Give people the time.
4890280	4890600	Okay.
4891400	4893880	And also, I'll just type it in.
4893880	4894200	Okay.
4894200	4898280	As Joe and Matt in our chat says, this kind of goes back to what I said about a happy
4898280	4899080	employee.
4899080	4901320	I think a lot of companies, oh, it just scrolled off.
4901320	4905080	I think a lot of companies are doing a lot of experimenting right now with helping employees
4905080	4908200	mentally by giving folks a proper work-life balance.
4908200	4908840	I think it's great.
4908840	4911640	And we need to find a way to give employees that work-life balance.
4911640	4911880	Yeah.
4911880	4920120	A lot of companies really kind of having to evaluate what that means in this day and age,
4920120	4920520	for sure.
4921400	4921720	All right.
4922600	4925800	Um, before we lose Loki, let's try to get some more stories out of him.
4925800	4926680	Loki, what's next?
4927400	4928040	Oh, it's fine.
4928040	4929560	I'll just connect to my phone when I'm done.
4930200	4930840	Now we're here.
4930840	4931320	Sure.
4931320	4933480	So I'll be here the whole show.
4933480	4934200	All right.
4934200	4935080	That's the attitude.
4935080	4935580	Yeah.
4936040	4936840	Yeah.
4936840	4943400	So, uh, Oprah or the Lego group is actually delaying some of the new Overwatch 2 sets
4943400	4948840	because, well, Overwatch 2 isn't out and other reasons as well.
4949240	4956120	So they were originally going to launch in February on the first, but now it's being
4956120	4959400	pushed back to next year because of the delay of the game.
4960600	4965800	Also, they're also considering they're reviewing their partnership with Activision Blizzard,
4965800	4971480	given the concerns about progress being made to address continuing allegations regarding
4971480	4976440	workplace culture, especially the treatment of female colleagues and creating a diverse
4976440	4977640	and inclusive environment.
4978840	4980280	So yeah, there's that too.
4981160	4986040	Um, I didn't know they were going to put out new, I didn't know.
4986680	4989800	I didn't know they were putting out, I didn't know they were putting out
4989800	4993000	Overwatch 2 stuff either when the game's nowhere near done.
4993000	4995480	So that's kind of fascinating, but you know what?
4995480	5000840	Props to Lego for doing something extremely actionable about the whole situation.
5000840	5006040	And really, you know, especially with Bobby Kotick still in charge, um, who's, you know,
5006040	5009160	ultimately responsible for the work culture that he's created.
5009160	5014600	Um, I, I think that, uh, this is great that Lego is, well, I mean, the situation fucking
5014600	5019320	sucks, but what Legos action is really meaningful in this situation.
5019320	5023960	And, um, uh, yay, Lego for doing something.
5024760	5025640	Yeah, definitely.
5025640	5029720	I mean, um, I didn't know it was coming out.
5029720	5031480	Maybe the green purposes is something else.
5031480	5032680	It's a pretty cool set.
5032680	5033180	Yeah.
5033800	5034300	All right.
5034780	5035280	Okay.
5035580	5039420	Let's talk about this because a lot of you have been sharing this one on social media
5039420	5044220	this week, and I do see the humor in it, but, uh, we had some police officers that were
5044220	5045980	fired and why were they fired?
5045980	5049580	Uh, because they were playing Pokemon Go on the job.
5049580	5052380	But when I say they were playing Pokemon Go on the job, I mean, they were like really
5052380	5053900	playing it on the job.
5053900	5059180	Um, there was a report this week that two LAPD officers were patrolling a mall in the
5059180	5063900	Los Angeles area back in 2017, because our legal system is extremely slow.
5064540	5068220	And of course, Pokemon Go was still every, I mean, a lot of people still play Pokemon
5068220	5068860	Go today.
5068860	5072380	Uh, but even back in 2017, there were still many, many people playing it.
5072380	5077660	Um, and, uh, the control, you know, the people that talk about, Hey, go here.
5077660	5079500	Cause there's a call or there's an incident.
5079500	5083420	Uh, there was a, they were asked to respond to a robbery in progress.
5083980	5091020	However, the officers instead went to go get a Snorlax at a nearby Pokemon gym, which I
5091020	5093180	have no idea where that was maybe at the mall or something.
5093580	5099260	Uh, apparently the whole thing was recorded because every patrol car has a D I V C S.
5099260	5101420	I don't know what that is, but it's a monitoring system.
5101420	5104940	So like they know where the cars are at all times.
5104940	5106460	And so like a GPS thing.
5106460	5106700	Yeah.
5107340	5113820	Um, in the court documents, it said officer Mitchell alerted Lozano that Snorlax just
5113820	5118940	popped up at 46th and Limer after noting that Limer doesn't go all the way to 46.
5118940	5120060	Lozano responded.
5120060	5121340	Oh, you know what I can do?
5121340	5123900	I'll go down 11th and swing up on Crenshaw.
5123900	5125660	I know that way I can get to it.
5125660	5131020	Mitchell suggested a different route and then told Lozano, we've got four minutes after
5131020	5133420	Mitchell apparently caught the Snorlax.
5133420	5135660	Oh, well, I'm glad this story had a happy ending.
5137180	5141820	After Mitchell apparently caught the Snorlax exclaiming, got him.
5141820	5148060	Petitioners agreed to go get the Togetic and drove off when their car stopped.
5148060	5151340	Again, the monitoring system recorded Mitchell saying, don't run away.
5151340	5152220	Don't run away.
5152220	5155260	While Lozano described how he buried it and ultra bald.
5155820	5158140	Oh, they put in the court report.
5158140	5161980	B-U-R-I-E-D buried it like in the ground.
5162940	5166460	I think what he meant to say was buried it like a raspberry.
5166460	5168220	Uh, because that makes more sense.
5168860	5172300	That's really funny that the court documents butchered that English.
5172300	5173180	It's a fun language.
5174380	5176540	It's probably just transcribed, you know?
5176860	5178060	It is funny.
5178700	5183420	Lozano described how he buried it and ultra bald the Togetic before announcing got him.
5183420	5185580	Eventually, Mitchell explained, holy crap.
5185580	5189180	Finally, apparently in reference to catching the Togetic.
5189180	5192300	And he remarked, the guys are going to be so jealous.
5194220	5199420	The Board of Rights had their own unique perspective on this, saying playing Pokemon Go
5199420	5204620	showed complete disregard for the community, wasted resources, violated public trust,
5204620	5207100	and was unprofessional and embarrassing to the department.
5209420	5212060	They've done a lot of other stuff that's more embarrassing than that.
5212060	5212620	I know, right?
5212620	5214060	Should be embarrassed about.
5214060	5219340	Behavior reflected gross negligence, cowardice, lack of thoughtfulness, and deceit.
5219340	5220140	I know.
5220140	5222940	And certainly there have been a lot of takes this week about,
5222940	5226380	oh, Pokemon goes the thing they're going to get in trouble for.
5227740	5228700	I get it.
5228700	5229260	I get it.
5230060	5233020	But a lot of people have been sharing that story this week.
5233980	5237820	I can't imagine why, but it is interesting.
5239180	5240220	I will say this.
5241820	5246460	The times I've been pulled over by the police, which only actually happened once playing
5246460	5251820	Ingress, I was so easy, easily able to explain the game because I was like, okay, so, you
5251820	5254220	know, Pokemon Go, it's like that.
5254220	5256140	And now they all know what it is.
5256140	5260780	I didn't really cross my mind that the police are all playing Pokemon Go, but I guess I
5260780	5261660	guess that's that.
5262300	5266380	S2100, Matt says, we're going to need you to get out of here.
5267340	5270540	Snorlax wasn't a big deal and go even in 2017.
5270540	5271420	It kind of was.
5271420	5273420	If you were newer to the game, it still kind of was.
5274620	5278140	Anyway, all right, let's move on.
5278940	5283180	Let's go back to a simpler time when the police were policing and not playing video games
5283180	5283580	on the job.
5283580	5285980	But if they were playing video games, they might've been playing this.
5287180	5290220	Let me play the bumper for the segment and then we'll explain.
5290780	5293420	No, I think actually we need to explain how it's different first because I don't have
5293420	5293900	a lot of time.
5293900	5295340	I've already talked about it before.
5295340	5296940	I know, but you did it on the no show.
5296940	5298540	You haven't done it on the podcast.
5298540	5301340	So I didn't let the on the show that didn't last either.
5302380	5305900	I thought we didn't get to the segment last week, but I talked about it.
5305900	5306220	All right.
5306220	5308860	Anyway, well, let's let's remind people.
5308860	5312380	We have a 2022 twist this year on the classic game of the week.
5312380	5317020	So once a month, and finally we're getting to it this month, dark soccer is going to
5317020	5318460	pick something different.
5318460	5319820	We've done classic soundtracks.
5319900	5321420	We've done classic 8-bit games.
5321420	5323580	We've done classic peripherals.
5323580	5326060	And for 2022, dark soccer is going to do.
5327260	5330140	I'm doing classic electronic handheld game.
5330140	5330780	All right.
5330780	5333340	So that being said, let's get to the bumper.
5344780	5349340	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault.
5349900	5352620	And pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5352620	5355260	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5356780	5360460	And she means, of course, classic electronic handheld.
5360460	5361340	This is oops.
5361900	5363980	And of course, the wrong screen is up.
5365980	5367020	Go me.
5367020	5369740	Let's try flipping that around a little bit.
5369740	5371900	And gosh, darn it.
5372620	5373820	The tab accidentally closed.
5373820	5374220	That's all right.
5374220	5377340	Let me go back to the main show shots and dark soccer.
5377340	5380860	Why don't you start talking about this and I will get in.
5380860	5381900	I'll get the footage up.
5381900	5382400	Sorry.
5383900	5388620	The game is the Tomy handheld Tron game.
5388620	5389420	That's the first one.
5389420	5391260	It came out in 1982.
5392940	5395580	It is one of three different games.
5396940	5400940	It contains, sorry, three games that were based on different action sequences in Tron.
5401580	5405500	In the first one, you are playing a light cycle game around the game grid and you got
5405500	5407820	to cut off the other drivers.
5407820	5414220	The second one, Tron versus Sark, throw discs at each other, kind of like Pong.
5415100	5418620	So, you know, but it's the whole ring fighting game.
5419740	5424540	And then the last one, you have to throw your disc into the heart of the MCP to destroy
5424540	5425040	it.
5425820	5431100	Once it's done, then you start over faster with a higher level of difficulty.
5431580	5436220	Um, and this thing, it definitely looks very 80s.
5436220	5441820	You know, it's the whole sort of square boxy shape, you know, with big button and everything
5441820	5442780	a switch in the middle.
5443500	5451580	Um, it's, it's actually, I mean, keep in mind, this is, this was top notch when, when I was
5451580	5452080	six.
5452620	5457740	So, uh, this is still top notch at me being 43.
5457740	5458300	Are you kidding?
5458300	5459020	This looks rad.
5459900	5466140	Well, and it was called, um, they were called the, the TomyTronic, um, electric games.
5466700	5470540	They also did like, they had a scramble was one of them.
5470540	5475100	There was a Pac-Man that was circular, like a disc.
5475100	5479740	And it was one of the, uh, TomyTronic ones.
5479740	5484380	You know, they, they did a bunch of different ones like that, but I brought up the Tron
5484380	5487660	one in particular because we love Tron here.
5487740	5488700	We love Tron here.
5490300	5491740	We, we love Tron in this house.
5493740	5496380	And I thought that this one would be a neat one, you know?
5496380	5501100	Um, and it is, it is pretty, pretty cool.
5501100	5508620	You know, you have the different light colors on the screen and it was all just, it was,
5508620	5511260	it was pretty, pretty tops when, when it came out.
5513180	5514860	And on top of that, the box was cool.
5515740	5517580	Just that big old Tron logo on it.
5518940	5525180	Of course, um, we, uh, there was one that was released, of course.
5525180	5527900	Uh, there was a Japanese one, there was a US one.
5528620	5532380	Um, they, you know, they had their own little manuals and everything.
5532380	5533740	They were pretty cool.
5533740	5538380	Of course, our manuals were in black and white and the Japanese ones had pink accents on
5538380	5541340	them, but that's it.
5541580	5544700	Not a lot to talk about.
5546620	5546940	Okay.
5546940	5547260	Sorry.
5547260	5551980	I, you caught me running back in the room from a potty break, but I was watching the
5551980	5555180	B-roll earlier and it, this is like a machine I want to get my hands on.
5555740	5557100	How did you, and I'm sorry if I missed it.
5557100	5559820	How did you find, or how did you know of this?
5559820	5561340	Did you have a friend that had one or something?
5562380	5569340	I had the TomyTronic, uh, Pac-Man when I was a kid.
5570140	5570940	Gotcha.
5570940	5575260	But I knew about the Tron one cause I had been on this big, like Tron kick.
5576220	5577580	So I knew about it.
5578460	5578960	Gotcha.
5579580	5582780	Uh, looking at some comments in chat, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, I would have totally
5582780	5584780	gotten this if I saw it as a kid.
5584780	5587420	Uh, you were a kid, you didn't have your own money, Matt.
5587980	5588540	That's all right.
5588540	5595260	You would ask Santa for, or, uh, like I think I had one like a few years after, after it
5595260	5597980	came out, like at a, from like a thrift store or something.
5598700	5599980	Um, Ziba in chat.
5599980	5605260	There was also like alien attack, which was also a neat one.
5605260	5607420	Uh, Ziba in chat says, this is interesting.
5607420	5607740	Yeah.
5607740	5610860	And a lot of folks in chat saying, wow, I never heard of this, but this looks really
5610860	5611500	cool.
5611500	5617020	Well, this might be a theme that is repeated throughout the year 2022 as dark soccer gets
5617020	5620060	into the classic electronic handhelds of the week.
5620060	5625020	Cause I imagine, you know, most of our listeners, I know the hosts of the show are pretty much
5625020	5627740	in their forties at this point, but a lot of the listeners, I think are more in their
5627740	5628940	twenties and thirties.
5628940	5632860	So, um, literally a lot of machines that came out before you were born.
5632860	5637980	Um, and even for us, like we were young kids when these types of machines are out.
5637980	5640860	So, um, I think there's going to be a lot of eBay listing.
5641580	5642860	How much do they want for these on eBay?
5643660	5647740	Uh, one of the mid range ones is 180 bucks.
5648460	5649100	Jesus.
5650060	5654540	And I'll link it in chat so that people can see, uh, some of the pictures on it.
5654540	5660220	But, um, but it's, it's, you know, it's a neat way to see what it looked like all sides
5660220	5661180	of it and everything.
5661180	5662700	It's, it's, it's pretty cool.
5663260	5663660	All right.
5664300	5664860	Well, there it is.
5664860	5668060	Your classic electronic handheld of the week.
5668060	5668700	Very cool.
5668700	5669100	Love it.
5669740	5670140	All right.
5670940	5675660	Let us now go around and do some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines
5675660	5678220	happening amongst the game real quickly.
5678220	5682780	Bobby Black with a chat says, I mean, some of us spend $800 on replica cabinets.
5682780	5686140	So $180 for something like this is what I expected.
5686940	5687740	$800.
5687740	5690700	Bobby, are we not going to talk about the rush table?
5691260	5692940	Cause we should talk about the rush table.
5694300	5696380	Are we not going to talk about everything that's in my house?
5697580	5698220	Exactly.
5699500	5703740	Which while Bobby starting his own little, he's starting the, uh, uh, East coast version
5703740	5707100	of that, uh, in the, in Bobby Bay, Bobby theater at Bobby Manor.
5707660	5708300	So, all right.
5710220	5710700	All right.
5710700	5713420	Moving on, let's get to some rapid fire news.
5713420	5713920	Loki.
5714940	5715340	All right.
5715340	5721980	So apparently we just found out that the Xbox one was, uh, they stopped production on it
5721980	5722860	a couple of years ago.
5723420	5731820	So apparently, um, we just found out that the Xbox one S, uh, was stopped in production
5731820	5734460	at the end of 2020.
5734460	5744220	And that the Xbox one X, um, apparently, well, that was stopped in, I guess, uh, July of
5744220	5745500	2020.
5745500	5751820	So now we know, not that it makes a difference.
5751820	5755900	That was the wildest headline, you know, for them to come out and just be like, Oh, by
5755900	5758140	the way, the Xbox one is done.
5758140	5762540	Like I can't, I actually kind of admire them for being able to kind of like stealthily
5762540	5765020	do that so that people would miss it.
5765660	5769420	Because, you know, if they came out and said, we're going to be ending the Xbox one in two
5769420	5773900	months, everyone would have said, Oh, I'll never be able to get one.
5775020	5778780	And you know, there would have been just ends for them to, it's such a, yeah, it's not such
5778780	5781420	a big deal since everything's kind of backwards compatible anyways.
5781420	5787020	So yeah, it's, it's very, uh, bold of them to be like, we got rid of this months ago
5787020	5788220	and none of you noticed.
5788220	5795500	So moving on as very, uh, very gaslight gatekeep girl boss, uh, on Microsoft part.
5795500	5795820	Yes.
5796860	5802300	So, and then of course, um, following up, going back to our predictions for the air
5802300	5809180	and house, uh, you know, CEOs of these corporate giants that is make way too much
5809180	5809660	money.
5809660	5812300	And a lot of times they're really toxic people.
5812300	5816220	Well, now we have a list of those toxic people and the money that they made.
5816220	5821180	So, uh, you know, Bobby, Bobby Kotick made $154 million.
5822060	5827900	Um, we have, uh, Andrew Wilson made $34 million.
5829180	5830300	And then what else?
5830860	5833180	Strauss Zelnick, only $18 million.
5833740	5835260	Man has the money there.
5835820	5844460	I know, uh, the top earner for 2020 was actually Robert, uh, and tookle with a play
5844460	5845020	dig, huh?
5845020	5847500	Never heard of them, but $372 million.
5848540	5856620	And then we also had folks, uh, Andrew paradise from skills and John Riccatello from unity
5856620	5859820	on the list, NC soft razor and team seven.
5859820	5862860	I know none of these names except for John Riccatello.
5862860	5864300	I've heard that one, but none of the, yeah.
5864300	5865100	Oh my God.
5865100	5865660	Wow.
5865660	5872700	Um, and then the very bottom lease out of the 42, uh, was Lars wing of her, uh, which
5872700	5875660	was an bracer group of $162,000.
5876460	5880780	So just every time that they tell you that they need to raise prices of the games, because
5880780	5883820	they're just not making enough money to pay for these games.
5883820	5888060	Maybe they could tap into some of that money that these CEOs are making, because I think
5888060	5892140	$154 million probably goes a long way when it comes to game development.
5893020	5895740	Just a thought, you know, you could live off of the interest.
5897180	5897660	Yeah.
5897660	5900940	That much money would probably pay their developers a little bit more money.
5900940	5904460	You know, so fun.
5905500	5907820	Don't expect it to get any better, only worse.
5909180	5909660	All right.
5909660	5910220	Dark soccer.
5910220	5910860	What do you have for us?
5912300	5915580	So, um, a game I love cotton.
5915580	5921100	The cotton Sega, uh, Saturn classics are going to be coming on to PC before too long.
5921100	5928540	That includes a cotton to cotton boomerang and a guardian force, uh, cotton guardian force.
5928540	5932540	Um, they are beautiful remastered games.
5933100	5939340	The, uh, PS4 and Nintendo switch version, um, uh, were criticized because of input delay
5939340	5940220	issues.
5940220	5945820	And so it looks like there's going to be some, uh, patching done before the release and it
5945820	5946700	should be coming out.
5946700	5951900	And there's also going to be a new sequel cotton rock and roll is being developed to
5951900	5952860	come out later this year.
5953820	5959420	And then also the official logo for the street fighter 35th anniversary is out.
5960300	5965820	Um, and it will be celebrating its 30, 35th anniversary on August 12th.
5965820	5970540	And they have teased things about the future of the series will be announced.
5970540	5976060	So whatever the hell that is street fighter, although we do know there's final DLC.
5977580	5981580	Uh, the, uh, character Luke will have an important role.
5982940	5983440	Hmm.
5984860	5985180	All right.
5986220	5987020	All right.
5987020	5989500	Let's travel around the, I'm sorry, I'm having internet issues again.
5989500	5992860	So sorry if I'm going robot on you guys, but, uh, let's travel around the world and check
5992860	5996220	out some release dates, uh, around the world, starting with the U S Loki.
5997020	6000940	Uh, we have shadow man remastered on Nintendo switch.
6001660	6007740	Uh, nobody saves the world on PC, Xbox one, which is dead, uh, Xbox series X.
6008220	6012220	We have the RP RP golf legends.
6012860	6015660	Uh, I guess that's, it's a role-playing golf game.
6015660	6016300	Awesome.
6016300	6022460	Uh, that's on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, Tom Clancy's rainbow
6022460	6028540	six extraction on PC PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X and Stadia,
6029180	6035980	uh, wind jammers two on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one and Stadia.
6035980	6038940	And last but not least mouse craft on Xbox one.
6040700	6041100	All right.
6041100	6044060	I know I'm a little robot, but in the recording, I'll sound fine.
6044060	6045900	So I'm going to push through for Japan.
6045900	6051500	Uh, the Nintendo switch we'll be seeing, uh, the RP golf legends, uh, is actually releasing
6051500	6051900	over there.
6051900	6055180	It's an English version, but it is getting a Japanese retail release this week on the
6055180	6056300	20th for the switch.
6056300	6058220	And then a game called lucky dog.
6058220	6061980	One is the only really other release on the switch this week in Japan.
6062300	6067260	Taking a look though at the PlayStation five, we have Tom Clancy's rainbow six extraction
6067260	6069180	it's a worldwide, including Japan.
6069180	6074300	So they're getting it as well this week and that's really it for the Japanese releases.
6074300	6077020	So let's check in with dark Sakura and the UK.
6078860	6085820	Um, we have on the 18th, we have surviving the aftermath on the 20th, we have rainbow
6085820	6086780	six extraction.
6087500	6091580	Um, we have expeditions Rome on the 21st.
6091580	6093100	We have never song.
6093100	6098700	We also have black wind and the dungeon of nay Hal book, I guess.
6101260	6102380	I guess that's how it's pronounced.
6103180	6103680	Sure.
6105340	6105840	That's it.
6106460	6107260	All right.
6107260	6109100	Let's get into some more news.
6109100	6109600	Loki.
6110700	6111340	All right.
6111340	6114700	So Sony's making more PlayStations.
6114700	6115820	Isn't that exciting?
6116780	6121820	They just have a four in front of them or after them, not the fives.
6121820	6125500	So apparently since, you know, Hey, the fives are pretty hard to get, uh, we're going to
6125500	6126860	put out more PlayStation fours.
6128940	6134380	Not exactly what people are looking for, but something, I guess I see what you did there
6134380	6135500	looking for.
6138140	6138640	Yeah.
6138640	6140540	So cool.
6142060	6144460	I don't think it's been hard to get a PlayStation four though.
6144540	6151740	So I, I think for some reason they think that this is going to keep people within the Sony
6151740	6153340	brand or something like that.
6153340	6157340	Or maybe they're going to try to leverage more cloud stuff, or it's just the fact that
6157340	6162940	the new exclusives for now are still, as far as I know, PlayStation four and PlayStation
6162940	6164700	five, if I remember right.
6164700	6169980	Um, you know, things like horizon forbidden West is going to play on a PlayStation four.
6169980	6172940	So I guess, I mean,
6173900	6176540	so that's good for the short term.
6176540	6180300	I would just wait, honestly, though, if you're really looking for a PlayStation five, I think
6180300	6184700	a lot of people that are looking for a PlayStation five probably already have a PlayStation four.
6184700	6191340	So, uh, whatever, you know, it'd be ironic as if scalpers also were scalping these just,
6191340	6196700	you know, just to show them just because they can just for the pure spite factor.
6197260	6198460	I hate it.
6198460	6202380	Um, what about, um, can I, can I ask you real quick?
6202380	6203660	Um, hopefully I'm coming through.
6203660	6203980	Okay.
6203980	6208860	Audio wise on your end, but, um, the, um, we didn't quite get to it in the show world
6208860	6212220	tonight, but I've definitely seen the rumors and maybe that's why we didn't show it because
6212220	6217420	more rumors, uh, about the PlayStation three stuff on PlayStation five.
6217420	6221820	Um, I guess there was a listing in a store somewhere that, or like the PlayStation store
6221820	6224060	had a PS three game in it for a hot minute.
6224060	6226380	And this has a lot of people speculating.
6226380	6228540	Um, what do you think of that?
6228540	6232940	That may be backwards compatibility is finally something that Sony is going to be
6234380	6237980	They'll, they'll just be resold games just like they did at the PlayStation two.
6237980	6241180	So digital, digital only and not running off your old disks.
6241740	6242060	Right.
6242060	6242220	Yeah.
6242220	6247500	Cause it'll be even, I think it'll even be like, even if you own a copy of that on the
6247500	6251180	PlayStation three or whatever, that you wouldn't be able to play it because it'd be like a
6251180	6252540	remaster or something like that.
6252540	6256220	I don't remember if that's exactly how, I mean, obviously that would be how it had the
6256220	6257660	work on the PlayStation two.
6257660	6263020	Cause they didn't have a digital storefront for PlayStation two, um, for the PlayStation
6263020	6269820	two, but, uh, for the PlayStation three, I would hope that like, if I own the game digitally
6269820	6272860	that I could just play it digitally.
6272860	6277340	But if they're going to sell it to you again, I'm sure that they're going to want that
6277340	6278860	opportunity to sell to you again.
6279900	6283980	That would be incredibly shitty if like my digital library didn't roll over company that
6283980	6286620	also charges $70 for their games.
6286620	6287900	So yeah, I know.
6289340	6295020	Um, I I'm curious though, too, cause a lot of folks are noticing that the PlayStation
6295020	6297580	now prepaid cards are starting to disappear.
6297580	6299740	I guess that's been a whole thing as well.
6299740	6305740	And folks are thinking that this, well, folks are thinking that this rumored PlayStation
6305740	6309020	plus and cloud gaming getting rolled into that.
6309020	6312380	And that whole thing may be all coming to a head here.
6312380	6316140	Um, that all of this is kind of together.
6316140	6318940	Like it's not a coincidence that this is all happening at once.
6318940	6320620	And that may be the PlayStation three stuff.
6320620	6322380	Is it all going to be cloud stuff?
6324620	6325260	Cool.
6325260	6327340	I, yeah, I don't know.
6327340	6329900	Like, isn't that already cloud stuff now?
6329900	6333420	I mean, like, it's just, I just don't want PlayStation now.
6333420	6333900	Period.
6333900	6338460	Like if, if like they had the, uh, I don't even know if they have the option of like
6338460	6339100	download stuff.
6339100	6340540	It's just, that's not interesting to me.
6340540	6343100	I have a ton of games on the PlayStation.
6343100	6346860	I just, I don't play PlayStation anymore.
6346860	6349900	I don't want it either, especially with my shitty internet these days.
6350460	6351100	Yeah, exactly.
6351100	6354620	Like, like it's like, Oh, but you can, you can stream it.
6354620	6355260	Okay, cool.
6355980	6357340	Don't want to do that though.
6357340	6359900	Like I'd rather just play the disc I have or something.
6359900	6360140	Leo.
6360140	6363660	It's like, I don't, whatever.
6363660	6364140	That's fine.
6364940	6365260	All right.
6365900	6370380	I thought this was an interesting thing that kind of, uh, crossed my desk.
6370380	6373900	This week is one of those things that dark Tetsuya put down in front of my eyes and was
6373900	6374620	like, look at this.
6374620	6375820	Cause this is interesting.
6375820	6376460	And I agree.
6376460	6379260	This is an article that a vice was running.
6379260	6380620	Uh, and I thought this was neat.
6380620	6387900	Uh, apparently the y'all know, I'm sure anybody that is around our age knows of the epic NES
6387900	6388860	emulator.
6388860	6392780	Nesticle was the name of it, which is a little bit dirty, but that was the point.
6393420	6395820	And there was also a followup emulator of sorts.
6395820	6398780	There was Genesis that would play the Genesis games.
6398780	6399260	Right.
6399260	6403660	And the big deal about those emulators is that they were really the first bit.
6403660	6408460	They weren't the first emulators, but they were the first to do it so well on a lower
6408460	6410860	end computer that these, these.
6410860	6412860	Emulators really caught fire.
6412860	6419180	And, uh, I can tell you like those that my college years, those were huge and instrumental
6419180	6420060	about those years.
6420620	6427260	And there never was really a super Nesticle or SNES, which obviously kind of became the
6427260	6429260	next thing that got emulated after the Genesis.
6429260	6432140	And I remember, I think the big ones back in the day were like ZSNES.
6432140	6435660	And I think there was another one, but we never really saw what the maker, cause it
6435660	6438140	was one guy that did Nesticle.
6438140	6441260	He might've had help or whatever, but it was basically all credited to one guy, Sardu,
6441260	6442140	that did this.
6442140	6448220	And, and I remember asking this question on a episode in the past, but that guy ended
6448220	6449500	up going to work for EA.
6450380	6454300	Sardu went to work for EA and he ended up working on sports titles.
6454860	6461340	And there's a big aha moment with all this because apparently what happened is that there
6461340	6467500	was an Easter egg in a GameCube game that would run Super Punch-Out.
6467500	6471820	So, uh, the GameCube game was Fight Night round two.
6471820	6475260	And in this Easter egg, you could actually play Super Punch-Out.
6475260	6479980	Well, somebody through looking through the code found out that that whole thing was running
6479980	6485180	on SNES-ticle, Super Nesticle, basically.
6485180	6492540	So his original vision or whatever for, for what Super Nesticle was going to be, it was
6492540	6494380	essentially bought by EA.
6494380	6497900	Kind of going back to that whole comment Dark Soccer said earlier about when you do something
6497900	6499420	for a company, the company now owns it.
6499420	6499980	That's big.
6499980	6504780	So EA bought themselves some SNES-ticles basically to use as this.
6504780	6508620	Now, obviously retro programming is not the only thing that the author is, you know, I'm
6508620	6511180	sure doing at this point, but it is very interesting.
6511180	6512380	Now, why is this relevant?
6512380	6515740	We're talking about an old ass GameCube game in the Super Nesticle.
6515740	6519180	Well, for one, I think a lot of people would be interested, like whatever happened to that,
6519180	6521980	you know, that guy and his emulators and things like that.
6521980	6530540	But what happened, a Swedish programmer recently, Johannes Holmberg, took this knowledge and
6530540	6537820	basically reverse engineered Fight Night Round 2 to isolate that emulator.
6538700	6541020	And it was only used to play Super Punch-Out.
6541020	6542780	So who knew if it could run anything else?
6543820	6545900	But it's now on GitHub.
6545900	6551580	There's a Python script on GitHub called the SNES-ticle Liberation Project, which you can
6551580	6557980	find the URLs kind of long, but maybe somebody, if you can even hear me in chat right now,
6557980	6558700	can link that.
6559500	6563500	But yeah, it's basically a disk image file that will run SNES-ticle.
6563500	6566620	And apparently most Super Nintendo games do run.
6567340	6573180	Of course, they have to do more testing and there's even Mode 7 effects in it.
6573180	6577020	And it's pointed out Super Punch-Out didn't really use those, but there are issues.
6577020	6581340	Some of the controller mapping is a little wild and there is no two player support.
6581340	6584620	So there's better Super Nintendo emulators out there.
6585340	6590860	But I think this is very interesting because Sardu's particular emulators were such a huge
6590860	6594300	part of the history of emulators when all is said and done.
6594300	6598860	I think this particular piece of work was very interesting to a lot of people.
6598860	6603980	And I don't know if you think about it, the author of this thing.
6603980	6606940	The guy that made Nesticle is probably like 40 or 50 now.
6606940	6611020	So who knows how much he wants to be remembered for this type of stuff.
6611020	6613900	But I just think it's very interesting.
6613900	6614460	I really do.
6615180	6617820	So yeah, looking in chat.
6617820	6620060	Oh, the other Super Nintendo emulator, I couldn't remember.
6620620	6622460	SNES 9X.
6622460	6623180	That was the other one.
6623180	6625020	They were kind of two that were big at the time.
6625020	6626860	Yeah, good call out, you guys.
6626860	6628780	That was always the one I used was SNES 9X.
6628780	6629420	Yeah, yeah.
6629420	6632620	One of them would do like internet multiplayer, but it really wasn't good.
6632620	6636380	But I remember playing, I think I finally played through something like Secret of Evermore
6636380	6637180	on one of those emulators.
6637180	6638780	It was like Beast Nest as well.
6638780	6640380	I mean, there was some of the Mac ones too.
6640380	6643500	Like right now, I'm actually, I'm trying out Openemu.
6644540	6645040	Yeah.
6645580	6648380	It's just supposed to be like multi machine emulation.
6649340	6651980	Dr. Tsuya in chat says, I just thought it was a really cool story.
6651980	6655180	I remember hearing about SNESicle and the hidden Super Punch-Out.
6655180	6658860	Yeah, I think it's fascinating because, and especially because like, again, those were
6658860	6661660	my college years were playing the shit out of those emulators.
6661660	6667820	And I know it's an illegal gray area, but being able to keep that at the forefront of
6667820	6673580	my mind, enabled me to buy these retro collections all these years later and actually sign up
6673580	6678460	for the Nintendo Switch online and spend way more than I'd care to admit on virtual console.
6678460	6681020	It's almost as if you legally put the emulators out.
6681020	6683100	A lot of times people will take advantage of it.
6683100	6683740	That's for sure.
6685340	6688940	Fifth Dream in chat says he just worked at EA back then, so he may have just stuck it
6688940	6690220	in and now it's EA's.
6690220	6691980	I doubt he just stuck it in.
6692940	6697180	I don't think you do that when you're a new guy, you know, working on a game like that.
6697180	6700300	I think they knew he built emulators.
6700940	6703340	They had the rights to do this particular thing.
6703340	6704540	They wanted it done well.
6704540	6707900	And I think they used, I think they basically bought this guy's code to do it.
6708700	6710380	So, interesting.
6711420	6711820	All right.
6712380	6713980	Anyhow, let's move on.
6713980	6714700	Dark Sakura.
6716300	6724140	So, and I actually, I had posted this on my Twitter not long ago, but SNK versus Capcom
6724140	6726700	Card Fighters Clash is on the Switch now.
6726700	6727580	You can just go get it.
6728220	6730780	It is a port of the Neo Geo Pocket Color game.
6732140	6733900	And it's $7.99.
6733900	6735180	You can get it in the eShop.
6735820	6739500	It's got characters all over both companies' history.
6739500	6742300	And it was really popular and really fun.
6742300	6743420	We've got the originals.
6745100	6747740	We were totally into playing a bunch of that, remember?
6747740	6748140	Yeah.
6748140	6752220	And I was, but this was, this was part of why I thought like this is very much like
6752220	6753900	a Jamie alert for this week.
6753900	6757660	And I know a lot of people were pleasantly surprised by the release of this on the Switch
6757660	6759340	because it really did kind of come out of nowhere.
6761580	6761980	Yeah.
6761980	6765580	Well, I saw a post about it.
6765580	6766940	I reposted it.
6766940	6772460	I haven't gotten it yet, but I mean, it's definitely, I don't know.
6772460	6777180	It's kind of one of those things that's like, I've got the original and I'm kind of don't
6777180	6780620	want to go back and play it, but I know a lot of people do and a lot of people missed
6780620	6780700	it.
6780700	6781180	So it's great.
6781180	6781820	It's a great one.
6784860	6785500	All right.
6785500	6787500	Especially because it has last blade characters in it.
6787500	6788220	That makes me happy.
6789580	6793580	So just quickly going back to the last story, because I'm pretty impressed with what Bobby
6793580	6796780	Black Wolf is doing with his research here on Sardu and where he's been.
6797500	6803500	Apparently Bobby found the LinkedIn profile and he works at Tiburon in Orlando.
6803500	6804620	So he works on Madden.
6804620	6806540	So that's all on the public LinkedIn profile.
6806540	6812380	And on the age portion, he graduated high school in 94, which if I remember correct
6812380	6813020	was the same year.
6813820	6814140	Yeah.
6814140	6815740	So he's exactly your age.
6815740	6818060	So that's what am I doing with my life?
6818060	6821020	Well, a lot, a lot.
6821020	6823020	You've done a podcast for 20 years.
6823020	6823900	Where's your emulator?
6825340	6826140	I'll emulate.
6828300	6829420	That's still, you know what though?
6829420	6833580	But the fact that, you know, the fact that he wrote an emulator then at a relatively
6833580	6837420	young age, so he did that in college and it was better than anything else.
6837420	6841660	It was so good that other game companies wanted to buy that talent.
6842220	6843900	That's very impressive.
6843900	6848860	I hope he's making buku bucks at EA and, and that's the, that's the person that should
6848860	6850700	be on the highest paid list.
6850700	6852060	Not these fucking CEOs.
6853340	6853980	Seriously.
6854860	6855260	All right.
6856140	6861500	Anyway, uh, Loki, speaking of people that should get paid, uh, people that, um, clean
6861500	6863820	the internet of garbage should definitely get paid, right?
6864780	6865180	Right.
6865180	6866220	Yes, exactly.
6866220	6874620	So apparently Twitch has purged over 15 million hate raid bots, uh, as of last year, um, to
6874620	6876620	which I have the follow-up question.
6876620	6880220	How were there 15 million hate raid bots on Twitch?
6882140	6885020	They weren't doing, uh, account verification at the time.
6885020	6890300	And since they brought in the account verification, it's taking quite a bit for, uh, some of
6890300	6892140	these bot accounts to get around it now.
6892140	6895020	They're so, have you ever looked at the viewer list when you're streaming though?
6895020	6900780	I have so many bots that hang out in my channel and for the most viewers are just lurkers.
6900780	6901580	They're there.
6901580	6906540	They're neither it's, I believe, you know, somebody feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
6906540	6914620	I believe that because Twitch's chat system is essentially a customized version of IRC,
6914620	6916460	which we used to use back in the day.
6916460	6917820	Right back in the day.
6917820	6917980	Yeah.
6917980	6919500	Which actually really wasn't that long ago.
6919500	6925260	If you think about it, we've only been on Twitch since like 2018, but, um, IRC, basically
6925260	6927580	Twitch is running off a customized version of that.
6927580	6932860	So I think a lot of these bots, and I think like Nightbot kind of leverages that a little
6932860	6933100	bit.
6933100	6937820	It doesn't really watch your channel, but it's leveraging those IRC skeleton portions
6937820	6940220	to, uh, respond to commands in this case.
6940220	6949180	But you have all these other bots that are lurking, to which suddenly lurkers are speaking
6949180	6952060	up and chat rep cycled says, uh, I'm real.
6952060	6952700	I promise.
6953260	6953980	All right.
6953980	6957820	No, I luckily I've seen your name before, so I know you're real, but I'm talking about
6957820	6960940	in my personal stream, it'll say I have two viewers.
6960940	6964220	And then I look at the list of who's in the channel and there's all these bots and you
6964220	6965420	can tell their bot names.
6965420	6967740	And I'm like, do I ban them?
6967740	6969020	Cause they seem harmless.
6969820	6972860	Like I just would like to know what data they're collecting.
6973660	6975980	Some, some of them are analytic bots.
6975980	6977980	Some of them do belong to Twitch.
6977980	6978380	Yeah.
6978460	6982300	I'm fine with analytics and data and just curious Kathy's.
6982300	6983500	I'm fine with all that.
6983500	6986860	I, you know, it's obviously it's the haters that can go away.
6986860	6991580	Like right now I have a bunch of people that are left in here from when I did my marathon
6991580	6993260	who haven't left.
6994300	6994540	Yeah.
6994540	7000940	But like I have things like meta view, you know, just different trying to, you know,
7000940	7003740	another TT, another TTV viewer.
7003740	7004460	I've seen that one.
7004540	7007740	So, so these are all just analytic.
7007740	7009020	Some of them are analytic ones.
7009020	7015180	Some of them are legit people, you know, uh, actually, you know, friends, you can click
7015180	7016540	on, on the name.
7016540	7021420	Like I'm clicking on just a bunch of names in a row and these are like actual people.
7023100	7025660	Although my favorite one right now is broke my stream deck.
7026780	7030140	Uh, and, and lurkers, you can feel free to lurk.
7030140	7031980	I, I do not mind a lurker.
7031980	7033420	I lurk in a lot of channels.
7033420	7034700	I lurk in dark soccer's channel.
7034700	7035980	Cause I like to watch on my Xbox.
7036620	7038220	I saw you in there too.
7038220	7038620	Yeah.
7038620	7039260	Still lurking.
7039900	7049500	I, I am fully down to, uh, to, um, what's the word I'm thinking of?
7049500	7052700	To, to let people, you know, hang out and lurk.
7052700	7054060	I'll, I'll leave names in there.
7054060	7059260	It's the moment that they start actually saying something that's harmful to my community.
7059260	7059760	Oh, yeah.
7060380	7060700	Barf.
7060700	7060940	Yeah.
7060940	7064700	Then, then, no, I'm not, um, I'm, I'm not down for that.
7064700	7066700	I'm gonna ban them.
7066700	7071740	There were also, um, I was using this tool that, that bourbon linked a while back.
7072540	7078540	Um, who, uh, another awesome, uh, DBD and a new world streamer.
7079100	7085660	Um, there was a tool that will let you look through your, um, your history of like who
7085660	7090380	joined at like a certain time and by certain names and then let you just mass ban them.
7090380	7091100	Oh, interesting.
7091100	7092860	Which was wonderful.
7092860	7097100	I've, I've got the tool somewhere and sometimes I still use it.
7097740	7102620	That's why I like for my follower goal, my follower goal is like a few, you know,
7102620	7105660	as it shows on my stream is a few off than what I actually have.
7106780	7110940	So, um, yeah, it's kind of weird that way.
7110940	7114780	It's funny you mentioned him too, because that's a perfect example of one of those channels.
7114780	7119100	I think I've maybe ever said one thing in the chat room, but I've watched a lot just on my
7119100	7121980	Xbox, like in the background when I'm, you know, doing it.
7121980	7123420	So it's just, it's just funny.
7123420	7127020	I have a lot of Twitch people like that where I haven't really, and there's others where like,
7127020	7128300	I participate and it's nothing like.
7129260	7130380	He's a great streamer.
7130380	7132620	I wouldn't watch him in the first place, but it's just, you know,
7132620	7134780	sometimes I'm just not able to actively chat.
7134780	7136300	So I just lurk, you know?
7137340	7141340	For me, it's weird to come out and suddenly say, hi, I'm watching.
7141340	7145340	Yeah, he's, he's one of the ones that I can give shit to and get it back.
7145340	7146140	And it's pretty fun.
7147180	7147820	That's good.
7147820	7148220	That's good.
7149180	7150700	Tease him for his toxic Steve.
7152460	7152860	All right.
7152860	7158460	But yeah, but at any rate, I think that whatever it is that Twitch did,
7158460	7163820	and I want to say that that verified user thing is a pretty big step in it.
7163820	7164320	Yeah.
7164940	7167580	I haven't seen very many hate raids.
7167580	7173020	If anything, in some of my bigger streamer friends chats, I have seen,
7173020	7180300	um, like a person come in and well, uh, actually a funny scenario was, um,
7181500	7183580	it was, was it Lily Pie I was watching?
7183580	7184540	I think it was Lily Pie.
7185180	7189980	Um, who this person just came in being like this racist piece of shit.
7189980	7192940	And she's like, I played like three ads while this person was in my chat.
7195580	7196860	So I made money off of them.
7197420	7199020	And then they take themselves out.
7199660	7200380	Yeah.
7200380	7205500	So yeah, there's, there's, yeah, I, I've seen a few spam bots and some occasional
7205500	7209980	nerdom, uh, nerdy things and not in the good kind of way in people's chat, but,
7209980	7214700	uh, yeah, for the most part, like it seems that a lot of the tactics, which has been
7214700	7216700	using has been effective and that's good.
7216700	7218220	No, that's about time.
7218220	7220060	Good way to start off 2022.
7220060	7224460	I still think that they need to do something about their auto banning system.
7225340	7232140	Because there were, there were people that were getting banned, um, for just for like
7232140	7234780	stuff that wasn't actually like a real offense.
7236380	7239180	And of course, nobody responds to it.
7239180	7241020	They'd stay banned for that 30 days.
7241020	7244540	And then it's a strike, especially bad for people who are trying to go for partner.
7244540	7245040	Right.
7245580	7246080	Yeah.
7246620	7251980	Which I could use another, you know, 70 people watching my stream at any given point in time.
7252060	7253100	So could vog.
7253100	7254060	So could my channel.
7255100	7260940	It's just finding that wave to make you, uh, carry carry further.
7261500	7262300	So, yeah.
7262300	7262800	All right.
7263180	7268540	Um, speaking of big things on Twitch, uh, we have to, of course, in our last slotted
7268540	7273900	story spot tonight, talk about AGDQ or awesome games done quick.
7273900	7278380	And I'm sure many of you that listen to our show also listen to Bobby Black Wolf, who
7278380	7280700	is live before us on Sunday nights.
7281180	7285980	And I would encourage you to check out his podcast if you are a podcast person and not
7285980	7287100	hearing his show live.
7287660	7292780	But our pal Bobby was one of the hosts for this and hosted some of the speed runs.
7292780	7295580	And I saw, um, I saw the earthbound one, a little bit of that.
7295580	7296700	That was a lot of fun.
7296700	7299100	And I watched some of the ones he wasn't hosting too.
7299100	7303740	It's always a good event, very well received by, um, I think the gaming community, a lot
7303740	7305340	of positive vibes in that chat room.
7305340	7307260	They limited to subscribers only.
7307260	7311900	So I honestly just that alone clears out a lot of the garbage, uh, because, you know,
7311900	7316940	I, and I don't think subscribers only is an effective tactic for streamers like dark
7316940	7321180	soccer myself, where we don't have the 70 plus people watching, but when you have 50,000
7321180	7323820	people watching, it's very effective at keeping a lot of the trash out.
7323820	7325260	So, um, they do a good job with that.
7325260	7328540	And it's kind of fun to watch, uh, chat sometimes in there.
7328540	7333500	Um, but games done quick also shattered records.
7333500	7336540	They raised 3.4 million.
7336540	7341260	That is the largest amount of money that games done quick, either summer or winter
7341260	7343820	and the awesome version has ever raised.
7343820	7346140	And, uh, that was for the prevent cancer foundation.
7346140	7347420	So that's really cool.
7347420	7352700	Also during the marathon, there were some new world records set, meaning the fastest
7352700	7358220	games have ever been run, uh, including, uh, newer games like Kina bridge of spirits.
7358220	7365340	Uh, and then, uh, pumpkin Jack, uh, Sekiro shadows die twice was a blindfolded that had
7365340	7365900	a lot of people.
7365900	7369260	I don't think that was a world record, but that was a, uh, uh, thing that had a lot of
7369260	7369820	people.
7369820	7370060	Yeah.
7371420	7372460	I'm trying to teach crazy.
7372460	7375420	That was just pretty, pretty awesome.
7375420	7376140	Pretty incredible.
7376140	7376940	It really is.
7376940	7378700	So, uh, yeah, lots of good stuff to see.
7378700	7383660	I, a lot of people were tweeting me about the, uh, not itg, which was like basically
7384540	7389580	DDR and in the groove, just bananas level, like that level that just makes me exhausted
7389580	7393660	looking at it and going like, oh, I'm definitely 40 years old.
7393660	7397340	Uh, and that whole thing, but, um, props to the people that can do it.
7397340	7402780	It's a very impressive show and help to raise all the money and smash the records at the
7402780	7403260	end of the day.
7403820	7405020	And isn't that what it's all about?
7406460	7407100	All right.
7407100	7407340	Yeah.
7407900	7408300	Awesome.
7409020	7409500	All right.
7409500	7411980	Uh, let's get to the listener round table.
7411980	7415740	Unfortunately with the internet cutting in and out, I know the live folks are having
7415740	7416300	a hard time.
7416300	7417740	I think they can still hear us.
7417740	7419180	I know they can't see us.
7419180	7421660	It's just blitzing in and out.
7421660	7424940	I'm so sorry, but it's, there's really nothing I can do about it.
7424940	7430780	Um, I will, I have a lot more to say on this next week for episode 900.
7430780	7434620	Uh, I'll unfortunately, yes, I'm announcing an announcement, but I will leave you tease
7434620	7435500	till then.
7435500	7438860	Um, so, uh, just don't expect this to last forever.
7438860	7440220	That's all I have to say.
7440220	7443420	Uh, assuming that ding dong is the power going to be going out.
7444380	7446860	Oh, is, oh, your power is about to, oh boy.
7446860	7447260	Oh boy.
7447260	7448220	What an ending.
7448220	7448540	All right.
7448540	7453340	Well, before we end, let me try to see if we got any emails at least to get into tonight.
7454220	7454940	Okay, cool.
7454940	7457740	Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.
7457740	7461100	If you want to send us an email, uh, let's get to the one email that we got this week.
7461820	7463340	This is back from the seventh.
7463340	7464940	Um, hi, OLR.
7464940	7469580	I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the quote fluff discussions on the post Christmas
7469580	7473500	episode on the subject of free games that turned out to be a pleasant surprise.
7473500	7477740	I bought a game boy advance on eBay a few years ago and it came with DK King of swing.
7478300	7483020	I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it to be truly excellent and underrated platform
7483020	7483500	game.
7483500	7488780	The L and R buttons control each of donkey, uh, of donkey Kong's hands, which you use
7488780	7492220	to grab pegs and swing yourself across around the stages.
7492220	7493180	Super fun.
7493180	7497580	Anyway, I hope y'all, uh, you all are staying safe and please keep up the good work Elliot B.
7500380	7501420	Thank you for the email.
7501420	7504940	And I love that, uh, the, the random stuff that you come across.
7505660	7508220	And I thought the fluff segment thing worked out really well too.
7508220	7511740	Um, you know, most weeks we actually have news to talk about, so I don't know how regular
7511740	7512940	that segment will be.
7512940	7513820	Uh, but thank you.
7513820	7514700	I'm glad you enjoyed it.
7514700	7516780	It was a fun, uh, fun, fun night.
7516780	7517500	So I'm sorry.
7517500	7522780	It took us like four weeks to answer it, but, uh, it is 2022.
7522780	7524620	It's just my God.
7525340	7525900	It's all right.
7525900	7526540	Sucks.
7526540	7527100	It's all right.
7527100	7529340	Things are gonna, things are gonna look onward and upward.
7529340	7531820	Participate at orange launcher trader.com.
7531820	7534140	If you have something you want to contribute in the future.
7534140	7537820	Um, Loki, did you have any last minute stories you wanted to talk to us about?
7539580	7542940	I don't, I don't.
7545020	7545520	Okay.
7546700	7550540	Well, unfortunately, uh, with the internet stuff, I think at least we got through a show,
7550540	7554220	but I think the forces that be are kind of telling us perhaps it is time to just go ahead
7554220	7555180	and wrap things up.
7555180	7557900	And so I think that is what we will do for the night.
7557900	7560940	Uh, Hey, we got two hours out at least I'm happy.
7560940	7562700	It's uh, and the show was good.
7562700	7564060	Uh, it's just, yeah.
7565900	7570860	So much to say, and I'm going to say some stuff soon, but until then, let's go around
7570860	7573580	and get everybody's final thoughts and dark soccer.
7573580	7574460	I'll start with you tonight.
7575980	7577980	Um, eat your vegetables.
7579020	7579520	Okay.
7580380	7581100	Broccoli is good.
7582140	7582300	Bye.
7582300	7582940	Have a good stream.
7583820	7584140	All right.
7584140	7584700	Thank you.
7584700	7585260	Yep.
7585260	7587900	Hopefully, uh, some more depths in dark soccer's future tonight.
7588540	7589100	All right.
7589100	7593900	Uh, meanwhile, uh, I'll say my final thought and, uh, I just pretty much already said it,
7593900	7599020	but I was going to say, uh, next week is 900 episodes of OLR, which is no small feat.
7599020	7603020	And I want to thank all of you that stick with us through thick and thin be at the podcast
7603020	7607100	feed to be at here live through bandwidth, suffrage and all that stuff.
7607100	7608460	Uh, really appreciate it.

7619420	7624380	Um, so I will, uh, talk about that and it's going to be, uh, it's also going to, it is
7624380	7628060	going to affect the show, but it's going to be, I think, I think good stuff.

7649020	7650460	I played more of that this week.
7650460	7653900	Um, but I only did, I only did like maybe another hour and a half, but, uh, I'm still,
7653900	7658300	I'm still enjoying it enough, uh, as much as the font still bothers me, but it is what
7658300	7659100	it is.
7659100	7659580	All right.
