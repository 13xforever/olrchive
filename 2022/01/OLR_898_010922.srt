1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
Don't talk about NFTs, don't talk about NFTs, don't talk about NFTs!

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,840
This week, Gamestop, the once video game turned collectible turned toy turned NFT market po...

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,840
Classic Orange Lounge radio fans were delighted to hear that Konami has revealed a Castlevania

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,480
and a... for crying out loud.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,680
Sega says they won't release something that is an empty cash grab, like NFTs!

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,200
And now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about NFTs!

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,320
And the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,320
a voice.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:46,720
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,480
where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,480
It is Orange Lounge Radio back with you once again for the first show of our 20th broadcast

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
year.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:06,360
2002 episode one to today, episode 898 for this January 9th of 2022.

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,760
I am Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my co-hosts who I actually I'm going to introduce out

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,160
of order tonight a little bit.

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
I'll start tonight.

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,160
Say hello to Techmaster Loki, everybody.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Hello.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Hi.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,840
Welcome back as the case may be.

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,680
Yeah, thanks.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,080
So be here and not where I was.

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Yes.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,880
All I told the listeners was that you were in the ER, but I see you're up.

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
You're smiling.

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,600
You even got DuckTales playing behind you.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,920
So everything seems like it's all good, right?

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,280
Yeah, it's all right.

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,840
I mean, considering.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,080
So yeah, so last weekend I had like, it felt like a sore muscle, but it wasn't going away.

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,640
And I thought it was my appendix.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,760
And so I went into the ER and you know, the ER is super slow.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,560
So we did all that.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,760
It ended up not being my appendix instead.

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,640
It is a wonderful kidney stone, the gift of 2022.

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,440
So yeah, that that's fun.

37
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
All right.

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,520
Well, let me also introduce Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,120
We held down the fort last week with a no LR.

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,680
So there was no podcast because Dark Sakura and I kind of did a chatty like screw around.

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
We didn't really talk about games.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,240
We talked about whatever we wanted.

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,000
However, we were hypothesizing what's wrong with Loki before I got the text message from

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,640
you Loki, like halfway through.

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,240
But in the beginning we were hypothesizing what's wrong with Loki and a high five Dark

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Sakura.

47
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,880
I think we had landed on kidney stone.

48
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,520
So I think I, I, I, my, my exact phrase was, I hope that's what it is out of all the things

49
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
that could be.

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Yes.

51
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Yeah.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,400
I think, I think it was like that or appendix would be the like easiest to like the most

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
routine one.

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Neither are fun.

55
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Yeah.

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Neither are neither are fun.

57
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Don't get me wrong.

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,520
And I'm sure Loki can attest was not fun, but, uh, you know, the appendix actually does

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
serve a purpose.

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
I see.

61
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,780
I always thought it didn't like, it was supposed to be something like tied to like uncooked

62
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,440
meat and our ancestors or something.

63
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:16,920
It was theorized as a, as a, um, a vestigial organ, but action, but oh, oh, yeah, I, okay.

64
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,480
It wasn't just me that lost her.

65
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
Sorry.

66
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,800
You just like an internet hiccup.

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,400
Like when is, no, I don't think it was like a stupid audio rig for some reason.

68
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,840
This is even before I put, I called loop back.

69
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,760
Oh, I thought it was like a zoom zoom call gone bad.

70
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,920
It's been doing this weird thing with my headphones.

71
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:41,040
I'll need to fuck with it, but, um, but at any rate, um, it, uh, it houses good bacteria,

72
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,480
especially after periods of gastroenteritis or any sort of digestive issue.

73
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,520
Um, and on top of that, it provides a lot of the immune function in infants.

74
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Hmm.

75
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Interesting.

76
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,800
I read the whole entire study on it and it came up recently in another conversation.

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
All right.

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,760
And dark soccer is bringing, been educating us on facts like that for the last 20 years

79
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,160
in our video game, random shit.

80
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
I do it too.

81
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,040
Uh, I like to absorb celebrity stuff, so I've got to say this at the top of the show, we'll

82
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,240
get into our kickoff topic here.

83
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,840
I watched the walk-in, the walk, the walk-ins cause, uh, someone played, was it Nick that

84
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,880
played it on his channel?

85
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,960
I was someone, someone did the, uh, the, uh, workroom walk-ins.

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
I don't want to talk about drag race.

88
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
No, no, no.

89
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,680
I want to talk about, I was just going to say, but, but I already have a favorite.

90
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Okay.

91
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,120
But we'll talk about that if we have no emails, but I want to say, I want to, um, we do have,

92
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,440
I want to mention this at the time.

93
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,160
So another thing we talked about on the no LR and you guys can go back and watch it.

94
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,800
I did, um, clip it for, um, the Twitch TV subscriber archives, but I do want to stress

95
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,720
because I don't want the podcasters to feel like they're missing out on something.

96
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
It got really off topic.

97
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,200
We were talking about like COVID and all this stuff that like has nothing to do with gaming

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,780
and there were like two headlines from last week.

99
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,000
So there was hardly anything to cover anyway.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,880
But one thing we got into is we were talking about the death of Betty white, because you

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,200
know, our listeners know that we love Betty white and kind of expected us to get into

102
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
that at some point.

103
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,600
We had to talk about it and that led to dark soccer, kind of looking at a list of, well,

104
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
who else is close?

105
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,320
Cause Betty white was 99, right?

106
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,920
And as you were going through this list of 90 year old celebrities, one of the names

107
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:29,880
you came across was Sidney Poitier and then unfortunately this last week, there we go.

108
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,200
Um, one name that, well, guess who died today?

109
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
I heard.

110
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Yeah.

111
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
This is so, this is so funny.

112
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,600
Uh, I, I got up from a pre-show nap.

113
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,640
I got up from a pre-show nap as I usually do.

114
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,280
And I walk into the kitchen and Alan goes, Oh my God, did you hear who died?

115
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,560
And I was like, honey, the first thing I do whenever I wake up from it is I check Twitter.

116
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Yes.

117
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
I know Bob Saget died.

118
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,080
Um, but that, that was certainly not on the list, uh, because he was only 65.

119
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
That's that's very young and very surprising.

120
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,880
And I think a lot of people are kind of feeling that whole, like, what, like, was he murdered

121
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,800
like on tour and yeah, no.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,300
And for the record, he was not murdered.

123
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,020
And I, I, there was a, a tweet from a verified police thing in Florida that says no foul

124
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,940
play, no drugs.

125
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:23,100
So this appears to be the man probably, I, again, I don't like overworked, overstressed,

126
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,980
overworked, bad living, a heart attack probably.

127
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Who knows?

128
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,760
I don't mean to be disrespectful by making things up, but sometimes shit happens.

129
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,160
People spontaneously combust.

130
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,820
It just, things happen.

131
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,380
Um, so yeah, and a lot of people are saying he tweeted last night.

132
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,380
Yeah.

133
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,740
It just shows every day.

134
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,540
Every day is, is a gift.

135
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,540
Anyway.

136
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,300
Um, we'll get into our kickoff topic tonight.

137
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,740
Let me go back to Loki though.

138
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,620
Loki, I'm glad you're doing better and we're all happy to have you back.

139
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,860
Um, I don't think dark soccer, I really wanted to do the first show of our 20th year without

140
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,860
you.

141
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,820
And the news last week was kind of eh, anyway, so, I mean, the biggest headline was Square

142
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:08,680
Enix and NFTs and here's enough NFT stories to, to fill a dumpster right now.

143
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,500
So we'll get into some of those stories later.

144
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,660
I'm glad you didn't get Ms. Omicron while you're sitting there in the ER.

145
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Cause that was my thought.

146
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,020
I was like, you're sitting, you're in the ER with all these coughing people probably.

147
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,620
Well, yeah, so they have at least separated, like if anybody had respiratory issues, they

148
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,060
got basically banished to the tent outside.

149
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:36,020
Um, so there was, there's, there was still like some people out there that like, um,

150
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,300
there were still some people like coughing and stuff, but I did my best to like stay

151
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,380
as far away from them as possible.

152
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,340
Um, I just didn't like being in the, in the ER in the first place.

153
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,460
Cause like nobody knows medical procedures, like give me the creeps.

154
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,820
And so I had to have an IV.

155
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,820
I did not like that.

156
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Oh yeah.

157
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,820
You don't, you don't like that.

158
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,860
They gave you that good painkillers stuff like pills and shots.

159
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
Yeah.

160
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
I don't like needles.

161
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,940
Um, IVs kind of creeping out.

162
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,580
So I had to have the, the, I don't know what you call it, like the intake or whatever.

163
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,500
Like I had to have that stuck in my arm for like hours and I was sitting in the lobby.

164
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,620
I was like, uh, and then, um, so then I had that had to have a CT scan, which is pretty

165
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,620
cool.

166
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,540
Um, those are pretty cool.

167
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,980
Those are kind of like spaces and awesome.

168
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,980
Uh, they're cool.

169
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,540
And I was having all the, the things that my pancreas and they would do the radio, the

170
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,940
ultrasound, it was ultrasound, sorry, not a cat scan ultrasound.

171
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,420
I used to say, oh, we're looking at the food baby.

172
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
Yeah.

173
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,660
So that, that was kind of cool that the, you know, that thing is like very like Stargate

174
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:45,940
E. Um, and then, uh, but most of it was just sitting and it was so boring and you know,

175
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,260
I was just people watching, you know, there is a couple like crazies that came in.

176
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:57,460
There's somebody that stepped on a nail, um, uh, testicular towards everyone was a contortion

177
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,460
or something like that.

178
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,460
And it's something like that.

179
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,460
How do you hear that stuff?

180
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,980
You're not supposed to, you're not supposed to hear what's going on with the people.

181
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
Okay.

182
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
So yeah, yeah.

183
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
It does not matter.

184
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,860
People will say, where did you go to the ER?

185
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,300
The Walmart pharmacy?

186
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,020
Like no, they seriously were discussing stuff like with patients, like just out loud, just

187
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,020
everywhere.

188
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,920
I'm like, uh, HIPAA yo, I mean, but like say their names.

189
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,080
It's not technical disclosure.

190
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,820
So it, it was, yeah, it was, it was all right, I guess, but it's super like everything took

191
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,820
a long time.

192
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,040
So I was there for like eight hours and I remember like I left there like when I left

193
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,060
the house, I'm like, Oh, this is going to take all day.

194
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,900
And then, yeah, you texted me, you were like, I'm at the ER, I'll let you know about the

195
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,900
show tonight.

196
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,880
And I'm like, you're not going to be at the fucking show tonight.

197
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm like, so I'm texting Jamie.

198
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,160
Loki's not coming tonight.

199
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Yeah.

200
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,960
It just, it took a long time to get into the CAT scan is what, what happened was, you know,

201
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
with that.

202
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,640
Um, but yeah, I'm glad it's over.

203
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,760
Um, they gave me a bunch of medications that I can't really take because I, because also

204
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,720
not only is it, am I phobic about needles, but I also can't swallow pills for some reason.

205
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:13,560
So it's like, I am just a medical marvel, um, uh, yet, but yeah, these, you can't, and

206
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,040
I tried, I did get it down once.

207
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
And then that was it.

208
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,640
But thankfully though, the, the urologist said like, no, you don't need to take that.

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,780
It's only, we'll speed up the process, but like two days or we're all out of like six

210
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
to eight weeks.

211
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,300
It's just like, really?

212
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
It's no big deal.

213
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,120
Um, so that's a relief, but did, did the process finish Loki or are we still waiting?

214
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,680
No, we're still waiting.

215
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Oh no.

216
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Ooh.

217
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
So like they, okay.

218
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,120
Like the initial measurement they said was nine millimeters, which is enormous.

219
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,760
Um, but then she said it was, it was like a, uh, grain of rice, I guess, but bigger,

220
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,440
like, so like four by seven grain of rice shape.

221
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Oh my God.

222
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,320
Did they do the sound thing to try to reduce it?

223
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,000
No, not yet.

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,320
They're waiting to see.

225
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,120
So, um, as long as it doesn't pull in ever given, they go in there sideways.

226
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
We're okay.

227
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:18,440
I was, I was telling Loki before when I had mine, they did, uh, break mine up a little

228
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
bit.

229
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,120
Um, but Dan had one and I've had one in the pain.

230
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
Isn't like that sharp pain afterwards.

231
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,560
It tends to be a little bit more dull as it's passing.

232
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,640
Yeah, it's been like, thankfully the last few days have been fine.

233
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,960
And the other days that I do feel it a little bit, like it's just uncomfortable.

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,880
Um, and I'll just take like ibuprofen or something for that.

235
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,200
And then that's fine.

236
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,120
Um, the only other thing that I don't like about it is I occasionally, although I haven't

237
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,040
for the last few days, I'll get chills without having a fever.

238
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,440
So that sucks because then my, my abdomen muscles tighten up and it hurts worse.

239
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Not a ton.

240
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,120
Like, it's just like uncomfortable.

241
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,640
I mean, that's probably, it's not like painful.

242
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,120
It's just like, this is uncomfortable.

243
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,680
It's like a sore muscle.

244
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,280
Well, take care of yourself.

245
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,480
Take care of yourself, Loki.

246
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,080
And it's good.

247
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,280
It's good to have you back.

248
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,640
So, um, yeah.

249
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,640
The good news though, is I haven't been drinking Red Bulls for the whole week.

250
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,160
So, you know, shouldn't be, yeah, there you go.

251
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,920
Maybe this'll be a, we don't know that you have to, I'd say it's a likely candidate.

252
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,000
The time to, uh, kick that habit.

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,040
Maybe I did want to mention this though, since I didn't get to have you here last week to

254
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
talk about this.

255
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,560
Um, you know, we have to go back to like two weeks ago and on December 25th, I had spent

256
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
that day with Dark Sakura.

257
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,680
And we talked a little bit about that on the show, but then the day after our last show,

258
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,240
which was the 26th, I actually got to see you, Loki.

259
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,640
And I wanted to show this to listeners because Loki gave me a little something, something

260
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,200
and I want to, and by the way, I actually have two of them because one of them is for

261
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,600
Dark Sakura because Loki was like, you'll, you'll probably see her before I do.

262
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,520
Um, and what I have, let me open my bag again.

263
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,240
I actually have an NES cartridge, a physical copy of this little indie game we've talked

264
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,560
about on this show.

265
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,200
A lot of times it's called Pixel Poops number two.

266
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
There it is.

267
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,220
The actual cartridge, actual NES cartridge.

268
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,120
And it's very legit, Loki.

269
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Congrats.

270
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
I have to confess though.

271
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,160
I haven't played it yet cause I don't have a working NES.

272
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,360
So I feel like nobody told me this was out yet.

273
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,360
I don't have, I'm not selling the physical cards yet cause I, I don't have enough of

274
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
them.

275
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,400
It's a secret advance release for special people, Dark Sakura.

276
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,200
Did you not hear me say I have two and one's for you?

277
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,040
So happy.

278
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,240
And part of the reason I need to bring you your copy is that you probably have a working

279
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
NES.

280
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
We can play it on.

281
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,680
So I want to see, I want to see it on the original hardware.

282
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,440
So I'll see if we can lend you an NES.

283
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Yeah.

284
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,720
Uh, Tiger Claw says you are holding a one of a kind prototype of an NES cartridge of

285
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
the game.

286
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Yeah, true.

287
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
I guess that is true.

288
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
So, um, that's awesome.

289
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Limited edition.

290
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,400
I'm just, I'm happy my friend made a game and I want to support it.

291
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,960
So thank you Loki for, uh, hooking me up with a cartridge.

292
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
That's great.

293
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,920
He also has your, uh, animal crossing cards too.

294
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Yes.

295
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,200
Star Cyrus animal crossing cards are in here.

296
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,080
And I think was there two magazines?

297
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,240
I forgot to look.

298
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
I think it's just one.

299
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,200
Oh, nevermind.

300
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
You get the cards.

301
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
The magazine.

302
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
All right.

303
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
But I'll show you the magazine.

304
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,640
It's, it's a copy of the cool shit magazine that Loki was featured in.

305
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
So it's pretty cool.

306
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
So awesome.

307
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Scan the article.

308
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Yeah.

309
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Oh yeah.

310
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
There you go.

311
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
All right.

312
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
Um, okay.

313
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Uh, enough.

314
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Let's get into talking about games here.

315
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,760
Uh, we're talking about the consumer electronic show here at the top.

316
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,600
Not usually a lot of gaming news that comes out of consumer electronic show, but this

317
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,880
year, pretty big teas, right?

318
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Loki.

319
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Yes.

320
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
I'm very excited.

321
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,640
This is coming at some point, but we just didn't know what the details were.

322
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,220
So that's the Sony PlayStation VR two.

323
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:14,360
They had formally announced it now, of course, no details aside from some of the specs, because

324
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:22,960
this is CES, no price, no release date availability, good luck with that.

325
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,360
But it is going to be for the PlayStation five, obviously, uh, there are some new dedicated

326
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
controllers for it.

327
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,400
They call them sense because there's two of them get it dual sense.

328
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,920
Um, so they look like your bog standard, you know, VR controller.

329
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,680
I mean, you've got the ring, you've got the kind of handheld stuff.

330
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,040
They have the face button split between the two controllers and analog six split between

331
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
the two controllers.

332
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,600
It's almost like basically having the controller split.

333
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,100
And I don't see that there's like shoulder or a trigger buttons on the top there.

334
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,440
Probably there are triggers underneath.

335
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,700
They typically have that.

336
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,400
So yeah, kind of like a PlayStation dual sense controller just split.

337
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,660
And then, um, of course, some pretty impressive specs on the actual device itself.

338
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:16,260
So it's got an OLED display with 4k resolution, uh, 2000 by 20, 40 pixels per eye, uh, refresh

339
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,520
rate up to 120 Hertz.

340
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:25,540
They're going to have 110 degree field of view and also has eye tracking, which is pretty

341
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,540
cool.

342
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
And I'm curious to see how they do.

343
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,260
Well, a lot of times with the eye tracking, they may use that for foveted rendering where

344
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,460
they basically render a higher detail where you're looking and everything else is less

345
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,460
detailed.

346
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,580
So it's a way to save on render, um, rendering processing power.

347
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:50,300
Um, don't know about a whole lot of the games that are coming out for, aside from horizon.

348
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,780
Um, what was it?

349
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,780
There's a horizon.

350
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,140
Some one of their series forbidden West zero Dawn, like a forbidden horizon game in that

351
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:05,420
universe that they showed like five seconds of it looked cool, but yeah, we barely got

352
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
a taste.

353
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
Yeah.

354
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,620
Um, and pricing don't know what the price is yet on that, but I'm expecting expensive.

355
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:19,340
Um, we got to say is until, until Dawn rush of blood too.

356
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:25,140
And I'm there, I'm telling you, can I, can I say my favorite part of this whole PlayStation

357
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,820
five VR one fucking wire.

358
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Yes.

359
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,820
Oh yeah.

360
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,380
One fucking wire.

361
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
Thank you.

362
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,500
Cause the PlayStation four is spaghetti.

363
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
It is.

364
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,460
It's a mess, but it's, you know, years old tech now.

365
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
USB headsets.

366
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,180
I mean, now they have the tracking on the, you know, it's inside out tracking.

367
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,140
So you don't have a camera that you have to have anymore.

368
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,180
And then of course, everything now can be put through USB type C. So one cord, that's

369
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,180
it.

370
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,340
Um, yeah, definitely doable.

371
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,060
So I, I'm very curious to see what else they have for it.

372
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,220
Um, I think we'll see probably up versions of a lot of existing games.

373
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,420
Like, like beat saber will have to exist on this thing has to back.

374
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,740
Backwards compatibility to like, I'd want to see, like, if they do like stuff with backwards

375
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,660
compatibility, I would hope so too.

376
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,620
But yeah, I kind of want one, even though I don't play VR stuff.

377
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,620
I do.

378
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,620
Yeah.

379
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,740
I just don't have the room for it.

380
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:33,460
I like enough VR stuff where like, and I liked PS four VR enough where it's like, okay, I

381
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,620
want to get the PS five VR.

382
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,220
I mean, I have to get a PS five first, but I still feel like this is far enough out.

383
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,340
Maybe there'll be a super bundle by this holiday who, of course, whether I can get

384
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,860
my hands on one or not is going to be anyone's business.

385
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,540
Um, but, uh, yeah, I, it's, it sounds very enticing and I'm, I'm just glad Oculus has

386
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,180
a little more competition with something with the higher specs, you know, that's a little

387
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:01,140
more, you know, of 2022 than of, you know, 2016 or whenever the PS four VR came out.

388
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,900
Um, so yeah, I, I just, I I'll definitely check it out.

389
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,660
I was pretty happy with the PlayStation four VR.

390
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,660
And I think just having, you know, better graphics, more fluid, better stuff is just

391
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,860
going to, um, be even more step up.

392
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,900
Uh, I can't wait to play some more of the workout games and all that.

393
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,320
So they said, so yeah, that horizon games, uh, horizon called the mountain and they said,

394
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,660
it's actually going to be a, a proper game, not just a port of the other, or like an experience,

395
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,100
like a lot of the early VR on PlayStation.

396
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
Yeah.

397
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,380
And then, um, you know, the other thing to mention too, is what those sense controllers

398
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,680
is they also have the haptics in there, just like the PlayStation dual sense.

399
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,700
So that'll be pretty cool too.

400
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Yeah.

401
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,540
I can't wait for things like no man's sky to support it too, even though, but the thing

402
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,500
about VR and, you know, I, I really enjoy it 20 minutes at a time.

403
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,140
Like I'm just not going to play a hours long game exclusively in VR.

404
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,140
I just, I can't handle it.

405
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,620
Um, but it's great for things in short bursts.

406
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,580
So that's why Beat Saber is so fucking good because you can play five songs, take the

407
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,940
headset off, take a break.

408
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
Okay.

409
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
Now I can play a little more and I'm fine.

410
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,580
At least that's the way it is for me.

411
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,620
So, um, yeah, so that's more than I can pretty much do.

412
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,620
I know.

413
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,620
I know.

414
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:24,120
But, well, I mean, I know you used to kind of be like, not a fan of first person stuff,

415
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,020
but you seem to have made dead by daylight work for you.

416
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,980
Is there, was there a trick there or something different or I just have to get used to it.

417
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,500
And sometimes if I'm having some vertigo issues already, then I, I can't play.

418
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,700
Ah, I see.

419
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,020
Like I had this, uh, one thing and it was when I was pretty soon off of my meds where

420
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,620
I was awake at like three in the morning.

421
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:51,580
And so I logged on to play and I had myself like a really, really good pig game, right?

422
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:58,260
In Larry's lots of turns, lots of, you know, and pigs are fast, fast character.

423
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
Yeah.

424
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,260
So I got really motion sick and actually had to step away, take my nausea medicine, come

425
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
back.

426
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,460
Well, I still got a four K, but still, so, but it was a good game.

427
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,120
So it's a similar kind of thing ish where you got to do it in short bursts, maybe depending

428
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
on if I do it.

429
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Yeah.

430
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Yeah.

431
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,740
If you do it, um, like, and it also depends on the nature of it, if it honestly, if it's

432
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,180
either too smooth or not smooth enough.

433
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,180
Yeah.

434
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,100
And that, that is going to be an interesting feature of this PlayStation five VR is that

435
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,420
it will be very smooth, right?

436
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,980
That's going to be part of the, like the refresh rates supposed to be a lot better, right?

437
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,060
So yeah, I can see where, um, that could be interesting, but I also remember you played

438
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:46,300
some VR game at gamer X or one of those, you and I were both there and it was, you were

439
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,860
like, uh, you were like, I could play that.

440
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,860
Yeah.

441
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:57,340
The game wasn't so bad, but even so, when I was done, I, my sense of depth was all off.

442
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
Yeah.

443
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340
I hear you.

444
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,660
Um, Hey, since we're kind of set all about just about everything we've had to say on

445
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,140
this topic and we're about to get into our gaming weeks, um, you kind of alluded to there,

446
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,300
the med situation.

447
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,180
And I know that kind of like you had your big study this week and everything, right?

448
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,300
So anything you want to comment on that whole thing?

449
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,420
I just congrats on getting through that.

450
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,100
I know it was a difficult period.

451
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Yeah.

452
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
Yeah.

453
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Yeah.

454
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:29,820
So basically in a nutshell, what happened is, um, I hope that didn't sound funny.

455
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,420
I'm still having some issues with my mic being recognized.

456
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,060
No, you're, you're, you're coming through.

457
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,060
Okay.

458
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
Anyway.

459
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,060
Um, so I had two types of studies.

460
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:51,500
Um, uh, I'm trying to remember the other one, the M M S L T S R T, um, it's, it's some,

461
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,860
it's some type of nap test.

462
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,860
Yeah.

463
00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:04,540
Um, but anyway, um, what, what they, it's a multiple sleep latency test at the MSLT.

464
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,540
Okay.

465
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,500
So at any rate, what happens is that they hook up all of this shit to you and it's a

466
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,780
lot of wires, lot of wires.

467
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,540
They put this putty in my hair to get it to stick to my scalp.

468
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,700
And I mean, I had them here, I had them here.

469
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,700
They were here.

470
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
They were here.

471
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,700
They were on my neck.

472
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,260
I had one right here for eye movement.

473
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,700
She's pointing everywhere around my eyes.

474
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,300
I had one on my throat for like snoring, I guess.

475
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:43,780
I had another one, um, on my jaw for sleep talking, I guess, which apparently I did mumble

476
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,260
a bit in my sleep.

477
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:53,180
Um, I had ECG monitors on electrocardiogram for those who may not be in the know, um,

478
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:59,100
they put, uh, they put monitors on my legs.

479
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,980
They put them on my arms.

480
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,180
And so that was just for the nighttime test.

481
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,620
So now me, my average bedtime is like between one and 3 AM.

482
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,620
It depends.

483
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,620
I'm just a night person.

484
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,980
I'm always more alert at night.

485
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,500
They had me go into bed like closer to nine, which is like, what am I in elementary school?

486
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
Right.

487
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,220
So, um, but I did manage to go right to sleep, which was weird for me.

488
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:34,900
Um, and then I woke up at midnight and I was wide awake and I laid wide awake.

489
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:40,820
There were no, there's a window in there, but it was kind of blacked out.

490
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:47,700
And if I had to go pee, I had to, you know, call someone in to disconnect the box that

491
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,420
all my wires were connected to.

492
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Oh, geez.

493
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:56,940
And I've got all this on, on my, uh, my Twitter and I'll find the link for, um, the, the,

494
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,700
uh, it's somewhere on my profile at dark Sakura.

495
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,460
Um, I'll find the link though for chatters.

496
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:12,580
Um, so what, um, finally the lady's like, look, if you can't, if we can't get six hours

497
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,700
of sleep out of you, then we're going to have to do this test again.

498
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,860
And the first thing I thought, oh, they go put that shit in my hair.

499
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,700
So, um, I was like, look, I brought my anti-anxiety meds.

500
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,100
I have not been taking them except when I am desperate to sleep.

501
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,820
Can I take one?

502
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:37,140
And she's like, okay, because really my, my anti-anxiety stuff is more of an anti-histamine.

503
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:43,020
And so it was basically the equivalent of taking like two Benadryl instead of one Benadryl.

504
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Right.

505
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:52,420
Um, so, um, also just to go ahead and, and say this, there are other kinds of sleep tests

506
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,180
that you can take home, but this one is not one of them.

507
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,700
It's not like a basic sleep apnea test.

508
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
Right.

509
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,340
Oh, and I also had the finger monitor for, I guess, oh, two.

510
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,860
So, so you got through, you got through the night, you got through the six hours.

511
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,380
I got through the night and they woke me up at 6 AM.

512
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,940
And um, of course, now keep in mind, I haven't had any caffeine for two days now.

513
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,980
Oh, well a whole day.

514
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:22,380
And then, so the next part of it was I was doing five naps and people were like, oh,

515
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,300
you get to take a nap several times a day.

516
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
How lovely.

517
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
No.

518
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,900
It's hard to do just, or it's hard to do that many.

519
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
Yeah.

520
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,900
The thing is that for me is that during the day when I am unmedicated, I will nod off

521
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,980
at a moment's notice.

522
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,780
I am exhausted during the day.

523
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,900
I am sleepy.

524
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,860
I, I could go to sleep.

525
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:47,180
Probably right now, if you put me on the bed, I would probably take a nap and it's only

526
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,180
6.40.

527
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,940
So, um, at any rate, uh, first one I laid down and I dreamed.

528
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,580
Second one, same thing.

529
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
Third one, same thing.

530
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,620
The fourth one, I think I stayed awake through the nap time, or at least if I slept, I didn't

531
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
remember sleeping.

532
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,620
I didn't remember dreaming.

533
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,260
Fifth one, I dreamed through the whole thing, like pretty vividly, pretty quickly.

534
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,780
And each of the naps were anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes.

535
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:18,740
So in between I ate some really terrible reheated.

536
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,340
I'm going to ask you to fast forward a little bit because we're well, I just have to say

537
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,220
one thing because it was hilarious.

538
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
Yeah.

539
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,620
The French toast that they gave me, I sent a picture to Tiara and they said, it looked

540
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
like melancholy toast.

541
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,380
And that's what I'm calling it from now on depressing toes, but so you got through the

542
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,860
whole process and are you able to get back on some of the stuff you were doing before

543
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,860
and all that?

544
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,820
I'm easing back into my meds.

545
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:51,340
Just because if I can get away with taking fewer or smaller doses, I would prefer to

546
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:59,700
do that, but I already, I'll just go ahead and say what I'm on.

547
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,700
The four things that I had to quit taking was Zoloft.

548
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,500
I don't care.

549
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Normalize it.

550
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
Right?

551
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
True.

552
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,820
Zoloft and for anyone out there who has to take an SSRI, there's no shame in it.

553
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,780
If you need medication, take it.

554
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,460
I went back to taking half of my regular dose.

555
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:24,780
I am now taking 75% of my regular dose and I'm feeling pretty okay on it.

556
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,520
I take Provigil, which is something that they give to people with narcolepsy, but they also

557
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,780
give it to people with chronic fatigue syndrome, which I have been diagnosed with.

558
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,800
I'm taking less of it.

559
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,360
I'm actually needing less of it than I used to to stay awake during the day.

560
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,040
That's excellent.

561
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:48,320
I take a sleeping medication called Trazodone and I was taking four of them a night to sleep.

562
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,720
I am now getting to sleep with one of them and staying asleep.

563
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,600
The weaning has actually been good for me.

564
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,160
Then I take another one called Prazosin.

565
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,080
I am taking my same dose of that and that's something that I take for PTSD.

566
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,760
I do not mind talking about my medications because honestly, if I can normalize mental

567
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:17,040
issues and show everybody that you can be on them and be a regular, well, I'm not regular,

568
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,120
but you know what I mean?

569
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,160
A mostly regular person.

570
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,480
But anyone can be on medication, whether or not you think that they are, and it's something

571
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,020
that needs to be normalized.

572
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,620
People need to be able to talk about.

573
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,420
That is all true, but it is still your business at the end of the day.

574
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,420
And I don't care.

575
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,100
For me, if I'm in a position that I can help people normalize their treatment and normalize

576
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,380
dealing with mental issues, I'm all for it.

577
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,980
And the thing is, is that all four of those that I was on are also used to treat narcolepsy.

578
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:55,540
They cannot see if I have narcolepsy until they take me off the stuff that treats narcolepsy.

579
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,540
I get it.

580
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,340
That's kind of the whole thing behind it.

581
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,060
And I'm still not doing any driving right now.

582
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,540
I'm not exactly safe to drive.

583
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,280
I'm still having slightly catapletic moments.

584
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm not really sure what to wish somebody that's been through your situation.

585
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,420
I don't think I can say like, gosh, I hope the test results were good.

586
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,220
I just, I hope you get answers.

587
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:24,060
I hope you get answers and it puts the puzzle together for the doctors and all that good

588
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
stuff.

589
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,500
Well, hopefully I'll get the results soon.

590
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,660
I'm off for another week.

591
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:35,460
So I did take the Wednesday night after my test, I took that off from streaming and I

592
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,180
took last night off from streaming.

593
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:45,460
But in streaming notes, I only have three more days to go till I hit the 25 out of 30

594
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,460
day thing.

595
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,620
And I'm doing a joinathon on Wednesday.

596
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,620
This Wednesday?

597
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,620
Yeah, this Wednesday.

598
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,620
How fun.

599
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,140
It's basically just going to be like a random little half-assed marathon.

600
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,940
And if people want to follow, great.

601
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
I've got some prizes.

602
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,040
If people want to subscribe, great.

603
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,100
I have prizes.

604
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,620
But mostly I just want to hang out and bullshit.

605
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,620
Sounds good.

606
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,960
What's with, why don't you, oh boy, why don't you tell us about the rest of your gaming

607
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,820
week as we're getting into the segment.

608
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,440
Tell us about the other types of games you've been playing this week.

609
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,520
I've actually been playing a lot of games.

610
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,000
First of all, I started Cyberpunk 2077 since it's on Stadia.

611
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It plays very stably.

612
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,080
The car steers like shit with a keyboard and it won't let me use a controller.

613
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
Oh, wild.

614
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,120
And I even hooked, for those who are watching, I even hooked this sucker up.

615
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,720
My Street Fighter Wii wired Xbox controller.

616
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,600
That's interesting because, you know, I remember early on when all the crazy like graphic issues

617
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,640
and bugs were happening with Cyberpunk, a lot of people were saying, hey, this is the

618
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,220
best case used for Stadia yet because Stadia is the best place to play it.

619
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,000
It's the least broken there because, you know, you're running on a relatively uber computers,

620
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,600
but it's interesting that you ran into kind of the other issue about you can't really

621
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,280
control it the way you want to.

622
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,680
Yeah, but that's still not as big of a deal to me.

623
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,960
I just lowered the steering sensitivity and it's kind of all right.

624
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,840
But yeah, the steering sensitive and there's a lot more buttons to remember.

625
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,120
I kind of had to put myself a little bit into a Mass Effect thing, but I do hate that

626
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,280
it's first person.

627
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,240
I desperately hate that it's first person.

628
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,720
And if I could find a way to make it third person, I would do it.

629
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,980
So I didn't play a whole lot of it.

630
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,520
It's got some interesting factors in.

631
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,560
It could be a good game.

632
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,800
I don't know if I'm going to stick with it.

633
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:44,120
I might actually go play Avengers next, but I've also been just sort of working my way

634
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,760
through some of my Steam games as well.

635
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,680
I had this game called Demons Tilt.

636
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,120
That's a pinball game, right?

637
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
It is a pinball game.

638
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,040
It is a spiritual successor to the Crush series.

639
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,080
So Alien Crush, Devil's Crush, and Jockey Crush.

640
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,840
Oh, I didn't know those were related.

641
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,000
That's cool.

642
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,220
It's a spiritual.

643
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:13,360
I don't think it's by the same people, but it's definitely in that style.

644
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,640
It feels like playing Devil's Crush or Alien Crush or any of them.

645
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,040
It's a lot of fun.

646
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:26,160
I've got a VOD of it on my channel from playing it, and I think that's actually going to become

647
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:34,060
just like a regular casual thing for me to play on a stream, because like I said a few

648
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:39,760
weeks ago, when my work schedule changes, my streaming schedule changes, and I'm going

649
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,960
to try to do something that's a little bit more sustainable to get people in at different

650
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
times.

651
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,960
Okay, cool.

652
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah, I might even, except for my post-OLR stream, I might be going like at four o'clock.

653
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Oh, wow.

654
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Okay.

655
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah.

656
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,360
Because then my East Coast buddies can hang out with me.

657
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,380
But I've also still been playing a lot of Dead by Daylight.

658
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,380
I got...

659
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,380
Okay, okay, okay.

660
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,380
Dead by Daylight talk.

661
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,380
Quickly.

662
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,640
Okay.

663
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,040
You know who my worst character is?

664
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,360
Everybody's worst character, practically, Nurse.

665
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,360
Nurse, yeah.

666
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:22,220
I played my very fifth ever game of Nurse, and I had gone through and just put everybody

667
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,800
on their default perks just so that it would force me to try to learn them in ADEPT.

668
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,160
And I was like, oh, I'm bored, let's just play Nurse, which is I think on my VOD of

669
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,840
me saying that.

670
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:39,840
Well, either I had infants or I had meme people, although all but one of them were

671
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,520
in Nash levels.

672
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,880
I got my first 5K as Nurse and ADEPTed.

673
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Wow, congrats.

674
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
Hey, nice.

675
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
Good way to do it.

676
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
I'll take it.

677
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
I'll take it.

678
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Yeah, nice.

679
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,240
That means I never have to try this shit on Sally again.

680
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,440
And I also got ADEPT tag.

681
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Oh, wow.

682
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
Congrats.

683
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,080
ADEPT tag is actually easier than I thought it would be.

684
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,640
Her perks are pretty strong compared to the base kit for others.

685
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,880
I'm not looking forward to ADEPTing Plague.

686
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Yeah, yeah.

687
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Oh, congrats.

688
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,400
Honestly, I don't like Pig's perks.

689
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
I like playing her.

690
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,400
I hate her perks.

691
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
All right.

692
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
But yeah, but that's it.

693
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
All right.

694
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,600
That's a little diversite in your gaming week there with pinball and cyberpunks.

695
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Cool.

696
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Cool.

697
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,160
And of course I played Fantasian.

698
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
Oh, right.

699
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
Right.

700
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Right.

701
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,360
Ricky, how was your gaming week?

702
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,280
I think you're muted or I'm not hearing you.

703
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Oh, there we go.

704
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
So sorry about that.

705
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,620
Couldn't remember if I was muted or not.

706
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,800
So this week I've been playing Minecraft.

707
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,240
I know it's a shock.

708
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:53,980
I've been very busy on the server and doing server admin stuff, mainly server admin stuff

709
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,080
lately because I'm running the server.

710
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:05,080
So today we finally got our server converted over the paper MC, which made it much better.

711
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,560
We've been having like lag issues, like all sorts of crazy like issues from like literally

712
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,680
nothing that should be causing like we have very few players on where have all the optimizations

713
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,640
we could possibly put on the server in there.

714
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:26,000
And it was just not doing the thing like it's ridiculous.

715
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,520
So switching the paper just magically made everything work just fine, which is fantastic.

716
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,560
And that's how kind of we ran the server last season with Collision MC and stuff like that

717
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,360
and how they're doing it this year.

718
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,620
So I just said bite the bullet and take, you know, put that in there.

719
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,160
I don't know why we were on Fabric in the beginning in the first place, I think is because

720
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,860
somebody wanted to run their personally developed mod packs in there.

721
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,440
And now that player isn't playing on the server.

722
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,660
So he made a bunch of recommendations that we followed and they were bad recommendations.

723
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,220
So once they started ignoring the recommendations, then everything started working.

724
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,200
So yeah, we finally got that done.

725
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,800
And I did a big build for like a harbor and stuff.

726
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,900
I think last week I put out an episode and I should be doing a new one here pretty soon.

727
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,940
So it's been a lot of fun.

728
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
Nice.

729
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
All right.

730
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,020
Anything else amongst your E.R. adventures and all that?

731
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,020
Just mostly Minecraft?

732
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,080
No, just to explain the DuckTales in the background.

733
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:39,620
So that is because I convinced my youngest son to watch DuckTales and now he's hooked.

734
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
He's hooked on the new series.

735
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,620
Oh, how funny.

736
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,940
But now he watched, he binge watched all three seasons of the new series all this week.

737
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:51,440
And then he started the old series now.

738
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,140
So I just thought that was funny.

739
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
Oh, cool.

740
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,680
You got to make him play the game that DuckTales remastered was pretty good.

741
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,940
I know that I do need the I need to buy that for him.

742
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,940
Yeah.

743
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,940
He wants it.

744
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,020
Didn't it get delisted for a hot minute?

745
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,020
I think it might be back.

746
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,020
I think it like came back.

747
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:10,060
I don't have it like it's probably like a Disney Afternoon pack or something like that.

748
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,940
Don't they have like there was a Disney thing, but that was a different set of games.

749
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:18,140
That was like the Rescue Rangers and those those games that they put in that pack.

750
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,940
It might have had DuckTales 2 in there.

751
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,940
But yeah.

752
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,940
All right.

753
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,940
I'll take it.

754
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,580
Dartasuya in chat says it did.

755
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,580
Yeah.

756
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,580
But I think it came back.

757
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,580
I don't know.

758
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
Anyway, I don't think I ever shouted out the chat room.

759
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,580
Hi, chat.

760
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,580
Sorry, guys.

761
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,580
We had a lot to catch up on.

762
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,940
Who and I noticed SJ100Matt says gaming week.

763
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,340
A lot of things at MAGFest, mostly pinball.

764
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,340
Yeah.

765
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,340
MAGFest was this weekend.

766
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,700
And boy, I bet it was I bet it was a little strange with everything going on in the world.

767
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,540
But Dragon Con was weird, too.

768
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,020
I was very happy to see all the pictures and things I'm seeing.

769
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,700
Everybody's taking precautions.

770
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,660
So good for y'all.

771
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,660
Let's see.

772
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,880
Oh, Bobby does confirm it came back seven months later.

773
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
That's good.

774
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,460
Bobby Blackwolf also bringing up the Rush pinball table, which he went into great detail

775
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,540
about on his show.

776
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,880
And I know like Rush is like his favorite band.

777
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,840
So I am not surprised at all to hear that he went all in on that table.

778
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,540
But Darsakha, I know you're kind of the pinball queen here at OLR.

779
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,700
Did you see on that Rush pinball table or and are you like, oh, that looks good?

780
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,860
Or you just kind of like, no more space?

781
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,860
You're muted.

782
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,460
Y'all check your mutes.

783
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:28,980
I would, in a heartbeat, get rid of ACDC and Guns N' Roses for Rush.

784
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,420
OK.

785
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,700
And Dan just might come home to find them gone.

786
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,780
That Guns N' Roses table is pretty nice, though, even if it is old axle.

787
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,780
It's not.

788
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,780
No, no, no.

789
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,780
I don't have the old Guns N' Roses.

790
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,220
No, I was going to see Jack Guns N' Roses.

791
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,220
No, I know.

792
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,020
I was going to say a lot of people might be thinking of that older table and it isn't

793
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,560
it is the I used to have one.

794
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,420
But with with old axle, that's my point.

795
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,480
It's the thing you see in the video is dad bought axle.

796
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Yeah.

797
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,000
No, I the Jersey Jack Guns N' Roses is pretty fun.

798
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,480
I mean, I really am a big fan of the Jersey Jack tables.

799
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,840
But man.

800
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:12,520
Like I would play like the ACDC table, I play a couple of songs on that one just because

801
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,520
they're the ones I like.

802
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,040
Aerosmith table.

803
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,080
I played like nothing but sweet emotion on that one.

804
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,720
I'll play this, you know, some of the different Guns N' Roses one, because I mean, I was in

805
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,360
middle school when at the height of Guns N' Roses, you know, an appetite for destruction

806
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
came out.

807
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,720
It's I just was it's interesting.

808
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,560
You named those two tables is one you're willing to sacrifice, but not Megadeth.

809
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,760
I don't have Megadeth.

810
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
I thought you did.

811
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
What was the other machine I'm thinking of?

812
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,880
Do we have Megadeth?

813
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,640
I think you do not even know.

814
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
I don't know.

815
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,240
Go out in your garage and look, I'm pretty sure there was a Megadeth out there.

816
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,880
Well if we had Megadeth that shit can go.

817
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,040
Because they only did two good songs.

818
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,960
I can't believe she doesn't even fucking know what machine she has.

819
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,160
They rotated it out so fast.

820
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
I love it.

821
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,600
No, we might be borrowing that one.

822
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Oh, I think you know what?

823
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,160
And I think Dan was saying something about that.

824
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,760
I don't think I think it is you guys are housing it.

825
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,200
Now I have sweating bullets stuck in my head.

826
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,020
Where's my ABBA pinball table?

827
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,220
That's my, that's my, so, so Bob, Bobby was talking about like, you know, you have your

828
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,500
like whatever it is, Holy grail pinball table and like the one thing that's going to make

829
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,300
you go, well, I guess I'm buying a pinball table.

830
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,060
And for him, it was rush for me.

831
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
It's ABBA.

832
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,740
So let's, let's all Mandalorian, but I like that one.

833
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,740
Yeah.

834
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,740
All right.

835
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,740
Anyway.

836
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,620
Well, the thing is I have to see who did the, um, the design behind this one.

837
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,740
Is it a Steve Ritchie?

838
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,260
Uh, this new rush table.

839
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,260
Yeah.

840
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,860
No, Bobby said it on his show and it was somebody who did, um, other tables.

841
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,860
He went into some of the, uh, John Borg.

842
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,860
That was it.

843
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
Oh, okay.

844
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,860
Cool.

845
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,860
Cool.

846
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,860
Cool.

847
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,860
Cool.

848
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,860
Cool.

849
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,860
Yeah.

850
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,860
Um, honestly, the only thing that would make this table even better is if it was a Papa

851
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,860
Duke design.

852
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,860
Hmm.

853
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,860
All right.

854
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,460
Then again, Papa Duke did theater and world cup and Arabian nights.

855
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,220
Oh, those are, yeah, those are classics.

856
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,060
Those are like three of my favorite tables right there.

857
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
All right.

858
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,060
Yeah.

859
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,060
Let me get into my given week.

860
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,020
Um, because I actually played a little more than final fantasy 14 this week and dead by

861
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,020
daylight.

862
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,020
I played some other stuff as well.

863
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,020
Um, and a lot of that was thanks to trying to be good about streaming every day this

864
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,020
week.

865
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,540
So I played, um, final fantasy for pixel remaster.

866
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,020
Um, and I, I decided to just grab that.

867
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,100
I was going to say on the steam sale, but I don't think it was actually on steam sale.

868
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,300
I just grabbed it.

869
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,700
Um, because you know what, if I'm going to double dip on any final fantasy, I'm going

870
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,020
to do it with four.

871
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,700
Um, and I say double dip because I'm still holding out hope that they're just going to

872
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,460
put out the pixel remasters again on console.

873
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,420
Um, I really hope they do.

874
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,660
They've got to change the font.

875
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,180
If they do it, the font doesn't annoy me as much as I thought it would, but the more I

876
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,500
thought about it, the more I realized, well, if you're playing on a tablet or phone, that's

877
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,940
right in front of your face.

878
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,500
And if you're playing on a computer screen on steam, that's right in front of your face.

879
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,180
And so the font isn't annoying, but on a television, that's going to be very annoying.

880
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,900
They might be able to get away with it on switch because you can play a switch in handheld

881
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,900
mode.

882
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,820
Um, I'm hoping there's going to be some sort of pixel remaster deluxe that allows you

883
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,660
to change the fonts and maybe has some other extras in it.

884
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,980
Cause the, the, um, extras that come with pixel remaster are pretty light.

885
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,300
You get a variety of artwork and like a jukebox, very standard stuff, uh, for a game.

886
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,360
Um, maybe you can get the bonus dungeon back in there from the Game Boy advanced version

887
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,360
or something.

888
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
That would be really cool.

889
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:35,780
Um, so, um, uh, yeah, um, I was enjoying my time with it.

890
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,100
The thing that surprised me is that the translation is new.

891
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,460
I was like, is this the DS translation?

892
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,020
I just don't remember it very well.

893
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,820
Um, but I did some research on Reddit and it turns out they actually did a new translation

894
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,060
for, um, Final Fantasy three remaster and four remaster.

895
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,100
For whatever reason, they did not recycle the DS ones.

896
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,380
I don't know if that was a space concern or what.

897
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:01,660
So they actually did do new, uh, um, translations and it, it really does change things of the

898
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:06,600
story that you might remember from Final Fantasy two growing up with that as a kid.

899
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,400
Because of course, and I think we all know this now, those games were not great translations

900
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,840
because they had to cut many corners to get that game to fit.

901
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,320
And they did things and took shortcuts that I don't think Square would do today in retrospect

902
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,220
and how big the Final Fantasy franchise got here after all.

903
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,920
Um, so it is nice to play those games in more of a context, uh, they were meant to be played.

904
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,920
So, um, yeah, I'm enjoying the pixel remaster outside of the font.

905
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,820
Uh, and I even got the scene for you, Spoony Bard.

906
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,080
I'm happy to report it is still intact in that whole scene.

907
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
People would riot in the streets.

908
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,500
Yeah, people, they have to keep that the same, even if you do a new translation, um, also

909
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,660
a new to me game.

910
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,560
I played a game called Death's Door, which came out in the last year and is an indie

911
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,560
favorite.

912
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,560
A lot of people were really enjoying.

913
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,040
I took requests on Twitter.

914
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,240
I was like, Hey, what game should I stream?

915
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,640
Steam sales going on right now.

916
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,640
Convince me.

917
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,480
And, uh, Mike Deff said, get this game.

918
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,920
And so I was like, all right, I will.

919
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Uh, and it's cute.

920
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
I'm glad I picked it up.

921
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,000
It's um, I want to say it's kind of like Zelda-y, but kind of like with, um, I don't want to

922
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,520
say a roguelike element to it.

923
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,080
It feels like it, even though the game actually isn't roguelike and nothing is like randomized

924
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
in that regard.

925
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,640
Kind of has that sort of feel to it, uh, kind of like puzzle-y type of thing.

926
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,760
Um, and, uh, it's a, it's a very unique art style, uh, which I think kind of draws a lot

927
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,840
of people in as well.

928
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,120
So I've been enjoying my time with that.

929
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,360
It's kind of, it's one of those, like, you have to repeat something three or four times

930
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,960
until you're like, Oh, that's the pattern.

931
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,160
And then you like get it.

932
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,480
So, uh, it's definitely one of those types of games, uh, learning it.

933
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,480
So I had a good time with that.

934
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,640
Um, so I'll probably stream that again for another day next week.

935
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,440
Uh, and then I played a little bit of No Man's Sky, went back to an old favorite because

936
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,880
Expedition 4 started this last week and, uh, I started the expedition on stream.

937
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,400
Um, I only played a little bit off stream and what I meant to do off stream was not

938
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,680
what I finished off stream.

939
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,680
And I'll talk a little bit about that, uh, tomorrow, Monday, when I stream No Man's Sky

940
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,320
again after work.

941
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,580
I'm very excited to get back in on that and I'll tell you about the interesting stuff

942
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,740
that's happened.

943
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:17,160
Long story short, um, user bases are really allowing people to cheese some of the mechanics.

944
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,620
And Alan, who also streams No Man's Sky sometimes, he has already done with the expedition.

945
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,100
He didn't stream any of it.

946
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,780
He finished it in like four hours.

947
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:30,640
He said that was the fastest one of all four, um, because A, he knew what he was doing better

948
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,580
than any of the three times that he'd done it before.

949
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,480
And B, the user bases made it simple.

950
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,160
There was a user base called Get Eggs Here.

951
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,860
There was a user base called, uh, Six Bones Here.

952
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:46,580
And like the user bases that people are making are just telling people like, hey, come here

953
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,060
for the easy grind stuff.

954
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,580
Um, which is, and even if you're not in multiplayer mode, you can still see the bases that other

955
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,820
people make.

956
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,280
And for those of you that think that's a cheesy way to do it, hey, it's your choice to go

957
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,740
or not go to the user made bases.

958
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,260
So there is that.

959
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:05,860
Uh, Mike Defton Chat talking about Death's Door saying, it's Zelda in terms of exploration

960
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,420
and puzzles.

961
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,420
Combat is fail and learn.

962
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,500
Quest Buster says, I got my wormy head in No Man's Sky.

963
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,380
It took me around seven or eight hours blind to finish the expedition.

964
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,660
I used one of those bases for the eggs.

965
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,480
I guess I'll go ahead and say here, me too.

966
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,300
That is the thing I got finished off stream.

967
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:28,120
I wasn't expecting to because somebody made a base called Egg Farm and I was like, how

968
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,720
do you farm those eggs?

969
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,780
And uh, for those that don't know the game so well, there are these alien eggs and usually

970
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,180
when you, when you farm them by attacking them, you have to pick them up right away

971
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:43,800
or they'll disintegrate and then a swarm of really nasty aliens comes out to attack you.

972
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,080
It's like immediately going to like a four star rating in Grand Theft Auto.

973
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,080
It's really nasty.

974
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,280
Well, what somebody did at this base, they found one of those outlets and they built

975
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,840
a wall around the entire base and put the eggs inside that wall.

976
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:04,200
So it's like two walls basically like, like Tron like bikes in tandem going around the

977
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,200
base.

978
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,720
Um, and what they did is that, so when you pick up the eggs, the things spawn, they don't,

979
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,560
they figured out this cause they never spawn on top of you.

980
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,560
They always spawn a little ways away and they, they're too stupid to get through walls.

981
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,840
So you pick up the eggs, the aliens can't get through the walls.

982
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,760
In about a minute they dissipate and you go back to your ship.

983
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,760
Easy peasy.

984
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,920
So that was, that was very much the sound of that.

985
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,920
Yeah.

986
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,920
Right.

987
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,760
So it's make it, making the grinds pretty easy.

988
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,200
So we'll finish that on my Twitch tomorrow.

989
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:40,760
Uh, I actually logged, I stopped my game off stream at that base so I could show it tomorrow

990
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,760
on stream.

991
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,160
So if you want the coordinates for whatever reason and all that, uh, it is in that same

992
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,160
galaxy.

993
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,880
Um, what was I calling that one?

994
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,920
It had the planet called like Bonesville that had all the, somebody named the planet with

995
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,360
all the ancient bones, Bonesville.

996
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,400
So he knew where to go and it was on another planet in that same galaxy, which I think

997
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,120
I was calling like, uh, what the, what was it?

998
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,120
Like shucks or something like that.

999
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,120
I don't know.

1000
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,120
S S S C something.

1001
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,960
So, um, yeah, so we'll play that, uh, again tomorrow on my Twitch over at Rob Roberts.

1002
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,960
Okay.

1003
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,280
Um, we have some gaming news to talk about.

1004
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,520
There's been a few things that have happened this week among CES and other stuff.

1005
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,240
Now that we're getting back into the routine and I hope all of you that went back to work

1006
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,960
this week had a great time.

1007
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,360
Well, I mean, I know work isn't always a great time, but I hope you hope you had a good restful

1008
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,440
holiday that made getting through this week easy.

1009
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,360
And now, uh, some of the video game companies are getting back to work.

1010
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,480
So we are getting a little more news and we're going to start with Loki's headline.

1011
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,480
Yeah.

1012
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:49,320
So, um, Jeff Ross, who was, um, at one time, I think with a sucker punch productions, um,

1013
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,520
or I'm sorry, uh, Ben's studio.

1014
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:58,760
So Jeff Ross, they, they were the ones that did like days gone and resistance.

1015
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:07,600
And, um, so apparently days gone, didn't perform as well as Sony had wanted it to.

1016
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:16,640
So they sold, I guess, over 8 million copies, but because, um, it wasn't enough that they

1017
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,840
basically canned a sequel to the game.

1018
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:26,320
And I don't understand how they can be disappointed with like over 8 million copies being sold

1019
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,720
and it's still more to this day.

1020
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:37,160
Um, maybe cause of the review scores, it wasn't as, you know, well-reviewed, um, but with

1021
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,040
that though, there's, you know, they're still pitching other ideas.

1022
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:49,840
So the studio is looking to maybe even go back to, um, an open world resistance game,

1023
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,880
which I am all for.

1024
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,880
I love to resist.

1025
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,520
Yeah, that is a great series.

1026
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:05,560
It was like, um, it was like, it was actually, it was funny cause it reminded me of, oh wow.

1027
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,280
That was, oh, okay.

1028
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,280
So, okay.

1029
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,600
And then my internet just went, uh, took a big hit there.

1030
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,160
So as we're broadcasting live, there must've been a huge hiccup on Comcast and because

1031
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:22,840
Loki dropped and my thing just went to a red box and then immediately came back.

1032
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,780
So we probably lost a few frames on Twitch.

1033
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,400
The podcast will sound normal cause it comes from a localized recording, but I just have

1034
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,800
to buy a little more time while Loki reconnects here.

1035
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,300
That was a very strange, connected.

1036
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,300
You are here.

1037
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,300
Yeah.

1038
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,300
We just don't see you yet, but we hear you.

1039
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,300
That's good enough.

1040
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,980
Um, so you were talking about, uh, the resistance open world.

1041
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,980
Yeah.

1042
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,620
So, um, yeah, I'm all for that.

1043
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,620
You know, the resistance was such a really fun game.

1044
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,620
The first one, at least I'm second, I don't remember if I liked it as much, but the first

1045
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,980
one I really enjoyed.

1046
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:58,260
Um, this is coming back from like when I kind of liked it, you know, call of duty two and,

1047
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,780
um, even like, uh, like the original modern warfare games and stuff like that were pretty

1048
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,260
fun, but like, it was just a really fun kind of mix.

1049
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:10,980
So like a world war two shooter with like this alien halo, almost elements to it.

1050
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,980
And I really enjoyed it.

1051
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,060
So yeah, I would love for them to bring that back.

1052
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,900
It's more so, you know, than days gone.

1053
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,300
I never played days gone and yeah, the zombies are kind of overdone.

1054
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:26,560
You know, I can't be helped, but reminded of that story about how tomb Raider apparently

1055
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,380
undersold and everybody was sitting here going what?

1056
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:33,440
But I mean, that was evil cause like tomb Raider, I still feel like probably that game

1057
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,840
did better than days gone, but I still feel like a lot of people grab days gone.

1058
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,700
Do you think maybe Sony shot it in the foot by giving it away too early on like PlayStation

1059
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,480
plus and that sort of thing?

1060
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,040
I don't think they even shot it in the foot.

1061
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,760
Like if they're saying they sold 8 million copies of it, like true, like how many copies

1062
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,320
of this game did you want to sell?

1063
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,880
Like, I don't know.

1064
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,520
And then it's on a PC now.

1065
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:03,400
Um, so I mean, yeah, who knows how much sold like 8 million copies.

1066
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:09,000
And they're saying, you know, that's a huge success, but like, I don't know, 8 million

1067
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,520
copies in less than two years.

1068
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,520
Like it could be about the budgets.

1069
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,240
I don't know.

1070
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:20,540
Maybe I don't know what the budget of the game was, but like, I mean, geez, like what

1071
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,320
are your expectations?

1072
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,440
Make those a little bit more realistic, please.

1073
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,440
I know.

1074
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,440
All right.

1075
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,080
This game that you're developing has got to sell a hundred million copies to 10 million

1076
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,080
people.

1077
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,640
Yeah.

1078
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:38,000
Um, I'm going to apologize to the live folks because I see that we are kind of going up

1079
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and down with the frames and I don't know what's causing it.

1080
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,600
There's no inclement weather or anything going on.

1081
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:50,560
So this is just some weird and plus, Loki, you, you lost your internet hiccup too, right?

1082
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,000
So this must be some wider like west coast issue.

1083
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,240
I'm still like connected with everything.

1084
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,600
So like it just, my camera like blinked and I was about it.

1085
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,600
So I don't know.

1086
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,600
Something weird is going on you guys.

1087
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,120
I'm very sorry.

1088
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,480
We're going to push through for the sake of the podcast folks.

1089
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,120
Um, but thank you for sticking with us here live on Twitch.

1090
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,720
I don't think I said this yet, but we do tape live of course, every Sunday night at nine

1091
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,160
o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG network,

1092
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,680
twitch.tv slash a V O G network, the voice of geeks network and where we've been for

1093
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,080
now our 10th year at VOG network.

1094
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,040
I mean, technically the birthday's in like April, but, um, you know, we're celebrating

1095
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,680
20 years a little early at OLR.

1096
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,840
So why not celebrate 10 a little early at VOG?

1097
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,160
So one of the things I liked about resistance for some of the weapons that they had in there,

1098
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,920
they had, this was like even before like Titanfall had this where you had bullets basically that

1099
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,200
you could tag like an enemy with, and then you can shoot them and they go around walls

1100
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,480
and stuff and they'd follow kind of home in on it, which is pretty awesome.

1101
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,880
Plus it had a really cool campaign where you unlock a bunch of weapons throughout the campaign

1102
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,800
and then you play like almost like a new game plus, and then there's brand new weapons you

1103
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,640
unlock as well.

1104
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,640
So that's pretty awesome.

1105
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,640
That's pretty cool.

1106
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,640
All right.

1107
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,520
Um, yeah, we just dropped down to zero.

1108
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,160
Like we're not actually putting anything out on Twitch right now, but you guys are still

1109
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,160
here.

1110
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,480
So I know the internet was flickering for me.

1111
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,480
Was it interesting?

1112
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,160
Cause I was like, I know it's not the internet because, um, uh, you guys are still here.

1113
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,160
So it's weird.

1114
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,160
All right.

1115
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,600
I'm going to try to push through and talk about this next story.

1116
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,280
Um, and just hope the internet kind of recovers there.

1117
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,160
If I have to, I'll stop the show and fire up, um, a different Twitch server to see if

1118
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,440
it's on Twitch's end.

1119
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,080
But for now, let me get into this next story.

1120
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,480
So, um, of course, consumer electronics show happened this week and arcade one up showed

1121
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,200
up and arcade one up was showing off some new cabinets, including a brand new pack mania

1122
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,200
cabinet.

1123
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,480
Um, I think pack mania has been in before.

1124
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,040
This pack mania cabinet though, it's actually a little bit of like a best of Namco collection.

1125
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,840
When I tell you what's in this cabinet, it's Dig Dug, Dig Dug 2, Galaga, Galaga ADA, Galaxian

1126
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,560
Mappy, pack and pal, pack land, pack man, pack man plus, pack mania, rolling thunder,

1127
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,620
rompers and super pack man.

1128
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,200
So what's interesting about these arcade one up machines and for a lot of people that have

1129
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,640
been bitching this whole time, well, they only put like four games in those machines

1130
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,280
and that sort of thing.

1131
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:22,720
Um, I feel like this is sort of like, oh, well now that they've kind of put out all

1132
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,520
those games, now they're starting to do more of these super machines.

1133
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,280
So again, this really feels like a, like a super Namco collection.

1134
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,200
So dark soccer, how do you feel hearing about that?

1135
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
Cool.

1136
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Yeah.

1137
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,280
You, are you, are you kind of interested in it?

1138
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,280
I'm sorry.

1139
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,600
Are you, are you kind of interested in that machine?

1140
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,600
Kinda.

1141
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,600
Yeah.

1142
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,600
I don't blame you.

1143
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,600
I'm sorry.

1144
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,600
You're breaking up really badly.

1145
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,600
Okay.

1146
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,600
Then that's so weird.

1147
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,600
Did you see the other ones too?

1148
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:54,520
The other, uh, the Midway and uh, Midway and the Azhar Academy.

1149
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,520
Oh yeah.

1150
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,520
Yeah, no, I was going to get, I was going to get there.

1151
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,160
There's a mortal combat one as well, which is just a Midway collection.

1152
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,160
I want this machine to be honest.

1153
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,800
I want the Tron one more, but I really liked this one.

1154
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,680
This one has bubbles, defender, gauntlet, joust, klax, mortal combat one, two and three,

1155
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:15,620
paper boy, rampage, tapper, tuben, ultimate mortal combat three and wizard of war.

1156
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,400
That's a really solid collection.

1157
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,520
And then there's a centipede cabinet, which is basically an Atari collection with a car

1158
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:29,440
asteroids, asteroids, deluxe, centipede, crystal castles, gravatar, a liberator, lunar lander,

1159
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,800
major havoc, millipede, missile command, space dual, super breakout and tempest.

1160
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:41,720
Now on top of all this, we have the very first pro machine that is coming out.

1161
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,520
This pro machine is a killer instinct cabinet.

1162
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:50,880
It is a clone of the first killer instinct cabinet, but it is a 19 inch screen and it

1163
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,900
has, it's basically the size of an actual arcade cabinet.

1164
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,000
You know how arcade one up machines, they're kind of a little bit smaller, even though

1165
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,240
you still play them standing up and they kind of, they kind of feel right.

1166
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,960
They still, they, but this is going to be the actual size of a real cabinet.

1167
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,680
And for that reason, you can expect it's probably going to be closer to a thousand dollars,

1168
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,440
but still a pretty nice machine there.

1169
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,960
And I'm sure Dark Sakura is probably going to be interested in that.

1170
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,960
So all right.

1171
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,960
Yeah.

1172
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,000
I love that game.

1173
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,640
The internet issues are continuing.

1174
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,400
So before we get to Dark Sakura's next story, we're going to do a little bit of a break

1175
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,400
here.

1176
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,680
I'm going to do the whole, turn it off and on again, just to make sure it's not my internet

1177
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,040
and we'll be right back.

1178
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,880
Please stay with us, folks.

1179
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:39,440
We'll be right back here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1180
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,800
And unfortunately that ended up being the end of the show.

1181
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,880
I had some pretty major issues with my upload speed that took a few days for the cable company

1182
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,880
to fix.

1183
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,440
Sucks when things out of your control happen, but what can you do?

1184
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,760
Appreciate those of you that turned up live and those that listened to the podcast this

1185
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,760
week.

1186
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,200
Sorry it's a late post, but the hobbled upload meant I couldn't even move the recording to

1187
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:03,280
Dropbox and sorry about the abrupt ending, but it is what it is and we'll try again next

1188
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,280
week.

1189
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,280
Until then, take care everyone.

1190
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:11,360
