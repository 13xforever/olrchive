00:00.000 --> 00:14.020
This week, I updated my Steam profile's featured screenshots to include a grab from

00:14.020 --> 00:18.880
Electronic Superjoy that had a character saying, what's Zynga's favorite TV show?

00:18.880 --> 00:19.880
Game of Clones!

00:19.880 --> 00:23.960
Today, I see that Zynga is being acquired by Take-Two.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.720
I hope the copycat Bonanza and acquisition of Sega's famed San Francisco headquarters

00:27.720 --> 00:30.100
created a lot of value for shareholders.

00:30.100 --> 00:33.160
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:33.160 --> 00:35.800
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where

00:35.800 --> 00:36.800
every gamer has a voice.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.800
Hello, my friends.

00:37.800 --> 00:47.600
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.600 --> 00:53.680
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back, and I hope we are back for a nice, long show

00:53.680 --> 00:56.860
tonight with episode number 899.

00:56.860 --> 01:03.980
For this January the 16th of 2022, our first, hopefully, real show of the year.

01:03.980 --> 01:09.140
No medical issues, no internet issues, knock on wood, no weather issues, knock on wood,

01:09.140 --> 01:10.140
knock on everything.

01:10.140 --> 01:13.360
I am here, Rob Roberts, joining you with my co-host.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.940
Say hello, as always, to the wonderful Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:16.940 --> 01:17.940
Hi.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.500
Hi, Jamie Summers.

01:19.500 --> 01:25.260
And Jamie, please join me in giving props to our voiceover dude, VX Jason XV, because

01:25.260 --> 01:28.380
he did an A-plus job tonight, I'm just saying.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.380
He does great work.

01:30.380 --> 01:31.380
He did.

01:31.380 --> 01:32.380
He does.

01:32.380 --> 01:33.380
He does.

01:33.380 --> 01:34.380
How are you doing?

01:34.380 --> 01:35.380
I'm all right.

01:35.380 --> 01:36.380
Yeah?

01:36.380 --> 01:37.380
All right.

01:37.380 --> 01:38.380
A little sinacy.

01:38.380 --> 01:39.380
Yeah, I can hear you a little sniffly.

01:39.380 --> 01:41.160
It's not the big C, though, right?

01:41.160 --> 01:42.160
I don't know.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.160
Probably not.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.160
All right.

01:44.160 --> 01:49.180
I mean, I just started feeling a little bit crappy a couple days ago, but it's okay.

01:49.180 --> 01:50.180
Okay.

01:50.180 --> 01:55.140
I'm supposed to go back to work on the 19th, but we'll see.

01:55.140 --> 01:56.140
All right.

01:56.140 --> 01:58.780
Well, I hope everything gets back to normal for you.

01:58.780 --> 01:59.780
Hey, the 19th.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.300
That's a big day for me.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.300
Oh, no, no.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.900
No, no, yeah, this is the 19th.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.220
Sorry, my days are all mixed up.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.220
It is our anniversary of the 19th.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.220
Yes.

02:08.220 --> 02:09.220
In my head, I was like, the 17th.

02:09.220 --> 02:12.220
No, wait, wait, no, the 19th.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.220
All right.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.220
Wednesday.

02:14.220 --> 02:15.220
Yes.

02:15.220 --> 02:16.220
The internet might work.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.220
My brain may not.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.220
Also, say hello.

02:18.220 --> 02:19.220
Oh, Rob.

02:19.260 --> 02:20.260
Oh, me.

02:20.260 --> 02:21.980
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:21.980 --> 02:22.980
Hello.

02:22.980 --> 02:24.780
Hi, Loki.

02:24.780 --> 02:30.260
I see you broadcasting a game play behind you because we do tape live every Sunday night

02:30.260 --> 02:34.460
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

02:34.460 --> 02:40.140
VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 9 Eastern, 6 Pacific.

02:40.140 --> 02:44.660
And I see as we are broadcasting live here, you're playing some Mario Paint behind you.

02:44.660 --> 02:45.660
Yeah.

02:46.100 --> 02:52.100
Like earlier this week, I had like a game that came up and I was like, oh, yeah, I got

02:52.100 --> 02:54.040
to do that for my background video.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.100
And then today immediately forgot what that was.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.100
So that's Mario Paint.

02:57.100 --> 03:00.560
I'm like, oh, that would be perfect.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.020
That would totally fit in with everything that we're talking about.

03:03.020 --> 03:04.980
And then it's Mario Paint.

03:04.980 --> 03:05.980
It is.

03:05.980 --> 03:09.220
I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

03:09.220 --> 03:13.920
SSU 100 Matt points out maybe part of my confusion, like the 17th being an important day.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.960
That is what would have been Betty White's 100th birthday.

03:16.960 --> 03:20.880
And SSU 100 Matt is reminding us the internet is calling for folks to donate to an animal

03:20.880 --> 03:22.640
charity in her name tomorrow.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.640
Love that idea.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
Love it.

03:24.640 --> 03:33.480
So I'm considering going to my PetSmart tomorrow and buying some bags of cat food for the kitties

03:33.480 --> 03:34.480
that they house.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.480
Oh, OK.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.480
Nice.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.480
We'll see.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.480
Nice.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.480
Nice.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.480
All right.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.840
Well, he's going there and harassing the cats.

03:42.840 --> 03:47.820
Before we get into our kickoff topic tonight, I do want to address last week's show.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.100
There's no nice way to say it.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.460
It was a disaster.

03:51.460 --> 03:53.600
It was just one of those things.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.460
It was it was an awful week.

03:55.460 --> 03:58.780
And you know, you do 900 shows as of next week.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.620
There's going to be a few stinkers in there.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.960
And it just sucks that a lot of it was out of our control.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.520
And you know, it is what it is.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.640
I apologize to the podcast folks because I didn't get the podcast up till really late

04:09.640 --> 04:10.640
in the week.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.140
My upload was still borked for several days after the show.

04:14.140 --> 04:19.060
And that's what that's what was wrong is that my upload speed was, for whatever reason,

04:19.060 --> 04:20.060
not working right.

04:20.060 --> 04:25.260
I was getting like half a megabyte upload, which to get video out on Twitch, you need

04:25.260 --> 04:28.100
like four K, five K, even like low video.

04:28.100 --> 04:32.300
You need like two K. And I wasn't even getting that for upload.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.460
So it really kind of hosed the show.

04:34.460 --> 04:37.340
And then Dark Sakura was having webcam problems.

04:37.340 --> 04:42.120
But honestly, those problems didn't really end up mattering because, uh oh, I think I

04:42.120 --> 04:45.280
jinxed it because now she's got to plug it in.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.280
I okay.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.640
I didn't have to plug in anything.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.160
I was adjusting it and turned on my lock screen.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.160
Oh, okay.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.160
All right.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.160
Because I use my iPhone as my webcam.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.280
I was like, oh, no, not again.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.280
Yeah.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.560
And I appreciate you guys in chat.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.960
Dark Tetsuya says not your fault.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.480
Pod Culture says not your fault.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.480
Shit happens.

05:01.480 --> 05:02.480
I know.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.480
I know.

05:03.620 --> 05:08.160
Continuing the theme tonight, because Bobby Black Wolf was beating up on himself earlier

05:08.160 --> 05:14.060
for things during awesome games done quick, which there's no need to be awesome games

05:14.060 --> 05:17.300
done quick was awesome games done quickly.

05:17.300 --> 05:21.700
And they raised a lot of money, which we'll talk about later in the show, of course.

05:21.700 --> 05:25.100
But now I beat myself up over issues that were out of my control and is what it is.

05:25.100 --> 05:30.820
So finally they and of course, you know, I I filed a ticket and they wanted to send a

05:30.820 --> 05:35.080
tech out here, but they didn't need to because somebody else figured out the problem.

05:35.080 --> 05:39.160
So I had to cancel the tech because the problem just magically fixed itself on like Wednesday

05:39.160 --> 05:40.400
or Thursday.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.880
So anyway, I did run a bandwidth test before the show tonight.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.640
We were able to maintain for 10 minutes.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.120
So I'm hoping all is well.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.120
It is what it is.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.680
We're just going to push through and talk about video games.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
All right.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.680
Tested mine to make sure it's good.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.680
Yes.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.880
We're all testing.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.740
So my upload is about 40 megabits.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.280
So I'm happy.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.680
Welcome to our real first show of 2022.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.440
And Loki, you're feeling good, right?

06:06.440 --> 06:07.840
Hopefully I'm fine.

06:07.840 --> 06:08.840
Good.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.860
Welcome to our first show of 2022.

06:11.860 --> 06:15.320
Let's get into, of course, talking about what better thing to talk about for our first show

06:15.320 --> 06:18.920
for 2022 than to go back and talk about 2021.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.300
But I received a tweet this week that was like, hey, Rob, you guys going to talk about

06:22.300 --> 06:23.300
your games of the year?

06:23.300 --> 06:27.420
And I was like, oh, yeah, that was a that's a thing we should probably talk about around

06:27.420 --> 06:28.420
this time.

06:28.420 --> 06:32.960
So I want to open the floor and talk about what were your favorite, what was your favorite

06:32.960 --> 06:34.840
game or your favorite games?

06:34.840 --> 06:36.780
I'm not going to be very formal about it.

06:36.780 --> 06:39.460
And I'll get into why when I get into my game.

06:39.460 --> 06:46.400
But I just want to ask you, like, what were your like game or games of the year for 2021?

06:46.400 --> 06:48.980
My game didn't come out last year.

06:48.980 --> 06:50.120
And that's OK.

06:50.120 --> 06:56.680
And I think this is a very important rule to set is that it's it's the game for you.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.380
And no, but nobody can say that's right or wrong.

06:59.380 --> 07:03.680
People can argue about critic lists all they want and like the definitive top hundred of

07:03.680 --> 07:06.080
all time because everybody's list is going to be different.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.980
So it's really like, what was it for you?

07:08.980 --> 07:12.440
So Dark Soccer, since you kind of started there and you're saying it's not something

07:12.440 --> 07:16.400
from this year, what is your game of the year or games?

07:16.400 --> 07:20.560
I am going to say it's Dead by Daylight just because I played the most of it and I've had

07:20.560 --> 07:25.140
the most fun playing it and I've met the best people playing it.

07:25.140 --> 07:30.660
So the game overall has been.

07:30.660 --> 07:38.320
Great for me, even though it makes me curse like a freaking sailor, you know, but I've

07:38.320 --> 07:47.660
had a great time playing it and the game itself is different than, you know, the.

07:47.660 --> 07:52.500
The original release of it, obviously, I mean, they've made some changes and there's graphic

07:52.500 --> 07:59.660
updates and even the mechanics in the game are different than they were, you know, on

07:59.660 --> 08:01.540
its original release.

08:01.540 --> 08:06.960
So yeah, I'm going to say say that and Fantasian.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.460
See I was I thought you'd say Fantasian.

08:09.460 --> 08:12.500
I mean, no one is surprised to hear Dead by Daylight.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
Nobody is surprised to hear that.

08:13.500 --> 08:18.740
I'm sure like I just knowing you like that game, I feel like has been transformative

08:18.740 --> 08:21.100
for your online presence.

08:21.100 --> 08:25.740
And I mean that as a compliment, like like you're you're motivated on Twitch in a way

08:25.740 --> 08:28.100
I've never seen you before.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.100
You're not.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.100
I got bullied off Twitch before.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.100
Yeah.

08:31.100 --> 08:32.100
And people are idiots.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.940
And but I'm glad you got back on the horse.

08:34.940 --> 08:43.780
And maybe we have other, you know, women, other people of color, other trans folks.

08:43.780 --> 08:46.220
I'm calling out the marginalized folks out there.

08:46.220 --> 08:51.500
I think maybe we have a lot of them to thank for, you know, putting up with a lot of the

08:51.500 --> 08:58.380
bullshit and make taking a hold of this platform and saying, we're not letting go.

08:58.380 --> 08:59.620
We're not going anywhere.

08:59.620 --> 09:02.500
Our voices are going to be heard, come together like no other.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.900
And it's transferring over to VHS.

09:04.900 --> 09:05.900
Yeah.

09:05.900 --> 09:12.700
Which, you know, I actually messaged the VHS devs because I mean, that's another one that

09:12.700 --> 09:14.100
I would love to play.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.100
It looks like a lot of fun.

09:15.100 --> 09:21.100
I've been enjoying watching my friends play it and a little bit jealous.

09:21.100 --> 09:23.940
But that one also just looks like it's super fun.

09:23.940 --> 09:25.620
The community has been really supportive.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.820
I haven't had the degree of toxicity.

09:27.820 --> 09:29.460
I haven't noticed it.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.180
Amongst some of the player base.

09:31.180 --> 09:36.380
Then again, it is, you know, it's in a beta, a closed beta.

09:36.380 --> 09:43.860
But I would even put that as like, if I had to say something that came out quote, because,

09:43.860 --> 09:46.660
you know, it was in beta at the end of the year.

09:46.660 --> 09:51.020
I'd say VHS would probably be up there in the new game category, even though I haven't

09:51.020 --> 09:52.020
played it.

09:52.020 --> 09:53.780
It looks like it's a lot of fun.

09:53.780 --> 09:54.780
Very 80s-tastic.

09:54.780 --> 09:55.780
Yeah.

09:55.780 --> 10:00.040
I've, I've, I've watched some of the streamers you and I both watch because we're always

10:00.040 --> 10:01.180
watching the same person.

10:01.180 --> 10:03.420
It seems play that game.

10:03.420 --> 10:08.700
Well, I think that some of our mutual friends have just thought it was hilarious by now

10:08.700 --> 10:11.180
that we kind of read about it.

10:11.180 --> 10:12.180
I'm sure.

10:12.180 --> 10:17.820
I get VHS yet, like the play of it, but it's, it's because I just, I need to play it until

10:17.820 --> 10:19.580
I like really understand it.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.340
It's just, yeah, whatever.

10:21.340 --> 10:26.220
The thing is, is it's, you're crafting stun weapons or kill weapons and the teens are

10:26.220 --> 10:30.220
stuck in like a teen movie with one of them turning into the monster.

10:30.220 --> 10:31.220
I love the aesthetic.

10:31.220 --> 10:32.220
I love the aesthetic.

10:32.220 --> 10:36.460
The teens have to kill the monster or the monster kills the teens.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.440
So this is a game where you fight back.

10:38.440 --> 10:43.080
And apparently the communication is definitely the key in this game.

10:43.080 --> 10:46.800
Like way much more because in Dead by Daylight, you can sort of like, if you're solo queue,

10:46.800 --> 10:50.120
you can sort of just, you know, fuck around and do your own thing and maybe still make

10:50.120 --> 10:51.880
it out of the game.

10:51.880 --> 10:57.120
But I've noticed in VHS, if there's not communication, if one falls, all fall.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.120
Yeah.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.120
Yeah.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.120
Okay.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.760
So that's kind of my take on it.

11:01.760 --> 11:09.640
But I've, I did actually reach out to the, on their Twitter to see if there were any

11:09.640 --> 11:14.720
plans for a Mac release or if it runs in Windows ARM, because I'm running Windows 11 ARM in

11:14.720 --> 11:19.080
Parallels and there's still some games that, that won't play on it.

11:19.080 --> 11:25.800
And I'm actually really irritated at the anti-cheat that Dead by Daylight uses because the anti-cheat

11:25.800 --> 11:30.560
doesn't run in an ARM environment, but Dead by Daylight does.

11:30.560 --> 11:34.880
And when I try to run the game without the anti-cheat, it tells me I'm not connected

11:34.880 --> 11:35.880
to Steam.

11:35.880 --> 11:36.880
Right.

11:36.880 --> 11:37.880
Right.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.920
So, and I haven't been able to figure any way around it so I can actually play it on

11:40.920 --> 11:48.800
Steam instead, but honestly enough, I'm still pretty happy with Stadia.

11:48.800 --> 11:53.400
There's just been, I've found, you know, a few games since I've just got really, I got

11:53.400 --> 11:56.160
a little bit bored with Dead by Daylight and started trying to stream some other stuff

11:56.160 --> 11:59.880
and Cyberpunk 2077 is actually not really to my liking.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.880
I don't like first person games.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.120
I saw you playing something really random the other night.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.120
I can't remember what it was.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.120
Demons Tilt?

12:07.120 --> 12:09.480
No, it was something else.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.480
Oh, Muse Dash.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.240
Yeah, I saw you playing Muse Dash.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.240
I love Muse Dash.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.800
Muse Dash is pretty fun and really simple, but I'm also playing it on my iPhone so I

12:17.800 --> 12:24.000
don't always want to, it's a little bit interesting to play like through Steam, but it's fun.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Don't get me wrong.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.440
I love the music in it.

12:27.440 --> 12:33.520
But I'm also, though, I'd have to say that like the best RPG that I have played in the

12:33.520 --> 12:39.200
last several years, though, I'm going to put Fantasian up on that list because the story

12:39.200 --> 12:42.920
is really good.

12:42.920 --> 12:49.040
I've made it through a lot of combat for the game really easily, but the boss battles are

12:49.040 --> 12:51.280
harder than advertised.

12:51.280 --> 12:58.800
It's definitely something that you're going to have to redo your growth path in the game.

12:58.800 --> 13:04.920
Like you can actually channel your skill points into different skills on a branching tree.

13:04.920 --> 13:10.200
And I've actually had to go in and redo entire sets of them for some of the battles in the

13:10.200 --> 13:11.600
game.

13:11.600 --> 13:17.120
Like there's one that I have to take all of, I have counter on most of the characters because

13:17.120 --> 13:22.080
typically having counter is really good, it's extra attack, but I had to turn off counter

13:22.080 --> 13:28.840
for all of this one battle because if you hit one of the little sub creatures, it causes

13:28.840 --> 13:33.840
a chain reaction to make all of them explode and then it will kill you.

13:33.840 --> 13:39.160
So you have to do this like vacuum skill that sucks them all off to the side so that you

13:39.160 --> 13:44.640
don't accidentally hit one when you hit the main baddie because some people have piercing

13:44.640 --> 13:48.960
attacks that will go through lines of characters.

13:48.960 --> 13:54.880
And the way that you can chain and pierce your attacks, it is so unique.

13:54.880 --> 14:02.560
Not to mention the backgrounds and the levels are all hand-built diorama.

14:02.560 --> 14:09.360
So there's a lot of care that went into that game and it's a care I haven't seen in a game

14:09.360 --> 14:10.480
in quite some time.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.200
So I'm pretty happy with it.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.260
You're not the first to really rave about that game.

14:15.260 --> 14:18.520
One of my other friends says that that's his favorite game of the entire year too, who

14:18.520 --> 14:19.520
plays a lot of RPGs.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.400
So I really trust his opinion.

14:21.400 --> 14:26.420
Not that I don't trust yours, but I just seeing it in multiple places when I don't think a

14:26.420 --> 14:31.520
ton of people are playing that game because it is limited to Apple Arcade right now.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.520
And I'm not sure.

14:32.520 --> 14:33.520
You can play it on your iPhone.

14:33.520 --> 14:38.400
Oh yeah, I know, but I'm not sure a lot of people are exploring that.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.100
Actually I'll just go ahead and say this right now.

14:42.100 --> 14:50.780
You can use my Apple Arcade subscription on the, uh, on the, uh, uh, OLR account.

14:50.780 --> 14:51.780
I'll get around to it eventually.

14:51.780 --> 14:53.180
My backlog is gigantic.

14:53.180 --> 14:55.180
That's just one of many games sitting in my backlog right now.

14:55.180 --> 14:58.300
This has superseded a lot of different games that I've acquired.

14:58.300 --> 14:59.300
I get it.

14:59.300 --> 15:02.420
Um, although I did buy battle of the gods.

15:02.420 --> 15:05.020
It's by the same people that do battle of the animals.

15:05.020 --> 15:06.020
Hmm.

15:06.020 --> 15:10.260
Um, you can play Jesus versus Santa Claus.

15:10.260 --> 15:19.140
It's very sacrilegious and I'm kind of, I'm kind of like, I don't believe in disrespecting

15:19.140 --> 15:27.820
faiths, but at the same time, you know, the old, uh, Southern Baptist, sorry, there's

15:27.820 --> 15:29.020
something flying around.

15:29.020 --> 15:31.980
There's the old Southern Baptist in me.

15:31.980 --> 15:39.380
That's just sort of like getting a kick at knocking, you know, all right.

15:39.420 --> 15:40.420
Sorry.

15:40.420 --> 15:41.420
Not, not knocking Midna.

15:41.420 --> 15:45.820
She just jumped down and made a noise, but, but you know what I mean?

15:45.820 --> 15:48.820
That's God telling you to watch it.

15:48.820 --> 15:52.100
Cat, stop it.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.100
All right.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.100
She's okay.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.100
Sorry.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.100
She's, she's getting into stuff.

15:56.100 --> 16:00.660
Let me, uh, let me go over to Loki and it, cause I, I actually have no idea what Loki's

16:00.660 --> 16:01.660
going to answer this with.

16:01.660 --> 16:05.780
Uh, so I'm, I'm super curious, uh, your game or games of the year.

16:05.780 --> 16:06.780
Loki.

16:06.780 --> 16:08.500
Oh, my, my games.

16:08.500 --> 16:15.100
Um, well, I didn't play that many this year, so, um, I mean, I guess if I can do like a

16:15.100 --> 16:22.460
top three or something, uh, we can do power washing SIM cause that's, that's awesome.

16:22.460 --> 16:25.900
That's, that's a pick that was going through my head too.

16:25.900 --> 16:26.900
Absolutely.

16:26.900 --> 16:32.660
So yeah, power washing simulator, uh, hotshots racing, pretty cool.

16:32.660 --> 16:33.660
Yep.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.460
Uh, that was pretty solid racing game.

16:35.460 --> 16:40.580
Um, I mean, obviously Minecraft and my game.

16:40.580 --> 16:41.580
Sure.

16:41.580 --> 16:47.260
I was, I was going to put pixel poops number two on my list, but then it was like conflict

16:47.260 --> 16:48.260
of interest.

16:48.260 --> 16:49.260
What?

16:49.260 --> 16:50.260
It's fine.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.260
Ethics.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.260
What?

16:52.260 --> 16:53.260
All right.

16:53.260 --> 16:59.340
And that's probably like the only games that I, I played this year.

16:59.340 --> 17:03.060
So that's, I mean, that's going to be it.

17:03.180 --> 17:07.740
Um, for me, um, so I have kind of like three different answers.

17:07.740 --> 17:11.900
It's not a top three, but the three different mindsets I've been in and approaching this

17:11.900 --> 17:13.020
question.

17:13.020 --> 17:16.660
And at first I was like, all right, if I'm going to just do the traditional pick, I mean,

17:16.660 --> 17:21.980
I also, I kind of feel like Loki, I haven't played a lot, a lot of games this year.

17:21.980 --> 17:27.460
That doesn't mean I, I dislike gaming or I should be unqualified from talking about video

17:27.460 --> 17:28.460
gaming.

17:28.460 --> 17:31.900
I just feel like a lot of the old standbys, a lot of the gold classics have really carried

17:31.900 --> 17:37.020
me through this year and I haven't been very adventurous exploring a lot of new titles.

17:37.020 --> 17:40.780
Um, and I think there's a lot of factors that play into that and that's just the way it

17:40.780 --> 17:41.940
is that made up my year.

17:41.940 --> 17:45.700
It doesn't make me any less of a gaming fan just because I'm playing classics.

17:45.700 --> 17:50.260
Um, but I think, you know, if I were to take this question from a traditional perspective,

17:50.260 --> 17:55.100
I'd probably say, eh, probably Forza Horizon 5, you know, it was a game I was super hyped

17:55.100 --> 17:59.700
about, loved Forza Horizon 4, Forza Horizon 5 is like more of the same and is that a bad

17:59.700 --> 18:00.700
thing?

18:00.700 --> 18:01.700
Absolutely not.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.540
There's so much to see and do in that game.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.800
It's great.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.380
But the more I kind of thought about it, like honestly, I was, I was totally prepared to

18:08.380 --> 18:14.680
come into the show tonight and give the big spiel about why I think the, the 2022 game

18:14.680 --> 18:15.680
of the year.

18:15.680 --> 18:20.140
I mean, there's, there's been a lot of not, excuse me, the 2021 game of the year that

18:20.140 --> 18:21.820
we're talking about in 2022.

18:21.820 --> 18:26.540
Um, I honestly think there's been a lot of stuff this year that's not great about gaming.

18:27.380 --> 18:32.020
Um, from the technical and logistical perspective of, I still can't go into target and get a

18:32.020 --> 18:33.420
PlayStation five.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.100
These things are still being scalped.

18:35.100 --> 18:38.580
Same thing with series X series S I guess is getting a little bit easier.

18:38.580 --> 18:43.420
I mean, you can buy those on Woot now, but you know, for the most part, the next generation

18:43.420 --> 18:46.500
of gaming is still inaccessible for a lot of people.

18:46.500 --> 18:52.520
And you put on top of that, the fact that, um, there's been a lot of bullshit in our

18:52.520 --> 18:57.560
industry that's really floated to the top, um, this year between what's going on with

18:57.560 --> 18:59.760
Activision blizzard, Ubisoft.

18:59.760 --> 19:05.520
I mean, we talked about it weeks and weeks on the show and the reckoning needed to happen.

19:05.520 --> 19:10.320
But the fact that a lot of this bullshit is still out there and exacerbated by the fact

19:10.320 --> 19:15.160
that Bobby Kotick is still the CEO of Activision for some stupid reason.

19:15.160 --> 19:19.240
Um, I honestly was ready to walk in here tonight and say, I think the game of the year for

19:19.240 --> 19:21.760
2021 is nothing.

19:21.760 --> 19:27.080
And I think for the 20 years we've been doing this show, I think I probably would be fully

19:27.080 --> 19:31.520
justified in saying, I think this year, more than any other, nothing deserves to be the

19:31.520 --> 19:33.080
game of the year.

19:33.080 --> 19:37.660
Um, and it's not to say that every game that came out there year was bad.

19:37.660 --> 19:42.480
That's not what I'm saying, but I'm just saying our industry is, is not in a great point.

19:42.480 --> 19:48.320
And there was nothing that really grabbed me away from the old reliables, the old comfort

19:48.320 --> 19:50.280
foods.

19:50.280 --> 19:56.120
And I'm not sure 2021 was very successful in pushing things forward in the industry.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.240
In fact, it felt like a step backwards.

19:59.240 --> 20:05.680
So in a way, honestly, in many ways, my answer is 2021's game of the year is nothing.

20:05.680 --> 20:11.400
Um, but then I, I really, really, really, really, really thought about it and I've kind

20:11.400 --> 20:16.880
of thought about, okay, if this is supposed to be my game of the year and me and the things

20:16.880 --> 20:20.980
I've been going through and the things that I like, and a lot of the stuff that has been

20:20.980 --> 20:25.840
very important to me in my journey with a lot of the health issues I've talked about,

20:25.840 --> 20:31.220
um, in the past couple months, cause it really has been just the past few months and so forth.

20:31.220 --> 20:37.800
I think I've landed on that my personal game of the year is Pikmin Bloom, um, which probably

20:37.800 --> 20:38.840
isn't that surprising.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.980
I've always been a shill of some sorts for Niantic games just because I've really enjoyed

20:42.980 --> 20:45.680
things like Ingress, um, Pokemon Go.

20:45.680 --> 20:49.440
Um, heck, I played that Harry Potter game when it first came out before, you know, You

20:49.440 --> 20:51.680
Know Who was all over Twitter and we're not going to go there.

20:51.680 --> 20:55.320
Uh, I really was looking forward to the Catan, uh, and there are other releases.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.320
So, um, yeah, sure.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.480
Of course, there's always going to be that element of, and even non Niantic things like

20:59.480 --> 21:00.480
Orna.

21:00.480 --> 21:06.540
Um, I've always been super into like the GPS phone games, but I think Pikmin, while still

21:06.540 --> 21:12.120
having a ways to go and making that game better and a more, um, quality product, I think there's

21:12.120 --> 21:16.940
some game balance, some serious game balance issues and shop, uh, micro transaction balance

21:16.940 --> 21:18.560
issues the game has to address.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.960
And it's, it's really echoing a lot of the same stuff that's all over Reddit and all

21:21.960 --> 21:22.960
of that.

21:22.960 --> 21:28.800
But I think what the game has done very well is very well is it's done a very good job

21:28.800 --> 21:35.800
incentivizing walking without making it feel like too much, because let's be real in Ingress.

21:35.800 --> 21:39.280
A lot of people don't walk most of those portals and things that you got, you don't really

21:39.280 --> 21:40.280
walk to them.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.520
People are using their cars, their drive-bys.

21:42.520 --> 21:47.160
So yes, some portals are harder to get to than others and you have to walk to get them.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.160
Sure.

21:48.160 --> 21:53.280
Um, but you know, and I, I spent, especially those darn ones behind, you know, locked gates

21:53.280 --> 21:54.280
and property.

21:54.280 --> 22:00.720
I'm just saying, and I've spent more hours than, um, than not, uh, you know, playing

22:00.720 --> 22:04.680
Ingress probably, you know, so far, I'm not like knocking the game, but it's just, I,

22:04.680 --> 22:07.680
you don't really walk and get exercise playing that game.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.640
Um, Pokemon Go, same thing.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.120
It's a lot of drive-bys.

22:12.120 --> 22:17.240
It's a lot of, you know, that sort of thing in your car, catching Pokemon and maybe community

22:17.240 --> 22:19.280
days kind of get you out walking around.

22:19.280 --> 22:25.000
But even then there's a lot of stop, catch, go, stop, catch, go, stop, catch, go, right?

22:25.000 --> 22:28.840
Like Pokemon isn't really about the fitness for a lot of people.

22:28.840 --> 22:34.980
I think Pikmin has found that really good balance where you set it, forget it and move

22:34.980 --> 22:37.180
to get your rewards.

22:37.180 --> 22:42.020
And again, I don't think the game is perfect, but I'm just saying that I've walked a half

22:42.020 --> 22:46.100
a million steps in the last couple months.

22:46.100 --> 22:51.140
And this is the time more than anything I've needed incentive to keep me good and keep

22:51.140 --> 22:55.640
me on this track I've been on and Pikmin Bloom's been able to do that for me.

22:55.640 --> 23:00.560
So I think in many ways, the game is probably like the right place at the right time sort

23:00.560 --> 23:05.760
of thing, but I'm not going to apologize for the fact that those factors make it my favorite

23:05.760 --> 23:07.500
game of the year.

23:07.500 --> 23:11.120
So that's my answer.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.340
Looking at some comments in chat, Tiger Claw says, give it to Nintendo.

23:14.340 --> 23:15.340
What about Metroid Dread?

23:15.340 --> 23:17.340
I did give it to Nintendo.

23:17.340 --> 23:19.340
I love Metroid.

23:19.340 --> 23:24.660
I haven't finished Dread yet because I had some pain playing it.

23:24.660 --> 23:31.660
The control issues in that game, hold it back from being number one for me a little bit.

23:31.680 --> 23:35.800
Adris in chat says Endwalker for me.

23:35.800 --> 23:36.800
Great answer.

23:36.800 --> 23:37.800
I love Endwalker.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.180
I love Final Fantasy 14.

23:39.180 --> 23:41.920
I hate the sound issues that still aren't fixed.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.480
Hopefully they're supposed to be in the next patch.

23:43.480 --> 23:47.760
I hate the cue issues that have arisen.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.760
I still love Endwalker.

23:48.760 --> 23:54.520
I still love Final Fantasy 14, but I'm not sure I felt as good about it as I did Shadow

23:54.520 --> 24:01.040
Bringers, which was in my top three the year that came out.

24:01.420 --> 24:02.420
And Black Compat in chat.

24:02.420 --> 24:03.420
Hi there.

24:03.420 --> 24:05.300
I hope everybody's following your channel, by the way.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.340
Black Compat says Ubi, Acti, Bungie.

24:07.340 --> 24:10.060
So much Kaka duty going on in the industry.

24:10.060 --> 24:11.060
Absolutely.

24:11.060 --> 24:16.220
And that's why I think in many ways, like the maybe the game of the year, I know I said

24:16.220 --> 24:23.540
nothing, but maybe the game of the year needs to be the workers, the frontline workers,

24:23.540 --> 24:27.340
the people that need the credit and do the work for what's going on.

24:27.340 --> 24:32.960
And I'm not sure exactly how to articulate that, because I know nothing sounds like a

24:32.960 --> 24:37.040
big negative, but I think I say that more like the industry kind of needs to take a

24:37.040 --> 24:38.600
look at itself sort of thing.

24:38.600 --> 24:39.600
That makes sense.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
I don't know.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.600
Anyway.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
OK.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.740
So that was looking backward.

24:44.740 --> 24:46.000
Let's look forward.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.280
What do we predict?

24:47.280 --> 24:52.440
Now we're not in person, so I don't have the little robot and all that stuff, but we can

24:52.440 --> 24:59.560
always make a clip out of this Darth Vader 10 and revisit it later of our 2022 predictions.

24:59.560 --> 25:05.160
So I'm curious, what do you guys think is going to happen in the industry in 2022?

25:05.160 --> 25:09.380
Do you have any safe predictions or outrageous predictions?

25:09.380 --> 25:10.380
What are your guesses?

25:10.380 --> 25:12.080
So Dark Sakura, I'll start with you again.

25:12.080 --> 25:15.860
What is one prediction you have about the games industry for 2022?

25:15.860 --> 25:20.680
As much as I hate it, they are still going to try to pull this NFT bullshit.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.120
The NFT bullshit is not going to slow down.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.120
Interesting.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.720
Because I know we have a story coming up on that later.

25:26.720 --> 25:27.720
We do.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.920
That indicates companies don't learn.

25:29.920 --> 25:30.920
Interesting.

25:30.920 --> 25:31.920
OK.

25:31.920 --> 25:38.720
I think that they're going to find some other way to make it attractive or just do it anyway.

25:38.720 --> 25:41.120
And people are going to want to play certain things.

25:41.120 --> 25:45.720
You're going to do it with the with the irresistible title.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.460
I think there is something to that.

25:47.460 --> 25:53.520
And I tend to agree that they're going to force the narrative to be NFTs are a success

25:53.520 --> 25:57.560
because they're going to tie it to something that's not going to fail.

25:57.560 --> 26:01.140
They're going to tie it to make it sound like they're spending their in-game currency.

26:01.140 --> 26:02.140
Yes.

26:02.140 --> 26:03.140
To buy a thing.

26:03.140 --> 26:04.140
Yes.

26:04.140 --> 26:09.180
But they have to spend money to buy their in-game currency.

26:09.180 --> 26:15.060
And they will own this thing, yes, because it is an NFT, but it has in the end cost actual

26:15.060 --> 26:18.860
money for them to acquire the points to buy the item.

26:18.860 --> 26:21.340
And as far as they know, it's in game.

26:21.340 --> 26:22.620
It's an in-game item.

26:22.620 --> 26:23.620
They'll tie.

26:23.620 --> 26:25.560
They're going to make it entirely deceptive.

26:25.560 --> 26:31.900
They'll tie FIFA packs to NFTs or something like that and say, oh, look at what a success

26:31.900 --> 26:35.260
NFTs are when it's like people weren't buying it for that.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.140
They're buying it for other stuff.

26:37.140 --> 26:38.140
Right.

26:38.140 --> 26:41.180
So that's where I think it's going to go.

26:41.180 --> 26:42.180
OK.

26:42.180 --> 26:44.140
It's going to have to become a deceptive practice.

26:44.220 --> 26:49.180
Just kind of like how loot crates, you know, were a fairly deceptive practice.

26:49.180 --> 26:50.260
All right.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.260
I get it.

26:51.260 --> 26:52.260
I'm with you there.

26:52.260 --> 26:53.820
I kind of agree with that one.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.980
Loki, what about one of yours?

26:56.980 --> 27:01.420
Bobby Kotick is still going to be CEO of Activision Blizzard and he's going to even receive more

27:01.420 --> 27:02.420
money this year.

27:02.420 --> 27:03.420
I hate that.

27:03.420 --> 27:04.420
I hate it.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.340
I don't disagree.

27:06.340 --> 27:10.700
It's ridiculous for me.

27:10.700 --> 27:11.700
Let's see.

27:11.700 --> 27:12.700
I'm going to predict.

27:13.260 --> 27:16.460
If Loki is going to take a safe one, I'm going to play a safe one, too.

27:16.460 --> 27:21.540
I think there will be a new Xbox series underscore for the holiday.

27:21.540 --> 27:28.460
I think this latest Xbox thing was kind of designed to do that, where they're going to

27:28.460 --> 27:32.740
release another thing in the series line is kind of like maybe the Xbox Pro or something

27:32.740 --> 27:33.740
like that.

27:33.740 --> 27:34.740
I don't know.

27:34.740 --> 27:35.740
But I think I think that would be a thing.

27:35.740 --> 27:39.060
I predict there's going to be an Xbox series.

27:39.060 --> 27:40.540
Why or something this year?

27:40.540 --> 27:48.660
I'll say X-Box series, double X, the Xbox series, triple X. All right.

27:48.660 --> 27:51.460
Any more anyone wants to throw out there?

27:51.460 --> 28:00.820
I'll open this up to our chatters as well.

28:00.820 --> 28:01.820
I don't know.

28:01.820 --> 28:09.780
Like, it's just it's the same disappointment all year round.

28:09.780 --> 28:14.060
S.S.G.A. 100 Matt says, will you be able to go into a store and get a PlayStation 5 this

28:14.060 --> 28:15.060
year?

28:15.060 --> 28:16.060
No.

28:16.060 --> 28:17.060
No.

28:17.060 --> 28:22.860
I think we're I think it'll still go the whole way to and I think that the VR thing

28:22.860 --> 28:25.020
is going to have the same problem.

28:25.020 --> 28:31.460
And I also think this is why and I'm going to say no Nintendo Switch upgrade this year

28:31.460 --> 28:35.380
or well, no major Nintendo Switch upgrade this year.

28:35.380 --> 28:40.580
They'll do something like, you know, LED, you know, something that's that's minorly

28:40.580 --> 28:41.580
incremental.

28:41.580 --> 28:47.820
But I predict no major switch update until I think they'll go with the off season again.

28:47.820 --> 28:49.740
Nintendo doesn't need to be on the holiday.

28:49.740 --> 28:52.420
I say March 2023.

28:52.420 --> 28:53.420
I got one.

28:53.420 --> 28:55.140
I got one.

28:55.140 --> 28:56.140
OK.

28:56.140 --> 29:00.740
The Intellivision MECO isn't coming out this year, and in fact, they don't release it.

29:00.740 --> 29:04.300
They just canceled the project.

29:04.300 --> 29:12.620
OK, OK, OK.

29:12.620 --> 29:13.620
Let's see.

29:13.620 --> 29:18.740
She Hulk in chat says game pass on Switch 2022.

29:18.740 --> 29:21.420
There's something about that that doesn't click for me.

29:21.420 --> 29:24.500
Like what does Nintendo have to gain from that?

29:24.500 --> 29:26.740
That's the only thing that doesn't like like I want to see it.

29:26.740 --> 29:27.740
Don't get me wrong.

29:27.740 --> 29:32.620
I'm just not sure I understand what Nintendo would really get from that unless there's

29:32.620 --> 29:37.420
something to be said about like Nintendo games on the Xbox platform, which makes absolutely

29:37.420 --> 29:38.420
no sense.

29:38.420 --> 29:39.420
I love that.

29:39.420 --> 29:41.900
Yeah, like maybe money, I guess.

29:41.900 --> 29:45.740
Yeah, maybe they throw a shitload of money at it.

29:45.740 --> 29:46.740
Maybe.

29:46.740 --> 29:47.740
Come on.

29:47.740 --> 29:48.740
Pull a Sega.

29:48.740 --> 29:49.740
It worked well for them.

29:49.740 --> 29:50.740
Right.

29:50.740 --> 29:51.740
Hey.

29:51.740 --> 29:57.340
Adrian chat says attempt to tie games into the metaverse virtual spaces.

29:57.340 --> 29:58.900
Oh, I kind of like that.

29:58.900 --> 29:59.900
You know what?

29:59.900 --> 30:01.860
I'll go with a crazy pick along those lines.

30:01.860 --> 30:09.140
I'm going to say that long rumored PlayStation home reboot for VR is a VR to launch thing.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.140
Why not?

30:10.140 --> 30:11.140
I'll go.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.140
I'll go.

30:12.140 --> 30:15.480
The PlayStation home reboot is a VR to thing.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.540
I'll go with that.

30:18.540 --> 30:20.540
I like that one.

30:20.540 --> 30:26.860
OK, last call anymore.

30:26.860 --> 30:32.660
World predictions, Sony, Microsoft, PlayStation, the rest of the industry arcades.

30:32.660 --> 30:35.960
I think Stadia is going to keep going strong.

30:35.960 --> 30:40.940
So Google will continue to invest in Stadia when a lot of people said they would throw

30:40.940 --> 30:41.940
it away by now.

30:41.940 --> 30:49.220
Yeah, I mean, indeed, there hasn't been any sort of notice about them slowing down with

30:49.220 --> 30:50.220
it.

30:50.220 --> 30:52.980
It apparently still seems to be making money.

30:52.980 --> 30:57.660
And there is quite a bit of a following around it now.

30:57.660 --> 30:59.100
The cult of Stadia grows.

30:59.100 --> 31:02.420
OK, I got some great games on there, too.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.700
I mean, I'll just put it out there.

31:04.700 --> 31:09.140
And then Epic is going to continue to bite off of everybody else's ideas.

31:09.140 --> 31:10.140
You know what, though?

31:10.140 --> 31:14.620
I was just going to say Dark Soccer talking about Stadia, I think maybe answered the question

31:14.620 --> 31:15.620
for me.

31:15.620 --> 31:19.220
What could Nintendo and Microsoft have to gain from a game pass partnership?

31:19.260 --> 31:26.660
I think if Nintendo is able to have a Microsoft cloud player, I think that's what it would

31:26.660 --> 31:27.660
be.

31:27.660 --> 31:29.540
Not Game Pass directly, reinstall the games.

31:29.540 --> 31:36.440
But if Nintendo Switch devices had a Microsoft cloud player on them to play Game Pass games.

31:36.440 --> 31:40.420
Because Microsoft, I don't think, is interested in that portable gaming space.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.420
We've never seen them go.

31:41.420 --> 31:43.780
I mean, yes, they have tablets, sure.

31:43.780 --> 31:51.240
But they realize, Phil Spencer and many people at Microsoft realize the Nintendo Switch has

31:51.240 --> 31:59.180
broken through in a way that no Windows Phone or Surface tablet or any of Microsoft's to-go

31:59.180 --> 32:01.780
products are ever going to get to.

32:01.780 --> 32:07.380
And I think if Microsoft, maybe the alliance is, they'll do advertising for Nintendo Switch

32:07.380 --> 32:09.980
because Nintendo Switch plays the Microsoft cloud platform.

32:09.980 --> 32:12.940
I think that's where the agreement could ultimately be.

32:12.940 --> 32:17.340
So I will say, you gave me that aha moment in talking about Stadia.

32:17.340 --> 32:20.940
I think that's the win for that alliance happening.

32:22.940 --> 32:27.900
Ooh, Mike Deftonchat says, E3 will turn into Summer Games Fest.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.040
ESA will let Jeff just do it all for them next year.

32:31.040 --> 32:34.100
Bobby Blackwolf says, the ESA wouldn't do that at this point.

32:34.100 --> 32:35.580
Too much animosity.

32:35.580 --> 32:37.140
They'll go under first.

32:37.140 --> 32:38.140
Thank you.

32:38.140 --> 32:39.140
That's a great prediction.

32:39.140 --> 32:40.940
The ESA goes under in 2023.

32:42.940 --> 32:50.500
There is no E3 2023 because people finally realize the ESA is a horribly managed organization

32:50.500 --> 32:56.580
that has grown behind the curve for far too long and has not been able to innovate in

32:56.580 --> 32:59.740
a way that a tech company needs to be able to innovate.

32:59.740 --> 33:02.580
So I think, thank you, Bobby.

33:02.580 --> 33:08.620
I think that's a pretty, maybe we're a little ways out, but I think there is no talk of

33:08.620 --> 33:12.620
ever returning to an in-person E3, and it has nothing to do with COVID.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.620
Let's see.

33:16.620 --> 33:20.580
Dark Tetsuya says, I know Switch does have a few cloud-based games, so if they could

33:20.580 --> 33:23.180
set up a full-on service for it, sure.

33:23.180 --> 33:26.940
Yes, I think there's a lot of good stuff there.

33:26.940 --> 33:30.940
Mike Deftonchat says, I would have gone with my yearly prediction of E3 and ESA disappearing,

33:30.940 --> 33:32.660
but it would have been three years in a row now.

33:32.660 --> 33:34.860
This is the year to do it, Deft.

33:34.860 --> 33:35.860
This is the year.

33:36.100 --> 33:40.620
S2 100 Matt says, the new Saints Row game comes out and Loki likes it.

33:40.620 --> 33:44.140
I'm not sure if that's a safe prediction.

33:44.140 --> 33:46.900
I think it's a wishful one.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.620
I mean, I'll probably play it.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.660
I mean, I'm definitely going to play it.

33:51.660 --> 33:52.660
I would hope so.

33:52.660 --> 33:54.660
It's like you're serious.

33:54.660 --> 33:59.100
Yeah, it is.

33:59.100 --> 34:02.580
And after all, like, you know, what am I going to do, wait until Grand Theft Auto 6 comes

34:02.580 --> 34:03.580
out?

34:03.580 --> 34:04.580
I mean, come on.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.300
Yikes.

34:06.300 --> 34:07.300
All right.

34:07.300 --> 34:11.900
I mean, it's just going to take, like, several decades for them to release it.

34:11.900 --> 34:12.900
OK, OK.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.380
Make this 2022 prediction then.

34:15.380 --> 34:19.100
Do we see a frame of Grand Theft Auto 6?

34:19.100 --> 34:20.100
No.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.100
OK.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.100
None.

34:22.100 --> 34:23.100
Zero.

34:23.100 --> 34:26.900
There'll be no announcements for Grand Theft Auto 6.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.780
All right.

34:28.780 --> 34:32.780
Let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have

34:32.780 --> 34:34.580
been playing this week.

34:34.580 --> 34:36.180
And we'll start with Dark Sakura.

34:36.180 --> 34:37.780
How was your gaming week?

34:37.780 --> 34:39.980
I played a lot of Dead by Daylight.

34:39.980 --> 34:47.500
I played 12 and a half hours of Dead by Daylight on Wednesday, and nobody really did anything.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.100
I was lurking for a little bit.

34:49.100 --> 34:55.860
Yeah, but I was, you know, trying to do a joinathon, hopefully, you know, get some more

34:55.860 --> 34:56.860
people interested.

34:56.860 --> 35:00.260
And I did get three adepts, though, by the way.

35:00.260 --> 35:01.260
There you go.

35:01.260 --> 35:07.020
I adapted Legion, I adapted Trickster and Clown.

35:07.020 --> 35:10.820
The thing is, is that I still have, like, 10 cakes left on Trickster, so I have to play

35:10.820 --> 35:17.140
him some more to use up those cakes before I, what's the word, prestige him?

35:17.140 --> 35:19.020
And I've been prestige-ing characters.

35:19.020 --> 35:25.060
So to date, the adepts that I have, and keep in mind, I am a mediocre player, so me getting

35:25.060 --> 35:27.940
any kind of adept is, like, a big deal for me.

35:27.940 --> 35:34.620
So I have Clown, Doctor, Ghostface, Hag, Huntress, which I did nothing but M1 Huntress.

35:34.620 --> 35:36.980
I didn't throw a single hatchet.

35:36.980 --> 35:42.900
I had a challenge to hit 10 people with just the regular axe.

35:42.900 --> 35:46.700
So I put on that thing that gives her, like, great movement speed when she doesn't have

35:46.700 --> 35:51.520
any hatchets, and then that thing that reduces her hatchets to one hatchet.

35:51.520 --> 35:56.140
So I got rid of my one hatchet, and I was instantly fast.

35:56.140 --> 36:00.260
And it was funny that people afterwards thought that it was hilarious.

36:00.260 --> 36:02.020
So I had a lot of fun.

36:02.020 --> 36:07.460
I also got, so I had Legion, Nightmare, Nurse, which I either had really new people because

36:07.460 --> 36:13.260
they were all Ash, or they were memeing, and that was fine.

36:13.260 --> 36:16.700
I don't mind them helping me get adept because that means I don't have to try on Nurse ever

36:16.700 --> 36:17.700
again.

36:17.700 --> 36:18.700
Yeah.

36:18.700 --> 36:21.540
And Trapper and Trickster, like I said, so those are the ones that I have.

36:21.540 --> 36:24.900
I'm working on Pig right now, which is...

36:24.900 --> 36:26.180
That's a hard one, I hear.

36:26.180 --> 36:27.180
It's a hard one.

36:27.180 --> 36:28.180
Her perks suck.

36:28.180 --> 36:29.180
I don't think I have a lot of adept killers.

36:29.180 --> 36:32.220
I've only done as well as I have because I'm decent at Pig.

36:32.220 --> 36:36.180
I have a lot of adept survivors because all you have to do is get out, and you just, sometimes

36:36.180 --> 36:40.060
you luck out, and you just have a killer that can't get you, and you get out and you get

36:40.060 --> 36:41.140
the adept.

36:41.140 --> 36:46.260
But killer ones are hard because you have to, like, you have to play a max game, basically.

36:46.260 --> 36:50.100
You have to double pip with only their base talents, which is tricky.

36:50.100 --> 36:54.020
You have to be way on top of your game, and I think it's highly imbalanced.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.060
I think it should be Blood Points.

36:56.060 --> 37:02.380
Yeah, and I don't think any killer, their three set base perk set is good.

37:02.380 --> 37:04.700
I don't think any killer has all three.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.500
I was gonna say Hag.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.940
I was gonna say Hag probably is the quote-unquote easiest.

37:08.940 --> 37:13.060
In fact, I think I might have adept Hag, so.

37:13.060 --> 37:18.860
And I will just say this, that the easiest of them all for me to get was Trapper.

37:18.860 --> 37:19.860
First try.

37:19.860 --> 37:20.860
Interesting.

37:20.860 --> 37:26.300
First try, but I lucked into the survivors that I got.

37:26.300 --> 37:30.700
And they were basically just letting me practice blinking the entire time.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.820
Like until I could get my blinks down.

37:32.820 --> 37:41.740
Sorry to interrupt, but of course, because you guys had to all jinx it for us for 2022,

37:41.740 --> 37:45.740
we just got the power company coming to our door saying that they're gonna shut the power

37:45.740 --> 37:49.020
off at some point for an hour.

37:49.020 --> 37:52.420
Thanks, you guys.

37:52.420 --> 37:53.420
Tonight?

37:53.420 --> 37:54.420
Tonight.

37:54.420 --> 37:55.420
Anytime.

37:55.420 --> 37:58.780
Because they're working on something.

37:58.780 --> 38:00.740
So thank you, 2022.

38:00.740 --> 38:03.700
We're just never gonna have a show, I guess, or a full show.

38:03.700 --> 38:05.700
I hate it here.

38:05.700 --> 38:10.020
All right, we'll get through as much as we can, and at least when we lose, Loki will

38:10.020 --> 38:11.020
know why.

38:11.020 --> 38:12.020
Jesus.

38:12.020 --> 38:13.020
Yeah.

38:13.020 --> 38:14.020
All right, Loki.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.100
For fuck's sake.

38:15.100 --> 38:16.100
Dark soccer.

38:16.100 --> 38:19.420
I don't mean to cut you off, but we probably should get to Loki's game a week.

38:19.420 --> 38:20.420
I'll finish mine after Loki.

38:20.420 --> 38:22.660
Okay, Loki, how was your game a week?

38:22.660 --> 38:26.420
It's all Minecraft and debugging stuff with our server, trying to figure out why it's

38:26.420 --> 38:27.580
laggy.

38:27.580 --> 38:28.580
No idea.

38:28.580 --> 38:29.580
Still trying to figure it out.

38:29.580 --> 38:30.580
Is it running on Comcast?

38:30.580 --> 38:31.580
I put out my new episode, though.

38:31.580 --> 38:32.580
I think there's a new episode out.

38:32.580 --> 38:34.780
I did see a new YouTube in our Discord server.

38:34.780 --> 38:35.780
Oh, yeah.

38:35.780 --> 38:36.780
So check that out.

38:36.780 --> 38:37.780
Okay, awesome.

38:37.780 --> 38:39.580
All right, Jamie, go ahead and finish up.

38:39.580 --> 38:43.500
I also played Demon's Tilt.

38:43.500 --> 38:47.140
That game is super fun.

38:47.140 --> 38:48.940
And of course, Fantasian.

38:48.940 --> 38:54.300
How can I leave out Fantasian, which I don't know what it is, but two of the boss battles

38:54.300 --> 38:58.940
that were giving me the biggest fits, I just blew them away.

38:58.940 --> 39:01.380
They were easy after that.

39:01.380 --> 39:04.900
And then I got to a place that I'm not supposed to do yet.

39:04.900 --> 39:09.420
So I played a little bit of it, and I'm backtracking some.

39:09.420 --> 39:10.420
What?

39:10.420 --> 39:11.420
All right.

39:11.420 --> 39:13.780
But it's fun.

39:13.780 --> 39:14.780
It's really great.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.900
Everyone should play it.

39:17.900 --> 39:18.900
My gaming week.

39:18.900 --> 39:21.660
Honestly, with the internet issues, it kind of cut into some stuff.

39:21.660 --> 39:28.820
So I didn't get to play a whole lot, but I did play some Final Fantasy XIV, of course.

39:28.820 --> 39:33.540
So my Gunbreaker got through the main scenario and is level 90.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.620
That all happened weeks ago, but now my Bard is level 90 as well.

39:36.620 --> 39:38.500
Bard's a lot of fun to play this time around.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.240
I've been kind of sleeping on it the last couple of expansions, but Bard's really cool

39:41.240 --> 39:42.240
this time.

39:42.240 --> 39:46.080
So I got Bard to 90, and then I've been working on crafting gatherings.

39:46.080 --> 39:50.360
So my minor botanist and then four of my crafters are all level 90 as well.

39:50.360 --> 39:54.720
So I've been pushing some of my classes there and just trying to do my daily dungeons to

39:54.720 --> 39:56.080
get tomes and all that good stuff.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.320
So there's that.

39:57.320 --> 40:00.960
I've also been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, no real accomplishments to scream

40:00.960 --> 40:01.960
about.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.880
Oh, I had such a bad squad today.

40:04.880 --> 40:08.280
I got that achievement for hooking three people in the basement.

40:08.320 --> 40:12.560
I thought you had to do it all at the same time, but apparently no, because I hooked

40:12.560 --> 40:14.920
a Mikaela who died down there.

40:14.920 --> 40:18.240
I was playing Freddy and I was a mean Freddy too.

40:18.240 --> 40:21.340
I was, you know, because I had a daily or something like that.

40:21.340 --> 40:26.000
So I hooked somebody down there and then I hooked two others after that.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.600
And I got, I wasn't trying to do a basement build, it was just very convenient.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.600
And I got that achievement.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.480
I was like, oh, I thought this would be a lot harder to get.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.480
Who knew?

40:33.480 --> 40:35.360
So you just have to hook three people in one game?

40:35.360 --> 40:36.360
Yeah.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.360
In the basement.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.440
That's an achievement.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.440
Do you know what it's called?

40:39.440 --> 40:42.400
Something about like holiday gathering or something, because it talks about the holiday

40:42.400 --> 40:43.400
tree or something.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.320
Cause that's what it's, uh, yeah.

40:45.320 --> 40:51.960
I think you might have to, uh, yeah, holiday, it might have to be sacrificing three people

40:51.960 --> 40:52.960
in the basement specifically.

40:52.960 --> 40:53.960
But I did do that.

40:53.960 --> 40:58.240
In a public match have at least three survivors hooked in the basement at the same time.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.800
Oh, happy holiday.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.080
No, there's, uh, milk and cookies.

41:02.080 --> 41:06.880
Um, no, the holiday get together means have three hooked in the basement at the same time.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.400
And guess what?

41:08.400 --> 41:09.400
It bugged for me.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.800
Cause Michaela was D E D dead, uh, when I hooked the other two.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.520
So that's, that's fascinating.

41:15.520 --> 41:18.680
I hooked one of them.

41:18.680 --> 41:19.680
Did they eat off the hook?

41:19.680 --> 41:21.720
No, I went wild.

41:21.720 --> 41:22.720
So I got an achievement.

41:22.720 --> 41:25.920
I probably shouldn't have gotten bugs in my Debbie.

41:25.920 --> 41:30.560
Uh, let's see, uh, what other games did I play this week?

41:30.560 --> 41:32.720
I played just a little bit of no man's sky.

41:32.720 --> 41:36.720
I'm waiting to see if they start up an expedition five or what I've been watching Alan play

41:37.560 --> 41:38.560
a lot of it.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.200
Uh, and, uh, we are going to do a multiplayer game hopefully real soon.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.200
So that'll be fun.

41:42.200 --> 41:47.400
Um, other than that location based games and the only other basement ones, there's Texas

41:47.400 --> 41:52.680
barbecue where you hook 25 survivors in the basement once per survivor per match.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.680
Huh?

41:53.680 --> 41:55.640
Then holiday get together is the one that you just got.

41:55.640 --> 41:56.640
Yeah.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.640
That's the one.

41:57.640 --> 41:58.640
Wow.

41:58.640 --> 41:59.640
All right.

41:59.640 --> 42:06.280
Um, you know, maybe it was bugging out in the way that, um, sometimes you run by a hook

42:06.840 --> 42:09.520
and you still hear the noises of someone on it, even though they've long been sacrificed.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.520
Yeah.

42:10.520 --> 42:14.560
I bet it's doing that because I think I did have them on three different hooks.

42:14.560 --> 42:18.560
I think that actually happens when someone is spectating.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.560
Oh, maybe.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.560
Maybe.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.560
All right.

42:21.560 --> 42:22.560
Anyway.

42:22.560 --> 42:23.560
Very likely.

42:23.560 --> 42:24.560
But, but anyway.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.560
Yeah.

42:25.560 --> 42:26.560
Yeah.

42:26.560 --> 42:27.560
All right.

42:27.560 --> 42:28.560
Uh, let's move on.

42:28.560 --> 42:29.560
Get into some gaming news.

42:29.560 --> 42:32.840
Um, Loki start us off while you still can.

42:32.840 --> 42:33.840
Yeah.

42:33.880 --> 42:40.880
So apparently, um, take two has purchased Zynga because take two is kind of a toxic

42:40.880 --> 42:46.480
company and now they purchase part of Activision Blizzard or wait, what's that part of Activision

42:46.480 --> 42:47.480
Blizzard?

42:47.480 --> 42:52.640
No, you're thinking King, King Candy Crush mobile companies.

42:52.640 --> 42:56.240
I confuse them in essentially the same, um, no anyways.

42:56.240 --> 43:01.960
So yeah, they purchase Zynga now because you know, how else do we compete with, you know,

43:01.960 --> 43:05.840
Activision Blizzard, but we'll have our own mobile company that, you know, they'll push

43:05.840 --> 43:06.840
out some other stuff.

43:06.840 --> 43:10.280
So they bought them for $12.7 billion.

43:10.280 --> 43:16.320
And honestly, I could not tell you what they have, uh, worked on recently, but apparently

43:16.320 --> 43:21.940
they're going to be maybe possibly bringing, you know, some of the take two franchises

43:21.940 --> 43:24.240
to mobile platforms.

43:24.240 --> 43:28.000
Looking forward to that mobile version of Bioshock.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.800
How much did they pay for Zynga?

43:29.800 --> 43:34.600
Because when I heard the amount, I was like, they're worth that much.

43:34.600 --> 43:35.600
Like, sorry.

43:35.600 --> 43:36.600
I'm not trying to be rude.

43:36.600 --> 43:37.600
Prize.

43:37.600 --> 43:38.600
Yeah.

43:38.600 --> 43:42.000
Considering that like, but the Farmville days are long gone.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.520
Those are long behind us.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.120
Like what games is he?

43:45.120 --> 43:46.120
Okay.

43:46.120 --> 43:49.320
Does Zynga make one of those games where like, okay, there was the one that Mariah

43:49.320 --> 43:52.680
Carey was in the commercial and now there's a new one.

43:52.680 --> 43:57.560
Alan was showing me this commercial that Kathy Bates was in and it's, and I've, I've seen

43:57.560 --> 44:00.260
this commercial without the celebrities.

44:00.260 --> 44:04.560
It's something about like a grandma with a, uh, a mystery or something.

44:04.560 --> 44:07.720
And she's like, like the whole commercial is like, grandma's being taken away in the

44:07.720 --> 44:12.600
back of a cop car and she holds up a sign that says like, he's still alive and all this

44:12.600 --> 44:13.600
stuff.

44:13.600 --> 44:17.880
And then, and it's a fucking match three game and it's like, yeah, it's not that.

44:17.880 --> 44:22.280
So they've put out like, um, some of their games that they put out recently, CSR racing

44:22.280 --> 44:25.480
to Zynga poker, a bunch of slot machine games.

44:25.480 --> 44:30.520
And then I guess they're also working on star Wars hunters, which is an arena combat game

44:30.520 --> 44:35.720
that's coming out on mobile and switch.

44:35.720 --> 44:36.720
I don't know.

44:36.720 --> 44:41.440
I don't think they're worth $12 billion, but I don't need, I forgot the Zynga starting

44:41.440 --> 44:43.300
to get into consoles though.

44:43.300 --> 44:44.360
Merge mansion.

44:44.360 --> 44:45.360
That's the name of it.

44:45.360 --> 44:47.720
So I'm totally giving them a free prop.

44:47.720 --> 44:52.120
I should make sure it's not a ABK product because we banned them from the show, but

44:52.120 --> 44:54.880
I don't think it, Oh, meta core is the name of the company.

44:54.880 --> 45:00.960
So it's not even Zynga, some new company, uh, that has apparently it has made $38 million

45:00.960 --> 45:05.480
with some weird ass fucking commercials, the newest one having Kathy Bates on it.

45:05.480 --> 45:06.480
So wild.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.480
Yeah.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.480
All right.

45:08.480 --> 45:13.000
Uh, Bobby points out, Rob, there's a Zynga developer.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.320
It was on your dragon con panel.

45:14.320 --> 45:15.320
She's working on hunters.

45:15.320 --> 45:16.880
I had no idea that was a Zynga product.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.200
I really didn't.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.720
Let's see.

45:19.720 --> 45:24.140
And uh, black and Pat says Zynga has a strong partnership with Hasbro.

45:24.140 --> 45:28.060
So boggle words with friends, all the damn farm bills.

45:28.060 --> 45:30.580
So many words with friends.

45:30.580 --> 45:31.580
Okay.

45:31.580 --> 45:37.380
That's one that I know is still big, um, and still does very well, uh, even amongst the

45:37.380 --> 45:38.900
wordle of the world.

45:38.900 --> 45:42.900
Oh, I don't think that made the show tonight, but, um, you know, all those knockoff wordle

45:42.900 --> 45:47.460
clones got like yanked from the Apple store and I think Google play as well.

45:47.460 --> 45:52.060
Um, I thought that was very interesting is that, uh, those wordle clones, which is weird

45:52.060 --> 45:55.580
because wordle isn't really an original concept.

45:55.580 --> 46:02.460
Um, the, the game show lingo was that, um, you know, it's nice to have that without that

46:02.460 --> 46:07.100
asshole Chuck Woolery hosting, but, uh, you know, wordles kind of a different thing.

46:07.100 --> 46:09.460
Um, so it's interesting that that'll got pulled.

46:09.460 --> 46:12.140
I wonder if they are going to do an official app or something along those lines.

46:12.140 --> 46:13.140
I don't know.

46:13.140 --> 46:17.220
But word games are always very popular, you know, dark soccer talked about, talks about

46:17.220 --> 46:18.220
that one every other week.

46:18.220 --> 46:20.180
Uh, yeah, I always play word scapes.

46:20.180 --> 46:21.180
Yeah.

46:21.300 --> 46:23.260
Even I played that for a little bit.

46:23.260 --> 46:25.780
So word games are very popular on mobile.

46:25.780 --> 46:28.500
So, um, black and Pat bringing up words with friends.

46:28.500 --> 46:30.940
That's definitely an aha moment.

46:30.940 --> 46:33.380
I think that one's definitely worth something.

46:33.380 --> 46:38.460
Um, Questbuster says last year was a bit rough for Zynga, but the acquisition fills in a

46:38.460 --> 46:40.420
mobile gap for take two.

46:40.420 --> 46:45.620
If I re if I recall correctly, only 10% of take two's business is dedicated to mobile.

46:45.620 --> 46:46.820
You're probably right.

46:46.820 --> 46:50.500
It's just, it still seems like such a lot of amount of money.

46:50.820 --> 46:51.820
Oh my gosh.

46:52.820 --> 46:53.820
All right.

46:54.820 --> 46:57.300
Ah, mobile games, mobile games.

46:57.300 --> 47:01.100
Have any of those crazy ads worked on any of you for mobile games?

47:01.100 --> 47:02.900
Cause one that I left ads.

47:02.900 --> 47:09.940
Well, I see them in, uh, like Instagram, like I, um, I was on, I don't, I don't, oh, you're

47:09.940 --> 47:10.940
so edgy.

47:10.940 --> 47:11.940
Oh my God.

47:11.940 --> 47:12.940
You don't ever see ads.

47:12.940 --> 47:13.940
You're so edgy.

47:13.940 --> 47:17.660
No, I mean, I don't use Instagram hardly at all anymore.

47:17.660 --> 47:18.660
You don't see ads anywhere?

47:18.820 --> 47:21.100
I have an ad blocker, so.

47:21.100 --> 47:22.100
On your mobile phone?

47:22.100 --> 47:23.100
Yeah.

47:23.100 --> 47:24.100
Okay.

47:24.100 --> 47:26.100
I have an ad blocker on my phone.

47:26.100 --> 47:27.100
Okay.

47:27.100 --> 47:28.100
Ooh, she's different.

47:28.100 --> 47:30.100
Um, all right.

47:30.100 --> 47:35.340
Look, uh, I see, I see ads on Instagram, I see ads on TikTok, I said, but one of the

47:35.340 --> 47:40.420
ones I saw on Instagram was a game called, um, I'm not, which is fine.

47:40.420 --> 47:42.140
They're not paying me so I don't have to get the name right.

47:42.140 --> 47:45.540
It was something like cat Island or something and it was a bunch of cats and it looked like

47:45.540 --> 47:47.340
an animal crossing game where they were on an Island.

47:47.340 --> 47:49.140
I was like, sign me the fuck up.

47:49.140 --> 47:50.980
So I played it and I was like, oh, kitties.

47:50.980 --> 47:53.500
And then I realized this isn't very good.

47:53.500 --> 47:56.780
So but I was just curious if those ads have ever worked on people.

47:56.780 --> 48:01.920
Those of you that, you know, are the, the, the, um, uh, the peons of the internet who

48:01.920 --> 48:07.380
still see ads, um, Mike Deaf says nope.

48:07.380 --> 48:12.980
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says everyone jokes about the raid shadow legends ads that streamers

48:12.980 --> 48:13.980
get.

48:13.980 --> 48:15.860
They're the audibles for podcasts of the streaming world.

48:15.860 --> 48:17.020
Oh yeah, I've heard of that.

48:17.700 --> 48:21.140
Cause that's the one that'll like pay you to do a sponsored stream and you get so much

48:21.140 --> 48:23.180
money for every person that signs up or something.

48:23.180 --> 48:24.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:24.180 --> 48:25.180
I've heard of that.

48:25.180 --> 48:26.180
All right.

48:26.180 --> 48:28.180
I've still never played it though.

48:28.180 --> 48:32.820
So my, my $3 or however much you get for, um, convincing someone to sign up is still

48:32.820 --> 48:33.820
up for grabs.

48:33.820 --> 48:34.820
I'll give you that.

48:34.820 --> 48:35.820
All right.

48:35.820 --> 48:41.300
Moving on for now though, let's talk about, uh, riot games and let's talk about a very

48:41.300 --> 48:45.900
interesting change that they're making, uh, in their world is that they are going to allow

48:45.900 --> 48:51.740
staff to leave with 25% of their salary, their yearly salary.

48:51.740 --> 48:57.580
Uh, and uh, this is a, from a blog post where CEO Nicola Laurent, uh, talks about the plan

48:57.580 --> 49:02.180
for the next five years in terms of the structure of the company and the content and the direction

49:02.180 --> 49:03.180
they're going.

49:03.180 --> 49:06.420
So I want to make clear when we talk about this, we're not talking about riot is laying

49:06.420 --> 49:10.700
people off or I'm telling people they need to go somewhere else and doing a contract

49:10.700 --> 49:14.740
buyout or, or just, well, there really is no contracts in California.

49:14.740 --> 49:18.940
It's a, uh, um, right to work or whatever they call it, state, uh, at will.

49:18.940 --> 49:19.940
That's it.

49:19.940 --> 49:20.940
Uh, employment state.

49:20.940 --> 49:25.540
Um, so, um, but my, but what I do think is interesting is that they're willing to basically

49:25.540 --> 49:30.020
say, Hey, if you don't like the direction we're going in, here's the money for you to

49:30.020 --> 49:31.020
leave.

49:31.020 --> 49:35.740
Um, and it creates a very interesting temptation for people too, because you know, let's say

49:35.740 --> 49:39.940
you make, I don't know, we'll say you make $80,000 a year.

49:39.940 --> 49:40.940
I don't know.

49:40.940 --> 49:41.940
Let's say 60.

49:41.940 --> 49:42.940
We'll go, we'll drop it a little bit.

49:42.940 --> 49:43.940
So the math's easier.

49:43.940 --> 49:44.940
Uh, Oh no, it's 25.

49:44.940 --> 49:45.940
Sorry.

49:45.940 --> 49:46.940
I thought it was a third.

49:46.940 --> 49:47.940
So 25%.

49:47.940 --> 49:49.220
We'll say, we'll say 70,000 then.

49:49.220 --> 49:50.220
Okay.

49:50.220 --> 49:56.020
So seven, uh, divided by this is about 12, $12,500 or something like that.

49:56.020 --> 50:00.820
If you're willing to walk out the door right away, um, no 17.

50:00.820 --> 50:01.820
I can't math.

50:01.820 --> 50:04.260
Why did I sign up for math tonight anyway?

50:04.260 --> 50:05.960
A substantial amount of money.

50:05.960 --> 50:11.260
So if you don't agree with the, uh, vision that the company has for the future, you can

50:11.260 --> 50:12.260
walk away.

50:12.260 --> 50:17.420
I know Riot's been under the microscope when we talk about a lot of this whole like harassment

50:17.420 --> 50:21.460
and women getting treated shitty and all of this stuff, you know, Riot's been under the

50:21.460 --> 50:23.100
microscope for that.

50:23.100 --> 50:29.060
And I will say to the CEO's credit, uh, this bold new direction for Riot is going to have

50:29.060 --> 50:30.060
none of that.

50:30.060 --> 50:32.500
Uh, or, you know, obviously, you know what I mean?

50:32.500 --> 50:36.820
The vision has none of that and hopefully they are able to, uh, make that a successful

50:36.820 --> 50:38.780
in a implementation.

50:38.780 --> 50:43.920
So basically if you don't, if you think that we're being politically correct, or if you

50:43.920 --> 50:49.040
think this company is too woke, then you can walk.

50:49.040 --> 50:54.740
So I, I, I do appreciate that element of it, that Riot's basically paying people to leave

50:54.740 --> 50:55.740
if they don't like it.

50:55.740 --> 50:57.740
Get the hell out of here.

50:57.740 --> 51:01.220
Um, uh, this is a policy they've actually had in place for a while.

51:01.220 --> 51:05.400
Um, but they're kind of upping it for the month of January to this 25%.

51:05.400 --> 51:12.260
But I guess new people to the company, uh, can always take 10% of their annual to leave.

51:12.260 --> 51:15.640
Like if they don't like it during onboarding orientation, that's a thing they have.

51:15.640 --> 51:18.500
I think that's a very interesting thing for companies to put out there.

51:18.500 --> 51:19.500
But you know what?

51:19.500 --> 51:22.600
It might sound like a lot of money to pay somebody 10% of their salary, but you know

51:22.600 --> 51:27.400
what the cost to like onboard somebody, train somebody, get them access to equipment and

51:27.400 --> 51:28.400
all that stuff.

51:28.400 --> 51:30.920
And the, the hours you're paying that, you know what, it adds up.

51:30.920 --> 51:35.160
And so to pay them to walk away rather than invest that it makes you know that they really

51:35.160 --> 51:36.400
want to be here.

51:36.400 --> 51:39.280
So that's, uh, that's very interesting, I think.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.680
So we'll see.

51:40.680 --> 51:44.880
I'd be curious to see how many employees take it.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.600
That's what I'll be interested to hear.

51:46.600 --> 51:47.600
All right.

51:47.600 --> 51:52.840
I'm very, uh, oh, uh, S2100 Matt with a comment over twitch.tv slash vog network says, treat

51:52.840 --> 51:55.000
your employees well with respect.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.320
You will get a better product and a happier employee that goes for any industry.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.680
It just benefits everyone to treat everyone well.

52:01.680 --> 52:02.680
Yeah.

52:02.680 --> 52:06.960
I mean, I'm not my day job here very much, but if they offered me 25% to leave, I wouldn't,

52:06.960 --> 52:07.960
I wouldn't take it.

52:07.960 --> 52:13.040
I'd rather stay there for several more years, um, because I'm, I'm happy with it and happy

52:13.040 --> 52:15.480
with the direction they're going and, and all that stuff.

52:15.480 --> 52:17.680
So like this buyout thing wouldn't work with me.

52:17.680 --> 52:21.200
Um, but I, I bet that's not true of a lot of people out there who, if their company

52:21.200 --> 52:23.320
offered something like this, they probably would take it.

52:23.320 --> 52:26.160
Um, and I get it, I get it.

52:26.160 --> 52:27.160
All right.

52:27.160 --> 52:28.160
Uh, moving on dark Sakura.

52:28.640 --> 52:33.840
Um, I think this is very interesting, this, uh, very mainstream press article you've got

52:33.840 --> 52:34.840
for us.

52:34.840 --> 52:42.440
I, the only reason that I am going back into NFTs talking about it is because New York

52:42.440 --> 52:46.640
times covered it about how pissed we are.

52:46.640 --> 52:51.000
After our disastrous show last week, I thought I would say the one thing I'm happy about

52:51.000 --> 52:53.420
our show getting cut short by the internet.

52:53.420 --> 52:56.040
We didn't get around to the NFT stories.

52:56.040 --> 53:00.080
Darn the Lord works in mysterious ways.

53:00.080 --> 53:01.080
All right.

53:01.080 --> 53:04.440
But, but yes, the New York times talking about it is, is very newsworthy.

53:04.440 --> 53:05.440
Yeah.

53:05.440 --> 53:11.480
And there is a, actually, you know, basically these different companies are coming out with,

53:11.480 --> 53:17.640
with NFTs and related content, trying to push it for games that people are really looking

53:17.640 --> 53:20.720
forward to playing or are already playing.

53:20.720 --> 53:28.120
And then the moment that it hits the internet, the, sorry, hiccup, um, the players are rebelling

53:28.120 --> 53:30.000
against it immediately.

53:30.000 --> 53:34.600
You know, they're like, no, we know what you're trying to do and we don't like it.

53:34.600 --> 53:44.560
Um, there is, uh, uh, a person named Mutahar Anas who is a, uh, uh, has a pretty big YouTube.

53:44.560 --> 53:48.640
Um, and I'm just going to read the quote exactly because that's how I feel about it.

53:48.760 --> 53:54.800
Uh, people are being sold buzzwords, uh, th those pushing NFTs and games are trying to

53:54.800 --> 53:56.720
sell you snake oil.

53:56.720 --> 54:07.560
Um, and really this is going back into, uh, a lot having to do with, uh, just how people

54:07.560 --> 54:09.840
are a lot more savvy these days.

54:09.840 --> 54:15.000
You know, we were gamers in general are older.

54:15.320 --> 54:23.880
We've been through seeing off, um, we've seen some shit, we've seen some shit, we've seen

54:23.880 --> 54:30.240
loot crates and, and buying, uh, outfits for characters.

54:30.240 --> 54:33.960
And I mean, shoot, Final Fantasy 14 is pretty terrible about it.

54:33.960 --> 54:37.480
I think we lived in an era of the engage people.

54:38.440 --> 54:46.360
Yeah, the, but this is now taking all of the, you know, buying stuff with in-game currency

54:46.360 --> 54:50.840
and just pushing it up a whole other, other notch.

54:50.840 --> 54:57.960
A lot of players are really seeing that these companies are trying to nickel and dime and

54:57.960 --> 55:03.160
suck the, their user base for every penny that they could possibly get out of them.

55:03.160 --> 55:04.520
And they've had enough.

55:05.160 --> 55:13.960
And it's, um, it's absolutely just, just disgusting.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.720
A lot of people are disgusted by it.

55:15.720 --> 55:24.200
Um, there, um, there's people who are saying, you know, well, if they've got this thing

55:24.200 --> 55:27.080
that's not available in the game, but I have to pay to get it.

55:27.080 --> 55:29.000
Why isn't it just available in the game?

55:29.000 --> 55:30.920
Anyway, I've bought this game.

55:30.920 --> 55:35.160
Why are you making me pay for more things that's already technically in the game?

55:36.120 --> 55:42.680
Um, and I mean, there has been some major blowback.

55:42.680 --> 55:53.160
Um, for example, uh, uh, Sega, um, got a lot of negative, uh, press after they, you know,

55:53.160 --> 55:58.040
had made public, uh, information about their plans to use NFT and crypto.

55:58.040 --> 56:03.480
Um, Ubisoft, um, we, we covered them at the end of the year.

56:03.480 --> 56:09.240
They also were really surprised at how unhappy their customers were.

56:10.120 --> 56:18.920
Um, yeah, there's a, in fact, the, there's a, a couple of, uh, YouTube videos out there

56:18.920 --> 56:24.040
talking about, uh, where, where they had made the announcement that got like 90% dislikes

56:24.040 --> 56:25.160
from the people that viewed it.

56:25.960 --> 56:28.600
Um, they're, uh,

56:31.720 --> 56:39.960
they're really, um, some people are thinking that their NFTs, well, the companies are saying

56:39.960 --> 56:42.680
that their NFTs are not motivated by profit.

56:42.680 --> 56:47.880
For example, uh, Matt Wolf at Zynga, his quote is that it's all about community.

56:47.880 --> 56:54.840
We believe in giving people the opportunity to play to earn, but no.

56:55.720 --> 57:04.120
The, the thing is about it is that, is that the whole thing is we're, we're not stupid.

57:04.840 --> 57:05.560
We're not stupid.

57:06.120 --> 57:07.880
A lot of people are stupid, but we're not.

57:07.880 --> 57:09.560
I'm, I'm very curious.

57:09.560 --> 57:12.680
I need to crowdsource or chat source this a bit.

57:12.680 --> 57:16.200
Is there, because I would be, I would be honestly curious of the perspective.

57:17.000 --> 57:23.160
Are there any like gaming podcasts or YouTube channels you all listen to that are pro NFT?

57:23.160 --> 57:24.280
And like, what's the angle.

57:24.280 --> 57:30.920
And I, I mean, things that existed before this that have decided they are pro NFT.

57:30.920 --> 57:37.240
I don't mean a show that started from some crypto folks who are now doing, getting into gaming.

57:37.240 --> 57:38.680
Cause then I don't want that.

57:38.680 --> 57:44.200
I want somebody who existed before that is pro and continuing with that.

57:44.200 --> 57:46.760
I would, I would be like, where are they?

57:46.760 --> 57:48.600
Cause I would like to hear that perspective.

57:49.080 --> 57:54.360
Well, I don't know from any on our level, but there are a couple of companies that are

57:54.360 --> 58:01.800
against NFTs, uh, valve for one thing, uh, uh, for steam, it prohibits, uh, blockchain

58:01.800 --> 58:04.600
games that allow cryptocurrencies or entities.

58:04.600 --> 58:05.080
Thank God.

58:05.080 --> 58:09.240
Cause how easy would it be to convert that, um, trading card system they have to something

58:09.240 --> 58:10.120
powered by NFT?

58:10.120 --> 58:12.440
And maybe that's why they get it.

58:12.440 --> 58:18.520
What's silly though, is like what these companies are trying to do is basically they're trying

58:18.520 --> 58:22.280
to do basically what valve is doing already with some of these trading cards and other

58:22.280 --> 58:23.080
things.

58:23.080 --> 58:27.640
It's, it's purchases where people can sell and trade stuff that they have.

58:27.640 --> 58:31.240
It doesn't need blockchain though, to track all that.

58:31.240 --> 58:32.920
They have a system that just does it.

58:32.920 --> 58:33.640
It's fine.

58:33.640 --> 58:38.200
And, and they make person, they make a cut off of every trade, which is kind of what

58:38.200 --> 58:39.160
the companies want.

58:39.160 --> 58:43.640
So like, I don't understand why we got to go this NFT route for all this stuff.

58:43.640 --> 58:48.040
Because it, the difference with an NFT is that there, you know, a lot of people are

58:48.040 --> 58:52.280
saying that these are going to be items that are transferable between games or that you

58:52.280 --> 58:58.120
can use this token for your NFT in other franchises by the same companies.

58:58.120 --> 59:00.600
That's sort of where you're taking out of it.

59:00.600 --> 59:01.320
That's the point.

59:01.320 --> 59:03.400
Never, never do that.

59:05.240 --> 59:10.760
Can you imagine if like FIFA, if, if EA decided that FIFA ultimate team stuff, that the players

59:10.760 --> 59:14.760
would be transferable between different players, do that.

59:15.560 --> 59:20.680
Outfits, items, you know, you would have something from one game that would affect the gameplay

59:20.680 --> 59:25.000
in another, you know, that's, it'll never happen.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.360
They'll never implement it that way.

59:26.360 --> 59:27.720
But, but Jamie's right.

59:27.720 --> 59:28.440
But Jamie's right.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.720
That's what they think is going to happen.

59:29.720 --> 59:32.840
Cause that was that whole talk around pinhead and dead by daylight and all that, which,

59:32.840 --> 59:35.720
which by the way, suddenly disappeared that chat.

59:36.600 --> 59:37.960
There's more about that by the way.

59:38.360 --> 59:43.720
On Thursday, I believe it's going to be five o'clock Pacific time.

59:44.280 --> 59:50.840
There is going to be, I have to find the channel again, but Doug Bradley and, and his wife,

59:50.840 --> 59:55.000
Steph are going to be talking about the recording session for dead by daylight.

59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.480
I caught last week's live show and this one looks to be fascinating.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.920
They usually keep their repeats up.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.400
They also did one with Robert England, but that one's gone, I think.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:12.440
But also Doug Bradley is just absolutely fascinating to hear talk outside of his pinhead voice.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:21.160
But, but back to, back to this, Tim Sweeney, the chief executive of Epic games said, and

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:26.680
this is actually the tweet, we aren't touching NFTs as the whole field is currently tangled

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:33.320
up with an intractable mix of scams, interesting decentralized tech foundations and scams.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.600
Um, although they're still allowing, um, third party developers on their store to allow blockchain.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:51.080
So I, this is, this is what my thought is going to happen.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.760
There's, they're going to keep trying.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.560
They're not admitting defeat yet.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:03.640
And I think that they're going to have, well, it's like what I said, right at the beginning

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:06.040
of the show, they're going to have to be deceptive about it.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.880
Does that make sense?

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.600
Yes.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:20.520
And they're going to have to put this out in a term that is going to appeal and separate

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:29.000
and separate the concept, or at least the buzzword of NFT from the concept of NFT.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.560
Um, and I, I just have to call out, have I gone robot?

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.880
Because the thing is we're losing frames.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.520
Nope.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.000
Okay.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.360
Well, you still find in me, let's try to push through.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:46.360
We're at an, now you are, I was, this is exactly the point that this started last week

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.480
was right an hour into the show.

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.480
Oh, like clockwork.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.200
Big NFT doesn't want us talking about it.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.200
So you're doing everything to shut down the system.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:01:59.880
Seriously.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:01.800
All right.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.840
Just try to keep powering through for the sake of the podcast listeners.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.240
I'm going to pray it sorts itself out in the next few minutes.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.320
It's not too bad right now to me.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.600
So yeah, it's fine.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.100
Okay.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.800
Uh, Loki, why don't you go ahead with your follow-up then?

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:20.440
Oh, speaking of NFTs, uh, Konami who, yeah, I guess they're making games still.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:27.400
Uh, they decided that, you know, with their NFT 35th anniversary memorial of the Castlevania

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:32.760
series, they went ahead and sold out of those NFTs and made the total of $162,000.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.160
And this is why these companies are going to keep getting into it because they can

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.360
literally produce something that takes no effort whatsoever.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.960
It is just an image.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:51.400
And then they can make $162,000 that's effort for profit is just, it's insane.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:57.880
Um, so yeah, they sold the highest selling item, I think was actually for 26,000, which

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.360
was a digital map of Dracula's castle.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.080
Um, it's just, that's just nuts.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.240
So yeah, it's here to stay.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:15.560
And one also, uh, another person that's gained of teases, none other than voice actor,

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:22.920
Troy Baker, who was partnering with voice verse NFTs to have an NFT, I guess of him

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.720
or his voice.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.320
I'm not really sure what it is, but nobody likes it.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.360
I like, I like Troy Baker saying he's my favorite voice in saints row, but like,

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:42.840
Yeah, I don't know what exactly it is that he's trying to get on, except somebody probably

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.320
sat him down and told him how he could make more money.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:50.120
And, um, you know, I guess, I guess Twitter is sure opening up his eyes real quick though,

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.960
as to why that's a bad idea.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:59.320
Um, but I, I'm just so disappointed that Konami got rewarded for the whole like Castlevania

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.440
NFTs and that whole thing, because we didn't get around to being able to talk about it

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.480
last week because the internet issues, which by the way, I've got a green light now.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.760
So maybe it was just a hiccup.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.760
Let's all hold hands and pray.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.680
Uh, but I think, I think chat, the live folks of the podcast won't notice anything, but

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.280
the live folks have been able to hear us, but they haven't been able to see us.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.000
So that does tell me my upload just got borked enough where the audio is getting through,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.160
but the video is not, but now it should be everything.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.600
So it's just crazy.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.080
Anyway, let's all hold hands and pray.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.560
Um, but meanwhile, the Castlevania thing, like I just, it blows my mind how like you

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:37.480
can say that somebody owns a song as legendary as bloody tears.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.760
Not in this fucking house.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.480
You don't, that song belongs to the people.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.600
That song is art.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.080
That song should belong to the composer.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.000
You don't own that song.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.520
I don't care how much you pay for it.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:56.840
I don't recognize that in this house, Rob, as a person who has done a lot of graphic

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:04.760
design, when you are contracted to do any kind of work, be it musical, anything like

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:10.760
that for a company, it is automatically a part of your contract that the company owns

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.880
your final work.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.680
Yeah, I get it.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:17.080
And that's how like, like BeatMania 2DX is still able to use Naoki songs, even though

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.520
he left the company a long time ago.

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:22.040
Like, yeah, I, I get it from that standpoint and the whole thing.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:26.680
And, and obviously when it comes to those sorts of situations and, and being able to

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.280
re-release the games with the music intact and all of that, then yes, great that the

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.000
company owns it.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.760
But I, like Joe Crypto Bro should keep their hands off that fucking song.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:46.520
Like, I, I don't, I think the best analogy to NFTs that I saw was the whole, like, you

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.840
know, those services where you register a star in the galaxy with your name on it and

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.040
it's in this database, but it's not NASA's database.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.560
So it doesn't really fucking matter.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.760
And that is not the actual scientific name of the star.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:02.840
That's how I feel about all this stuff is that y'all are buying into this database.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:08.360
And it's just like, okay, Bitcoin was the first crypto coin, but suddenly the first

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.120
major somebody's going to correct me on it.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:13.000
If I don't clarify it first major breakthrough crypto coin.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:18.680
There's going to be other forms of NFT and this whole stuff.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:26.600
And it's, it's, it's, it's going to literally fall up its own black hole asshole into this

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:33.400
void of non-existence because the seas will be polluted with all of these people trying

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:38.120
to get in on, on cashing out on receipts and naming rights, which is basically that whole

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:38.520
thing.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.360
Or better yet when people decide it's not worth anything and then it just devalues itself

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.000
to nothing.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:43.240
Yeah.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.640
It's like Mike Deft brings up this week and fuck Konami.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.600
You know, what's funny.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:54.680
I was sent the latest, uh, Jim Stephanie Sterling video on, uh, the fuck Konami and the NFT

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.320
stuff and, and what they had to say about the whole thing.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:00.120
I was actually a little disappointed.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:04.040
I thought the video would have a little more bite than it actually did.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.760
And that's no disrespect to, uh, Stephanie, who I think, I think they have some great

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:14.120
takes, but, um, I think it's just, they, they've beaten that horse dead, like so much.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.320
That's why it's like, you know, what, what more is there really to say?

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:21.240
It's kind of like at this point, they're kind of getting worn down by just the industry

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:21.720
and everything.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.680
And so I am a big fan of them.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:30.200
Um, it's just, it's just like, yeah, it's like, well, it's not too shocking because

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:30.840
it's Konami.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.000
So that, and that's okay.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.600
Stephanie it's, it's, it's like the last episode of our show.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.680
We tried, it didn't quite work.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.400
Okay.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.680
It's going to happen sometimes.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.560
It's okay.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.160
Uh, I'm, I'm still a fan.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.160
Uh, that's, yeah, but it definitely felt like one of those videos where it was like,

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:50.680
they're only doing this because they feel like they have to, or the fan base is going

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.120
to complain, you know?

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.280
But anyway, all right.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.960
Uh, let's move on.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.280
I don't want to talk about NFTs anymore.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.560
I got no fucking time for those.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.680
Let's talk about, let's talk about something for some reason you still can't buy, which

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.680
is Final Fantasy 14.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:14.360
Uh, because Final Fantasy 14 has been continuing to have server issues, but a roadmap was posted

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.600
this week that will include resales of the game going back on sale.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:23.240
So Final Fantasy 14, if you are not on board with the game yet, uh, and you've wanted to

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.520
get in on it because of all the Endwalker hype, because the servers have been having

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:31.080
so many issues, you can't, you can't do it right now, but as of January 25th, you will

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.600
be able to buy the game again.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.840
Have you ever heard of a game company pulling a game off a shelf for a month only to put

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.240
it back because the game is too popular?

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.080
This is like I said, 2021 crazy year for games.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:49.240
Um, so, uh, but now Kiyoshita did point out, or did put out a list of where, so what's

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:54.040
going to change on January 25th, according to this roadmap, the Oceana data server is

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.080
going to open.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:00.120
So, um, Australia, New Zealand, and you know, some of the Pacific rim, that whole part of

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.200
the world is going to get their own servers.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.360
So that's going to be people that come off of where those people are playing now, which

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:09.480
is mostly the Japanese servers for a good chunk of that.

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.160
And some of the North American servers, even, because a lot of the Australians want to play

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.320
there, um, or Europe even.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.800
So it's going to involve a lot of those folks coming off of other data centers to play on

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.840
a dedicated data center.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:26.840
So they think that's going to be enough, um, to, uh, resale, resell the game again.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.960
The queue situation is also just talking firsthand.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.880
It's improved a little bit.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.680
It's still not great in prime time, but I can pretty reliably get on the game in my

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:40.680
usual hours of like eight or nine o'clock at night and not face a huge queue.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.960
I think what's happened is that now the end Walker's been out for a month.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.240
The people that wanted to play through the main scenario have done it.

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.680
Um, and fantasy 14 has declared the end of spoiler warnings for end Walker.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.880
So I guess we can openly talk about spoilers for the game now in their eyes.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.080
I'm not going to do it.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.520
We did a spoiler cast that's in the VoG network archives here on Twitch.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.640
If you want to go check it out.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.560
So I already have that all out of my system.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.680
So for those of you, cause I think even Jamie said she still wanted to play through it at

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.640
some point, I will not spoil y'all have your chance.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:15.240
But, um, I think square has basically, you know, taken that approach of, well, all the

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.040
people that really wanted to play it are through the game now.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.000
So, uh, we can probably open it up a little more than, um, they are going to be adding

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.960
more worlds to the North American server and Europe throughout the rest of 2022 and into

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.080
2023.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.760
The roadmap is really long.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.160
I got to say, it doesn't look like they're really able to address the issues with North

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.600
America, which, you know, yes, I'm going to be selfish and only care about that for now

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.400
until August of 2022.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.040
Four new worlds will go online in August.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.360
That's I mean, I get that there are semiconductor shortages and all that, but damn pull the

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.960
servers for 11 and use them to run for it.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.840
I'm just kidding.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.880
Bob has 11 fans.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.360
Don't hate me.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.080
Don't hate me.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.600
But everyone's playing on pirate servers.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.480
It's never going to happen.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.000
Ziba in chat says the cues on the crystal data center have been double digits.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.920
I will run into the thousand person long queue still on Cactuar because again, I was there

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:25.000
first, but I happened to roll on the server where the very, very, very popular World of

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.560
Warcraft streamer who decided to take up Final Fantasy 14 and rather enjoyed it and

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.640
doesn't talk very favorably of wow anymore.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.600
And I happen to be on that person's server.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.480
I was there first.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.440
Thank you very much.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.680
And again, I don't want to gatekeep the game.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.520
I'm thrilled that person is there.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.120
I'm thrilled the community is there.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:48.040
I'm hoping that what we're supposed to get before August and that whole cross data center

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:54.920
thing is going to really help ease a lot of that because I know I am more than happy

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.840
to go log into crystal and go play with Ziba for the night.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:02.200
So I don't have to worry about the cues on Aether.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.160
And I think that will kind of work itself out at the end of the day.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.560
So I'm really, really hoping for the data center travel really soon.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:16.840
It's supposed to still come with, well, they're now saying not 6.1, but the 6.1X series.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:21.400
So it's going to be a few months still, but hopefully not too far out.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.320
All right, let's move on.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.080
Dark Sakura.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.720
I think this is an interesting trend in the workplace.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:37.240
Yeah, there are some video game studios who are taking to heart this thing that's been

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.920
tried in Japan for several different companies.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.040
And that's moving people to a four-day work week.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:50.840
I am going to go and say this, that they're not talking about a four-day work week like

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.840
I have because I work four by 10.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.960
These are for eight-hour days.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:02.520
And in fact, one of the companies, Crows, Crows, Crows,

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.160
they actually, they're the group that did the Stanley Parable.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:14.360
They have rewritten contracts to do the same pay for four days of work instead of five.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.960
And so far, so good.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:27.720
Eidos Montreal is actually pushing back against the crunch time hours and everything by trying

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:37.000
to also limit time and making sure that people are able to treat themselves with compassion.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.680
That's the quote coming back from Pew from Crows, Crows, Crows.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:52.120
But there has been lots of studies coming on that shows this is actually scientific

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:52.920
research.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:59.560
In Iceland, there was a trial run by the Reykjavik City Council that included over 2,500 workers,

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.160
which is 1% of the population.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:09.240
They're saying that the workers felt less stress and at work of burnout because their

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.080
work-life balance improved after adopting a shorter working week.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:17.560
They have more time to spend with their families, do hobbies and complete their household chores.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:26.600
And their productivity remained the same, even though they had gone down from 40 hours

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.880
to 35 or 36.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.080
The whole thing behind it is that they're saying that it's how the projects are being

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:43.400
managed, that if a project is being managed well, then they should be able to get the

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:58.360
same amount of work done in less time and that a more rested worker, a more, what's

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:05.240
the word I'm thinking of, a more fulfilled worker will work, will be happier and work

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:08.440
better because they're not running on empty.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:13.480
And I actually find it funny that they were using an example from Japan about this because

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.120
over there, it's considered to be a mark of honor if you fall asleep at your job.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:27.800
But they're really wanting work to be more dignified.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:38.120
They want it to be something that's going to be where they're working ethically, which

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:43.560
is harder for some of the bigger studios, which is why Eidos Montreal and Eidos Sherbrooke

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:50.840
are considered the biggest leaps in the industry as for taking this role because they are larger

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:51.400
studios.

01:15:52.280 --> 01:16:00.680
Both of them have done Final Fantasy games, Tomb Raider, because they worked under Square

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.640
Enix for a bit.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:08.040
And of course, they did Guardians of the Galaxy, which is one of the best games of last year.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.440
Yeah, I was just going to say Quest Buster just pointed that out in chat and I went,

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.440
oh yeah, speaking of 2021 games, that was way better than people thought it would be.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:27.480
Yeah, and they're really, I mean, in the end, a lot of these companies are really trying

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:32.120
to just be better to their employees and they're getting better results.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:39.720
And on top of that, one of the former producers at Crows Crows Crows, Alicia, I'm going to

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:49.080
mispronounce her name, contestable, I guess, was implementing the four day work week at

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.320
the studio that she's setting up.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:57.800
And she's basically saying that because they're implementing that into their work structure,

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.640
they're not losing any time at all.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.240
She thinks that her employees are going to be more resilient and well rested.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.920
And on top of that, they're also aiming for healthier work culture.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:16.760
And the quote is that it's one that's fundamentally anti-racist, feminist and LGBTQ plus friendly.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.240
I'm going to add the A because don't forget the A ever.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:27.880
And that according to a UK report, moving to a four day workweek can shrink carbon emissions,

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.280
reduces the energy used in a workplace and slash transport emissions for morning and evenings.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:39.400
And then giving an extra day off means that people take part in more low carbon activities,

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:42.680
including resting, exercising and seeing their family.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.040
So we'll see.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:53.720
Right now, I mean, the big thing we have going on is the series of of walkouts and strikes and

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.840
companies that have, you know, notoriously mistreating their employees, especially

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:03.800
their non cisgender white male employees.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:11.720
I think the work from home situation has also been very interesting, too, because it shows

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.800
most companies are able to do it.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.880
I get with game design, it can be a little tricky because, you know, the collaboration

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.880
and some of that is a little tricky.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.040
And that's why some games have had, you know, it's like Nintendo, like a lot of their stuff

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:28.040
has been delayed is because, you know, that that transition to work from home has been

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.480
difficult for a lot of people.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:33.400
But for those where it works and it has worked for many companies and many individuals within

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:37.960
those companies, I think that's very interesting, like that long term effect it's going to have.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:38.760
And it's also interesting.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:43.560
It's having this conversation about what about four day work, which I just realized in the

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.440
scroll bar, I have four hour work weeks.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.280
I meant to put four day work weeks for that, too.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.880
But yeah, four day work week.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:58.040
And I need to specify that it doesn't sound like they're wanting people to do four tens.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:06.760
It sounds like they are working a regular eight hour day, just four days a week.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:13.560
Now, for me, I'm going to go ahead and this is going to go into a little bit of personal

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.920
information on me.

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.440
I do four tens.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.240
I do.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:20.360
I do a four day, 10 hour work week.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.160
Well, 40 hours, but 10 hours each day.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:31.800
Now, I also have FMLA, intermittent FMLA, which lets me take off a certain number of

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.800
hours each month.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.720
I get 40 hours a month off.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:46.360
And I have noticed that I working an eight hour day, four days a week, because I was

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.760
running that before I did my narcolepsy test.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:53.320
I actually felt generally better.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:59.240
I felt like I could face my work day, that I wasn't super burnt by the, excuse me, by

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.120
the end of my day.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:11.240
So and now I read a few years ago that they were saying that for like people over 35,

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:21.000
that it's better health wise to work like three to four days a week as opposed to a

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.200
full five day week.

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.000
I only glanced at the study.

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:31.000
But thankfully right now, my work is still having us stay at home.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:38.760
And they're talking about moving to a hybrid schedule, which I plan on taking advantage

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:50.280
of that would be three days in the office and one day not, depending on the day of the

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.080
week, because they want people there on certain days of the week.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:59.720
And I honestly think that we should stay at home.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.480
I think that everybody, if you can work from home, you should stay at home.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:08.280
If you're in an environment that you feel that you'd be better around people, yes,

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.000
have the option.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:19.800
But the thing is that pushing people to be as productive with less presence, if that

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.520
makes sense, is better.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:30.280
Give people the time.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:30.600
Okay.

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.880
And also, I'll just type it in.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:34.200
Okay.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:38.280
As Joe and Matt in our chat says, this kind of goes back to what I said about a happy

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.080
employee.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.320
I think a lot of companies, oh, it just scrolled off.

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:45.080
I think a lot of companies are doing a lot of experimenting right now with helping employees

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:48.200
mentally by giving folks a proper work-life balance.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:48.840
I think it's great.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.640
And we need to find a way to give employees that work-life balance.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:51.880
Yeah.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:22:00.120
A lot of companies really kind of having to evaluate what that means in this day and age,

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:00.520
for sure.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:01.720
All right.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.800
Um, before we lose Loki, let's try to get some more stories out of him.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:06.680
Loki, what's next?

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.040
Oh, it's fine.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.560
I'll just connect to my phone when I'm done.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:10.840
Now we're here.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.320
Sure.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.480
So I'll be here the whole show.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.200
All right.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.080
That's the attitude.

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:15.580
Yeah.

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:16.840
Yeah.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:23.400
So, uh, Oprah or the Lego group is actually delaying some of the new Overwatch 2 sets

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:28.840
because, well, Overwatch 2 isn't out and other reasons as well.

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:36.120
So they were originally going to launch in February on the first, but now it's being

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.400
pushed back to next year because of the delay of the game.

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:45.800
Also, they're also considering they're reviewing their partnership with Activision Blizzard,

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:51.480
given the concerns about progress being made to address continuing allegations regarding

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:56.440
workplace culture, especially the treatment of female colleagues and creating a diverse

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.640
and inclusive environment.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.280
So yeah, there's that too.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:06.040
Um, I didn't know they were going to put out new, I didn't know.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.800
I didn't know they were putting out, I didn't know they were putting out

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:13.000
Overwatch 2 stuff either when the game's nowhere near done.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.480
So that's kind of fascinating, but you know what?

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:20.840
Props to Lego for doing something extremely actionable about the whole situation.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:26.040
And really, you know, especially with Bobby Kotick still in charge, um, who's, you know,

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.160
ultimately responsible for the work culture that he's created.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:34.600
Um, I, I think that, uh, this is great that Lego is, well, I mean, the situation fucking

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:39.320
sucks, but what Legos action is really meaningful in this situation.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:43.960
And, um, uh, yay, Lego for doing something.

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.640
Yeah, definitely.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:49.720
I mean, um, I didn't know it was coming out.

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:51.480
Maybe the green purposes is something else.

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:52.680
It's a pretty cool set.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.180
Yeah.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:54.300
All right.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.280
Okay.

01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:59.420
Let's talk about this because a lot of you have been sharing this one on social media

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:04.220
this week, and I do see the humor in it, but, uh, we had some police officers that were

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:05.980
fired and why were they fired?

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.580
Uh, because they were playing Pokemon Go on the job.

01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:12.380
But when I say they were playing Pokemon Go on the job, I mean, they were like really

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.900
playing it on the job.

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:19.180
Um, there was a report this week that two LAPD officers were patrolling a mall in the

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:23.900
Los Angeles area back in 2017, because our legal system is extremely slow.

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:28.220
And of course, Pokemon Go was still every, I mean, a lot of people still play Pokemon

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:28.860
Go today.

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:32.380
Uh, but even back in 2017, there were still many, many people playing it.

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:37.660
Um, and, uh, the control, you know, the people that talk about, Hey, go here.

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.500
Cause there's a call or there's an incident.

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:43.420
Uh, there was a, they were asked to respond to a robbery in progress.

01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:51.020
However, the officers instead went to go get a Snorlax at a nearby Pokemon gym, which I

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.180
have no idea where that was maybe at the mall or something.

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:59.260
Uh, apparently the whole thing was recorded because every patrol car has a D I V C S.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.420
I don't know what that is, but it's a monitoring system.

01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:04.940
So like they know where the cars are at all times.

01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:06.460
And so like a GPS thing.

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:06.700
Yeah.

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:13.820
Um, in the court documents, it said officer Mitchell alerted Lozano that Snorlax just

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:18.940
popped up at 46th and Limer after noting that Limer doesn't go all the way to 46.

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:20.060
Lozano responded.

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:21.340
Oh, you know what I can do?

01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:23.900
I'll go down 11th and swing up on Crenshaw.

01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:25.660
I know that way I can get to it.

01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:31.020
Mitchell suggested a different route and then told Lozano, we've got four minutes after

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.420
Mitchell apparently caught the Snorlax.

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.660
Oh, well, I'm glad this story had a happy ending.

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:41.820
After Mitchell apparently caught the Snorlax exclaiming, got him.

01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:48.060
Petitioners agreed to go get the Togetic and drove off when their car stopped.

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:51.340
Again, the monitoring system recorded Mitchell saying, don't run away.

01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.220
Don't run away.

01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:55.260
While Lozano described how he buried it and ultra bald.

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.140
Oh, they put in the court report.

01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:01.980
B-U-R-I-E-D buried it like in the ground.

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:06.460
I think what he meant to say was buried it like a raspberry.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:08.220
Uh, because that makes more sense.

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:12.300
That's really funny that the court documents butchered that English.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.180
It's a fun language.

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.540
It's probably just transcribed, you know?

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:18.060
It is funny.

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:23.420
Lozano described how he buried it and ultra bald the Togetic before announcing got him.

01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.580
Eventually, Mitchell explained, holy crap.

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:29.180
Finally, apparently in reference to catching the Togetic.

01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:32.300
And he remarked, the guys are going to be so jealous.

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:39.420
The Board of Rights had their own unique perspective on this, saying playing Pokemon Go

01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:44.620
showed complete disregard for the community, wasted resources, violated public trust,

01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:47.100
and was unprofessional and embarrassing to the department.

01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:52.060
They've done a lot of other stuff that's more embarrassing than that.

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:52.620
I know, right?

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:54.060
Should be embarrassed about.

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:59.340
Behavior reflected gross negligence, cowardice, lack of thoughtfulness, and deceit.

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:00.140
I know.

01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.940
And certainly there have been a lot of takes this week about,

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:06.380
oh, Pokemon goes the thing they're going to get in trouble for.

01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:08.700
I get it.

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:09.260
I get it.

01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:13.020
But a lot of people have been sharing that story this week.

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:17.820
I can't imagine why, but it is interesting.

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.220
I will say this.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:26.460
The times I've been pulled over by the police, which only actually happened once playing

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:31.820
Ingress, I was so easy, easily able to explain the game because I was like, okay, so, you

01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.220
know, Pokemon Go, it's like that.

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:36.140
And now they all know what it is.

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:40.780
I didn't really cross my mind that the police are all playing Pokemon Go, but I guess I

01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:41.660
guess that's that.

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:46.380
S2100, Matt says, we're going to need you to get out of here.

01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:50.540
Snorlax wasn't a big deal and go even in 2017.

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:51.420
It kind of was.

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:53.420
If you were newer to the game, it still kind of was.

01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:58.140
Anyway, all right, let's move on.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:03.180
Let's go back to a simpler time when the police were policing and not playing video games

01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:03.580
on the job.

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.980
But if they were playing video games, they might've been playing this.

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:10.220
Let me play the bumper for the segment and then we'll explain.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:13.420
No, I think actually we need to explain how it's different first because I don't have

01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:13.900
a lot of time.

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:15.340
I've already talked about it before.

01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:16.940
I know, but you did it on the no show.

01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.540
You haven't done it on the podcast.

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.340
So I didn't let the on the show that didn't last either.

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:25.900
I thought we didn't get to the segment last week, but I talked about it.

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.220
All right.

01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:28.860
Anyway, well, let's let's remind people.

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:32.380
We have a 2022 twist this year on the classic game of the week.

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:37.020
So once a month, and finally we're getting to it this month, dark soccer is going to

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.460
pick something different.

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:39.820
We've done classic soundtracks.

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:41.420
We've done classic 8-bit games.

01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:43.580
We've done classic peripherals.

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:46.060
And for 2022, dark soccer is going to do.

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:50.140
I'm doing classic electronic handheld game.

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:50.780
All right.

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:53.340
So that being said, let's get to the bumper.

01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:09.340
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault.

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.620
And pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:15.260
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:20.460
And she means, of course, classic electronic handheld.

01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.340
This is oops.

01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:23.980
And of course, the wrong screen is up.

01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:27.020
Go me.

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:29.740
Let's try flipping that around a little bit.

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.900
And gosh, darn it.

01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:33.820
The tab accidentally closed.

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:34.220
That's all right.

01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:37.340
Let me go back to the main show shots and dark soccer.

01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:40.860
Why don't you start talking about this and I will get in.

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:41.900
I'll get the footage up.

01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:42.400
Sorry.

01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:48.620
The game is the Tomy handheld Tron game.

01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:49.420
That's the first one.

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:51.260
It came out in 1982.

01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:55.580
It is one of three different games.

01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:00.940
It contains, sorry, three games that were based on different action sequences in Tron.

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:05.500
In the first one, you are playing a light cycle game around the game grid and you got

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.820
to cut off the other drivers.

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:14.220
The second one, Tron versus Sark, throw discs at each other, kind of like Pong.

01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:18.620
So, you know, but it's the whole ring fighting game.

01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:24.540
And then the last one, you have to throw your disc into the heart of the MCP to destroy

01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:25.040
it.

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:31.100
Once it's done, then you start over faster with a higher level of difficulty.

01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:36.220
Um, and this thing, it definitely looks very 80s.

01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:41.820
You know, it's the whole sort of square boxy shape, you know, with big button and everything

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:42.780
a switch in the middle.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:51.580
Um, it's, it's actually, I mean, keep in mind, this is, this was top notch when, when I was

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:52.080
six.

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:57.740
So, uh, this is still top notch at me being 43.

01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:58.300
Are you kidding?

01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:59.020
This looks rad.

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:06.140
Well, and it was called, um, they were called the, the TomyTronic, um, electric games.

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:10.540
They also did like, they had a scramble was one of them.

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:15.100
There was a Pac-Man that was circular, like a disc.

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:19.740
And it was one of the, uh, TomyTronic ones.

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:24.380
You know, they, they did a bunch of different ones like that, but I brought up the Tron

01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:27.660
one in particular because we love Tron here.

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:28.700
We love Tron here.

01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:31.740
We, we love Tron in this house.

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.380
And I thought that this one would be a neat one, you know?

01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:41.100
Um, and it is, it is pretty, pretty cool.

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:48.620
You know, you have the different light colors on the screen and it was all just, it was,

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:51.260
it was pretty, pretty tops when, when it came out.

01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.860
And on top of that, the box was cool.

01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:57.580
Just that big old Tron logo on it.

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:05.180
Of course, um, we, uh, there was one that was released, of course.

01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:07.900
Uh, there was a Japanese one, there was a US one.

01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:12.380
Um, they, you know, they had their own little manuals and everything.

01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:13.740
They were pretty cool.

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:18.380
Of course, our manuals were in black and white and the Japanese ones had pink accents on

01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:21.340
them, but that's it.

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:24.700
Not a lot to talk about.

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:26.940
Okay.

01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:27.260
Sorry.

01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:31.980
I, you caught me running back in the room from a potty break, but I was watching the

01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:35.180
B-roll earlier and it, this is like a machine I want to get my hands on.

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:37.100
How did you, and I'm sorry if I missed it.

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:39.820
How did you find, or how did you know of this?

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.340
Did you have a friend that had one or something?

01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:49.340
I had the TomyTronic, uh, Pac-Man when I was a kid.

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:50.940
Gotcha.

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:55.260
But I knew about the Tron one cause I had been on this big, like Tron kick.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.580
So I knew about it.

01:32:58.460 --> 01:32:58.960
Gotcha.

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:02.780
Uh, looking at some comments in chat, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, I would have totally

01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:04.780
gotten this if I saw it as a kid.

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:07.420
Uh, you were a kid, you didn't have your own money, Matt.

01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:08.540
That's all right.

01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:15.260
You would ask Santa for, or, uh, like I think I had one like a few years after, after it

01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:17.980
came out, like at a, from like a thrift store or something.

01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:19.980
Um, Ziba in chat.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:25.260
There was also like alien attack, which was also a neat one.

01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:27.420
Uh, Ziba in chat says, this is interesting.

01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:27.740
Yeah.

01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:30.860
And a lot of folks in chat saying, wow, I never heard of this, but this looks really

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:31.500
cool.

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:37.020
Well, this might be a theme that is repeated throughout the year 2022 as dark soccer gets

01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:40.060
into the classic electronic handhelds of the week.

01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:45.020
Cause I imagine, you know, most of our listeners, I know the hosts of the show are pretty much

01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.740
in their forties at this point, but a lot of the listeners, I think are more in their

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:48.940
twenties and thirties.

01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:52.860
So, um, literally a lot of machines that came out before you were born.

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:57.980
Um, and even for us, like we were young kids when these types of machines are out.

01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:00.860
So, um, I think there's going to be a lot of eBay listing.

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:02.860
How much do they want for these on eBay?

01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:07.740
Uh, one of the mid range ones is 180 bucks.

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.100
Jesus.

01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:14.540
And I'll link it in chat so that people can see, uh, some of the pictures on it.

01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:20.220
But, um, but it's, it's, you know, it's a neat way to see what it looked like all sides

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:21.180
of it and everything.

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:22.700
It's, it's, it's pretty cool.

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:23.660
All right.

01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:24.860
Well, there it is.

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:28.060
Your classic electronic handheld of the week.

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:28.700
Very cool.

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:29.100
Love it.

01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.140
All right.

01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:35.660
Let us now go around and do some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines

01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:38.220
happening amongst the game real quickly.

01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:42.780
Bobby Black with a chat says, I mean, some of us spend $800 on replica cabinets.

01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:46.140
So $180 for something like this is what I expected.

01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:47.740
$800.

01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:50.700
Bobby, are we not going to talk about the rush table?

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:52.940
Cause we should talk about the rush table.

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:56.380
Are we not going to talk about everything that's in my house?

01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:58.220
Exactly.

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:03.740
Which while Bobby starting his own little, he's starting the, uh, uh, East coast version

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:07.100
of that, uh, in the, in Bobby Bay, Bobby theater at Bobby Manor.

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:08.300
So, all right.

01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:10.700
All right.

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.420
Moving on, let's get to some rapid fire news.

01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:13.920
Loki.

01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:15.340
All right.

01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:21.980
So apparently we just found out that the Xbox one was, uh, they stopped production on it

01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:22.860
a couple of years ago.

01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:31.820
So apparently, um, we just found out that the Xbox one S, uh, was stopped in production

01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:34.460
at the end of 2020.

01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:44.220
And that the Xbox one X, um, apparently, well, that was stopped in, I guess, uh, July of

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:45.500
2020.

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:51.820
So now we know, not that it makes a difference.

01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:55.900
That was the wildest headline, you know, for them to come out and just be like, Oh, by

01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:58.140
the way, the Xbox one is done.

01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:02.540
Like I can't, I actually kind of admire them for being able to kind of like stealthily

01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:05.020
do that so that people would miss it.

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:09.420
Because, you know, if they came out and said, we're going to be ending the Xbox one in two

01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:13.900
months, everyone would have said, Oh, I'll never be able to get one.

01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:18.780
And you know, there would have been just ends for them to, it's such a, yeah, it's not such

01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:21.420
a big deal since everything's kind of backwards compatible anyways.

01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:27.020
So yeah, it's, it's very, uh, bold of them to be like, we got rid of this months ago

01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:28.220
and none of you noticed.

01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:35.500
So moving on as very, uh, very gaslight gatekeep girl boss, uh, on Microsoft part.

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:35.820
Yes.

01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:42.300
So, and then of course, um, following up, going back to our predictions for the air

01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:49.180
and house, uh, you know, CEOs of these corporate giants that is make way too much

01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:49.660
money.

01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:52.300
And a lot of times they're really toxic people.

01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:56.220
Well, now we have a list of those toxic people and the money that they made.

01:36:56.220 --> 01:37:01.180
So, uh, you know, Bobby, Bobby Kotick made $154 million.

01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:07.900
Um, we have, uh, Andrew Wilson made $34 million.

01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:10.300
And then what else?

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:13.180
Strauss Zelnick, only $18 million.

01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.260
Man has the money there.

01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:24.460
I know, uh, the top earner for 2020 was actually Robert, uh, and tookle with a play

01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:25.020
dig, huh?

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:27.500
Never heard of them, but $372 million.

01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:36.620
And then we also had folks, uh, Andrew paradise from skills and John Riccatello from unity

01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:39.820
on the list, NC soft razor and team seven.

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:42.860
I know none of these names except for John Riccatello.

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:44.300
I've heard that one, but none of the, yeah.

01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:45.100
Oh my God.

01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:45.660
Wow.

01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:52.700
Um, and then the very bottom lease out of the 42, uh, was Lars wing of her, uh, which

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:55.660
was an bracer group of $162,000.

01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:00.780
So just every time that they tell you that they need to raise prices of the games, because

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:03.820
they're just not making enough money to pay for these games.

01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:08.060
Maybe they could tap into some of that money that these CEOs are making, because I think

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:12.140
$154 million probably goes a long way when it comes to game development.

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.740
Just a thought, you know, you could live off of the interest.

01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:17.660
Yeah.

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:20.940
That much money would probably pay their developers a little bit more money.

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:24.460
You know, so fun.

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.820
Don't expect it to get any better, only worse.

01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:29.660
All right.

01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:30.220
Dark soccer.

01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:30.860
What do you have for us?

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:35.580
So, um, a game I love cotton.

01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:41.100
The cotton Sega, uh, Saturn classics are going to be coming on to PC before too long.

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:48.540
That includes a cotton to cotton boomerang and a guardian force, uh, cotton guardian force.

01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:52.540
Um, they are beautiful remastered games.

01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:59.340
The, uh, PS4 and Nintendo switch version, um, uh, were criticized because of input delay

01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:00.220
issues.

01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:05.820
And so it looks like there's going to be some, uh, patching done before the release and it

01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:06.700
should be coming out.

01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:11.900
And there's also going to be a new sequel cotton rock and roll is being developed to

01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:12.860
come out later this year.

01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:19.420
And then also the official logo for the street fighter 35th anniversary is out.

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:25.820
Um, and it will be celebrating its 30, 35th anniversary on August 12th.

01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:30.540
And they have teased things about the future of the series will be announced.

01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:36.060
So whatever the hell that is street fighter, although we do know there's final DLC.

01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:41.580
Uh, the, uh, character Luke will have an important role.

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:43.440
Hmm.

01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.180
All right.

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:47.020
All right.

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:49.500
Let's travel around the, I'm sorry, I'm having internet issues again.

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:52.860
So sorry if I'm going robot on you guys, but, uh, let's travel around the world and check

01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:56.220
out some release dates, uh, around the world, starting with the U S Loki.

01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:00.940
Uh, we have shadow man remastered on Nintendo switch.

01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:07.740
Uh, nobody saves the world on PC, Xbox one, which is dead, uh, Xbox series X.

01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:12.220
We have the RP RP golf legends.

01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:15.660
Uh, I guess that's, it's a role-playing golf game.

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:16.300
Awesome.

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:22.460
Uh, that's on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, Tom Clancy's rainbow

01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:28.540
six extraction on PC PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X and Stadia,

01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:35.980
uh, wind jammers two on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one and Stadia.

01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:38.940
And last but not least mouse craft on Xbox one.

01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:41.100
All right.

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:44.060
I know I'm a little robot, but in the recording, I'll sound fine.

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:45.900
So I'm going to push through for Japan.

01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:51.500
Uh, the Nintendo switch we'll be seeing, uh, the RP golf legends, uh, is actually releasing

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:51.900
over there.

01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:55.180
It's an English version, but it is getting a Japanese retail release this week on the

01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:56.300
20th for the switch.

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.220
And then a game called lucky dog.

01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:01.980
One is the only really other release on the switch this week in Japan.

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:07.260
Taking a look though at the PlayStation five, we have Tom Clancy's rainbow six extraction

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:09.180
it's a worldwide, including Japan.

01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:14.300
So they're getting it as well this week and that's really it for the Japanese releases.

01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:17.020
So let's check in with dark Sakura and the UK.

01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:25.820
Um, we have on the 18th, we have surviving the aftermath on the 20th, we have rainbow

01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:26.780
six extraction.

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:31.580
Um, we have expeditions Rome on the 21st.

01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:33.100
We have never song.

01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:38.700
We also have black wind and the dungeon of nay Hal book, I guess.

01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:42.380
I guess that's how it's pronounced.

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:43.680
Sure.

01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:45.840
That's it.

01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:47.260
All right.

01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:49.100
Let's get into some more news.

01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:49.600
Loki.

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:51.340
All right.

01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:54.700
So Sony's making more PlayStations.

01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:55.820
Isn't that exciting?

01:41:56.780 --> 01:42:01.820
They just have a four in front of them or after them, not the fives.

01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:05.500
So apparently since, you know, Hey, the fives are pretty hard to get, uh, we're going to

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:06.860
put out more PlayStation fours.

01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:14.380
Not exactly what people are looking for, but something, I guess I see what you did there

01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:15.500
looking for.

01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:18.640
Yeah.

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:20.540
So cool.

01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:24.460
I don't think it's been hard to get a PlayStation four though.

01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:31.740
So I, I think for some reason they think that this is going to keep people within the Sony

01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:33.340
brand or something like that.

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:37.340
Or maybe they're going to try to leverage more cloud stuff, or it's just the fact that

01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:42.940
the new exclusives for now are still, as far as I know, PlayStation four and PlayStation

01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:44.700
five, if I remember right.

01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:49.980
Um, you know, things like horizon forbidden West is going to play on a PlayStation four.

01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:52.940
So I guess, I mean,

01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.540
so that's good for the short term.

01:42:56.540 --> 01:43:00.300
I would just wait, honestly, though, if you're really looking for a PlayStation five, I think

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:04.700
a lot of people that are looking for a PlayStation five probably already have a PlayStation four.

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:11.340
So, uh, whatever, you know, it'd be ironic as if scalpers also were scalping these just,

01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:16.700
you know, just to show them just because they can just for the pure spite factor.

01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:18.460
I hate it.

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:22.380
Um, what about, um, can I, can I ask you real quick?

01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:23.660
Um, hopefully I'm coming through.

01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:23.980
Okay.

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:28.860
Audio wise on your end, but, um, the, um, we didn't quite get to it in the show world

01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:32.220
tonight, but I've definitely seen the rumors and maybe that's why we didn't show it because

01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:37.420
more rumors, uh, about the PlayStation three stuff on PlayStation five.

01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:41.820
Um, I guess there was a listing in a store somewhere that, or like the PlayStation store

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:44.060
had a PS three game in it for a hot minute.

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:46.380
And this has a lot of people speculating.

01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:48.540
Um, what do you think of that?

01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:52.940
That may be backwards compatibility is finally something that Sony is going to be

01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:57.980
They'll, they'll just be resold games just like they did at the PlayStation two.

01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:01.180
So digital, digital only and not running off your old disks.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:02.060
Right.

01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:02.220
Yeah.

01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:07.500
Cause it'll be even, I think it'll even be like, even if you own a copy of that on the

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:11.180
PlayStation three or whatever, that you wouldn't be able to play it because it'd be like a

01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.540
remaster or something like that.

01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:16.220
I don't remember if that's exactly how, I mean, obviously that would be how it had the

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:17.660
work on the PlayStation two.

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:23.020
Cause they didn't have a digital storefront for PlayStation two, um, for the PlayStation

01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:29.820
two, but, uh, for the PlayStation three, I would hope that like, if I own the game digitally

01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:32.860
that I could just play it digitally.

01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:37.340
But if they're going to sell it to you again, I'm sure that they're going to want that

01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:38.860
opportunity to sell to you again.

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:43.980
That would be incredibly shitty if like my digital library didn't roll over company that

01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:46.620
also charges $70 for their games.

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.900
So yeah, I know.

01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:55.020
Um, I I'm curious though, too, cause a lot of folks are noticing that the PlayStation

01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:57.580
now prepaid cards are starting to disappear.

01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:59.740
I guess that's been a whole thing as well.

01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:05.740
And folks are thinking that this, well, folks are thinking that this rumored PlayStation

01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:09.020
plus and cloud gaming getting rolled into that.

01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:12.380
And that whole thing may be all coming to a head here.

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:16.140
Um, that all of this is kind of together.

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:18.940
Like it's not a coincidence that this is all happening at once.

01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:20.620
And that may be the PlayStation three stuff.

01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:22.380
Is it all going to be cloud stuff?

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:25.260
Cool.

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.340
I, yeah, I don't know.

01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:29.900
Like, isn't that already cloud stuff now?

01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:33.420
I mean, like, it's just, I just don't want PlayStation now.

01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:33.900
Period.

01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:38.460
Like if, if like they had the, uh, I don't even know if they have the option of like

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:39.100
download stuff.

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:40.540
It's just, that's not interesting to me.

01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:43.100
I have a ton of games on the PlayStation.

01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:46.860
I just, I don't play PlayStation anymore.

01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:49.900
I don't want it either, especially with my shitty internet these days.

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:51.100
Yeah, exactly.

01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:54.620
Like, like it's like, Oh, but you can, you can stream it.

01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:55.260
Okay, cool.

01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:57.340
Don't want to do that though.

01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:59.900
Like I'd rather just play the disc I have or something.

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:00.140
Leo.

01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:03.660
It's like, I don't, whatever.

01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:04.140
That's fine.

01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:05.260
All right.

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:10.380
I thought this was an interesting thing that kind of, uh, crossed my desk.

01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:13.900
This week is one of those things that dark Tetsuya put down in front of my eyes and was

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:14.620
like, look at this.

01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:15.820
Cause this is interesting.

01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:16.460
And I agree.

01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:19.260
This is an article that a vice was running.

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:20.620
Uh, and I thought this was neat.

01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:27.900
Uh, apparently the y'all know, I'm sure anybody that is around our age knows of the epic NES

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:28.860
emulator.

01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:32.780
Nesticle was the name of it, which is a little bit dirty, but that was the point.

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.820
And there was also a followup emulator of sorts.

01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:38.780
There was Genesis that would play the Genesis games.

01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:39.260
Right.

01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:43.660
And the big deal about those emulators is that they were really the first bit.

01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:48.460
They weren't the first emulators, but they were the first to do it so well on a lower

01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:50.860
end computer that these, these.

01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:52.860
Emulators really caught fire.

01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:59.180
And, uh, I can tell you like those that my college years, those were huge and instrumental

01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:00.060
about those years.

01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:07.260
And there never was really a super Nesticle or SNES, which obviously kind of became the

01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:09.260
next thing that got emulated after the Genesis.

01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:12.140
And I remember, I think the big ones back in the day were like ZSNES.

01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:15.660
And I think there was another one, but we never really saw what the maker, cause it

01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:18.140
was one guy that did Nesticle.

01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:21.260
He might've had help or whatever, but it was basically all credited to one guy, Sardu,

01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:22.140
that did this.

01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:28.220
And, and I remember asking this question on a episode in the past, but that guy ended

01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:29.500
up going to work for EA.

01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:34.300
Sardu went to work for EA and he ended up working on sports titles.

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:41.340
And there's a big aha moment with all this because apparently what happened is that there

01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:47.500
was an Easter egg in a GameCube game that would run Super Punch-Out.

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:51.820
So, uh, the GameCube game was Fight Night round two.

01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:55.260
And in this Easter egg, you could actually play Super Punch-Out.

01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:59.980
Well, somebody through looking through the code found out that that whole thing was running

01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:05.180
on SNES-ticle, Super Nesticle, basically.

01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:12.540
So his original vision or whatever for, for what Super Nesticle was going to be, it was

01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:14.380
essentially bought by EA.

01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:17.900
Kind of going back to that whole comment Dark Soccer said earlier about when you do something

01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:19.420
for a company, the company now owns it.

01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:19.980
That's big.

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:24.780
So EA bought themselves some SNES-ticles basically to use as this.

01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:28.620
Now, obviously retro programming is not the only thing that the author is, you know, I'm

01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:31.180
sure doing at this point, but it is very interesting.

01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:32.380
Now, why is this relevant?

01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:35.740
We're talking about an old ass GameCube game in the Super Nesticle.

01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:39.180
Well, for one, I think a lot of people would be interested, like whatever happened to that,

01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:41.980
you know, that guy and his emulators and things like that.

01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:50.540
But what happened, a Swedish programmer recently, Johannes Holmberg, took this knowledge and

01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:57.820
basically reverse engineered Fight Night Round 2 to isolate that emulator.

01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:01.020
And it was only used to play Super Punch-Out.

01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:02.780
So who knew if it could run anything else?

01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:05.900
But it's now on GitHub.

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:11.580
There's a Python script on GitHub called the SNES-ticle Liberation Project, which you can

01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:17.980
find the URLs kind of long, but maybe somebody, if you can even hear me in chat right now,

01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:18.700
can link that.

01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:23.500
But yeah, it's basically a disk image file that will run SNES-ticle.

01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:26.620
And apparently most Super Nintendo games do run.

01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:33.180
Of course, they have to do more testing and there's even Mode 7 effects in it.

01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:37.020
And it's pointed out Super Punch-Out didn't really use those, but there are issues.

01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:41.340
Some of the controller mapping is a little wild and there is no two player support.

01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:44.620
So there's better Super Nintendo emulators out there.

01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:50.860
But I think this is very interesting because Sardu's particular emulators were such a huge

01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:54.300
part of the history of emulators when all is said and done.

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:58.860
I think this particular piece of work was very interesting to a lot of people.

01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:03.980
And I don't know if you think about it, the author of this thing.

01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:06.940
The guy that made Nesticle is probably like 40 or 50 now.

01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:11.020
So who knows how much he wants to be remembered for this type of stuff.

01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:13.900
But I just think it's very interesting.

01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:14.460
I really do.

01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:17.820
So yeah, looking in chat.

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:20.060
Oh, the other Super Nintendo emulator, I couldn't remember.

01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:22.460
SNES 9X.

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:23.180
That was the other one.

01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:25.020
They were kind of two that were big at the time.

01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:26.860
Yeah, good call out, you guys.

01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:28.780
That was always the one I used was SNES 9X.

01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:29.420
Yeah, yeah.

01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:32.620
One of them would do like internet multiplayer, but it really wasn't good.

01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:36.380
But I remember playing, I think I finally played through something like Secret of Evermore

01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:37.180
on one of those emulators.

01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:38.780
It was like Beast Nest as well.

01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:40.380
I mean, there was some of the Mac ones too.

01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:43.500
Like right now, I'm actually, I'm trying out Openemu.

01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:45.040
Yeah.

01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.380
It's just supposed to be like multi machine emulation.

01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:51.980
Dr. Tsuya in chat says, I just thought it was a really cool story.

01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:55.180
I remember hearing about SNESicle and the hidden Super Punch-Out.

01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:58.860
Yeah, I think it's fascinating because, and especially because like, again, those were

01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:01.660
my college years were playing the shit out of those emulators.

01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:07.820
And I know it's an illegal gray area, but being able to keep that at the forefront of

01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:13.580
my mind, enabled me to buy these retro collections all these years later and actually sign up

01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:18.460
for the Nintendo Switch online and spend way more than I'd care to admit on virtual console.

01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:21.020
It's almost as if you legally put the emulators out.

01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:23.100
A lot of times people will take advantage of it.

01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:23.740
That's for sure.

01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:28.940
Fifth Dream in chat says he just worked at EA back then, so he may have just stuck it

01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:30.220
in and now it's EA's.

01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:31.980
I doubt he just stuck it in.

01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:37.180
I don't think you do that when you're a new guy, you know, working on a game like that.

01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:40.300
I think they knew he built emulators.

01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:43.340
They had the rights to do this particular thing.

01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:44.540
They wanted it done well.

01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:47.900
And I think they used, I think they basically bought this guy's code to do it.

01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:50.380
So, interesting.

01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:51.820
All right.

01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:53.980
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:54.700
Dark Sakura.

01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:04.140
So, and I actually, I had posted this on my Twitter not long ago, but SNK versus Capcom

01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:06.700
Card Fighters Clash is on the Switch now.

01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:07.580
You can just go get it.

01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:10.780
It is a port of the Neo Geo Pocket Color game.

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:13.900
And it's $7.99.

01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:15.180
You can get it in the eShop.

01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:19.500
It's got characters all over both companies' history.

01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:22.300
And it was really popular and really fun.

01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:23.420
We've got the originals.

01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:27.740
We were totally into playing a bunch of that, remember?

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:28.140
Yeah.

01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:32.220
And I was, but this was, this was part of why I thought like this is very much like

01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:33.900
a Jamie alert for this week.

01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:37.660
And I know a lot of people were pleasantly surprised by the release of this on the Switch

01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:39.340
because it really did kind of come out of nowhere.

01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:41.980
Yeah.

01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:45.580
Well, I saw a post about it.

01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:46.940
I reposted it.

01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:52.460
I haven't gotten it yet, but I mean, it's definitely, I don't know.

01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:57.180
It's kind of one of those things that's like, I've got the original and I'm kind of don't

01:52:57.180 --> 01:53:00.620
want to go back and play it, but I know a lot of people do and a lot of people missed

01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:00.700
it.

01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:01.180
So it's great.

01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:01.820
It's a great one.

01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:05.500
All right.

01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.500
Especially because it has last blade characters in it.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:08.220
That makes me happy.

01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:13.580
So just quickly going back to the last story, because I'm pretty impressed with what Bobby

01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:16.780
Black Wolf is doing with his research here on Sardu and where he's been.

01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:23.500
Apparently Bobby found the LinkedIn profile and he works at Tiburon in Orlando.

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:24.620
So he works on Madden.

01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:26.540
So that's all on the public LinkedIn profile.

01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:32.380
And on the age portion, he graduated high school in 94, which if I remember correct

01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:33.020
was the same year.

01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:34.140
Yeah.

01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.740
So he's exactly your age.

01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:38.060
So that's what am I doing with my life?

01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:41.020
Well, a lot, a lot.

01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:43.020
You've done a podcast for 20 years.

01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:43.900
Where's your emulator?

01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:46.140
I'll emulate.

01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:49.420
That's still, you know what though?

01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:53.580
But the fact that, you know, the fact that he wrote an emulator then at a relatively

01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:57.420
young age, so he did that in college and it was better than anything else.

01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:01.660
It was so good that other game companies wanted to buy that talent.

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:03.900
That's very impressive.

01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:08.860
I hope he's making buku bucks at EA and, and that's the, that's the person that should

01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:10.700
be on the highest paid list.

01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.060
Not these fucking CEOs.

01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:13.980
Seriously.

01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:15.260
All right.

01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:21.500
Anyway, uh, Loki, speaking of people that should get paid, uh, people that, um, clean

01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:23.820
the internet of garbage should definitely get paid, right?

01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:25.180
Right.

01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:26.220
Yes, exactly.

01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:34.620
So apparently Twitch has purged over 15 million hate raid bots, uh, as of last year, um, to

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:36.620
which I have the follow-up question.

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:40.220
How were there 15 million hate raid bots on Twitch?

01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:45.020
They weren't doing, uh, account verification at the time.

01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:50.300
And since they brought in the account verification, it's taking quite a bit for, uh, some of

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.140
these bot accounts to get around it now.

01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:55.020
They're so, have you ever looked at the viewer list when you're streaming though?

01:54:55.020 --> 01:55:00.780
I have so many bots that hang out in my channel and for the most viewers are just lurkers.

01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:01.580
They're there.

01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:06.540
They're neither it's, I believe, you know, somebody feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:14.620
I believe that because Twitch's chat system is essentially a customized version of IRC,

01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:16.460
which we used to use back in the day.

01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:17.820
Right back in the day.

01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:17.980
Yeah.

01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:19.500
Which actually really wasn't that long ago.

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:25.260
If you think about it, we've only been on Twitch since like 2018, but, um, IRC, basically

01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:27.580
Twitch is running off a customized version of that.

01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:32.860
So I think a lot of these bots, and I think like Nightbot kind of leverages that a little

01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:33.100
bit.

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:37.820
It doesn't really watch your channel, but it's leveraging those IRC skeleton portions

01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:40.220
to, uh, respond to commands in this case.

01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:49.180
But you have all these other bots that are lurking, to which suddenly lurkers are speaking

01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:52.060
up and chat rep cycled says, uh, I'm real.

01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:52.700
I promise.

01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:53.980
All right.

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:57.820
No, I luckily I've seen your name before, so I know you're real, but I'm talking about

01:55:57.820 --> 01:56:00.940
in my personal stream, it'll say I have two viewers.

01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:04.220
And then I look at the list of who's in the channel and there's all these bots and you

01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:05.420
can tell their bot names.

01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:07.740
And I'm like, do I ban them?

01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:09.020
Cause they seem harmless.

01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:12.860
Like I just would like to know what data they're collecting.

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:15.980
Some, some of them are analytic bots.

01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:17.980
Some of them do belong to Twitch.

01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:18.380
Yeah.

01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:22.300
I'm fine with analytics and data and just curious Kathy's.

01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:23.500
I'm fine with all that.

01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:26.860
I, you know, it's obviously it's the haters that can go away.

01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:31.580
Like right now I have a bunch of people that are left in here from when I did my marathon

01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:33.260
who haven't left.

01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:34.540
Yeah.

01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:40.940
But like I have things like meta view, you know, just different trying to, you know,

01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:43.740
another TT, another TTV viewer.

01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:44.460
I've seen that one.

01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:47.740
So, so these are all just analytic.

01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:49.020
Some of them are analytic ones.

01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:55.180
Some of them are legit people, you know, uh, actually, you know, friends, you can click

01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:56.540
on, on the name.

01:56:56.540 --> 01:57:01.420
Like I'm clicking on just a bunch of names in a row and these are like actual people.

01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.660
Although my favorite one right now is broke my stream deck.

01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:10.140
Uh, and, and lurkers, you can feel free to lurk.

01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:11.980
I, I do not mind a lurker.

01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:13.420
I lurk in a lot of channels.

01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:14.700
I lurk in dark soccer's channel.

01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:15.980
Cause I like to watch on my Xbox.

01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:18.220
I saw you in there too.

01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:18.620
Yeah.

01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:19.260
Still lurking.

01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:29.500
I, I am fully down to, uh, to, um, what's the word I'm thinking of?

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:32.700
To, to let people, you know, hang out and lurk.

01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:34.060
I'll, I'll leave names in there.

01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:39.260
It's the moment that they start actually saying something that's harmful to my community.

01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:39.760
Oh, yeah.

01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:40.700
Barf.

01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:40.940
Yeah.

01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:44.700
Then, then, no, I'm not, um, I'm, I'm not down for that.

01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:46.700
I'm gonna ban them.

01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:51.740
There were also, um, I was using this tool that, that bourbon linked a while back.

01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:58.540
Um, who, uh, another awesome, uh, DBD and a new world streamer.

01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:05.660
Um, there was a tool that will let you look through your, um, your history of like who

01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:10.380
joined at like a certain time and by certain names and then let you just mass ban them.

01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:11.100
Oh, interesting.

01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.860
Which was wonderful.

01:58:12.860 --> 01:58:17.100
I've, I've got the tool somewhere and sometimes I still use it.

01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:22.620
That's why I like for my follower goal, my follower goal is like a few, you know,

01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:25.660
as it shows on my stream is a few off than what I actually have.

01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:30.940
So, um, yeah, it's kind of weird that way.

01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:34.780
It's funny you mentioned him too, because that's a perfect example of one of those channels.

01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:39.100
I think I've maybe ever said one thing in the chat room, but I've watched a lot just on my

01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:41.980
Xbox, like in the background when I'm, you know, doing it.

01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.420
So it's just, it's just funny.

01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:47.020
I have a lot of Twitch people like that where I haven't really, and there's others where like,

01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:48.300
I participate and it's nothing like.

01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:50.380
He's a great streamer.

01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:52.620
I wouldn't watch him in the first place, but it's just, you know,

01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:54.780
sometimes I'm just not able to actively chat.

01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:56.300
So I just lurk, you know?

01:58:57.340 --> 01:59:01.340
For me, it's weird to come out and suddenly say, hi, I'm watching.

01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:05.340
Yeah, he's, he's one of the ones that I can give shit to and get it back.

01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:06.140
And it's pretty fun.

01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:07.820
That's good.

01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:08.220
That's good.

01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:10.700
Tease him for his toxic Steve.

01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:12.860
All right.

01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:18.460
But yeah, but at any rate, I think that whatever it is that Twitch did,

01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:23.820
and I want to say that that verified user thing is a pretty big step in it.

01:59:23.820 --> 01:59:24.320
Yeah.

01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:27.580
I haven't seen very many hate raids.

01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:33.020
If anything, in some of my bigger streamer friends chats, I have seen,

01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:40.300
um, like a person come in and well, uh, actually a funny scenario was, um,

01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:43.580
it was, was it Lily Pie I was watching?

01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:44.540
I think it was Lily Pie.

01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:49.980
Um, who this person just came in being like this racist piece of shit.

01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:52.940
And she's like, I played like three ads while this person was in my chat.

01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:56.860
So I made money off of them.

01:59:57.420 --> 01:59:59.020
And then they take themselves out.

01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:00.380
Yeah.

02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:05.500
So yeah, there's, there's, yeah, I, I've seen a few spam bots and some occasional

02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:09.980
nerdom, uh, nerdy things and not in the good kind of way in people's chat, but,

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:14.700
uh, yeah, for the most part, like it seems that a lot of the tactics, which has been

02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:16.700
using has been effective and that's good.

02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:18.220
No, that's about time.

02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:20.060
Good way to start off 2022.

02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:24.460
I still think that they need to do something about their auto banning system.

02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:32.140
Because there were, there were people that were getting banned, um, for just for like

02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:34.780
stuff that wasn't actually like a real offense.

02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:39.180
And of course, nobody responds to it.

02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:41.020
They'd stay banned for that 30 days.

02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:44.540
And then it's a strike, especially bad for people who are trying to go for partner.

02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:45.040
Right.

02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:46.080
Yeah.

02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:51.980
Which I could use another, you know, 70 people watching my stream at any given point in time.

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:53.100
So could vog.

02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:54.060
So could my channel.

02:00:55.100 --> 02:01:00.940
It's just finding that wave to make you, uh, carry carry further.

02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:02.300
So, yeah.

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:02.800
All right.

02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:08.540
Um, speaking of big things on Twitch, uh, we have to, of course, in our last slotted

02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:13.900
story spot tonight, talk about AGDQ or awesome games done quick.

02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:18.380
And I'm sure many of you that listen to our show also listen to Bobby Black Wolf, who

02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:20.700
is live before us on Sunday nights.

02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:25.980
And I would encourage you to check out his podcast if you are a podcast person and not

02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:27.100
hearing his show live.

02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:32.780
But our pal Bobby was one of the hosts for this and hosted some of the speed runs.

02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:35.580
And I saw, um, I saw the earthbound one, a little bit of that.

02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:36.700
That was a lot of fun.

02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:39.100
And I watched some of the ones he wasn't hosting too.

02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:43.740
It's always a good event, very well received by, um, I think the gaming community, a lot

02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:45.340
of positive vibes in that chat room.

02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:47.260
They limited to subscribers only.

02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:51.900
So I honestly just that alone clears out a lot of the garbage, uh, because, you know,

02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:56.940
I, and I don't think subscribers only is an effective tactic for streamers like dark

02:01:56.940 --> 02:02:01.180
soccer myself, where we don't have the 70 plus people watching, but when you have 50,000

02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:03.820
people watching, it's very effective at keeping a lot of the trash out.

02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:05.260
So, um, they do a good job with that.

02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:08.540
And it's kind of fun to watch, uh, chat sometimes in there.

02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:13.500
Um, but games done quick also shattered records.

02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:16.540
They raised 3.4 million.

02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:21.260
That is the largest amount of money that games done quick, either summer or winter

02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:23.820
and the awesome version has ever raised.

02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:26.140
And, uh, that was for the prevent cancer foundation.

02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:27.420
So that's really cool.

02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:32.700
Also during the marathon, there were some new world records set, meaning the fastest

02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:38.220
games have ever been run, uh, including, uh, newer games like Kina bridge of spirits.

02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:45.340
Uh, and then, uh, pumpkin Jack, uh, Sekiro shadows die twice was a blindfolded that had

02:02:45.340 --> 02:02:45.900
a lot of people.

02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:49.260
I don't think that was a world record, but that was a, uh, uh, thing that had a lot of

02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:49.820
people.

02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:50.060
Yeah.

02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:52.460
I'm trying to teach crazy.

02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:55.420
That was just pretty, pretty awesome.

02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:56.140
Pretty incredible.

02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:56.940
It really is.

02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.700
So, uh, yeah, lots of good stuff to see.

02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:03.660
I, a lot of people were tweeting me about the, uh, not itg, which was like basically

02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:09.580
DDR and in the groove, just bananas level, like that level that just makes me exhausted

02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:13.660
looking at it and going like, oh, I'm definitely 40 years old.

02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:17.340
Uh, and that whole thing, but, um, props to the people that can do it.

02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:22.780
It's a very impressive show and help to raise all the money and smash the records at the

02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:23.260
end of the day.

02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:25.020
And isn't that what it's all about?

02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:27.100
All right.

02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:27.340
Yeah.

02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:28.300
Awesome.

02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:29.500
All right.

02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:31.980
Uh, let's get to the listener round table.

02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:35.740
Unfortunately with the internet cutting in and out, I know the live folks are having

02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:36.300
a hard time.

02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:37.740
I think they can still hear us.

02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:39.180
I know they can't see us.

02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:41.660
It's just blitzing in and out.

02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:44.940
I'm so sorry, but it's, there's really nothing I can do about it.

02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:50.780
Um, I will, I have a lot more to say on this next week for episode 900.

02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:54.620
Uh, I'll unfortunately, yes, I'm announcing an announcement, but I will leave you tease

02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:55.500
till then.

02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:58.860
Um, so, uh, just don't expect this to last forever.

02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:00.220
That's all I have to say.

02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:03.420
Uh, assuming that ding dong is the power going to be going out.

02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:06.860
Oh, is, oh, your power is about to, oh boy.

02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:07.260
Oh boy.

02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:08.220
What an ending.

02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:08.540
All right.

02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:13.340
Well, before we end, let me try to see if we got any emails at least to get into tonight.

02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:14.940
Okay, cool.

02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:17.740
Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:21.100
If you want to send us an email, uh, let's get to the one email that we got this week.

02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:23.340
This is back from the seventh.

02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:24.940
Um, hi, OLR.

02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:29.580
I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the quote fluff discussions on the post Christmas

02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:33.500
episode on the subject of free games that turned out to be a pleasant surprise.

02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:37.740
I bought a game boy advance on eBay a few years ago and it came with DK King of swing.

02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:43.020
I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it to be truly excellent and underrated platform

02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:43.500
game.

02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:48.780
The L and R buttons control each of donkey, uh, of donkey Kong's hands, which you use

02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:52.220
to grab pegs and swing yourself across around the stages.

02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:53.180
Super fun.

02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:57.580
Anyway, I hope y'all, uh, you all are staying safe and please keep up the good work Elliot B.

02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:01.420
Thank you for the email.

02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:04.940
And I love that, uh, the, the random stuff that you come across.

02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:08.220
And I thought the fluff segment thing worked out really well too.

02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:11.740
Um, you know, most weeks we actually have news to talk about, so I don't know how regular

02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:12.940
that segment will be.

02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:13.820
Uh, but thank you.

02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:14.700
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:16.780
It was a fun, uh, fun, fun night.

02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:17.500
So I'm sorry.

02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:22.780
It took us like four weeks to answer it, but, uh, it is 2022.

02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:24.620
It's just my God.

02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:25.900
It's all right.

02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:26.540
Sucks.

02:05:26.540 --> 02:05:27.100
It's all right.

02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:29.340
Things are gonna, things are gonna look onward and upward.

02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.820
Participate at orange launcher trader.com.

02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:34.140
If you have something you want to contribute in the future.

02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:37.820
Um, Loki, did you have any last minute stories you wanted to talk to us about?

02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:42.940
I don't, I don't.

02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:45.520
Okay.

02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:50.540
Well, unfortunately, uh, with the internet stuff, I think at least we got through a show,

02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:54.220
but I think the forces that be are kind of telling us perhaps it is time to just go ahead

02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:55.180
and wrap things up.

02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:57.900
And so I think that is what we will do for the night.

02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:00.940
Uh, Hey, we got two hours out at least I'm happy.

02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:02.700
It's uh, and the show was good.

02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:04.060
Uh, it's just, yeah.

02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:10.860
So much to say, and I'm going to say some stuff soon, but until then, let's go around

02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:13.580
and get everybody's final thoughts and dark soccer.

02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:14.460
I'll start with you tonight.

02:06:15.980 --> 02:06:17.980
Um, eat your vegetables.

02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:19.520
Okay.

02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:21.100
Broccoli is good.

02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:22.300
Bye.

02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:22.940
Have a good stream.

02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:24.140
All right.

02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:24.700
Thank you.

02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:25.260
Yep.

02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:27.900
Hopefully, uh, some more depths in dark soccer's future tonight.

02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:29.100
All right.

02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:33.900
Uh, meanwhile, uh, I'll say my final thought and, uh, I just pretty much already said it,

02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:39.020
but I was going to say, uh, next week is 900 episodes of OLR, which is no small feat.

02:06:39.020 --> 02:06:43.020
And I want to thank all of you that stick with us through thick and thin be at the podcast

02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:47.100
feed to be at here live through bandwidth, suffrage and all that stuff.

02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:48.460
Uh, really appreciate it.

02:06:48.460 --> 02:06:50.540
Uh, episode 900.

02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:55.660
I've got a personal announcement I'm going to make on the show that I'm really excited

02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:56.300
about.

02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:59.420
Uh, those of you that follow me on social media will probably see it sooner.

02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:04.380
Um, so I will, uh, talk about that and it's going to be, uh, it's also going to, it is

02:07:04.380 --> 02:07:08.060
going to affect the show, but it's going to be, I think, I think good stuff.

02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:10.060
So I hope, all right.

02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:13.820
Uh, Loki, uh, down to you.

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:15.180
Yeah.

02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:18.940
I'm just hopefully gonna put some more videos soon.

02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:22.700
I want to get back into live streaming and again too, at some point.

02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:22.940
Yeah.

02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:23.340
It's fun.

02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:24.060
You should.

02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:26.620
I've been trying to do as much of it as I can on weeknights.

02:07:26.620 --> 02:07:29.020
Uh, I forgot to talk about Final Fantasy four pixel remaster.

02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:30.460
I played more of that this week.

02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:33.900
Um, but I only did, I only did like maybe another hour and a half, but, uh, I'm still,

02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:38.300
I'm still enjoying it enough, uh, as much as the font still bothers me, but it is what

02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:39.100
it is.

02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:39.580
All right.

02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:42.780
Um, that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:46.140
Thank you guys again for sticking with us, uh, through thick and thin and through a kind

02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:47.740
of a rough start to our 20th year.

02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:50.540
But, um, it really can only go up from here.

02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:51.500
Baby steps, right?

02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:53.740
Have a good week, everybody.

02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:54.940
Thank you so much for being here.

02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:56.060
We'll see you next time.

02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:57.020
Happy gaming.

02:07:57.020 --> 02:07:57.420
Good night.

02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:25.420
They were all still true.

02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:29.420
See you next week.

02:08:53.740 --> 02:09:01.420
Bye.
