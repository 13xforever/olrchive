0	14400	This week, Nintendo Switch Online Nintendo 64 updates, Nintendo Switch Online Nintendo
14400	18520	64 updates, and Nintendo Switch Online Nintendo 64 updates.
18520	22620	This month's new game, this month's improved game or games, and next month's new game
22620	25420	that might also include next month's improved games.
25420	29260	These are a few headlines rolled into one theme, now it's time for the 900th episode
29260	33100	of Orange Lounge Radio, with your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give you
33100	36140	details on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show
36140	38140	where every gamer has a voice.
38140	47620	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
47620	49940	every gamer has a voice.
49940	57900	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 900 of our
57900	65100	show that is 900 for tonight, January the 23rd of 2022.
65100	71980	And with me as they have been since June of 2002, say hello to my co-hosts.
71980	74260	First off, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
74260	75260	Hi there.
75260	76260	Hi.
76260	77260	Hi.
77260	78260	Congratulations on 900 episodes.
78260	79260	You too.
79260	84460	If you could sum up 900 episodes of OLR in one word, what would it be?
84460	85460	What?
85460	87380	Okay, that's a good one.
87380	89660	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
89660	90660	Hi.
90660	91900	Hi, Loki.
91900	93900	Congrats on 900 episodes.
93900	94900	Yes.
94900	96060	I'll ask you the same question.
96060	100180	If you could sum up 900 episodes in one word, what would that be?
100180	102900	Okay, great.
102900	103900	Long.
103900	110900	Anyway, a big hi to our chat because we didn't know, did you have a real answer?
110900	111900	That's it.
111900	112900	Okay.
112900	113900	Long.
114420	119780	Um, I think, I think mine might be something like, oh my God, if you remember that old
119780	130940	YouTube except the internet in the past few episodes will be, oh my God, be something
130940	131940	like that.
131940	132980	But I'm going to get to that in a minute.
132980	136620	Uh, I do want to acknowledge our chat room of course, because we do tape live every Sunday
136620	141480	night at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash a VOG network, nine o'clock Eastern
141480	144800	six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby black Wolf show.
144800	150520	And I, I, I usually, I don't read the, um, bit cheers and the sub donations and things
150520	152480	like that until the end of the show.
152480	155760	Cause um, you know, a lot, I know a lot of like normal twitch streams you watch kind
155760	157040	of read that and say, thank you for that.
157040	158040	Thank you for that.
158040	162080	Um, but we are trying to record for our podcast, which people can of course download an iTunes,
162080	165000	Spotify, whatever their favorite podcast app is.
165000	169600	Um, but you go, oh my gosh, like I see you guys donating lots of bits.
169600	175320	I'm seeing, oh my God, there's another five subs, 900 bits, uh, that, and that's not like
175320	177980	a small amount of money, uh, that you guys are saying congrats.
177980	180480	And I'm like, oh my God, do we just get a hype train all the way to level five?
180480	181480	I think we did.
181480	182480	I think we did.
182480	183480	Oh my God.
183480	184480	Thank you so much.
184480	186040	And I just big love to the community.
186040	189920	We, we really wouldn't get to 900 episodes without you guys.
189920	195720	Um, those of you that stick with us, especially because I know, uh, with the live stuff, um,
195720	199560	and we love our podcast listeners too, please don't get me wrong, but the live folks have
199560	203380	been especially putting up with some crap lately because of all these internet issues
203380	204380	I've been having.
204380	206900	Um, I have bad news and I have good news.
206900	211080	I'm ready to talk about this announcement I've been teasing for a while, which, which
211080	214800	most of you have figured out, but let me start with the bad news.
214800	219560	Um, the bad news is I don't see these internet problems getting fixed anytime soon.
219560	224520	Uh, in fact, I fully expect the internet to crap out at 7 15 Pacific tonight as it did
224520	228840	the last couple of weeks as it's been, uh, throughout the week on my personal connection.
228840	234440	Um, I'm trying, but my cable company doesn't seem to understand what the problem is and
234440	237440	it's, uh, it's getting pretty ridiculous to be quite honest.
237440	241360	Um, so unfortunately I'm not sure much can change with that.
241360	244440	However, uh, we did do some preventative things behind the scenes.
244440	249800	For example, if the show looks a little fuzzier or a little choppier than maybe you're used
249800	252720	to, and this is only for Twitch, this wouldn't affect the podcast at all.
252720	258800	Um, but it's because I purposely did a lower bit rate and only 30 frames a second instead
258800	264440	of 60 to try to push less video out the door so that if there is a hiccup, I'm hoping our
264440	266440	audio will still get through if nothing else.
266440	269960	That is something I was noticing in the past couple episodes in the feed.
269960	273680	It's just the video got really choppy and laggy and you guys could kind of still hear
273680	274680	things.
274680	279920	So I'm hoping maybe making some small changes like that, um, will, uh, help those issues.
279920	280920	So we'll see.
280920	281920	Hopefully, hopefully.
282120	284480	Um, now let's talk about the good news.
284480	291520	The good news is I know that this isn't going to happen beyond February because, um, last
291520	297640	summer Alan and I bought a house and you might be thinking, what is taken?
297640	299880	So don't you usually move into a house the next one?
299880	302000	Well, we bought a new house.
302000	306480	We did things a little differently because, uh, we're not like rich or anything like that.
306480	309120	I don't want you to think it's, it's that sort of situation.
309120	313800	But, um, what happened is that the, the market in real estate was crazy and we were bidding
313800	317760	on houses and getting outbid by, I'm telling you $50,000.
317760	322200	We were, we looked at one house in the pocket, oh my God, it would have been beautiful.
322200	323880	Like it would have been great for us.
323880	329600	It had an upstairs loft that would have made the best studio type of area or like arcade
329600	330600	or something like that.
330600	333760	But unfortunately we got outbid by $50,000 in that place.
333760	335280	So it wasn't meant to be.
335280	338140	Um, however, we got sick of playing that game and you know what?
338160	342280	We found some new construction and we were like, time, time's on our side.
342280	345180	We can wait a little longer and save up and things like that.
345180	347000	And, and let's do, let's do this.
347000	348360	Let's go for the house this way.
348360	353240	So, um, we, we bought some new construction and now the construction is finally finishing.
353240	357520	We've been quiet about it for a long time because, um, out of respect to our current
357520	360560	living situation, we don't know who knows who and things like that.
360560	364740	And just, I'm not wanting to, you know, curse anything or what have you, uh, we just didn't
364740	366980	say anything about it until now.
366980	371980	So the good news with that is that, um, after February, so there's not going to be a show
371980	375020	February 20th, because that'll be the weekend that I'm changing.
375020	382320	Uh, but then after that, uh, there will, um, uh, no longer be the old cable provider that
382320	383320	I use now.
383320	388500	Uh, there's a different fiber internet provider out there and I'm just going to hope it's
388500	390580	a whole lot better experience.
390580	391580	That's for darn sure.
391580	393020	So there is that.
393020	395580	Um, so thank you guys very much for the kind words and chat.
395580	396580	I appreciate that.
396700	397700	Continued bits.
397700	398700	Thank you guys so much.
398700	399700	Oh my gosh.
399700	401140	Really, really appreciate that.
401140	402140	Oh yeah.
402140	405140	You know, and what I love about, and I'm not going to say who the provider is because then
405140	410580	you guys are just going to tell me the, all the negative stuff about that company.
410580	414940	Let me give you, um, this in perspective, there's two companies I can pick from our
414940	417180	current company or this new one.
417180	418480	Which one do you think I'm going with?
418480	420100	No matter what y'all have to say.
420100	422020	Yeah, I'm going with the new one.
422020	423620	Um, but then I see about it.
423620	426060	They don't force a TV package down our throat.
426060	430100	Like it's, it's almost made for people who have cut the cord and it's wonderful.
430100	431820	I'm, I'm so excited about it.
431820	432820	That's for sure.
432820	434300	So, um, yeah, there you go.
434300	435300	That's my big announcement.
435300	436300	I wanted to talk about.
436300	437300	Thank you.
437300	438300	Thank you.
438300	440240	Um, one thing I should address, cause I think people are going to wonder and I think people
440240	443260	have been wondering this for awhile, so I think we should probably bring it up.
443260	447820	Um, and the question, or I guess more of the statement is that, um, the, the thing that's
447820	451780	going to be a little different when, um, Alan and I move into the new house, um, there's
451780	452900	not a studio in it.
452900	457220	Uh, well, fortunately we had to go for a house of a certain size and there's not going to
457220	460100	be a studio in the house.
460100	462340	Um, so there isn't really a studio number eight.
462340	466520	Um, so I guess what I'm trying to say is that for now, uh, OLR is just going to continue
466520	472100	in the virtual form that it has been, um, never say never, I guess, because, you know,
472100	476380	maybe one of the offices can be, I don't, I just don't know how it would work on Twitch,
476380	477640	but never say never.
477640	481980	So I don't want to say like forever, but, um, this is just the way we're going to proceed,
481980	483300	uh, for the future.
483300	486180	Um, you know, and COVID is still a thing too.
486180	489940	You know, um, it's a lot smarter that way, honestly, it, it, yeah.
489940	494000	And like, for example, last night I hosted a show at a theater.
494000	495320	It was a great show.
495320	496500	I had a great time.
496500	501180	Uh, it was a tribute to twin peaks and we actually had, um, like Laura Palmer's actress,
501180	503380	Cheryl Lee was actually there in attendance and so forth.
503380	507540	But obviously doing that and hosting that, even though, you know, I wore a mask and vaccinated,
507540	511860	I took all the precautions and that I tried to minimize my interactions close with people.
511860	513580	I still did a risky thing.
513580	517640	And for that reason, I didn't do anything a few days before I'm not going to do anything
517640	522520	a few days after, just to make sure I'm in the clear with all that stuff with the precautions.
522520	527020	If we had had a show in person tonight, that wouldn't really be the case, right?
527020	530800	Like I could, because I took a risk, I could be exposing the co-host.
530800	534380	So anyway, I think y'all know what I'm getting at is that just for a little while, uh, for
534380	536860	the foreseeable future, we're going to continue this virtual thing.
536860	539580	So, um, and it's been working out.
539580	543580	Um, and things are going to get reconfigured, which I think will be really, so the show's
543580	547700	going to look different in about three weeks because I'm already stewing with some ideas
547700	551340	and I think it will be at the end of the day, really cool.
551340	556400	So please, uh, hang in there, stick with us and thank you for being here.
556400	560020	Let's let's, let's see if we can, let's see if we've got enough gas in the tank to get
560020	561060	to a thousand.
561060	562060	What do you say?
562060	564060	I think we'll do it.
564060	565060	Let's do it.
565060	566620	All right.
566620	567620	Let's start off.
567740	571940	That's our big news, but man, there was some big news in the gaming industry this week.
571940	572940	That's for sure.
572940	577780	News so big, Bobby was like, we got to go live now to talk about this.
577780	580660	I was like, yeah, let's, let's, let's talk about it, but there's still stuff to talk
580660	581660	about.
581660	583160	And I want to talk about it with you all tonight.
583160	586700	So Loki, can you get into the kickoff topic tonight?
586700	587700	Yeah.
587700	592460	So Microsoft decided, Hey, you know how you keep asking us about a relationship with Activision
592460	594860	Blizzard and it's a very touchy subject.
594860	598420	We'll just buy them and make it less awkward or more awkward.
598420	599420	I'm not really sure.
599420	605060	So, um, they decided to purchase or at least they intend on purchasing Activision Blizzard
605060	607020	for $70 billion.
607020	609900	Uh, that also include King as well.
609900	614760	So Microsoft will own all of the franchises at that point.
614760	621140	And then, um, yeah, so it's, it is probably one of the largest purchases that, you know,
621140	624200	it's been made in the video game industry, I think.
624840	626680	It's the part that I thought was fascinating.
626680	631600	It's doesn't make Microsoft the biggest company still, it is still behind Sony and Tencent,
631600	632600	which I think is interesting.
632600	633600	Yeah.
633600	639280	So, um, but still though, I mean, they're, they have quite the, the catalog now, um,
639280	642080	right now there's still a lot up in the air.
642080	646800	They basically done this, they've kind of said the same things that they did with Bethesda
646800	651320	where it's like, okay, yeah, we're going to go ahead and honor our agreements that were
651320	655160	in place already, you know, with like call of duty and stuff like that.
655160	663080	So they'll be coming to multiple systems for now, um, in the future, maybe not.
663080	664080	We'll see.
664080	669560	Um, but yeah, it'd be interesting to see maybe if they bring like some of these titles that
669560	674520	aren't necessarily on Xbox to Xbox, like world of Warcraft or something like that.
674520	680900	Um, but we also see, of course, them planning on bringing Activision Blizzard games to game
680940	686940	pass, which really is probably the end game with this anyways, it's just adding a ton
686940	692620	of, ton more content to, uh, games pass in general.
692620	696860	And you know, there's been obviously some questions like, is Bobby Kotick going to still
696860	699500	be on board for this right now?
699500	700500	Yes.
700500	704260	But I'm not sure after the deal closes, if he will stay, I think they are probably going
704260	705260	to let him go.
706260	712060	A lot of the stuff that's come out later in the week, Loki is, um, pretty much the plan
712060	717420	is that there is no plan for Bobby Kotick after the deal is closed, but they do have
717420	721640	to close the deal because, you know, there's going to be, I'm sure regulators are going
721640	727420	to look at, look at this hell one representative, I think it was Jerry Nadler, um, already kind
727420	731980	of wrote a tweet about, you know, this sounds like it could be, you know, it needs to go
731980	734260	under the microscope and this whole thing.
734260	736500	Oh, this already talks about antitrust.
736500	739540	Oh, Dark Sakura, not all reps feel this way, right?
739540	746340	Well, I mean, the, uh, I even hate saying her name, but, uh, Marjorie Taylor Greene
746340	752180	sold $15,000 worth of stock the day Microsoft announced that they were going to buy the
752180	753180	company.
753180	755340	We'll just refer to that one as her.
755340	756340	Her.
756340	757340	Um, which.
757340	762340	They shouldn't be trading stocks in the first place, but that's a whole other thing.
762340	772060	Well, um, that resulted in, since their stock went up that day, that was, I mean, it didn't
772060	776020	go up a whole lot, but that gave her about another 200 bucks in capital gains.
776020	782100	So, um, the thing is, is that, I mean, if they're going to get Martha Stewart for this,
782100	787740	they need to be looking at her next, just saying she had to have known something.
788620	793780	But I, it's, I just don't see this getting stopped for antitrust.
793780	798220	I mean, I'm not also a legal mind, so I'm not going to try to be an armchair critic
798220	803100	in that regard, but I just, you know, again, Microsoft is not going to be the biggest company
803100	804220	in this regard.
804220	808220	We know that there's going to be at least two others that are still bigger, um, and
808220	809220	it'd be different.
809220	815300	Like if they purchase Sony or purchase like Nintendo, that would be a little bit, yeah.
815300	822340	I mean, the, the, I think the theory that Microsoft goes down a meta route where you
822340	828460	have Microsoft and then Xbox game studios is its own separate company under Microsoft.
828460	833740	That is probably the closest thing to a, how this plays out that I think it may ultimately
833740	834740	end up.
834740	840820	Um, I've also like, there was the topic that came up that sometimes companies will offload
840820	843580	part of the sale in order to help it go through.
843580	847700	Um, and an excellent example was brought up in the bonus stream we did earlier in the
847700	855060	week where, um, when Disney bought Fox, which was kind of this in the entertainment world,
855060	856060	right?
856060	861180	When Disney bought Fox, uh, they had to unload the Fox sports channels because it was going
861180	865780	to create like a sports monopoly probably because of whatever ABC has and that whole
865780	866780	mess.
866780	867780	So they had to unload that.
867780	870300	They have like ESPN or something like that.
870300	871740	Yeah, I think it's something around that.
871740	874140	So it would have created some type of like sports monopoly.
874140	879380	So the thought was that, well, maybe like if anything seems like it's spin off-able
879380	883140	from ABK, it feels like it's King.
883140	885180	And I'm not saying that King is bad.
885180	888500	Please do not hear me say, I'm not saying they're expendable or that I'm not, that's
888500	890020	not what I'm saying.
890020	894580	But what I'm saying is that what I believe Microsoft really wants is the A and B side
894580	902560	of things because Microsoft's mobile strategy seems to be game pass, the cloud, that kind
902560	903560	of gaming.
903560	904980	That's their mobile strategy.
904980	908860	I'm not sure, and I may be wrong and that's fine.
908860	913140	I'm not sure a mobile developer is what they really want.
913140	917380	And maybe if they kind of unload that, then it's not going to give the perception that
917380	921940	Microsoft has some weird, or they're going for a mobile thing, which they, which when
921940	926680	the Windows phone is no longer a thing, I don't see as an issue anyway.
926680	932480	So I actually, I don't know if King gets offloaded because I'm not sure Microsoft having a mobile
932480	934140	developer means anything.
934140	938380	All of their, all of their opportunities in mobile have flopped.
938380	940620	And I think now it's about cloud gaming.
940620	942940	So we'll see.
942940	946540	Some other comments in chat about what gets spun off.
946540	952180	Rama points out when Walgreens bought Rite Aid, they had to unload half the stores for
952180	955620	similar reasons, but thank God they kept thrifty ice cream.
955620	958220	I added that part because that's the most important.
958220	959220	That's the most important.
959220	963500	Well, yeah, I don't think, well, they don't have that in all locations, but I know like
963500	966780	the one we have over here in Folsom mentions thrifty ice cream.
966780	969980	They still have thrifty ice cream counters in Sacramento, which is great and probably
969980	971140	some other parts in Orkal.
971140	972140	It's great.
972140	973140	Yeah.
973140	974140	There was one by Matt.
974140	975140	I haven't been to one of those and well, yeah.
975740	979700	I could give, I could give fuck all where my pills come from as long as I get thrifty
979700	980700	ice cream.
980700	981700	That's all.
981700	982700	Let's see.
982700	987220	Pod culture is talking about Sprint and T-Mobile had to unload some stuff for that to happen.
987220	993160	And DJ Rama says that was Boost Mobile, the Dish Network and shut down Virgin Mobile.
993160	999180	So I can tell you quite a bit about that first hand, right.
999180	1006160	And then Boost went to.
1006160	1007160	It was Dish.
1007160	1009100	Yeah, Boost went to Dish.
1009100	1013900	And then they're still under and then they went off to T-Mobile.
1013900	1018980	So there was a sort of a big series of transitions with that.
1018980	1026640	And we may see something weird where some of Activision Studios get spun off.
1026640	1033080	We may, I mean, we could, I don't want to sound too tinfoil hatty, but I could see a
1033080	1037920	situation where Blizzard gets spun off into an independent thing again or get sold to
1037920	1038920	someone else.
1038920	1040740	I could see that.
1040740	1046740	I don't think that makes sense with Microsoft strategy, but I could see it.
1046740	1049720	I don't think anything should be off the table in that regard.
1049720	1052880	So anyway.
1052880	1058980	So yeah, Loki, any other headlines from this whole thing, because this has been nonstop
1058980	1062960	headlines all week on this.
1062960	1068780	There's been a lot of like kind of asking for comment regarding basically just the work
1068780	1074720	situation that Activision Blizzard employees are kind of a part of right now.
1074720	1080800	And they kind of just been shrugging it off, especially when we're talking about unionization,
1080800	1085520	which I know we'll get into that a little bit later, but basically saying that they're
1085520	1094080	not trying to come across as experts in what's going on with unions, but I don't know.
1094080	1096680	So we'll see.
1096680	1102880	I'm hoping with Microsoft kind of overseeing them now that conditions will be better.
1102880	1105600	So we'll hopefully see that happening.
1105600	1110420	I'm not going to profess to know exactly what those employees are going through, but I will
1110420	1116340	venture a guess that the attitude may be one of, could it get any like, at least it
1116340	1122500	won't get any worse or like could Microsoft buying us be any worse than where we were
1122500	1123500	going?
1123500	1128060	Well, yeah, I think, well, if they do get rid of Bobby Kotick, I think that's going
1128060	1133100	to be a good sign that they're kind of trying to right the ship of it.
1133100	1135780	So we'll see what happens.
1135780	1136840	Only time will tell.
1136840	1138380	I don't really know what the work culture.
1138380	1142060	I mean, I can only imagine that work culture in like Microsoft or something like that is
1142060	1143240	better.
1143240	1146940	I don't think it, we haven't heard a lot of stories coming out of Microsoft.
1146940	1151020	I'm sure there's crunch and stuff like that still, but we haven't heard of anything like
1151020	1152020	bad.
1152020	1153020	Yeah.
1153020	1158840	Well, DJ Ramis in our chat says, as a former Microsoft employee, I can tell you firsthand
1158840	1161760	that Microsoft will take care of you as an employee, seriously.
1161760	1166380	And I think generally, I think the industry regards Phil Spencer pretty highly and what
1166380	1168580	he's done for Xbox.
1168580	1175060	And I think things feel, you know, will be like the fact that it will be him running
1175060	1181260	that and not Bobby Kotick does give me some warm fuzzies.
1181260	1187100	The part that gives me cold pricklies is that Bobby Kotick is going to get like a quarter
1187100	1189060	of a billion dollar payout when he leaves.
1189060	1191920	If all this, I mean, nobody really knows the terms of the deal.
1191920	1194700	And I know there's stuff that's around the Internet about the contracts and stuff that
1194700	1199420	I think are from a year ago though, but still, it's very clear he will get some very large
1199420	1201060	payout when he goes.
1201060	1204860	And that sucks because it feels like the bad guy's winning.
1204860	1208060	He shouldn't get shit like, like let's be honest.
1208060	1209580	How did this even happen?
1209580	1214200	How is, I mean, this, when I saw the headline, when I woke up, which is funny, cause I slept
1214200	1216620	in on Tuesday cause I actually had the day off.
1216620	1224040	And when I woke up, I was like, you know, that wasn't on my 2022 bingo card for gaming.
1224040	1229560	It wasn't in the prediction jar that we did here on OLR last week, but it really should
1229560	1230560	have been.
1230560	1236360	Like when I, when I kind of heard that, I was like, you know, I'm not surprised.
1236360	1242200	Like we, we kind of knew Activision Blizzard was fucked and they knew it.
1242200	1247600	And, and you hear these stories about they were trying to offload the company in November.
1247600	1252700	Well first they were going to buy this, this is the part that blows my mind.
1252700	1258860	They were trying to buy a company like Kotaku or GamesRadar to change the narrative.
1258860	1262920	And I don't know if that was about like that they wanted to buy a company to get other
1262920	1267760	types of stories published about the company or no, literally they are buying the, the
1267760	1272020	journalistic things to write different stories.
1272020	1274980	That part is like, you know, kind of thing.
1274980	1275980	Obviously it didn't happen.
1275980	1280820	Let's focus on that versus actually making positive change.
1280820	1283540	And again, look at who writes our textbooks.
1283540	1284540	Yeah.
1284540	1287540	Well, it's a, it's a common, common, common tactic.
1287540	1288540	Yeah.
1288540	1291120	It's, it's, uh, it's, so that's, that was interesting at all.
1291120	1294740	But then, uh, they want their own revisionist history.
1294740	1298380	Activision Blizzard went to other suitors because I think when they realized Microsoft
1298380	1301420	made a deal, they wanted to see if somebody else will give them more money.
1301420	1306060	And it's known that, um, Facebook meta is one of the other suitors they talked to.
1306060	1308420	Thank, thank God that didn't happen.
1308420	1309700	Can we all take a look?
1310700	1315940	I don't care if you're the biggest, I don't care if you're the biggest Sony fanboy and
1315940	1320460	you hate everything that Microsoft does and says and breeze, which I think, I think is
1320460	1321460	silly in the first place.
1321460	1325180	And I would say the exact same thing about vice versa, um, because I, I definitely know
1325180	1329540	those people that are vice versa and it's, it's, it's ridiculous.
1329540	1335780	But uh, here's the thing, as much as you can hate Microsoft with every fiber of your being,
1335780	1338940	it still could have been worse.
1338940	1341620	Like can you imagine if meta had bought Activision?
1341620	1345980	Like I would have, I don't know what I would have done.
1345980	1347580	I would have, I would have been so upset.
1347580	1351740	I think, I think, I think tonight would have been a night of mourning, uh, for sure.
1351740	1355140	Uh, and we don't know who the third suitor was.
1355140	1365740	I would speculate a Google Stadia question mark or, or an Amazon.
1365740	1368860	I would, well, that doesn't mean, but that doesn't mean Activision didn't try to start
1368860	1369860	conversation.
1369860	1374820	I would speculate a Google or an Amazon where that was the other suitor, but I, at the end
1374820	1375820	of the day, I don't know.
1375820	1377300	So, and neither do you.
1377300	1381820	So um, Bobby Black will suggest Tencent.
1381820	1384760	Well, didn't Tencent get that stake in Ubisoft?
1384760	1387220	So I kind of feel like Tencent is making moves other places.
1387220	1392540	I mean, maybe, uh, yeah, but I, I Google and Amazon are the two I'm, I'm thinking of.
1392540	1398100	So so what do you all think of this at the end of the day?
1398100	1404220	What do you, do you, do you, cause I, I, I do see the arguments that gaming is becoming
1404220	1405300	too big.
1405300	1411020	It's becoming these gigantic monolith companies and so forth, but I'm also of the mindset
1411020	1416780	that particularly when it comes to Activision Blizzard, something had to change.
1416780	1419740	The dam was going to burst.
1419740	1425060	That company was literally being run into the ground by horrible mismanagement and people
1425060	1428020	were abandoning ship left and right.
1428020	1429940	Something had to happen.
1429940	1435100	And I, you know, even though I, I definitely hear and I understand the whole like gaming
1435100	1441640	monolith thing, I, Bobby Kotick is to blame and set that company up for this to happen.
1441640	1446800	I don't see how else I, it was that or they, they go bankrupt.
1446800	1450580	Like they, they, they're getting bought out one way or another.
1450580	1455580	Any thoughts from y'all on your thoughts on this whole purchase?
1455580	1457380	I don't care how much Kotick gets paid.
1457380	1463620	I want him gone to not have to hear about him again would make me happy.
1463620	1466540	I can't stand how he's trying to change the narrative either.
1466540	1470400	Like he was interviewed for something and he was like, well, why do you think the stock
1470400	1471400	has gone down?
1471400	1477020	And you know, of course, instead of talking about him because of him, well, which I logically
1477020	1479980	know nobody's going to say, oh, it's my fault.
1479980	1485860	Um, although, although don't we remember about three months ago when Final Fantasy
1485860	1492280	14 and Walker was having issues and Yoshi P got up there and said, I apologize.
1492280	1497100	Wasn't that the most refreshing fucking thing to ever happen in the gaming industry?
1497100	1499100	I apologize.
1499100	1500100	Yes.
1500100	1501500	You gotta taking a pay cut.
1501500	1504460	I'm sorry.
1504700	1507540	What a refreshing fucking perspective.
1507540	1513700	But Bobby Kotick, no, no, no says, well, with Diablo 4 getting delayed and Overwatch 2 getting
1513700	1521820	delayed and Call of Duty not being up to expectation, whose fucking fault is that, dummy?
1521820	1524780	And I'm glad he's getting called the fuck out for it.
1524780	1528820	That Overwatch producer, I don't know if it was current or former on Twitter that basically
1528820	1532540	called him the fuck out and was like, what?
1532540	1537060	Overwatch 2 is, is getting put off because you've been putting us on crunch projects
1537060	1539060	that have gone nowhere.
1539060	1540260	Call him out.
1540260	1544820	And I, at least I will say this and dark soccer, I, I would think you would agree, but let
1544820	1545820	me know.
1545820	1550900	Thank God the media is calling him out on that bullshit and not letting him dictate
1550900	1553540	the narrative.
1553540	1555380	They have to, they have to combat it.
1555380	1558140	I mean, like, no, you're, you're wrong.
1558140	1561180	It's totally your fault and we're going to hold, you know, we're going to nail your ass
1561180	1562180	on it.
1562180	1563180	Yeah.
1563180	1564420	So he, not even in a good way.
1564420	1569620	He may get a $200 million payout, but you know what he won't get is his dignity and
1569620	1570620	his reputation.
1570620	1571620	Shit.
1571620	1575980	I wish that the day he, you know what, y'all, y'all, y'all, here we go.
1575980	1576980	Here we go.
1576980	1578900	This is how I want to open OLR.
1578900	1579900	The week Bobby.
1579900	1580900	Okay.
1580900	1581900	Y'all with me?
1581900	1582900	Y'all with me?
1582900	1585980	Cause it's going to require costumes and props, costumes and props.
1586020	1589020	The week Bobby Kotick is gone.
1589020	1594300	I want us to start the show and I want us all to have our bells and I want us to go
1594300	1603340	shame, shame, shame with our bells while Bobby Kotick leaves this industry forever.
1603340	1605300	And we shame him into the night.
1605300	1608540	Sound good?
1608540	1611140	I mean, I have better things I could cosplay.
1611140	1614820	Honestly, Rob, it's not worth it.
1614820	1616220	I don't care about him.
1616220	1619500	I just don't want to acknowledge his existence anymore.
1619500	1621140	He's going to be crying into his $320 million.
1621140	1625620	I don't want to give him any attention.
1625620	1632540	I want him to fade out into obscurity as a stinky shit stain on video game history.
1632540	1637820	But there, there, there isn't a little part of you that wants to be there and start yelling
1637820	1643060	muck, scum, rabbit droppings.
1643060	1645580	There isn't a little part of you.
1645580	1653020	I don't want to give a piece of shit like that.
1653020	1655740	Any energy is not worth my energy.
1655740	1656740	I get it.
1656740	1657740	I get it.
1657740	1658740	All right, Loki.
1658740	1659740	What about?
1659740	1660740	Oh, sorry.
1660740	1665740	I can take that energy and put it into combating people like him.
1665740	1666740	Fair enough.
1666740	1670180	So maybe your final thought on this whole Activision Blizzard thing, and is this a good
1670180	1671180	thing or not?
1671180	1675540	Yeah, I think it's a good thing because they, I mean, maybe at least they'll, you know,
1675540	1679340	up the quality of certain titles that they put out.
1679340	1685420	It's been just a mess with like Call of Duty and stuff, but I don't know, we'll see.
1685420	1687540	All right, let's move on.
1687540	1690800	I'm sure this is going to be a developing story and we're going to hear a lot about
1690800	1696140	this over the next year as, you know, it starts to get looked at under a magnifying glass.
1696140	1700940	I will give a quick plug because I talked at length with Bobby for like an hour or 15
1700940	1704340	minutes earlier this week, and that video, it's up on YouTube.
1704340	1708940	So if you're a subscriber here at Twitch TV, you can see it in the Twitch archives, but
1708940	1712380	we decided, you know what, let's put this one up on YouTube on the house so you can
1712380	1716460	see that on our YouTube as well over at Channel VOG Network.
1716460	1720940	We don't use our YouTube for a lot, so I'm going to point you in that direction to check
1720940	1721940	that one out.
1721940	1722940	So there you go.
1722940	1723940	All right.
1723940	1728260	Odigerama S says, open the show with celebration by cooling the game.
1728260	1733420	That's a DMCA violation and cost more money than he's worth.
1733420	1739580	In theory, I'm with your brother, but in execution, we can't.
1739580	1742380	All right, let's move on.
1742380	1747360	Let's shift the conversation away from idiot CEOs to more important people, us, and talk
1747360	1751000	about our gaming weeks and the types of games we have been playing this week.
1751000	1752260	So let me go to Dark Sakura.
1752260	1753260	How was your gaming week?
1753700	1754700	You want to guess?
1754700	1761580	I'm going to say Dead by Daylight, Fantasian, Word Scramble.
1761580	1764940	Have you gotten on the Wordle train yet?
1764940	1767020	No, and I'm not going to.
1767020	1769300	It's fine.
1769300	1771580	It's inoffensive.
1771580	1772780	I like Wordle.
1772780	1777500	I like that it's one a day and I don't like everyone freaking posting their little weird
1777500	1780500	square things that make zero sense to anybody else.
1780500	1781500	Yeah, it does.
1781500	1786140	It does seem a little bit cultish and I'm guilty of posting it, but I think that's kind
1786140	1789860	of the brilliance of it in a weird way.
1789860	1796940	I am perfectly happy with the games that I play.
1796940	1802340	I actually did some screwing around, so I have a VHS key.
1802340	1804940	Oh, yeah, that's right.
1804940	1810300	I heard you were trying to get that working on your Mac, so you cracked the code and got
1810300	1811940	a key to VHS, huh?
1811940	1822540	To tell you how it happened, I happened to give somebody a sub in a mutual friend's chat.
1822540	1825580	I'm trying not to get anybody in trouble.
1825580	1831500	And that mutual friend had met through playing VHS.
1831500	1837060	And I was like, yeah, I've messaged the VHS devs to see if they have any information about
1837060	1838860	this running in Parallels and everything.
1838860	1840940	And the person messages me is like, do you want to code?
1840940	1843220	I'm like, yes, I want to code.
1843220	1845180	So I have a code.
1845180	1849340	And we should say we should say because not everybody's just going to know VHS.
1849340	1851300	We're not talking about the old 80s videotape.
1851300	1856260	We're talking about a game, which that's the vibe that another asymmetrical game, but it's
1856260	1859020	a bit different than it's a bit different than it by the way.
1859020	1860020	Yeah.
1860020	1866020	Not not gore and horror, but more cheesy play as teenagers trapped in 80s VHS, you know,
1866020	1871780	direct-to-video slasher flicks, but like gremlins slasher flicks, like not actually gory.
1871780	1872780	Yeah.
1872780	1875460	And you have to kill the monster or before the monster kills you.
1875460	1884380	So so anyway, I I got the game to run.
1884380	1889960	Now the problem being is that every time I go into the tutorial so that I can practice
1889960	1895740	playing the game, I have the eternal loading screen and the loading screen has full animation.
1895740	1899740	You know, I wonder what would happen if I just left it to run overnight so the game
1899740	1905260	will run and I don't really have too many problems getting it to that point until I
1905260	1906800	try to get into the tutorial.
1906800	1913580	It will even cue me for a match, but I can't I haven't let it stay in queue.
1913580	1917260	I don't want to start playing the game and then have it not work on me while I'm in a
1917260	1921140	match and then screw everybody else over.
1921140	1926140	So I am letting another friend use my account.
1926140	1931780	Another streamer friend who has, you know, said is hiding, hiding my username, hiding
1931780	1932780	everything.
1932780	1937220	No one's going to get in trouble, special password and everything, but at least someone
1937220	1942220	gets to enjoy the game for a little bit that wouldn't have otherwise enjoyed it.
1942220	1948420	So but I can tell you right now when I think the virtualization for Windows 11 ARM gets
1948420	1952540	better, I think VHS is going to have no problem running.
1952540	1955340	So keep giving the feedback to the devs.
1955340	1957140	That's what betas are for.
1957140	1959420	You know, that's what I'm doing.
1959420	1964980	That being said, since I had to reinstall my virtual, I basically had to recreate my
1964980	1968180	virtual machine and reinstall Windows 11.
1968180	1973900	I'm now going to see if I can get Mass Effect to work because it's running a lot better
1973900	1975540	than it was.
1975540	1977380	So I've reinstalled Mass Effect.
1977380	1981500	I haven't started running it or anything.
1981500	1984700	I did also make another discovery because now I've just sort of been playing around
1984700	1989860	with different things behind the scenes is that Dead by Daylight will run on Windows
1989860	1990860	ARM.
1990860	1995500	What doesn't run is the anti-cheat.
1995500	2001300	Easy anti-cheat won't run, which is funny because VHS uses that too.
2001300	2005380	But I have no idea what the difference is, why the launcher and everything is working
2005380	2008620	there but the one for Dead by Daylight isn't.
2008620	2013140	The only thing is that when I load Dead by Daylight directly, in absence of the anti-cheat,
2013140	2019180	then it doesn't think I'm online for Steam.
2019180	2027700	That being said, I am now shopping around for a graphics card to try to get my old PC
2027700	2035140	rebuilt, thankfully with some parts that a good friend was kind enough to gift me.
2035140	2036140	Thank you.
2036140	2043580	I just need a better graphics card for it and to give it another go.
2043580	2047420	So we're gonna see.
2047420	2051260	But yeah, I've been doing a lot more stuff with other games, not necessarily playing
2051260	2056740	them, but working on getting them to work in the background.
2056740	2061380	I don't know if I have anything that would be helpful, but if you need PC parts, I'm
2061380	2064540	gonna be dismantling the old show PC because it serves no purpose.
2064540	2066660	It's not gonna have what I want.
2066660	2067660	It's way too much.
2067660	2068660	Thought I'd try.
2068660	2069660	Thought I'd try.
2069660	2070660	But thank you.
2070660	2071660	Yeah.
2071660	2072660	All right.
2072660	2073660	Well, let's move on.
2073660	2075300	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2075300	2079580	It was all Minecraft, as usual.
2079580	2081500	I did find something funny though.
2081500	2087060	So I mean, it was bound to happen sooner or later, but there's been some let's plays
2087060	2093100	being put up for Pixel Poops number two on YouTube, one of which I saw that he really
2093100	2097700	hated it.
2097700	2099500	But yeah, I had good points.
2099500	2104380	But like, obviously, being the one that made it like, I understand why I couldn't do certain
2104380	2105380	things they want.
2105380	2109500	Also, like playing with a turbo controller uses too easy, like, yeah, because you're
2109500	2112780	playing as a turbo controller, you idiot.
2112780	2114580	But it's fine.
2114580	2116900	Not everybody's gonna like it.
2116900	2117900	Let me ask you this.
2117900	2122620	We're celebrating 900 episodes tonight and a 20 year history of this show.
2122620	2128180	And sometimes, Loki, I think you're viewed as the critical one, especially when it comes
2128180	2129740	to things like Nintendo and so forth.
2129740	2134260	We've talked at length about how a lot of that does come from a place of love, ultimately.
2134260	2138940	But you're the first to be critical about a video game and its flaws and so forth.
2138940	2144500	Now it sounds like the tables might be turned a little bit and you're kind of hearing and
2144500	2149500	you know, in the back of your mind, well, what this reviewer is talking about are limitations
2149500	2150500	of the hardware.
2150500	2152540	I can't do the things they're asking for.
2152540	2157100	Does it change your perspective at all in talking about games this way?
2157100	2158860	It's more expectations too.
2158860	2162980	Like they have like the game, the purpose of the game is supposed to be like a simple
2162980	2164060	arcade game.
2164060	2167940	So like, they're like, well, the game plays all the same through all the levels.
2167940	2173620	I'm like, yeah, but haven't you played like Pac-Man or Mr. Do or like any of these like
2173620	2179340	old 80s arcade games where, yeah, the gameplay is going to be the same across all the levels.
2179340	2181640	It doesn't change throughout the thing.
2181640	2184780	And so it's just the expectations that they have.
2184780	2188580	Some of the things they had good points like, like, why isn't there an enemy, like, say
2188580	2193040	that jumps over one of the poops and then, you know, you have to put two in a row or
2193040	2194040	something like that.
2194040	2196500	And like, yes, I did consider stuff like that.
2196500	2200300	The problem is because their behavior is very random.
2200300	2206120	If you put that, if you have an enemy like that and they're near the end of the screen
2206120	2210580	and you put down like something to try to trap them and they jump over off the screen,
2210580	2212740	it seems unfair to the player.
2212740	2217260	And so there's like a lot of things I couldn't do because it would be, it would seem unfair
2217260	2221420	because there'd be no way to combat it because it's just the enemy behavior.
2221420	2223340	But like it, yeah, I understand that.
2223340	2226980	But also at the same time, they're like, well, I didn't like it cause it's too easy.
2226980	2230520	And like, yeah, you see him play at the turbo controller and then you just like build the
2230520	2232980	entire screens like, okay, and I got nothing to do.
2232980	2238680	But normally if you play with a turbo controller, it's very frantic and it's that.
2238680	2240620	So he's missing something with that.
2240620	2241620	It's fine.
2241620	2242620	Like whatever, you know,
2242620	2245420	I'm glad you have a measured approach to the feedback of nothing else.
2245420	2248940	Like you're, I'm glad you have, cause honestly, Loki, I would normally tell you, and you know
2248940	2251860	this, don't read the comments section.
2251860	2253460	Don't watch these YouTube's nothing.
2253460	2257460	It's only going to demotivate you, but at least it sounds like you kind of, you know,
2257460	2260340	you're, you're approaching this with the whole, like, okay, it is what it is.
2260340	2264060	And like, there's some things that is not going to please this guy, but he had a point
2264060	2265260	here or there.
2265260	2267900	And I'll think about that, you know, with future games.
2267900	2273460	Like I, and I get it, like if the hardware stuff or even maybe necessarily my coding
2273460	2280000	skills or whatever were, you know, there's probably ways you can cram more stuff in there,
2280000	2281540	but like I just couldn't.
2281540	2285340	I just, I just didn't want, I don't want these YouTube's and I don't think they are,
2285340	2286340	but I need to say it.
2286340	2289140	I don't want these YouTube's to discourage you from doing another.
2289140	2295700	Oh no, no, no, no, no, it's, it's, it's just like, no, it's only one person that doesn't
2295700	2296700	like it.
2296700	2299300	And it's well, I don't like it either.
2299300	2300300	No, I'm just kidding.
2300300	2301300	I think it's fine.
2301300	2302300	You know, I love it.
2302300	2305580	To be fair and say, it's not like somebody, like they didn't give it a good shot.
2305580	2309140	Like he played like two hours worth of the game and I get it.
2309140	2310140	Yeah.
2310740	2315820	Especially if you're playing with, like I said, turbo controller, um, because he says
2315820	2317280	his controller is breaking.
2317280	2320340	So that's why he had to play with the turbo or something like that.
2320340	2321820	Turn the turbo off.
2321820	2322820	Exactly.
2322820	2327260	Well, I think he, I think he had like a controller that has like, you know, turbo way and then
2327260	2332620	regular a, and so his a button was broken, so he had to play through whatever, but like,
2332620	2337140	so some of that is his fault, but some of that is, yeah, it's just the way the game
2337140	2338140	is.
2338140	2339140	Yeah.
2339140	2340140	I get it.
2340140	2342940	Like some of the complaints were valid criticisms.
2342940	2344860	Well, did he say anything good?
2344860	2348860	Like the music's good or it's no, he got tired of the music too, because he's all, it's
2348860	2350700	the same songs over and over again.
2350700	2355940	It's like, yeah, I only have limited space to put audio, but like, it's fine.
2355940	2358620	So whatever, you're not going to please everybody.
2358620	2359620	It's fine.
2359620	2360620	That's true.
2360620	2361620	He bought the game.
2361620	2362620	He played it for a couple of hours.
2362620	2365180	I was going to say at the end of the day, did you give him a code?
2365180	2366180	Nope.
2366180	2367180	Then he bought it and you got his money.
2367220	2368220	Bought a copy of the game.
2368220	2369220	So that's fine.
2369220	2370220	Yeah.
2370220	2371220	It's completely fine.
2371220	2372220	You know what?
2372220	2373220	You know, you can't please everybody.
2373220	2374220	That's right.
2374220	2375220	Perfectly fine.
2375220	2378220	It kind of, it's funny to me because it almost sounds like the reverse is happening where
2378220	2382900	it's like you get his perspective as the cynical gamer.
2382900	2387020	You're like, whatever I get it from his, it's kind of funny.
2387020	2388020	All right.
2388020	2391340	Um, my gaming week, uh, pretty much a lot of the same old stuff.
2391340	2392340	Final Fantasy 14.
2392340	2394380	I got my bard to level 90.
2394380	2395900	So another max level character.
2395900	2400220	Uh, I've also been playing, um, dead by daylight here and there.
2400220	2401860	Uh, I die damage.
2401860	2404620	I got my Cheryl to prestige three.
2404620	2408500	So that's the first character that I've actually gone through the blood web the most number
2408500	2410540	of times you can and prestige three.
2410540	2412180	So that was, I guess, the achievement.
2412180	2413180	Yeah.
2413180	2415980	So I have my, I'm actually close to getting my Freddie to prestige too.
2415980	2416980	Oh, cool.
2416980	2417980	Cool.
2417980	2420220	I haven't even prestige one, any killer.
2420220	2423340	So by the way, before I forget, I did get pig adept.
2423340	2424900	Oh, congrats.
2424900	2425900	That's a hard one to get.
2425900	2429100	Uh, it was, but I was on my game that night.
2429100	2432500	I didn't mean to interrupt, but I had to say, no, I was going to say, and I know the tone
2432500	2437060	that starts on Tuesday, I think is all about saw and pig pig and tap.
2437060	2439120	So maybe you'll get some cosmetics out of that.
2439120	2440120	So did you see though?
2440120	2441120	The preview picture?
2441120	2442120	Yeah, I did.
2442120	2443120	I saw your, your tweet.
2443120	2446980	It was like, please let this be a cosmetic and it is, it has to be a cosmetic.
2446980	2452020	It has to, I've been checking schema's channel, the guy who does all of the leak renders and
2452020	2455460	everything and I haven't seen anything on there yet.
2455460	2456940	So I'm just crossing my fingers.
2456940	2461500	We should be pretty close to, to the public test of the ring new chapter.
2461500	2462620	That's pretty exciting too.
2462620	2463620	So we'll see.
2463620	2464620	All right.
2464620	2465620	Anyway.
2465620	2468260	Um, also one of the thing I want to mention on my gaming week though is, um, no man's
2468260	2473240	sky, which I know I play a lot, but I did something very special in no man's sky because
2473240	2476140	there's no, um, expedition going on now.
2476140	2478300	The, the repeats all finished.
2478300	2481620	So if you, you missed expedition one, two, three, four, sorry.
2481620	2483220	They've come and gone again.
2483220	2485060	And so you're not going to be able to do them.
2485060	2487060	Uh, and right now there is no expedition.
2487060	2491420	I am assuming expedition five is waiting in the wings for whatever the next patch ends
2491420	2493040	up being for no man's sky.
2493040	2496220	So in the interim, I was like, you know what, I should work on some achievements.
2496220	2499700	And there's one staring me in the face is the hardest achievement in the entire game
2499700	2504700	because it's get to the center of the galaxy, which is basically beating the game.
2504700	2510640	Although spoiler alert, all it does, it starts you in a new galaxy.
2510640	2511640	That's it.
2511640	2512640	That's the end of the game.
2512640	2517480	So, um, but it's, it's, you know, that's not, you know, the point is exploration and all
2517480	2518480	that.
2518480	2523300	So I don't, I don't judge it for that, but, um, I, you have to get to the center of the
2523300	2525620	galaxy on permadeath.
2525620	2530580	And not only is it permadeath, but permadeath is twice as hard as regular mode.
2530580	2533060	Your life bars deplete twice as fast.
2533060	2538420	You can only hold stacks of 250, not 999, like a normal mode.
2538420	2539420	It is a lot harder.
2539420	2543480	And I will tell you, when I first started permadeath mode, I died in five minutes on
2543480	2544600	the first planet.
2544600	2548940	But I will also tell you this, the hardest part of permadeath mode is getting off the
2548940	2553520	first planet, because right as soon as your game starts, the clock's ticking and you've
2553520	2559280	got to be able to find sodium and oxygen fast, and you have to know, or a cave opening.
2559280	2562060	And some planets are just not going to be as friendly as others.
2562060	2566360	So my first planet, I died in less than five minutes.
2566360	2571340	Second one, I got that inertia going where I got to my ship, was able to fix the ship.
2571340	2572340	Okay.
2572340	2577140	I can make stacks and stacks of life support gels and ion batteries.
2577140	2578940	And I was good after that.
2578940	2579940	And guess what?
2579940	2583500	I got the achievement for getting to the center of the galaxy in permadeath.
2583500	2589540	I did cheese it a little bit, um, because I just kept going to the space anomaly, the
2589540	2595140	multiplayer hub over and over until I saw a base that said, uh, center of the galaxy.
2595140	2599420	And I finally found one that said end of galaxy one green system.
2599420	2604680	And I went to it and sure enough, a good Judy had built a base and a green system at the
2604680	2606000	edge of the galaxy.
2606000	2608120	And I was one jump away from the center of the galaxy.
2608120	2610120	So I did cheese it a little bit.
2610120	2615720	However, I still think to get to that point, I mean, you still have to go through a big
2615720	2616960	chunk of the story.
2616960	2618360	You have to get the space anomaly.
2618360	2622560	You have to build your first warp cell, and you're doing all this in permadeath mode with
2622560	2627040	limited stacks where you can't just stack carbon and ferrite dust to your heart's content.
2627040	2629200	So it was challenging.
2629200	2632020	And so I'm still going to pat myself on the back a little bit.
2632020	2637500	And according to the Xbox statistics, only 0.11% of players have unlocked that achievement.
2637500	2640040	So one in a thousand have gotten that achievement.
2640040	2644420	So I've officially reached galaxy brain level of no man's sky.
2644420	2645420	And it feels great.
2645420	2648860	Now I just need to go clean up a couple other non permadeath achievements that are just
2648860	2649860	grinds.
2649860	2650860	And that's what I'll do next.
2650860	2654220	I will have my full thousand out of a thousand.
2654220	2660560	So Bobby Black Wolf, it is possible to end your achievement score in zero.
2660560	2663760	Just so you know, you just you have to get them all.
2663760	2666760	And that's what I intend to do.
2666760	2672960	So but yeah, you all know I love that game and what it's become over the last five years.
2672960	2674940	So that was a very meaningful achievement to get.
2674940	2679320	And I'm sure I will get really verklempt when I get that Xbox equivalent of platinum.
2679320	2681060	There are no platinum trophies on Xbox.
2681060	2683600	You just have the thousand out of a thousand.
2683600	2686060	So yeah, I feel good.
2686060	2687400	All right.
2687400	2688440	That's it for my gaming week.
2688440	2691620	I think we can get into some more news.
2691620	2698480	I will just mention we will not be here February 20th for reasons I already mentioned.
2698480	2700980	But we will still be here over the next few weeks.
2700980	2703540	So let's try to get into some more gaming news tonight.
2703540	2706060	Loki, why don't you start us off?
2706060	2711760	Yeah, so probably one of the first things that everyone was wondering once Microsoft
2711760	2716140	talked about purchasing Activision Blizzard is, hey, are we going to see some of these
2716140	2718560	older franchises come back?
2718560	2722240	You know, we're going to take some of these studios off of making Call of Duty games every
2722240	2723960	year.
2723960	2726440	And I think it's still a bit early for all that.
2726440	2730700	But Phil Spencer was saying that we're hoping to be able to work with them when the deal
2730700	2734860	closes to make sure we have some resources to work on franchises that I love from my
2734860	2738120	childhood and the teams really want to get.
2738120	2742360	I'm looking forward to these conversations to really think about adding resources, increasing
2742360	2743360	capabilities.
2743360	2748680	So it's not off the table, but nothing definitive yet because they haven't purchased the company
2748680	2749680	yet.
2749680	2750680	So let that happen first.
2750680	2758360	And we'll talk about bringing back Guitar Hero or whatnot, but might be cool.
2758360	2763280	Some of the franchises he had talked about, apparently, from this Washington Post article
2763280	2768220	was King's Quest, Guitar Hero and Hexen.
2768220	2770300	Those are and that's that's a dream list.
2770300	2771300	Yeah, fuck yeah, Hexen.
2771300	2778020	I think that's like at the top of my list of what I want to see come back for sure.
2778020	2782420	What's interesting, you know, and Bobby, you know, because we tape live here at VOG Network,
2782420	2785980	and so I'm usually sitting here as I think a lot of us are listening to Bobby and watching
2785980	2787740	the chat engage with his show.
2787740	2791260	And obviously, this is the big headline on his show tonight, too.
2791260	2792260	And it was interesting.
2792260	2795400	People in chat were piping up talking about what about a new river raid?
2795400	2796720	What about a new pitfall?
2796720	2803320	I have to be honest and respectfully, folks, I I do don't want that, like a new pitfall.
2803320	2809080	Like how would a new pitfall not just be Uncharted or Tomb Raider?
2809080	2814640	Like in my mind, a modern pitfall are those types of games that sure slap pitfall Harry
2814640	2819960	on it and call it pitfall, but it's just going to then it's going to feel reductive to that.
2819960	2821720	And what is there now?
2821720	2823660	Where I would be cool with it.
2823660	2827860	And I would love to see this get explored.
2827860	2832940	I just worry about Microsoft's commitment to retro after Game Room.
2832940	2838020	However, I do remember when the Xbox 360 arcade first came out.
2838020	2845380	We got a lot of pretty cool redos and reskins of older games, but like with Xbox Live features
2845380	2847580	like multiplayer and things like that.
2847580	2853640	I would love a pitfall that still keeps its retro roots in mind.
2853640	2857200	Maybe something that's like a pitfall, pitfall three.
2857200	2861840	I would, I would be all about a pitfall three that is still like a side scrolling adventure,
2861840	2863280	like a little game.
2863280	2869200	Why not let something like pitfall go to a small team of like three or four people and
2869200	2874720	see what they come up with as like a small little, you know, cute little project that
2874720	2875720	I would support.
2875720	2876720	And same thing with like river raid.
2876920	2880220	Like if a river raid game were to come out, it wouldn't even fucking look like the game
2880220	2886180	you remember unless maybe it was something that was geared towards a small or an indie
2886180	2887180	type of thing.
2887180	2890740	And if that's the direction Microsoft goes, then I feel much differently.
2890740	2896280	And I think that can actually be really awesome to see like a pitfall that keeps retro stuff
2896280	2899540	in mind and is kind of uniquely pitfall in that regards.
2899540	2900540	Yeah.
2900540	2901540	Now you're talking chat.
2901540	2902540	Change, right?
2902540	2905600	Says pitfall championship edition, like Pac-Man.
2905600	2909120	Maybe not literally, but you're on the right track.
2909120	2911720	That was a great evolution of Pac-Man.
2911720	2915960	Championship edition is a fantastic evolution of a retro concept.
2915960	2919440	And so you're, yeah, you're, you're going down the right trail there for sure.
2919440	2922360	Pitfall 99.
2922360	2923980	I don't hate it.
2923980	2927340	I don't hate it.
2927340	2929900	Tiger claw says, how about mega mania?
2929900	2936000	You know, I read that at first as a mega man universe for some reason and what that game
2936000	2937000	could have been.
2937000	2939780	And I think that's a game a lot of us are sad never ended up happening.
2939780	2940780	That's for sure.
2940780	2946760	Um, so yeah, dark Tetsuya says, I wouldn't mind a modern rerelease of the 2,600 stuff.
2946760	2947760	Me neither.
2947760	2951440	And I think as long as they can still be a little bit cheeky about the fact that, you
2951440	2957000	know, this, these are Atari 2,600 games and kind of like Loki brought up with his, uh,
2957000	2963080	YouTube criticism of his game that didn't understand that it's a retro inspired game.
2963080	2964080	Yes.
2964080	2966920	It is kind of the same game loop over and over type of thing.
2966920	2970760	As long as it doesn't like try to break some of those things that made those old games
2970760	2971760	work.
2971760	2972760	I think it could be fine.
2972760	2975240	And by the way, how has nobody mentioned Keystone capers yet?
2975240	2976280	Thank you very much.
2976280	2983560	So that's the Activision franchise I'd like to see, but yes, hexen, um, and guitar hero.
2983560	2984560	I think it would be great.
2984560	2988000	Like hexen done, like the new doom games that'd be amazing.
2988000	2989240	Oh my God.
2989240	2990240	Yes.
2990240	2991840	I think, I think really that's at the top.
2991840	2997080	I mean, you know, I love me some retro, but I think a new hexen in the style of new doom
2997080	2998320	is like at the top of my list.
2998320	2999520	I would love to see that.
2999520	3000520	I really would.
3000520	3005200	Um, and as a music game lover, of course, I'd love to see guitar hero come back.
3005200	3010720	And I think it's, we've, we've reached this really interesting place where now that everybody's
3010720	3015320	gotten, not everybody, but a lot of people have gotten rid of their plastic guitars and
3015320	3018400	plastic instruments and that whole thing, and they've unloaded regards.
3018400	3021840	Now people want them again and nobody makes them.
3021840	3026800	Um, and they're harder to get and maybe that's, and I think it was even kind of cited that
3026800	3031920	Activision was hoping maybe Microsoft would have the means to bring the peripherals for
3031920	3037320	those types of games back and maybe make a modern type of guitar hero, which obviously
3037320	3038320	I'm all about that.
3038320	3043520	I would, um, I would really love that Microsoft doesn't shy away from very large controllers.
3043520	3044520	So why not?
3044520	3050200	Um, SSG100 Matt says, I mean that tiny Tina's wonderlands game is going to scratch that
3050200	3051200	hex and itch.
3051200	3052200	Yeah.
3052200	3053960	It's part of why that game looks appealing, honestly.
3053960	3054960	So, um, yeah.
3054960	3061000	So yeah, I, I, I, I'm all about old franchises coming back, but I think we also need to be
3061000	3063540	a little bit measured about it.
3063540	3065560	They're not going to come back for some time.
3066120	3068380	Uh, this deal hasn't even closed yet.
3068380	3074760	It's going to be a while, a while, uh, and maybe, uh, in fact, we might even be talking
3074760	3081400	about Xbox series Y or Z or whatever the hell they come up with next that these sorts of
3081400	3083140	things start happening for.
3083140	3089120	So just, uh, it's going to be a little while, but me, I don't know at the same time, Blizzard
3089120	3095960	making a King's quest game, I I'm kind of into it.
3095960	3096960	Let's see.
3096960	3097960	Let's see.
3097960	3098960	Let's see what they got.
3098960	3102200	You know, somebody might have to research this for me.
3102200	3104080	I'm sorry.
3104080	3111940	Doesn't didn't Sierra come back as an indie brand for Activision because there was a geometry
3111940	3113400	Wars three.
3113400	3114560	Remember?
3114560	3120400	It was a few years ago and it was Sierra online that put it out, but it was like a rebranded
3120400	3124060	Sierra because obviously they did not do the King's quest.
3124060	3127520	Somebody else kind of got the rights to make that game.
3127520	3128520	Okay.
3128520	3129520	Okay.
3129520	3130520	So that is right.
3130520	3131520	Sierra entertainment is an indie brand for active.
3131520	3133040	Oh, they did make the new King's quest.
3133040	3134580	No, I thought that was another studio.
3134580	3135580	Maybe they published it.
3135580	3139880	Probably another studio made it and they published it, but yeah, they did the cause I know geometry
3139880	3142180	Wars three was like one of their first games.
3142180	3144420	Now that is like the label.
3144420	3149780	I would like, I would like to see a pitfall or a Keystone capers and all that shit we
3149780	3154340	were talking about earlier with that type of approach in mind, like they did geometry
3154340	3155340	Wars three.
3155340	3159420	I just don't know how well geometry Wars three sold if there's that incentive to do it, but
3159420	3164300	I'm hoping Phil Spencer, uh, will, will have a different approach to it.
3164300	3165300	I really do.
3165300	3167300	So, all right.
3167300	3169420	Meanwhile, let's talk about Sony.
3169420	3172760	We've been very quiet on the Sony front, but we should talk about what's going on at the
3172760	3173760	house of Sony.
3173760	3177980	And, um, you know, we haven't talked a lot about what this whole Microsoft maneuver might
3177980	3179500	mean for them.
3179500	3184340	And I think in a big way, it really lights a fire under their ass to compete with game
3184340	3188800	pass because I think Phil Spencer is absolutely playing the long game.
3188800	3190740	And I think it's a game about game pass.
3190740	3194420	Um, and PlayStation so far doesn't really have a response to that.
3194420	3197060	Although definitely it seems like the clouds have been brewing, right?
3197060	3201500	We talked about the PlayStation now cards and some of that, that all changed.
3201500	3207900	Well, guess what else happened this last week, a small selection of PlayStation three games
3207900	3214740	priced even showed up on the PlayStation five store, uh, titles in the dead or alive and
3214740	3219440	Prince of Persia, Persia franchises, uh, were showing up.
3219440	3224100	Those games are on PlayStation now, but they shouldn't have been separate titles available
3224100	3234280	on PlayStation five, unless maybe, I mean, we have cloud games on switch, maybe Sony's
3234280	3239080	either plotting cloud games or they have found a way to do backwards compatibility.
3239080	3242360	There was a, there was rumblings of a new Mark Cerny patent.
3242360	3246540	I think, uh, last week or the week before that may have cracked the code when it comes
3246540	3252440	to backwards compatibility, that cracking of code requires me to purchase the game again.
3252440	3256860	That doesn't sound like something I'm interested in and hopefully, cause I remember they did
3256860	3263340	that like PlayStation three, I guess some of that it's in the realm of possibility where
3263340	3265660	they could just say, Oh, you purchased it before.
3265660	3274020	Now you get access to it, but this is Sony and they would be like, well, but we, we upscaled
3274020	3275020	it.
3275020	3276020	So now it's a new game.
3276020	3277020	You have to re-buy it.
3277020	3279180	Like Sony's going to give Microsoft a free weapon.
3279180	3283520	If they do that, if they don't allow the disc based stuff to, at least the digital
3283520	3286680	catalog has to roll over.
3286680	3287680	Like the disc stuff.
3287680	3288680	I get it.
3288680	3289680	That might be a limitation.
3289680	3290680	They just can't do it.
3290680	3295160	But I mean, if one company can do it, I think they should be able to do it, but let's just
3295160	3296760	say, okay, they can't do it.
3296760	3300600	But if I purchase that on the PlayStation three store and I have it in my catalog, which
3300600	3305680	all that's still in my PlayStation network account, then in theory, that should be just
3305680	3309020	unlocked for me when it's available.
3309020	3312040	But I, I'm not holding my breath for that.
3312040	3313040	Yeah.
3313040	3316840	I still, you know, obviously I want to see backwards compatibility as well, but we don't
3316840	3317840	know anything official.
3317840	3322300	There was some weird like commercial thing that had today's date with the retro and people
3322300	3327060	thought that it looked like it really just was a new commercial and nothing about backwards
3327060	3328060	compatibility.
3328060	3333740	Um, so, or maybe Sony was going to say something, but they got the rug pulled under him with
3333740	3334980	this announcement this week.
3334980	3335980	I don't know.
3335980	3339700	Um, so, you know, more, more to develop perhaps on this.
3339700	3346660	Uh, but I, I think GDC, although we don't usually have these huge types of announcements
3346660	3349540	at GDC, it's not for that.
3349540	3354740	I could see them kind of dropping that hint there, but I don't know, maybe something soon.
3354740	3358140	I mean, Sony is perfectly capable of just pushing out a state of play whenever they
3358140	3360180	want, uh, to talk about this.
3360180	3364140	So we'll see who knows, um, before we get to our next story.
3364140	3366740	I want to go back cause chat is talking about this.
3366740	3370820	They're still stuck on the Activision, uh, retro properties.
3370820	3378020	Mike Deft in chat says, get playground studios who does Forza to make a new blur.
3378020	3380740	Oh, that'd be amazing.
3380740	3381740	Hmm.
3381740	3388780	Look y'all, I don't want to be weird, but like, I'm a little horny thinking about that.
3388780	3392220	That is actually a little weird, Rob.
3392220	3393220	I'm sorry.
3393220	3399260	The makers of Forza are doing a new blur, a little bit H word, a little bit H word.
3399260	3401260	All right.
3401260	3402260	Moving on.
3402260	3405260	Darcy, what do you have for us?
3405260	3414260	Um, well, uh, Moki hinted to this earlier, but, um, going back to the Activision Blizzard
3414260	3417820	side of things, they have formed their first union.
3417820	3420580	Well, the company didn't, but employees did.
3420580	3426100	Um, actually technically employees at Raven software, which is owned by Activision Blizzard.
3426100	3428660	Um, they formed a union.
3428660	3433620	Um, it is, uh, made up of about 60 employees.
3433620	3439340	Um, and it, of course they made their announcement just after, uh, Microsoft announcing that
3439340	3441500	they were going to acquire Activision Blizzard.
3441500	3444500	Um, actually I take that back.
3444500	3450380	It's uh, the union is, uh, I mean, the union, yeah, it's a very small one, but it's
3450380	3459420	very significant in the fact that this is one of the first unions at a major developer
3459420	3460820	relatively.
3460820	3469700	Um, this actually came to, uh, to fruition after, um, they had their walkout to protest,
3469700	3473220	uh, the layoffs of contract workers that they said were unfair.
3473220	3480420	Um, so they are wanting to have the changes in the company reflect the wants and needs
3480420	3485220	of the gaming community and the workers that create the product that's, uh, stated by a
3485220	3488260	quality assurance employee named Brent Real.
3488260	3494540	Um, so the union is called the Game Workers Alliance union, um, again, the first at a
3494540	3500540	publicly traded video game publisher and the second video game union in the US.
3500540	3505020	It's going to be part of the Communications Workers of America, which is the largest union
3505020	3507500	in the media industry.
3507500	3516940	Um, so, uh, there are, it's going to be, it's a pretty big deal and hopefully it's going
3516940	3522140	to, to spread, you know, start, start a bigger trend.
3522140	3528340	Um, and on top of that, they're wanting to make sure that overall that they're really
3528340	3530380	just improving the conditions.
3530380	3535140	Um, they, um, they're waiting for the company to recognize them.
3535140	3536820	They have until the 25th.
3536820	3544220	So for us, that's two days from now to, uh, to, uh, recognize them or else there's probably
3544220	3547140	going to be something big coming up.
3547140	3553980	Um, and the only thing that Activation Blizzard ever did after that issue happened is that
3553980	3559820	they raised their minimum compensation for Raven, um, for their QA employees and a few
3559820	3565860	other benefits, but they really didn't do too terribly much, so that's it.
3565860	3570300	It is kind of interesting, you know, because, uh, obviously my head kind of went to, oh,
3570300	3574820	I wonder what the, you know, a better ABK folks think about, you know, everything that's
3574820	3578880	happened with the Microsoft purchase and certainly I wasn't going to expect that like, oh, well,
3578880	3581580	they've just magically dropped all their grievances.
3581580	3585300	It is nice to see that the fight kind of continues in that regard.
3585300	3588900	I think it will be very interesting to see what Microsoft sort of response is to this.
3588900	3594900	And it seems so far their response is just radio silence, which honestly is the smart
3594900	3595900	thing to do.
3595900	3601180	Um, and in regards to that with the whole, you know, looming, uh, going under the microscope
3601180	3605560	with the antitrust and everything like that, um, it's going to be very interesting if Bobby
3605560	3610260	Kotick's legacy is, you know, all my workers unionized once I sold this company type of
3610260	3615580	thing, uh, is going to be interesting, but obviously I, I still fully support these folks
3615580	3616580	and wanting to unionize.
3616580	3617860	It makes sense.
3617860	3623340	You know, they, they've seen how bad it can get, uh, they've hit the bottom and they don't
3623340	3626220	want to ever go back there and they want to unionize to make sure a company can't take
3626220	3627220	them there.
3627220	3628220	So who can blame them?
3628220	3632780	Whether it's Microsoft or even, you know, what's, what's like the most loved gaming
3632780	3636300	company in the world, probably Nintendo, maybe, I don't know, even if Nintendo bought them,
3636300	3638940	I wouldn't expect that this fight would stop.
3638980	3643340	So, um, I think, I think that's, that's, that's pretty neat.
3643340	3645340	So, um, we'll see what happens.
3645340	3649780	One thing that happens with any sort of acquisition is that you can't just go in and make a huge
3649780	3654140	overhaul and expect success out of the business.
3654140	3657900	I mean, I think that that's what a lot of companies make the mistake of doing.
3657900	3665460	It's going, an overhaul is needed, but I think it's going to have to come a bit more fluidly,
3665460	3666460	if that makes sense.
3666460	3667460	Yeah.
3667460	3668460	Yeah.
3668980	3672060	The reality is this deal still won't be finalized for what a year and a half.
3672060	3673420	And that's a long time.
3673420	3677780	And so, you know what, these unions could be up running and in place throughout Activision
3677780	3679380	Blizzard in that time.
3679380	3682180	So we'll see.
3682180	3685620	But I feel Spencer doesn't strike me as the type that's like, I'm going to shut it down
3685620	3686620	or whatever.
3686620	3691780	And, uh, you know, Microsoft does not seem to have the same, um, union busting within
3691780	3693440	its ranks.
3693440	3696580	I thought it was very interesting, by the way, we didn't talk about this earlier, but
3696580	3700500	when Microsoft made that announcement, they posted a picture of their leadership.
3700500	3701500	Interesting.
3701500	3705220	It wasn't Activision Blizzard or any of them, but Microsoft's leadership.
3705220	3710060	And it was very much to show, look how many women are in the structure.
3710060	3714260	And it was definitely flexing that, which is a good thing, but it's, I think in a way
3714260	3715780	it's also flexing.
3715780	3720620	Look who's not here is Frances Townsend or whatever her name is, the union busting one.
3720620	3724540	And I really think that was the kind of flex that like, this is the team that's going to
3724540	3725540	run this.
3725540	3729580	Um, and we don't have the same attitudes, so be interesting.
3729580	3730580	Interesting.
3730580	3731580	All right.
3731580	3734380	Moving on in the mobile world, Loki.
3734380	3735380	Yes.
3735380	3743100	Uh, so Pokemon Go has halted trading because apparently there was a bug in Pokemon Go that
3743100	3747580	was allowing the lucky Pokemon, which I think is like, was it like 50 50?
3747580	3752380	Um, I don't remember what the percentage is that you get a lucky Pokemon on trade, but
3752380	3755700	apparently it was unusually high.
3755700	3760420	And so there was, um, a Reddit post where someone was able to get a hundred lucky Pokemon
3760420	3765140	in a very short span of time, that's supposed to be statistically impossible.
3765140	3771980	Um, and so now they're Niantic is investigating the issue because you can't have your lucky
3771980	3772980	Pokemon.
3772980	3774660	Well, there's a follow up to what you're reading.
3774660	3776220	It's it's back on again.
3776220	3778300	They've resolved whatever it was.
3778300	3779300	Yeah.
3779660	3783500	Just I think just in time for the community day, I did mention it during my gaming week.
3783500	3785180	I tried to do community day.
3785180	3786340	Um, I did the Pikmin one.
3786340	3790120	I walked to my 10,000 steps and we were doing an Ingers thing, a little minor thing for
3790120	3791120	that.
3791120	3794320	Um, but, uh, I was doing a Pokemon later in the day.
3794320	3795560	I only caught one shot.
3795560	3796980	I just don't have luck with Bulbasaur.
3796980	3798820	I caught one shiny Bulbasaur.
3798820	3799820	That's it.
3799820	3804340	And I had like two, uh, so at least I have three now, but, uh, it wasn't a very good
3804340	3805460	IV one.
3805460	3809620	But the problem was I couldn't go pedal to the hours were bad.
3809620	3811480	It was only two to five.
3811480	3816020	They didn't run at the six hour window and I was hosting an event that started at five.
3816020	3820260	So like I had to be done by like three 30 so I could get ready for the event I was hosting
3820260	3821260	last night.
3821260	3824220	So I'm just kind of a bummer on the timing again.
3824220	3829460	So whatever, but at least I can do lucky trades.
3829460	3831900	All right, moving on.
3831900	3835440	Let's talk about, I had brought up cloud gaming earlier in the show.
3835440	3837840	Let's talk about Sora gaming.
3837840	3842480	Uh, let's talk about Kingdom Hearts.
3842480	3847640	Kingdom Hearts is coming out for the switch and there was a trailer that was unveiled
3847640	3850600	that shows it will be out on February 10th.
3850600	3855340	It is important to note these Kingdom Hearts games are cloud versions.
3855340	3859420	So you're going to be playing them on the cloud, which is not new for the switch.
3859420	3861520	There have been other game releases for that.
3861520	3863740	So you do need a consistent internet to play.
3863740	3868420	So my internet after 7.15, which by the way is in a minute, so cross your fingers and
3868420	3873120	toes and hold your breath, is probably not as reliable for that.
3873120	3879980	But for most people that have decent internet connections in the city and what have you,
3879980	3882100	it might be a way to play these games.
3882100	3890300	I kind of think this is a little late and it makes more sense in Japan perhaps.
3890300	3894420	But I guess there might be some people here that want to get into it, especially, I don't
3894420	3897900	know, maybe if the switch is the only one in your house because you have younger folks
3897900	3898900	and what have you.
3898900	3903020	I mean, I do get the logic behind it, but I just, I don't see this exactly being the
3903020	3908500	hot cake seller that I think it would have been some time ago.
3908500	3910660	Now, there will be a demo.
3910660	3914280	In fact, it's actually out now if you want to try that on the eShop.
3914280	3916400	They are also cloud versions.
3916400	3918180	So I will give it that.
3918180	3923060	You have free reign to test this and see what you think about the cloud gaming on the switch.
3923060	3926780	So you can make your own judgment on how your internet behaves and if it's the way you want
3926780	3927980	to play or not.
3927980	3930700	I think Control was one of the other games that did this.
3930700	3935740	It had a demo on the shop and was a cloud game ultimately at the end of the day.
3935740	3940500	There's also going to be a Kingdom Hearts 20th anniversary celebration stream that will
3940500	3942420	happen on April 10th.
3942420	3945300	Who knows if they'll announce anything special with that.
3945300	3948300	I don't know if you want to get your hopes up too much with that.
3948300	3951940	I don't think we're, well, I don't know.
3951940	3955740	Over under on a Kingdom Hearts 4, folks?
3955740	3956900	It won't be 4.
3956900	3957900	That's too normal.
3957900	3959460	Oh yeah, you're right.
3959460	3972140	We need Kingdom Hearts 3, Remind, Remaster, Redone, Under, 2-4 for Destiny's Kiss edition.
3972140	3976460	They'll have like some big like long calculus equation as part of the title.
3976460	3980580	Yeah, for Dancing Stage.
3980580	3981580	True Kiss Destination.
3981580	3982580	All right.
3982580	3983580	Anyway, we'll see.
3983580	3985260	We'll see what happens with that.
3985260	3990180	But I would say they're not, they're not going to do a stream on April 10th and not announce
3990180	3992180	anything.
3992180	3997820	It could be as simple as that horrible theater them successor that they did.
3997820	3998820	I'm sorry.
3998820	3999820	I did not like that game.
3999820	4002940	I think they're going to do a new one of those that I'm supposed to get excited about.
4002940	4005460	But we'll see.
4005460	4009660	What do y'all in chat think over twitch.tv slash vog network?
4009660	4017300	E3VL points out Kingdom Hearts all in one for PS4 usually goes for $30 versus the amount
4017300	4019060	that this is going to cost on the Switch.
4019060	4020580	That's a very good point as well.
4020580	4021580	That's sure.
4021580	4026620	So if people don't have the other consoles, they'll pay what they want.
4027420	4032700	Especially if it's something like get their kids on the game or something, you know.
4032700	4033700	All right.
4033700	4034700	Moving on.
4034700	4037820	Dark Soccer, you have a good industry story, right?
4037820	4038820	I do.
4038820	4046780	So there was a survey that came out of the game developers conference where they did
4046780	4050180	their 10th edition state of the game industry.
4050180	4053220	That was, I believe, last Thursday.
4053220	4059100	But they pulled more than 2700 developers across a series of topics.
4059100	4065580	And so 62 percent of the responders said their companies did nothing to engage with conversations
4065580	4070080	around misconduct and toxicity.
4070080	4074540	They said also some respondents said that their companies don't have these problems,
4074540	4078700	but mostly because they were too small or they weren't based in the U.S. or their companies
4078700	4083420	had a zero tolerance policy or it wasn't something that they witnessed.
4083420	4084420	There was a yes.
4084420	4089820	But they said that in that survey, 38 percent of respondents said that their employees did
4089820	4091900	take action.
4091900	4098020	And it is a growing trend in workplaces in the industry to have some initiative to root
4098020	4100140	out toxicity.
4100140	4109020	So what they're basically saying is, I mean, some of them are saying that it's a very North
4109020	4119220	American focus, but a lot of people are really just unhappy with how their leadership responds.
4119220	4123780	Some of the comments say they bury it, pretend it isn't a problem, they act like it's different.
4123780	4127300	There continue to be people harassed and silenced.
4127300	4129540	I've had to force them to make internal statements.
4129540	4133540	We were affected by the Blizzard misconduct and we opted to say nothing.
4133540	4137500	My faith in big companies to do the right thing is non-existent.
4137500	4140620	Another quote, no one is surprised by misconduct.
4140620	4144500	We've seen it or experienced it in some form or another in our career.
4144500	4146180	Our companies spoke to trying to do better.
4146180	4152660	They started creating classes and inviting speakers to inform and educate people.
4152660	4157460	They have another survey, according to the survey, actually, this is 23 percent of developers
4157460	4162500	polled said unions, talks have taken place at their studio and a lot of people say that
4162500	4163500	it's needed.
4163500	4169100	Fifty-five percent of respondents say that they should unionize, but there are some that
4169100	4174580	are still, you know, resisting it, but that's the general consensus is that there needs
4174580	4177540	to be more done to combat toxicity.
4177540	4184780	It's not happening, but it's starting to happen more, but it's not enough and that more people
4184780	4186900	are interested in unionizing.
4186900	4193540	Yeah, and, you know, it's it just goes to kind of underline and score when these Blizzard
4193540	4199020	Activision issues first came up that, you know, this was this is not a problem unique
4199020	4200020	to them.
4200020	4205580	It was definitely exacerbated by them and, you know, enabled by Bobby Kotick, et cetera.
4205580	4208300	But you know, we've known that this is an issue throughout the industry.
4208300	4212220	You know, obviously, you've heard everything about Ubisoft and plenty, plenty, plenty of
4212220	4213220	other places.
4213220	4215260	What happened to Riot Games previously, et cetera, et cetera.
4215260	4216660	List goes on and on and on.
4216660	4221860	So I think this, you know, survey sort of just underscores the fact that a lot of these
4221860	4225180	problems are an industry problem.
4225180	4231120	And any leader of any game company, big, small, medium sized, should really be evaluating
4231120	4237540	some of the policies when it comes to investigating these sorts of issues and maybe passively
4237540	4244180	enabling some of these issues, which I think is happening way too far off than is the case.
4244180	4256460	Well, silence and refusal to do anything is almost like a nonverbal endorsement.
4256460	4257460	Yeah.
4257460	4264500	That for the people who don't say anything and don't do anything, you are by your inaction
4264500	4268620	endorsing this behavior because it's not, in your mind, bad enough to say something
4268620	4269960	about it.
4269960	4272580	And I think that's, you're complicit.
4272580	4276220	I think that's a real element of what's been happening in so many of these game companies
4276220	4281180	for far too long is it's just like, oh, those are personal issues we don't want to get into
4281180	4287300	or deal with or it's, you know, but it's, you know, there's definitely been a gross
4287300	4293120	culture in the industry for a long, long time underscored by what E3 used to look like when
4293120	4294800	we first started going.
4294800	4296320	I have an analogy, actually.
4296320	4297320	Sure.
4297320	4305120	So if you imagine somebody who, say, has an illness or has like, OK, we're going to say
4305120	4310400	someone has a drinking problem, we're just going to start that.
4310400	4315160	And maybe at first things seem kind of fun, you know, kind of, oh, we're loose, everything
4315160	4316720	is great here.
4316720	4322280	And then they start having like a little bit of a liver problem or their skin gets bad.
4322280	4328160	But they're not willing to do what it takes to fix those issues by taking care of the
4328160	4332200	core issue, which is the drinking, you know.
4332200	4336180	And so after a while, they start going into liver failure.
4336180	4339480	They start having all these other issues happen.
4339480	4343480	Things around them start going to shit.
4343480	4345080	And we're seeing that in companies.
4345080	4350380	It's kind of the same thing where, just use the biggest elephant.
4350860	4357820	We have Activision Blizzard who things internally have gone so much to shit that they're being
4357820	4365500	acquired and companies around them are now affected by this, having to take a deep, hard
4365500	4366500	look.
4366500	4371340	They're being scrutinized because of the type of behavior that they're endorsing.
4371340	4373500	It's all just that cycle.
4373500	4377300	Yeah, good analogy.
4377300	4379660	I can think of more, but we'll just get to our next.
4379660	4380660	I think that was a good analogy.
4380660	4381660	We'll leave it at that.
4381660	4385020	So let's get to our next story.
4385020	4388980	Speaking of things that are ugly and dark-sided, Loki.
4388980	4390200	Yeah.
4390200	4391780	So we talked about this.
4391780	4398660	Not you, but what you're going to talk about, just to be clear, I meet that description.
4398660	4404880	But we were talking about another dark-sided evil person by the name of Ruben Sim, who
4404880	4412400	was banned from Roblox for apparently leading cyber mobs to harass the player base.
4412400	4413400	He was also...
4413400	4416760	Can we think about that statement for a minute too?
4416760	4418380	Banned by Roblox?
4418380	4420760	Can we just marinate in that for a minute?
4420760	4421760	Yeah.
4421760	4423360	Well, there's more to it though.
4423360	4426560	Remember, he also called in bomb threats to...
4426560	4431680	Oh, my God, this is the same guy?
4431680	4432680	Yeah.
4433680	4442880	So apparently, according to the Oakland, California export, he had been issued, I guess, apparently
4442880	4447080	he was supposed to be not going back on Roblox.
4447080	4449600	They tried to ban him.
4449600	4454640	He was also charged $160,000 for damages.
4454640	4462160	Well, apparently, because it's a free-to-play game, he is circumventing their IP bans by
4462160	4470200	getting other people to create accounts for him, or I'm assuming the VPNs, perhaps.
4470200	4476760	So he has been continually logging into Roblox and continuing his false threats of terrorism
4476760	4480160	activity relating to Roblox.
4480160	4489000	And also, apparently, he is supposed to be not able to gain access to the platform, not
4489000	4494160	make false statements about the game and its employees or go near its offices, post
4494160	4498160	or republish those threats as well.
4498160	4506480	And apparently, he is now forced into a temporary lockdown while local police and private security
4506480	4509880	conducted a search of a secure facility.
4509880	4513400	I guess he had made some more threats regarding the developers conference.
4513400	4519080	I don't know if there's anything more they could really do to keep him off the platform
4519080	4521240	if it's so easy for him to get back on there.
4521240	4524280	Why isn't he in jail is what I want to know.
4524280	4530040	I'm reminded of this meme I've seen on the internet of, I'm trying to get it to come
4530040	4534560	up here, I'm reminded of this meme I've seen online on the internet of Baby Bop holding
4534560	4539440	a stop sign saying, basically saying, you need to stop.
4539440	4544200	And that is what I think somebody needs to send this person in the mail or some other
4544200	4547920	way to tell this person that they really need to stop.
4547920	4550920	This is beyond the point of ridiculousness.
4550920	4557080	So apparently, he has a huge following on YouTube and he's still posting videos on this
4557080	4558080	thing as well.
4558080	4559480	And YouTube needs to start taking his channel down.
4559480	4561600	I agree with that too, for sure.
4561600	4569120	Well, Roblox is suing him for $1.6 million, so this should hopefully get him the stop.
4569360	4571200	I think that there's something wrong with this guy.
4572200	4572800	Do you think?
4575120	4578520	Well, if nothing else, maybe a lawsuit will finally shut him up.
4579280	4580080	I doubt it.
4580520	4581440	Well, yeah, it's true.
4581440	4586960	Now, it'll just be YouTube's about the lawsuit, but I do agree YouTube should probably
4586960	4590000	deplatform him so he can yell and scream into the void.
4590800	4591320	All right.
4591520	4595400	Well, lots of people have been yelling and screaming in the YouTube void about the
4595400	4601440	Nintendo Switch Online emulator and how it wasn't very good for certain Nintendo 64
4601440	4605320	games, which kind of sucks when Nintendo's charging a premium.
4605560	4610160	And people honestly thought that, well, we'll probably just have to deal with this
4610160	4613600	forever because when's Nintendo going to bother to patch these emulators?
4613960	4615400	Well, plot twist.
4615680	4618960	It turns out Nintendo patched the emulator.
4619680	4625120	So Nintendo, I think they just put out this week was Banjo-Kazooie this week.
4625160	4630800	Yeah, so Banjo-Kazooie just came out as part of the N64 library on January 20th.
4631000	4633120	So that added to the library.
4633120	4637080	And by the way, Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask is coming in February.
4637080	4640200	So, you know, adding new games is not unheard of.
4640200	4642120	And we knew some of those were coming.
4642720	4646720	But what's interesting is that when they and I think they've done this too, is that, you
4646720	4652320	know, that Nintendo Online application is basically an all in one app that they just
4652320	4654040	add the new games into it.
4654720	4657000	I don't think it's like talking to a server or anything like that.
4657000	4658920	I think they're just patching that game over and over.
4659200	4663440	So or patching that executable or whatever you want to call it over and over with the
4663440	4667800	new games. Well, it turns out they actually patched the emulator as a part of this too.
4668400	4673320	It was spotted on Twitter that the Nintendo 64 emulator does a better job at displaying
4673320	4676200	water in the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
4676720	4682760	The fog is still missing, but it sounds like the water temple is like actually playable
4682760	4686880	now at this point, whereas in the emulator as it stood before, it was virtually
4686880	4693720	unplayable. So I think it's worth noting Nintendo is updating the emulator, not just
4693720	4698840	with new games, but fixing and addressing some of these issues, even if it's not perfect
4699320	4705640	yet. E3VL in chat asks, they have a roadmap now just for the next month or two.
4705640	4708760	Just we know that Majora's Mask is coming, but we don't really know beyond that.
4708800	4713000	We've had a bunch of shit teased in the trailer, but we don't know exactly when those
4713000	4717120	games are coming out. But it is nice to see someone fix that.
4717400	4722280	So someone is assigned to making the emulator better or trying to work on some of these
4722280	4727040	issues. So that is refreshing to see, because I think many of us were kind of resigned to
4727040	4732040	the fact that Nintendo was not going to do shit about shit with it, with the emulator
4732040	4734240	and just take your money and laugh with it all the way to the bank.
4734440	4739800	So it is nice to see Nintendo should be applauded for doing the right thing.
4739800	4741840	So I will give them one clap.
4741920	4744000	Here we go. There you go.
4744000	4746280	One clap for doing the right thing in this circumstance.
4749280	4752240	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh, so you can beat the water temple?
4752760	4755240	I kid, although I didn't do it until a few years ago.
4755240	4757120	Well, it's a little easier now for sure.
4758080	4763520	SG100Matt in chat says, no Super Nintendo or NES Nintendo online updates.
4764080	4765120	What?
4765120	4766520	What a shot.
4766520	4771520	I thought we were paying all of this money and this expansion passes and stuff, and I'm
4771520	4773160	not getting more content.
4773640	4775880	I am so surprised.
4776360	4781880	You mean the base level Nintendo online people are getting jack and shit now?
4782960	4785440	I am so shocked.
4785880	4790960	This is totally new information that was unexpected.
4790960	4793240	Got some vital information.
4794520	4802680	All right, maybe, maybe we need our next segment and a time when things weren't so complicated.
4813440	4818960	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4818960	4820840	out a classic and tell you about it.
4821200	4823960	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4825120	4829960	And Dark Sakura, what did you pick for episode 900's Classic Game of the Week?
4831040	4831760	Pick Dear Esther.
4834520	4841720	Dear Esther is a first person exploration game developed by the Chinese Room.
4841760	4847600	It came out for Windows OS X, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
4847680	4854440	It was released in 2008 as a free to play mod for the Source game engine.
4854760	4860720	And then it was redeveloped entirely for a commercial release in 2012.
4861160	4863160	It is a very minimalistic game.
4863160	4865480	You basically just explore.
4866400	4873760	It's an island in Scotland and you listen to a man who is reading a series of letters to
4873760	4875920	his, excuse me, deceased wife.
4876920	4881800	And then you learn about how she died over the course of the exploration.
4884160	4890120	This is the same company, by the way, that did Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, just so
4890120	4896360	that, you know, in 2017, they did an updated version called Dear Esther Landmark Edition
4896360	4898960	that was released based in Unity.
4899960	4909200	Anyway, like I said, you explore this island, listening to the man reading a series of letter
4909200	4915120	fragments to Esther, his deceased wife, and you reach new locations in the game.
4915160	4918280	And that plays a letter fragment that relates to that area.
4919120	4925880	The different fragments are revealed in each playthrough of the game.
4926760	4929280	So you get a slightly different narrative each time.
4930160	4932880	Several other characters are referred to by the narrator.
4932880	4935440	You have a man named Donnelly who charted the island.
4936440	4941200	Paul, who is the drunk driver that suggested, was involved in Esther's death.
4942360	4946280	A shepherd named Jacobson who lived on the island in the 18th century.
4947560	4951400	And then you find these remains of buildings, a shipwreck, a cave system.
4951400	4953760	The cave system is my favorite part of this game, by the way.
4954160	4958560	And you get you see like different images on the cave walls that have like chemical
4958560	4962360	diagrams, circuit diagrams, neurons, bacteria, different things like that.
4963360	4968200	And you also see a figure walking away in the distance, but they vanish before you can
4968200	4972120	find them. And it does have a little bit of an ambiguous ending to it.
4974440	4976640	It is a very beautiful game.
4976640	4985680	I think that it's really absolutely worth everyone playing through at least once.
4986520	4991840	But to go back into the development history of this game, it was a source engine mod
4991840	4993240	that was developed by the Chinese room.
4993240	4996120	Well, they were part of a research project for the University of Portsmouth.
4997200	5002760	They were funded by a grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and it was
5002760	5007200	led by Dan Pinchbeck, who is a professor at the university.
5008600	5016080	He developed the story and the script and he cited the works of William S. Burroughs
5016080	5023760	in the writing, particularly to the way it would be image heavy and symbolic.
5023760	5026800	So, you know, trying to do a different sort of narrative.
5027400	5039040	So basically, an independent game artist named Robert Briscoe worked on redeveloping
5039040	5042880	Dear Esther in 2009 under Pinchecks support.
5043440	5051160	So he in the Chinese room worked on the remake with redoing some of the level design
5051160	5054640	and using concept art by a man named Ben Andrews.
5055000	5060200	They redesigned the game's landscape, they tried to remove some of the confusion with
5060200	5067080	the original layout and make the environment richer and more compelling instead of just
5067080	5069840	completely barren landscape in the original.
5070840	5078280	But the Chinese room lost their backing and then they ended up finding backing instead
5078760	5083880	by the Indie Fund, who didn't really want to do it at first.
5083920	5085520	After the demo, they're like, oh, this is cool.
5085520	5086600	And they funded it.
5088320	5095560	After so the game went through it, once they were playing it, people were like, oh,
5095560	5096640	heck yeah, this is rad.
5097960	5100560	Other people who were a bit iffy on it.
5100720	5107160	So to let you know, once the game was released on Steam, within the first six
5107160	5112600	hours, they sold 16000 units and it allowed the developers to pay back the Indie Fund
5112600	5121800	investment. Their narrator was Nigel Carrington, who had an extended script for the
5121800	5128520	remake. The music was done by Pinchbeck's wife, Jessica Curry, who's a freelance music
5128520	5130520	composer and the co-director of the Chinese room.
5130920	5136520	And then she completely overhauled and reorchestrated it for the commercial release,
5136760	5141520	basically doubling the length of the original soundtrack, which the original game
5141520	5144320	soundtrack was available on July 8th, 2008.
5144320	5150440	And then there is a remastered soundtrack that was available as of February 14th, 2012
5150440	5152160	on Amazon, iTunes and Bandcamp.
5153560	5160480	The original release of it was selected for the animation exhibition in the 2008
5160480	5166760	Pre-Arts Electronica and made ModDB's top 100 mods of 2008.
5167080	5173160	And in 2009, the game won award for Best World Story at Indie Arcade Independent Games
5173160	5183360	Awards. It got a lot of praise and attached to emotions that not many people would
5183360	5185360	address in the game like unhappiness.
5185960	5195560	And as for the commercial release, it got some pretty great reviews, 75 out of 100 on
5195560	5200720	Metacritic. There are people who are like, oh, is this a game or is this just a story
5200720	5202640	that you participate in?
5205080	5209720	Some people said that the story seemed pretty obscure and a little hard to follow.
5212720	5219520	It got anywhere between really positive reviews and some slightly mediocre reviews,
5219520	5221760	so it really depends on who you ask.
5222760	5230760	The game was considered, though, a graphical masterpiece and that it also won at the
5230760	5232760	Independent Games Festival in 2012.
5233000	5241880	It received the prize for excellent in visual arts, awarded them the prize for best use of
5241880	5243960	narrative in the 2012 awards.
5243960	5252840	TIGA Games Industry Awards of 2012 gave it the Originality Award and Best Action
5252840	5257400	Adventure Game, Best Visual Design, Best Audio Design, Best Debut Game, and it was
5257640	5262000	nominated for five awards at the 9th British Academy Video Games Awards.
5262920	5266880	As of September 2013, it sold over 850,000 copies.
5267760	5268600	And there you go.
5268600	5277680	Dear Esther, I played through this at work, like a few years ago.
5278600	5284560	A lot of people in chat are doing the whole OMG because our criteria for the classic game
5284560	5288320	of the week, if you are not aware, is a game needs to be at least 10 years old, which is
5288320	5292720	funny because now we get a lot of games that are our show is older than them, but they
5292720	5294320	still classify for classic game of the week.
5294720	5299520	And yes, Dear Esther isn't just 10 years old folks, it's 14 years old.
5299920	5302240	14 years old because I'm going by the original release date.
5302680	5311760	However, it will be considered commercially 12 years old next month.
5313040	5318680	And also, when you kind of talk about the whole, it was very critically polarizing.
5318680	5322440	I think it really was the first of those walking simulator games.
5322720	5325360	I think some people try to use that label as a negative.
5325360	5327680	I look at it as a little bit more empowering.
5328440	5330960	And I think those types of games are very divisive.
5331200	5332720	I enjoy Dear Esther.
5332720	5334800	I didn't enjoy it as much.
5334800	5336040	I think it's beautiful.
5336160	5341080	But I agree that the story is a little harder to follow than maybe when the Chinese room
5341080	5341920	did their follow up.
5341920	5348440	Everybody's gone to the rapture, which is probably one of the best video games I've
5348440	5352920	played, which and I think that studio kind of fell apart, didn't they?
5353160	5355760	No, they were purchased by Sumo.
5356360	5357200	Oh, OK.
5357200	5363520	And in 2020, they did a game called Little Orpheus, and it's actually an Apple arcade
5363520	5365400	game, which I'm going to look into it.
5365400	5369640	Honestly, in 2017, they also did a game called So Let Us Melt.
5371200	5373240	But I didn't know about that one.
5373240	5377400	I'm going to have to look that one up and see what kind of game it is.
5377720	5382000	And yeah, the music, the music in this game is gorgeous, as was again, I hate to keep
5382000	5385800	comparing it to everybody's gone to the rapture, but I'm going to because that was, you
5385800	5387160	know, I'd heard of Dear Esther.
5387160	5391000	I wasn't really motivated to look at it until I play.
5391000	5393920	Everybody's gone to the rapture and just thought it was brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.
5394640	5395120	I will.
5395120	5397120	This game is is gorgeous.
5397120	5398200	If nothing else.
5399040	5404760	Yes, go walk in it and just explore the environment, because even for being 2008 now,
5404800	5408000	granted, I don't know if we're watching like a play through of like a remaster because I
5408000	5411480	know they kind of upped it up a little bit when they did like the PS4 release and stuff.
5411800	5419360	But even still, this game is gorgeous today and is worth looking at just for like Dark
5419360	5421160	Soccer was talking about the cave system is really cool.
5421160	5424640	In fact, those watching live on Twitch were seeing a little bit of that right now.
5424640	5429760	But I love the way the clouds look and the sky looks like it's just such a damn good
5429760	5434560	looking game. You just get a little Orpheus actually got really good reviews.
5434920	5437040	For the record, and it is on Apple Arcade.
5437600	5441440	And on top of that, it looks like the developers actually reply to the reviews.
5442240	5443640	Oh, like Loki.
5445360	5446800	Just all right.
5447400	5448840	But all right.
5449440	5454240	There it is, your classic game of the week, a good one, a little unexpected for for
5454240	5455560	around nine hundred.
5455560	5460120	But at the same time, it's it's such a genre starter.
5460480	5463520	You know, it is I mean, a game is a very notable game.
5463520	5469160	I mean, I'm actually tempted to do a new stream of that game.
5469160	5473600	I've been thinking about it either that I was actually, you know, it's me, Holly.
5474800	5475960	Oh, yeah, she's great.
5476560	5481720	Yeah, well, she's doing some other kind of narrative games and I suggest it because
5481720	5482600	she's playing Firewatch.
5483120	5484480	Oh, OK. That's another good one.
5484480	5489040	And I suggested everybody's gone to the rapture and she seemed really interested in
5489120	5492160	because I honestly enough that game is is.
5493480	5495600	Both of these games are masterpieces, in my opinion.
5495600	5500960	Yeah, and again, I know it's been a while since I've advocated for this game on the
5500960	5502400	show, so please let me take a moment.
5502680	5504840	If you've never played, everybody's gone to the rapture.
5505160	5508840	You really need to it is and it is not action packed.
5509280	5511080	It is not shooty shooty bang bang.
5512160	5518200	But it is like just the music, the environments, the story is so good.
5518240	5519720	Like I have a clamp just thinking about it.
5519720	5520680	That game is so good.
5521120	5522880	So it's just I want more more.
5522880	5524080	It's it's art.
5524320	5525320	It's art, mama.
5525320	5526800	It's art. But is it art?
5526800	5528560	It's art. All right.
5528560	5530480	Indeed. All right.
5530960	5535280	Let's move on with some other quick headlines here in the segment we call Rapid Fire News.
5535280	5536880	Loki. Yeah.
5536880	5540760	So there is a program called Playdate Pulp, which is out of beta.
5540760	5547200	It is a game making development tool that you can use for the play date, which is that
5547200	5552600	kind of handheld monochrome console with the crank on the side that I don't know when
5552600	5557000	that's coming out. But if you want to make games for it, you can check it out for free.
5558200	5559360	So that's pretty awesome.
5559720	5560880	It looks neat.
5560880	5565040	I'd be curious to see what I could do with it, but I don't have a play date to play any
5565040	5571240	of this on. So I don't know what I would do with it, but it's kind of all in one.
5571640	5576360	So if you're interested in check it out at play date slash pulp.
5577200	5584680	And then we have news that Dying Light 2 will include a free PlayStation 5 and Xbox
5584680	5593040	Series X update or upgrade since they're going to be shipping, I guess, with I don't know
5593040	5598240	if those are coming out at the same time, but apparently, yeah, if you pick it up, you're
5598240	5601120	going to be able to get those updates.
5601120	5602040	So that's kind of cool.
5602520	5609400	And then they're going to have three different rendering modes, and they've got a quality
5609400	5611360	and resolution mode.
5611360	5616360	So I'm guessing that the quality is going to add ray tracing and then resolution will
5616360	5620600	be at 4K performance is going to be rendering at 60 FPS.
5620600	5630680	So you can pick one, you give it more resolution, ray tracing, FPS, pick one.
5630680	5632320	I think FPS is going to win out, though.
5633600	5637120	I did want to before I get to Dark Soccer's headlines, Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out
5637120	5640360	about the Playdate pulp that there is a Playdate emulator with that.
5640360	5642760	So it's a way for you to play those games if you'd like.
5642960	5643800	So there is that.
5644320	5648520	All right. And dark Tetsuya said, oh, darn, I was going to ask when the Pixel Poops number
5648520	5650280	two port was coming to the Playdate.
5650280	5652040	So I guess I guess another time.
5652760	5653680	All right. Dark Soccer.
5653720	5659720	Yeah. So speaking, though, back to Dying Light, Dying Light 2 and Life is Strange
5659880	5662200	remaster have been delayed for the Switch.
5664160	5670600	They were supposed to be coming out very soon.
5671280	5677240	Instead, they're looking that they're going to be coming out much later than the next
5677240	5683000	month. The other platforms, though, should have Life is Strange remastered on February
5683000	5685240	1st and Dying Light 2 on February 4th.
5685240	5695160	And then in sad news, pinball designer Lyman Sheets died and we're all very sad.
5695360	5703000	He did like the last action hero, Tommy and Guns N' Roses, of which I have owned a last
5703000	5704600	action hero and Guns N' Roses.
5706560	5710000	All right. Can I tell him?
5710600	5714280	Oh, and he also apparently worked on Medieval Madness.
5715720	5720360	Speaking of celebrities who passed away, can I tell you maybe a slightly tasteless joke,
5720360	5721760	but I thought it was really good.
5722400	5723480	It's a tender subject.
5724520	5726080	It's along those same lines.
5726080	5730240	OK, so Meat Loaf passed away this week, obviously, as we know.
5730240	5734280	And, you know, we should take a moment to remember Meat Loaf for who he was.
5734520	5740200	He had incredible contributions to music, incredible contributions to film and things
5740240	5746840	like Rocky Horror. And in his final years and in his final years was a raging lunatic
5747040	5749720	that subscribed to conspiracy theories and said some bad things.
5749720	5751720	But but two out of three ain't bad.
5756640	5758200	That still is a tender subject.
5758240	5759800	All right, moving on.
5759800	5760480	Rob gets it.
5760480	5761760	I saw that in a tweet.
5762120	5765040	I massaged the language a little bit, made it my own.
5765680	5767560	But I'm going to tell that one at the next Rocky Horror.
5767560	5768240	So be ready for it.
5768640	5774360	I still thought that there were people who were having Meat Loaf for dinner that night.
5777200	5782760	Yeah, all right, Tiger Claw points out, we also lost Louie Anderson, who are a lot of
5782760	5785720	people remember that show he had the was it Louie's Kids or something like that?
5785960	5792760	I remember the Family Feud revival he hosted for years and years and years and him doing
5792760	5798200	that. So, yeah, apparently I never really saw a lot of his comic stuff.
5799080	5802080	But my understanding is he was a pretty bang up stand up comic.
5802080	5804760	So, yeah, oh, boy.
5804760	5808240	And then, you know, of course, we lost Betty White right at the end of last year.
5808240	5809440	And I mean, right at the end of last year.
5809440	5811080	Did you see a new video of her came out?
5811080	5811920	Sidney Poitier.
5812440	5817680	Oh, yeah, Sidney Poitier. But but a new Betty White video came out and that's what I was
5817680	5822680	getting to is that something she had filmed, it looked like like an interlude, maybe for
5822680	5826240	her hundredth thing. But it was really it was days before she ended up passing.
5826560	5831320	And it was just it was nice to see her, even if it was, you know, difficult knowing what
5831320	5834000	happened soon after. But, yeah, had me thinking about that.
5835920	5841600	Let's see, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Webber Grill had their Friday recipe email come
5841600	5844040	out that day, which was a meatloaf recipe.
5844240	5845720	They issued an apology.
5845720	5849960	You know what? That's that's the problem with auto scheduling your social media posts.
5850320	5853360	I wouldn't have apologized for that.
5854040	5857000	Like he's the one the food was first.
5857040	5858680	He named himself after the food.
5858680	5860960	His name. His name was Robert Paulson.
5861080	5862120	His name was Robert.
5862120	5863200	Actually, no, it was Marvin today.
5863200	5864240	But still. All right.
5864520	5866640	Let's move on in serious news.
5866760	5871480	Let's get to world release dates and release dates in different countries, starting with
5871480	5872320	the U.S. Loki.
5873040	5877840	Yes. So this week we have the Artful Escape on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation
5877840	5882040	5, Gunvolt Chronicles, Luminous Avenger, I.X.
5882040	5889720	2. That's on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox series.
5890520	5898360	Pokemon Legends, Arxius, better known as Unity 3D presents Pokemon Legends, Arxius.
5899320	5905280	That is on Nintendo Switch and then better that are also known as check Shane's Twitter
5905280	5907640	because he posts about literally nothing else lately.
5908600	5911680	I saw some screenshots from it and yikes.
5911680	5915080	And yeah, I'm intrigued.
5915360	5916440	I'm going to buy it. I'm a play it.
5916440	5921440	I'm intrigued. Uncharted Legacy of Thieves collection on PlayStation five.
5921440	5922600	And that's it.
5923400	5927280	I will say you do know I love me a drag queen tangent.
5927480	5929800	So Dark Soccer, I bet you haven't seen this yet.
5930200	5935120	It is a little spoilery for Arceus if you are trying to keep yourself hidden from new
5935120	5937040	Pokemon and new forms that are in the game.
5937080	5942160	So if you are trying to keep yourself pure from that, don't look this up.
5942400	5944480	But Dark Soccer, I feel like you probably don't give a shit.
5944800	5949080	Look at Aquarius Twitter, the winner of Drag Race Season 10 Aquaria.
5949360	5951960	She did with one day's notice.
5951960	5957280	She did an outfit based on one of the leaks from Pokemon Legends Arceus.
5957280	5959160	It's pretty amazing.
5959160	5961480	So I figured you might appreciate that.
5961880	5964040	So I'm trying to find it.
5964360	5965880	It would have been a few days ago. So sorry.
5966040	5967320	I don't know how. Oh, damn.
5967680	5968840	Yeah. Nice, huh?
5969560	5970520	Yeah. Yeah.
5970520	5973080	I wish I could show you the original picture again.
5973080	5975800	I don't want to I don't want to broadcast it because I know some people are sensitive
5975800	5978800	about spoilers, but I know Arxis Arxis.
5978800	5980480	I don't know how to pronounce it, nor do I care.
5980480	5982800	Arceus Arceus.
5983600	5986400	I thought it was Arceus. That's how I've heard most people saying it.
5986400	5988360	But OK, Arceus.
5990040	5995840	All right, well, let's move on and talk about Japanese release dates on the switch.
5995920	6002400	In Japan this week, on the 27th, we have Kamigami no Asobe Luderi Deorum Unite edition.
6002400	6008600	We also have Gunvolt Chronicles Luminous Avenger 9-2 coming out in a regular and limited edition.

6023040	6028320	And we have Magatsu Barai in a regular and limited edition.
6028920	6030640	They love their limited editions overseas.
6030640	6032400	We also have a few other games coming out.
6032400	6036520	We have a Grand Theft Auto Trilogy Definitive Edition gets a Japanese release this week.
6036520	6038880	Well, that's that's nice. Maybe they finally worked out those bugs.
6039160	6042520	And Star Melody Yumemi Dreamer comes out in Japan this week.
6042720	6050000	And there's one more, Shika Banagurai no Bokenmeshi comes out in Japan.
6050040	6052800	It's a very busy week in Japan on the switch.
6053240	6056960	Quickly looking to see if we have anything on the PlayStation 5 this week.
6057640	6060800	We have some peripheral color things.
6060800	6063640	Oh, the I think those are the official releases.
6063640	6065720	The console covers are out this week in Japan.
6065720	6071520	But otherwise, we have the Uncharted Legacy of Thieves collection gets its PlayStation 5 release
6072000	6075000	and that really pretty purple wireless controller as well.
6075000	6076360	So there is that.
6076920	6078160	How about the UK, Dark Sakura?
6080360	6083760	On the 27th, we have Rugby 22.
6084080	6089600	We also have Pokemon Legends Arceus on the 28th for Switch for PlayStation.
6089600	6096400	Also on the 28th, we have the following four games, Human Fall Flat Anniversary Edition,
6096840	6103880	Wanderer PSVR, Horror Tales and Uncharted Legacy of Thieves collection.
6106160	6106840	All right.
6107400	6111680	By the way, yeah, before I forget, and I should have done this right at the beginning,
6111960	6120120	I want to thank Blaxican for the shout out that he gave us in his channel right before we went live.
6120280	6122200	So, oh, that was very nice of him.
6122200	6122600	Thank you.
6122600	6127880	I was watching him earlier today, but I wasn't watching before showtime.
6128120	6129160	So that's very kind.
6129160	6129760	Thank you.
6129760	6130320	Shout out.
6130880	6131720	I appreciate that.
6131880	6136640	Yeah, it's it's been an interesting year with you and I both participating more on Twitch,
6136640	6140200	especially you, to be quite honest, participating more on Twitch.
6140800	6146120	It's it's really cool, like all the people we've been able to meet this year and network with.
6146120	6148280	And I really hope we get to continue that in next year.
6148480	6154840	And I hope we get to do more of that in person with events like, you know, Twitch Con and just conventions,
6155520	6160920	you know, just fingers and toes crossed that this COVID thing can get a little more under control.
6160920	6165920	I know it's probably going to always be endemic, but, you know, at least maybe we can look at it a little more like the flu
6165920	6169400	and we can actually do things in person again would be really, really wonderful.
6169400	6175600	So it'd be great to meet some of y'all very kind people from the land of Twitch.
6175600	6176120	Thank you.
6176920	6177320	All right.
6177320	6179640	I will be at Dragon Con come hell or high water.
6179640	6180960	If they have one, I'm going.
6180960	6186920	And I don't see why they won't have one at this point, because we know a lot of the basic precautions big shows can take at this point.
6186920	6190640	So I really do want to go to Twitch Con, but.
6191560	6196480	I'm still iffy about conventions anyway, but I want to meet my friends.
6196600	6197480	Yeah, I get it.
6197480	6204200	And I'm and I now get to I now get to officially put myself in the immunocompromised bucket after my recent diagnosis.
6205040	6208240	So, yeah, it's all about precautions, precautions, precautions.
6209000	6211760	Yeah, but honestly, Dragon Con was great.
6212640	6218240	Every like the thing that made it good was that everybody just fucking played by the rules.
6218800	6223880	I didn't see people trying to hide without their mask or something like that or anything like that.
6223880	6234920	Like, I'm sorry, I know I'm talking about a convention that happened months ago, but still, like, I just wish everything was like that, where everybody understood the rules and knew what they needed to do and just fucking followed it.
6234920	6235960	And it was beautiful.
6236280	6239200	Like, I just wish we could get to that for everything.
6239320	6239600	All right.
6239600	6247640	Anyway, off my high horse onto Loki's high horse and a franchise that he has had a lot to say about in the last few months.
6247640	6248160	Right, Loki?
6249120	6264280	Yeah, so there was an interview with CEO Strauss Zelnick of Take-Two in his comments regarding Grand Theft Auto, the definitive trilogy.
6264840	6271320	And here it's just ridiculous how much he downplays what's happened with the thing.
6271640	6276040	So he says, and with the regards to the GTA trilogy, that was actually not a new title.
6276080	6278280	It was a remaster of pre-existing titles.
6278600	6285120	We did have a glitch in the beginning and that glitch was resolved and the title has done just great for the company.
6285120	6286600	So we're very excited.
6286800	6288840	We have an amazing pipeline going forward.
6288880	6290800	One singular glitch, Loki.
6290800	6291720	One, one glitch.
6292200	6293920	There was a glitch in the matrix.
6294320	6297520	Somebody, some oops, all berries.
6297560	6298200	Sorry.
6298200	6299680	It was a little bit of a glitch.
6299760	6300520	Sorry about that.
6300520	6300880	I'm sorry.
6301120	6306240	That's not, no, that is not a glitch.
6306280	6312080	That, that is just a complete failure at putting together a product.
6312120	6318560	Like, no, he's a terrible human being as far as the CEO goes.
6318560	6322560	Like we'll get Kotick out of the way.
6322680	6326520	Uh, as far as we know, he's not, you know, harassing women.
6326520	6328840	So at least he's got that going for him right now.
6328840	6332680	But he's still, it's still just like a very toxic company.
6333280	6336360	Uh, pixel pockets and chat says one glitch as a treat.
6336760	6340040	Uh, he three VL and chat says, did they fix the rain?
6340360	6341720	Did they fix these glitches?
6341720	6343080	They did fix the rain.
6343280	6343840	They did.
6343840	6344400	Finally.
6344600	6348680	They basically, they waited for everybody and make the big definitive list of all the bugs.
6348960	6351120	And then they went and fixed those bugs.
6351800	6352520	How nice.
6353400	6354360	It was just a glitch.
6354560	6356320	It is only a glitch, like glitch.
6357160	6357800	My God.
6359920	6361840	That's how I'm going to review their next game.
6362000	6362960	It's just a little glitch.
6364040	6364880	Moving on.
6364920	6370760	Uh, I don't know how glitchy your list for this will be, but, uh, mine's probably going to show a lot of, uh, I don't know.
6370760	6374000	I don't, I don't know if I played a lot of PlayStation in 2021, to be honest.
6374000	6381000	Cause, uh, a lot of my game time was on my series X, but, um, I'll probably final fantasy 14 when I played on PlayStation for a bit.
6381400	6384200	Uh, I'm talking about the PlayStation wrap up.
6384480	6389800	Uh, it breaks down statistics of your PlayStation four and your PlayStation five play for 2021.
6390160	6392440	I know, aren't we getting towards the end of January?
6392440	6394200	Why aren't we still talking about 2021?
6394200	6396240	Well, this site launched this week.
6396480	6405840	It just took a little bit of time to get going, but you can go to wrapup.playstation.com and you can look at your stats for PlayStation four and five for 2021.
6406160	6412160	Uh, when you connect your PlayStation account, you can see how many hours you spent on different PlayStation game games.
6412160	6416680	Excuse me, the five games you played the most and what trophies you got throughout the year.
6416680	6418440	Cause I know some of you loved a trophy hunt.
6418440	6419040	That's for sure.
6419440	6428080	Um, you can also see your playtime breakdown between PlayStation four and PlayStation five, which in my case, I never touched a PlayStation five with my account.
6428080	6432600	I touched it when I visited Bobby Black Wolf, but it was on his account.
6433080	6436200	Um, Oh, you do get PlayStation VR.
6436200	6441800	So there's that if, if you were using that in the last year, uh, also, uh, some games got like.
6441840	6442920	Global stats.
6442960	6452840	So for example, death stranding director's cuts, the community has traveled 45 million kilometers and delivered 9.4 million packages.
6453360	6455760	12 million hours of returnal had been played.
6456040	6461080	34.6% of Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart players got all of the weapons.
6462040	6462720	So there you go.
6462840	6467720	You have to have played at least 10 hours of games on PlayStation four or five to get your stats.
6468000	6476360	And it's not going to work if you're a PlayStation fly at five player who did not allow full data collection and consent to the additional data collection.
6476680	6477240	Oh, I see.
6477240	6479680	That's how they're going to lure you in is with the cute stats.
6479960	6480520	There you go.
6480880	6484480	So, uh, E3VL says, did they send an email for that?
6484480	6485400	No, I don't think they did.
6485400	6487720	I think they just blasted it with social media posts.
6488000	6490840	Uh, but again, you can get one at wrapup.playstation.com.
6491080	6496840	If you missed it, by the way, Xbox, I don't know if it's still up, but Microsoft had a really cool.
6496880	6513280	Uh, 20th anniversary museum thing, and I'm sorry, I don't have the link, but I'm sure one of y'all in chat, we'll dig it up real quick here and I'll read it out if it's a short link, but that was a really cool thing that showed like what Xbox game have you played the most of, which I was convinced it was going to be no man's sky.
6513280	6524640	But as it turns out, Mass Effect three was my most ever played Xbox game, which makes sense because not only was it like what, 30 hours of single player mode, how much multiplayer and Mass Effect three did we play over the years?
6524760	6525240	A lot.
6525240	6526040	God, so much.
6526040	6526320	Yeah.
6526360	6528640	So I was like, Oh, that's why it was so much.
6528680	6531840	So, um, but that was another really cool thing to check out.
6531840	6534120	And then, yeah, Nintendo kind of sent theirs on email, I think.
6534120	6535240	So kind of neat.
6536160	6536520	All right.
6536560	6537800	Uh, moving on dark soccer.
6538920	6548040	So, um, going back to Twitch, um, there are streamers now, uh, campaigning for a disability pride month.
6548480	6553160	Um, of course they run awareness campaigns for different communities.
6553160	6554120	There's been pride.
6554120	6555280	There's been black history month.
6555280	6556560	Hispanic heritage month.
6557040	6568480	Um, so now, uh, there is a call, um, from the user voice forum, uh, for uplifting, uh, Twitch streamers with disabilities.
6568560	6573600	Um, they're wanting to have, uh, different streamers be highlighted.
6573600	6587880	Um, uh, especially some folks with invisible disabilities as well, um, to, uh, bring awareness that yes, people with various different disabilities do play games and do enjoy them and stream them.
6588200	6592640	So, uh, The, uh, I'll find the link for everybody.
6592640	6601000	It's on the Twitch, uh, twitch.uservoice.com, but I will put the link in chat, uh, for the people who are here.
6601840	6603120	Um, yeah, I'd sign that.
6603120	6604520	I think that's a great idea.
6604760	6613200	Um, I know there's, uh, all sorts of people that stream on this platform and it's always nice to see people different than you who also love video games because video games are for everyone.
6613440	6615080	Here's my small confusion.
6615360	6618760	Um, and I appreciate a little, um, kind education on this.
6619080	6631000	Um, I thought that the term disability was something we were trying to get away from and say differently abled, but then I also saw with this campaign, they were saying disability is not a dirty word.
6631200	6636960	So I'm not, what's, what's the, have we reached a consistently abled was probably created by abled people.
6637320	6637880	Hmm.
6638040	6638560	Interesting.
6638600	6638920	Okay.
6638960	6649240	And it's the same way as a bunch of these neuro-typical people deciding that we need to be called people with autism instead of autistic people without consulting us.
6649920	6650200	Okay.
6651120	6653000	I said someone please educate me on it.
6653000	6655200	So I'm just, I'm just curious about that.
6655320	6660400	So, uh, dark to see in chat says definitely a cause near and dear to my heart as well as my wife's.
6660600	6663200	So I would definitely appreciate something like that from Twitch.
6663480	6664560	Yeah, absolutely.
6664600	6672920	I think the more we see different gamers, uh, and all sorts of people that game, uh, the better across, we get the message that gaming is for everyone.
6672920	6685240	And I think when you have that awareness, like, um, you know, somebody who is, let's just say somebody who is colorblind playing a game and explaining maybe like how they see the game and how things are different.
6685240	6696320	Like it kind of just makes you more aware, like, Oh, this is why, you know, sometimes there's these different settings and games or why a UI might've been designed this way or a certain thing was picked that way.
6696320	6701120	And that's just one of many examples, obviously that I'm, I'm thinking about.
6701280	6703760	So, all right, great.
6703880	6707440	Uh, then definitely, uh, Oh, thank you at dark soccer already linked that in chat there.
6707640	6710680	Uh, it's a long link, so I can't read it for the podcast folks.
6710680	6715280	Sorry, but, uh, it is on the forums at twitch.uservoice.com.
6716600	6717080	Okay.
6717120	6723840	Moving on a few, uh, a few, uh, I guess, humorous stories here to close out our ninth hundredth episode Loki.
6725120	6725680	Yes.
6725680	6733040	So the, the franchise, even wanting more games for, I'm happy to tell you that they're bringing it back.
6733040	6742640	So, uh, microids is they've signed a brand new deal to bringing three brand new Garfield games.
6742680	6743360	That's right.
6743360	6745040	You thought Garfield go was great.
6745040	6746800	You thought Garfield cart was great.
6747680	6750840	I have no idea what they're going to make, but it's going to be Garfield.
6751320	6758880	Um, so yes, let's, let's wait in anticipation for more Garfield.
6759960	6760640	How about not?
6761640	6763360	As long as they don't release it on a Monday.
6764200	6765840	How about just give me some lasagna?
6767040	6767360	Sure.
6767840	6772880	How, how, how do they not have Garfield brand lasagna available at target?
6772880	6775640	Like, how is that, how is that food collaboration?
6775640	6776640	Like that missed opportunity.
6776720	6778160	Why is Garfield in games?
6778160	6780120	Garfield should be in the frozen foods aisle.
6781360	6786840	Yeah, maybe, uh, Ziba and chat says we need more Snoopy games.
6787520	6792440	Sacred Jade said, and most likely Gar Baj to go with Garfield.
6792520	6792840	Get it?
6793000	6793160	Yeah.
6794200	6794840	Womp, womp.
6795040	6798920	Well, the last Garfield game I played was Garfield go.
6800480	6802200	And yep, that's something I played.
6802200	6802720	All right.
6802720	6804720	I, I spent time on that.
6804720	6806360	My precious valuable time.
6806360	6806760	Sorry.
6806760	6807320	That game.
6807360	6807680	Yeah.
6807680	6809320	Well, you know, we all make choices.
6810120	6812000	Look, that was a choice.
6812200	6813200	You were going to say something else?
6813200	6813560	Loki.
6814440	6814880	Yeah.
6814880	6818960	I was going to say now the, the, the Garfield game they really need to make
6818960	6822000	was the, the I'm sorry, John Garfield.
6823200	6825960	Oh, he's like Garfield without Garfield.
6826000	6826720	That's the game.
6826960	6827880	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6828400	6828600	Yeah.
6828600	6830000	Garfield, Garfield would be fine too.
6830000	6835800	No, but I'm talking about the, the kind of kafu like Garfield incantations
6835800	6838720	where he's like this evil thing monster.
6839160	6840720	So I want to see that.
6840960	6844640	How about Garfield's Garfield smash brothers, where we just have all of
6844640	6849880	these Garfield characters and the USA acres crew from Garfield and friends.
6849880	6851560	All of that in one fighting game.
6851600	6856400	I remember, remember who was on us acres, who was a previous podcast
6856400	6859040	guest, Greg burger, also Grimlock.
6859160	6863160	Oh, I will have you know, though, that Garfield was the first bit of
6863160	6866760	DLC for nickel Nickelodeon all-star brawl.
6866800	6867480	Oh, hooray.
6867480	6868920	Isn't a smash brothers game.
6868920	6870840	So yeah, thank you.
6870840	6872760	I've just got tagged with that as well.
6874360	6877520	Bobby Blackwell suggesting Andrew Garfield could be in the game.
6877520	6878080	Yes.
6878600	6881080	Andrew Garfield as Garfield in Garfield.
6881800	6882520	No, I'm sorry.
6882520	6883720	The role went to Chris Pratt.
6887280	6887880	All right.
6888760	6890120	Chris Pratt is normal.
6890480	6890760	He is.
6893920	6894520	All right.
6895520	6901160	For our last story tonight, I could think of nothing better for our 900th
6901160	6906000	episode here on air than to talk about pornography, so let's talk about
6906000	6911840	pornography and how it relates to final fantasy seven and, uh, yeah.
6911840	6915640	So here's what happened in an actual lawmaker meeting for Italy.
6915640	6920480	So these were Italian lawmakers, uh, that were meeting on zoom as a lot of,
6920480	6922040	you know, is happening throughout the world.
6922040	6925360	Uh, and they were funny enough talking about data transparency
6925640	6927440	in political decision-making.
6927960	6932360	And, uh, what happened is that the zoom call was introducing one of last
6932360	6935120	year's Nobel prize winners in physics.
6935160	6937640	Uh, his name was Giorgio Parisi.
6938160	6942960	Uh, and when the zoom call, I guess, cut over, uh, there was a 30 seconds.
6944480	6947560	Of final fantasy seven hentai porn.
6947800	6952640	Now the official VOD for the event, funny enough, has that moment edited out,
6952720	6956200	but you know, once on the internet, always on the internet and it's
6956200	6957840	circulating on Twitter right now.
6958480	6958800	Uh,
6961760	6964200	I couldn't figure out why there was a bunch of pictures going around of like
6964200	6969360	the Italian flag and Tifa, and I was like, what am I missing?
6969360	6970720	And then, then they have the research.
6970760	6973480	I was like, Oh, of course.
6973840	6974440	Of course.
6976360	6980240	Uh, and of course this, and honestly, truly at the end of the day, this
6980240	6982240	has nothing to do with video games.
6982640	6986160	This is somebody horny on the internet who made something horny for horny
6986160	6992600	people, and it got played at a political event by somebody, by either somebody
6992600	6994240	who was horny or a horny hacker.
6994440	6995760	One of those things happen.
6996160	6999920	Um, and that's, that's what it, otherwise this really has nothing to do with final
6999920	7003400	fantasy seven, but our chat of course is lighting up.
7003800	7009200	And mentioning such facts as dark Tetsuya saying, apparently Tifa was trending on
7009200	7011600	Twitter, but there wasn't any explanation.
7012320	7017840	Well, now we know, uh, DJ Rama S says Tifa Lockhart equals Miss Italy 2022.
7018320	7020560	Uh, Mike Def points out Tifa is Italian.
7020800	7021800	Is, is, is she?
7021840	7023920	I don't, I don't, I don't know if that was ever explained because
7023960	7025800	Italy doesn't exist in that universe.
7029320	7029880	All right.
7030680	7031480	So there you go.
7031520	7036600	I remember the, remember I managed to find a copy of final fuck X.
7036600	7041840	I was just about to say, this is the same show that around, it was the pre podcast
7041840	7042080	year.
7042080	7045000	So I would say it was probably around episode 80, 90.
7045480	7053080	You've like under one desk, you found a video disc, a VCD of the actual porn final
7053080	7056640	fuck X, which basically cosplay porn.
7056680	7057640	It was horrible.
7057760	7058320	It was horrible.
7058320	7058880	It was pretty bad.
7058880	7061360	I mean, you don't watch porn for the plot.
7061600	7065520	But, uh, I, and that was the, I had never known before that, that the Japanese porn
7065520	7068440	was censored whenever there was, um, penetration going on.
7068640	7071160	So you would get the mosaic to show genitals.
7071240	7071600	Yeah.
7071880	7075560	But you would see before, before, uh, these women.
7076600	7077440	Did their thing.
7077600	7078920	Their costumes are great.
7078920	7080360	Their costumes were great.
7080360	7081880	They were, one was dressed as Yuna.
7081880	7083080	One was Lulu.
7083440	7084360	Uh, I think that was it.
7084400	7087440	I think it was just a Yuna, Yuna and a Lulu as if those are the only characters.
7087440	7088840	Costumes were amazing.
7088880	7091080	The man, no costumes.
7091680	7092800	They're just generic dudes.
7092960	7093200	Yeah.
7093200	7099000	Because this was, this was pre final fantasy 14 when we realized that, you
7099000	7101960	know, um, slutty armor is truly for everyone.
7102600	7106680	Uh, so maybe, maybe if they ever make a final fuck 14, who knows?
7107120	7110680	Uh, DJ Rama S points out typical of Japanese cosplay porn.
7111160	7113200	You, sir, sound like you've done your research.
7113720	7118000	Um, SSG100Matt says, I was doing a show for work and one of the panelists
7118000	7123880	on the show had a porn pop-up tab with audio blasts during the, uh, show live
7123880	7127200	on air, needless to say the show's archive had to be taken down.
7127480	7131240	This is the exact same thing, but not the exact same thing, but the same
7131240	7137640	thing as that infamous viral video of the, uh, I assure you I'm not a cat.
7137920	7143640	Uh, it's, it's, it's that it's some horrible setting that got left on by
7143640	7147760	accident and why the setting was tuned to final fantasy seven hentai porn.
7148560	7151000	Well, that is the next, that's the next great Italian
7151000	7152560	mystery, to be quite honest.
7155240	7158120	There'll be writing, there'll be exposes on that for years.
7159000	7162160	Anyhow, let's get to the listener round table.
7162160	7163200	And you know what?
7163200	7164680	I, I don't want to jinx it.
7164680	7168040	Cause the minute these words leave my mouth is when problems are going to happen.
7168040	7170200	However, we're in the home stretch of the show.
7170400	7175320	So I feel okay saying we have dropped a total of 22 frames
7175360	7176040	through the whole show.
7176040	7176520	That's it.
7176520	7179000	22 as less than a second has drawn.
7179000	7179880	They weren't good frames.
7179880	7180480	They weren't good.
7180600	7183640	Well, I think they were during the classic game of the week, if I remember right.
7183640	7185000	So they weren't even pictures of us.
7185000	7185680	So it's fine.
7186000	7187440	It was somebody else's game.
7187600	7190200	So, uh, it's, uh, that's it.
7190200	7192760	We've, we've actually been able to maintain an internet connection.
7192760	7193680	Knock on wood, of course.
7193680	7194000	Yes.
7194000	7195280	Now that I've said that goodbye.
7195280	7195720	Good night.
7196000	7199960	But maybe we can actually get some calls on discord tonight.
7199960	7200640	We'll try it.
7200640	7202840	Let's see what's the worst that can happen.
7203160	7208400	So if you want to call on discord, uh, twitch.tv or excuse me, well, twitch.tv
7208400	7210040	slash vog network is where we're live.
7210280	7215640	But if you want to join our discord, go to vog network.com slash discord, and, uh,
7215680	7220560	we will, uh, be awaiting you in the green room and, uh, until we do that,
7220720	7222000	let's check in on the mailbag.
7222000	7224840	I don't remember if we have anything, but, um, I'll check in cause stuff
7224840	7227440	might've accumulated while we've been having internet issues.
7227440	7231760	So participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place you can send us an email.
7232080	7233040	Do we have an emails?
7233640	7234560	We have none.
7234720	7239400	However, I do want to, um, let you know something that I've just seen come
7239400	7240760	to light, thanks to our friend.
7241880	7242200	Okay.
7242840	7248720	Um, uh, Sacramento's main arcade provider has lost a lot of arcade machines
7248720	7251160	due to a fire at the Sacramento drive-in.
7251480	7253800	Oh, I heard about the fire over there.
7254320	7254880	Yeah.
7254920	7260440	Um, there is a go fund me set up, um, to raise $20,000 to help replace
7260440	7262160	the machines and do repairs.
7262560	7264080	Didn't they have a DDR machine over there?
7264120	7264880	I'm pretty sure they did.
7264880	7265400	I thought so.
7265920	7269120	I think one of my friends went to see Rocky horror there and played DDR
7269120	7271960	and frankenfurter, um, cosplay, which is great.
7272520	7277480	Well, I'll put the go fund me up, um, in there, but, um, but if anyone,
7277520	7282840	um, Uh, is interested in contributing, I have reposted and on my own
7282840	7286000	Twitter at dark Sakura, thank you for that.
7286160	7289400	I'm although I'm sad to hear that news, but, um, I feel bad for that.
7289520	7292800	Every year they threatened to shut down and now this year it catches fire.
7292800	7293240	It's sad.
7293240	7295920	Although I guess the project it's, it's all the, uh, like you said, like
7295920	7300080	the arcade games and the, um, uh, concessions area, uh, not the
7300080	7301920	projection, I guess is okay.
7301920	7303640	And that's what the expensive stuff really is.
7303640	7307240	So, but theaters make a lot of their money on concessions.
7307240	7309680	I don't know how that works out when it's a drive-in and probably
7309680	7312800	people are bringing all of their own stuff to eat and drink on
7312800	7314360	anyway, but still it's still.
7315200	7315600	All right.
7316520	7319600	Um, let's check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.
7321920	7323040	No, I don't have any.
7323640	7324680	No, nothing.
7325520	7326120	All right.
7326120	7328280	Well, um, I don't see anybody in the green room.
7328280	7330640	I'll give it one more moment to see if anyone wants to call in.
7330640	7334280	Otherwise, let me check in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.
7334520	7337680	You know, when we don't get any emails, we usually talk about drag race.
7337680	7338720	I'm just going to ask real quick.
7338720	7340440	Cause dark soccer season 14 started.
7340440	7341440	I don't know if you've been watching.
7341760	7343040	I've seen bits and pieces.
7343560	7344280	What's Oh, you have.
7344920	7345520	I cannot.
7345560	7346160	Oh, you can't.
7346160	7346720	Oh, damn.
7346960	7352080	Cause I was going to ask if you have a fave, but, um, there was the one
7352080	7354240	who came out, I think all in polka dots.
7355880	7363640	I watched, I watched the, the walk-ins on someone's channel, but I don't remember.
7363720	7364640	Was that in Nigeria?
7364680	7366080	Might've been Nigeria that did that.
7366640	7369960	That might be, um, there's a lot of strong people this season.
7369960	7373000	My favorites are dia Betty for obvious reasons.
7373120	7377880	Um, and, uh, I also, uh, she's not a big pill.
7377920	7379440	She's a willow pill.
7379720	7381960	I just watched some of Willow pills outfits.
7381960	7382960	Just very glamorous.
7383080	7383320	Yeah.
7383320	7384360	I think Willow pills.
7384760	7385440	Fantastic.
7385440	7389400	I honestly, so, uh, the, I need a way to watch, so I'm going to try to figure
7389400	7393720	something out if you can't see, if you can't watch anything else from drag race
7393720	7399440	this season, watch, cause they, they, they Jack the thing from all stars where they
7399440	7404560	do, uh, um, talent show in the first episode, watch Willow pills talent show.
7404800	7405960	It's amazing.
7406480	7406800	Okay.
7406800	7411040	By the way, apparently Brittany covered, you ought to know and nailed it.
7412000	7413000	Oh, like on her Instagram.
7414120	7417600	Um, I think on like a live stage.
7418360	7419000	Oh, interesting.
7419240	7422880	But Brittany hasn't, I mean, it has to be an old clip cause Brittany hasn't done any
7422880	7427040	performing since the whole, it was reposted by Marina from Marina and the diamonds.
7427360	7428640	It's it's gotta be old though.
7428640	7431080	Cause Brittany hasn't performed since the whole, um, executive
7431080	7432360	ship and that whole thing.
7432640	7433560	She didn't want to perform.
7433600	7436640	She was doing, I don't know how old it is, but I never knew this clip
7436640	7437960	existed and it's pretty awesome.
7438240	7438440	Yeah.
7438480	7441760	I mean, old stuff resurfaces sometimes it still doesn't make it any less great.
7442000	7445560	Um, Kelly Clarkson recently did a hands clean by Alanis.
7445560	7445840	It was great.
7445960	7447000	Kelly Clarkson.
7447640	7448960	I like, she's one of those people.
7448960	7451080	It's like, I always forget how fucking good she is.
7451320	7453040	And then like one of her covers will just float it.
7453040	7456240	Cause she did, she has a cover literally every day because of her talk show.
7456360	7461080	And one of her covers comes across my Twitter feed and I'm like, God, that woman
7461080	7466120	is a gift, you know, not that I, I don't want to speak anything negative about
7466120	7471960	Dolly Parton, put her in a bubble, protect her, save her, but I do feel like Kelly
7471960	7476040	Clarkson is sort of being groomed for that role when Dolly Parton inevitably
7476040	7477680	leaves that leaves this earth.
7477760	7478160	So.
7478720	7479240	There is that.
7480000	7480400	All right.
7480880	7482520	But not for like 25 years.
7482560	7483000	Okay.
7483080	7486200	If, uh, we could, Dolly needs 25 more years.
7486640	7486880	Yeah.
7486880	7488200	You need to talk to share.
7488560	7489080	Okay.
7490320	7492800	And do whatever she taught to Keith Richards.
7494880	7496160	Talk to Keith Richards.
7496160	7498600	That's what Betty should have done was taught to Keith Richards.
7498600	7499320	I'm just saying.
7499920	7500240	All right.
7500920	7503160	Uh, let's, we actually have a call in the green room.
7503200	7504560	I want to get to this cause I have a feeling.
7504560	7506320	I know what this person is calling in to talk about and I
7506320	7507200	definitely want to hear it.
7507480	7511280	So let's get to it and welcome our caller onto the show.
7511320	7512960	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
7512960	7513440	Who's this?
7514720	7515240	Hey everyone.
7515240	7517080	It's a show under Matt.
7517200	7517680	Hey, Matt.
7517680	7518560	It's good to hear from you.
7518560	7521160	If you want to, oh, it's just about to say you can turn on your cam if you want,
7521200	7524960	but some, some people call in and are like, you don't want me to turn my cam on.
7524960	7525280	Trust me.
7525280	7525560	Okay.
7525560	7525880	Don't.
7526000	7526320	All right.
7526840	7527800	Hey, good to see you, Matt.
7528440	7531320	Well, now, now I got to try to concentrate, not to look at the TV.
7531600	7532360	I know.
7532400	7533040	I know.
7533080	7534080	Well, what's on your mind, buddy?
7534920	7537960	So, um, this is a little delayed, but I wanted to call in and talk
7537960	7539640	a little bit about a mag fest.
7539720	7540880	Well, the delay is our fault.
7540880	7541800	Not yours, please.
7541800	7543120	I want to hear about mag fest.
7543120	7543600	How was it?
7544600	7549240	Um, so, well, first off, I wanted to say that I am, uh, I came back, uh,
7549760	7552840	fine and safe, I didn't get sick or anything like that first.
7552840	7556280	First off, who is that cute little fuzz ball behind you?
7557240	7559160	Oh, he's awake.
7559800	7561160	Um, his name is Finn.
7561160	7563120	It's, uh, it's our pop.
7563520	7563840	Okay.
7563840	7567240	Uh, um, what are you French bulldog?
7568120	7570120	Uh, Boston terrier, Boston terrier.
7571080	7572720	Sorry to the facial shape.
7573080	7576800	Sorry to the podcast listeners who can't see the dog, but, um, also
7576800	7579080	not sorry, because I'm always going to ask about the cute animals.
7579120	7579440	Sorry.
7580440	7584640	But also, um, he is, uh, he is, he is on the subscriber chat.
7585040	7591120	I did post a picture a while back, but regardless, um, uh, so yeah, mag fest.
7591240	7598640	Um, uh, so mag fest was obviously very different this year, um, because
7598640	7605720	of all the COVID stuff and, um, they, and it did have a very good time.
7605720	7607520	They did, they did make a lot of changes.
7608240	7616320	Um, it did require a vaccination and, uh, everybody to be masked at all times.
7617360	7622080	And that ended up being very good because I think, uh, I think other
7622160	7625920	conventions that have had similar requirements, they've all kind of
7625920	7631960	worked out and every, and it seems like everybody did, uh, did follow the rules.
7632000	7634240	And that was the case of mag fest as well.
7634400	7634720	Yeah.
7634720	7636760	And I think it's important to point out, you know, I've talked about
7636760	7640800	dragon con and how great that felt, even if it was a little weird, but
7640800	7644480	dragon con was also kind of like not, I mean, I guess it was kind of during
7644480	7648040	the Delta variant and all that, but you guys had to deal with the mag fest,
7648040	7651960	had to deal with the Omicron variant and how that has been really growing.
7651960	7656080	And so like, you know, to be fair, that wasn't a concern at dragon con,
7656080	7659200	whereas, you know, you had this new, highly contagious variant.
7659200	7662080	And I think that made a lot of people question like, Oh shit, is
7662080	7663440	mag fest even going to happen?
7663440	7667320	Although now, you know, no, no company's going to get out of the
7667320	7668800	legal necessities to put that on.
7668800	7672480	So I was kind of curious, like what precautions they were going to taste.
7672480	7674680	They actually required full vaccination and mass.
7674680	7675160	That's good.
7676120	7676440	Yeah.
7676520	7681280	And, um, and even, and even me, like I like with everything that was going
7681280	7687480	on, I kind of like, I didn't decide on going finally until like the day before.
7687920	7691000	Cause it was just like, things were just getting worse.
7691000	7696960	Maryland, the state of Maryland where mag fest is, they had a, did a state of
7696960	7700120	emergency because cases were just so high in the DC area.
7700960	7707480	So, um, I just kind of decided that, you know, I'm going to do all the right things.
7707480	7708320	I'm going to follow the rules.
7708320	7709360	I'm going to wear a mask.
7709400	7713880	I even even wore a face shield and that all seemed to work out.
7714520	7720440	Um, but, um, I just decided that, you know, like I needed to kind of just get
7720440	7728120	out of the house, do something and this felt, you know, I felt like the
7728120	7732080	precautions and everything were pretty safe and going there, everything.
7733080	7735880	Um, there was a lot less capacity.
7736280	7740920	Um, typically make best gets about 22,000 attendees.
7741920	7747720	Um, this year they had just under 11, uh, about half that a little less than half of that.
7748600	7755640	And, um, and, but see, I love dragon con at half capacity, even if it's probably not
7755640	7760600	sustainable, that I loved it at half capacity and, and, you know, and, and
7760600	7764440	magfest was about the same, cause it just, it felt a lot more kind of open.
7764440	7768640	And, um, yeah, there were fewer, you know, machines, there were fewer
7769040	7773720	because in the arcade area, you know, you could just play any, the kind of the nice
7773720	7780040	thing about magfest is that it kind of runs, um, 24 hours through the, through
7780040	7781600	the whole, through the whole weekend.
7782080	7784600	Um, they had to change that because of staff issues.
7785000	7788880	It didn't have people that didn't have enough volunteers to watch the arcade
7788880	7791200	room and expo hall for the whole time.
7791200	7794080	So they had to close from 4 AM to 8 AM.
7795280	7797840	Um, but you know, there were fewer machines.
7797880	7801320	There were, there were fewer guests, a lot of guests dropped out at the last minute.
7801480	7806760	Um, and, but they did do a lot of like nice virtual things.
7806760	7815440	They, um, they did some VR chat stuff where people could watch parts of the
7815480	7817240	parts of the show through VR chat.
7819240	7821600	And, uh, different concerts and everything like that.
7821640	7826880	So, and there were like some stations where you can, uh, see people in VR chat.
7827360	7831800	Um, and interact and interact with those people.
7832200	7833320	Um, that's neat.
7834400	7838440	And they had, and apparently there's a whole, there was a whole, like a
7839520	7841080	conventions that are metaverse.
7841640	7845640	People can go around, they can, and there's been like a little, like a
7845680	7849480	in-joke at magfest with, uh, Danny DeVito shrine.
7849680	7850200	Oh yeah.
7850800	7851000	Yeah.
7851000	7851600	I saw that.
7851800	7852400	I saw that.
7852400	7853400	And the Betty white shrine.
7854200	7856680	Yeah, they have a, they, they, and the Betty white shrine was,
7856680	7858240	that was the new thing this year.
7858320	7858480	Yeah.
7858520	7863480	So, um, but everybody, for the most part, everybody that I saw and every
7864000	7866840	that I kind of interacted with, everybody followed the rules.
7866880	7870240	Everybody wore a mask, everybody kind of social distance.
7870280	7874640	I kind of did, I kind of had to change my, the way that I kind of do.
7875320	7878920	Magfest, uh, typically I have, we have a bunch of friends come.
7879720	7882800	Um, very few of my friends came for obvious reasons.
7882960	7885400	Um, and typically we'd go to the concerts.
7885480	7887120	I didn't really attend to the concerts.
7888200	7892280	And, um, I didn't really attend some, some of their bigger panels.
7892280	7896240	It's just kind of like I poke, I would poke my head and see how busy and just
7896240	7900320	kind of, kind of get the feeling before I kind of like committed to like going
7900360	7904280	into some things, um, just because just like,
7904360	7909080	just wanted to kind of just be as safe as possible. But even like,
7909080	7912640	just like with that, I kind of still had a good time.
7913920	7915160	And, um,
7915200	7920200	I think that there's definitely a space for conventions even in this era of
7922200	7927200	COVID and everything that I think that if shows do the right things and every,
7927200	7931200	and all the attendees do all the right things that I think that it can still,
7932240	7934320	that, uh, conventions can still work in this era.
7934720	7938200	Yeah. Um, you know, I want to, it just goes to show, you know, cause I,
7938200	7942520	and I haven't heard of Magfest having been a super spreader event.
7942800	7946080	Um, and I know with Dragon Con, a lot of people were screaming beforehand,
7946080	7949920	it's going to be a super spreader event and it does go to show that while yes,
7949920	7954240	there is an increased risk with that. You are putting yourself at risk. Um,
7954240	7957840	if you follow the rules, take precautions, you know,
7957840	7958480	and in addition to,
7958480	7962360	I know you isolated for a few days after the fact as did I after Dragon Con,
7962560	7963880	you know, and then get tested and all that stuff.
7963880	7968240	It's like you can kind of make these things work. Um, and you know,
7968320	7971680	Omicron won't be around forever and hopefully not too much longer.
7971680	7975120	And maybe when we get more endemic, maybe we'll still have, I don't know,
7975120	7977200	masks and vaccines at conventions,
7977200	7980680	but maybe we'll be able to have a lot of people back and all that. Um,
7980720	7983600	I still think it would be really good to have a lot of people back and all that.
7983600	7984920	I still think it would be really cool.
7984920	7986360	Some of these things kind of stick around.
7986360	7990280	Like you were talking about the VR chat and the metaverse and allowing people
7990400	7993600	who maybe like physically can't get to magfest,
7993600	7998000	even if COVID wasn't a thing, uh, allow them to still participate.
7998040	7999400	I think that's kind of cool.
7999640	8003520	So I hope that they do kind of keep some of those things that they've had to
8003520	8006960	think about because of COVID involved, um, in the future,
8006960	8011720	just like Dragon Con and Dragon Con TV and expanding that and allowing more home
8011720	8014640	access in that regard and their discord server and all that stuff. You know,
8014640	8017960	a lot of conventions are finding sort of their niches and their ways to sort of
8018200	8021880	expand in the era of COVID. And I think that's a really, really good thing. So.
8021880	8026120	Yeah. And, uh, and just one more thing that I forgot to mention that magfest did,
8026120	8028480	that was kind of, that I thought it was nice. Some people aren't,
8028600	8032800	aren't really too crazy about it. Um, that, um, magfest,
8032920	8036680	they kind of did like their own little contract tracing, um,
8037520	8039920	thing, uh, afterwards, um,
8040120	8043440	everybody who got tested and came back positive,
8043480	8047560	they were encouraged to fill out a Google spreadsheet of
8048360	8051560	where they went, when did they get tested and,
8051960	8053640	and magfest published all the,
8053640	8058280	all the reports and everything of where these people went. Um,
8058320	8061400	they didn't say, you know, like they, everything was anonymous, but, um,
8061440	8065000	they said like, okay, if you were at this panel, uh,
8065000	8069960	one person was tested positive there. So if, so if you were at this panel,
8070360	8074000	maybe you should get yourself tested and they published the whole list.
8074360	8078040	Something unofficial like that kind of happened with dragon con and we actually
8078040	8082680	found out one of the panelists on one of the tracks I was on was positive for
8082680	8086240	COVID and went to dragon con annoyingly with COVID. Um,
8086280	8089920	but the good news was nobody got nobody like everybody on the track,
8089920	8091880	at least all the panelists that talk on this discord,
8092200	8095920	all of them got lab tested, including myself. None of us were positive.
8095960	8100760	So that was like, you know, obviously it sucks. Someone had COVID, but, um,
8100800	8105120	that was really refreshing. So, yeah. And yeah, no.
8105120	8106880	And I think the numbers,
8106960	8111440	so they published the numbers of like how many people like self-reported and
8111440	8116360	they said about 187 people tested positive afterwards out of, you know,
8117280	8121480	well, but out of 11,000, that's actually, you know, and you don't know if
8121920	8125040	reported. So then some of them, so the members might be more, but.
8125120	8128960	But also they maybe didn't get it at magfest because I know when I went to
8128960	8132880	dragon, if I got COVID in Atlanta, it was on public transit.
8133280	8135520	It was not a dragon con. Like I, like it was,
8135560	8139720	there's other elements to getting to the con that I think have to be considered
8139720	8140560	as well.
8141120	8144760	Of course. Yeah. So, um, you know,
8144760	8146320	like I did all the right things.
8146320	8150600	I took a week off and kind of just isolated. I mean, I work from home anyways,
8150680	8154680	but it's, um, I did all the right things. I didn't go out and kill my family.
8154680	8158520	Like a lot of people on the internet claim that anyone who attended magfest was
8158520	8161560	going to do now. It just, um,
8164080	8168040	I mean, I think, I think that you,
8168240	8171880	you just have to assume that everybody who wants to do something public
8173240	8176760	has best intent and that they're going to do the right thing. I think that's,
8176760	8177600	you just have to,
8177720	8182720	you just have to just assume that anyone will kind of do that because not
8183240	8186240	everybody is like a, you know, spring break party boat,
8186440	8189000	everybody not vaccinated and all that stuff.
8189320	8193480	It's a lot of people follow the rules and do all the right things. So.
8194000	8195640	Was it like, you know,
8195640	8200040	going back to kind of the point of magfest and you know you willing to put
8200040	8204840	yourself at the risk and all that stuff. What was it nice to just have a taste?
8204880	8208920	What was it about magfest that made you go, you know what,
8209080	8210320	I'm really glad I did this.
8211680	8215800	Um, I think being, you know, being, being stuck at home for so long,
8215800	8220400	just just like I kind of needed to get out, you know, and, um,
8221320	8222120	just kind of just like,
8222120	8226520	it was just a little taste of just kind of like this is what things were like
8226520	8227040	before.
8227040	8232040	And like I was able to take a semi real vacation in a ways for all this.
8233040	8237000	So it, it's just a, for just mentally, it's just like, it's just,
8238000	8241440	it's nice to kind of just do something even though like there's restrictions
8241440	8246200	and all that stuff. I think it's just nice to just kind of just have some joy,
8246400	8247480	do, do something fun.
8249080	8249960	All right. Well,
8249960	8252560	thank you for calling in tonight and talking about your magfest experience.
8252560	8256800	I appreciate it. And, uh, let's all, and of course, and of course,
8257840	8261520	happy 900th episodes. Thank you. Thank you.
8262040	8262880	I appreciate that.
8263680	8266400	Couldn't have done it without the support of you and so many other people that
8266400	8268320	participate with our show for a long time.
8268560	8271040	I know you haven't been here since episode one, but let's be honest.
8271040	8272480	It kind of feels like it. I was,
8272480	8275320	I think I came in in the red of double digits there, but that's,
8275760	8278960	that is pretty fucking impressive, honestly. And you know what? I don't care.
8279400	8283160	I don't care if episode three was your first show or if episode 900 is your
8283160	8287760	first show. Welcome. Thank you. I hope you, I hope you'd enjoy,
8287840	8290800	hope you enjoy being a part of this because we really enjoy having everybody
8291120	8293600	here. We certainly have. And, uh, of course,
8294640	8296800	congratulations in the house for you and Alan.
8297840	8302160	And I hope it's a really an experience and, uh,
8302520	8303880	don't drive yourself nuts with the move.
8304960	8309480	We hired movers already. So that part is now it's just packet. No,
8309480	8311200	cause when we saved the money, I knew,
8311200	8316160	I said we are saving like an extra dollars to
8316520	8320360	earmark movers. Cause we're not like we're at that age where pizza and beer
8320360	8325080	doesn't work anymore to get movers. It worked on me, which is all.
8325160	8328640	That's very sweet. Thank you. Um, maybe you can help us sort through some,
8328640	8329120	you know what?
8329120	8332800	I need somebody to help set up my office with all these cute little mini arcade
8332800	8336200	cabs and things like that. So maybe I'll, I'll ask you to help me with that.
8336360	8338800	But it is really cute. I will say this, um, because you know,
8338800	8342200	I do this stuff with Rocky horror here locally and the horror film festival and
8342200	8343880	I have, you know, different friend groups through that.
8344160	8347600	And there are a lot of younger folks like in their twenties and so forth.
8347760	8351080	And it is very cute because so many of them are offering to help.
8351080	8353640	Like if you need anything with moving, let me know. And I'm like, Oh God,
8353640	8357920	I love you so much. But trust me, when you get, when you get to 40,
8357920	8360680	your forties, you're like, I'm just paying for movers to do it.
8360720	8362840	And it'll be done in three hours.
8364120	8369240	When we moved into this house. Um, cause keep in mind, I,
8369960	8373080	I think we were just in our very late thirties when we did it,
8374040	8377560	but we did everything ourselves. But you know,
8377560	8379200	with the pinball crowd,
8379600	8384000	we know so many people who have like dollies
8384040	8387800	and lifting jacks and all kinds of stuff.
8387840	8388680	That's true.
8389280	8393920	The, for us, it was like, we'll just, we'll just have our friends. I mean,
8393920	8396280	and I moved a lot of stuff at my Fiat,
8397040	8399120	a lot of stuff fit in that Fiat.
8401120	8404880	Pod culture is asking, will Mr. Smoosh get his own room? No,
8404960	8407160	we're taking his room away, the guest room.
8407240	8412040	So that Alan and I can have separate offices so that hopefully on our gigabit
8412040	8415280	fiber, we can both stream at the same time.
8415680	8418880	That is what we're hoping for the new setup.
8419200	8423920	Mr. Smoosh will get to share his new room and his potty box, uh,
8423960	8428560	with the washer and dryer in a facility. Cause now in newer houses,
8428560	8429760	you don't really put it in the garage.
8429760	8432720	They actually have like a laundry room in the house. So that's what we have. So,
8432760	8436880	um, that's where Mr. Smoosh's, uh, stuff can go as far as I'm concerned.
8437040	8439400	But I'm excited for him to lose a little weight, uh,
8439440	8441640	hoofing it up and down the stairs cause the new house has stairs.
8441800	8443320	So he has to hoof it up and down the stairs.
8443320	8448040	It didn't help Shermy much. Remember? Oh, oh really? Oh yeah. Oh well.
8448280	8451000	But, but, um, uh,
8451040	8454440	DJ Rama asked if Mr. Smoosh got the arcade machine.
8455920	8460960	I, I said that to Dan and he reminded me of when Shermy
8460960	8465640	lived inside of a pole position. Um, remember that? Yes, I do.
8465680	8469160	I do. And the answer to Rama's question, uh, no, um,
8469160	8472560	because our policy right now is less stuff, not more.
8472760	8476360	So we're not taking on any new stuff until after the move is done.
8476600	8481520	But if those machines are, so what he sent me for those, it was, um,
8481560	8483760	it's a cat scratcher, like a wooden scratch,
8483800	8486520	but it looks like an arcade machine and it's really fucking cute.
8486520	8489280	It's like a kitty arcade machine. And so, um,
8489520	8492720	if the move and they're still available after the move,
8492760	8493880	I will happily get them one.
8494160	8497400	Here's something else I need everybody to consider. And, um,
8497600	8501800	this will not be a surprise anyway. So right now we only have Mr. Smoosh,
8501800	8506240	one cat because our landlord only allows one pet. Guess what else happened?
8506320	8508320	Change. Guess what else changes in February?
8508480	8512880	We don't have a landlord anymore. So, so y'all,
8512920	8515120	y'all can read between the lines of what I'm getting at.
8515320	8518360	So don't think about just Mr. Smoosh in this picture.
8518880	8522000	Really careful and see if Mr. Smoosh is okay with other cats.
8522080	8526160	Yeah. We need to find something where it's acceptable for us to do a test run.
8526200	8530080	And Alan and I have to be able to accept the fact that it might not work.
8530080	8532720	And that's the whole reason we ended up independent fosters.
8533080	8534640	And that's the whole reason we ended up with Mr.
8534640	8539360	Smoosh in the first place is that the, the person that found Mr. Smoosh, uh,
8539360	8540640	the friend of a friend that,
8540640	8543560	that realized Smoosh had been abandoned and that something had happened to his
8543560	8546360	eye and all that stuff, uh, tried to take him in,
8546360	8548720	but the other cat was not having them.
8549160	8553240	So she knew she had to find a different, um, uh,
8553280	8557560	family and we were ready and available. Anyway, uh,
8557960	8558800	Quest Buster says-
8558800	8563360	Well there's always going to be an introductory period. A lot of, uh,
8563760	8567760	really good things to do to, to bring a cat in is that when you bring in a new
8567760	8571000	cat, you do need to give them about a week of quarantine.
8571640	8575040	More like if they're young cats. Um,
8575360	8579880	and then a thing that you can do is start feeding them separately and then
8579880	8583200	slowly move their bowls together and feed them at the same time.
8583360	8584200	Yeah.
8584640	8588600	And then that helps with, I've, I fostered a little bit in my time.
8588720	8590000	I've introduced a kitten.
8590680	8594240	You should have seen when I brought my cat Ranma home when old man was alive,
8594560	8596920	when I lived in Alabama, that was an adventure.
8597840	8598680	Um,
8598680	8602040	Dr. Tzuyu says my wife's cat is always rubbing up against my Ms.
8602040	8604320	Pac-Man one up. I think she thinks it's hers now.
8604560	8607040	There's something about those machines that cats love.
8607200	8610040	When I turn on the burger time machine, if smooshes around,
8610240	8613680	his eyes light the fuck up and like,
8613680	8615480	he wants to get right up in that screen.
8615640	8620400	It's something about the lights and the noise. He's so into it. Yeah.
8620400	8621240	It's wild.
8621240	8622320	Midna's completely indifferent.
8622640	8623480	Yeah.
8623480	8625040	All right. Sorry. Sorry, Matt.
8625040	8628040	I know you're calling with your dog and here we are having cat talk.
8629560	8630400	All right.
8630400	8631240	Hi cutie.
8631240	8633160	He's actually, he's actually terrified of cats.
8633240	8634080	Oh, that's cute.
8634560	8635400	Oh, poppers.
8635480	8636120	I love that.
8636120	8637360	He's terrified of cats.
8637360	8642040	He thinks they're dogs, but that they, he thinks that they're dogs, but you know,
8642040	8645680	they just being off put, off putting and, uh, don't want to play with them.
8645920	8648280	Oh, Midna loves dogs.
8648280	8649320	And he, she liked one too.
8649920	8651120	And one too was a big,
8651120	8653920	scary pit bull who was really a little puppy in her heart.
8655160	8656720	All right, Matt, I'm going to let you go,
8656720	8658800	but thank you so much for calling into the show tonight and talking about
8658800	8661800	MagFest. It's really nice to hear that, uh, the conventions are,
8661800	8663200	are making it work. Uh,
8663200	8665240	and maybe we can have a taste of that again,
8665240	8667960	especially as we look to things like TwitchCon and you know,
8667960	8669920	all the stuff we want to go to in 2022.
8670200	8672440	So, all right.
8673320	8673960	Yeah, you too.
8673960	8674640	Take care of my friend.
8675000	8675360	Bye bye.
8676560	8677240	All right.
8677240	8680560	Always good to hear from our folks that are out there listening.
8680840	8683680	I think that was the only call I saw in the green room.
8683680	8684720	So I think with that,
8684720	8688120	we will probably go to wrapping up our show tonight.
8688520	8691200	Thanks again as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
8691240	8692040	And as I said,
8692040	8696240	whether it's your first time listening or your 899th time listening,
8696520	8699440	thank you so much for being a part of the show tonight. Uh,
8699440	8704360	we'll be back in seven days for episode number 901 and maybe the
8704360	8707560	internet issues are a thing of the past. Fingers crossed, toes crossed.
8707600	8709240	There's one other thing I forgot to mention.
8709320	8710160	All right.
8711280	8714360	This today marks, um,
8714400	8718400	my anniversary of living in California now officially more than half of my life.
8718680	8720520	Oh, well, congrats.
8721200	8721880	Thank you.
8721880	8724720	I think we can officially say you're a California girl.
8725000	8727640	The day, uh, Dan and I met in person.
8728080	8729600	Oh, wowee.
8729600	8730360	Oh, that's amazing.
8730360	8731680	So you've known Dan half your life.
8733360	8734520	More than, well, more.
8734520	8736720	Well, yeah, more than half in person, more than half.
8736720	8738080	Wow. Wow.
8738080	8740080	Congrats. Mazel tov.
8740080	8740760	All right.
8740760	8741320	Thank you.
8741320	8744320	Um, so, OK, uh, where was I?
8744320	8746360	Yes, thank you for listening.
8746360	8748440	And if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,
8748600	8750200	tell a friend or two about the show.
8750200	8753000	Even if you hated the show and yet somehow still made it to the end.
8753120	8756040	Tell somebody you think might actually like this stuff.
8757120	8760800	Make a YouTube about this show and everything that's wrong with it.
8761160	8763120	And Logie will watch it.
8763120	8765200	No, seriously, tell a friend or two about the show.
8765200	8767920	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8767920	8771640	But we want more voices here to get those thoughts and opinions out on the air.
8773160	8777040	If you want to join our discord, we'd love to have you vognetwork.com
8777040	8782240	slash discord, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify,
8782240	8784680	wherever it is you actually Spotify does have reviews now.
8784960	8787160	So those actually do work on there.
8787160	8789920	So please, if you haven't yet rated us there, please consider it.
8790160	8792320	And all of that goes an awful long way.
8792320	8794480	And again, just thank you for being a part of it.
8794760	8797400	We really couldn't have got to episode 900 without your help.
8797640	8801000	And here's here's hoping for a thousand.
8802800	8805160	That's it. I can't think of anything else to say.
8805320	8807600	So let's get to the final thoughts.
8807600	8811280	Dark Sakura, I know you're probably going to go off and start your killing
8811280	8813720	and dead by daylight, so I'll let you go first with your final thought.
8814560	8816840	Um, I'm going to try to make it a full stream.
8816840	8820440	I'm still feeling a little bit under the weather, but we'll try.
8820520	8823040	I'm on my second round of antibiotics. Can you believe it?
8823080	8824960	Oh, boy. Feel better.
8824960	8826840	Thank you. Later, caters.
8826840	8829160	At least at least it wasn't COVID.
8829160	8831000	At least it was a COVID.
8831000	8832520	I know it's like the saying of the year.
8832520	8834560	All right. Take care of Dark Sakura.
8834560	8836360	All right. Bye, everybody.
8836360	8839240	Loki, I'll go to you for your final thought.
8839240	8841720	My final thought is that I'm
8842200	8845880	going to try to put out another episode here pretty soon of my YouTube series.
8846240	8848360	I'm still working on a very large builder right now.
8848440	8850760	It's a starter base.
8850760	8852760	It's enormous.
8852760	8855160	So hopefully they'll be coming soon.
8857000	8859840	And my final thought is I am fucking gagged that we made it
8859840	8861800	through the whole episode without an Internet outage
8861800	8863800	when I was sitting here at the very beginning going,
8863800	8866680	well, it's probably going to be a month before we can fix.
8867440	8872120	Of course, if I if I say it, the opposite will be willed into existence.
8872120	8875680	But you know what? I'll take it because I love having you folks here live
8875840	8878240	and not having to deal with all those shitty hiccups.
8878240	8879880	So thank you.
8879880	8882960	And hey, if my Internet can hold out, maybe I can squeeze in
8882960	8884480	a few more personal streams.
8884480	8887880	I'm probably not going to be streaming a lot a lot until I get to the new place.
8887880	8892000	I've been wanting to say for so long that, like Alan
8892040	8894800	and I have these ways that we're going to fix some of our problems.
8894800	8897840	And now I can find out kind of openly talk about it, which is great.
8897960	8901120	But it will probably slow down my personal streaming for a little bit.
8901120	8904360	But in February, it's on. It is on.
8904840	8907240	All right. That is going to do it.
8907480	8910720	Thank you again for listening to our show. Have fun gaming.
8911480	8914440	Everyone games and should have fun playing some games.
8914760	8917040	Make this a welcoming space for everyone.
8917320	8921080	We'll see you in seven days to do this all again with episode number nine hundred
8921080	8923040	and one. I hope that sounds good.
