00:22.620 --> 00:25.420

00:25.420 --> 00:29.260
These are a few headlines rolled into one theme, now it's time for the 900th episode

00:29.260 --> 00:33.100
of Orange Lounge Radio, with your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give you

00:33.100 --> 00:36.140
details on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

00:36.140 --> 00:38.140
where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.140 --> 00:47.620
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:47.620 --> 00:49.940
every gamer has a voice.

00:49.940 --> 00:57.900
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 900 of our

00:57.900 --> 01:05.100
show that is 900 for tonight, January the 23rd of 2022.

01:05.100 --> 01:11.980
And with me as they have been since June of 2002, say hello to my co-hosts.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.260
First off, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:14.260 --> 01:15.260
Hi there.

01:15.260 --> 01:16.260
Hi.

01:16.260 --> 01:17.260
Hi.

01:17.260 --> 01:18.260
Congratulations on 900 episodes.

01:18.260 --> 01:19.260
You too.

01:19.260 --> 01:24.460
If you could sum up 900 episodes of OLR in one word, what would it be?

01:24.460 --> 01:25.460
What?

01:25.460 --> 01:27.380
Okay, that's a good one.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.660
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:29.660 --> 01:30.660
Hi.

01:30.660 --> 01:31.900
Hi, Loki.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.900
Congrats on 900 episodes.

01:33.900 --> 01:34.900
Yes.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.060
I'll ask you the same question.

01:36.060 --> 01:40.180
If you could sum up 900 episodes in one word, what would that be?

01:40.180 --> 01:42.900
Okay, great.

01:42.900 --> 01:43.900
Long.

01:43.900 --> 01:50.900
Anyway, a big hi to our chat because we didn't know, did you have a real answer?

01:50.900 --> 01:51.900
That's it.

01:51.900 --> 01:52.900
Okay.

01:52.900 --> 01:53.900
Long.

01:54.420 --> 01:59.780
Um, I think, I think mine might be something like, oh my God, if you remember that old

01:59.780 --> 02:10.940
YouTube except the internet in the past few episodes will be, oh my God, be something

02:10.940 --> 02:11.940
like that.

02:11.940 --> 02:12.980
But I'm going to get to that in a minute.

02:12.980 --> 02:16.620
Uh, I do want to acknowledge our chat room of course, because we do tape live every Sunday

02:16.620 --> 02:21.480
night at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash a VOG network, nine o'clock Eastern

02:21.480 --> 02:24.800
six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby black Wolf show.

02:24.800 --> 02:30.520
And I, I, I usually, I don't read the, um, bit cheers and the sub donations and things

02:30.520 --> 02:32.480
like that until the end of the show.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.760
Cause um, you know, a lot, I know a lot of like normal twitch streams you watch kind

02:35.760 --> 02:37.040
of read that and say, thank you for that.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.040
Thank you for that.

02:38.040 --> 02:42.080
Um, but we are trying to record for our podcast, which people can of course download an iTunes,

02:42.080 --> 02:45.000
Spotify, whatever their favorite podcast app is.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.600
Um, but you go, oh my gosh, like I see you guys donating lots of bits.

02:49.600 --> 02:55.320
I'm seeing, oh my God, there's another five subs, 900 bits, uh, that, and that's not like

02:55.320 --> 02:57.980
a small amount of money, uh, that you guys are saying congrats.

02:57.980 --> 03:00.480
And I'm like, oh my God, do we just get a hype train all the way to level five?

03:00.480 --> 03:01.480
I think we did.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.480
I think we did.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.480
Oh my God.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.480
Thank you so much.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.040
And I just big love to the community.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.920
We, we really wouldn't get to 900 episodes without you guys.

03:09.920 --> 03:15.720
Um, those of you that stick with us, especially because I know, uh, with the live stuff, um,

03:15.720 --> 03:19.560
and we love our podcast listeners too, please don't get me wrong, but the live folks have

03:19.560 --> 03:23.380
been especially putting up with some crap lately because of all these internet issues

03:23.380 --> 03:24.380
I've been having.

03:24.380 --> 03:26.900
Um, I have bad news and I have good news.

03:26.900 --> 03:31.080
I'm ready to talk about this announcement I've been teasing for a while, which, which

03:31.080 --> 03:34.800
most of you have figured out, but let me start with the bad news.

03:34.800 --> 03:39.560
Um, the bad news is I don't see these internet problems getting fixed anytime soon.

03:39.560 --> 03:44.520
Uh, in fact, I fully expect the internet to crap out at 7 15 Pacific tonight as it did

03:44.520 --> 03:48.840
the last couple of weeks as it's been, uh, throughout the week on my personal connection.

03:48.840 --> 03:54.440
Um, I'm trying, but my cable company doesn't seem to understand what the problem is and

03:54.440 --> 03:57.440
it's, uh, it's getting pretty ridiculous to be quite honest.

03:57.440 --> 04:01.360
Um, so unfortunately I'm not sure much can change with that.

04:01.360 --> 04:04.440
However, uh, we did do some preventative things behind the scenes.

04:04.440 --> 04:09.800
For example, if the show looks a little fuzzier or a little choppier than maybe you're used

04:09.800 --> 04:12.720
to, and this is only for Twitch, this wouldn't affect the podcast at all.

04:12.720 --> 04:18.800
Um, but it's because I purposely did a lower bit rate and only 30 frames a second instead

04:18.800 --> 04:24.440
of 60 to try to push less video out the door so that if there is a hiccup, I'm hoping our

04:24.440 --> 04:26.440
audio will still get through if nothing else.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.960
That is something I was noticing in the past couple episodes in the feed.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.680
It's just the video got really choppy and laggy and you guys could kind of still hear

04:33.680 --> 04:34.680
things.

04:34.680 --> 04:39.920
So I'm hoping maybe making some small changes like that, um, will, uh, help those issues.

04:39.920 --> 04:40.920
So we'll see.

04:40.920 --> 04:41.920
Hopefully, hopefully.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.480
Um, now let's talk about the good news.

04:44.480 --> 04:51.520
The good news is I know that this isn't going to happen beyond February because, um, last

04:51.520 --> 04:57.640
summer Alan and I bought a house and you might be thinking, what is taken?

04:57.640 --> 04:59.880
So don't you usually move into a house the next one?

04:59.880 --> 05:02.000
Well, we bought a new house.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.480
We did things a little differently because, uh, we're not like rich or anything like that.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.120
I don't want you to think it's, it's that sort of situation.

05:09.120 --> 05:13.800
But, um, what happened is that the, the market in real estate was crazy and we were bidding

05:13.800 --> 05:17.760
on houses and getting outbid by, I'm telling you $50,000.

05:17.760 --> 05:22.200
We were, we looked at one house in the pocket, oh my God, it would have been beautiful.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.880
Like it would have been great for us.

05:23.880 --> 05:29.600
It had an upstairs loft that would have made the best studio type of area or like arcade

05:29.600 --> 05:30.600
or something like that.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.760
But unfortunately we got outbid by $50,000 in that place.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.280
So it wasn't meant to be.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.140
Um, however, we got sick of playing that game and you know what?

05:38.160 --> 05:42.280
We found some new construction and we were like, time, time's on our side.

05:42.280 --> 05:45.180
We can wait a little longer and save up and things like that.

05:45.180 --> 05:47.000
And, and let's do, let's do this.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.360
Let's go for the house this way.

05:48.360 --> 05:53.240
So, um, we, we bought some new construction and now the construction is finally finishing.

05:53.240 --> 05:57.520
We've been quiet about it for a long time because, um, out of respect to our current

05:57.520 --> 06:00.560
living situation, we don't know who knows who and things like that.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.740
And just, I'm not wanting to, you know, curse anything or what have you, uh, we just didn't

06:04.740 --> 06:06.980
say anything about it until now.

06:06.980 --> 06:11.980
So the good news with that is that, um, after February, so there's not going to be a show

06:11.980 --> 06:15.020
February 20th, because that'll be the weekend that I'm changing.

06:15.020 --> 06:22.320
Uh, but then after that, uh, there will, um, uh, no longer be the old cable provider that

06:22.320 --> 06:23.320
I use now.

06:23.320 --> 06:28.500
Uh, there's a different fiber internet provider out there and I'm just going to hope it's

06:28.500 --> 06:30.580
a whole lot better experience.

06:30.580 --> 06:31.580
That's for darn sure.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.020
So there is that.

06:33.020 --> 06:35.580
Um, so thank you guys very much for the kind words and chat.

06:35.580 --> 06:36.580
I appreciate that.

06:36.700 --> 06:37.700
Continued bits.

06:37.700 --> 06:38.700
Thank you guys so much.

06:38.700 --> 06:39.700
Oh my gosh.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.140
Really, really appreciate that.

06:41.140 --> 06:42.140
Oh yeah.

06:42.140 --> 06:45.140
You know, and what I love about, and I'm not going to say who the provider is because then

06:45.140 --> 06:50.580
you guys are just going to tell me the, all the negative stuff about that company.

06:50.580 --> 06:54.940
Let me give you, um, this in perspective, there's two companies I can pick from our

06:54.940 --> 06:57.180
current company or this new one.

06:57.180 --> 06:58.480
Which one do you think I'm going with?

06:58.480 --> 07:00.100
No matter what y'all have to say.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.020
Yeah, I'm going with the new one.

07:02.020 --> 07:03.620
Um, but then I see about it.

07:03.620 --> 07:06.060
They don't force a TV package down our throat.

07:06.060 --> 07:10.100
Like it's, it's almost made for people who have cut the cord and it's wonderful.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.820
I'm, I'm so excited about it.

07:11.820 --> 07:12.820
That's for sure.

07:12.820 --> 07:14.300
So, um, yeah, there you go.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.300
That's my big announcement.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.300
I wanted to talk about.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.300
Thank you.

07:17.300 --> 07:18.300
Thank you.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.240
Um, one thing I should address, cause I think people are going to wonder and I think people

07:20.240 --> 07:23.260
have been wondering this for awhile, so I think we should probably bring it up.

07:23.260 --> 07:27.820
Um, and the question, or I guess more of the statement is that, um, the, the thing that's

07:27.820 --> 07:31.780
going to be a little different when, um, Alan and I move into the new house, um, there's

07:31.780 --> 07:32.900
not a studio in it.

07:32.900 --> 07:37.220
Uh, well, fortunately we had to go for a house of a certain size and there's not going to

07:37.220 --> 07:40.100
be a studio in the house.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.340
Um, so there isn't really a studio number eight.

07:42.340 --> 07:46.520
Um, so I guess what I'm trying to say is that for now, uh, OLR is just going to continue

07:46.520 --> 07:52.100
in the virtual form that it has been, um, never say never, I guess, because, you know,

07:52.100 --> 07:56.380
maybe one of the offices can be, I don't, I just don't know how it would work on Twitch,

07:56.380 --> 07:57.640
but never say never.

07:57.640 --> 08:01.980
So I don't want to say like forever, but, um, this is just the way we're going to proceed,

08:01.980 --> 08:03.300
uh, for the future.

08:03.300 --> 08:06.180
Um, you know, and COVID is still a thing too.

08:06.180 --> 08:09.940
You know, um, it's a lot smarter that way, honestly, it, it, yeah.

08:09.940 --> 08:14.000
And like, for example, last night I hosted a show at a theater.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.320
It was a great show.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.500
I had a great time.

08:16.500 --> 08:21.180
Uh, it was a tribute to twin peaks and we actually had, um, like Laura Palmer's actress,

08:21.180 --> 08:23.380
Cheryl Lee was actually there in attendance and so forth.

08:23.380 --> 08:27.540
But obviously doing that and hosting that, even though, you know, I wore a mask and vaccinated,

08:27.540 --> 08:31.860
I took all the precautions and that I tried to minimize my interactions close with people.

08:31.860 --> 08:33.580
I still did a risky thing.

08:33.580 --> 08:37.640
And for that reason, I didn't do anything a few days before I'm not going to do anything

08:37.640 --> 08:42.520
a few days after, just to make sure I'm in the clear with all that stuff with the precautions.

08:42.520 --> 08:47.020
If we had had a show in person tonight, that wouldn't really be the case, right?

08:47.020 --> 08:50.800
Like I could, because I took a risk, I could be exposing the co-host.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.380
So anyway, I think y'all know what I'm getting at is that just for a little while, uh, for

08:54.380 --> 08:56.860
the foreseeable future, we're going to continue this virtual thing.

08:56.860 --> 08:59.580
So, um, and it's been working out.

08:59.580 --> 09:03.580
Um, and things are going to get reconfigured, which I think will be really, so the show's

09:03.580 --> 09:07.700
going to look different in about three weeks because I'm already stewing with some ideas

09:07.700 --> 09:11.340
and I think it will be at the end of the day, really cool.

09:11.340 --> 09:16.400
So please, uh, hang in there, stick with us and thank you for being here.

09:16.400 --> 09:20.020
Let's let's, let's see if we can, let's see if we've got enough gas in the tank to get

09:20.020 --> 09:21.060
to a thousand.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.060
What do you say?

09:22.060 --> 09:24.060
I think we'll do it.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.060
Let's do it.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.620
All right.

09:26.620 --> 09:27.620
Let's start off.

09:27.740 --> 09:31.940
That's our big news, but man, there was some big news in the gaming industry this week.

09:31.940 --> 09:32.940
That's for sure.

09:32.940 --> 09:37.780
News so big, Bobby was like, we got to go live now to talk about this.

09:37.780 --> 09:40.660
I was like, yeah, let's, let's, let's talk about it, but there's still stuff to talk

09:40.660 --> 09:41.660
about.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.160
And I want to talk about it with you all tonight.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.700
So Loki, can you get into the kickoff topic tonight?

09:46.700 --> 09:47.700
Yeah.

09:47.700 --> 09:52.460
So Microsoft decided, Hey, you know how you keep asking us about a relationship with Activision

09:52.460 --> 09:54.860
Blizzard and it's a very touchy subject.

09:54.860 --> 09:58.420
We'll just buy them and make it less awkward or more awkward.

09:58.420 --> 09:59.420
I'm not really sure.

09:59.420 --> 10:05.060
So, um, they decided to purchase or at least they intend on purchasing Activision Blizzard

10:05.060 --> 10:07.020
for $70 billion.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.900
Uh, that also include King as well.

10:09.900 --> 10:14.760
So Microsoft will own all of the franchises at that point.

10:14.760 --> 10:21.140
And then, um, yeah, so it's, it is probably one of the largest purchases that, you know,

10:21.140 --> 10:24.200
it's been made in the video game industry, I think.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.680
It's the part that I thought was fascinating.

10:26.680 --> 10:31.600
It's doesn't make Microsoft the biggest company still, it is still behind Sony and Tencent,

10:31.600 --> 10:32.600
which I think is interesting.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.600
Yeah.

10:33.600 --> 10:39.280
So, um, but still though, I mean, they're, they have quite the, the catalog now, um,

10:39.280 --> 10:42.080
right now there's still a lot up in the air.

10:42.080 --> 10:46.800
They basically done this, they've kind of said the same things that they did with Bethesda

10:46.800 --> 10:51.320
where it's like, okay, yeah, we're going to go ahead and honor our agreements that were

10:51.320 --> 10:55.160
in place already, you know, with like call of duty and stuff like that.

10:55.160 --> 11:03.080
So they'll be coming to multiple systems for now, um, in the future, maybe not.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.080
We'll see.

11:04.080 --> 11:09.560
Um, but yeah, it'd be interesting to see maybe if they bring like some of these titles that

11:09.560 --> 11:14.520
aren't necessarily on Xbox to Xbox, like world of Warcraft or something like that.

11:14.520 --> 11:20.900
Um, but we also see, of course, them planning on bringing Activision Blizzard games to game

11:20.940 --> 11:26.940
pass, which really is probably the end game with this anyways, it's just adding a ton

11:26.940 --> 11:32.620
of, ton more content to, uh, games pass in general.

11:32.620 --> 11:36.860
And you know, there's been obviously some questions like, is Bobby Kotick going to still

11:36.860 --> 11:39.500
be on board for this right now?

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
Yes.

11:40.500 --> 11:44.260
But I'm not sure after the deal closes, if he will stay, I think they are probably going

11:44.260 --> 11:45.260
to let him go.

11:46.260 --> 11:52.060
A lot of the stuff that's come out later in the week, Loki is, um, pretty much the plan

11:52.060 --> 11:57.420
is that there is no plan for Bobby Kotick after the deal is closed, but they do have

11:57.420 --> 12:01.640
to close the deal because, you know, there's going to be, I'm sure regulators are going

12:01.640 --> 12:07.420
to look at, look at this hell one representative, I think it was Jerry Nadler, um, already kind

12:07.420 --> 12:11.980
of wrote a tweet about, you know, this sounds like it could be, you know, it needs to go

12:11.980 --> 12:14.260
under the microscope and this whole thing.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.500
Oh, this already talks about antitrust.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.540
Oh, Dark Sakura, not all reps feel this way, right?

12:19.540 --> 12:26.340
Well, I mean, the, uh, I even hate saying her name, but, uh, Marjorie Taylor Greene

12:26.340 --> 12:32.180
sold $15,000 worth of stock the day Microsoft announced that they were going to buy the

12:32.180 --> 12:33.180
company.

12:33.180 --> 12:35.340
We'll just refer to that one as her.

12:35.340 --> 12:36.340
Her.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.340
Um, which.

12:37.340 --> 12:42.340
They shouldn't be trading stocks in the first place, but that's a whole other thing.

12:42.340 --> 12:52.060
Well, um, that resulted in, since their stock went up that day, that was, I mean, it didn't

12:52.060 --> 12:56.020
go up a whole lot, but that gave her about another 200 bucks in capital gains.

12:56.020 --> 13:02.100
So, um, the thing is, is that, I mean, if they're going to get Martha Stewart for this,

13:02.100 --> 13:07.740
they need to be looking at her next, just saying she had to have known something.

13:08.620 --> 13:13.780
But I, it's, I just don't see this getting stopped for antitrust.

13:13.780 --> 13:18.220
I mean, I'm not also a legal mind, so I'm not going to try to be an armchair critic

13:18.220 --> 13:23.100
in that regard, but I just, you know, again, Microsoft is not going to be the biggest company

13:23.100 --> 13:24.220
in this regard.

13:24.220 --> 13:28.220
We know that there's going to be at least two others that are still bigger, um, and

13:28.220 --> 13:29.220
it'd be different.

13:29.220 --> 13:35.300
Like if they purchase Sony or purchase like Nintendo, that would be a little bit, yeah.

13:35.300 --> 13:42.340
I mean, the, the, I think the theory that Microsoft goes down a meta route where you

13:42.340 --> 13:48.460
have Microsoft and then Xbox game studios is its own separate company under Microsoft.

13:48.460 --> 13:53.740
That is probably the closest thing to a, how this plays out that I think it may ultimately

13:53.740 --> 13:54.740
end up.

13:54.740 --> 14:00.820
Um, I've also like, there was the topic that came up that sometimes companies will offload

14:00.820 --> 14:03.580
part of the sale in order to help it go through.

14:03.580 --> 14:07.700
Um, and an excellent example was brought up in the bonus stream we did earlier in the

14:07.700 --> 14:15.060
week where, um, when Disney bought Fox, which was kind of this in the entertainment world,

14:15.060 --> 14:16.060
right?

14:16.060 --> 14:21.180
When Disney bought Fox, uh, they had to unload the Fox sports channels because it was going

14:21.180 --> 14:25.780
to create like a sports monopoly probably because of whatever ABC has and that whole

14:25.780 --> 14:26.780
mess.

14:26.780 --> 14:27.780
So they had to unload that.

14:27.780 --> 14:30.300
They have like ESPN or something like that.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.740
Yeah, I think it's something around that.

14:31.740 --> 14:34.140
So it would have created some type of like sports monopoly.

14:34.140 --> 14:39.380
So the thought was that, well, maybe like if anything seems like it's spin off-able

14:39.380 --> 14:43.140
from ABK, it feels like it's King.

14:43.140 --> 14:45.180
And I'm not saying that King is bad.

14:45.180 --> 14:48.500
Please do not hear me say, I'm not saying they're expendable or that I'm not, that's

14:48.500 --> 14:50.020
not what I'm saying.

14:50.020 --> 14:54.580
But what I'm saying is that what I believe Microsoft really wants is the A and B side

14:54.580 --> 15:02.560
of things because Microsoft's mobile strategy seems to be game pass, the cloud, that kind

15:02.560 --> 15:03.560
of gaming.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.980
That's their mobile strategy.

15:04.980 --> 15:08.860
I'm not sure, and I may be wrong and that's fine.

15:08.860 --> 15:13.140
I'm not sure a mobile developer is what they really want.

15:13.140 --> 15:17.380
And maybe if they kind of unload that, then it's not going to give the perception that

15:17.380 --> 15:21.940
Microsoft has some weird, or they're going for a mobile thing, which they, which when

15:21.940 --> 15:26.680
the Windows phone is no longer a thing, I don't see as an issue anyway.

15:26.680 --> 15:32.480
So I actually, I don't know if King gets offloaded because I'm not sure Microsoft having a mobile

15:32.480 --> 15:34.140
developer means anything.

15:34.140 --> 15:38.380
All of their, all of their opportunities in mobile have flopped.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.620
And I think now it's about cloud gaming.

15:40.620 --> 15:42.940
So we'll see.

15:42.940 --> 15:46.540
Some other comments in chat about what gets spun off.

15:46.540 --> 15:52.180
Rama points out when Walgreens bought Rite Aid, they had to unload half the stores for

15:52.180 --> 15:55.620
similar reasons, but thank God they kept thrifty ice cream.

15:55.620 --> 15:58.220
I added that part because that's the most important.

15:58.220 --> 15:59.220
That's the most important.

15:59.220 --> 16:03.500
Well, yeah, I don't think, well, they don't have that in all locations, but I know like

16:03.500 --> 16:06.780
the one we have over here in Folsom mentions thrifty ice cream.

16:06.780 --> 16:09.980
They still have thrifty ice cream counters in Sacramento, which is great and probably

16:09.980 --> 16:11.140
some other parts in Orkal.

16:11.140 --> 16:12.140
It's great.

16:12.140 --> 16:13.140
Yeah.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.140
There was one by Matt.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.140
I haven't been to one of those and well, yeah.

16:15.740 --> 16:19.700
I could give, I could give fuck all where my pills come from as long as I get thrifty

16:19.700 --> 16:20.700
ice cream.

16:20.700 --> 16:21.700
That's all.

16:21.700 --> 16:22.700
Let's see.

16:22.700 --> 16:27.220
Pod culture is talking about Sprint and T-Mobile had to unload some stuff for that to happen.

16:27.220 --> 16:33.160
And DJ Rama says that was Boost Mobile, the Dish Network and shut down Virgin Mobile.

16:33.160 --> 16:39.180
So I can tell you quite a bit about that first hand, right.

16:39.180 --> 16:46.160
And then Boost went to.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.160
It was Dish.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.100
Yeah, Boost went to Dish.

16:49.100 --> 16:53.900
And then they're still under and then they went off to T-Mobile.

16:53.900 --> 16:58.980
So there was a sort of a big series of transitions with that.

16:58.980 --> 17:06.640
And we may see something weird where some of Activision Studios get spun off.

17:06.640 --> 17:13.080
We may, I mean, we could, I don't want to sound too tinfoil hatty, but I could see a

17:13.080 --> 17:17.920
situation where Blizzard gets spun off into an independent thing again or get sold to

17:17.920 --> 17:18.920
someone else.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.740
I could see that.

17:20.740 --> 17:26.740
I don't think that makes sense with Microsoft strategy, but I could see it.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.720
I don't think anything should be off the table in that regard.

17:29.720 --> 17:32.880
So anyway.

17:32.880 --> 17:38.980
So yeah, Loki, any other headlines from this whole thing, because this has been nonstop

17:38.980 --> 17:42.960
headlines all week on this.

17:42.960 --> 17:48.780
There's been a lot of like kind of asking for comment regarding basically just the work

17:48.780 --> 17:54.720
situation that Activision Blizzard employees are kind of a part of right now.

17:54.720 --> 18:00.800
And they kind of just been shrugging it off, especially when we're talking about unionization,

18:00.800 --> 18:05.520
which I know we'll get into that a little bit later, but basically saying that they're

18:05.520 --> 18:14.080
not trying to come across as experts in what's going on with unions, but I don't know.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.680
So we'll see.

18:16.680 --> 18:22.880
I'm hoping with Microsoft kind of overseeing them now that conditions will be better.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.600
So we'll hopefully see that happening.

18:25.600 --> 18:30.420
I'm not going to profess to know exactly what those employees are going through, but I will

18:30.420 --> 18:36.340
venture a guess that the attitude may be one of, could it get any like, at least it

18:36.340 --> 18:42.500
won't get any worse or like could Microsoft buying us be any worse than where we were

18:42.500 --> 18:43.500
going?

18:43.500 --> 18:48.060
Well, yeah, I think, well, if they do get rid of Bobby Kotick, I think that's going

18:48.060 --> 18:53.100
to be a good sign that they're kind of trying to right the ship of it.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.780
So we'll see what happens.

18:55.780 --> 18:56.840
Only time will tell.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.380
I don't really know what the work culture.

18:58.380 --> 19:02.060
I mean, I can only imagine that work culture in like Microsoft or something like that is

19:02.060 --> 19:03.240
better.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.940
I don't think it, we haven't heard a lot of stories coming out of Microsoft.

19:06.940 --> 19:11.020
I'm sure there's crunch and stuff like that still, but we haven't heard of anything like

19:11.020 --> 19:12.020
bad.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.020
Yeah.

19:13.020 --> 19:18.840
Well, DJ Ramis in our chat says, as a former Microsoft employee, I can tell you firsthand

19:18.840 --> 19:21.760
that Microsoft will take care of you as an employee, seriously.

19:21.760 --> 19:26.380
And I think generally, I think the industry regards Phil Spencer pretty highly and what

19:26.380 --> 19:28.580
he's done for Xbox.

19:28.580 --> 19:35.060
And I think things feel, you know, will be like the fact that it will be him running

19:35.060 --> 19:41.260
that and not Bobby Kotick does give me some warm fuzzies.

19:41.260 --> 19:47.100
The part that gives me cold pricklies is that Bobby Kotick is going to get like a quarter

19:47.100 --> 19:49.060
of a billion dollar payout when he leaves.

19:49.060 --> 19:51.920
If all this, I mean, nobody really knows the terms of the deal.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.700
And I know there's stuff that's around the Internet about the contracts and stuff that

19:54.700 --> 19:59.420
I think are from a year ago though, but still, it's very clear he will get some very large

19:59.420 --> 20:01.060
payout when he goes.

20:01.060 --> 20:04.860
And that sucks because it feels like the bad guy's winning.

20:04.860 --> 20:08.060
He shouldn't get shit like, like let's be honest.

20:08.060 --> 20:09.580
How did this even happen?

20:09.580 --> 20:14.200
How is, I mean, this, when I saw the headline, when I woke up, which is funny, cause I slept

20:14.200 --> 20:16.620
in on Tuesday cause I actually had the day off.

20:16.620 --> 20:24.040
And when I woke up, I was like, you know, that wasn't on my 2022 bingo card for gaming.

20:24.040 --> 20:29.560
It wasn't in the prediction jar that we did here on OLR last week, but it really should

20:29.560 --> 20:30.560
have been.

20:30.560 --> 20:36.360
Like when I, when I kind of heard that, I was like, you know, I'm not surprised.

20:36.360 --> 20:42.200
Like we, we kind of knew Activision Blizzard was fucked and they knew it.

20:42.200 --> 20:47.600
And, and you hear these stories about they were trying to offload the company in November.

20:47.600 --> 20:52.700
Well first they were going to buy this, this is the part that blows my mind.

20:52.700 --> 20:58.860
They were trying to buy a company like Kotaku or GamesRadar to change the narrative.

20:58.860 --> 21:02.920
And I don't know if that was about like that they wanted to buy a company to get other

21:02.920 --> 21:07.760
types of stories published about the company or no, literally they are buying the, the

21:07.760 --> 21:12.020
journalistic things to write different stories.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.980
That part is like, you know, kind of thing.

21:14.980 --> 21:15.980
Obviously it didn't happen.

21:15.980 --> 21:20.820
Let's focus on that versus actually making positive change.

21:20.820 --> 21:23.540
And again, look at who writes our textbooks.

21:23.540 --> 21:24.540
Yeah.

21:24.540 --> 21:27.540
Well, it's a, it's a common, common, common tactic.

21:27.540 --> 21:28.540
Yeah.

21:28.540 --> 21:31.120
It's, it's, uh, it's, so that's, that was interesting at all.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.740
But then, uh, they want their own revisionist history.

21:34.740 --> 21:38.380
Activision Blizzard went to other suitors because I think when they realized Microsoft

21:38.380 --> 21:41.420
made a deal, they wanted to see if somebody else will give them more money.

21:41.420 --> 21:46.060
And it's known that, um, Facebook meta is one of the other suitors they talked to.

21:46.060 --> 21:48.420
Thank, thank God that didn't happen.

21:48.420 --> 21:49.700
Can we all take a look?

21:50.700 --> 21:55.940
I don't care if you're the biggest, I don't care if you're the biggest Sony fanboy and

21:55.940 --> 22:00.460
you hate everything that Microsoft does and says and breeze, which I think, I think is

22:00.460 --> 22:01.460
silly in the first place.

22:01.460 --> 22:05.180
And I would say the exact same thing about vice versa, um, because I, I definitely know

22:05.180 --> 22:09.540
those people that are vice versa and it's, it's, it's ridiculous.

22:09.540 --> 22:15.780
But uh, here's the thing, as much as you can hate Microsoft with every fiber of your being,

22:15.780 --> 22:18.940
it still could have been worse.

22:18.940 --> 22:21.620
Like can you imagine if meta had bought Activision?

22:21.620 --> 22:25.980
Like I would have, I don't know what I would have done.

22:25.980 --> 22:27.580
I would have, I would have been so upset.

22:27.580 --> 22:31.740
I think, I think, I think tonight would have been a night of mourning, uh, for sure.

22:31.740 --> 22:35.140
Uh, and we don't know who the third suitor was.

22:35.140 --> 22:45.740
I would speculate a Google Stadia question mark or, or an Amazon.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.860
I would, well, that doesn't mean, but that doesn't mean Activision didn't try to start

22:48.860 --> 22:49.860
conversation.

22:49.860 --> 22:54.820
I would speculate a Google or an Amazon where that was the other suitor, but I, at the end

22:54.820 --> 22:55.820
of the day, I don't know.

22:55.820 --> 22:57.300
So, and neither do you.

22:57.300 --> 23:01.820
So um, Bobby Black will suggest Tencent.

23:01.820 --> 23:04.760
Well, didn't Tencent get that stake in Ubisoft?

23:04.760 --> 23:07.220
So I kind of feel like Tencent is making moves other places.

23:07.220 --> 23:12.540
I mean, maybe, uh, yeah, but I, I Google and Amazon are the two I'm, I'm thinking of.

23:12.540 --> 23:18.100
So so what do you all think of this at the end of the day?

23:18.100 --> 23:24.220
What do you, do you, do you, cause I, I, I do see the arguments that gaming is becoming

23:24.220 --> 23:25.300
too big.

23:25.300 --> 23:31.020
It's becoming these gigantic monolith companies and so forth, but I'm also of the mindset

23:31.020 --> 23:36.780
that particularly when it comes to Activision Blizzard, something had to change.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.740
The dam was going to burst.

23:39.740 --> 23:45.060
That company was literally being run into the ground by horrible mismanagement and people

23:45.060 --> 23:48.020
were abandoning ship left and right.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.940
Something had to happen.

23:49.940 --> 23:55.100
And I, you know, even though I, I definitely hear and I understand the whole like gaming

23:55.100 --> 24:01.640
monolith thing, I, Bobby Kotick is to blame and set that company up for this to happen.

24:01.640 --> 24:06.800
I don't see how else I, it was that or they, they go bankrupt.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.580
Like they, they, they're getting bought out one way or another.

24:10.580 --> 24:15.580
Any thoughts from y'all on your thoughts on this whole purchase?

24:15.580 --> 24:17.380
I don't care how much Kotick gets paid.

24:17.380 --> 24:23.620
I want him gone to not have to hear about him again would make me happy.

24:23.620 --> 24:26.540
I can't stand how he's trying to change the narrative either.

24:26.540 --> 24:30.400
Like he was interviewed for something and he was like, well, why do you think the stock

24:30.400 --> 24:31.400
has gone down?

24:31.400 --> 24:37.020
And you know, of course, instead of talking about him because of him, well, which I logically

24:37.020 --> 24:39.980
know nobody's going to say, oh, it's my fault.

24:39.980 --> 24:45.860
Um, although, although don't we remember about three months ago when Final Fantasy

24:45.860 --> 24:52.280
14 and Walker was having issues and Yoshi P got up there and said, I apologize.

24:52.280 --> 24:57.100
Wasn't that the most refreshing fucking thing to ever happen in the gaming industry?

24:57.100 --> 24:59.100
I apologize.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.100
Yes.

25:00.100 --> 25:01.500
You gotta taking a pay cut.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.460
I'm sorry.

25:04.700 --> 25:07.540
What a refreshing fucking perspective.

25:07.540 --> 25:13.700
But Bobby Kotick, no, no, no says, well, with Diablo 4 getting delayed and Overwatch 2 getting

25:13.700 --> 25:21.820
delayed and Call of Duty not being up to expectation, whose fucking fault is that, dummy?

25:21.820 --> 25:24.780
And I'm glad he's getting called the fuck out for it.

25:24.780 --> 25:28.820
That Overwatch producer, I don't know if it was current or former on Twitter that basically

25:28.820 --> 25:32.540
called him the fuck out and was like, what?

25:32.540 --> 25:37.060
Overwatch 2 is, is getting put off because you've been putting us on crunch projects

25:37.060 --> 25:39.060
that have gone nowhere.

25:39.060 --> 25:40.260
Call him out.

25:40.260 --> 25:44.820
And I, at least I will say this and dark soccer, I, I would think you would agree, but let

25:44.820 --> 25:45.820
me know.

25:45.820 --> 25:50.900
Thank God the media is calling him out on that bullshit and not letting him dictate

25:50.900 --> 25:53.540
the narrative.

25:53.540 --> 25:55.380
They have to, they have to combat it.

25:55.380 --> 25:58.140
I mean, like, no, you're, you're wrong.

25:58.140 --> 26:01.180
It's totally your fault and we're going to hold, you know, we're going to nail your ass

26:01.180 --> 26:02.180
on it.

26:02.180 --> 26:03.180
Yeah.

26:03.180 --> 26:04.420
So he, not even in a good way.

26:04.420 --> 26:09.620
He may get a $200 million payout, but you know what he won't get is his dignity and

26:09.620 --> 26:10.620
his reputation.

26:10.620 --> 26:11.620
Shit.

26:11.620 --> 26:15.980
I wish that the day he, you know what, y'all, y'all, y'all, here we go.

26:15.980 --> 26:16.980
Here we go.

26:16.980 --> 26:18.900
This is how I want to open OLR.

26:18.900 --> 26:19.900
The week Bobby.

26:19.900 --> 26:20.900
Okay.

26:20.900 --> 26:21.900
Y'all with me?

26:21.900 --> 26:22.900
Y'all with me?

26:22.900 --> 26:25.980
Cause it's going to require costumes and props, costumes and props.

26:26.020 --> 26:29.020
The week Bobby Kotick is gone.

26:29.020 --> 26:34.300
I want us to start the show and I want us all to have our bells and I want us to go

26:34.300 --> 26:43.340
shame, shame, shame with our bells while Bobby Kotick leaves this industry forever.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.300
And we shame him into the night.

26:45.300 --> 26:48.540
Sound good?

26:48.540 --> 26:51.140
I mean, I have better things I could cosplay.

26:51.140 --> 26:54.820
Honestly, Rob, it's not worth it.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.220
I don't care about him.

26:56.220 --> 26:59.500
I just don't want to acknowledge his existence anymore.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.140
He's going to be crying into his $320 million.

27:01.140 --> 27:05.620
I don't want to give him any attention.

27:05.620 --> 27:12.540
I want him to fade out into obscurity as a stinky shit stain on video game history.

27:12.540 --> 27:17.820
But there, there, there isn't a little part of you that wants to be there and start yelling

27:17.820 --> 27:23.060
muck, scum, rabbit droppings.

27:23.060 --> 27:25.580
There isn't a little part of you.

27:25.580 --> 27:33.020
I don't want to give a piece of shit like that.

27:33.020 --> 27:35.740
Any energy is not worth my energy.

27:35.740 --> 27:36.740
I get it.

27:36.740 --> 27:37.740
I get it.

27:37.740 --> 27:38.740
All right, Loki.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.740
What about?

27:39.740 --> 27:40.740
Oh, sorry.

27:40.740 --> 27:45.740
I can take that energy and put it into combating people like him.

27:45.740 --> 27:46.740
Fair enough.

27:46.740 --> 27:50.180
So maybe your final thought on this whole Activision Blizzard thing, and is this a good

27:50.180 --> 27:51.180
thing or not?

27:51.180 --> 27:55.540
Yeah, I think it's a good thing because they, I mean, maybe at least they'll, you know,

27:55.540 --> 27:59.340
up the quality of certain titles that they put out.

27:59.340 --> 28:05.420
It's been just a mess with like Call of Duty and stuff, but I don't know, we'll see.

28:05.420 --> 28:07.540
All right, let's move on.

28:07.540 --> 28:10.800
I'm sure this is going to be a developing story and we're going to hear a lot about

28:10.800 --> 28:16.140
this over the next year as, you know, it starts to get looked at under a magnifying glass.

28:16.140 --> 28:20.940
I will give a quick plug because I talked at length with Bobby for like an hour or 15

28:20.940 --> 28:24.340
minutes earlier this week, and that video, it's up on YouTube.

28:24.340 --> 28:28.940
So if you're a subscriber here at Twitch TV, you can see it in the Twitch archives, but

28:28.940 --> 28:32.380
we decided, you know what, let's put this one up on YouTube on the house so you can

28:32.380 --> 28:36.460
see that on our YouTube as well over at Channel VOG Network.

28:36.460 --> 28:40.940
We don't use our YouTube for a lot, so I'm going to point you in that direction to check

28:40.940 --> 28:41.940
that one out.

28:41.940 --> 28:42.940
So there you go.

28:42.940 --> 28:43.940
All right.

28:43.940 --> 28:48.260
Odigerama S says, open the show with celebration by cooling the game.

28:48.260 --> 28:53.420
That's a DMCA violation and cost more money than he's worth.

28:53.420 --> 28:59.580
In theory, I'm with your brother, but in execution, we can't.

28:59.580 --> 29:02.380
All right, let's move on.

29:02.380 --> 29:07.360
Let's shift the conversation away from idiot CEOs to more important people, us, and talk

29:07.360 --> 29:11.000
about our gaming weeks and the types of games we have been playing this week.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.260
So let me go to Dark Sakura.

29:12.260 --> 29:13.260
How was your gaming week?

29:13.700 --> 29:14.700
You want to guess?

29:14.700 --> 29:21.580
I'm going to say Dead by Daylight, Fantasian, Word Scramble.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.940
Have you gotten on the Wordle train yet?

29:24.940 --> 29:27.020
No, and I'm not going to.

29:27.020 --> 29:29.300
It's fine.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.580
It's inoffensive.

29:31.580 --> 29:32.780
I like Wordle.

29:32.780 --> 29:37.500
I like that it's one a day and I don't like everyone freaking posting their little weird

29:37.500 --> 29:40.500
square things that make zero sense to anybody else.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
Yeah, it does.

29:41.500 --> 29:46.140
It does seem a little bit cultish and I'm guilty of posting it, but I think that's kind

29:46.140 --> 29:49.860
of the brilliance of it in a weird way.

29:49.860 --> 29:56.940
I am perfectly happy with the games that I play.

29:56.940 --> 30:02.340
I actually did some screwing around, so I have a VHS key.

30:02.340 --> 30:04.940
Oh, yeah, that's right.

30:04.940 --> 30:10.300
I heard you were trying to get that working on your Mac, so you cracked the code and got

30:10.300 --> 30:11.940
a key to VHS, huh?

30:11.940 --> 30:22.540
To tell you how it happened, I happened to give somebody a sub in a mutual friend's chat.

30:22.540 --> 30:25.580
I'm trying not to get anybody in trouble.

30:25.580 --> 30:31.500
And that mutual friend had met through playing VHS.

30:31.500 --> 30:37.060
And I was like, yeah, I've messaged the VHS devs to see if they have any information about

30:37.060 --> 30:38.860
this running in Parallels and everything.

30:38.860 --> 30:40.940
And the person messages me is like, do you want to code?

30:40.940 --> 30:43.220
I'm like, yes, I want to code.

30:43.220 --> 30:45.180
So I have a code.

30:45.180 --> 30:49.340
And we should say we should say because not everybody's just going to know VHS.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.300
We're not talking about the old 80s videotape.

30:51.300 --> 30:56.260
We're talking about a game, which that's the vibe that another asymmetrical game, but it's

30:56.260 --> 30:59.020
a bit different than it's a bit different than it by the way.

30:59.020 --> 31:00.020
Yeah.

31:00.020 --> 31:06.020
Not not gore and horror, but more cheesy play as teenagers trapped in 80s VHS, you know,

31:06.020 --> 31:11.780
direct-to-video slasher flicks, but like gremlins slasher flicks, like not actually gory.

31:11.780 --> 31:12.780
Yeah.

31:12.780 --> 31:15.460
And you have to kill the monster or before the monster kills you.

31:15.460 --> 31:24.380
So so anyway, I I got the game to run.

31:24.380 --> 31:29.960
Now the problem being is that every time I go into the tutorial so that I can practice

31:29.960 --> 31:35.740
playing the game, I have the eternal loading screen and the loading screen has full animation.

31:35.740 --> 31:39.740
You know, I wonder what would happen if I just left it to run overnight so the game

31:39.740 --> 31:45.260
will run and I don't really have too many problems getting it to that point until I

31:45.260 --> 31:46.800
try to get into the tutorial.

31:46.800 --> 31:53.580
It will even cue me for a match, but I can't I haven't let it stay in queue.

31:53.580 --> 31:57.260
I don't want to start playing the game and then have it not work on me while I'm in a

31:57.260 --> 32:01.140
match and then screw everybody else over.

32:01.140 --> 32:06.140
So I am letting another friend use my account.

32:06.140 --> 32:11.780
Another streamer friend who has, you know, said is hiding, hiding my username, hiding

32:11.780 --> 32:12.780
everything.

32:12.780 --> 32:17.220
No one's going to get in trouble, special password and everything, but at least someone

32:17.220 --> 32:22.220
gets to enjoy the game for a little bit that wouldn't have otherwise enjoyed it.

32:22.220 --> 32:28.420
So but I can tell you right now when I think the virtualization for Windows 11 ARM gets

32:28.420 --> 32:32.540
better, I think VHS is going to have no problem running.

32:32.540 --> 32:35.340
So keep giving the feedback to the devs.

32:35.340 --> 32:37.140
That's what betas are for.

32:37.140 --> 32:39.420
You know, that's what I'm doing.

32:39.420 --> 32:44.980
That being said, since I had to reinstall my virtual, I basically had to recreate my

32:44.980 --> 32:48.180
virtual machine and reinstall Windows 11.

32:48.180 --> 32:53.900
I'm now going to see if I can get Mass Effect to work because it's running a lot better

32:53.900 --> 32:55.540
than it was.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.380
So I've reinstalled Mass Effect.

32:57.380 --> 33:01.500
I haven't started running it or anything.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.700
I did also make another discovery because now I've just sort of been playing around

33:04.700 --> 33:09.860
with different things behind the scenes is that Dead by Daylight will run on Windows

33:09.860 --> 33:10.860
ARM.

33:10.860 --> 33:15.500
What doesn't run is the anti-cheat.

33:15.500 --> 33:21.300
Easy anti-cheat won't run, which is funny because VHS uses that too.

33:21.300 --> 33:25.380
But I have no idea what the difference is, why the launcher and everything is working

33:25.380 --> 33:28.620
there but the one for Dead by Daylight isn't.

33:28.620 --> 33:33.140
The only thing is that when I load Dead by Daylight directly, in absence of the anti-cheat,

33:33.140 --> 33:39.180
then it doesn't think I'm online for Steam.

33:39.180 --> 33:47.700
That being said, I am now shopping around for a graphics card to try to get my old PC

33:47.700 --> 33:55.140
rebuilt, thankfully with some parts that a good friend was kind enough to gift me.

33:55.140 --> 33:56.140
Thank you.

33:56.140 --> 34:03.580
I just need a better graphics card for it and to give it another go.

34:03.580 --> 34:07.420
So we're gonna see.

34:07.420 --> 34:11.260
But yeah, I've been doing a lot more stuff with other games, not necessarily playing

34:11.260 --> 34:16.740
them, but working on getting them to work in the background.

34:16.740 --> 34:21.380
I don't know if I have anything that would be helpful, but if you need PC parts, I'm

34:21.380 --> 34:24.540
gonna be dismantling the old show PC because it serves no purpose.

34:24.540 --> 34:26.660
It's not gonna have what I want.

34:26.660 --> 34:27.660
It's way too much.

34:27.660 --> 34:28.660
Thought I'd try.

34:28.660 --> 34:29.660
Thought I'd try.

34:29.660 --> 34:30.660
But thank you.

34:30.660 --> 34:31.660
Yeah.

34:31.660 --> 34:32.660
All right.

34:32.660 --> 34:33.660
Well, let's move on.

34:33.660 --> 34:35.300
Loki, how was your gaming week?

34:35.300 --> 34:39.580
It was all Minecraft, as usual.

34:39.580 --> 34:41.500
I did find something funny though.

34:41.500 --> 34:47.060
So I mean, it was bound to happen sooner or later, but there's been some let's plays

34:47.060 --> 34:53.100
being put up for Pixel Poops number two on YouTube, one of which I saw that he really

34:53.100 --> 34:57.700
hated it.

34:57.700 --> 34:59.500
But yeah, I had good points.

34:59.500 --> 35:04.380
But like, obviously, being the one that made it like, I understand why I couldn't do certain

35:04.380 --> 35:05.380
things they want.

35:05.380 --> 35:09.500
Also, like playing with a turbo controller uses too easy, like, yeah, because you're

35:09.500 --> 35:12.780
playing as a turbo controller, you idiot.

35:12.780 --> 35:14.580
But it's fine.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.900
Not everybody's gonna like it.

35:16.900 --> 35:17.900
Let me ask you this.

35:17.900 --> 35:22.620
We're celebrating 900 episodes tonight and a 20 year history of this show.

35:22.620 --> 35:28.180
And sometimes, Loki, I think you're viewed as the critical one, especially when it comes

35:28.180 --> 35:29.740
to things like Nintendo and so forth.

35:29.740 --> 35:34.260
We've talked at length about how a lot of that does come from a place of love, ultimately.

35:34.260 --> 35:38.940
But you're the first to be critical about a video game and its flaws and so forth.

35:38.940 --> 35:44.500
Now it sounds like the tables might be turned a little bit and you're kind of hearing and

35:44.500 --> 35:49.500
you know, in the back of your mind, well, what this reviewer is talking about are limitations

35:49.500 --> 35:50.500
of the hardware.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.540
I can't do the things they're asking for.

35:52.540 --> 35:57.100
Does it change your perspective at all in talking about games this way?

35:57.100 --> 35:58.860
It's more expectations too.

35:58.860 --> 36:02.980
Like they have like the game, the purpose of the game is supposed to be like a simple

36:02.980 --> 36:04.060
arcade game.

36:04.060 --> 36:07.940
So like, they're like, well, the game plays all the same through all the levels.

36:07.940 --> 36:13.620
I'm like, yeah, but haven't you played like Pac-Man or Mr. Do or like any of these like

36:13.620 --> 36:19.340
old 80s arcade games where, yeah, the gameplay is going to be the same across all the levels.

36:19.340 --> 36:21.640
It doesn't change throughout the thing.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.780
And so it's just the expectations that they have.

36:24.780 --> 36:28.580
Some of the things they had good points like, like, why isn't there an enemy, like, say

36:28.580 --> 36:33.040
that jumps over one of the poops and then, you know, you have to put two in a row or

36:33.040 --> 36:34.040
something like that.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.500
And like, yes, I did consider stuff like that.

36:36.500 --> 36:40.300
The problem is because their behavior is very random.

36:40.300 --> 36:46.120
If you put that, if you have an enemy like that and they're near the end of the screen

36:46.120 --> 36:50.580
and you put down like something to try to trap them and they jump over off the screen,

36:50.580 --> 36:52.740
it seems unfair to the player.

36:52.740 --> 36:57.260
And so there's like a lot of things I couldn't do because it would be, it would seem unfair

36:57.260 --> 37:01.420
because there'd be no way to combat it because it's just the enemy behavior.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.340
But like it, yeah, I understand that.

37:03.340 --> 37:06.980
But also at the same time, they're like, well, I didn't like it cause it's too easy.

37:06.980 --> 37:10.520
And like, yeah, you see him play at the turbo controller and then you just like build the

37:10.520 --> 37:12.980
entire screens like, okay, and I got nothing to do.

37:12.980 --> 37:18.680
But normally if you play with a turbo controller, it's very frantic and it's that.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.620
So he's missing something with that.

37:20.620 --> 37:21.620
It's fine.

37:21.620 --> 37:22.620
Like whatever, you know,

37:22.620 --> 37:25.420
I'm glad you have a measured approach to the feedback of nothing else.

37:25.420 --> 37:28.940
Like you're, I'm glad you have, cause honestly, Loki, I would normally tell you, and you know

37:28.940 --> 37:31.860
this, don't read the comments section.

37:31.860 --> 37:33.460
Don't watch these YouTube's nothing.

37:33.460 --> 37:37.460
It's only going to demotivate you, but at least it sounds like you kind of, you know,

37:37.460 --> 37:40.340
you're, you're approaching this with the whole, like, okay, it is what it is.

37:40.340 --> 37:44.060
And like, there's some things that is not going to please this guy, but he had a point

37:44.060 --> 37:45.260
here or there.

37:45.260 --> 37:47.900
And I'll think about that, you know, with future games.

37:47.900 --> 37:53.460
Like I, and I get it, like if the hardware stuff or even maybe necessarily my coding

37:53.460 --> 38:00.000
skills or whatever were, you know, there's probably ways you can cram more stuff in there,

38:00.000 --> 38:01.540
but like I just couldn't.

38:01.540 --> 38:05.340
I just, I just didn't want, I don't want these YouTube's and I don't think they are,

38:05.340 --> 38:06.340
but I need to say it.

38:06.340 --> 38:09.140
I don't want these YouTube's to discourage you from doing another.

38:09.140 --> 38:15.700
Oh no, no, no, no, no, it's, it's, it's just like, no, it's only one person that doesn't

38:15.700 --> 38:16.700
like it.

38:16.700 --> 38:19.300
And it's well, I don't like it either.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.300
No, I'm just kidding.

38:20.300 --> 38:21.300
I think it's fine.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.300
You know, I love it.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.580
To be fair and say, it's not like somebody, like they didn't give it a good shot.

38:25.580 --> 38:29.140
Like he played like two hours worth of the game and I get it.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.140
Yeah.

38:30.740 --> 38:35.820
Especially if you're playing with, like I said, turbo controller, um, because he says

38:35.820 --> 38:37.280
his controller is breaking.

38:37.280 --> 38:40.340
So that's why he had to play with the turbo or something like that.

38:40.340 --> 38:41.820
Turn the turbo off.

38:41.820 --> 38:42.820
Exactly.

38:42.820 --> 38:47.260
Well, I think he, I think he had like a controller that has like, you know, turbo way and then

38:47.260 --> 38:52.620
regular a, and so his a button was broken, so he had to play through whatever, but like,

38:52.620 --> 38:57.140
so some of that is his fault, but some of that is, yeah, it's just the way the game

38:57.140 --> 38:58.140
is.

38:58.140 --> 38:59.140
Yeah.

38:59.140 --> 39:00.140
I get it.

39:00.140 --> 39:02.940
Like some of the complaints were valid criticisms.

39:02.940 --> 39:04.860
Well, did he say anything good?

39:04.860 --> 39:08.860
Like the music's good or it's no, he got tired of the music too, because he's all, it's

39:08.860 --> 39:10.700
the same songs over and over again.

39:10.700 --> 39:15.940
It's like, yeah, I only have limited space to put audio, but like, it's fine.

39:15.940 --> 39:18.620
So whatever, you're not going to please everybody.

39:18.620 --> 39:19.620
It's fine.

39:19.620 --> 39:20.620
That's true.

39:20.620 --> 39:21.620
He bought the game.

39:21.620 --> 39:22.620
He played it for a couple of hours.

39:22.620 --> 39:25.180
I was going to say at the end of the day, did you give him a code?

39:25.180 --> 39:26.180
Nope.

39:26.180 --> 39:27.180
Then he bought it and you got his money.

39:27.220 --> 39:28.220
Bought a copy of the game.

39:28.220 --> 39:29.220
So that's fine.

39:29.220 --> 39:30.220
Yeah.

39:30.220 --> 39:31.220
It's completely fine.

39:31.220 --> 39:32.220
You know what?

39:32.220 --> 39:33.220
You know, you can't please everybody.

39:33.220 --> 39:34.220
That's right.

39:34.220 --> 39:35.220
Perfectly fine.

39:35.220 --> 39:38.220
It kind of, it's funny to me because it almost sounds like the reverse is happening where

39:38.220 --> 39:42.900
it's like you get his perspective as the cynical gamer.

39:42.900 --> 39:47.020
You're like, whatever I get it from his, it's kind of funny.

39:47.020 --> 39:48.020
All right.

39:48.020 --> 39:51.340
Um, my gaming week, uh, pretty much a lot of the same old stuff.

39:51.340 --> 39:52.340
Final Fantasy 14.

39:52.340 --> 39:54.380
I got my bard to level 90.

39:54.380 --> 39:55.900
So another max level character.

39:55.900 --> 40:00.220
Uh, I've also been playing, um, dead by daylight here and there.

40:00.220 --> 40:01.860
Uh, I die damage.

40:01.860 --> 40:04.620
I got my Cheryl to prestige three.

40:04.620 --> 40:08.500
So that's the first character that I've actually gone through the blood web the most number

40:08.500 --> 40:10.540
of times you can and prestige three.

40:10.540 --> 40:12.180
So that was, I guess, the achievement.

40:12.180 --> 40:13.180
Yeah.

40:13.180 --> 40:15.980
So I have my, I'm actually close to getting my Freddie to prestige too.

40:15.980 --> 40:16.980
Oh, cool.

40:16.980 --> 40:17.980
Cool.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.220
I haven't even prestige one, any killer.

40:20.220 --> 40:23.340
So by the way, before I forget, I did get pig adept.

40:23.340 --> 40:24.900
Oh, congrats.

40:24.900 --> 40:25.900
That's a hard one to get.

40:25.900 --> 40:29.100
Uh, it was, but I was on my game that night.

40:29.100 --> 40:32.500
I didn't mean to interrupt, but I had to say, no, I was going to say, and I know the tone

40:32.500 --> 40:37.060
that starts on Tuesday, I think is all about saw and pig pig and tap.

40:37.060 --> 40:39.120
So maybe you'll get some cosmetics out of that.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.120
So did you see though?

40:40.120 --> 40:41.120
The preview picture?

40:41.120 --> 40:42.120
Yeah, I did.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.120
I saw your, your tweet.

40:43.120 --> 40:46.980
It was like, please let this be a cosmetic and it is, it has to be a cosmetic.

40:46.980 --> 40:52.020
It has to, I've been checking schema's channel, the guy who does all of the leak renders and

40:52.020 --> 40:55.460
everything and I haven't seen anything on there yet.

40:55.460 --> 40:56.940
So I'm just crossing my fingers.

40:56.940 --> 41:01.500
We should be pretty close to, to the public test of the ring new chapter.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.620
That's pretty exciting too.

41:02.620 --> 41:03.620
So we'll see.

41:03.620 --> 41:04.620
All right.

41:04.620 --> 41:05.620
Anyway.

41:05.620 --> 41:08.260
Um, also one of the thing I want to mention on my gaming week though is, um, no man's

41:08.260 --> 41:13.240
sky, which I know I play a lot, but I did something very special in no man's sky because

41:13.240 --> 41:16.140
there's no, um, expedition going on now.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.300
The, the repeats all finished.

41:18.300 --> 41:21.620
So if you, you missed expedition one, two, three, four, sorry.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.220
They've come and gone again.

41:23.220 --> 41:25.060
And so you're not going to be able to do them.

41:25.060 --> 41:27.060
Uh, and right now there is no expedition.

41:27.060 --> 41:31.420
I am assuming expedition five is waiting in the wings for whatever the next patch ends

41:31.420 --> 41:33.040
up being for no man's sky.

41:33.040 --> 41:36.220
So in the interim, I was like, you know what, I should work on some achievements.

41:36.220 --> 41:39.700
And there's one staring me in the face is the hardest achievement in the entire game

41:39.700 --> 41:44.700
because it's get to the center of the galaxy, which is basically beating the game.

41:44.700 --> 41:50.640
Although spoiler alert, all it does, it starts you in a new galaxy.

41:50.640 --> 41:51.640
That's it.

41:51.640 --> 41:52.640
That's the end of the game.

41:52.640 --> 41:57.480
So, um, but it's, it's, you know, that's not, you know, the point is exploration and all

41:57.480 --> 41:58.480
that.

41:58.480 --> 42:03.300
So I don't, I don't judge it for that, but, um, I, you have to get to the center of the

42:03.300 --> 42:05.620
galaxy on permadeath.

42:05.620 --> 42:10.580
And not only is it permadeath, but permadeath is twice as hard as regular mode.

42:10.580 --> 42:13.060
Your life bars deplete twice as fast.

42:13.060 --> 42:18.420
You can only hold stacks of 250, not 999, like a normal mode.

42:18.420 --> 42:19.420
It is a lot harder.

42:19.420 --> 42:23.480
And I will tell you, when I first started permadeath mode, I died in five minutes on

42:23.480 --> 42:24.600
the first planet.

42:24.600 --> 42:28.940
But I will also tell you this, the hardest part of permadeath mode is getting off the

42:28.940 --> 42:33.520
first planet, because right as soon as your game starts, the clock's ticking and you've

42:33.520 --> 42:39.280
got to be able to find sodium and oxygen fast, and you have to know, or a cave opening.

42:39.280 --> 42:42.060
And some planets are just not going to be as friendly as others.

42:42.060 --> 42:46.360
So my first planet, I died in less than five minutes.

42:46.360 --> 42:51.340
Second one, I got that inertia going where I got to my ship, was able to fix the ship.

42:51.340 --> 42:52.340
Okay.

42:52.340 --> 42:57.140
I can make stacks and stacks of life support gels and ion batteries.

42:57.140 --> 42:58.940
And I was good after that.

42:58.940 --> 42:59.940
And guess what?

42:59.940 --> 43:03.500
I got the achievement for getting to the center of the galaxy in permadeath.

43:03.500 --> 43:09.540
I did cheese it a little bit, um, because I just kept going to the space anomaly, the

43:09.540 --> 43:15.140
multiplayer hub over and over until I saw a base that said, uh, center of the galaxy.

43:15.140 --> 43:19.420
And I finally found one that said end of galaxy one green system.

43:19.420 --> 43:24.680
And I went to it and sure enough, a good Judy had built a base and a green system at the

43:24.680 --> 43:26.000
edge of the galaxy.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.120
And I was one jump away from the center of the galaxy.

43:28.120 --> 43:30.120
So I did cheese it a little bit.

43:30.120 --> 43:35.720
However, I still think to get to that point, I mean, you still have to go through a big

43:35.720 --> 43:36.960
chunk of the story.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.360
You have to get the space anomaly.

43:38.360 --> 43:42.560
You have to build your first warp cell, and you're doing all this in permadeath mode with

43:42.560 --> 43:47.040
limited stacks where you can't just stack carbon and ferrite dust to your heart's content.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.200
So it was challenging.

43:49.200 --> 43:52.020
And so I'm still going to pat myself on the back a little bit.

43:52.020 --> 43:57.500
And according to the Xbox statistics, only 0.11% of players have unlocked that achievement.

43:57.500 --> 44:00.040
So one in a thousand have gotten that achievement.

44:00.040 --> 44:04.420
So I've officially reached galaxy brain level of no man's sky.

44:04.420 --> 44:05.420
And it feels great.

44:05.420 --> 44:08.860
Now I just need to go clean up a couple other non permadeath achievements that are just

44:08.860 --> 44:09.860
grinds.

44:09.860 --> 44:10.860
And that's what I'll do next.

44:10.860 --> 44:14.220
I will have my full thousand out of a thousand.

44:14.220 --> 44:20.560
So Bobby Black Wolf, it is possible to end your achievement score in zero.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.760
Just so you know, you just you have to get them all.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.760
And that's what I intend to do.

44:26.760 --> 44:32.960
So but yeah, you all know I love that game and what it's become over the last five years.

44:32.960 --> 44:34.940
So that was a very meaningful achievement to get.

44:34.940 --> 44:39.320
And I'm sure I will get really verklempt when I get that Xbox equivalent of platinum.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.060
There are no platinum trophies on Xbox.

44:41.060 --> 44:43.600
You just have the thousand out of a thousand.

44:43.600 --> 44:46.060
So yeah, I feel good.

44:46.060 --> 44:47.400
All right.

44:47.400 --> 44:48.440
That's it for my gaming week.

44:48.440 --> 44:51.620
I think we can get into some more news.

44:51.620 --> 44:58.480
I will just mention we will not be here February 20th for reasons I already mentioned.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.980
But we will still be here over the next few weeks.

45:00.980 --> 45:03.540
So let's try to get into some more gaming news tonight.

45:03.540 --> 45:06.060
Loki, why don't you start us off?

45:06.060 --> 45:11.760
Yeah, so probably one of the first things that everyone was wondering once Microsoft

45:11.760 --> 45:16.140
talked about purchasing Activision Blizzard is, hey, are we going to see some of these

45:16.140 --> 45:18.560
older franchises come back?

45:18.560 --> 45:22.240
You know, we're going to take some of these studios off of making Call of Duty games every

45:22.240 --> 45:23.960
year.

45:23.960 --> 45:26.440
And I think it's still a bit early for all that.

45:26.440 --> 45:30.700
But Phil Spencer was saying that we're hoping to be able to work with them when the deal

45:30.700 --> 45:34.860
closes to make sure we have some resources to work on franchises that I love from my

45:34.860 --> 45:38.120
childhood and the teams really want to get.

45:38.120 --> 45:42.360
I'm looking forward to these conversations to really think about adding resources, increasing

45:42.360 --> 45:43.360
capabilities.

45:43.360 --> 45:48.680
So it's not off the table, but nothing definitive yet because they haven't purchased the company

45:48.680 --> 45:49.680
yet.

45:49.680 --> 45:50.680
So let that happen first.

45:50.680 --> 45:58.360
And we'll talk about bringing back Guitar Hero or whatnot, but might be cool.

45:58.360 --> 46:03.280
Some of the franchises he had talked about, apparently, from this Washington Post article

46:03.280 --> 46:08.220
was King's Quest, Guitar Hero and Hexen.

46:08.220 --> 46:10.300
Those are and that's that's a dream list.

46:10.300 --> 46:11.300
Yeah, fuck yeah, Hexen.

46:11.300 --> 46:18.020
I think that's like at the top of my list of what I want to see come back for sure.

46:18.020 --> 46:22.420
What's interesting, you know, and Bobby, you know, because we tape live here at VOG Network,

46:22.420 --> 46:25.980
and so I'm usually sitting here as I think a lot of us are listening to Bobby and watching

46:25.980 --> 46:27.740
the chat engage with his show.

46:27.740 --> 46:31.260
And obviously, this is the big headline on his show tonight, too.

46:31.260 --> 46:32.260
And it was interesting.

46:32.260 --> 46:35.400
People in chat were piping up talking about what about a new river raid?

46:35.400 --> 46:36.720
What about a new pitfall?

46:36.720 --> 46:43.320
I have to be honest and respectfully, folks, I I do don't want that, like a new pitfall.

46:43.320 --> 46:49.080
Like how would a new pitfall not just be Uncharted or Tomb Raider?

46:49.080 --> 46:54.640
Like in my mind, a modern pitfall are those types of games that sure slap pitfall Harry

46:54.640 --> 46:59.960
on it and call it pitfall, but it's just going to then it's going to feel reductive to that.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.720
And what is there now?

47:01.720 --> 47:03.660
Where I would be cool with it.

47:03.660 --> 47:07.860
And I would love to see this get explored.

47:07.860 --> 47:12.940
I just worry about Microsoft's commitment to retro after Game Room.

47:12.940 --> 47:18.020
However, I do remember when the Xbox 360 arcade first came out.

47:18.020 --> 47:25.380
We got a lot of pretty cool redos and reskins of older games, but like with Xbox Live features

47:25.380 --> 47:27.580
like multiplayer and things like that.

47:27.580 --> 47:33.640
I would love a pitfall that still keeps its retro roots in mind.

47:33.640 --> 47:37.200
Maybe something that's like a pitfall, pitfall three.

47:37.200 --> 47:41.840
I would, I would be all about a pitfall three that is still like a side scrolling adventure,

47:41.840 --> 47:43.280
like a little game.

47:43.280 --> 47:49.200
Why not let something like pitfall go to a small team of like three or four people and

47:49.200 --> 47:54.720
see what they come up with as like a small little, you know, cute little project that

47:54.720 --> 47:55.720
I would support.

47:55.720 --> 47:56.720
And same thing with like river raid.

47:56.920 --> 48:00.220
Like if a river raid game were to come out, it wouldn't even fucking look like the game

48:00.220 --> 48:06.180
you remember unless maybe it was something that was geared towards a small or an indie

48:06.180 --> 48:07.180
type of thing.

48:07.180 --> 48:10.740
And if that's the direction Microsoft goes, then I feel much differently.

48:10.740 --> 48:16.280
And I think that can actually be really awesome to see like a pitfall that keeps retro stuff

48:16.280 --> 48:19.540
in mind and is kind of uniquely pitfall in that regards.

48:19.540 --> 48:20.540
Yeah.

48:20.540 --> 48:21.540
Now you're talking chat.

48:21.540 --> 48:22.540
Change, right?

48:22.540 --> 48:25.600
Says pitfall championship edition, like Pac-Man.

48:25.600 --> 48:29.120
Maybe not literally, but you're on the right track.

48:29.120 --> 48:31.720
That was a great evolution of Pac-Man.

48:31.720 --> 48:35.960
Championship edition is a fantastic evolution of a retro concept.

48:35.960 --> 48:39.440
And so you're, yeah, you're, you're going down the right trail there for sure.

48:39.440 --> 48:42.360
Pitfall 99.

48:42.360 --> 48:43.980
I don't hate it.

48:43.980 --> 48:47.340
I don't hate it.

48:47.340 --> 48:49.900
Tiger claw says, how about mega mania?

48:49.900 --> 48:56.000
You know, I read that at first as a mega man universe for some reason and what that game

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
could have been.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.780
And I think that's a game a lot of us are sad never ended up happening.

48:59.780 --> 49:00.780
That's for sure.

49:00.780 --> 49:06.760
Um, so yeah, dark Tetsuya says, I wouldn't mind a modern rerelease of the 2,600 stuff.

49:06.760 --> 49:07.760
Me neither.

49:07.760 --> 49:11.440
And I think as long as they can still be a little bit cheeky about the fact that, you

49:11.440 --> 49:17.000
know, this, these are Atari 2,600 games and kind of like Loki brought up with his, uh,

49:17.000 --> 49:23.080
YouTube criticism of his game that didn't understand that it's a retro inspired game.

49:23.080 --> 49:24.080
Yes.

49:24.080 --> 49:26.920
It is kind of the same game loop over and over type of thing.

49:26.920 --> 49:30.760
As long as it doesn't like try to break some of those things that made those old games

49:30.760 --> 49:31.760
work.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.760
I think it could be fine.

49:32.760 --> 49:35.240
And by the way, how has nobody mentioned Keystone capers yet?

49:35.240 --> 49:36.280
Thank you very much.

49:36.280 --> 49:43.560
So that's the Activision franchise I'd like to see, but yes, hexen, um, and guitar hero.

49:43.560 --> 49:44.560
I think it would be great.

49:44.560 --> 49:48.000
Like hexen done, like the new doom games that'd be amazing.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.240
Oh my God.

49:49.240 --> 49:50.240
Yes.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.840
I think, I think really that's at the top.

49:51.840 --> 49:57.080
I mean, you know, I love me some retro, but I think a new hexen in the style of new doom

49:57.080 --> 49:58.320
is like at the top of my list.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.520
I would love to see that.

49:59.520 --> 50:00.520
I really would.

50:00.520 --> 50:05.200
Um, and as a music game lover, of course, I'd love to see guitar hero come back.

50:05.200 --> 50:10.720
And I think it's, we've, we've reached this really interesting place where now that everybody's

50:10.720 --> 50:15.320
gotten, not everybody, but a lot of people have gotten rid of their plastic guitars and

50:15.320 --> 50:18.400
plastic instruments and that whole thing, and they've unloaded regards.

50:18.400 --> 50:21.840
Now people want them again and nobody makes them.

50:21.840 --> 50:26.800
Um, and they're harder to get and maybe that's, and I think it was even kind of cited that

50:26.800 --> 50:31.920
Activision was hoping maybe Microsoft would have the means to bring the peripherals for

50:31.920 --> 50:37.320
those types of games back and maybe make a modern type of guitar hero, which obviously

50:37.320 --> 50:38.320
I'm all about that.

50:38.320 --> 50:43.520
I would, um, I would really love that Microsoft doesn't shy away from very large controllers.

50:43.520 --> 50:44.520
So why not?

50:44.520 --> 50:50.200
Um, SSG100 Matt says, I mean that tiny Tina's wonderlands game is going to scratch that

50:50.200 --> 50:51.200
hex and itch.

50:51.200 --> 50:52.200
Yeah.

50:52.200 --> 50:53.960
It's part of why that game looks appealing, honestly.

50:53.960 --> 50:54.960
So, um, yeah.

50:54.960 --> 51:01.000
So yeah, I, I, I, I'm all about old franchises coming back, but I think we also need to be

51:01.000 --> 51:03.540
a little bit measured about it.

51:03.540 --> 51:05.560
They're not going to come back for some time.

51:06.120 --> 51:08.380
Uh, this deal hasn't even closed yet.

51:08.380 --> 51:14.760
It's going to be a while, a while, uh, and maybe, uh, in fact, we might even be talking

51:14.760 --> 51:21.400
about Xbox series Y or Z or whatever the hell they come up with next that these sorts of

51:21.400 --> 51:23.140
things start happening for.

51:23.140 --> 51:29.120
So just, uh, it's going to be a little while, but me, I don't know at the same time, Blizzard

51:29.120 --> 51:35.960
making a King's quest game, I I'm kind of into it.

51:35.960 --> 51:36.960
Let's see.

51:36.960 --> 51:37.960
Let's see.

51:37.960 --> 51:38.960
Let's see what they got.

51:38.960 --> 51:42.200
You know, somebody might have to research this for me.

51:42.200 --> 51:44.080
I'm sorry.

51:44.080 --> 51:51.940
Doesn't didn't Sierra come back as an indie brand for Activision because there was a geometry

51:51.940 --> 51:53.400
Wars three.

51:53.400 --> 51:54.560
Remember?

51:54.560 --> 52:00.400
It was a few years ago and it was Sierra online that put it out, but it was like a rebranded

52:00.400 --> 52:04.060
Sierra because obviously they did not do the King's quest.

52:04.060 --> 52:07.520
Somebody else kind of got the rights to make that game.

52:07.520 --> 52:08.520
Okay.

52:08.520 --> 52:09.520
Okay.

52:09.520 --> 52:10.520
So that is right.

52:10.520 --> 52:11.520
Sierra entertainment is an indie brand for active.

52:11.520 --> 52:13.040
Oh, they did make the new King's quest.

52:13.040 --> 52:14.580
No, I thought that was another studio.

52:14.580 --> 52:15.580
Maybe they published it.

52:15.580 --> 52:19.880
Probably another studio made it and they published it, but yeah, they did the cause I know geometry

52:19.880 --> 52:22.180
Wars three was like one of their first games.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.420
Now that is like the label.

52:24.420 --> 52:29.780
I would like, I would like to see a pitfall or a Keystone capers and all that shit we

52:29.780 --> 52:34.340
were talking about earlier with that type of approach in mind, like they did geometry

52:34.340 --> 52:35.340
Wars three.

52:35.340 --> 52:39.420
I just don't know how well geometry Wars three sold if there's that incentive to do it, but

52:39.420 --> 52:44.300
I'm hoping Phil Spencer, uh, will, will have a different approach to it.

52:44.300 --> 52:45.300
I really do.

52:45.300 --> 52:47.300
So, all right.

52:47.300 --> 52:49.420
Meanwhile, let's talk about Sony.

52:49.420 --> 52:52.760
We've been very quiet on the Sony front, but we should talk about what's going on at the

52:52.760 --> 52:53.760
house of Sony.

52:53.760 --> 52:57.980
And, um, you know, we haven't talked a lot about what this whole Microsoft maneuver might

52:57.980 --> 52:59.500
mean for them.

52:59.500 --> 53:04.340
And I think in a big way, it really lights a fire under their ass to compete with game

53:04.340 --> 53:08.800
pass because I think Phil Spencer is absolutely playing the long game.

53:08.800 --> 53:10.740
And I think it's a game about game pass.

53:10.740 --> 53:14.420
Um, and PlayStation so far doesn't really have a response to that.

53:14.420 --> 53:17.060
Although definitely it seems like the clouds have been brewing, right?

53:17.060 --> 53:21.500
We talked about the PlayStation now cards and some of that, that all changed.

53:21.500 --> 53:27.900
Well, guess what else happened this last week, a small selection of PlayStation three games

53:27.900 --> 53:34.740
priced even showed up on the PlayStation five store, uh, titles in the dead or alive and

53:34.740 --> 53:39.440
Prince of Persia, Persia franchises, uh, were showing up.

53:39.440 --> 53:44.100
Those games are on PlayStation now, but they shouldn't have been separate titles available

53:44.100 --> 53:54.280
on PlayStation five, unless maybe, I mean, we have cloud games on switch, maybe Sony's

53:54.280 --> 53:59.080
either plotting cloud games or they have found a way to do backwards compatibility.

53:59.080 --> 54:02.360
There was a, there was rumblings of a new Mark Cerny patent.

54:02.360 --> 54:06.540
I think, uh, last week or the week before that may have cracked the code when it comes

54:06.540 --> 54:12.440
to backwards compatibility, that cracking of code requires me to purchase the game again.

54:12.440 --> 54:16.860
That doesn't sound like something I'm interested in and hopefully, cause I remember they did

54:16.860 --> 54:23.340
that like PlayStation three, I guess some of that it's in the realm of possibility where

54:23.340 --> 54:25.660
they could just say, Oh, you purchased it before.

54:25.660 --> 54:34.020
Now you get access to it, but this is Sony and they would be like, well, but we, we upscaled

54:34.020 --> 54:35.020
it.

54:35.020 --> 54:36.020
So now it's a new game.

54:36.020 --> 54:37.020
You have to re-buy it.

54:37.020 --> 54:39.180
Like Sony's going to give Microsoft a free weapon.

54:39.180 --> 54:43.520
If they do that, if they don't allow the disc based stuff to, at least the digital

54:43.520 --> 54:46.680
catalog has to roll over.

54:46.680 --> 54:47.680
Like the disc stuff.

54:47.680 --> 54:48.680
I get it.

54:48.680 --> 54:49.680
That might be a limitation.

54:49.680 --> 54:50.680
They just can't do it.

54:50.680 --> 54:55.160
But I mean, if one company can do it, I think they should be able to do it, but let's just

54:55.160 --> 54:56.760
say, okay, they can't do it.

54:56.760 --> 55:00.600
But if I purchase that on the PlayStation three store and I have it in my catalog, which

55:00.600 --> 55:05.680
all that's still in my PlayStation network account, then in theory, that should be just

55:05.680 --> 55:09.020
unlocked for me when it's available.

55:09.020 --> 55:12.040
But I, I'm not holding my breath for that.

55:12.040 --> 55:13.040
Yeah.

55:13.040 --> 55:16.840
I still, you know, obviously I want to see backwards compatibility as well, but we don't

55:16.840 --> 55:17.840
know anything official.

55:17.840 --> 55:22.300
There was some weird like commercial thing that had today's date with the retro and people

55:22.300 --> 55:27.060
thought that it looked like it really just was a new commercial and nothing about backwards

55:27.060 --> 55:28.060
compatibility.

55:28.060 --> 55:33.740
Um, so, or maybe Sony was going to say something, but they got the rug pulled under him with

55:33.740 --> 55:34.980
this announcement this week.

55:34.980 --> 55:35.980
I don't know.

55:35.980 --> 55:39.700
Um, so, you know, more, more to develop perhaps on this.

55:39.700 --> 55:46.660
Uh, but I, I think GDC, although we don't usually have these huge types of announcements

55:46.660 --> 55:49.540
at GDC, it's not for that.

55:49.540 --> 55:54.740
I could see them kind of dropping that hint there, but I don't know, maybe something soon.

55:54.740 --> 55:58.140
I mean, Sony is perfectly capable of just pushing out a state of play whenever they

55:58.140 --> 56:00.180
want, uh, to talk about this.

56:00.180 --> 56:04.140
So we'll see who knows, um, before we get to our next story.

56:04.140 --> 56:06.740
I want to go back cause chat is talking about this.

56:06.740 --> 56:10.820
They're still stuck on the Activision, uh, retro properties.

56:10.820 --> 56:18.020
Mike Deft in chat says, get playground studios who does Forza to make a new blur.

56:18.020 --> 56:20.740
Oh, that'd be amazing.

56:20.740 --> 56:21.740
Hmm.

56:21.740 --> 56:28.780
Look y'all, I don't want to be weird, but like, I'm a little horny thinking about that.

56:28.780 --> 56:32.220
That is actually a little weird, Rob.

56:32.220 --> 56:33.220
I'm sorry.

56:33.220 --> 56:39.260
The makers of Forza are doing a new blur, a little bit H word, a little bit H word.

56:39.260 --> 56:41.260
All right.

56:41.260 --> 56:42.260
Moving on.

56:42.260 --> 56:45.260
Darcy, what do you have for us?

56:45.260 --> 56:54.260
Um, well, uh, Moki hinted to this earlier, but, um, going back to the Activision Blizzard

56:54.260 --> 56:57.820
side of things, they have formed their first union.

56:57.820 --> 57:00.580
Well, the company didn't, but employees did.

57:00.580 --> 57:06.100
Um, actually technically employees at Raven software, which is owned by Activision Blizzard.

57:06.100 --> 57:08.660
Um, they formed a union.

57:08.660 --> 57:13.620
Um, it is, uh, made up of about 60 employees.

57:13.620 --> 57:19.340
Um, and it, of course they made their announcement just after, uh, Microsoft announcing that

57:19.340 --> 57:21.500
they were going to acquire Activision Blizzard.

57:21.500 --> 57:24.500
Um, actually I take that back.

57:24.500 --> 57:30.380
It's uh, the union is, uh, I mean, the union, yeah, it's a very small one, but it's

57:30.380 --> 57:39.420
very significant in the fact that this is one of the first unions at a major developer

57:39.420 --> 57:40.820
relatively.

57:40.820 --> 57:49.700
Um, this actually came to, uh, to fruition after, um, they had their walkout to protest,

57:49.700 --> 57:53.220
uh, the layoffs of contract workers that they said were unfair.

57:53.220 --> 58:00.420
Um, so they are wanting to have the changes in the company reflect the wants and needs

58:00.420 --> 58:05.220
of the gaming community and the workers that create the product that's, uh, stated by a

58:05.220 --> 58:08.260
quality assurance employee named Brent Real.

58:08.260 --> 58:14.540
Um, so the union is called the Game Workers Alliance union, um, again, the first at a

58:14.540 --> 58:20.540
publicly traded video game publisher and the second video game union in the US.

58:20.540 --> 58:25.020
It's going to be part of the Communications Workers of America, which is the largest union

58:25.020 --> 58:27.500
in the media industry.

58:27.500 --> 58:36.940
Um, so, uh, there are, it's going to be, it's a pretty big deal and hopefully it's going

58:36.940 --> 58:42.140
to, to spread, you know, start, start a bigger trend.

58:42.140 --> 58:48.340
Um, and on top of that, they're wanting to make sure that overall that they're really

58:48.340 --> 58:50.380
just improving the conditions.

58:50.380 --> 58:55.140
Um, they, um, they're waiting for the company to recognize them.

58:55.140 --> 58:56.820
They have until the 25th.

58:56.820 --> 59:04.220
So for us, that's two days from now to, uh, to, uh, recognize them or else there's probably

59:04.220 --> 59:07.140
going to be something big coming up.

59:07.140 --> 59:13.980
Um, and the only thing that Activation Blizzard ever did after that issue happened is that

59:13.980 --> 59:19.820
they raised their minimum compensation for Raven, um, for their QA employees and a few

59:19.820 --> 59:25.860
other benefits, but they really didn't do too terribly much, so that's it.

59:25.860 --> 59:30.300
It is kind of interesting, you know, because, uh, obviously my head kind of went to, oh,

59:30.300 --> 59:34.820
I wonder what the, you know, a better ABK folks think about, you know, everything that's

59:34.820 --> 59:38.880
happened with the Microsoft purchase and certainly I wasn't going to expect that like, oh, well,

59:38.880 --> 59:41.580
they've just magically dropped all their grievances.

59:41.580 --> 59:45.300
It is nice to see that the fight kind of continues in that regard.

59:45.300 --> 59:48.900
I think it will be very interesting to see what Microsoft sort of response is to this.

59:48.900 --> 59:54.900
And it seems so far their response is just radio silence, which honestly is the smart

59:54.900 --> 59:55.900
thing to do.

59:55.900 --> 01:00:01.180
Um, and in regards to that with the whole, you know, looming, uh, going under the microscope

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:05.560
with the antitrust and everything like that, um, it's going to be very interesting if Bobby

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:10.260
Kotick's legacy is, you know, all my workers unionized once I sold this company type of

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:15.580
thing, uh, is going to be interesting, but obviously I, I still fully support these folks

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.580
and wanting to unionize.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.860
It makes sense.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:23.340
You know, they, they've seen how bad it can get, uh, they've hit the bottom and they don't

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.220
want to ever go back there and they want to unionize to make sure a company can't take

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.220
them there.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.220
So who can blame them?

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.780
Whether it's Microsoft or even, you know, what's, what's like the most loved gaming

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.300
company in the world, probably Nintendo, maybe, I don't know, even if Nintendo bought them,

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.940
I wouldn't expect that this fight would stop.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.340
So, um, I think, I think that's, that's, that's pretty neat.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.340
So, um, we'll see what happens.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:49.780
One thing that happens with any sort of acquisition is that you can't just go in and make a huge

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.140
overhaul and expect success out of the business.

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.900
I mean, I think that that's what a lot of companies make the mistake of doing.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:05.460
It's going, an overhaul is needed, but I think it's going to have to come a bit more fluidly,

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:06.460
if that makes sense.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.460
Yeah.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.460
Yeah.

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.060
The reality is this deal still won't be finalized for what a year and a half.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.420
And that's a long time.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:17.780
And so, you know what, these unions could be up running and in place throughout Activision

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:19.380
Blizzard in that time.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:22.180
So we'll see.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.620
But I feel Spencer doesn't strike me as the type that's like, I'm going to shut it down

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.620
or whatever.

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:31.780
And, uh, you know, Microsoft does not seem to have the same, um, union busting within

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.440
its ranks.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.580
I thought it was very interesting, by the way, we didn't talk about this earlier, but

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:40.500
when Microsoft made that announcement, they posted a picture of their leadership.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.500
Interesting.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:45.220
It wasn't Activision Blizzard or any of them, but Microsoft's leadership.

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:50.060
And it was very much to show, look how many women are in the structure.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:54.260
And it was definitely flexing that, which is a good thing, but it's, I think in a way

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.780
it's also flexing.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:00.620
Look who's not here is Frances Townsend or whatever her name is, the union busting one.

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:04.540
And I really think that was the kind of flex that like, this is the team that's going to

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:05.540
run this.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.580
Um, and we don't have the same attitudes, so be interesting.

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.580
Interesting.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.580
All right.

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.380
Moving on in the mobile world, Loki.

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:15.380
Yes.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:23.100
Uh, so Pokemon Go has halted trading because apparently there was a bug in Pokemon Go that

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:27.580
was allowing the lucky Pokemon, which I think is like, was it like 50 50?

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:32.380
Um, I don't remember what the percentage is that you get a lucky Pokemon on trade, but

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.700
apparently it was unusually high.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:40.420
And so there was, um, a Reddit post where someone was able to get a hundred lucky Pokemon

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:45.140
in a very short span of time, that's supposed to be statistically impossible.

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:51.980
Um, and so now they're Niantic is investigating the issue because you can't have your lucky

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.980
Pokemon.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.660
Well, there's a follow up to what you're reading.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.220
It's it's back on again.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.300
They've resolved whatever it was.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.300
Yeah.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.500
Just I think just in time for the community day, I did mention it during my gaming week.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.180
I tried to do community day.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.340
Um, I did the Pikmin one.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:10.120
I walked to my 10,000 steps and we were doing an Ingers thing, a little minor thing for

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.120
that.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.320
Um, but, uh, I was doing a Pokemon later in the day.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.560
I only caught one shot.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.980
I just don't have luck with Bulbasaur.

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.820
I caught one shiny Bulbasaur.

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:19.820
That's it.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.340
And I had like two, uh, so at least I have three now, but, uh, it wasn't a very good

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.460
IV one.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:29.620
But the problem was I couldn't go pedal to the hours were bad.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.480
It was only two to five.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:36.020
They didn't run at the six hour window and I was hosting an event that started at five.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:40.260
So like I had to be done by like three 30 so I could get ready for the event I was hosting

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.260
last night.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:44.220
So I'm just kind of a bummer on the timing again.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:49.460
So whatever, but at least I can do lucky trades.

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.900
All right, moving on.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.440
Let's talk about, I had brought up cloud gaming earlier in the show.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.840
Let's talk about Sora gaming.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:02.480
Uh, let's talk about Kingdom Hearts.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.640
Kingdom Hearts is coming out for the switch and there was a trailer that was unveiled

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.600
that shows it will be out on February 10th.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.340
It is important to note these Kingdom Hearts games are cloud versions.

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:19.420
So you're going to be playing them on the cloud, which is not new for the switch.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.520
There have been other game releases for that.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.740
So you do need a consistent internet to play.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:28.420
So my internet after 7.15, which by the way is in a minute, so cross your fingers and

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:33.120
toes and hold your breath, is probably not as reliable for that.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:39.980
But for most people that have decent internet connections in the city and what have you,

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:42.100
it might be a way to play these games.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:50.300
I kind of think this is a little late and it makes more sense in Japan perhaps.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.420
But I guess there might be some people here that want to get into it, especially, I don't

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.900
know, maybe if the switch is the only one in your house because you have younger folks

01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:58.900
and what have you.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:03.020
I mean, I do get the logic behind it, but I just, I don't see this exactly being the

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:08.500
hot cake seller that I think it would have been some time ago.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.660
Now, there will be a demo.

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.280
In fact, it's actually out now if you want to try that on the eShop.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.400
They are also cloud versions.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.180
So I will give it that.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:23.060
You have free reign to test this and see what you think about the cloud gaming on the switch.

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:26.780
So you can make your own judgment on how your internet behaves and if it's the way you want

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.980
to play or not.

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:30.700
I think Control was one of the other games that did this.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:35.740
It had a demo on the shop and was a cloud game ultimately at the end of the day.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:40.500
There's also going to be a Kingdom Hearts 20th anniversary celebration stream that will

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.420
happen on April 10th.

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.300
Who knows if they'll announce anything special with that.

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.300
I don't know if you want to get your hopes up too much with that.

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.940
I don't think we're, well, I don't know.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:55.740
Over under on a Kingdom Hearts 4, folks?

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:56.900
It won't be 4.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:57.900
That's too normal.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.460
Oh yeah, you're right.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:12.140
We need Kingdom Hearts 3, Remind, Remaster, Redone, Under, 2-4 for Destiny's Kiss edition.

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:16.460
They'll have like some big like long calculus equation as part of the title.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.580
Yeah, for Dancing Stage.

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:21.580
True Kiss Destination.

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.580
All right.

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.580
Anyway, we'll see.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.260
We'll see what happens with that.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:30.180
But I would say they're not, they're not going to do a stream on April 10th and not announce

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.180
anything.

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:37.820
It could be as simple as that horrible theater them successor that they did.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:38.820
I'm sorry.

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:39.820
I did not like that game.

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:42.940
I think they're going to do a new one of those that I'm supposed to get excited about.

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:45.460
But we'll see.

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:49.660
What do y'all in chat think over twitch.tv slash vog network?

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:57.300
E3VL points out Kingdom Hearts all in one for PS4 usually goes for $30 versus the amount

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.060
that this is going to cost on the Switch.

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:00.580
That's a very good point as well.

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:01.580
That's sure.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:06.620
So if people don't have the other consoles, they'll pay what they want.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:12.700
Especially if it's something like get their kids on the game or something, you know.

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:13.700
All right.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:14.700
Moving on.

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.820
Dark Soccer, you have a good industry story, right?

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:18.820
I do.

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:26.780
So there was a survey that came out of the game developers conference where they did

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:30.180
their 10th edition state of the game industry.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:33.220
That was, I believe, last Thursday.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:39.100
But they pulled more than 2700 developers across a series of topics.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:45.580
And so 62 percent of the responders said their companies did nothing to engage with conversations

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:50.080
around misconduct and toxicity.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.540
They said also some respondents said that their companies don't have these problems,

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:58.700
but mostly because they were too small or they weren't based in the U.S. or their companies

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:03.420
had a zero tolerance policy or it wasn't something that they witnessed.

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:04.420
There was a yes.

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:09.820
But they said that in that survey, 38 percent of respondents said that their employees did

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.900
take action.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:18.020
And it is a growing trend in workplaces in the industry to have some initiative to root

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.140
out toxicity.

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:29.020
So what they're basically saying is, I mean, some of them are saying that it's a very North

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:39.220
American focus, but a lot of people are really just unhappy with how their leadership responds.

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.780
Some of the comments say they bury it, pretend it isn't a problem, they act like it's different.

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:47.300
There continue to be people harassed and silenced.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.540
I've had to force them to make internal statements.

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:53.540
We were affected by the Blizzard misconduct and we opted to say nothing.

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:57.500
My faith in big companies to do the right thing is non-existent.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.620
Another quote, no one is surprised by misconduct.

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:04.500
We've seen it or experienced it in some form or another in our career.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.180
Our companies spoke to trying to do better.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:12.660
They started creating classes and inviting speakers to inform and educate people.

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:17.460
They have another survey, according to the survey, actually, this is 23 percent of developers

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:22.500
polled said unions, talks have taken place at their studio and a lot of people say that

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.500
it's needed.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:29.100
Fifty-five percent of respondents say that they should unionize, but there are some that

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:34.580
are still, you know, resisting it, but that's the general consensus is that there needs

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:37.540
to be more done to combat toxicity.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:44.780
It's not happening, but it's starting to happen more, but it's not enough and that more people

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.900
are interested in unionizing.

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:53.540
Yeah, and, you know, it's it just goes to kind of underline and score when these Blizzard

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:59.020
Activision issues first came up that, you know, this was this is not a problem unique

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.020
to them.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:05.580
It was definitely exacerbated by them and, you know, enabled by Bobby Kotick, et cetera.

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:08.300
But you know, we've known that this is an issue throughout the industry.

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:12.220
You know, obviously, you've heard everything about Ubisoft and plenty, plenty, plenty of

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:13.220
other places.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.260
What happened to Riot Games previously, et cetera, et cetera.

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.660
List goes on and on and on.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:21.860
So I think this, you know, survey sort of just underscores the fact that a lot of these

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:25.180
problems are an industry problem.

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:31.120
And any leader of any game company, big, small, medium sized, should really be evaluating

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:37.540
some of the policies when it comes to investigating these sorts of issues and maybe passively

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:44.180
enabling some of these issues, which I think is happening way too far off than is the case.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:56.460
Well, silence and refusal to do anything is almost like a nonverbal endorsement.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:57.460
Yeah.

01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:04.500
That for the people who don't say anything and don't do anything, you are by your inaction

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:08.620
endorsing this behavior because it's not, in your mind, bad enough to say something

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:09.960
about it.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.580
And I think that's, you're complicit.

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:16.220
I think that's a real element of what's been happening in so many of these game companies

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:21.180
for far too long is it's just like, oh, those are personal issues we don't want to get into

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:27.300
or deal with or it's, you know, but it's, you know, there's definitely been a gross

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:33.120
culture in the industry for a long, long time underscored by what E3 used to look like when

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.800
we first started going.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.320
I have an analogy, actually.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.320
Sure.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:45.120
So if you imagine somebody who, say, has an illness or has like, OK, we're going to say

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:50.400
someone has a drinking problem, we're just going to start that.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.160
And maybe at first things seem kind of fun, you know, kind of, oh, we're loose, everything

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.720
is great here.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.280
And then they start having like a little bit of a liver problem or their skin gets bad.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:08.160
But they're not willing to do what it takes to fix those issues by taking care of the

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.200
core issue, which is the drinking, you know.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.180
And so after a while, they start going into liver failure.

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:19.480
They start having all these other issues happen.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.480
Things around them start going to shit.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.080
And we're seeing that in companies.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:30.380
It's kind of the same thing where, just use the biggest elephant.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:37.820
We have Activision Blizzard who things internally have gone so much to shit that they're being

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:45.500
acquired and companies around them are now affected by this, having to take a deep, hard

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.500
look.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:51.340
They're being scrutinized because of the type of behavior that they're endorsing.

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.500
It's all just that cycle.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:57.300
Yeah, good analogy.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.660
I can think of more, but we'll just get to our next.

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:00.660
I think that was a good analogy.

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:01.660
We'll leave it at that.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:05.020
So let's get to our next story.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:08.980
Speaking of things that are ugly and dark-sided, Loki.

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:10.200
Yeah.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.780
So we talked about this.

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:18.660
Not you, but what you're going to talk about, just to be clear, I meet that description.

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:24.880
But we were talking about another dark-sided evil person by the name of Ruben Sim, who

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:32.400
was banned from Roblox for apparently leading cyber mobs to harass the player base.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.400
He was also...

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.760
Can we think about that statement for a minute too?

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.380
Banned by Roblox?

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.760
Can we just marinate in that for a minute?

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.760
Yeah.

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.360
Well, there's more to it though.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.560
Remember, he also called in bomb threats to...

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.680
Oh, my God, this is the same guy?

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.680
Yeah.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:14:02.880
So apparently, according to the Oakland, California export, he had been issued, I guess, apparently

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.080
he was supposed to be not going back on Roblox.

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.600
They tried to ban him.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.640
He was also charged $160,000 for damages.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:22.160
Well, apparently, because it's a free-to-play game, he is circumventing their IP bans by

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:30.200
getting other people to create accounts for him, or I'm assuming the VPNs, perhaps.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:36.760
So he has been continually logging into Roblox and continuing his false threats of terrorism

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.160
activity relating to Roblox.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:49.000
And also, apparently, he is supposed to be not able to gain access to the platform, not

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.160
make false statements about the game and its employees or go near its offices, post

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.160
or republish those threats as well.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:06.480
And apparently, he is now forced into a temporary lockdown while local police and private security

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.880
conducted a search of a secure facility.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.400
I guess he had made some more threats regarding the developers conference.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:19.080
I don't know if there's anything more they could really do to keep him off the platform

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.240
if it's so easy for him to get back on there.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:24.280
Why isn't he in jail is what I want to know.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:30.040
I'm reminded of this meme I've seen on the internet of, I'm trying to get it to come

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.560
up here, I'm reminded of this meme I've seen online on the internet of Baby Bop holding

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.440
a stop sign saying, basically saying, you need to stop.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.200
And that is what I think somebody needs to send this person in the mail or some other

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.920
way to tell this person that they really need to stop.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.920
This is beyond the point of ridiculousness.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:57.080
So apparently, he has a huge following on YouTube and he's still posting videos on this

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.080
thing as well.

01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.480
And YouTube needs to start taking his channel down.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.600
I agree with that too, for sure.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:09.120
Well, Roblox is suing him for $1.6 million, so this should hopefully get him the stop.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.200
I think that there's something wrong with this guy.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:12.800
Do you think?

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.520
Well, if nothing else, maybe a lawsuit will finally shut him up.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.080
I doubt it.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.440
Well, yeah, it's true.

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.960
Now, it'll just be YouTube's about the lawsuit, but I do agree YouTube should probably

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.000
deplatform him so he can yell and scream into the void.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.320
All right.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:35.400
Well, lots of people have been yelling and screaming in the YouTube void about the

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:41.440
Nintendo Switch Online emulator and how it wasn't very good for certain Nintendo 64

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.320
games, which kind of sucks when Nintendo's charging a premium.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.160
And people honestly thought that, well, we'll probably just have to deal with this

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.600
forever because when's Nintendo going to bother to patch these emulators?

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.400
Well, plot twist.

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.960
It turns out Nintendo patched the emulator.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:05.120
So Nintendo, I think they just put out this week was Banjo-Kazooie this week.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:10.800
Yeah, so Banjo-Kazooie just came out as part of the N64 library on January 20th.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.120
So that added to the library.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.080
And by the way, Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask is coming in February.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.200
So, you know, adding new games is not unheard of.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.120
And we knew some of those were coming.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.720
But what's interesting is that when they and I think they've done this too, is that, you

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.320
know, that Nintendo Online application is basically an all in one app that they just

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.040
add the new games into it.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.000
I don't think it's like talking to a server or anything like that.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.920
I think they're just patching that game over and over.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:43.440
So or patching that executable or whatever you want to call it over and over with the

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.800
new games. Well, it turns out they actually patched the emulator as a part of this too.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:53.320
It was spotted on Twitter that the Nintendo 64 emulator does a better job at displaying

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:56.200
water in the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:02.760
The fog is still missing, but it sounds like the water temple is like actually playable

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.880
now at this point, whereas in the emulator as it stood before, it was virtually

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:13.720
unplayable. So I think it's worth noting Nintendo is updating the emulator, not just

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:18.840
with new games, but fixing and addressing some of these issues, even if it's not perfect

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:25.640
yet. E3VL in chat asks, they have a roadmap now just for the next month or two.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.760
Just we know that Majora's Mask is coming, but we don't really know beyond that.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.000
We've had a bunch of shit teased in the trailer, but we don't know exactly when those

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.120
games are coming out. But it is nice to see someone fix that.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:42.280
So someone is assigned to making the emulator better or trying to work on some of these

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:47.040
issues. So that is refreshing to see, because I think many of us were kind of resigned to

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:52.040
the fact that Nintendo was not going to do shit about shit with it, with the emulator

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.240
and just take your money and laugh with it all the way to the bank.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:59.800
So it is nice to see Nintendo should be applauded for doing the right thing.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.840
So I will give them one clap.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.000
Here we go. There you go.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.280
One clap for doing the right thing in this circumstance.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.240
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh, so you can beat the water temple?

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.240
I kid, although I didn't do it until a few years ago.

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:17.120
Well, it's a little easier now for sure.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:23.520
SG100Matt in chat says, no Super Nintendo or NES Nintendo online updates.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.120
What?

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:26.520
What a shot.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:31.520
I thought we were paying all of this money and this expansion passes and stuff, and I'm

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.160
not getting more content.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.880
I am so surprised.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:41.880
You mean the base level Nintendo online people are getting jack and shit now?

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.440
I am so shocked.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.960
This is totally new information that was unexpected.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.240
Got some vital information.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:20:02.680
All right, maybe, maybe we need our next segment and a time when things weren't so complicated.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:18.960
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.840
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.960
It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.960
And Dark Sakura, what did you pick for episode 900's Classic Game of the Week?

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:31.760
Pick Dear Esther.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:41.720
Dear Esther is a first person exploration game developed by the Chinese Room.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:47.600
It came out for Windows OS X, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:54.440
It was released in 2008 as a free to play mod for the Source game engine.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:21:00.720
And then it was redeveloped entirely for a commercial release in 2012.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.160
It is a very minimalistic game.

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.480
You basically just explore.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:13.760
It's an island in Scotland and you listen to a man who is reading a series of letters to

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.920
his, excuse me, deceased wife.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:21.800
And then you learn about how she died over the course of the exploration.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:30.120
This is the same company, by the way, that did Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, just so

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:36.360
that, you know, in 2017, they did an updated version called Dear Esther Landmark Edition

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.960
that was released based in Unity.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:49.200
Anyway, like I said, you explore this island, listening to the man reading a series of letter

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:55.120
fragments to Esther, his deceased wife, and you reach new locations in the game.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.280
And that plays a letter fragment that relates to that area.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:05.880
The different fragments are revealed in each playthrough of the game.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.280
So you get a slightly different narrative each time.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.880
Several other characters are referred to by the narrator.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.440
You have a man named Donnelly who charted the island.

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:21.200
Paul, who is the drunk driver that suggested, was involved in Esther's death.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:26.280
A shepherd named Jacobson who lived on the island in the 18th century.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.400
And then you find these remains of buildings, a shipwreck, a cave system.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.760
The cave system is my favorite part of this game, by the way.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.560
And you get you see like different images on the cave walls that have like chemical

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:42.360
diagrams, circuit diagrams, neurons, bacteria, different things like that.

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:48.200
And you also see a figure walking away in the distance, but they vanish before you can

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:52.120
find them. And it does have a little bit of an ambiguous ending to it.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.640
It is a very beautiful game.

01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:05.680
I think that it's really absolutely worth everyone playing through at least once.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:11.840
But to go back into the development history of this game, it was a source engine mod

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.240
that was developed by the Chinese room.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:16.120
Well, they were part of a research project for the University of Portsmouth.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:22.760
They were funded by a grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and it was

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:27.200
led by Dan Pinchbeck, who is a professor at the university.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:36.080
He developed the story and the script and he cited the works of William S. Burroughs

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:43.760
in the writing, particularly to the way it would be image heavy and symbolic.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:46.800
So, you know, trying to do a different sort of narrative.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:59.040
So basically, an independent game artist named Robert Briscoe worked on redeveloping

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.880
Dear Esther in 2009 under Pinchecks support.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:11.160
So he in the Chinese room worked on the remake with redoing some of the level design

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:14.640
and using concept art by a man named Ben Andrews.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.200
They redesigned the game's landscape, they tried to remove some of the confusion with

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:27.080
the original layout and make the environment richer and more compelling instead of just

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.840
completely barren landscape in the original.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:38.280
But the Chinese room lost their backing and then they ended up finding backing instead

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:43.880
by the Indie Fund, who didn't really want to do it at first.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.520
After the demo, they're like, oh, this is cool.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.600
And they funded it.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:55.560
After so the game went through it, once they were playing it, people were like, oh,

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:56.640
heck yeah, this is rad.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.560
Other people who were a bit iffy on it.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:07.160
So to let you know, once the game was released on Steam, within the first six

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:12.600
hours, they sold 16000 units and it allowed the developers to pay back the Indie Fund

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:21.800
investment. Their narrator was Nigel Carrington, who had an extended script for the

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:28.520
remake. The music was done by Pinchbeck's wife, Jessica Curry, who's a freelance music

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.520
composer and the co-director of the Chinese room.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:36.520
And then she completely overhauled and reorchestrated it for the commercial release,

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:41.520
basically doubling the length of the original soundtrack, which the original game

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.320
soundtrack was available on July 8th, 2008.

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:50.440
And then there is a remastered soundtrack that was available as of February 14th, 2012

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.160
on Amazon, iTunes and Bandcamp.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:26:00.480
The original release of it was selected for the animation exhibition in the 2008

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:06.760
Pre-Arts Electronica and made ModDB's top 100 mods of 2008.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:13.160
And in 2009, the game won award for Best World Story at Indie Arcade Independent Games

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:23.360
Awards. It got a lot of praise and attached to emotions that not many people would

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.360
address in the game like unhappiness.

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:35.560
And as for the commercial release, it got some pretty great reviews, 75 out of 100 on

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:40.720
Metacritic. There are people who are like, oh, is this a game or is this just a story

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.640
that you participate in?

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.720
Some people said that the story seemed pretty obscure and a little hard to follow.

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:59.520
It got anywhere between really positive reviews and some slightly mediocre reviews,

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.760
so it really depends on who you ask.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:10.760
The game was considered, though, a graphical masterpiece and that it also won at the

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.760
Independent Games Festival in 2012.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:21.880
It received the prize for excellent in visual arts, awarded them the prize for best use of

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.960
narrative in the 2012 awards.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:32.840
TIGA Games Industry Awards of 2012 gave it the Originality Award and Best Action

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:37.400
Adventure Game, Best Visual Design, Best Audio Design, Best Debut Game, and it was

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:42.000
nominated for five awards at the 9th British Academy Video Games Awards.

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.880
As of September 2013, it sold over 850,000 copies.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.600
And there you go.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:57.680
Dear Esther, I played through this at work, like a few years ago.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:04.560
A lot of people in chat are doing the whole OMG because our criteria for the classic game

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.320
of the week, if you are not aware, is a game needs to be at least 10 years old, which is

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.720
funny because now we get a lot of games that are our show is older than them, but they

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.320
still classify for classic game of the week.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:19.520
And yes, Dear Esther isn't just 10 years old folks, it's 14 years old.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.240
14 years old because I'm going by the original release date.

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:31.760
However, it will be considered commercially 12 years old next month.

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:38.680
And also, when you kind of talk about the whole, it was very critically polarizing.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.440
I think it really was the first of those walking simulator games.

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:45.360
I think some people try to use that label as a negative.

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.680
I look at it as a little bit more empowering.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.960
And I think those types of games are very divisive.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.720
I enjoy Dear Esther.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.800
I didn't enjoy it as much.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.040
I think it's beautiful.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:01.080
But I agree that the story is a little harder to follow than maybe when the Chinese room

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:01.920
did their follow up.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:08.440
Everybody's gone to the rapture, which is probably one of the best video games I've

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.920
played, which and I think that studio kind of fell apart, didn't they?

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.760
No, they were purchased by Sumo.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.200
Oh, OK.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:23.520
And in 2020, they did a game called Little Orpheus, and it's actually an Apple arcade

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.400
game, which I'm going to look into it.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:29.640
Honestly, in 2017, they also did a game called So Let Us Melt.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.240
But I didn't know about that one.

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.400
I'm going to have to look that one up and see what kind of game it is.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:42.000
And yeah, the music, the music in this game is gorgeous, as was again, I hate to keep

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.800
comparing it to everybody's gone to the rapture, but I'm going to because that was, you

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.160
know, I'd heard of Dear Esther.

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.000
I wasn't really motivated to look at it until I play.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.920
Everybody's gone to the rapture and just thought it was brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:55.120
I will.

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.120
This game is is gorgeous.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.200
If nothing else.

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:04.760
Yes, go walk in it and just explore the environment, because even for being 2008 now,

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.000
granted, I don't know if we're watching like a play through of like a remaster because I

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.480
know they kind of upped it up a little bit when they did like the PS4 release and stuff.

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:19.360
But even still, this game is gorgeous today and is worth looking at just for like Dark

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.160
Soccer was talking about the cave system is really cool.

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:24.640
In fact, those watching live on Twitch were seeing a little bit of that right now.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:29.760
But I love the way the clouds look and the sky looks like it's just such a damn good

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:34.560
looking game. You just get a little Orpheus actually got really good reviews.

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:37.040
For the record, and it is on Apple Arcade.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:41.440
And on top of that, it looks like the developers actually reply to the reviews.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.640
Oh, like Loki.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.800
Just all right.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.840
But all right.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.240
There it is, your classic game of the week, a good one, a little unexpected for for

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.560
around nine hundred.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:31:00.120
But at the same time, it's it's such a genre starter.

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:03.520
You know, it is I mean, a game is a very notable game.

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:09.160
I mean, I'm actually tempted to do a new stream of that game.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.600
I've been thinking about it either that I was actually, you know, it's me, Holly.

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:15.960
Oh, yeah, she's great.

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:21.720
Yeah, well, she's doing some other kind of narrative games and I suggest it because

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.600
she's playing Firewatch.

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.480
Oh, OK. That's another good one.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:29.040
And I suggested everybody's gone to the rapture and she seemed really interested in

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.160
because I honestly enough that game is is.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.600
Both of these games are masterpieces, in my opinion.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:40.960
Yeah, and again, I know it's been a while since I've advocated for this game on the

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.400
show, so please let me take a moment.

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.840
If you've never played, everybody's gone to the rapture.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:48.840
You really need to it is and it is not action packed.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:51.080
It is not shooty shooty bang bang.

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:58.200
But it is like just the music, the environments, the story is so good.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.720
Like I have a clamp just thinking about it.

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:00.680
That game is so good.

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.880
So it's just I want more more.

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.080
It's it's art.

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.320
It's art, mama.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.800
It's art. But is it art?

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.560
It's art. All right.

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.480
Indeed. All right.

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.280
Let's move on with some other quick headlines here in the segment we call Rapid Fire News.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.880
Loki. Yeah.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.760
So there is a program called Playdate Pulp, which is out of beta.

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:27.200
It is a game making development tool that you can use for the play date, which is that

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:32.600
kind of handheld monochrome console with the crank on the side that I don't know when

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:37.000
that's coming out. But if you want to make games for it, you can check it out for free.

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.360
So that's pretty awesome.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:40.880
It looks neat.

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:45.040
I'd be curious to see what I could do with it, but I don't have a play date to play any

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:51.240
of this on. So I don't know what I would do with it, but it's kind of all in one.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:56.360
So if you're interested in check it out at play date slash pulp.

01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:04.680
And then we have news that Dying Light 2 will include a free PlayStation 5 and Xbox

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:13.040
Series X update or upgrade since they're going to be shipping, I guess, with I don't know

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:18.240
if those are coming out at the same time, but apparently, yeah, if you pick it up, you're

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:21.120
going to be able to get those updates.

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:22.040
So that's kind of cool.

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:29.400
And then they're going to have three different rendering modes, and they've got a quality

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.360
and resolution mode.

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.360
So I'm guessing that the quality is going to add ray tracing and then resolution will

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:40.600
be at 4K performance is going to be rendering at 60 FPS.

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:50.680
So you can pick one, you give it more resolution, ray tracing, FPS, pick one.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.320
I think FPS is going to win out, though.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.120
I did want to before I get to Dark Soccer's headlines, Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out

01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.360
about the Playdate pulp that there is a Playdate emulator with that.

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.760
So it's a way for you to play those games if you'd like.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:03.800
So there is that.

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.520
All right. And dark Tetsuya said, oh, darn, I was going to ask when the Pixel Poops number

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.280
two port was coming to the Playdate.

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.040
So I guess I guess another time.

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:13.680
All right. Dark Soccer.

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:19.720
Yeah. So speaking, though, back to Dying Light, Dying Light 2 and Life is Strange

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:22.200
remaster have been delayed for the Switch.

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:30.600
They were supposed to be coming out very soon.

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:37.240
Instead, they're looking that they're going to be coming out much later than the next

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:43.000
month. The other platforms, though, should have Life is Strange remastered on February

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.240
1st and Dying Light 2 on February 4th.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:55.160
And then in sad news, pinball designer Lyman Sheets died and we're all very sad.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:03.000
He did like the last action hero, Tommy and Guns N' Roses, of which I have owned a last

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.600
action hero and Guns N' Roses.

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.000
All right. Can I tell him?

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:14.280
Oh, and he also apparently worked on Medieval Madness.

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:20.360
Speaking of celebrities who passed away, can I tell you maybe a slightly tasteless joke,

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.760
but I thought it was really good.

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:23.480
It's a tender subject.

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:26.080
It's along those same lines.

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:30.240
OK, so Meat Loaf passed away this week, obviously, as we know.

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:34.280
And, you know, we should take a moment to remember Meat Loaf for who he was.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:40.200
He had incredible contributions to music, incredible contributions to film and things

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:46.840
like Rocky Horror. And in his final years and in his final years was a raging lunatic

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.720
that subscribed to conspiracy theories and said some bad things.

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:51.720
But but two out of three ain't bad.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.200
That still is a tender subject.

01:35:58.240 --> 01:35:59.800
All right, moving on.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:00.480
Rob gets it.

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.760
I saw that in a tweet.

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.040
I massaged the language a little bit, made it my own.

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.560
But I'm going to tell that one at the next Rocky Horror.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:08.240
So be ready for it.

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:14.360
I still thought that there were people who were having Meat Loaf for dinner that night.

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:22.760
Yeah, all right, Tiger Claw points out, we also lost Louie Anderson, who are a lot of

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:25.720
people remember that show he had the was it Louie's Kids or something like that?

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:32.760
I remember the Family Feud revival he hosted for years and years and years and him doing

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:38.200
that. So, yeah, apparently I never really saw a lot of his comic stuff.

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.080
But my understanding is he was a pretty bang up stand up comic.

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.760
So, yeah, oh, boy.

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:48.240
And then, you know, of course, we lost Betty White right at the end of last year.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.440
And I mean, right at the end of last year.

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.080
Did you see a new video of her came out?

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:51.920
Sidney Poitier.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.680
Oh, yeah, Sidney Poitier. But but a new Betty White video came out and that's what I was

01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.680
getting to is that something she had filmed, it looked like like an interlude, maybe for

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:06.240
her hundredth thing. But it was really it was days before she ended up passing.

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.320
And it was just it was nice to see her, even if it was, you know, difficult knowing what

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.000
happened soon after. But, yeah, had me thinking about that.

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:21.600
Let's see, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Webber Grill had their Friday recipe email come

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:24.040
out that day, which was a meatloaf recipe.

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.720
They issued an apology.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.960
You know what? That's that's the problem with auto scheduling your social media posts.

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:33.360
I wouldn't have apologized for that.

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:37.000
Like he's the one the food was first.

01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.680
He named himself after the food.

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.960
His name. His name was Robert Paulson.

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.120
His name was Robert.

01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.200
Actually, no, it was Marvin today.

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:44.240
But still. All right.

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:46.640
Let's move on in serious news.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.480
Let's get to world release dates and release dates in different countries, starting with

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.320
the U.S. Loki.

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:57.840
Yes. So this week we have the Artful Escape on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation

01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:02.040
5, Gunvolt Chronicles, Luminous Avenger, I.X.

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:09.720
2. That's on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox series.

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:18.360
Pokemon Legends, Arxius, better known as Unity 3D presents Pokemon Legends, Arxius.

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:25.280
That is on Nintendo Switch and then better that are also known as check Shane's Twitter

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.640
because he posts about literally nothing else lately.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.680
I saw some screenshots from it and yikes.

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:35.080
And yeah, I'm intrigued.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:36.440
I'm going to buy it. I'm a play it.

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:41.440
I'm intrigued. Uncharted Legacy of Thieves collection on PlayStation five.

01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:42.600
And that's it.

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:47.280
I will say you do know I love me a drag queen tangent.

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:49.800
So Dark Soccer, I bet you haven't seen this yet.

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:55.120
It is a little spoilery for Arceus if you are trying to keep yourself hidden from new

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.040
Pokemon and new forms that are in the game.

01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:02.160
So if you are trying to keep yourself pure from that, don't look this up.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.480
But Dark Soccer, I feel like you probably don't give a shit.

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.080
Look at Aquarius Twitter, the winner of Drag Race Season 10 Aquaria.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.960
She did with one day's notice.

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:17.280
She did an outfit based on one of the leaks from Pokemon Legends Arceus.

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.160
It's pretty amazing.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:21.480
So I figured you might appreciate that.

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.040
So I'm trying to find it.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.880
It would have been a few days ago. So sorry.

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.320
I don't know how. Oh, damn.

01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:28.840
Yeah. Nice, huh?

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.520
Yeah. Yeah.

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:33.080
I wish I could show you the original picture again.

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.800
I don't want to I don't want to broadcast it because I know some people are sensitive

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:38.800
about spoilers, but I know Arxis Arxis.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.480
I don't know how to pronounce it, nor do I care.

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:42.800
Arceus Arceus.

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.400
I thought it was Arceus. That's how I've heard most people saying it.

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:48.360
But OK, Arceus.

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:55.840
All right, well, let's move on and talk about Japanese release dates on the switch.

01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:02.400
In Japan this week, on the 27th, we have Kamigami no Asobe Luderi Deorum Unite edition.

And we have Magatsu Barai in a regular and limited edition.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.640
They love their limited editions overseas.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:32.400
We also have a few other games coming out.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.520
We have a Grand Theft Auto Trilogy Definitive Edition gets a Japanese release this week.

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.880
Well, that's that's nice. Maybe they finally worked out those bugs.

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:42.520
And Star Melody Yumemi Dreamer comes out in Japan this week.

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:50.000
And there's one more, Shika Banagurai no Bokenmeshi comes out in Japan.

01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.800
It's a very busy week in Japan on the switch.

01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.960
Quickly looking to see if we have anything on the PlayStation 5 this week.

01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:00.800
We have some peripheral color things.

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.640
Oh, the I think those are the official releases.

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.720
The console covers are out this week in Japan.

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:11.520
But otherwise, we have the Uncharted Legacy of Thieves collection gets its PlayStation 5 release

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
and that really pretty purple wireless controller as well.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.360
So there is that.

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.160
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:23.760
On the 27th, we have Rugby 22.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:29.600
We also have Pokemon Legends Arceus on the 28th for Switch for PlayStation.

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:36.400
Also on the 28th, we have the following four games, Human Fall Flat Anniversary Edition,

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:43.880
Wanderer PSVR, Horror Tales and Uncharted Legacy of Thieves collection.

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:46.840
All right.

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:51.680
By the way, yeah, before I forget, and I should have done this right at the beginning,

01:41:51.960 --> 01:42:00.120
I want to thank Blaxican for the shout out that he gave us in his channel right before we went live.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.200
So, oh, that was very nice of him.

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:02.600
Thank you.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:07.880
I was watching him earlier today, but I wasn't watching before showtime.

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.160
So that's very kind.

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:09.760
Thank you.

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:10.320
Shout out.

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.720
I appreciate that.

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:16.640
Yeah, it's it's been an interesting year with you and I both participating more on Twitch,

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.200
especially you, to be quite honest, participating more on Twitch.

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:26.120
It's it's really cool, like all the people we've been able to meet this year and network with.

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.280
And I really hope we get to continue that in next year.

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:34.840
And I hope we get to do more of that in person with events like, you know, Twitch Con and just conventions,

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.920
you know, just fingers and toes crossed that this COVID thing can get a little more under control.

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:45.920
I know it's probably going to always be endemic, but, you know, at least maybe we can look at it a little more like the flu

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:49.400
and we can actually do things in person again would be really, really wonderful.

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:55.600
So it'd be great to meet some of y'all very kind people from the land of Twitch.

01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:56.120
Thank you.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:57.320
All right.

01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:59.640
I will be at Dragon Con come hell or high water.

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:00.960
If they have one, I'm going.

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:06.920
And I don't see why they won't have one at this point, because we know a lot of the basic precautions big shows can take at this point.

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:10.640
So I really do want to go to Twitch Con, but.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:16.480
I'm still iffy about conventions anyway, but I want to meet my friends.

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:17.480
Yeah, I get it.

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:24.200
And I'm and I now get to I now get to officially put myself in the immunocompromised bucket after my recent diagnosis.

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:28.240
So, yeah, it's all about precautions, precautions, precautions.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.760
Yeah, but honestly, Dragon Con was great.

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:38.240
Every like the thing that made it good was that everybody just fucking played by the rules.

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:43.880
I didn't see people trying to hide without their mask or something like that or anything like that.

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:54.920
Like, I'm sorry, I know I'm talking about a convention that happened months ago, but still, like, I just wish everything was like that, where everybody understood the rules and knew what they needed to do and just fucking followed it.

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.960
And it was beautiful.

01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:59.200
Like, I just wish we could get to that for everything.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:43:59.600
All right.

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:07.640
Anyway, off my high horse onto Loki's high horse and a franchise that he has had a lot to say about in the last few months.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:08.160
Right, Loki?

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:24.280
Yeah, so there was an interview with CEO Strauss Zelnick of Take-Two in his comments regarding Grand Theft Auto, the definitive trilogy.

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:31.320
And here it's just ridiculous how much he downplays what's happened with the thing.

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:36.040
So he says, and with the regards to the GTA trilogy, that was actually not a new title.

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:38.280
It was a remaster of pre-existing titles.

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:45.120
We did have a glitch in the beginning and that glitch was resolved and the title has done just great for the company.

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.600
So we're very excited.

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.840
We have an amazing pipeline going forward.

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:50.800
One singular glitch, Loki.

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:51.720
One, one glitch.

01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:53.920
There was a glitch in the matrix.

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:57.520
Somebody, some oops, all berries.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.200
Sorry.

01:44:58.200 --> 01:44:59.680
It was a little bit of a glitch.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:00.520
Sorry about that.

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:00.880
I'm sorry.

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:06.240
That's not, no, that is not a glitch.

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:12.080
That, that is just a complete failure at putting together a product.

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:18.560
Like, no, he's a terrible human being as far as the CEO goes.

01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:22.560
Like we'll get Kotick out of the way.

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:26.520
Uh, as far as we know, he's not, you know, harassing women.

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.840
So at least he's got that going for him right now.

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:32.680
But he's still, it's still just like a very toxic company.

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:36.360
Uh, pixel pockets and chat says one glitch as a treat.

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.040
Uh, he three VL and chat says, did they fix the rain?

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.720
Did they fix these glitches?

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.080
They did fix the rain.

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:43.840
They did.

01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:44.400
Finally.

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.680
They basically, they waited for everybody and make the big definitive list of all the bugs.

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:51.120
And then they went and fixed those bugs.

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:52.520
How nice.

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:54.360
It was just a glitch.

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.320
It is only a glitch, like glitch.

01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:57.800
My God.

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.840
That's how I'm going to review their next game.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:02.960
It's just a little glitch.

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:04.880
Moving on.

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:10.760
Uh, I don't know how glitchy your list for this will be, but, uh, mine's probably going to show a lot of, uh, I don't know.

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:14.000
I don't, I don't know if I played a lot of PlayStation in 2021, to be honest.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Cause, uh, a lot of my game time was on my series X, but, um, I'll probably final fantasy 14 when I played on PlayStation for a bit.

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:24.200
Uh, I'm talking about the PlayStation wrap up.

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.800
Uh, it breaks down statistics of your PlayStation four and your PlayStation five play for 2021.

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:32.440
I know, aren't we getting towards the end of January?

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.200
Why aren't we still talking about 2021?

01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:36.240
Well, this site launched this week.

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:45.840
It just took a little bit of time to get going, but you can go to wrapup.playstation.com and you can look at your stats for PlayStation four and five for 2021.

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:52.160
Uh, when you connect your PlayStation account, you can see how many hours you spent on different PlayStation game games.

01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:56.680
Excuse me, the five games you played the most and what trophies you got throughout the year.

01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:58.440
Cause I know some of you loved a trophy hunt.

01:46:58.440 --> 01:46:59.040
That's for sure.

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:08.080
Um, you can also see your playtime breakdown between PlayStation four and PlayStation five, which in my case, I never touched a PlayStation five with my account.

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:12.600
I touched it when I visited Bobby Black Wolf, but it was on his account.

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.200
Um, Oh, you do get PlayStation VR.

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:21.800
So there's that if, if you were using that in the last year, uh, also, uh, some games got like.

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:22.920
Global stats.

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:32.840
So for example, death stranding director's cuts, the community has traveled 45 million kilometers and delivered 9.4 million packages.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.760
12 million hours of returnal had been played.

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:41.080
34.6% of Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart players got all of the weapons.

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:42.720
So there you go.

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:47.720
You have to have played at least 10 hours of games on PlayStation four or five to get your stats.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:56.360
And it's not going to work if you're a PlayStation fly at five player who did not allow full data collection and consent to the additional data collection.

01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:57.240
Oh, I see.

01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.680
That's how they're going to lure you in is with the cute stats.

01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:00.520
There you go.

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.480
So, uh, E3VL says, did they send an email for that?

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.400
No, I don't think they did.

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.720
I think they just blasted it with social media posts.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.840
Uh, but again, you can get one at wrapup.playstation.com.

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:16.840
If you missed it, by the way, Xbox, I don't know if it's still up, but Microsoft had a really cool.

01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:33.280
Uh, 20th anniversary museum thing, and I'm sorry, I don't have the link, but I'm sure one of y'all in chat, we'll dig it up real quick here and I'll read it out if it's a short link, but that was a really cool thing that showed like what Xbox game have you played the most of, which I was convinced it was going to be no man's sky.

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:44.640
But as it turns out, Mass Effect three was my most ever played Xbox game, which makes sense because not only was it like what, 30 hours of single player mode, how much multiplayer and Mass Effect three did we play over the years?

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:45.240
A lot.

01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:46.040
God, so much.

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:46.320
Yeah.

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.640
So I was like, Oh, that's why it was so much.

01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:51.840
So, um, but that was another really cool thing to check out.

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:54.120
And then, yeah, Nintendo kind of sent theirs on email, I think.

01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:55.240
So kind of neat.

01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:56.520
All right.

01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:57.800
Uh, moving on dark soccer.

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:08.040
So, um, going back to Twitch, um, there are streamers now, uh, campaigning for a disability pride month.

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:13.160
Um, of course they run awareness campaigns for different communities.

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.120
There's been pride.

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:15.280
There's been black history month.

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.560
Hispanic heritage month.

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:28.480
Um, so now, uh, there is a call, um, from the user voice forum, uh, for uplifting, uh, Twitch streamers with disabilities.

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:33.600
Um, they're wanting to have, uh, different streamers be highlighted.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:47.880
Um, uh, especially some folks with invisible disabilities as well, um, to, uh, bring awareness that yes, people with various different disabilities do play games and do enjoy them and stream them.

01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:52.640
So, uh, The, uh, I'll find the link for everybody.

01:49:52.640 --> 01:50:01.000
It's on the Twitch, uh, twitch.uservoice.com, but I will put the link in chat, uh, for the people who are here.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.120
Um, yeah, I'd sign that.

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:04.520
I think that's a great idea.

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:13.200
Um, I know there's, uh, all sorts of people that stream on this platform and it's always nice to see people different than you who also love video games because video games are for everyone.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.080
Here's my small confusion.

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:18.760
Um, and I appreciate a little, um, kind education on this.

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:31.000
Um, I thought that the term disability was something we were trying to get away from and say differently abled, but then I also saw with this campaign, they were saying disability is not a dirty word.

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:36.960
So I'm not, what's, what's the, have we reached a consistently abled was probably created by abled people.

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:37.880
Hmm.

01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:38.560
Interesting.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:38.920
Okay.

01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:49.240
And it's the same way as a bunch of these neuro-typical people deciding that we need to be called people with autism instead of autistic people without consulting us.

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:50.200
Okay.

01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:53.000
I said someone please educate me on it.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.200
So I'm just, I'm just curious about that.

01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:00.400
So, uh, dark to see in chat says definitely a cause near and dear to my heart as well as my wife's.

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.200
So I would definitely appreciate something like that from Twitch.

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:04.560
Yeah, absolutely.

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:12.920
I think the more we see different gamers, uh, and all sorts of people that game, uh, the better across, we get the message that gaming is for everyone.

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:25.240
And I think when you have that awareness, like, um, you know, somebody who is, let's just say somebody who is colorblind playing a game and explaining maybe like how they see the game and how things are different.

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:36.320
Like it kind of just makes you more aware, like, Oh, this is why, you know, sometimes there's these different settings and games or why a UI might've been designed this way or a certain thing was picked that way.

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:41.120
And that's just one of many examples, obviously that I'm, I'm thinking about.

01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:43.760
So, all right, great.

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:47.440
Uh, then definitely, uh, Oh, thank you at dark soccer already linked that in chat there.

01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:50.680
Uh, it's a long link, so I can't read it for the podcast folks.

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:55.280
Sorry, but, uh, it is on the forums at twitch.uservoice.com.

01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:57.080
Okay.

01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:03.840
Moving on a few, uh, a few, uh, I guess, humorous stories here to close out our ninth hundredth episode Loki.

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:05.680
Yes.

01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:13.040
So the, the franchise, even wanting more games for, I'm happy to tell you that they're bringing it back.

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:22.640
So, uh, microids is they've signed a brand new deal to bringing three brand new Garfield games.

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:23.360
That's right.

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:25.040
You thought Garfield go was great.

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.800
You thought Garfield cart was great.

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:30.840
I have no idea what they're going to make, but it's going to be Garfield.

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:38.880
Um, so yes, let's, let's wait in anticipation for more Garfield.

01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:40.640
How about not?

01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.360
As long as they don't release it on a Monday.

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.840
How about just give me some lasagna?

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:47.360
Sure.

01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:52.880
How, how, how do they not have Garfield brand lasagna available at target?

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.640
Like, how is that, how is that food collaboration?

01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:56.640
Like that missed opportunity.

01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:58.160
Why is Garfield in games?

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:00.120
Garfield should be in the frozen foods aisle.

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:06.840
Yeah, maybe, uh, Ziba and chat says we need more Snoopy games.

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:12.440
Sacred Jade said, and most likely Gar Baj to go with Garfield.

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:12.840
Get it?

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:13.160
Yeah.

01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:14.840
Womp, womp.

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:18.920
Well, the last Garfield game I played was Garfield go.

01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:22.200
And yep, that's something I played.

01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:22.720
All right.

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.720
I, I spent time on that.

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:26.360
My precious valuable time.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:26.760
Sorry.

01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:27.320
That game.

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:27.680
Yeah.

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:29.320
Well, you know, we all make choices.

01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:32.000
Look, that was a choice.

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.200
You were going to say something else?

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:33.560
Loki.

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:34.880
Yeah.

01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:38.960
I was going to say now the, the, the Garfield game they really need to make

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:42.000
was the, the I'm sorry, John Garfield.

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:45.960
Oh, he's like Garfield without Garfield.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:46.720
That's the game.

01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:47.880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:48.600
Yeah.

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.000
Garfield, Garfield would be fine too.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:55.800
No, but I'm talking about the, the kind of kafu like Garfield incantations

01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:58.720
where he's like this evil thing monster.

01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:00.720
So I want to see that.

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.640
How about Garfield's Garfield smash brothers, where we just have all of

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:09.880
these Garfield characters and the USA acres crew from Garfield and friends.

01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:11.560
All of that in one fighting game.

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:16.400
I remember, remember who was on us acres, who was a previous podcast

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:19.040
guest, Greg burger, also Grimlock.

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:23.160
Oh, I will have you know, though, that Garfield was the first bit of

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:26.760
DLC for nickel Nickelodeon all-star brawl.

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:27.480
Oh, hooray.

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:28.920
Isn't a smash brothers game.

01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:30.840
So yeah, thank you.

01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:32.760
I've just got tagged with that as well.

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:37.520
Bobby Blackwell suggesting Andrew Garfield could be in the game.

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:38.080
Yes.

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:41.080
Andrew Garfield as Garfield in Garfield.

01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:42.520
No, I'm sorry.

01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:43.720
The role went to Chris Pratt.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:47.880
All right.

01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:50.120
Chris Pratt is normal.

01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:50.760
He is.

01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.520
All right.

01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:01.160
For our last story tonight, I could think of nothing better for our 900th

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:06.000
episode here on air than to talk about pornography, so let's talk about

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.840
pornography and how it relates to final fantasy seven and, uh, yeah.

01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:15.640
So here's what happened in an actual lawmaker meeting for Italy.

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:20.480
So these were Italian lawmakers, uh, that were meeting on zoom as a lot of,

01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:22.040
you know, is happening throughout the world.

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:25.360
Uh, and they were funny enough talking about data transparency

01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:27.440
in political decision-making.

01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.360
And, uh, what happened is that the zoom call was introducing one of last

01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.120
year's Nobel prize winners in physics.

01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:37.640
Uh, his name was Giorgio Parisi.

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:42.960
Uh, and when the zoom call, I guess, cut over, uh, there was a 30 seconds.

01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:47.560
Of final fantasy seven hentai porn.

01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:52.640
Now the official VOD for the event, funny enough, has that moment edited out,

01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:56.200
but you know, once on the internet, always on the internet and it's

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:57.840
circulating on Twitter right now.

01:55:58.480 --> 01:55:58.800
Uh,

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:04.200
I couldn't figure out why there was a bunch of pictures going around of like

01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:09.360
the Italian flag and Tifa, and I was like, what am I missing?

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:10.720
And then, then they have the research.

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:13.480
I was like, Oh, of course.

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:14.440
Of course.

01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:20.240
Uh, and of course this, and honestly, truly at the end of the day, this

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.240
has nothing to do with video games.

01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:26.160
This is somebody horny on the internet who made something horny for horny

01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:32.600
people, and it got played at a political event by somebody, by either somebody

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:34.240
who was horny or a horny hacker.

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:35.760
One of those things happen.

01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:39.920
Um, and that's, that's what it, otherwise this really has nothing to do with final

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:43.400
fantasy seven, but our chat of course is lighting up.

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:49.200
And mentioning such facts as dark Tetsuya saying, apparently Tifa was trending on

01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:51.600
Twitter, but there wasn't any explanation.

01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:57.840
Well, now we know, uh, DJ Rama S says Tifa Lockhart equals Miss Italy 2022.

01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:00.560
Uh, Mike Def points out Tifa is Italian.

01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.800
Is, is, is she?

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:03.920
I don't, I don't, I don't know if that was ever explained because

01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:05.800
Italy doesn't exist in that universe.

01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:09.880
All right.

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:11.480
So there you go.

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:16.600
I remember the, remember I managed to find a copy of final fuck X.

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:21.840
I was just about to say, this is the same show that around, it was the pre podcast

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:22.080
year.

01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:25.000
So I would say it was probably around episode 80, 90.

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:33.080
You've like under one desk, you found a video disc, a VCD of the actual porn final

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:36.640
fuck X, which basically cosplay porn.

01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:37.640
It was horrible.

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:38.320
It was horrible.

01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:38.880
It was pretty bad.

01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:41.360
I mean, you don't watch porn for the plot.

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:45.520
But, uh, I, and that was the, I had never known before that, that the Japanese porn

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:48.440
was censored whenever there was, um, penetration going on.

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:51.160
So you would get the mosaic to show genitals.

01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:51.600
Yeah.

01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:55.560
But you would see before, before, uh, these women.

01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:57.440
Did their thing.

01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:58.920
Their costumes are great.

01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.360
Their costumes were great.

01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:01.880
They were, one was dressed as Yuna.

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:03.080
One was Lulu.

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:04.360
Uh, I think that was it.

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:07.440
I think it was just a Yuna, Yuna and a Lulu as if those are the only characters.

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.840
Costumes were amazing.

01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:11.080
The man, no costumes.

01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:12.800
They're just generic dudes.

01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:13.200
Yeah.

01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:19.000
Because this was, this was pre final fantasy 14 when we realized that, you

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.960
know, um, slutty armor is truly for everyone.

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:26.680
Uh, so maybe, maybe if they ever make a final fuck 14, who knows?

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:30.680
Uh, DJ Rama S points out typical of Japanese cosplay porn.

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:33.200
You, sir, sound like you've done your research.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:38.000
Um, SSG100Matt says, I was doing a show for work and one of the panelists

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:43.880
on the show had a porn pop-up tab with audio blasts during the, uh, show live

01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:47.200
on air, needless to say the show's archive had to be taken down.

01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:51.240
This is the exact same thing, but not the exact same thing, but the same

01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:57.640
thing as that infamous viral video of the, uh, I assure you I'm not a cat.

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:03.640
Uh, it's, it's, it's that it's some horrible setting that got left on by

01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:07.760
accident and why the setting was tuned to final fantasy seven hentai porn.

01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:11.000
Well, that is the next, that's the next great Italian

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.560
mystery, to be quite honest.

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:18.120
There'll be writing, there'll be exposes on that for years.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.160
Anyhow, let's get to the listener round table.

01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:23.200
And you know what?

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:24.680
I, I don't want to jinx it.

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:28.040
Cause the minute these words leave my mouth is when problems are going to happen.

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:30.200
However, we're in the home stretch of the show.

01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:35.320
So I feel okay saying we have dropped a total of 22 frames

01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:36.040
through the whole show.

01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:36.520
That's it.

01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.000
22 as less than a second has drawn.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:39.880
They weren't good frames.

01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:40.480
They weren't good.

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:43.640
Well, I think they were during the classic game of the week, if I remember right.

01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:45.000
So they weren't even pictures of us.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:45.680
So it's fine.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.440
It was somebody else's game.

01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:50.200
So, uh, it's, uh, that's it.

01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:52.760
We've, we've actually been able to maintain an internet connection.

01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:53.680
Knock on wood, of course.

01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:54.000
Yes.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.280
Now that I've said that goodbye.

01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:55.720
Good night.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.960
But maybe we can actually get some calls on discord tonight.

01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:00.640
We'll try it.

02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:02.840
Let's see what's the worst that can happen.

02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:08.400
So if you want to call on discord, uh, twitch.tv or excuse me, well, twitch.tv

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.040
slash vog network is where we're live.

02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:15.640
But if you want to join our discord, go to vog network.com slash discord, and, uh,

02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:20.560
we will, uh, be awaiting you in the green room and, uh, until we do that,

02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:22.000
let's check in on the mailbag.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.840
I don't remember if we have anything, but, um, I'll check in cause stuff

02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:27.440
might've accumulated while we've been having internet issues.

02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:31.760
So participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place you can send us an email.

02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.040
Do we have an emails?

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:34.560
We have none.

02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:39.400
However, I do want to, um, let you know something that I've just seen come

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:40.760
to light, thanks to our friend.

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:42.200
Okay.

02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:48.720
Um, uh, Sacramento's main arcade provider has lost a lot of arcade machines

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:51.160
due to a fire at the Sacramento drive-in.

02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:53.800
Oh, I heard about the fire over there.

02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:54.880
Yeah.

02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:00.440
Um, there is a go fund me set up, um, to raise $20,000 to help replace

02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:02.160
the machines and do repairs.

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.080
Didn't they have a DDR machine over there?

02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:04.880
I'm pretty sure they did.

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:05.400
I thought so.

02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:09.120
I think one of my friends went to see Rocky horror there and played DDR

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.960
and frankenfurter, um, cosplay, which is great.

02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:17.480
Well, I'll put the go fund me up, um, in there, but, um, but if anyone,

02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:22.840
um, Uh, is interested in contributing, I have reposted and on my own

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:26.000
Twitter at dark Sakura, thank you for that.

02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:29.400
I'm although I'm sad to hear that news, but, um, I feel bad for that.

02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:32.800
Every year they threatened to shut down and now this year it catches fire.

02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:33.240
It's sad.

02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:35.920
Although I guess the project it's, it's all the, uh, like you said, like

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:40.080
the arcade games and the, um, uh, concessions area, uh, not the

02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:41.920
projection, I guess is okay.

02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:43.640
And that's what the expensive stuff really is.

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:47.240
So, but theaters make a lot of their money on concessions.

02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:49.680
I don't know how that works out when it's a drive-in and probably

02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:52.800
people are bringing all of their own stuff to eat and drink on

02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:54.360
anyway, but still it's still.

02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:55.600
All right.

02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:59.600
Um, let's check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:03.040
No, I don't have any.

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:04.680
No, nothing.

02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:06.120
All right.

02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:08.280
Well, um, I don't see anybody in the green room.

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:10.640
I'll give it one more moment to see if anyone wants to call in.

02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:14.280
Otherwise, let me check in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:17.680
You know, when we don't get any emails, we usually talk about drag race.

02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:18.720
I'm just going to ask real quick.

02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:20.440
Cause dark soccer season 14 started.

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:21.440
I don't know if you've been watching.

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:23.040
I've seen bits and pieces.

02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:24.280
What's Oh, you have.

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:25.520
I cannot.

02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:26.160
Oh, you can't.

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:26.720
Oh, damn.

02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:32.080
Cause I was going to ask if you have a fave, but, um, there was the one

02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:34.240
who came out, I think all in polka dots.

02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:43.640
I watched, I watched the, the walk-ins on someone's channel, but I don't remember.

02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:44.640
Was that in Nigeria?

02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:46.080
Might've been Nigeria that did that.

02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:49.960
That might be, um, there's a lot of strong people this season.

02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:53.000
My favorites are dia Betty for obvious reasons.

02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:57.880
Um, and, uh, I also, uh, she's not a big pill.

02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:59.440
She's a willow pill.

02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:01.960
I just watched some of Willow pills outfits.

02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:02.960
Just very glamorous.

02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:03.320
Yeah.

02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:04.360
I think Willow pills.

02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:05.440
Fantastic.

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:09.400
I honestly, so, uh, the, I need a way to watch, so I'm going to try to figure

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:13.720
something out if you can't see, if you can't watch anything else from drag race

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:19.440
this season, watch, cause they, they, they Jack the thing from all stars where they

02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:24.560
do, uh, um, talent show in the first episode, watch Willow pills talent show.

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:25.960
It's amazing.

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:26.800
Okay.

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:31.040
By the way, apparently Brittany covered, you ought to know and nailed it.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Oh, like on her Instagram.

02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:37.600
Um, I think on like a live stage.

02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:39.000
Oh, interesting.

02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:42.880
But Brittany hasn't, I mean, it has to be an old clip cause Brittany hasn't done any

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:47.040
performing since the whole, it was reposted by Marina from Marina and the diamonds.

02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:48.640
It's it's gotta be old though.

02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:51.080
Cause Brittany hasn't performed since the whole, um, executive

02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:52.360
ship and that whole thing.

02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:53.560
She didn't want to perform.

02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:56.640
She was doing, I don't know how old it is, but I never knew this clip

02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:57.960
existed and it's pretty awesome.

02:03:58.240 --> 02:03:58.440
Yeah.

02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:01.760
I mean, old stuff resurfaces sometimes it still doesn't make it any less great.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.560
Um, Kelly Clarkson recently did a hands clean by Alanis.

02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:05.840
It was great.

02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:07.000
Kelly Clarkson.

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:08.960
I like, she's one of those people.

02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:11.080
It's like, I always forget how fucking good she is.

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:13.040
And then like one of her covers will just float it.

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:16.240
Cause she did, she has a cover literally every day because of her talk show.

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:21.080
And one of her covers comes across my Twitter feed and I'm like, God, that woman

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:26.120
is a gift, you know, not that I, I don't want to speak anything negative about

02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:31.960
Dolly Parton, put her in a bubble, protect her, save her, but I do feel like Kelly

02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:36.040
Clarkson is sort of being groomed for that role when Dolly Parton inevitably

02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:37.680
leaves that leaves this earth.

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:38.160
So.

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:39.240
There is that.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:40.400
All right.

02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:42.520
But not for like 25 years.

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:43.000
Okay.

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:46.200
If, uh, we could, Dolly needs 25 more years.

02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:46.880
Yeah.

02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:48.200
You need to talk to share.

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:49.080
Okay.

02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:52.800
And do whatever she taught to Keith Richards.

02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.160
Talk to Keith Richards.

02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:58.600
That's what Betty should have done was taught to Keith Richards.

02:04:58.600 --> 02:04:59.320
I'm just saying.

02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:00.240
All right.

02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:03.160
Uh, let's, we actually have a call in the green room.

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:04.560
I want to get to this cause I have a feeling.

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:06.320
I know what this person is calling in to talk about and I

02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:07.200
definitely want to hear it.

02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:11.280
So let's get to it and welcome our caller onto the show.

02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:12.960
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:13.440
Who's this?

02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:15.240
Hey everyone.

02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:17.080
It's a show under Matt.

02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:17.680
Hey, Matt.

02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:18.560
It's good to hear from you.

02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:21.160
If you want to, oh, it's just about to say you can turn on your cam if you want,

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:24.960
but some, some people call in and are like, you don't want me to turn my cam on.

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:25.280
Trust me.

02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:25.560
Okay.

02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:25.880
Don't.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:26.320
All right.

02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:27.800
Hey, good to see you, Matt.

02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:31.320
Well, now, now I got to try to concentrate, not to look at the TV.

02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:32.360
I know.

02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:33.040
I know.

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:34.080
Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:37.960
So, um, this is a little delayed, but I wanted to call in and talk

02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:39.640
a little bit about a mag fest.

02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:40.880
Well, the delay is our fault.

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:41.800
Not yours, please.

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.120
I want to hear about mag fest.

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:43.600
How was it?

02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:49.240
Um, so, well, first off, I wanted to say that I am, uh, I came back, uh,

02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:52.840
fine and safe, I didn't get sick or anything like that first.

02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:56.280
First off, who is that cute little fuzz ball behind you?

02:05:57.240 --> 02:05:59.160
Oh, he's awake.

02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:01.160
Um, his name is Finn.

02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:03.120
It's, uh, it's our pop.

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:03.840
Okay.

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:07.240
Uh, um, what are you French bulldog?

02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:10.120
Uh, Boston terrier, Boston terrier.

02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:12.720
Sorry to the facial shape.

02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:16.800
Sorry to the podcast listeners who can't see the dog, but, um, also

02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.080
not sorry, because I'm always going to ask about the cute animals.

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:19.440
Sorry.

02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:24.640
But also, um, he is, uh, he is, he is on the subscriber chat.

02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:31.120
I did post a picture a while back, but regardless, um, uh, so yeah, mag fest.

02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:38.640
Um, uh, so mag fest was obviously very different this year, um, because

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:45.720
of all the COVID stuff and, um, they, and it did have a very good time.

02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:47.520
They did, they did make a lot of changes.

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:56.320
Um, it did require a vaccination and, uh, everybody to be masked at all times.

02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:02.080
And that ended up being very good because I think, uh, I think other

02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:05.920
conventions that have had similar requirements, they've all kind of

02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:11.960
worked out and every, and it seems like everybody did, uh, did follow the rules.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.240
And that was the case of mag fest as well.

02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:14.720
Yeah.

02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:16.760
And I think it's important to point out, you know, I've talked about

02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:20.800
dragon con and how great that felt, even if it was a little weird, but

02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:24.480
dragon con was also kind of like not, I mean, I guess it was kind of during

02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:28.040
the Delta variant and all that, but you guys had to deal with the mag fest,

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:31.960
had to deal with the Omicron variant and how that has been really growing.

02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:36.080
And so like, you know, to be fair, that wasn't a concern at dragon con,

02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:39.200
whereas, you know, you had this new, highly contagious variant.

02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:42.080
And I think that made a lot of people question like, Oh shit, is

02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:43.440
mag fest even going to happen?

02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:47.320
Although now, you know, no, no company's going to get out of the

02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:48.800
legal necessities to put that on.

02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:52.480
So I was kind of curious, like what precautions they were going to taste.

02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:54.680
They actually required full vaccination and mass.

02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:55.160
That's good.

02:07:56.120 --> 02:07:56.440
Yeah.

02:07:56.520 --> 02:08:01.280
And, um, and even, and even me, like I like with everything that was going

02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:07.480
on, I kind of like, I didn't decide on going finally until like the day before.

02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:11.000
Cause it was just like, things were just getting worse.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:16.960
Maryland, the state of Maryland where mag fest is, they had a, did a state of

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:20.120
emergency because cases were just so high in the DC area.

02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:27.480
So, um, I just kind of decided that, you know, I'm going to do all the right things.

02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:28.320
I'm going to follow the rules.

02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:29.360
I'm going to wear a mask.

02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:33.880
I even even wore a face shield and that all seemed to work out.

02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:40.440
Um, but, um, I just decided that, you know, like I needed to kind of just get

02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:48.120
out of the house, do something and this felt, you know, I felt like the

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:52.080
precautions and everything were pretty safe and going there, everything.

02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:55.880
Um, there was a lot less capacity.

02:08:56.280 --> 02:09:00.920
Um, typically make best gets about 22,000 attendees.

02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:07.720
Um, this year they had just under 11, uh, about half that a little less than half of that.

02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:15.640
And, um, and, but see, I love dragon con at half capacity, even if it's probably not

02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:20.600
sustainable, that I loved it at half capacity and, and, you know, and, and

02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:24.440
magfest was about the same, cause it just, it felt a lot more kind of open.

02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:28.640
And, um, yeah, there were fewer, you know, machines, there were fewer

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:33.720
because in the arcade area, you know, you could just play any, the kind of the nice

02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:40.040
thing about magfest is that it kind of runs, um, 24 hours through the, through

02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:41.600
the whole, through the whole weekend.

02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:44.600
Um, they had to change that because of staff issues.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.880
It didn't have people that didn't have enough volunteers to watch the arcade

02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:51.200
room and expo hall for the whole time.

02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:54.080
So they had to close from 4 AM to 8 AM.

02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:57.840
Um, but you know, there were fewer machines.

02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:01.320
There were, there were fewer guests, a lot of guests dropped out at the last minute.

02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:06.760
Um, and, but they did do a lot of like nice virtual things.

02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:15.440
They, um, they did some VR chat stuff where people could watch parts of the

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:17.240
parts of the show through VR chat.

02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:21.600
And, uh, different concerts and everything like that.

02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:26.880
So, and there were like some stations where you can, uh, see people in VR chat.

02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:31.800
Um, and interact and interact with those people.

02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:33.320
Um, that's neat.

02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:38.440
And they had, and apparently there's a whole, there was a whole, like a

02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:41.080
conventions that are metaverse.

02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:45.640
People can go around, they can, and there's been like a little, like a

02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:49.480
in-joke at magfest with, uh, Danny DeVito shrine.

02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:50.200
Oh yeah.

02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:51.000
Yeah.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:51.600
I saw that.

02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:52.400
I saw that.

02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:53.400
And the Betty white shrine.

02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:56.680
Yeah, they have a, they, they, and the Betty white shrine was,

02:10:56.680 --> 02:10:58.240
that was the new thing this year.

02:10:58.320 --> 02:10:58.480
Yeah.

02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:03.480
So, um, but everybody, for the most part, everybody that I saw and every

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.840
that I kind of interacted with, everybody followed the rules.

02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:10.240
Everybody wore a mask, everybody kind of social distance.

02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:14.640
I kind of did, I kind of had to change my, the way that I kind of do.

02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:18.920
Magfest, uh, typically I have, we have a bunch of friends come.

02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:22.800
Um, very few of my friends came for obvious reasons.

02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:25.400
Um, and typically we'd go to the concerts.

02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:27.120
I didn't really attend to the concerts.

02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:32.280
And, um, I didn't really attend some, some of their bigger panels.

02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:36.240
It's just kind of like I poke, I would poke my head and see how busy and just

02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:40.320
kind of, kind of get the feeling before I kind of like committed to like going

02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:44.280
into some things, um, just because just like,

02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:49.080
just wanted to kind of just be as safe as possible. But even like,

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:52.640
just like with that, I kind of still had a good time.

02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:55.160
And, um,

02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:00.200
I think that there's definitely a space for conventions even in this era of

02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:07.200
COVID and everything that I think that if shows do the right things and every,

02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:11.200
and all the attendees do all the right things that I think that it can still,

02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:14.320
that, uh, conventions can still work in this era.

02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:18.200
Yeah. Um, you know, I want to, it just goes to show, you know, cause I,

02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:22.520
and I haven't heard of Magfest having been a super spreader event.

02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:26.080
Um, and I know with Dragon Con, a lot of people were screaming beforehand,

02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:29.920
it's going to be a super spreader event and it does go to show that while yes,

02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:34.240
there is an increased risk with that. You are putting yourself at risk. Um,

02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:37.840
if you follow the rules, take precautions, you know,

02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:38.480
and in addition to,

02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:42.360
I know you isolated for a few days after the fact as did I after Dragon Con,

02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:43.880
you know, and then get tested and all that stuff.

02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:48.240
It's like you can kind of make these things work. Um, and you know,

02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.680
Omicron won't be around forever and hopefully not too much longer.

02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:55.120
And maybe when we get more endemic, maybe we'll still have, I don't know,

02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:57.200
masks and vaccines at conventions,

02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:00.680
but maybe we'll be able to have a lot of people back and all that. Um,

02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:03.600
I still think it would be really good to have a lot of people back and all that.

02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:04.920
I still think it would be really cool.

02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:06.360
Some of these things kind of stick around.

02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:10.280
Like you were talking about the VR chat and the metaverse and allowing people

02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:13.600
who maybe like physically can't get to magfest,

02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:18.000
even if COVID wasn't a thing, uh, allow them to still participate.

02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:19.400
I think that's kind of cool.

02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:23.520
So I hope that they do kind of keep some of those things that they've had to

02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:26.960
think about because of COVID involved, um, in the future,

02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:31.720
just like Dragon Con and Dragon Con TV and expanding that and allowing more home

02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:34.640
access in that regard and their discord server and all that stuff. You know,

02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:37.960
a lot of conventions are finding sort of their niches and their ways to sort of

02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:41.880
expand in the era of COVID. And I think that's a really, really good thing. So.

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:46.120
Yeah. And, uh, and just one more thing that I forgot to mention that magfest did,

02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:48.480
that was kind of, that I thought it was nice. Some people aren't,

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:52.800
aren't really too crazy about it. Um, that, um, magfest,

02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:56.680
they kind of did like their own little contract tracing, um,

02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:59.920
thing, uh, afterwards, um,

02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:03.440
everybody who got tested and came back positive,

02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:07.560
they were encouraged to fill out a Google spreadsheet of

02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:11.560
where they went, when did they get tested and,

02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:13.640
and magfest published all the,

02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:18.280
all the reports and everything of where these people went. Um,

02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:21.400
they didn't say, you know, like they, everything was anonymous, but, um,

02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:25.000
they said like, okay, if you were at this panel, uh,

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:29.960
one person was tested positive there. So if, so if you were at this panel,

02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:34.000
maybe you should get yourself tested and they published the whole list.

02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:38.040
Something unofficial like that kind of happened with dragon con and we actually

02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:42.680
found out one of the panelists on one of the tracks I was on was positive for

02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:46.240
COVID and went to dragon con annoyingly with COVID. Um,

02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:49.920
but the good news was nobody got nobody like everybody on the track,

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:51.880
at least all the panelists that talk on this discord,

02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:55.920
all of them got lab tested, including myself. None of us were positive.

02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:00.760
So that was like, you know, obviously it sucks. Someone had COVID, but, um,

02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:05.120
that was really refreshing. So, yeah. And yeah, no.

02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:06.880
And I think the numbers,

02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:11.440
so they published the numbers of like how many people like self-reported and

02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:16.360
they said about 187 people tested positive afterwards out of, you know,

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:21.480
well, but out of 11,000, that's actually, you know, and you don't know if

02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:25.040
reported. So then some of them, so the members might be more, but.

02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:28.960
But also they maybe didn't get it at magfest because I know when I went to

02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:32.880
dragon, if I got COVID in Atlanta, it was on public transit.

02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:35.520
It was not a dragon con. Like I, like it was,

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:39.720
there's other elements to getting to the con that I think have to be considered

02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:40.560
as well.

02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:44.760
Of course. Yeah. So, um, you know,

02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:46.320
like I did all the right things.

02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:50.600
I took a week off and kind of just isolated. I mean, I work from home anyways,

02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:54.680
but it's, um, I did all the right things. I didn't go out and kill my family.

02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:58.520
Like a lot of people on the internet claim that anyone who attended magfest was

02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:01.560
going to do now. It just, um,

02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:08.040
I mean, I think, I think that you,

02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:11.880
you just have to assume that everybody who wants to do something public

02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:16.760
has best intent and that they're going to do the right thing. I think that's,

02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:17.600
you just have to,

02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:22.720
you just have to just assume that anyone will kind of do that because not

02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:26.240
everybody is like a, you know, spring break party boat,

02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:29.000
everybody not vaccinated and all that stuff.

02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:33.480
It's a lot of people follow the rules and do all the right things. So.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:35.640
Was it like, you know,

02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:40.040
going back to kind of the point of magfest and you know you willing to put

02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:44.840
yourself at the risk and all that stuff. What was it nice to just have a taste?

02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:48.920
What was it about magfest that made you go, you know what,

02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:50.320
I'm really glad I did this.

02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:55.800
Um, I think being, you know, being, being stuck at home for so long,

02:16:55.800 --> 02:17:00.400
just just like I kind of needed to get out, you know, and, um,

02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:02.120
just kind of just like,

02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:06.520
it was just a little taste of just kind of like this is what things were like

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:07.040
before.

02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:12.040
And like I was able to take a semi real vacation in a ways for all this.

02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:17.000
So it, it's just a, for just mentally, it's just like, it's just,

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.440
it's nice to kind of just do something even though like there's restrictions

02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:26.200
and all that stuff. I think it's just nice to just kind of just have some joy,

02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:27.480
do, do something fun.

02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:29.960
All right. Well,

02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:32.560
thank you for calling in tonight and talking about your magfest experience.

02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:36.800
I appreciate it. And, uh, let's all, and of course, and of course,

02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:41.520
happy 900th episodes. Thank you. Thank you.

02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:42.880
I appreciate that.

02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:46.400
Couldn't have done it without the support of you and so many other people that

02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:48.320
participate with our show for a long time.

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:51.040
I know you haven't been here since episode one, but let's be honest.

02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:52.480
It kind of feels like it. I was,

02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:55.320
I think I came in in the red of double digits there, but that's,

02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:58.960
that is pretty fucking impressive, honestly. And you know what? I don't care.

02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:03.160
I don't care if episode three was your first show or if episode 900 is your

02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:07.760
first show. Welcome. Thank you. I hope you, I hope you'd enjoy,

02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:10.800
hope you enjoy being a part of this because we really enjoy having everybody

02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:13.600
here. We certainly have. And, uh, of course,

02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:16.800
congratulations in the house for you and Alan.

02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:22.160
And I hope it's a really an experience and, uh,

02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:23.880
don't drive yourself nuts with the move.

02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:29.480
We hired movers already. So that part is now it's just packet. No,

02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:31.200
cause when we saved the money, I knew,

02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:36.160
I said we are saving like an extra dollars to

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:40.360
earmark movers. Cause we're not like we're at that age where pizza and beer

02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:45.080
doesn't work anymore to get movers. It worked on me, which is all.

02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:48.640
That's very sweet. Thank you. Um, maybe you can help us sort through some,

02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:49.120
you know what?

02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:52.800
I need somebody to help set up my office with all these cute little mini arcade

02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:56.200
cabs and things like that. So maybe I'll, I'll ask you to help me with that.

02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:58.800
But it is really cute. I will say this, um, because you know,

02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:02.200
I do this stuff with Rocky horror here locally and the horror film festival and

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:03.880
I have, you know, different friend groups through that.

02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:07.600
And there are a lot of younger folks like in their twenties and so forth.

02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:11.080
And it is very cute because so many of them are offering to help.

02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:13.640
Like if you need anything with moving, let me know. And I'm like, Oh God,

02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:17.920
I love you so much. But trust me, when you get, when you get to 40,

02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:20.680
your forties, you're like, I'm just paying for movers to do it.

02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:22.840
And it'll be done in three hours.

02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:29.240
When we moved into this house. Um, cause keep in mind, I,

02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:33.080
I think we were just in our very late thirties when we did it,

02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:37.560
but we did everything ourselves. But you know,

02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:39.200
with the pinball crowd,

02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:44.000
we know so many people who have like dollies

02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:47.800
and lifting jacks and all kinds of stuff.

02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:48.680
That's true.

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:53.920
The, for us, it was like, we'll just, we'll just have our friends. I mean,

02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:56.280
and I moved a lot of stuff at my Fiat,

02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:59.120
a lot of stuff fit in that Fiat.

02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:04.880
Pod culture is asking, will Mr. Smoosh get his own room? No,

02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:07.160
we're taking his room away, the guest room.

02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:12.040
So that Alan and I can have separate offices so that hopefully on our gigabit

02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:15.280
fiber, we can both stream at the same time.

02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:18.880
That is what we're hoping for the new setup.

02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:23.920
Mr. Smoosh will get to share his new room and his potty box, uh,

02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:28.560
with the washer and dryer in a facility. Cause now in newer houses,

02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:29.760
you don't really put it in the garage.

02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:32.720
They actually have like a laundry room in the house. So that's what we have. So,

02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:36.880
um, that's where Mr. Smoosh's, uh, stuff can go as far as I'm concerned.

02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:39.400
But I'm excited for him to lose a little weight, uh,

02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:41.640
hoofing it up and down the stairs cause the new house has stairs.

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:43.320
So he has to hoof it up and down the stairs.

02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:48.040
It didn't help Shermy much. Remember? Oh, oh really? Oh yeah. Oh well.

02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:51.000
But, but, um, uh,

02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:54.440
DJ Rama asked if Mr. Smoosh got the arcade machine.

02:20:55.920 --> 02:21:00.960
I, I said that to Dan and he reminded me of when Shermy

02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:05.640
lived inside of a pole position. Um, remember that? Yes, I do.

02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:09.160
I do. And the answer to Rama's question, uh, no, um,

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:12.560
because our policy right now is less stuff, not more.

02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:16.360
So we're not taking on any new stuff until after the move is done.

02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:21.520
But if those machines are, so what he sent me for those, it was, um,

02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:23.760
it's a cat scratcher, like a wooden scratch,

02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:26.520
but it looks like an arcade machine and it's really fucking cute.

02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:29.280
It's like a kitty arcade machine. And so, um,

02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:32.720
if the move and they're still available after the move,

02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:33.880
I will happily get them one.

02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:37.400
Here's something else I need everybody to consider. And, um,

02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:41.800
this will not be a surprise anyway. So right now we only have Mr. Smoosh,

02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:46.240
one cat because our landlord only allows one pet. Guess what else happened?

02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:48.320
Change. Guess what else changes in February?

02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:52.880
We don't have a landlord anymore. So, so y'all,

02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:55.120
y'all can read between the lines of what I'm getting at.

02:21:55.320 --> 02:21:58.360
So don't think about just Mr. Smoosh in this picture.

02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:02.000
Really careful and see if Mr. Smoosh is okay with other cats.

02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:06.160
Yeah. We need to find something where it's acceptable for us to do a test run.

02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:10.080
And Alan and I have to be able to accept the fact that it might not work.

02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:12.720
And that's the whole reason we ended up independent fosters.

02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:14.640
And that's the whole reason we ended up with Mr.

02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:19.360
Smoosh in the first place is that the, the person that found Mr. Smoosh, uh,

02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:20.640
the friend of a friend that,

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:23.560
that realized Smoosh had been abandoned and that something had happened to his

02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:26.360
eye and all that stuff, uh, tried to take him in,

02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:28.720
but the other cat was not having them.

02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:33.240
So she knew she had to find a different, um, uh,

02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:37.560
family and we were ready and available. Anyway, uh,

02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:38.800
Quest Buster says-

02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:43.360
Well there's always going to be an introductory period. A lot of, uh,

02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:47.760
really good things to do to, to bring a cat in is that when you bring in a new

02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:51.000
cat, you do need to give them about a week of quarantine.

02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:55.040
More like if they're young cats. Um,

02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:59.880
and then a thing that you can do is start feeding them separately and then

02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:03.200
slowly move their bowls together and feed them at the same time.

02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:04.200
Yeah.

02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:08.600
And then that helps with, I've, I fostered a little bit in my time.

02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:10.000
I've introduced a kitten.

02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:14.240
You should have seen when I brought my cat Ranma home when old man was alive,

02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:16.920
when I lived in Alabama, that was an adventure.

02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:18.680
Um,

02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:22.040
Dr. Tzuyu says my wife's cat is always rubbing up against my Ms.

02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:24.320
Pac-Man one up. I think she thinks it's hers now.

02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:27.040
There's something about those machines that cats love.

02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:30.040
When I turn on the burger time machine, if smooshes around,

02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:33.680
his eyes light the fuck up and like,

02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:35.480
he wants to get right up in that screen.

02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:40.400
It's something about the lights and the noise. He's so into it. Yeah.

02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:41.240
It's wild.

02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:42.320
Midna's completely indifferent.

02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:43.480
Yeah.

02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:45.040
All right. Sorry. Sorry, Matt.

02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:48.040
I know you're calling with your dog and here we are having cat talk.

02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:50.400
All right.

02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:51.240
Hi cutie.

02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:53.160
He's actually, he's actually terrified of cats.

02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:54.080
Oh, that's cute.

02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:55.400
Oh, poppers.

02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:56.120
I love that.

02:23:56.120 --> 02:23:57.360
He's terrified of cats.

02:23:57.360 --> 02:24:02.040
He thinks they're dogs, but that they, he thinks that they're dogs, but you know,

02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:05.680
they just being off put, off putting and, uh, don't want to play with them.

02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:08.280
Oh, Midna loves dogs.

02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:09.320
And he, she liked one too.

02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:11.120
And one too was a big,

02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:13.920
scary pit bull who was really a little puppy in her heart.

02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:16.720
All right, Matt, I'm going to let you go,

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:18.800
but thank you so much for calling into the show tonight and talking about

02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:21.800
MagFest. It's really nice to hear that, uh, the conventions are,

02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:23.200
are making it work. Uh,

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:25.240
and maybe we can have a taste of that again,

02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:27.960
especially as we look to things like TwitchCon and you know,

02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:29.920
all the stuff we want to go to in 2022.

02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:32.440
So, all right.

02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:33.960
Yeah, you too.

02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:34.640
Take care of my friend.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:35.360
Bye bye.

02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:37.240
All right.

02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:40.560
Always good to hear from our folks that are out there listening.

02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:43.680
I think that was the only call I saw in the green room.

02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:44.720
So I think with that,

02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:48.120
we will probably go to wrapping up our show tonight.

02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:51.200
Thanks again as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:52.040
And as I said,

02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:56.240
whether it's your first time listening or your 899th time listening,

02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:59.440
thank you so much for being a part of the show tonight. Uh,

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:04.360
we'll be back in seven days for episode number 901 and maybe the

02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:07.560
internet issues are a thing of the past. Fingers crossed, toes crossed.

02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:09.240
There's one other thing I forgot to mention.

02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:10.160
All right.

02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:14.360
This today marks, um,

02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:18.400
my anniversary of living in California now officially more than half of my life.

02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:20.520
Oh, well, congrats.

02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:21.880
Thank you.

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:24.720
I think we can officially say you're a California girl.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.640
The day, uh, Dan and I met in person.

02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:29.600
Oh, wowee.

02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:30.360
Oh, that's amazing.

02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:31.680
So you've known Dan half your life.

02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:34.520
More than, well, more.

02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:36.720
Well, yeah, more than half in person, more than half.

02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:38.080
Wow. Wow.

02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:40.080
Congrats. Mazel tov.

02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:40.760
All right.

02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:41.320
Thank you.

02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:44.320
Um, so, OK, uh, where was I?

02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:46.360
Yes, thank you for listening.

02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:48.440
And if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:50.200
tell a friend or two about the show.

02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:53.000
Even if you hated the show and yet somehow still made it to the end.

02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:56.040
Tell somebody you think might actually like this stuff.

02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:00.800
Make a YouTube about this show and everything that's wrong with it.

02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:03.120
And Logie will watch it.

02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:05.200
No, seriously, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:07.920
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:11.640
But we want more voices here to get those thoughts and opinions out on the air.

02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:17.040
If you want to join our discord, we'd love to have you vognetwork.com

02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:22.240
slash discord, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify,

02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:24.680
wherever it is you actually Spotify does have reviews now.

02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:27.160
So those actually do work on there.

02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:29.920
So please, if you haven't yet rated us there, please consider it.

02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:32.320
And all of that goes an awful long way.

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.480
And again, just thank you for being a part of it.

02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:37.400
We really couldn't have got to episode 900 without your help.

02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:41.000
And here's here's hoping for a thousand.

02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:45.160
That's it. I can't think of anything else to say.

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:47.600
So let's get to the final thoughts.

02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:51.280
Dark Sakura, I know you're probably going to go off and start your killing

02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:53.720
and dead by daylight, so I'll let you go first with your final thought.

02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:56.840
Um, I'm going to try to make it a full stream.

02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:00.440
I'm still feeling a little bit under the weather, but we'll try.

02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:03.040
I'm on my second round of antibiotics. Can you believe it?

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:04.960
Oh, boy. Feel better.

02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:06.840
Thank you. Later, caters.

02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:09.160
At least at least it wasn't COVID.

02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:11.000
At least it was a COVID.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.520
I know it's like the saying of the year.

02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:14.560
All right. Take care of Dark Sakura.

02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:16.360
All right. Bye, everybody.

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:19.240
Loki, I'll go to you for your final thought.

02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:21.720
My final thought is that I'm

02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:25.880
going to try to put out another episode here pretty soon of my YouTube series.

02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:28.360
I'm still working on a very large builder right now.

02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:30.760
It's a starter base.

02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:32.760
It's enormous.

02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:35.160
So hopefully they'll be coming soon.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.840
And my final thought is I am fucking gagged that we made it

02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:41.800
through the whole episode without an Internet outage

02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:43.800
when I was sitting here at the very beginning going,

02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:46.680
well, it's probably going to be a month before we can fix.

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:52.120
Of course, if I if I say it, the opposite will be willed into existence.

02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:55.680
But you know what? I'll take it because I love having you folks here live

02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:58.240
and not having to deal with all those shitty hiccups.

02:27:58.240 --> 02:27:59.880
So thank you.

02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:02.960
And hey, if my Internet can hold out, maybe I can squeeze in

02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:04.480
a few more personal streams.

02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:07.880
I'm probably not going to be streaming a lot a lot until I get to the new place.

02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:12.000
I've been wanting to say for so long that, like Alan

02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:14.800
and I have these ways that we're going to fix some of our problems.

02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:17.840
And now I can find out kind of openly talk about it, which is great.

02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:21.120
But it will probably slow down my personal streaming for a little bit.

02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:24.360
But in February, it's on. It is on.

02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:27.240
All right. That is going to do it.

02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:30.720
Thank you again for listening to our show. Have fun gaming.

02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:34.440
Everyone games and should have fun playing some games.

02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:37.040
Make this a welcoming space for everyone.

02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:41.080
We'll see you in seven days to do this all again with episode number nine hundred

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:43.040
and one. I hope that sounds good.

02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:44.920
Have a great week, everybody. Good night.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.800
