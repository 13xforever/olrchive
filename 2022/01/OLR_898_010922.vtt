00:00.000 --> 00:09.840
Don't talk about NFTs, don't talk about NFTs, don't talk about NFTs!

00:09.840 --> 00:15.840
This week, Gamestop, the once video game turned collectible turned toy turned NFT market po...

00:15.840 --> 00:19.840
Classic Orange Lounge radio fans were delighted to hear that Konami has revealed a Castlevania

00:19.840 --> 00:22.480
and a... for crying out loud.

00:22.480 --> 00:28.680
Sega says they won't release something that is an empty cash grab, like NFTs!

00:28.680 --> 00:32.200
And now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about NFTs!

00:32.200 --> 00:36.320
And the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has

00:36.320 --> 00:37.320
a voice.

00:37.320 --> 00:46.720
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:46.720 --> 00:49.480
where every gamer has a voice.

00:49.480 --> 00:56.480
It is Orange Lounge Radio back with you once again for the first show of our 20th broadcast

00:56.480 --> 00:57.480
year.

00:57.520 --> 01:06.360
2002 episode one to today, episode 898 for this January 9th of 2022.

01:06.360 --> 01:10.760
I am Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my co-hosts who I actually I'm going to introduce out

01:10.760 --> 01:12.160
of order tonight a little bit.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.160
I'll start tonight.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.160
Say hello to Techmaster Loki, everybody.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.160
Hello.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.160
Hi.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.840
Welcome back as the case may be.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.680
Yeah, thanks.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.080
So be here and not where I was.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.080
Yes.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.880
All I told the listeners was that you were in the ER, but I see you're up.

01:29.880 --> 01:30.880
You're smiling.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.600
You even got DuckTales playing behind you.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.920
So everything seems like it's all good, right?

01:35.920 --> 01:38.280
Yeah, it's all right.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.840
I mean, considering.

01:39.840 --> 01:48.080
So yeah, so last weekend I had like, it felt like a sore muscle, but it wasn't going away.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.640
And I thought it was my appendix.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.760
And so I went into the ER and you know, the ER is super slow.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.560
So we did all that.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.760
It ended up not being my appendix instead.

01:58.760 --> 02:03.640
It is a wonderful kidney stone, the gift of 2022.

02:03.640 --> 02:07.440
So yeah, that that's fun.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.440
All right.

02:08.440 --> 02:13.520
Well, let me also introduce Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.120
We held down the fort last week with a no LR.

02:16.120 --> 02:21.680
So there was no podcast because Dark Sakura and I kind of did a chatty like screw around.

02:21.680 --> 02:22.680
We didn't really talk about games.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.240
We talked about whatever we wanted.

02:24.240 --> 02:29.000
However, we were hypothesizing what's wrong with Loki before I got the text message from

02:29.000 --> 02:30.640
you Loki, like halfway through.

02:30.640 --> 02:34.240
But in the beginning we were hypothesizing what's wrong with Loki and a high five Dark

02:34.240 --> 02:35.240
Sakura.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.880
I think we had landed on kidney stone.

02:36.880 --> 02:44.520
So I think I, I, I, my, my exact phrase was, I hope that's what it is out of all the things

02:44.520 --> 02:45.520
that could be.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.520
Yes.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
Yeah.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.400
I think, I think it was like that or appendix would be the like easiest to like the most

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
routine one.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.600
Neither are fun.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.600
Yeah.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.600
Neither are neither are fun.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.600
Don't get me wrong.

02:55.600 --> 03:00.520
And I'm sure Loki can attest was not fun, but, uh, you know, the appendix actually does

03:00.520 --> 03:01.520
serve a purpose.

03:01.520 --> 03:02.520
I see.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.780
I always thought it didn't like, it was supposed to be something like tied to like uncooked

03:05.780 --> 03:07.440
meat and our ancestors or something.

03:07.440 --> 03:16.920
It was theorized as a, as a, um, a vestigial organ, but action, but oh, oh, yeah, I, okay.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.480
It wasn't just me that lost her.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.480
Sorry.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.800
You just like an internet hiccup.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.400
Like when is, no, I don't think it was like a stupid audio rig for some reason.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.840
This is even before I put, I called loop back.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.760
Oh, I thought it was like a zoom zoom call gone bad.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.920
It's been doing this weird thing with my headphones.

03:32.920 --> 03:41.040
I'll need to fuck with it, but, um, but at any rate, um, it, uh, it houses good bacteria,

03:41.040 --> 03:45.480
especially after periods of gastroenteritis or any sort of digestive issue.

03:45.480 --> 03:52.520
Um, and on top of that, it provides a lot of the immune function in infants.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.520
Hmm.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.520
Interesting.

03:54.520 --> 03:58.800
I read the whole entire study on it and it came up recently in another conversation.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.800
All right.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.760
And dark soccer is bringing, been educating us on facts like that for the last 20 years

04:04.760 --> 04:08.160
in our video game, random shit.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.160
I do it too.

04:09.160 --> 04:13.040
Uh, I like to absorb celebrity stuff, so I've got to say this at the top of the show, we'll

04:13.040 --> 04:14.240
get into our kickoff topic here.

04:14.240 --> 04:19.840
I watched the walk-in, the walk, the walk-ins cause, uh, someone played, was it Nick that

04:19.840 --> 04:21.880
played it on his channel?

04:21.880 --> 04:27.960
I was someone, someone did the, uh, the, uh, workroom walk-ins.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.960
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

04:29.960 --> 04:30.960
I don't want to talk about drag race.

04:30.960 --> 04:31.960
No, no, no.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.680
I want to talk about, I was just going to say, but, but I already have a favorite.

04:34.680 --> 04:35.680
Okay.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.120
But we'll talk about that if we have no emails, but I want to say, I want to, um, we do have,

04:39.120 --> 04:40.440
I want to mention this at the time.

04:40.440 --> 04:44.160
So another thing we talked about on the no LR and you guys can go back and watch it.

04:44.160 --> 04:48.800
I did, um, clip it for, um, the Twitch TV subscriber archives, but I do want to stress

04:48.800 --> 04:51.720
because I don't want the podcasters to feel like they're missing out on something.

04:51.720 --> 04:52.720
It got really off topic.

04:52.720 --> 04:56.200
We were talking about like COVID and all this stuff that like has nothing to do with gaming

04:56.200 --> 04:58.780
and there were like two headlines from last week.

04:58.780 --> 05:01.000
So there was hardly anything to cover anyway.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.880
But one thing we got into is we were talking about the death of Betty white, because you

05:04.880 --> 05:09.200
know, our listeners know that we love Betty white and kind of expected us to get into

05:09.200 --> 05:10.200
that at some point.

05:10.200 --> 05:15.600
We had to talk about it and that led to dark soccer, kind of looking at a list of, well,

05:15.600 --> 05:16.600
who else is close?

05:16.600 --> 05:19.320
Cause Betty white was 99, right?

05:19.320 --> 05:22.920
And as you were going through this list of 90 year old celebrities, one of the names

05:22.920 --> 05:29.880
you came across was Sidney Poitier and then unfortunately this last week, there we go.

05:29.880 --> 05:33.200
Um, one name that, well, guess who died today?

05:33.200 --> 05:34.200
I heard.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.200
Yeah.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
This is so, this is so funny.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.600
Uh, I, I got up from a pre-show nap.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.640
I got up from a pre-show nap as I usually do.

05:42.640 --> 05:46.280
And I walk into the kitchen and Alan goes, Oh my God, did you hear who died?

05:46.280 --> 05:51.560
And I was like, honey, the first thing I do whenever I wake up from it is I check Twitter.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.560
Yes.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.560
I know Bob Saget died.

05:53.560 --> 05:58.080
Um, but that, that was certainly not on the list, uh, because he was only 65.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.080
That's that's very young and very surprising.

06:00.080 --> 06:04.880
And I think a lot of people are kind of feeling that whole, like, what, like, was he murdered

06:04.880 --> 06:06.800
like on tour and yeah, no.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.300
And for the record, he was not murdered.

06:08.300 --> 06:14.020
And I, I, there was a, a tweet from a verified police thing in Florida that says no foul

06:14.020 --> 06:15.940
play, no drugs.

06:15.940 --> 06:23.100
So this appears to be the man probably, I, again, I don't like overworked, overstressed,

06:23.100 --> 06:25.980
overworked, bad living, a heart attack probably.

06:25.980 --> 06:26.980
Who knows?

06:26.980 --> 06:31.760
I don't mean to be disrespectful by making things up, but sometimes shit happens.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.160
People spontaneously combust.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.820
It just, things happen.

06:35.340 --> 06:39.380
Um, so yeah, and a lot of people are saying he tweeted last night.

06:39.380 --> 06:40.380
Yeah.

06:40.380 --> 06:41.740
It just shows every day.

06:41.740 --> 06:43.540
Every day is, is a gift.

06:43.540 --> 06:44.540
Anyway.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.300
Um, we'll get into our kickoff topic tonight.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.740
Let me go back to Loki though.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.620
Loki, I'm glad you're doing better and we're all happy to have you back.

06:50.620 --> 06:54.860
Um, I don't think dark soccer, I really wanted to do the first show of our 20th year without

06:54.860 --> 06:55.860
you.

06:55.860 --> 07:00.820
And the news last week was kind of eh, anyway, so, I mean, the biggest headline was Square

07:00.820 --> 07:08.680
Enix and NFTs and here's enough NFT stories to, to fill a dumpster right now.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.500
So we'll get into some of those stories later.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.660
I'm glad you didn't get Ms. Omicron while you're sitting there in the ER.

07:14.660 --> 07:15.660
Cause that was my thought.

07:15.660 --> 07:21.020
I was like, you're sitting, you're in the ER with all these coughing people probably.

07:21.020 --> 07:26.620
Well, yeah, so they have at least separated, like if anybody had respiratory issues, they

07:26.620 --> 07:29.060
got basically banished to the tent outside.

07:29.060 --> 07:36.020
Um, so there was, there's, there was still like some people out there that like, um,

07:36.020 --> 07:39.300
there were still some people like coughing and stuff, but I did my best to like stay

07:39.300 --> 07:42.380
as far away from them as possible.

07:42.380 --> 07:47.340
Um, I just didn't like being in the, in the ER in the first place.

07:47.340 --> 07:51.460
Cause like nobody knows medical procedures, like give me the creeps.

07:51.460 --> 07:53.820
And so I had to have an IV.

07:53.820 --> 07:54.820
I did not like that.

07:54.820 --> 07:55.820
Oh yeah.

07:55.820 --> 07:56.820
You don't, you don't like that.

07:56.820 --> 07:59.860
They gave you that good painkillers stuff like pills and shots.

07:59.860 --> 08:00.860
Yeah.

08:00.860 --> 08:01.860
I don't like needles.

08:01.860 --> 08:03.940
Um, IVs kind of creeping out.

08:03.940 --> 08:07.580
So I had to have the, the, I don't know what you call it, like the intake or whatever.

08:07.580 --> 08:12.500
Like I had to have that stuck in my arm for like hours and I was sitting in the lobby.

08:12.500 --> 08:18.620
I was like, uh, and then, um, so then I had that had to have a CT scan, which is pretty

08:18.620 --> 08:19.620
cool.

08:19.620 --> 08:21.540
Um, those are pretty cool.

08:21.540 --> 08:23.980
Those are kind of like spaces and awesome.

08:23.980 --> 08:24.980
Uh, they're cool.

08:24.980 --> 08:28.540
And I was having all the, the things that my pancreas and they would do the radio, the

08:28.540 --> 08:30.940
ultrasound, it was ultrasound, sorry, not a cat scan ultrasound.

08:30.940 --> 08:33.420
I used to say, oh, we're looking at the food baby.

08:33.420 --> 08:34.420
Yeah.

08:34.420 --> 08:38.660
So that, that was kind of cool that the, you know, that thing is like very like Stargate

08:38.660 --> 08:45.940
E. Um, and then, uh, but most of it was just sitting and it was so boring and you know,

08:45.940 --> 08:50.260
I was just people watching, you know, there is a couple like crazies that came in.

08:50.260 --> 08:57.460
There's somebody that stepped on a nail, um, uh, testicular towards everyone was a contortion

08:57.460 --> 08:58.460
or something like that.

08:58.460 --> 08:59.460
And it's something like that.

08:59.460 --> 09:00.460
How do you hear that stuff?

09:00.460 --> 09:02.980
You're not supposed to, you're not supposed to hear what's going on with the people.

09:02.980 --> 09:03.980
Okay.

09:03.980 --> 09:04.980
So yeah, yeah.

09:04.980 --> 09:05.980
It does not matter.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.860
People will say, where did you go to the ER?

09:07.860 --> 09:09.300
The Walmart pharmacy?

09:09.300 --> 09:15.020
Like no, they seriously were discussing stuff like with patients, like just out loud, just

09:15.020 --> 09:16.020
everywhere.

09:16.020 --> 09:19.920
I'm like, uh, HIPAA yo, I mean, but like say their names.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.080
It's not technical disclosure.

09:22.080 --> 09:27.820
So it, it was, yeah, it was, it was all right, I guess, but it's super like everything took

09:27.820 --> 09:28.820
a long time.

09:28.820 --> 09:33.040
So I was there for like eight hours and I remember like I left there like when I left

09:33.040 --> 09:35.060
the house, I'm like, Oh, this is going to take all day.

09:35.060 --> 09:38.900
And then, yeah, you texted me, you were like, I'm at the ER, I'll let you know about the

09:38.900 --> 09:39.900
show tonight.

09:39.900 --> 09:42.880
And I'm like, you're not going to be at the fucking show tonight.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.600
I'm like, so I'm texting Jamie.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.160
Loki's not coming tonight.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.160
Yeah.

09:48.160 --> 09:52.960
It just, it took a long time to get into the CAT scan is what, what happened was, you know,

09:52.960 --> 09:53.960
with that.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.640
Um, but yeah, I'm glad it's over.

09:55.640 --> 10:01.760
Um, they gave me a bunch of medications that I can't really take because I, because also

10:01.760 --> 10:05.720
not only is it, am I phobic about needles, but I also can't swallow pills for some reason.

10:05.720 --> 10:13.560
So it's like, I am just a medical marvel, um, uh, yet, but yeah, these, you can't, and

10:13.560 --> 10:16.040
I tried, I did get it down once.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.480
And then that was it.

10:17.480 --> 10:22.640
But thankfully though, the, the urologist said like, no, you don't need to take that.

10:22.640 --> 10:26.780
It's only, we'll speed up the process, but like two days or we're all out of like six

10:26.780 --> 10:27.780
to eight weeks.

10:27.780 --> 10:29.300
It's just like, really?

10:29.300 --> 10:30.300
It's no big deal.

10:30.300 --> 10:36.120
Um, so that's a relief, but did, did the process finish Loki or are we still waiting?

10:36.120 --> 10:37.680
No, we're still waiting.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.680
Oh no.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.680
Ooh.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.680
So like they, okay.

10:40.680 --> 10:45.120
Like the initial measurement they said was nine millimeters, which is enormous.

10:45.120 --> 10:52.760
Um, but then she said it was, it was like a, uh, grain of rice, I guess, but bigger,

10:52.760 --> 10:56.440
like, so like four by seven grain of rice shape.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.440
Oh my God.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.320
Did they do the sound thing to try to reduce it?

11:00.320 --> 11:02.000
No, not yet.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.320
They're waiting to see.

11:03.320 --> 11:09.120
So, um, as long as it doesn't pull in ever given, they go in there sideways.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.120
We're okay.

11:10.120 --> 11:18.440
I was, I was telling Loki before when I had mine, they did, uh, break mine up a little

11:18.440 --> 11:19.440
bit.

11:19.440 --> 11:25.120
Um, but Dan had one and I've had one in the pain.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.120
Isn't like that sharp pain afterwards.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.560
It tends to be a little bit more dull as it's passing.

11:30.560 --> 11:34.640
Yeah, it's been like, thankfully the last few days have been fine.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.960
And the other days that I do feel it a little bit, like it's just uncomfortable.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.880
Um, and I'll just take like ibuprofen or something for that.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.200
And then that's fine.

11:43.200 --> 11:49.120
Um, the only other thing that I don't like about it is I occasionally, although I haven't

11:49.120 --> 11:52.040
for the last few days, I'll get chills without having a fever.

11:52.040 --> 11:57.440
So that sucks because then my, my abdomen muscles tighten up and it hurts worse.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.440
Not a ton.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.120
Like, it's just like uncomfortable.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.640
I mean, that's probably, it's not like painful.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.120
It's just like, this is uncomfortable.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.680
It's like a sore muscle.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.280
Well, take care of yourself.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.480
Take care of yourself, Loki.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.080
And it's good.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.280
It's good to have you back.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.640
So, um, yeah.

12:12.640 --> 12:16.640
The good news though, is I haven't been drinking Red Bulls for the whole week.

12:16.640 --> 12:20.160
So, you know, shouldn't be, yeah, there you go.

12:20.160 --> 12:26.920
Maybe this'll be a, we don't know that you have to, I'd say it's a likely candidate.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.000
The time to, uh, kick that habit.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.040
Maybe I did want to mention this though, since I didn't get to have you here last week to

12:33.040 --> 12:34.040
talk about this.

12:34.080 --> 12:38.560
Um, you know, we have to go back to like two weeks ago and on December 25th, I had spent

12:38.560 --> 12:39.560
that day with Dark Sakura.

12:39.560 --> 12:43.680
And we talked a little bit about that on the show, but then the day after our last show,

12:43.680 --> 12:47.240
which was the 26th, I actually got to see you, Loki.

12:47.240 --> 12:53.640
And I wanted to show this to listeners because Loki gave me a little something, something

12:53.640 --> 12:57.200
and I want to, and by the way, I actually have two of them because one of them is for

12:57.200 --> 13:01.600
Dark Sakura because Loki was like, you'll, you'll probably see her before I do.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.520
Um, and what I have, let me open my bag again.

13:05.520 --> 13:12.240
I actually have an NES cartridge, a physical copy of this little indie game we've talked

13:12.240 --> 13:13.560
about on this show.

13:13.560 --> 13:18.200
A lot of times it's called Pixel Poops number two.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.200
There it is.

13:19.200 --> 13:23.220
The actual cartridge, actual NES cartridge.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.120
And it's very legit, Loki.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.120
Congrats.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.120
I have to confess though.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.160
I haven't played it yet cause I don't have a working NES.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.360
So I feel like nobody told me this was out yet.

13:32.360 --> 13:38.360
I don't have, I'm not selling the physical cards yet cause I, I don't have enough of

13:38.360 --> 13:39.360
them.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.400
It's a secret advance release for special people, Dark Sakura.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.200
Did you not hear me say I have two and one's for you?

13:46.200 --> 13:51.040
So happy.

13:51.040 --> 13:55.240
And part of the reason I need to bring you your copy is that you probably have a working

13:55.240 --> 13:56.240
NES.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.240
We can play it on.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.680
So I want to see, I want to see it on the original hardware.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.440
So I'll see if we can lend you an NES.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.440
Yeah.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.720
Uh, Tiger Claw says you are holding a one of a kind prototype of an NES cartridge of

14:07.720 --> 14:08.720
the game.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.720
Yeah, true.

14:09.720 --> 14:10.720
I guess that is true.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.720
So, um, that's awesome.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.720
Limited edition.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.400
I'm just, I'm happy my friend made a game and I want to support it.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.960
So thank you Loki for, uh, hooking me up with a cartridge.

14:17.960 --> 14:18.960
That's great.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.920
He also has your, uh, animal crossing cards too.

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
Yes.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.200
Star Cyrus animal crossing cards are in here.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.080
And I think was there two magazines?

14:25.080 --> 14:26.240
I forgot to look.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.920
I think it's just one.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.200
Oh, nevermind.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.200
You get the cards.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.720
The magazine.

14:31.720 --> 14:32.720
All right.

14:32.720 --> 14:33.720
But I'll show you the magazine.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.640
It's, it's a copy of the cool shit magazine that Loki was featured in.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.640
So it's pretty cool.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.640
So awesome.

14:38.640 --> 14:39.640
Scan the article.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.640
Yeah.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.640
Oh yeah.

14:41.640 --> 14:42.640
There you go.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.640
All right.

14:43.640 --> 14:44.640
Um, okay.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.640
Uh, enough.

14:45.640 --> 14:46.640
Let's get into talking about games here.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.760
Uh, we're talking about the consumer electronic show here at the top.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.600
Not usually a lot of gaming news that comes out of consumer electronic show, but this

14:53.600 --> 14:55.880
year, pretty big teas, right?

14:55.880 --> 14:56.880
Loki.

14:56.880 --> 14:57.880
Yes.

14:57.880 --> 14:58.880
I'm very excited.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.640
This is coming at some point, but we just didn't know what the details were.

15:02.640 --> 15:06.220
So that's the Sony PlayStation VR two.

15:06.220 --> 15:14.360
They had formally announced it now, of course, no details aside from some of the specs, because

15:14.360 --> 15:22.960
this is CES, no price, no release date availability, good luck with that.

15:22.960 --> 15:28.360
But it is going to be for the PlayStation five, obviously, uh, there are some new dedicated

15:28.360 --> 15:29.360
controllers for it.

15:29.360 --> 15:34.400
They call them sense because there's two of them get it dual sense.

15:34.400 --> 15:40.920
Um, so they look like your bog standard, you know, VR controller.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.680
I mean, you've got the ring, you've got the kind of handheld stuff.

15:43.680 --> 15:48.040
They have the face button split between the two controllers and analog six split between

15:48.040 --> 15:49.040
the two controllers.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.600
It's almost like basically having the controller split.

15:50.600 --> 15:55.100
And I don't see that there's like shoulder or a trigger buttons on the top there.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.440
Probably there are triggers underneath.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.700
They typically have that.

15:57.700 --> 16:02.400
So yeah, kind of like a PlayStation dual sense controller just split.

16:02.400 --> 16:07.660
And then, um, of course, some pretty impressive specs on the actual device itself.

16:07.660 --> 16:16.260
So it's got an OLED display with 4k resolution, uh, 2000 by 20, 40 pixels per eye, uh, refresh

16:16.260 --> 16:18.520
rate up to 120 Hertz.

16:18.520 --> 16:25.540
They're going to have 110 degree field of view and also has eye tracking, which is pretty

16:25.540 --> 16:26.540
cool.

16:26.540 --> 16:27.540
And I'm curious to see how they do.

16:27.540 --> 16:32.260
Well, a lot of times with the eye tracking, they may use that for foveted rendering where

16:32.260 --> 16:37.460
they basically render a higher detail where you're looking and everything else is less

16:37.460 --> 16:38.460
detailed.

16:38.460 --> 16:43.580
So it's a way to save on render, um, rendering processing power.

16:43.580 --> 16:50.300
Um, don't know about a whole lot of the games that are coming out for, aside from horizon.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.780
Um, what was it?

16:52.780 --> 16:55.780
There's a horizon.

16:55.780 --> 17:00.140
Some one of their series forbidden West zero Dawn, like a forbidden horizon game in that

17:00.140 --> 17:05.420
universe that they showed like five seconds of it looked cool, but yeah, we barely got

17:05.420 --> 17:06.420
a taste.

17:06.420 --> 17:07.420
Yeah.

17:07.420 --> 17:11.620
Um, and pricing don't know what the price is yet on that, but I'm expecting expensive.

17:11.620 --> 17:19.340
Um, we got to say is until, until Dawn rush of blood too.

17:19.340 --> 17:25.140
And I'm there, I'm telling you, can I, can I say my favorite part of this whole PlayStation

17:25.140 --> 17:28.820
five VR one fucking wire.

17:28.820 --> 17:29.820
Yes.

17:29.820 --> 17:30.820
Oh yeah.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.380
One fucking wire.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.380
Thank you.

17:33.380 --> 17:36.500
Cause the PlayStation four is spaghetti.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.500
It is.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.460
It's a mess, but it's, you know, years old tech now.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.460
USB headsets.

17:41.460 --> 17:45.180
I mean, now they have the tracking on the, you know, it's inside out tracking.

17:45.180 --> 17:48.140
So you don't have a camera that you have to have anymore.

17:48.140 --> 17:54.180
And then of course, everything now can be put through USB type C. So one cord, that's

17:54.180 --> 17:55.180
it.

17:55.180 --> 17:58.340
Um, yeah, definitely doable.

17:58.340 --> 18:02.060
So I, I'm very curious to see what else they have for it.

18:02.060 --> 18:06.220
Um, I think we'll see probably up versions of a lot of existing games.

18:06.220 --> 18:10.420
Like, like beat saber will have to exist on this thing has to back.

18:10.420 --> 18:14.740
Backwards compatibility to like, I'd want to see, like, if they do like stuff with backwards

18:14.740 --> 18:19.660
compatibility, I would hope so too.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.620
But yeah, I kind of want one, even though I don't play VR stuff.

18:22.620 --> 18:23.620
I do.

18:23.620 --> 18:24.620
Yeah.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.740
I just don't have the room for it.

18:26.740 --> 18:33.460
I like enough VR stuff where like, and I liked PS four VR enough where it's like, okay, I

18:33.460 --> 18:34.620
want to get the PS five VR.

18:34.620 --> 18:39.220
I mean, I have to get a PS five first, but I still feel like this is far enough out.

18:39.220 --> 18:42.340
Maybe there'll be a super bundle by this holiday who, of course, whether I can get

18:42.340 --> 18:44.860
my hands on one or not is going to be anyone's business.

18:44.860 --> 18:50.540
Um, but, uh, yeah, I, it's, it sounds very enticing and I'm, I'm just glad Oculus has

18:50.540 --> 18:54.180
a little more competition with something with the higher specs, you know, that's a little

18:54.180 --> 19:01.140
more, you know, of 2022 than of, you know, 2016 or whenever the PS four VR came out.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.900
Um, so yeah, I, I just, I I'll definitely check it out.

19:04.900 --> 19:08.660
I was pretty happy with the PlayStation four VR.

19:08.660 --> 19:13.660
And I think just having, you know, better graphics, more fluid, better stuff is just

19:13.660 --> 19:16.860
going to, um, be even more step up.

19:16.860 --> 19:19.900
Uh, I can't wait to play some more of the workout games and all that.

19:19.900 --> 19:24.320
So they said, so yeah, that horizon games, uh, horizon called the mountain and they said,

19:24.320 --> 19:30.660
it's actually going to be a, a proper game, not just a port of the other, or like an experience,

19:30.660 --> 19:33.100
like a lot of the early VR on PlayStation.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.100
Yeah.

19:34.300 --> 19:39.380
And then, um, you know, the other thing to mention too, is what those sense controllers

19:39.380 --> 19:43.680
is they also have the haptics in there, just like the PlayStation dual sense.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.700
So that'll be pretty cool too.

19:45.700 --> 19:46.700
Yeah.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.540
I can't wait for things like no man's sky to support it too, even though, but the thing

19:49.540 --> 19:54.500
about VR and, you know, I, I really enjoy it 20 minutes at a time.

19:54.500 --> 19:59.140
Like I'm just not going to play a hours long game exclusively in VR.

19:59.140 --> 20:01.140
I just, I can't handle it.

20:01.140 --> 20:03.620
Um, but it's great for things in short bursts.

20:04.140 --> 20:07.580
So that's why Beat Saber is so fucking good because you can play five songs, take the

20:07.580 --> 20:08.940
headset off, take a break.

20:08.940 --> 20:09.940
Okay.

20:09.940 --> 20:10.940
Now I can play a little more and I'm fine.

20:10.940 --> 20:12.580
At least that's the way it is for me.

20:12.580 --> 20:16.620
So, um, yeah, so that's more than I can pretty much do.

20:16.620 --> 20:17.620
I know.

20:17.620 --> 20:18.620
I know.

20:18.620 --> 20:24.120
But, well, I mean, I know you used to kind of be like, not a fan of first person stuff,

20:24.120 --> 20:27.020
but you seem to have made dead by daylight work for you.

20:27.020 --> 20:30.980
Is there, was there a trick there or something different or I just have to get used to it.

20:30.980 --> 20:35.500
And sometimes if I'm having some vertigo issues already, then I, I can't play.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.700
Ah, I see.

20:36.700 --> 20:43.020
Like I had this, uh, one thing and it was when I was pretty soon off of my meds where

20:43.020 --> 20:44.620
I was awake at like three in the morning.

20:44.620 --> 20:51.580
And so I logged on to play and I had myself like a really, really good pig game, right?

20:51.580 --> 20:58.260
In Larry's lots of turns, lots of, you know, and pigs are fast, fast character.

20:58.260 --> 20:59.260
Yeah.

20:59.260 --> 21:04.260
So I got really motion sick and actually had to step away, take my nausea medicine, come

21:04.260 --> 21:05.260
back.

21:05.260 --> 21:08.460
Well, I still got a four K, but still, so, but it was a good game.

21:08.460 --> 21:13.120
So it's a similar kind of thing ish where you got to do it in short bursts, maybe depending

21:13.120 --> 21:14.120
on if I do it.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.120
Yeah.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.120
Yeah.

21:16.120 --> 21:20.740
If you do it, um, like, and it also depends on the nature of it, if it honestly, if it's

21:20.740 --> 21:24.180
either too smooth or not smooth enough.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.180
Yeah.

21:25.700 --> 21:30.100
And that, that is going to be an interesting feature of this PlayStation five VR is that

21:30.100 --> 21:32.420
it will be very smooth, right?

21:32.420 --> 21:35.980
That's going to be part of the, like the refresh rates supposed to be a lot better, right?

21:35.980 --> 21:41.060
So yeah, I can see where, um, that could be interesting, but I also remember you played

21:41.060 --> 21:46.300
some VR game at gamer X or one of those, you and I were both there and it was, you were

21:46.300 --> 21:49.860
like, uh, you were like, I could play that.

21:49.860 --> 21:50.860
Yeah.

21:50.860 --> 21:57.340
The game wasn't so bad, but even so, when I was done, I, my sense of depth was all off.

21:57.340 --> 21:58.340
Yeah.

21:58.340 --> 21:59.340
I hear you.

21:59.340 --> 22:02.660
Um, Hey, since we're kind of set all about just about everything we've had to say on

22:02.660 --> 22:07.140
this topic and we're about to get into our gaming weeks, um, you kind of alluded to there,

22:07.140 --> 22:08.300
the med situation.

22:08.300 --> 22:12.180
And I know that kind of like you had your big study this week and everything, right?

22:12.180 --> 22:15.300
So anything you want to comment on that whole thing?

22:15.300 --> 22:17.420
I just congrats on getting through that.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.100
I know it was a difficult period.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.100
Yeah.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.100
Yeah.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.100
Yeah.

22:22.100 --> 22:29.820
So basically in a nutshell, what happened is, um, I hope that didn't sound funny.

22:29.820 --> 22:33.420
I'm still having some issues with my mic being recognized.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.060
No, you're, you're, you're coming through.

22:36.060 --> 22:37.060
Okay.

22:37.060 --> 22:38.060
Anyway.

22:38.060 --> 22:40.060
Um, so I had two types of studies.

22:40.060 --> 22:51.500
Um, uh, I'm trying to remember the other one, the M M S L T S R T, um, it's, it's some,

22:51.500 --> 22:53.860
it's some type of nap test.

22:53.860 --> 22:54.860
Yeah.

22:54.860 --> 23:04.540
Um, but anyway, um, what, what they, it's a multiple sleep latency test at the MSLT.

23:04.540 --> 23:05.540
Okay.

23:05.820 --> 23:11.500
So at any rate, what happens is that they hook up all of this shit to you and it's a

23:11.500 --> 23:13.780
lot of wires, lot of wires.

23:13.780 --> 23:18.540
They put this putty in my hair to get it to stick to my scalp.

23:18.540 --> 23:20.700
And I mean, I had them here, I had them here.

23:20.700 --> 23:21.700
They were here.

23:21.700 --> 23:22.700
They were here.

23:22.700 --> 23:23.700
They were on my neck.

23:23.700 --> 23:28.260
I had one right here for eye movement.

23:28.260 --> 23:31.700
She's pointing everywhere around my eyes.

23:31.900 --> 23:36.300
I had one on my throat for like snoring, I guess.

23:36.300 --> 23:43.780
I had another one, um, on my jaw for sleep talking, I guess, which apparently I did mumble

23:43.780 --> 23:45.260
a bit in my sleep.

23:45.260 --> 23:53.180
Um, I had ECG monitors on electrocardiogram for those who may not be in the know, um,

23:53.180 --> 23:59.100
they put, uh, they put monitors on my legs.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.980
They put them on my arms.

24:01.980 --> 24:05.180
And so that was just for the nighttime test.

24:05.180 --> 24:10.620
So now me, my average bedtime is like between one and 3 AM.

24:10.620 --> 24:11.620
It depends.

24:11.620 --> 24:12.620
I'm just a night person.

24:12.620 --> 24:15.980
I'm always more alert at night.

24:15.980 --> 24:21.500
They had me go into bed like closer to nine, which is like, what am I in elementary school?

24:21.500 --> 24:22.500
Right.

24:22.500 --> 24:28.220
So, um, but I did manage to go right to sleep, which was weird for me.

24:28.220 --> 24:34.900
Um, and then I woke up at midnight and I was wide awake and I laid wide awake.

24:34.900 --> 24:40.820
There were no, there's a window in there, but it was kind of blacked out.

24:40.820 --> 24:47.700
And if I had to go pee, I had to, you know, call someone in to disconnect the box that

24:47.700 --> 24:49.420
all my wires were connected to.

24:49.420 --> 24:50.420
Oh, geez.

24:50.420 --> 24:56.940
And I've got all this on, on my, uh, my Twitter and I'll find the link for, um, the, the,

24:56.940 --> 24:59.700
uh, it's somewhere on my profile at dark Sakura.

24:59.700 --> 25:02.460
Um, I'll find the link though for chatters.

25:02.460 --> 25:12.580
Um, so what, um, finally the lady's like, look, if you can't, if we can't get six hours

25:12.580 --> 25:16.700
of sleep out of you, then we're going to have to do this test again.

25:16.700 --> 25:19.860
And the first thing I thought, oh, they go put that shit in my hair.

25:19.860 --> 25:23.700
So, um, I was like, look, I brought my anti-anxiety meds.

25:23.700 --> 25:29.100
I have not been taking them except when I am desperate to sleep.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.820
Can I take one?

25:30.820 --> 25:37.140
And she's like, okay, because really my, my anti-anxiety stuff is more of an anti-histamine.

25:37.140 --> 25:43.020
And so it was basically the equivalent of taking like two Benadryl instead of one Benadryl.

25:43.020 --> 25:44.020
Right.

25:44.020 --> 25:52.420
Um, so, um, also just to go ahead and, and say this, there are other kinds of sleep tests

25:52.460 --> 25:55.180
that you can take home, but this one is not one of them.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.700
It's not like a basic sleep apnea test.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.700
Right.

25:58.700 --> 26:01.340
Oh, and I also had the finger monitor for, I guess, oh, two.

26:01.340 --> 26:04.860
So, so you got through, you got through the night, you got through the six hours.

26:04.860 --> 26:09.380
I got through the night and they woke me up at 6 AM.

26:09.380 --> 26:13.940
And um, of course, now keep in mind, I haven't had any caffeine for two days now.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.980
Oh, well a whole day.

26:15.980 --> 26:22.380
And then, so the next part of it was I was doing five naps and people were like, oh,

26:22.380 --> 26:25.300
you get to take a nap several times a day.

26:25.300 --> 26:26.300
How lovely.

26:26.300 --> 26:27.300
No.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.900
It's hard to do just, or it's hard to do that many.

26:29.900 --> 26:30.900
Yeah.

26:30.900 --> 26:34.900
The thing is that for me is that during the day when I am unmedicated, I will nod off

26:34.900 --> 26:35.980
at a moment's notice.

26:35.980 --> 26:37.780
I am exhausted during the day.

26:37.780 --> 26:38.900
I am sleepy.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.860
I, I could go to sleep.

26:41.860 --> 26:47.180
Probably right now, if you put me on the bed, I would probably take a nap and it's only

26:47.180 --> 26:48.180
6.40.

26:48.980 --> 26:54.940
So, um, at any rate, uh, first one I laid down and I dreamed.

26:54.940 --> 26:56.580
Second one, same thing.

26:56.580 --> 26:57.580
Third one, same thing.

26:57.580 --> 27:01.620
The fourth one, I think I stayed awake through the nap time, or at least if I slept, I didn't

27:01.620 --> 27:02.620
remember sleeping.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.620
I didn't remember dreaming.

27:03.620 --> 27:09.260
Fifth one, I dreamed through the whole thing, like pretty vividly, pretty quickly.

27:09.260 --> 27:12.780
And each of the naps were anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes.

27:12.780 --> 27:18.740
So in between I ate some really terrible reheated.

27:18.740 --> 27:22.340
I'm going to ask you to fast forward a little bit because we're well, I just have to say

27:22.340 --> 27:24.220
one thing because it was hilarious.

27:24.220 --> 27:25.220
Yeah.

27:25.220 --> 27:28.620
The French toast that they gave me, I sent a picture to Tiara and they said, it looked

27:28.620 --> 27:29.620
like melancholy toast.

27:29.620 --> 27:34.380
And that's what I'm calling it from now on depressing toes, but so you got through the

27:34.380 --> 27:38.860
whole process and are you able to get back on some of the stuff you were doing before

27:38.860 --> 27:39.860
and all that?

27:39.860 --> 27:43.820
I'm easing back into my meds.

27:43.820 --> 27:51.340
Just because if I can get away with taking fewer or smaller doses, I would prefer to

27:51.340 --> 27:59.700
do that, but I already, I'll just go ahead and say what I'm on.

27:59.700 --> 28:02.700
The four things that I had to quit taking was Zoloft.

28:02.700 --> 28:04.500
I don't care.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.500
Normalize it.

28:05.500 --> 28:06.500
Right?

28:06.500 --> 28:07.500
True.

28:07.500 --> 28:11.820
Zoloft and for anyone out there who has to take an SSRI, there's no shame in it.

28:11.820 --> 28:15.780
If you need medication, take it.

28:15.780 --> 28:18.460
I went back to taking half of my regular dose.

28:18.460 --> 28:24.780
I am now taking 75% of my regular dose and I'm feeling pretty okay on it.

28:24.780 --> 28:28.520
I take Provigil, which is something that they give to people with narcolepsy, but they also

28:28.520 --> 28:32.780
give it to people with chronic fatigue syndrome, which I have been diagnosed with.

28:32.780 --> 28:33.800
I'm taking less of it.

28:33.800 --> 28:38.360
I'm actually needing less of it than I used to to stay awake during the day.

28:38.360 --> 28:40.040
That's excellent.

28:40.040 --> 28:48.320
I take a sleeping medication called Trazodone and I was taking four of them a night to sleep.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.720
I am now getting to sleep with one of them and staying asleep.

28:51.720 --> 28:54.600
The weaning has actually been good for me.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.160
Then I take another one called Prazosin.

28:56.160 --> 29:02.080
I am taking my same dose of that and that's something that I take for PTSD.

29:02.080 --> 29:08.760
I do not mind talking about my medications because honestly, if I can normalize mental

29:08.760 --> 29:17.040
issues and show everybody that you can be on them and be a regular, well, I'm not regular,

29:17.040 --> 29:18.120
but you know what I mean?

29:18.120 --> 29:21.160
A mostly regular person.

29:21.160 --> 29:26.480
But anyone can be on medication, whether or not you think that they are, and it's something

29:26.480 --> 29:28.020
that needs to be normalized.

29:28.020 --> 29:30.620
People need to be able to talk about.

29:30.620 --> 29:33.420
That is all true, but it is still your business at the end of the day.

29:33.420 --> 29:34.420
And I don't care.

29:34.420 --> 29:39.100
For me, if I'm in a position that I can help people normalize their treatment and normalize

29:39.100 --> 29:43.380
dealing with mental issues, I'm all for it.

29:43.380 --> 29:48.980
And the thing is, is that all four of those that I was on are also used to treat narcolepsy.

29:48.980 --> 29:55.540
They cannot see if I have narcolepsy until they take me off the stuff that treats narcolepsy.

29:55.540 --> 29:58.540
I get it.

29:58.540 --> 30:01.340
That's kind of the whole thing behind it.

30:01.340 --> 30:03.060
And I'm still not doing any driving right now.

30:03.060 --> 30:04.540
I'm not exactly safe to drive.

30:04.540 --> 30:09.280
I'm still having slightly catapletic moments.

30:09.280 --> 30:12.500
I'm not really sure what to wish somebody that's been through your situation.

30:12.500 --> 30:15.420
I don't think I can say like, gosh, I hope the test results were good.

30:15.420 --> 30:18.220
I just, I hope you get answers.

30:18.220 --> 30:24.060
I hope you get answers and it puts the puzzle together for the doctors and all that good

30:24.060 --> 30:25.060
stuff.

30:25.060 --> 30:27.500
Well, hopefully I'll get the results soon.

30:27.500 --> 30:28.660
I'm off for another week.

30:28.660 --> 30:35.460
So I did take the Wednesday night after my test, I took that off from streaming and I

30:35.460 --> 30:39.180
took last night off from streaming.

30:39.180 --> 30:45.460
But in streaming notes, I only have three more days to go till I hit the 25 out of 30

30:45.460 --> 30:46.460
day thing.

30:46.460 --> 30:49.620
And I'm doing a joinathon on Wednesday.

30:49.620 --> 30:50.620
This Wednesday?

30:50.620 --> 30:51.620
Yeah, this Wednesday.

30:51.620 --> 30:52.620
How fun.

30:52.620 --> 30:56.140
It's basically just going to be like a random little half-assed marathon.

30:56.140 --> 30:57.940
And if people want to follow, great.

30:57.940 --> 30:58.940
I've got some prizes.

30:58.940 --> 31:02.040
If people want to subscribe, great.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.100
I have prizes.

31:04.100 --> 31:07.620
But mostly I just want to hang out and bullshit.

31:07.620 --> 31:08.620
Sounds good.

31:08.620 --> 31:12.960
What's with, why don't you, oh boy, why don't you tell us about the rest of your gaming

31:12.960 --> 31:14.820
week as we're getting into the segment.

31:14.820 --> 31:17.440
Tell us about the other types of games you've been playing this week.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.520
I've actually been playing a lot of games.

31:20.520 --> 31:25.000
First of all, I started Cyberpunk 2077 since it's on Stadia.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
It plays very stably.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.080
The car steers like shit with a keyboard and it won't let me use a controller.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.080
Oh, wild.

31:34.080 --> 31:38.120
And I even hooked, for those who are watching, I even hooked this sucker up.

31:38.120 --> 31:43.720
My Street Fighter Wii wired Xbox controller.

31:43.720 --> 31:48.600
That's interesting because, you know, I remember early on when all the crazy like graphic issues

31:48.600 --> 31:52.640
and bugs were happening with Cyberpunk, a lot of people were saying, hey, this is the

31:52.640 --> 31:57.220
best case used for Stadia yet because Stadia is the best place to play it.

31:57.220 --> 32:01.000
It's the least broken there because, you know, you're running on a relatively uber computers,

32:01.000 --> 32:04.600
but it's interesting that you ran into kind of the other issue about you can't really

32:04.600 --> 32:06.280
control it the way you want to.

32:06.280 --> 32:09.680
Yeah, but that's still not as big of a deal to me.

32:09.680 --> 32:13.960
I just lowered the steering sensitivity and it's kind of all right.

32:13.960 --> 32:19.840
But yeah, the steering sensitive and there's a lot more buttons to remember.

32:19.840 --> 32:23.120
I kind of had to put myself a little bit into a Mass Effect thing, but I do hate that

32:23.120 --> 32:24.280
it's first person.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.240
I desperately hate that it's first person.

32:26.240 --> 32:29.720
And if I could find a way to make it third person, I would do it.

32:29.720 --> 32:32.980
So I didn't play a whole lot of it.

32:32.980 --> 32:34.520
It's got some interesting factors in.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.560
It could be a good game.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.800
I don't know if I'm going to stick with it.

32:36.800 --> 32:44.120
I might actually go play Avengers next, but I've also been just sort of working my way

32:44.120 --> 32:46.760
through some of my Steam games as well.

32:46.760 --> 32:50.680
I had this game called Demons Tilt.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.120
That's a pinball game, right?

32:52.120 --> 32:53.120
It is a pinball game.

32:53.120 --> 32:57.040
It is a spiritual successor to the Crush series.

32:57.040 --> 33:03.080
So Alien Crush, Devil's Crush, and Jockey Crush.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.840
Oh, I didn't know those were related.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.000
That's cool.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.220
It's a spiritual.

33:07.220 --> 33:13.360
I don't think it's by the same people, but it's definitely in that style.

33:13.360 --> 33:18.640
It feels like playing Devil's Crush or Alien Crush or any of them.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.040
It's a lot of fun.

33:20.040 --> 33:26.160
I've got a VOD of it on my channel from playing it, and I think that's actually going to become

33:26.160 --> 33:34.060
just like a regular casual thing for me to play on a stream, because like I said a few

33:34.060 --> 33:39.760
weeks ago, when my work schedule changes, my streaming schedule changes, and I'm going

33:39.760 --> 33:43.960
to try to do something that's a little bit more sustainable to get people in at different

33:43.960 --> 33:44.960
times.

33:44.960 --> 33:45.960
Okay, cool.

33:45.960 --> 33:52.000
Yeah, I might even, except for my post-OLR stream, I might be going like at four o'clock.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Oh, wow.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Okay.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Yeah.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.360
Because then my East Coast buddies can hang out with me.

33:59.360 --> 34:02.380
But I've also still been playing a lot of Dead by Daylight.

34:02.380 --> 34:03.380
I got...

34:03.380 --> 34:04.380
Okay, okay, okay.

34:04.380 --> 34:06.380
Dead by Daylight talk.

34:06.380 --> 34:07.380
Quickly.

34:07.380 --> 34:08.640
Okay.

34:08.640 --> 34:13.040
You know who my worst character is?

34:13.040 --> 34:15.360
Everybody's worst character, practically, Nurse.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.360
Nurse, yeah.

34:16.360 --> 34:22.220
I played my very fifth ever game of Nurse, and I had gone through and just put everybody

34:22.220 --> 34:26.800
on their default perks just so that it would force me to try to learn them in ADEPT.

34:26.800 --> 34:31.160
And I was like, oh, I'm bored, let's just play Nurse, which is I think on my VOD of

34:31.160 --> 34:32.840
me saying that.

34:32.840 --> 34:39.840
Well, either I had infants or I had meme people, although all but one of them were

34:39.840 --> 34:41.520
in Nash levels.

34:41.520 --> 34:47.880
I got my first 5K as Nurse and ADEPTed.

34:47.880 --> 34:48.880
Wow, congrats.

34:48.880 --> 34:49.880
Hey, nice.

34:49.880 --> 34:50.880
Good way to do it.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.880
I'll take it.

34:51.880 --> 34:52.880
I'll take it.

34:52.880 --> 34:53.880
Yeah, nice.

34:53.880 --> 34:56.240
That means I never have to try this shit on Sally again.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.440
And I also got ADEPT tag.

34:58.440 --> 34:59.440
Oh, wow.

34:59.440 --> 35:00.440
Congrats.

35:00.440 --> 35:03.080
ADEPT tag is actually easier than I thought it would be.

35:03.080 --> 35:06.640
Her perks are pretty strong compared to the base kit for others.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.880
I'm not looking forward to ADEPTing Plague.

35:08.880 --> 35:09.880
Yeah, yeah.

35:09.880 --> 35:10.880
Oh, congrats.

35:10.880 --> 35:13.400
Honestly, I don't like Pig's perks.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.400
I like playing her.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.400
I hate her perks.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.400
All right.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.400
But yeah, but that's it.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.400
All right.

35:19.400 --> 35:23.600
That's a little diversite in your gaming week there with pinball and cyberpunks.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.600
Cool.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.600
Cool.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.160
And of course I played Fantasian.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.160
Oh, right.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.160
Right.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.160
Right.

35:30.160 --> 35:34.360
Ricky, how was your gaming week?

35:34.360 --> 35:36.280
I think you're muted or I'm not hearing you.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.280
Oh, there we go.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.280
So sorry about that.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.620
Couldn't remember if I was muted or not.

35:40.620 --> 35:43.800
So this week I've been playing Minecraft.

35:43.800 --> 35:47.240
I know it's a shock.

35:47.240 --> 35:53.980
I've been very busy on the server and doing server admin stuff, mainly server admin stuff

35:53.980 --> 35:57.080
lately because I'm running the server.

35:57.080 --> 36:05.080
So today we finally got our server converted over the paper MC, which made it much better.

36:05.080 --> 36:10.560
We've been having like lag issues, like all sorts of crazy like issues from like literally

36:10.560 --> 36:15.680
nothing that should be causing like we have very few players on where have all the optimizations

36:15.680 --> 36:18.640
we could possibly put on the server in there.

36:18.640 --> 36:26.000
And it was just not doing the thing like it's ridiculous.

36:26.000 --> 36:32.520
So switching the paper just magically made everything work just fine, which is fantastic.

36:32.520 --> 36:37.560
And that's how kind of we ran the server last season with Collision MC and stuff like that

36:37.560 --> 36:40.360
and how they're doing it this year.

36:40.360 --> 36:43.620
So I just said bite the bullet and take, you know, put that in there.

36:43.620 --> 36:48.160
I don't know why we were on Fabric in the beginning in the first place, I think is because

36:48.160 --> 36:54.860
somebody wanted to run their personally developed mod packs in there.

36:54.860 --> 36:57.440
And now that player isn't playing on the server.

36:57.440 --> 37:02.660
So he made a bunch of recommendations that we followed and they were bad recommendations.

37:02.660 --> 37:08.220
So once they started ignoring the recommendations, then everything started working.

37:08.220 --> 37:11.200
So yeah, we finally got that done.

37:11.200 --> 37:15.800
And I did a big build for like a harbor and stuff.

37:15.800 --> 37:20.900
I think last week I put out an episode and I should be doing a new one here pretty soon.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.940
So it's been a lot of fun.

37:22.940 --> 37:23.940
Nice.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.500
All right.

37:25.500 --> 37:28.020
Anything else amongst your E.R. adventures and all that?

37:28.020 --> 37:29.020
Just mostly Minecraft?

37:29.020 --> 37:33.080
No, just to explain the DuckTales in the background.

37:33.080 --> 37:39.620
So that is because I convinced my youngest son to watch DuckTales and now he's hooked.

37:39.620 --> 37:40.620
He's hooked on the new series.

37:40.620 --> 37:41.620
Oh, how funny.

37:41.620 --> 37:46.940
But now he watched, he binge watched all three seasons of the new series all this week.

37:46.940 --> 37:51.440
And then he started the old series now.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.140
So I just thought that was funny.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.140
Oh, cool.

37:54.140 --> 37:57.680
You got to make him play the game that DuckTales remastered was pretty good.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.940
I know that I do need the I need to buy that for him.

38:00.940 --> 38:01.940
Yeah.

38:01.940 --> 38:02.940
He wants it.

38:02.940 --> 38:04.020
Didn't it get delisted for a hot minute?

38:04.020 --> 38:05.020
I think it might be back.

38:05.020 --> 38:06.020
I think it like came back.

38:06.020 --> 38:10.060
I don't have it like it's probably like a Disney Afternoon pack or something like that.

38:10.060 --> 38:13.940
Don't they have like there was a Disney thing, but that was a different set of games.

38:13.940 --> 38:18.140
That was like the Rescue Rangers and those those games that they put in that pack.

38:18.140 --> 38:20.940
It might have had DuckTales 2 in there.

38:20.940 --> 38:21.940
But yeah.

38:21.940 --> 38:22.940
All right.

38:22.940 --> 38:23.940
I'll take it.

38:23.940 --> 38:25.580
Dartasuya in chat says it did.

38:25.580 --> 38:26.580
Yeah.

38:26.580 --> 38:27.580
But I think it came back.

38:27.580 --> 38:28.580
I don't know.

38:28.580 --> 38:29.580
Anyway, I don't think I ever shouted out the chat room.

38:29.580 --> 38:30.580
Hi, chat.

38:30.580 --> 38:31.580
Sorry, guys.

38:31.580 --> 38:32.580
We had a lot to catch up on.

38:32.580 --> 38:34.940
Who and I noticed SJ100Matt says gaming week.

38:34.940 --> 38:37.340
A lot of things at MAGFest, mostly pinball.

38:37.340 --> 38:38.340
Yeah.

38:38.340 --> 38:39.340
MAGFest was this weekend.

38:39.340 --> 38:43.700
And boy, I bet it was I bet it was a little strange with everything going on in the world.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.540
But Dragon Con was weird, too.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.020
I was very happy to see all the pictures and things I'm seeing.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.700
Everybody's taking precautions.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.660
So good for y'all.

38:51.660 --> 38:52.660
Let's see.

38:52.660 --> 38:54.880
Oh, Bobby does confirm it came back seven months later.

38:54.880 --> 38:55.880
That's good.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.460
Bobby Blackwolf also bringing up the Rush pinball table, which he went into great detail

38:59.460 --> 39:00.540
about on his show.

39:00.540 --> 39:02.880
And I know like Rush is like his favorite band.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.840
So I am not surprised at all to hear that he went all in on that table.

39:05.840 --> 39:09.540
But Darsakha, I know you're kind of the pinball queen here at OLR.

39:09.540 --> 39:12.700
Did you see on that Rush pinball table or and are you like, oh, that looks good?

39:12.700 --> 39:16.860
Or you just kind of like, no more space?

39:16.860 --> 39:17.860
You're muted.

39:17.860 --> 39:21.460
Y'all check your mutes.

39:21.460 --> 39:28.980
I would, in a heartbeat, get rid of ACDC and Guns N' Roses for Rush.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.420
OK.

39:30.420 --> 39:34.700
And Dan just might come home to find them gone.

39:34.700 --> 39:37.780
That Guns N' Roses table is pretty nice, though, even if it is old axle.

39:37.780 --> 39:38.780
It's not.

39:38.780 --> 39:39.780
No, no, no.

39:39.780 --> 39:40.780
I don't have the old Guns N' Roses.

39:40.780 --> 39:42.220
No, I was going to see Jack Guns N' Roses.

39:42.220 --> 39:43.220
No, I know.

39:43.220 --> 39:46.020
I was going to say a lot of people might be thinking of that older table and it isn't

39:46.020 --> 39:47.560
it is the I used to have one.

39:47.560 --> 39:50.420
But with with old axle, that's my point.

39:50.420 --> 39:53.480
It's the thing you see in the video is dad bought axle.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.480
Yeah.

39:54.480 --> 39:58.000
No, I the Jersey Jack Guns N' Roses is pretty fun.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.480
I mean, I really am a big fan of the Jersey Jack tables.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.840
But man.

40:05.840 --> 40:12.520
Like I would play like the ACDC table, I play a couple of songs on that one just because

40:12.520 --> 40:13.520
they're the ones I like.

40:13.960 --> 40:15.040
Aerosmith table.

40:15.040 --> 40:20.080
I played like nothing but sweet emotion on that one.

40:20.080 --> 40:23.720
I'll play this, you know, some of the different Guns N' Roses one, because I mean, I was in

40:23.720 --> 40:28.360
middle school when at the height of Guns N' Roses, you know, an appetite for destruction

40:28.360 --> 40:29.360
came out.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.720
It's I just was it's interesting.

40:30.720 --> 40:35.560
You named those two tables is one you're willing to sacrifice, but not Megadeth.

40:35.560 --> 40:36.760
I don't have Megadeth.

40:36.760 --> 40:37.760
I thought you did.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.760
What was the other machine I'm thinking of?

40:38.760 --> 40:39.880
Do we have Megadeth?

40:39.880 --> 40:42.640
I think you do not even know.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.640
I don't know.

40:43.640 --> 40:47.240
Go out in your garage and look, I'm pretty sure there was a Megadeth out there.

40:47.240 --> 40:48.880
Well if we had Megadeth that shit can go.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.040
Because they only did two good songs.

40:51.040 --> 40:56.960
I can't believe she doesn't even fucking know what machine she has.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.160
They rotated it out so fast.

40:59.160 --> 41:00.160
I love it.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.600
No, we might be borrowing that one.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.600
Oh, I think you know what?

41:02.600 --> 41:04.160
And I think Dan was saying something about that.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.760
I don't think I think it is you guys are housing it.

41:06.760 --> 41:10.200
Now I have sweating bullets stuck in my head.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.020
Where's my ABBA pinball table?

41:12.900 --> 41:17.220
That's my, that's my, so, so Bob, Bobby was talking about like, you know, you have your

41:17.220 --> 41:20.500
like whatever it is, Holy grail pinball table and like the one thing that's going to make

41:20.500 --> 41:23.300
you go, well, I guess I'm buying a pinball table.

41:23.300 --> 41:25.060
And for him, it was rush for me.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.060
It's ABBA.

41:26.060 --> 41:29.740
So let's, let's all Mandalorian, but I like that one.

41:29.740 --> 41:30.740
Yeah.

41:30.740 --> 41:31.740
All right.

41:31.740 --> 41:32.740
Anyway.

41:32.740 --> 41:37.620
Well, the thing is I have to see who did the, um, the design behind this one.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.740
Is it a Steve Ritchie?

41:39.780 --> 41:42.260
Uh, this new rush table.

41:42.260 --> 41:43.260
Yeah.

41:43.260 --> 41:48.860
No, Bobby said it on his show and it was somebody who did, um, other tables.

41:48.860 --> 41:50.860
He went into some of the, uh, John Borg.

41:50.860 --> 41:51.860
That was it.

41:51.860 --> 41:52.860
Oh, okay.

41:52.860 --> 41:53.860
Cool.

41:53.860 --> 41:54.860
Cool.

41:54.860 --> 41:55.860
Cool.

41:55.860 --> 41:56.860
Cool.

41:56.860 --> 41:57.860
Cool.

41:57.860 --> 41:58.860
Yeah.

41:58.860 --> 41:59.860
Um, honestly, the only thing that would make this table even better is if it was a Papa

41:59.860 --> 42:00.860
Duke design.

42:00.860 --> 42:01.860
Hmm.

42:01.860 --> 42:02.860
All right.

42:02.860 --> 42:05.460
Then again, Papa Duke did theater and world cup and Arabian nights.

42:05.460 --> 42:08.220
Oh, those are, yeah, those are classics.

42:08.220 --> 42:10.060
Those are like three of my favorite tables right there.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.060
All right.

42:11.060 --> 42:12.060
Yeah.

42:12.060 --> 42:13.060
Let me get into my given week.

42:13.060 --> 42:16.020
Um, because I actually played a little more than final fantasy 14 this week and dead by

42:16.020 --> 42:17.020
daylight.

42:17.020 --> 42:18.020
I played some other stuff as well.

42:18.020 --> 42:21.020
Um, and a lot of that was thanks to trying to be good about streaming every day this

42:21.020 --> 42:22.020
week.

42:22.020 --> 42:24.540
So I played, um, final fantasy for pixel remaster.

42:24.540 --> 42:28.020
Um, and I, I decided to just grab that.

42:28.020 --> 42:31.100
I was going to say on the steam sale, but I don't think it was actually on steam sale.

42:31.100 --> 42:32.300
I just grabbed it.

42:32.300 --> 42:35.700
Um, because you know what, if I'm going to double dip on any final fantasy, I'm going

42:35.700 --> 42:37.020
to do it with four.

42:37.020 --> 42:40.700
Um, and I say double dip because I'm still holding out hope that they're just going to

42:40.700 --> 42:43.460
put out the pixel remasters again on console.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.420
Um, I really hope they do.

42:45.420 --> 42:46.660
They've got to change the font.

42:46.660 --> 42:50.180
If they do it, the font doesn't annoy me as much as I thought it would, but the more I

42:50.180 --> 42:54.500
thought about it, the more I realized, well, if you're playing on a tablet or phone, that's

42:54.500 --> 42:55.940
right in front of your face.

42:55.940 --> 42:59.500
And if you're playing on a computer screen on steam, that's right in front of your face.

42:59.500 --> 43:03.180
And so the font isn't annoying, but on a television, that's going to be very annoying.

43:03.180 --> 43:05.900
They might be able to get away with it on switch because you can play a switch in handheld

43:05.900 --> 43:06.900
mode.

43:06.900 --> 43:10.820
Um, I'm hoping there's going to be some sort of pixel remaster deluxe that allows you

43:10.820 --> 43:13.660
to change the fonts and maybe has some other extras in it.

43:13.660 --> 43:16.980
Cause the, the, um, extras that come with pixel remaster are pretty light.

43:16.980 --> 43:22.300
You get a variety of artwork and like a jukebox, very standard stuff, uh, for a game.

43:22.300 --> 43:26.360
Um, maybe you can get the bonus dungeon back in there from the Game Boy advanced version

43:26.360 --> 43:27.360
or something.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.360
That would be really cool.

43:28.360 --> 43:35.780
Um, so, um, uh, yeah, um, I was enjoying my time with it.

43:35.780 --> 43:39.100
The thing that surprised me is that the translation is new.

43:39.100 --> 43:41.460
I was like, is this the DS translation?

43:41.460 --> 43:43.020
I just don't remember it very well.

43:43.020 --> 43:46.820
Um, but I did some research on Reddit and it turns out they actually did a new translation

43:46.820 --> 43:50.060
for, um, Final Fantasy three remaster and four remaster.

43:50.060 --> 43:53.100
For whatever reason, they did not recycle the DS ones.

43:53.100 --> 43:55.380
I don't know if that was a space concern or what.

43:55.380 --> 44:01.660
So they actually did do new, uh, um, translations and it, it really does change things of the

44:01.660 --> 44:06.600
story that you might remember from Final Fantasy two growing up with that as a kid.

44:06.600 --> 44:11.400
Because of course, and I think we all know this now, those games were not great translations

44:11.400 --> 44:16.840
because they had to cut many corners to get that game to fit.

44:16.840 --> 44:21.320
And they did things and took shortcuts that I don't think Square would do today in retrospect

44:21.320 --> 44:24.220
and how big the Final Fantasy franchise got here after all.

44:24.220 --> 44:28.920
Um, so it is nice to play those games in more of a context, uh, they were meant to be played.

44:28.920 --> 44:32.920
So, um, yeah, I'm enjoying the pixel remaster outside of the font.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.820
Uh, and I even got the scene for you, Spoony Bard.

44:35.820 --> 44:39.080
I'm happy to report it is still intact in that whole scene.

44:39.080 --> 44:40.080
People would riot in the streets.

44:40.080 --> 44:45.500
Yeah, people, they have to keep that the same, even if you do a new translation, um, also

44:45.500 --> 44:46.660
a new to me game.

44:46.660 --> 44:50.560
I played a game called Death's Door, which came out in the last year and is an indie

44:50.560 --> 44:51.560
favorite.

44:51.560 --> 44:52.560
A lot of people were really enjoying.

44:52.560 --> 44:54.040
I took requests on Twitter.

44:54.040 --> 44:56.240
I was like, Hey, what game should I stream?

44:56.240 --> 44:57.640
Steam sales going on right now.

44:57.640 --> 44:58.640
Convince me.

44:58.680 --> 45:00.480
And, uh, Mike Deff said, get this game.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.920
And so I was like, all right, I will.

45:01.920 --> 45:02.920
Uh, and it's cute.

45:02.920 --> 45:03.920
I'm glad I picked it up.

45:03.920 --> 45:10.000
It's um, I want to say it's kind of like Zelda-y, but kind of like with, um, I don't want to

45:10.000 --> 45:11.520
say a roguelike element to it.

45:11.520 --> 45:15.080
It feels like it, even though the game actually isn't roguelike and nothing is like randomized

45:15.080 --> 45:16.080
in that regard.

45:16.080 --> 45:19.640
Kind of has that sort of feel to it, uh, kind of like puzzle-y type of thing.

45:19.640 --> 45:24.760
Um, and, uh, it's a, it's a very unique art style, uh, which I think kind of draws a lot

45:24.760 --> 45:25.840
of people in as well.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.120
So I've been enjoying my time with that.

45:27.120 --> 45:31.360
It's kind of, it's one of those, like, you have to repeat something three or four times

45:31.360 --> 45:33.960
until you're like, Oh, that's the pattern.

45:33.960 --> 45:35.160
And then you like get it.

45:35.160 --> 45:38.480
So, uh, it's definitely one of those types of games, uh, learning it.

45:38.480 --> 45:39.480
So I had a good time with that.

45:39.480 --> 45:42.640
Um, so I'll probably stream that again for another day next week.

45:42.640 --> 45:47.440
Uh, and then I played a little bit of No Man's Sky, went back to an old favorite because

45:47.440 --> 45:52.880
Expedition 4 started this last week and, uh, I started the expedition on stream.

45:52.880 --> 45:58.400
Um, I only played a little bit off stream and what I meant to do off stream was not

45:58.400 --> 45:59.680
what I finished off stream.

45:59.680 --> 46:03.680
And I'll talk a little bit about that, uh, tomorrow, Monday, when I stream No Man's Sky

46:03.680 --> 46:05.320
again after work.

46:05.320 --> 46:08.580
I'm very excited to get back in on that and I'll tell you about the interesting stuff

46:08.580 --> 46:09.740
that's happened.

46:09.740 --> 46:17.160
Long story short, um, user bases are really allowing people to cheese some of the mechanics.

46:17.160 --> 46:22.620
And Alan, who also streams No Man's Sky sometimes, he has already done with the expedition.

46:22.620 --> 46:24.100
He didn't stream any of it.

46:24.100 --> 46:25.780
He finished it in like four hours.

46:25.780 --> 46:30.640
He said that was the fastest one of all four, um, because A, he knew what he was doing better

46:30.640 --> 46:33.580
than any of the three times that he'd done it before.

46:33.580 --> 46:36.480
And B, the user bases made it simple.

46:36.480 --> 46:39.160
There was a user base called Get Eggs Here.

46:39.160 --> 46:42.860
There was a user base called, uh, Six Bones Here.

46:42.860 --> 46:46.580
And like the user bases that people are making are just telling people like, hey, come here

46:46.580 --> 46:48.060
for the easy grind stuff.

46:48.060 --> 46:51.580
Um, which is, and even if you're not in multiplayer mode, you can still see the bases that other

46:51.580 --> 46:52.820
people make.

46:52.820 --> 46:56.280
And for those of you that think that's a cheesy way to do it, hey, it's your choice to go

46:56.280 --> 46:58.740
or not go to the user made bases.

46:58.740 --> 47:00.260
So there is that.

47:00.260 --> 47:05.860
Uh, Mike Defton Chat talking about Death's Door saying, it's Zelda in terms of exploration

47:05.860 --> 47:07.420
and puzzles.

47:07.420 --> 47:09.420
Combat is fail and learn.

47:09.420 --> 47:12.500
Quest Buster says, I got my wormy head in No Man's Sky.

47:12.500 --> 47:15.380
It took me around seven or eight hours blind to finish the expedition.

47:15.380 --> 47:17.660
I used one of those bases for the eggs.

47:17.660 --> 47:20.480
I guess I'll go ahead and say here, me too.

47:20.480 --> 47:22.300
That is the thing I got finished off stream.

47:22.300 --> 47:28.120
I wasn't expecting to because somebody made a base called Egg Farm and I was like, how

47:28.120 --> 47:30.720
do you farm those eggs?

47:30.720 --> 47:34.780
And uh, for those that don't know the game so well, there are these alien eggs and usually

47:34.780 --> 47:38.180
when you, when you farm them by attacking them, you have to pick them up right away

47:38.180 --> 47:43.800
or they'll disintegrate and then a swarm of really nasty aliens comes out to attack you.

47:43.800 --> 47:47.080
It's like immediately going to like a four star rating in Grand Theft Auto.

47:47.080 --> 47:48.080
It's really nasty.

47:48.080 --> 47:53.280
Well, what somebody did at this base, they found one of those outlets and they built

47:53.280 --> 47:58.840
a wall around the entire base and put the eggs inside that wall.

47:58.840 --> 48:04.200
So it's like two walls basically like, like Tron like bikes in tandem going around the

48:04.200 --> 48:05.200
base.

48:05.200 --> 48:10.720
Um, and what they did is that, so when you pick up the eggs, the things spawn, they don't,

48:10.720 --> 48:13.560
they figured out this cause they never spawn on top of you.

48:13.560 --> 48:17.560
They always spawn a little ways away and they, they're too stupid to get through walls.

48:17.560 --> 48:20.840
So you pick up the eggs, the aliens can't get through the walls.

48:20.840 --> 48:23.760
In about a minute they dissipate and you go back to your ship.

48:23.760 --> 48:24.760
Easy peasy.

48:24.760 --> 48:27.920
So that was, that was very much the sound of that.

48:27.920 --> 48:28.920
Yeah.

48:28.920 --> 48:29.920
Right.

48:29.920 --> 48:31.760
So it's make it, making the grinds pretty easy.

48:31.760 --> 48:34.200
So we'll finish that on my Twitch tomorrow.

48:34.200 --> 48:40.760
Uh, I actually logged, I stopped my game off stream at that base so I could show it tomorrow

48:40.760 --> 48:41.760
on stream.

48:41.760 --> 48:45.160
So if you want the coordinates for whatever reason and all that, uh, it is in that same

48:45.160 --> 48:46.160
galaxy.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.880
Um, what was I calling that one?

48:47.880 --> 48:51.920
It had the planet called like Bonesville that had all the, somebody named the planet with

48:51.920 --> 48:54.360
all the ancient bones, Bonesville.

48:54.360 --> 48:58.400
So he knew where to go and it was on another planet in that same galaxy, which I think

48:58.400 --> 49:02.120
I was calling like, uh, what the, what was it?

49:02.120 --> 49:04.120
Like shucks or something like that.

49:04.120 --> 49:05.120
I don't know.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.120
S S S C something.

49:06.120 --> 49:11.960
So, um, yeah, so we'll play that, uh, again tomorrow on my Twitch over at Rob Roberts.

49:11.960 --> 49:12.960
Okay.

49:12.960 --> 49:15.280
Um, we have some gaming news to talk about.

49:15.320 --> 49:18.520
There's been a few things that have happened this week among CES and other stuff.

49:18.520 --> 49:22.240
Now that we're getting back into the routine and I hope all of you that went back to work

49:22.240 --> 49:23.960
this week had a great time.

49:23.960 --> 49:28.360
Well, I mean, I know work isn't always a great time, but I hope you hope you had a good restful

49:28.360 --> 49:31.440
holiday that made getting through this week easy.

49:31.440 --> 49:34.360
And now, uh, some of the video game companies are getting back to work.

49:34.360 --> 49:38.480
So we are getting a little more news and we're going to start with Loki's headline.

49:38.480 --> 49:39.480
Yeah.

49:39.640 --> 49:49.320
So, um, Jeff Ross, who was, um, at one time, I think with a sucker punch productions, um,

49:49.320 --> 49:52.520
or I'm sorry, uh, Ben's studio.

49:52.520 --> 49:58.760
So Jeff Ross, they, they were the ones that did like days gone and resistance.

49:58.760 --> 50:07.600
And, um, so apparently days gone, didn't perform as well as Sony had wanted it to.

50:07.600 --> 50:16.640
So they sold, I guess, over 8 million copies, but because, um, it wasn't enough that they

50:16.640 --> 50:20.840
basically canned a sequel to the game.

50:20.840 --> 50:26.320
And I don't understand how they can be disappointed with like over 8 million copies being sold

50:26.320 --> 50:28.720
and it's still more to this day.

50:28.720 --> 50:37.160
Um, maybe cause of the review scores, it wasn't as, you know, well-reviewed, um, but with

50:37.200 --> 50:43.040
that though, there's, you know, they're still pitching other ideas.

50:43.040 --> 50:49.840
So the studio is looking to maybe even go back to, um, an open world resistance game,

50:49.840 --> 50:51.880
which I am all for.

50:51.880 --> 50:52.880
I love to resist.

50:52.880 --> 50:55.520
Yeah, that is a great series.

50:55.520 --> 51:05.560
It was like, um, it was like, it was actually, it was funny cause it reminded me of, oh wow.

51:05.560 --> 51:08.280
That was, oh, okay.

51:08.280 --> 51:09.280
So, okay.

51:09.280 --> 51:12.600
And then my internet just went, uh, took a big hit there.

51:12.600 --> 51:17.160
So as we're broadcasting live, there must've been a huge hiccup on Comcast and because

51:17.160 --> 51:22.840
Loki dropped and my thing just went to a red box and then immediately came back.

51:22.840 --> 51:25.780
So we probably lost a few frames on Twitch.

51:25.780 --> 51:29.400
The podcast will sound normal cause it comes from a localized recording, but I just have

51:29.400 --> 51:32.800
to buy a little more time while Loki reconnects here.

51:32.800 --> 51:35.300
That was a very strange, connected.

51:35.300 --> 51:36.300
You are here.

51:36.300 --> 51:37.300
Yeah.

51:37.300 --> 51:38.300
We just don't see you yet, but we hear you.

51:38.300 --> 51:39.300
That's good enough.

51:39.300 --> 51:41.980
Um, so you were talking about, uh, the resistance open world.

51:41.980 --> 51:42.980
Yeah.

51:42.980 --> 51:44.620
So, um, yeah, I'm all for that.

51:44.620 --> 51:47.620
You know, the resistance was such a really fun game.

51:47.620 --> 51:51.620
The first one, at least I'm second, I don't remember if I liked it as much, but the first

51:51.620 --> 51:52.980
one I really enjoyed.

51:52.980 --> 51:58.260
Um, this is coming back from like when I kind of liked it, you know, call of duty two and,

51:58.260 --> 52:02.780
um, even like, uh, like the original modern warfare games and stuff like that were pretty

52:02.780 --> 52:05.260
fun, but like, it was just a really fun kind of mix.

52:05.260 --> 52:10.980
So like a world war two shooter with like this alien halo, almost elements to it.

52:10.980 --> 52:11.980
And I really enjoyed it.

52:11.980 --> 52:16.060
So yeah, I would love for them to bring that back.

52:16.060 --> 52:17.900
It's more so, you know, than days gone.

52:17.900 --> 52:22.300
I never played days gone and yeah, the zombies are kind of overdone.

52:22.300 --> 52:26.560
You know, I can't be helped, but reminded of that story about how tomb Raider apparently

52:26.560 --> 52:29.380
undersold and everybody was sitting here going what?

52:29.380 --> 52:33.440
But I mean, that was evil cause like tomb Raider, I still feel like probably that game

52:33.440 --> 52:37.840
did better than days gone, but I still feel like a lot of people grab days gone.

52:37.840 --> 52:42.700
Do you think maybe Sony shot it in the foot by giving it away too early on like PlayStation

52:42.700 --> 52:44.480
plus and that sort of thing?

52:44.480 --> 52:46.040
I don't think they even shot it in the foot.

52:46.040 --> 52:50.760
Like if they're saying they sold 8 million copies of it, like true, like how many copies

52:50.760 --> 52:52.320
of this game did you want to sell?

52:52.320 --> 52:53.880
Like, I don't know.

52:53.880 --> 52:56.520
And then it's on a PC now.

52:56.520 --> 53:03.400
Um, so I mean, yeah, who knows how much sold like 8 million copies.

53:03.400 --> 53:09.000
And they're saying, you know, that's a huge success, but like, I don't know, 8 million

53:09.000 --> 53:10.520
copies in less than two years.

53:10.520 --> 53:13.520
Like it could be about the budgets.

53:13.520 --> 53:15.240
I don't know.

53:15.240 --> 53:20.540
Maybe I don't know what the budget of the game was, but like, I mean, geez, like what

53:20.540 --> 53:23.320
are your expectations?

53:23.320 --> 53:25.440
Make those a little bit more realistic, please.

53:25.440 --> 53:26.440
I know.

53:26.440 --> 53:27.440
All right.

53:27.440 --> 53:31.080
This game that you're developing has got to sell a hundred million copies to 10 million

53:31.080 --> 53:32.080
people.

53:32.640 --> 53:33.640
Yeah.

53:33.640 --> 53:38.000
Um, I'm going to apologize to the live folks because I see that we are kind of going up

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
and down with the frames and I don't know what's causing it.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.600
There's no inclement weather or anything going on.

53:44.600 --> 53:50.560
So this is just some weird and plus, Loki, you, you lost your internet hiccup too, right?

53:50.560 --> 53:54.000
So this must be some wider like west coast issue.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.240
I'm still like connected with everything.

53:56.240 --> 53:59.600
So like it just, my camera like blinked and I was about it.

53:59.600 --> 54:00.600
So I don't know.

54:00.600 --> 54:01.600
Something weird is going on you guys.

54:02.120 --> 54:03.120
I'm very sorry.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.480
We're going to push through for the sake of the podcast folks.

54:04.480 --> 54:07.120
Um, but thank you for sticking with us here live on Twitch.

54:07.120 --> 54:10.720
I don't think I said this yet, but we do tape live of course, every Sunday night at nine

54:10.720 --> 54:15.160
o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG network,

54:15.160 --> 54:19.680
twitch.tv slash a V O G network, the voice of geeks network and where we've been for

54:19.680 --> 54:22.080
now our 10th year at VOG network.

54:22.080 --> 54:26.040
I mean, technically the birthday's in like April, but, um, you know, we're celebrating

54:26.040 --> 54:27.680
20 years a little early at OLR.

54:27.680 --> 54:29.840
So why not celebrate 10 a little early at VOG?

54:30.080 --> 54:33.160
So one of the things I liked about resistance for some of the weapons that they had in there,

54:33.160 --> 54:38.920
they had, this was like even before like Titanfall had this where you had bullets basically that

54:38.920 --> 54:43.200
you could tag like an enemy with, and then you can shoot them and they go around walls

54:43.200 --> 54:46.480
and stuff and they'd follow kind of home in on it, which is pretty awesome.

54:46.480 --> 54:51.880
Plus it had a really cool campaign where you unlock a bunch of weapons throughout the campaign

54:51.880 --> 54:56.800
and then you play like almost like a new game plus, and then there's brand new weapons you

54:56.800 --> 54:58.640
unlock as well.

54:58.640 --> 55:00.640
So that's pretty awesome.

55:00.640 --> 55:01.640
That's pretty cool.

55:01.640 --> 55:02.640
All right.

55:02.640 --> 55:05.520
Um, yeah, we just dropped down to zero.

55:05.520 --> 55:08.160
Like we're not actually putting anything out on Twitch right now, but you guys are still

55:08.160 --> 55:09.160
here.

55:09.160 --> 55:11.480
So I know the internet was flickering for me.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.480
Was it interesting?

55:12.480 --> 55:18.160
Cause I was like, I know it's not the internet because, um, uh, you guys are still here.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.160
So it's weird.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.160
All right.

55:20.160 --> 55:22.600
I'm going to try to push through and talk about this next story.

55:22.600 --> 55:25.280
Um, and just hope the internet kind of recovers there.

55:25.920 --> 55:31.160
If I have to, I'll stop the show and fire up, um, a different Twitch server to see if

55:31.160 --> 55:32.440
it's on Twitch's end.

55:32.440 --> 55:34.080
But for now, let me get into this next story.

55:34.080 --> 55:38.480
So, um, of course, consumer electronics show happened this week and arcade one up showed

55:38.480 --> 55:44.200
up and arcade one up was showing off some new cabinets, including a brand new pack mania

55:44.200 --> 55:45.200
cabinet.

55:45.200 --> 55:48.480
Um, I think pack mania has been in before.

55:48.480 --> 55:54.040
This pack mania cabinet though, it's actually a little bit of like a best of Namco collection.

55:54.040 --> 55:59.840
When I tell you what's in this cabinet, it's Dig Dug, Dig Dug 2, Galaga, Galaga ADA, Galaxian

55:59.840 --> 56:04.560
Mappy, pack and pal, pack land, pack man, pack man plus, pack mania, rolling thunder,

56:04.560 --> 56:06.620
rompers and super pack man.

56:06.620 --> 56:10.200
So what's interesting about these arcade one up machines and for a lot of people that have

56:10.200 --> 56:14.640
been bitching this whole time, well, they only put like four games in those machines

56:14.640 --> 56:16.280
and that sort of thing.

56:16.280 --> 56:22.720
Um, I feel like this is sort of like, oh, well now that they've kind of put out all

56:22.720 --> 56:26.520
those games, now they're starting to do more of these super machines.

56:26.520 --> 56:30.280
So again, this really feels like a, like a super Namco collection.

56:30.280 --> 56:33.200
So dark soccer, how do you feel hearing about that?

56:33.200 --> 56:34.200
Cool.

56:34.200 --> 56:35.200
Yeah.

56:35.200 --> 56:38.280
You, are you, are you kind of interested in it?

56:38.280 --> 56:39.280
I'm sorry.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.600
Are you, are you kind of interested in that machine?

56:41.600 --> 56:42.600
Kinda.

56:42.600 --> 56:43.600
Yeah.

56:43.600 --> 56:44.600
I don't blame you.

56:44.600 --> 56:45.600
I'm sorry.

56:45.600 --> 56:46.600
You're breaking up really badly.

56:46.600 --> 56:47.600
Okay.

56:47.600 --> 56:48.600
Then that's so weird.

56:48.600 --> 56:49.600
Did you see the other ones too?

56:49.600 --> 56:54.520
The other, uh, the Midway and uh, Midway and the Azhar Academy.

56:54.520 --> 56:55.520
Oh yeah.

56:55.520 --> 56:56.520
Yeah, no, I was going to get, I was going to get there.

56:56.520 --> 57:00.160
There's a mortal combat one as well, which is just a Midway collection.

57:00.160 --> 57:02.160
I want this machine to be honest.

57:02.160 --> 57:04.800
I want the Tron one more, but I really liked this one.

57:04.800 --> 57:10.680
This one has bubbles, defender, gauntlet, joust, klax, mortal combat one, two and three,

57:10.680 --> 57:15.620
paper boy, rampage, tapper, tuben, ultimate mortal combat three and wizard of war.

57:15.620 --> 57:17.400
That's a really solid collection.

57:17.400 --> 57:22.520
And then there's a centipede cabinet, which is basically an Atari collection with a car

57:22.520 --> 57:29.440
asteroids, asteroids, deluxe, centipede, crystal castles, gravatar, a liberator, lunar lander,

57:29.440 --> 57:34.800
major havoc, millipede, missile command, space dual, super breakout and tempest.

57:34.800 --> 57:41.720
Now on top of all this, we have the very first pro machine that is coming out.

57:41.720 --> 57:44.520
This pro machine is a killer instinct cabinet.

57:44.520 --> 57:50.880
It is a clone of the first killer instinct cabinet, but it is a 19 inch screen and it

57:50.880 --> 57:55.900
has, it's basically the size of an actual arcade cabinet.

57:55.900 --> 57:59.000
You know how arcade one up machines, they're kind of a little bit smaller, even though

57:59.000 --> 58:02.240
you still play them standing up and they kind of, they kind of feel right.

58:02.240 --> 58:06.960
They still, they, but this is going to be the actual size of a real cabinet.

58:06.960 --> 58:10.680
And for that reason, you can expect it's probably going to be closer to a thousand dollars,

58:10.680 --> 58:13.440
but still a pretty nice machine there.

58:13.440 --> 58:16.960
And I'm sure Dark Sakura is probably going to be interested in that.

58:16.960 --> 58:17.960
So all right.

58:17.960 --> 58:18.960
Yeah.

58:18.960 --> 58:20.000
I love that game.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.640
The internet issues are continuing.

58:21.640 --> 58:25.400
So before we get to Dark Sakura's next story, we're going to do a little bit of a break

58:25.400 --> 58:26.400
here.

58:26.400 --> 58:29.680
I'm going to do the whole, turn it off and on again, just to make sure it's not my internet

58:29.680 --> 58:31.040
and we'll be right back.

58:31.040 --> 58:32.880
Please stay with us, folks.

58:32.880 --> 58:39.440
We'll be right back here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

58:39.440 --> 58:41.800
And unfortunately that ended up being the end of the show.

58:41.800 --> 58:45.880
I had some pretty major issues with my upload speed that took a few days for the cable company

58:45.880 --> 58:46.880
to fix.

58:46.880 --> 58:50.440
Sucks when things out of your control happen, but what can you do?

58:50.440 --> 58:53.760
Appreciate those of you that turned up live and those that listened to the podcast this

58:53.760 --> 58:54.760
week.

58:54.760 --> 58:58.200
Sorry it's a late post, but the hobbled upload meant I couldn't even move the recording to

58:58.200 --> 59:03.280
Dropbox and sorry about the abrupt ending, but it is what it is and we'll try again next

59:03.280 --> 59:04.280
week.

59:04.280 --> 59:06.280
Until then, take care everyone.

59:06.280 --> 59:11.360
