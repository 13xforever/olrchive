0	15280	Oculus dev kits come out, kick starting the modern VR movement. Facebook buys Oculus.
15280	19920	Oculus requires a Facebook login, but that's okay because everybody has a Facebook account.
19920	23440	You can't play Oculus games if Facebook is down, but that's okay because that will never
23440	28560	happen, nor will people ever have local problems that makes Facebook unreachable. The Oculus
28560	33840	Quest is going to be renamed the Meta Quest and now there's a problem.
33840	37640	This is my old man YelsicloudUpdate, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers
37640	40840	and Loki to tell you actual details about this headline and the rest of the week's gaming
40840	43920	news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
43920	52560	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
52560	59760	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode
59760	68160	number 901 of our show for tonight, January the 30th of 2022. I cannot believe the first
68160	74080	month of the year is almost over and I feel like I've done nothing with this year. But I've done
74080	78400	these shows week in and week out with my co-host, so say hello first off. I'm Rob Roberts and say
78400	81520	hello to my co-host over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
81520	83120	Sup.
83120	83760	Hi, how are you?
84880	89920	I am okay for not a lot of sleep. I'm remarkably perky.
90800	91920	Good, good. I'm glad you're doing well.
91920	93920	Remarkably perky for me.
93920	97680	You and I were talking about animated emotes on Twitch in chat a minute ago. Yeah,
97680	100880	a lot of streamers are getting access to that now and I didn't even realize
101520	103840	Twitch had built in their own animated thing.
104480	109840	I've actually had slots for five animated emotes for like the last four months.
110480	114320	I think I just finally got around to doing something with it.
116480	121280	But I took my boop pig emote and I animated it.
121920	126560	Yeah, I see it in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,
126560	130160	nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,
130160	134560	twitch.tv slash v o g network. And yes, I see all sorts of emotes in chat.
134560	139040	I see this cute little dog pounding thing that you guys from losing color.
139040	145040	And I need to see about if I had the money, I would absolutely commission Kabuchi.
145040	148000	Yeah, who is absolutely amazing.
148000	153040	But as it is, I'm poor and I have to figure out how to do this on my own.
153040	157840	And usually the very talented ones have a list a mile long because word gets out that they're
157840	163920	talented. And so you got to wait, right? So Kabuchi charges, but the work is worth the money.
163920	169760	Of course, if I had if I had it, I would pay it. I don't have it. So I have to contend with my own
169760	177760	little crazy pixelated. You know, boop on the nose, same, same for me, public, public access,
177760	186240	public domain vector art and snag it together. I know I've done some to myself, but, you know,
186240	190720	I have to I have to really kind of it's a hodgepodge. I might as well use MS Paint,
190720	195520	that's for sure. I don't know what he's made in MS Paint lately, but say hello to tech master Loki.
197360	200000	Yeah, it's all I'm all smeary today, apparently.
200000	201040	What were you painting?
202080	206560	No, no, no, it's just my camera's all fuzzy for some reason. I was trying to figure out why.
206560	211600	I know this is gonna sound silly, but turn it off and on again. No, seriously, because I have a
211600	216720	weird problem with Discord. So I do the call with Bobby Blackwolf. And for some reason on, you know,
216720	220640	because he has the show and I do the call, like the little tease call on the at the end of his
220640	226960	show. And for some reason, Discord forces my camera into the lowest resolution. I don't know
226960	234800	why. And so to get it to work, I have to like stop it in OBS and then start it again, which is so
234800	238400	weird. But it is what it is. I don't know why that is. So
239200	242320	but it just picked the perfect scene. It's like even more blurry.
243200	250240	It just got fuzzier. Yeah. So who cares? It's fine. Well, I'm sick, so that's fun.
250880	255280	Oh, no, it's not the it's not the core. It's not the big one, is it?
255280	257600	Do you use your government tests?
258320	263360	I will. Our ones from school. But yes, yes, these are tests. And OK, it's not that it's just it's
263360	268880	another fun, you know, sore throat fever virus. Sinus infection?
269840	274320	I don't know, but it's fun. Everything's going around, not just the big one,
274320	279760	but everything is going. I had I had a scare on the big sea after the last episode of our.
279760	286320	I found out, you know, how I did that Twin Peaks event. Well, sure enough, one of the actresses
286320	292000	from the show posted to her Instagram that she was sick with. You know what? And I was like,
292000	297360	this this is how I get covid. This is, you know, that would be a fun story.
297360	302720	At least Palmer gives. Well, it was it was the other one. I'm not trying to name names.
302720	306400	I'm not trying to name names or shame anyone. That's why I'm not being as specific. You know,
306400	311440	you stealth folks can figure it out. But, you know, I'm sorry to hear that she got it.
311440	314960	But you're right. It would have been not not that catching covid is funny at all,
314960	319600	because many people have died from it. However, let's look at the fact that, yes, it would have
319600	325120	made for a very interesting party story five, five years from now. And I'm vaccinated, boosted.
325120	330560	So, you know, if I had gone through a week of hell, then, you know, I at least I would be OK.
331360	337360	But but it turns out I use I use my government tests to find out that I actually know it was
337360	345280	my Wario 64 tests because, you know, Wario 64, the person on Twitter that posts all the video
345280	350400	game deals and sales and things like that. Well, out of the blue one day where, you know,
350400	355200	this is how this is how that person makes money, affiliate links to all the Amazon things that
355200	359200	they're posting about and every all those websites that they are. Y'all are giving Wario a ton of
359200	362800	money, but it's fine. I mean, some would say they're doing a public service, never in the
362800	368960	money. Well, out of the blue, Wario posts a link to Amazon. Hey, Amazon has the covid test in stock.
368960	374080	Get them now. And it was one of those odd moments where it's like, OK, the dude who
374960	382000	gives me links to sales on video games ends up being the one to finally let me find a covid test.
382000	387280	And sure enough, I got my Wario 64 covid test. So that was one of the ones I took when I found out
387920	392880	not Laura Palmer exposed me to covid and I was negative. Thank you very much. But I was like,
392880	399040	oh, no, I have a sore throat. Is this it? But I got a bunch of tests from work and they actually
399120	405760	before you can go in the building if you're not like they have you test once a week if you're
405760	411360	vaccinated and if you're not, you have to test every day before you can come into the office.
411920	420400	So because I'm not an onsite technically employee right now, they made me take a rapid test. It's
420400	424400	the first time I've done one of them. And like it came my results came through like right away,
424400	430240	but like you got to be 15 minutes like fine. And of course, it was negative. And I got to go in
430240	436800	and see some of my coworkers and and say hi and get the good coffee that they have at work. Oh,
436800	442160	my God, I miss the work coffee so much. Not like the coffee machines that they, you know,
442160	448080	grind it and brew it, you know, all of that there. But like we have like a coffee cart thing. And
448640	453200	oh, so good. You know what else is only good from carts? Churros, just saying.
456000	460720	Or in the fashion district in Los Angeles. I don't I don't know if it's the gamer in me or
460720	465440	what, but I actually thought the at home covid test was kind of fun. It was like a little at
465440	470880	home chemistry kit. It's like, you know, let's put six drops in here, put this thing in here.
470880	474320	Oh, you got to follow the IQ instructions. OK, I was like, oh, this is kind of fun.
474320	478800	Actually, Rob, what you now know kind of what it's like to do a pregnancy test.
480160	484640	There was I haven't taken one before for fun. I'm just kidding. But yes, I'm sure they're similar.
486160	488640	Except, you know, it's up your nose instead of pee.
490560	495200	All right. I'm going to chat over at Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network.
495200	498880	Did your mom says Wario 64 is the reason why I have a ton of video games.
498960	502960	Graduation, Rob, your nose is pregnant. No, not pregnant.
506480	510720	Let's see. Jaskarine says, what? I love Rob's Olar shirt. Thank you.
510720	513440	Unfortunately, these were only available for a limited time
514080	519840	because we had the store on an old Web site and we no longer use that Web site.
519840	524080	So that just says we've got to get a new store up and running. So I'm sorry. I've
524080	527840	personally been very distracted with my big move coming up, so it hasn't really been a priority.
528480	531360	But we've got to make that happen because Jaskarine wants a shirt. And I'm sure there's
531360	534480	more people out there. And for those on the podcast feed, I'm wearing an orange,
534480	538880	but well, dark soccer design this. It's Orange Lodge Radio, but it's in like a Sega style font,
538880	542000	inspired font, let's say. And it looks like you. I like it.
543680	551120	For the record, I do have all of my original designs and just make an account and I'll
551120	555120	get you the stuff. We've got to open up a store front and throw it all up there. We'll get to
555120	561760	that. I have my own store and it has been. It's really, really easy to do stuff on it.
562480	567920	Nice. Let's see other comments and chat here. Bobby Blackwell says my favorite thing is that
567920	573280	nobody knows who Oreo 64 actually is in terms of is it one person or is it multiple people?
573280	579040	It reminds me of Sushi X from back in the day. No, nobody. I mean, we know now, but we didn't
579040	583920	know then, you know, back in that for those old time gamers like me who used to get excited about
583920	589760	a new month of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine available in stores. You get all excited about
589760	594240	those and you never knew who Sushi X was, but we found out years later it was a variety of
594240	599200	different people, if I'm not mistaken. It's kind of a mantle that was passed along, if I recall
599200	605680	correctly. So anyway, let's get into some more gaming and get into our kickoff topic tonight.
605680	612400	I hate that we're here. We go again with another NFT story. It's just like, God, it just won't
612400	617520	stop. But the reason why we keep bringing it up is because the industry keeps bringing it up
617520	622160	and people ask the industry people about it. And that's exactly what's going on this week.
622160	625680	Loki, I don't know if you would would mind taking us away tonight with this
626800	632080	and our latest update from executives versus the rest of us on NFTs.
632640	636800	Because every time that an executive said, no, listen, you just don't understand
637360	643440	why this is important. You just don't you just don't get it. That's always worked out for them
643440	650160	all the time. Like, I mean, just ask Microsoft how the original Xbox One launch or pitch was going.
652000	661760	So because people don't like NFTs and there's been a lot of backlash that they had made some
661760	667200	comments regarding it, basically saying that I think gamers don't get what a digital secondary
667200	672560	market can bring them for now, because the current situation of context of NFTs, gamers really
672560	680000	believe it's destroying the planet. And second, a tool for just speculation. But what we at Ubisoft
680000	685760	are seeing is the first or team first is the end game. The end game is about giving players
685760	690320	opportunity to resell their items once they're finished with them or they're finished playing
690320	697520	the game itself. Now, way to like totally not address anybody's concerns on that. It's like,
697520	702160	I don't I still don't understand with like the block chain stuff like I get
703200	707520	with these digits you're talking about. They're just items with numbers on them,
707520	719280	which is no big deal. But. Diem is managing a whole host of digital items without block chain,
719280	726000	like why do we need to incorporate block chain technology into this?
726960	731120	If you want to talk about speculative market, I mean, all that stuff that's on their digital
731120	737520	marketplace is pretty much speculative. I just think it's stupid. And it's also just like.
738640	745200	Why I like what's the point like. I just won't buy it like I won't play your stupid game like
746160	749360	I don't get the point. And even still, like on top of that, like,
750240	754800	let's say that, you know, there's an item that you can sell.
756240	759920	Does it mean you're going to have a buyer for that item? Like, that's the thing is
759920	764800	they're talking about like, oh, yeah, you can you can sell it later. Well, like,
764800	769680	what if no one wants to buy that piece of garbage? Exactly. That'd be like saying, you know,
770560	777040	hey, guess what? You can sell your old like Madden players, you know, for Madden 05 or something like
777040	781120	that. It's like, yeah, but no one plays that anymore. You know, that's the thing is people
781120	787680	move on. So. I think it's just a big waste. I think it's just if there anything, the reason
787680	793760	why they want to do this and they really could, like I said, do this without NFTs is they want
793760	799360	a piece of that transaction cost for processing the transaction for the buying in the selling of
799760	804960	whatever digital item it is they want to double, triple, quadruple dip on this stuff.
804960	810560	But like I said, team does this already with their digital items that they have on their
810560	815760	storefront. And they're like, not even things you can technically use for us. Sometimes it's
815760	823680	like training cards or a picture of a pickle or something like that. It literally has no utility,
823680	830320	but people are being speculative with it and they still take a cut of that on the marketplace. Like
830320	836320	you can do that without NFT. The NFT stuff, all that does is allows it to occur outside
836320	841120	the platform, which is really completely unnecessary. That's one of the other things
841120	845440	I'm not understanding about NFTs is that so many of them I've seen are so damn ugly.
845440	851840	I'm like, who, who wants that now? A lot of that stuff is procedurally generated,
852080	856080	especially like those, the Board Ape Yacht Club. I don't know what the hell it's called.
856080	859680	Sorry. I know Jamie wanted to jump in, but I just wanted to say really quick,
859680	864320	like there's a very popular, I'm just going to say, I'm not going to say who they are
864320	868320	because I'm not giving them free advertising because this company advertises on every podcast
868320	875200	except ours, but it is a very popular site to buy underwear. And I recently actually used this site
875200	881360	and I will say it's expensive as fuck, but it's actually probably some of the best underwear I've
881440	886800	had actually, but they posted on this NFT bandwagon thing. And it's one of those like
886800	891520	ugly ass monkeys that I don't understand. And so many people are like canceling my sub,
891520	897040	done with you, done with this. And I'm like, what this, this website, as far as I know,
897040	902640	had a really good thing going. Why are they throwing it away for a stupid monkey?
902640	908080	That an ugly monkey piece of art. I don't understand. I especially don't understand how an
908080	912480	underwear company gets into NFTs, but I mean, that's, I know I'm getting away from video games,
912480	915520	but it's just money that you can burn and like, look at we're current.
916640	922160	But it just screams to me. It's an investor thing that somebody sat those people down in a room and
922160	926000	said, this is cool. This is where it's going. Anyway. I'm sorry, dark soccer. I know you're
926000	933040	trying to jump in. I was just saying maybe, maybe I should make an NFT that says dark soccer. I made
933040	938560	this NFT. Give me a dollar. No, don't, don't buy into it. Don't just don't. But I know,
939520	946560	but it would be fun to like make a parody and use their tactics to prove how stupid their tactics
946560	953440	are. Um, Bobby Black, I've made exactly a dollar. Bobby Black open chat says the best analogy is
953440	957920	that old buy a star campaign that was around as a kid. People would buy a name, a star after a
957920	962560	family member, that star was now yours. You got a certificate that company went under no one else
962560	968560	recognizes that you own the star or that you named the star. Exactly. You can buy it by a
968560	975680	title. You could be a lot, a Lord or a lady. Uh, it's just, and, and with no actual landowning
975680	981440	rights. The interesting thing that's happened for me in the past week is that I've seen people
981440	987520	that I consider to be intelligent people making pro NFT arguments and trying to actually state
987520	993520	what the reasons are for this. Um, I'm not convinced, but I thought because, well,
993520	998720	here was the argument that I saw where at least it, at least it wasn't somebody just screaming at
998720	1002240	somebody on Twitter. You're an idiot. You don't understand. You're missing out. You're missing.
1002240	1007360	At least I saw somebody say something that was like an actual thought that was a thought. I just,
1007360	1011760	I disagree with the conclusion, but the conclusion was essentially like, well,
1012400	1019680	you buy things in marketplaces all the time in games and essentially the marketplace owns those.
1019680	1024240	Well, what if you could go to a decentralized place where those things were owned? I want
1024240	1028240	to point out, cause I know somebody already typing in chat. I know the Ubisoft thing. Yes,
1028240	1031680	Ubisoft still has it. The comment I read was not in response to this Ubisoft thing.
1032240	1038000	And that was the argument. But to me there, I have two problems with that. Number one,
1038080	1042160	it still doesn't show that those items have any value, especially in video gaming.
1042160	1048960	I think we've seen that there is so much supply and not enough demand. Anytime these things get
1048960	1054000	opened up, especially like the Diablo three real money auction houses is because all of these bots
1054000	1061040	from countries around the world will get in and try to try to screw over Americans and other
1061040	1067440	global people that will get this. And the surprise was very, very few people were buying. And my
1067440	1071680	other, sorry, just real quickly, my other point with to, to kind of counter the, you know what,
1071680	1075360	otherwise, you know, I consider this person to be intelligent. I'm glad they're actually
1075360	1082800	having a real debate about it, but, um, the whole, um, fact that, um, uh, even if it's decentralized
1082800	1088880	to me, that actually opens it up to exploitation. How much have we heard about that? Bitcoin's
1088880	1094640	getting stolen. Crypto is, is like a big on the, uh, on the dark sides of the web and all this
1094640	1100480	stuff. Like it's, it's, uh, it's a wild West and in some ways I'm actually like, maybe
1100480	1106080	decentralization actually isn't good for some of these things. Anyway, Loki, I'm sorry, your point.
1106800	1110880	No, I was just basically going to say that I don't think we're going to have necessarily a problem
1110880	1116800	with bots snatching these up. However, um, it does allow the opportunity to make some of the
1116800	1123920	digital artificially scarce to drive up the price. Um, it's also just a big waste of the time. Like
1123920	1131200	once again, like we have cosmetics for video games have gotten to a point where they are
1131200	1136880	ridiculously expensive for certain things like a whole skin, you know, might be $20 to change
1136880	1143040	it to like blue or something. And now you're talking about, Oh, Hey, let's drive that price
1143040	1149040	up even more. Like, I just don't care. Like, I don't think that it would, it would make sense.
1149040	1157040	The only way that this would actually work is like, say you had some unified platform where,
1157760	1164720	you know, I can create a skin for some avatar and be able to use it across like a bunch of
1164720	1171200	different games from a bunch of different publishers, you know, um, or I, you know,
1171200	1177600	another good example would be like, say if you know, Sony were to sell all of their digital games,
1177600	1185440	like an NFT. So if it could create a secondary market for the digital games that you could go
1185440	1190320	and then resell that later on when you're done playing that game, that would be something,
1190320	1195040	but they're not going to do that because that devalues their stuff and they want,
1195040	1203200	you know, to drive the price up. I just, I just don't see this being done in a meaningful way.
1203200	1209520	And so far what we've seen these game companies use NFTs for is not a meaningful thing. Like,
1209520	1215360	yeah. Ooh, it's a helmet with a number on it. Are you ever going to be able to see that number on
1215360	1219760	that helmet when you're running around shooting people? No, you're not going to stop there and
1219760	1224640	go, wow, you have a number one helmet. No one cares. No one is going to care.
1225200	1229920	You, you, I think a part of what you said really hits the nail on the head.
1229920	1235680	Like, is that this is not the way to convince people to get NFTs ugly ass fucking procedurally
1235680	1240080	generated monkey art is not the way to convince people stealing other people's art, not the way
1240080	1244720	to convince people that NFTs are yet. Now, when you talk about these types of things that like,
1245280	1250240	if I make a design, like maybe something that is like, let's say, let's say, I don't know,
1250240	1255520	like the VOG logo or something that, you know, we, we, you know, have here at VOG and maybe we
1255520	1260560	can take that and put it on in game stuff and we can move that from game to game and things like
1260560	1266480	that. Like there's something there where I'm like, that seems a little more interesting, but I just
1266480	1273120	like, I don't feel that you necessarily need the blockchain's involvement for that. It just takes
1273120	1277520	the right strategic partnerships with companies to make that happen. And then it would actually
1277520	1281760	be regulated, which I actually think at the end of the day is probably a good thing.
1281760	1290560	Yeah. And a lot of times with NFTs now, nowadays, it's just, you own the link to that piece of art,
1291280	1298080	which they can just take it offline too. And that's happened. So it's, it's, it's stupid.
1301280	1306240	Jason in chat says, by the way, great voiceover work tonight, Jason says a value is subcultural
1306240	1310800	niche. NFTs being hype is trying to astroturf that into the mainstream for various reasons.
1310800	1315200	Oh, astroturf it. I love that. Two highly valuable things in Rocket League that mean
1315200	1320240	nothing to a non-player, white zombas and alpha boost. A lot of the problem is the mainstream
1320240	1324800	nature of it more than the thing itself. Well, let's go, let's go back to the comment. And,
1324800	1329920	and this is the other thing that gets me is these executives that are fucking clueless,
1329920	1337040	that I get paid millions of dollars to be fucking morons that just dig their heels in on this stuff
1337040	1342000	and to, to make a claim like, you know, oh, gamers just don't want NFTs cause they don't
1342000	1348800	get it. Yeah. We don't get why you keep shoving it down our throat. Like stop, you know, let it
1348800	1355040	be the niche thing that it is. Is I, I, I, how these folks stay. And of course it's coming from
1355040	1359760	Ubisoft, a company that's got all of that's all sorts of issues up and down anyway. So
1359760	1369200	Ubisoft's getting bought by someone for the years over. Just wait, just wait. All right. Let's move
1369200	1373280	on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week. Dark
1373280	1379840	Sakura, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week? Um, well, as I was saying, um, before the
1379840	1386640	show, I, and I mentioned this last week that I had been redoing my windows 11 on, on, uh,
1386640	1393680	for arm on parallels. Um, I got Mass Effect installed. I tried to run the first game.
1394400	1400160	No, it just would stop. It would go right back to the launcher. So on a whim I tried Mass Effect 2,
1400160	1408960	it loaded just fine. So did Mass Effect 3. So I had to go haul my ass to find a gibbed editor that
1408960	1414480	will work. So I'm going to start a game for Mass Effect 2, then cancel out of the game, modify my
1414480	1426080	save file. Um, and then I can start Mass Effect 2 the way I want to. Um, but I, I don't know what
1426080	1432800	it is, but I think the emulation is getting a lot better. Um, it's, I, I still had trouble with VHS,
1433440	1441920	which I might do the next update and try VHS again. So we'll see. But, um, a, a mutual streamer
1441920	1452320	friend of ours, uh, made use of my VHS and did not care for it that much. Hmm. So, um, anyway,
1452320	1458160	um, I, of course I have played Dead by Daylight right now as the lunar event, lunar new year event.
1458960	1464160	Um, if you log in every day, you get 50,000 blood points every day, which is nice. Um,
1464880	1471120	I have decided to also, uh, try to P350 my Freddy first out of, out of just pure,
1472000	1476640	I don't know, reasons. I don't know why people don't like Freddy. Freddy's awesome.
1477600	1479600	They don't like playing against Freddy. That's what it is.
1481040	1484800	And the thing is like, people are like, oh, Freddy got, Freddy's still freaking strong,
1484800	1490480	no matter how much they have nerfed him, a good Freddy player will nail you. End of story. Um,
1491200	1499520	I have also played a little bit of demons tilt because that game is fun. I picked up the Apple
1499520	1506480	arcade version of Zen pinball. Um, cause it has theater of magic and a few other tables that I
1506480	1511200	like on it. And I own a theater of magic, but I would like to stream a theater of magic as well.
1511200	1519760	So now I can do both. Um, uh, I played, uh, of course I've had, you know, freaking word scapes
1519760	1528240	cause it's great. And I started playing, um, uh, Marvel contest of champions on my iPhone
1529040	1534320	and I don't know, but it's kind of fun. It's just like a little silly fighting game.
1536160	1541760	And one of these days I'll get like characters. I actually like, even though they're random
1543200	1549040	and I think that's about it. All right. Yeah. We'll go to Loki and your gaming week.
1550240	1556560	Um, I did play more than one thing this week, so, um, I, I was feeling pretty brain dead
1556560	1563360	earlier today, so I jumped back into, um, power washing simulator. Oh, good. That's always a nice
1563360	1568400	relaxing game. Yeah. Yeah. A little too much though. It actually almost put me asleep. So I,
1570000	1576240	uh, I had to stop playing it after a while, but, uh, I was washing a carousel. So that's
1576240	1582320	the level I was on for that. Um, and then of course more Minecraft, obviously. Um,
1582320	1587840	I put out my new episode this morning, so that's out there now. My, uh, starter base,
1587840	1593400	which is enormous. So now I got to top that. That's going to be a lot of blandy. Um,
1594960	1599840	yeah, it's pretty much that was pretty much it. I didn't play a whole ton this week. Cause like
1599840	1607120	I said, I haven't been feeling well the last few days. Um, but probably more Minecraft this week.
1608480	1611840	Hey, at least you got a video posted. You keep keeping that going. That's good.
1611840	1617920	So yeah. Everyone check that out on YouTube at Loki. Um, so my gaming week, I actually played
1617920	1622880	a lot this week. Um, yeah, I played some of my usuals, uh, continued on final fantasy 14,
1622880	1626880	of course. Cause you know, y'all know, I love that working on leveling my dancer and my white
1626880	1631280	mage, just depending on what I feel like playing that day as I, I work on my new quest to get all
1631280	1636480	my jobs to 90, uh, to go with this expansion. Cause why not? Uh, and then I've also been playing
1636480	1640480	dead by daylight as well. Probably not as much as dark soccer, but a little bit. Uh, I'm working,
1640480	1644640	I'm actually my first P three 50 is going to probably be Cheryl. Um, cause she's already
1644640	1649360	the P three part. And now I think she's up to like level 46 and you get a decent amount of blood
1649360	1655360	points from this event. So, um, the only thing that ticks me off is I can't get borrowed time
1655360	1660000	to show up on her fucking blood web. And that is when you solo queue, that talent is so needed.
1660000	1665760	It wasn't, it was on there not long ago. No, no, no. I I'm not trying to seek her. So I mean like
1665760	1670560	showing up in your blood web to get it. I can't get it. So it's just, you know what the new thing
1670560	1677360	is right now, right? Hmm. What's that? Like flip flop. Oh, boil over in that whole thing. Yeah.
1677600	1685040	Yeah. I'm like, all I've just been doing is bringing when I'm not doing the, the calendar,
1685040	1690880	the lunar, uh, envelopes, I'm just bringing whatever shortens the distance between, uh,
1691840	1696000	uh, hooks. You gotta be careful too. A lot of killers will just let you bleed out. If
1696000	1701440	you're going to play that game to just mess with killers. So, Oh no, I'm just saying in general,
1702240	1708320	to the, to the millions of listeners we have out there. It's all been slugfest and honestly,
1708320	1713600	I don't like to do that to people. Um, unless they've just been, I don't either, but I will.
1713600	1720320	Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, other games I've been playing, um, uh, let's see. So, uh,
1720320	1726640	some new stuff. I played Taiko no Tatsujin because that, that just came out. A new version of it came
1726640	1732560	out on a, I guess it was PC as well as Xbox, but I picked it up on Xbox game pass. Um, and, uh,
1732560	1736720	I was playing a little bit of it and it's got a, it's got a cute song list. Uh, it has Undertale
1736720	1741040	music in it, which kind of cracked me up. Uh, it has like a variety of different Namco stuff,
1741040	1744240	but then like it has the random like Capcom song. Like there was, you know,
1744240	1748960	Ray you from street fighter five is there. And this was the thing that cracked me the fuck up.
1748960	1752640	Then they have, you know, they have some J-pop songs. They have some, uh, vocaloid,
1752640	1756240	like Hatsune Miku sounding songs. They have a pretty decent mix of things. And then they have
1756240	1761680	pop songs. The most random fucking pop songs are in there. I want you back by the Jackson five.
1761680	1766400	That's not that, that, that obscure. That's a pop standard. Here's the one that made me laugh.
1767200	1771840	You're going to lose Whamageddon every time you play this game because last Christmas by Wham
1771840	1777120	is in the game. Why? I don't know. I don't know, but it's fucking funny. Yeah. It's,
1777120	1781360	it's very memeable. I don't mind the Whamageddon. I mind the Mariah apocalypse.
1781360	1788160	Well, Mariah, Mariah, uh, Taiko no Tatujin is Mariah free, but for whatever reason last
1788160	1793120	Christmas by Wham is there. And that just cracked me the fuck up. So yeah, it's an interesting song
1793120	1797120	list. Uh, I was having a little problem. Like the timing was throwing me and I didn't even,
1797120	1800800	I was listening to Bobby show. He went a little more in depth, uh, on Taiko no Tatujin. Cause I
1800800	1806160	guess it has more issues on PC. Like it won't even play right now. Um, but I, I didn't even
1806160	1809920	know you could go into a calibration mode. I don't like the interface particularly.
1809920	1814240	I do remember playing the switch version and the switch one had a better interface than this one.
1814240	1819600	Um, but this one is with game pass, so I didn't pay anything extra for it.
1819600	1825440	So that was cool. And it has super easy, uh, achievements. You keep getting five point
1825440	1829280	achievements, bing, bing, bing, bing, like, like open a menu and you get an achievement.
1829280	1834880	It's really, really silly. That's for sure. So, um, interesting. Hi Akuma JP is in our chat and
1834880	1839040	I haven't seen Akuma JP in a long time. It's so good to see you. Um, I know life happens sometimes
1839040	1842320	you can't make it every week, but it's so good to see you tonight. And Akuma JP says,
1842320	1848800	Japanese love that song last Christmas. A lot of, a lot of Americans do too, but I think it's become
1848800	1855680	a me like to put it in perspective, you cannot go into a Dennis office in November or December and
1855680	1861760	not hear that song. Cause you know, Dennis office always play that smooth rock. It's time for the
1861760	1870880	smooth mix and now coming up, Kenny G followed by Celine Dion. You know, you know what though?
1870880	1877760	What I am now going to incorporate last Christmas when I eat my KFC
1880320	1886560	for Christmas, you should, you should, because I think that the KFC tradition from Japan is the
1886560	1891760	best tradition ever. Only second to the Jewish tradition of eating Chinese food.
1893600	1898160	Uh, yes. Uh, both good traditions, but if you want to make playing last Christmas and Taiko
1898160	1902320	no Tatsujin your new tradition, you sure can. So I played a little bit of that. It's, it's cute,
1902320	1908640	but I, I didn't play a lot of it because the next day was the release of Pokemon legends,
1908640	1912720	which I picked up, um, Pokemon that I've been saying Pokemon legends are chaos,
1912720	1918880	but I guess it's supposed to be Arceus or Arceus. Um, but, um, you know what language is fluid and
1918880	1923120	I'm saying Arceus because that's what it feels like. You know what these games don't have,
1923120	1927920	it's 2022 and these games still don't have voice acting. So as far as I'm concerned,
1927920	1932640	they're leaving it up to us and our imaginations to dream it up. I have to, I would have to look at,
1932640	1938160	uh, uh, Kana to see how it's supposed to be pronounced there. And that's where they're
1938160	1943200	getting the Arceus from is, is the original Japanese text. Well, and on top of that,
1943200	1951600	a C in that respect would typically be a soft C. So it makes sense to me. Yeah. But then again,
1951600	1959440	people, you know, don't say GIF. I know they say GIF because then the creator, right? So yeah.
1959440	1963920	So he's a nice, I say it's a GIF, GIF thing. And I also say it really doesn't matter what you call
1963920	1968960	the game. Um, it's gonna be the same game at the end of the day. And it's, it's actually,
1968960	1973520	I'm really enjoying it. I'm really, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it, but I did the right thing
1973520	1978320	and I didn't buy into a lot of the hype. And I find when I do this with games, I always enjoy
1978320	1984000	it better because that was my secret with No Man's Sky. Remember I, I didn't, I didn't hate No Man's
1984000	1988800	Sky 1.0. I thought it was a little bare bones, but I didn't hate it because I didn't buy into
1988800	1993040	the fucking hype. And I did that. And believe me, Shane, Shane would send me text messages quite
1993040	1996320	frequently with the latest and I would be kind of like, oh, neat, sounds neat, but I didn't really
1996320	2000480	watch a lot of videos or anything. And I think I'm actually better for it because it made the
2000480	2006240	experience a lot more like, oh, oh, oh, oh, I wasn't expecting, oh, oh. And that was kind of
2006240	2012560	like what it's been playing the game so far. Uh, is, uh, it's, it's neat. So yes, a lot of people
2012560	2018560	are saying that this is like Pokemon meets Breath of the Wild. And I, I absolutely see those
2018560	2024400	comparisons because they've definitely put in like the crafting, the open world, the multiple
2024400	2029680	ways to do things. Uh, even some of the, uh, musical cues sound really familiar. And like the,
2029680	2034800	the interface looks kind of familiar a little bit. I would also say that there's a lot in common
2034800	2039360	with Pokemon Snap, uh, which is a little more of a deeper cut, I think for some people. But
2039360	2046080	I think the way that you are encouraged to like the stealth in this game is actually a little
2046080	2051600	more Pokemon Snap to me, um, in that you have to snap things a certain timing in a certain way,
2051600	2056880	uh, to really get the max points. And I think there's some of that too in this. Um, but I also
2056880	2061360	like that they've really changed the concept of the Pokedex because usually with the Pokedex and
2061360	2066160	the mainline games, you get like half a check for seeing the Pokemon and a full check for catching
2066160	2071920	the Pokemon. In this game, catch them all isn't good enough. You got to catch them all. You got
2071920	2075760	to catch them all off guard. You got to use them all to see certain moves. You got to, you got to
2075760	2081120	do all these different things with it to really master that entry in your Pokedex. Now you only
2081120	2087440	have to get so many, like you don't have to like catch 50 of each Pokemon just to check off the
2087440	2092480	Dex entry. It gives it to you at a pretty low number, but you have to do more than just catch
2092480	2096640	it. And I think that's interesting because it's really been encouraging me to rotate my team more
2096640	2103600	often. Um, so yeah, there's a lot, like I just, I think the gameplay is a lot more interesting
2103600	2108320	than any of the mainline Pokemon games that I've played. I like the fact that there's side quests.
2108320	2112640	I like how the open world lends itself to that. And the fact that you can really feel like you
2112640	2116880	can do things in whatever order. And maybe you feel like you're a little behind in levels on
2116880	2121600	the main quest. Okay, go do these side quests. You know what? I need to go grind some of these things
2121600	2127600	so I can craft more Pokeballs. I like that. Like, I like that it's a little bit like you don't feel
2127600	2134720	like you haven't done anything if you spend an hour just catching more Bidoofs and getting
2134720	2139760	material needed for Pokeballs because you still have, you're going to need those Pokeballs later.
2139760	2143360	And you know what? You're going to have that full entry on Bidoof and your Poke decks.
2143360	2149120	So, um, I think that's, I think that's all really neat. I don't think the game is perfect. I'm
2149120	2154880	going to say, this is my biggest complaint about the game. It feels like a PlayStation 3 RPG.
2155680	2160880	This like, and I think that's what frustrates people time and time again with Nintendo and
2160880	2165920	especially Game Freak. Like you think Nintendo's, I mean, at least Breath of the Wild
2165920	2170720	felt very cutting edge. Game Freak is always really behind in their technological skills
2170720	2174800	and all this. Um, it just feels like you're playing something on the PlayStation 3. Now,
2175440	2180960	a good game is a good game, no matter what the graphics are. So does that really matter at the
2180960	2185920	end of the day? Not really, but it is still frustrating to see that potential. And when
2185920	2191440	you see those comments on Twitter from people that are like, Sony should buy Nintendo. So
2191440	2196480	Nintendo has to make PlayStation 5 games. That's where those comments come from.
2197360	2203920	Is the frustration on the PlayStation 5. I mean, that's, that is very true. Um,
2203920	2209680	is that you just, you see the potential for more with like, like I just said at the beginning,
2209680	2216560	it's 20, nobody knows how Arceus, Arceus, Arceus is pronounced. Well, I mean, you all have your
2216560	2221520	arguments, which is fine, but we don't really know because there's still no voice acting in
2221520	2226880	these games. And to be quite frankly, a lot of the text and everything feels a little bit like
2226880	2231520	a slog in the beginning of the game. But once you finally get into it, it is really rewarding. And
2231520	2237840	to be fair, and I think it's important to say, Pokemon Legends will still run in handheld mode.
2237840	2241760	And a lot of people are running it in handheld mode and for a handheld game,
2241760	2246560	it does look really good. So there is that. And if you are going to be playing exclusively in
2246560	2250800	handheld mode, then probably my PlayStation 3 comment isn't gonna, isn't gonna make a
2250800	2256400	lick of difference to you. But yeah, it is frustrating to see that potential really
2256400	2261600	lagging behind. Especially when you have games like Xenoblade Chronicles looking the way it
2261600	2266880	does on the same hardware. It's like, you could probably do a little better if you put a difference
2266880	2276400	to do behind it. But Game Freak gonna Game Freak. Chad Stars again chat says, no, we know how it's
2276400	2280480	pronounced. Sure. We know how Jiff is pronounced, but we all rejected that and said, no, it's GIF.
2280480	2284640	I mean, you know, it's, people are going to do what they're going to do. Language evolves.
2285680	2292320	Let's see. Jason in chat says, I've been thinking about buying Arceus thinking it might be the game
2292320	2298400	that gets me back into the series after I, after I tired, I'm tired of the mainline mechanics.
2298400	2303120	I would really, you know, not to, not to promote my own stream, but I would encourage you to check
2303120	2307840	out some YouTubes and streamers that are playing the game just to get a feel if it might be for you.
2308480	2311840	Because just reading your comment, if you're sick of the mainline mechanics,
2312560	2317600	this is a different game. Now, yes, you do do battling in this game, and it's actually kind
2317600	2322080	of hard. Like you can't really steamroll Pokemon just because you have a type advantage. They can
2322080	2326080	still do a decent amount of damage to you, and you'll feel like you're burning through potions.
2326080	2331200	But in a way, I feel like that feels a little more rewarding for having crafted those potions
2331200	2336480	in the first place than just my usual hoarder tendencies in a Pokemon game to just run right
2336480	2340560	back to a Poke Center and never have to touch a potion, except unless I'm in a gym battle or
2340560	2349840	something like that. So there is that as well. So. SSG100Matt in chat says, I don't give Nintendo
2349840	2354160	a hard time because they make these games fun. Nintendo had the biggest selling game last year,
2354160	2359040	Animal Crossing. That is not a big graphically demanding game and no real voice acting. Yeah,
2359040	2364960	fair point. And I didn't say, you know, again, I really like this game. It probably. I mean,
2364960	2368880	ask me after I've spent a few more hours in it. It's probably honestly probably going to be my
2368880	2374640	favorite Pokemon game. I feel like it's that much better than like even the mainline games and all
2374640	2379600	that. But let's say give me a few more hours just to really make sure on that point. But I'm not
2380560	2384720	I'm not saying I don't get frustrated that there's that potential to be even better
2384720	2390800	that is unrealized. But I guess this is the first in a series and hopefully the first in a series.
2390800	2394560	I don't after the critical reception this game's getting and I would imagine the sales have been
2394560	2399120	pretty good to just based on my social media. I don't see how they don't think about having
2399120	2404320	to do a follow up in one way or another to this series. Loki, you're going to say something?
2404880	2408560	Oh, no, I was going to say, yeah, even though the Animal Crossing was the best selling game,
2409600	2415680	and it has a simpler art style, doesn't mean that they didn't execute their art style flawlessly. I
2415680	2421280	mean, I think that there could have been a lot that they could have done to make that game look
2421280	2425760	better. It does look pretty rough around the edges. Not to say it's a bad playing game,
2425760	2429840	but it's like, and they kind of could have done a little bit more with this.
2430880	2434640	SSJ 100 Matt in chat says I was speaking towards the internet trolls who think that
2434640	2441360	Nintendo needs 4K gaming with all the P's. Well, it wouldn't hurt. And there is a part of me that
2441360	2447760	kind of wonders, was this game originally being made for a 4K switch and maybe we're seeing a
2447760	2454000	scaled down version of the graphical power? I hope not, because I would look terrible in 4K.
2454000	2460240	But what if we're not seeing the fully realized version? Because, I don't know.
2460640	2465120	Just a thought. Anyway, because even if you're into those art assets in the
2465120	2469680	low resolution, that still isn't changed how they have every the models and stuff in the game. It's
2469680	2475360	just, no, like, really, to me, what stands out is really cheaply done is the environments. The
2475360	2481600	environments to me look like, you know, it looks like stuff I would come up with in Unity, because
2481600	2486800	I have no experience in making environments that look organic. It would be the stuff I'd come up
2486800	2497360	with, unfortunately. And that's not a compliment. I think they could have done better. It just looks
2497360	2504480	old. It looks dated. Shad Starsick in chat says this is considered mainline and not spinoff,
2504480	2510080	so it could easily get another entry. Good. However, y'all want to spin it with a different
2510080	2515280	series of things. I think that this definitely deserves another entry. I would far rather see
2515280	2519040	another game in this series than in the Let's Go series, which I would imagine at this point is
2519040	2524400	probably done. And I can also say I've already put more hours into this, Pokemon Legends, than I did
2524400	2529280	Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl. That one kind of wore off after, like, just a few hours. I think I
2529280	2533840	got maybe to the second gym and I was already over it. And maybe I'll go back at some point,
2533840	2537920	maybe when they put in the home integration or something, but as of right now, I don't even care
2537920	2543840	about that anymore. I just want to play Pokemon Legends when it comes to that. So. Fifth Dream
2543840	2549040	in chat says, everyone, I love Breath of the Wild. Everyone. PLA, Pokemon Legends Arceus,
2549040	2554880	looks like Breath of the Wild. Everyone. PLA looks like shit. I get that line of thinking,
2554880	2559760	but I'm going to be very clear. Breath of the Wild is a far better looking game than this.
2560640	2567920	But that's not to say this is bad. It's just, it's PlayStation 3 good. It's not really pushing
2567920	2572720	the envelope graphically or anything like that. So, and Breath of the Wild was a better looking
2572720	2579360	game. But this has, this has that sort of style to it. And again, I think we're having a lot of
2579360	2584080	arguments and stuff about the things that are wrong with it. There's a lot that's really right
2584080	2588960	with it. I really like that there's multiple ways to catch Pokemon. You want to battle them the more
2588960	2592880	traditional way, wear them down. Great. You want to stealth and bonk them in the back of the head
2592880	2597200	with a Poke Ball and catch them that way. Great. Like, I like that there's different ways to do
2597200	2600560	things. You can use items, and that's very reminiscent of Breath of the Wild too, to,
2600560	2605440	like, distract Pokemon, like start a fire over here, not really in Pokemon, but you throw a
2605440	2609680	smoke bomb or something, distract the Pokemon and then, you know, do it that way. I like that
2609680	2614960	there's many different ways to approach a problem. And I think that's kind of cool. So there's a lot
2614960	2622640	of, there's a lot of great things about the game. And the graphics just aren't one of them. And
2622640	2629680	that's, that's okay. I just hope that if they do continue to invest in Legends, which they should,
2629760	2635200	and I don't know if that means some of these concepts show up in Gen 9. That's still a little
2635200	2638960	weird to me how that would work, because then I feel, I feel like there's got to be Pokemon people
2638960	2643600	out there that don't want to see a lot of this stuff come to the mainline games, because the
2643600	2649840	mainline games kind of exist as an RPG only. So I don't know how that ends up working or whatever,
2649840	2655120	but I feel like there's got to be a place for this Legends formula. I also understand maybe
2655120	2660400	they don't want to do like a historical thing for every generation, although somebody planted
2660400	2667280	that idea in my head about a medieval game for the Sword and Shield generation, which I think
2667280	2673280	would be pretty cool. But just, just the way this game works in, you know, the Pokemon context.
2673280	2674080	I hope they do something.
2674080	2680320	Pokemon Assassin's Creed. The different, different timelines.
2680320	2680880	Yeah.
2680880	2681760	For reasons.
2682480	2686800	Uh, let's see. ST-100 Matt says, we'll see how that Breath of the Sonic the Hedgehog goes.
2686800	2691680	I'm curious about that one. That's for sure. Um, Mike Def says, I think Game Freak and the
2691680	2696240	Pokemon company have gone on record to say that they're done with Let's Go, but don't quote me
2696240	2703600	on that. I just see that. I like that game. I didn't hate it, but it's very reductive with the
2703600	2709120	other remakes they're doing. And I think I completely understand the argument that like,
2709120	2714800	how many times do we have to redo gen one, like let the series do their gen five remake
2714800	2721520	or whatever. But I'm, I'm just, I'm far more interested now in what's the next legends type
2721520	2725440	game going to be like, that's, that's where you're going to get my most interest at this point,
2725440	2731040	even more so than gen nine, to be quite honest. So there's a cute little crossover event in
2731040	2738560	Pokemon Go. You can catch the little, um, Hoi San, um, Voltorbs in the, um, let's in, uh,
2738560	2744400	Pokemon Go right now. So I thought that's really cute. So, all right. That was my gaming week.
2744400	2748640	I talked a lot about that game, but I know it's been a lot of people's gaming weeks. So, uh,
2748640	2752480	you know, we had to talk about it a little bit, but I dev again, if you're on the fence about it,
2753040	2757280	check out some let's plays, check out some YouTubes and stuff because, um, you're going
2757280	2761840	to see, it's a very different type of Pokemon game. And I think it might fix some of the issues
2761840	2768880	that felt very repetitive sometimes in the mainline games. So, all right, let's move on.
2768880	2773440	We're going to get into some news first. I want to remind you, there is no show on February 20th.
2773440	2777840	That's a few weeks from now, but just a reminder, there's not going to be a live show or a podcast
2777840	2783280	that week. I'm moving. So, uh, we'll have what we'll have 9 0 2 9 0 3, and then there's going
2783280	2788320	to be a break. And then when 9 0 4 shows up, it's going to look different because, uh, my whole set
2788320	2792240	up at the new place is going to be different. So that'll be fun. Hopefully I'll be at a place where
2792240	2795920	dark soccer and Loki can actually see my webcam now. Cause I don't know if you guys know this,
2795920	2800640	they can't see me. I can see them, but they can't see me. So like, if I were to do something like
2800640	2806640	this, that's all right, Rob, they can't see it. So, uh, but in the delay, it's fun. Oh,
2806640	2812240	you see me on a delay. Okay. Um, but in the new set up, I'm actually hoping I have a way to fix
2812240	2820080	that. So, uh, stay tuned. Anyway. Um, let's move on, get into some news and, uh, boy. Oh boy,
2820080	2825360	Loki. This is, this is a fun one to start with tonight. The viewers at home. I just want you
2825360	2829520	to know that my eyes rolling back in my head, it's not me dying or having a stroke is just,
2829520	2838240	this is just as stupid as possible. Um, so Tari celebrated their 50 years of making games, except
2838240	2842800	they haven't been making games for quite a long time, but sure. You know, they've been around
2842800	2852640	for awhile. So what's the best way to do that? Well, of course, NFTs, but not just NFTs. Oh no,
2853280	2858720	that we can't possibly just do one thing that people hate, but we're also going to do NFT
2858720	2865120	loot boxes. That's right. Two things that people hate rolled in the one and they call them GFTs
2865120	2876320	like digital gifts. Aren't they already digital? Yes. So GFTs are like hallmark cards for the next
2876320	2883520	generation. That's funny because no one really cares about cards either. They're kind of for
2883520	2891520	yourself. I don't care about cards. Um, and, uh, apparently, you know, rather than being
2891520	2897840	some small predictable token, um, GFTs are governed by a loot table with predetermined
2897840	2907040	random rates. Um, now what exactly is in these? I have no idea. I mean, it looks like it's just some
2908240	2914880	10 images inspired by the gaming past of the company. Um,
2914880	2924400	um, yeah, not really worth it. If you ask me, I'm not sure how much these are going for, but
2926000	2931760	not buying them. Now, Mike Defton chat points out, curiously enough, NFT loot boxes already
2931760	2938320	exist. Yes. Um, this isn't the first way it's been implemented, but, um, I, you know, it's,
2938320	2944160	it's two bad ideas. Uh, you know, NFTs, we already have talked about that and now it's
2944160	2947760	loot boxes on top of that. It's just like to make a bad thing and make it even worse.
2948320	2953360	Um, but boy, Atari sure seems to be wanting to find the money wherever they can get it.
2953360	2960000	Huh? Yeah. So basically it contains one of 10 images and two of those images are the epic
2960000	2974400	rarity. It's just, I don't know. I was just so stupid. I'm sorry. Like, cause I just,
2976240	2980320	where's the, like, I get it. There's a speculative market for this stuff right now, but like
2981200	2986560	when that goes away, like no one's going to care about those stuff. It's not probably very good
2986560	2993840	art anyways. It's just your pain. It's like stamp collecting, I guess. At least that you have,
2993840	3001920	you know, physical PC can trade. You would think for their 50th anniversary,
3001920	3006640	Atari would have something a little more, I don't know, like something to celebrate. I mean,
3006640	3011680	since they keep relying on that seventies collection, like you would think that they
3011680	3015840	would have like a, a definitive Atari collection or something. I mean, I guess they have the
3015840	3020480	flashback consoles. They did have that Atari. I don't know. There's like volume one, two,
3020480	3024800	three that was on like PlayStation four and Xbox one, not that long ago. They have that they're
3024800	3030400	they're sad little PC, the ant stream deal, which kind of seems to be, you know, another big place
3030400	3033200	where they exist right now. But I don't know. I would have thought that they'd have something,
3033200	3036800	I guess, arcade one up machines too. Maybe there'll be a 50th anniversary,
3036800	3040560	Atari arcade one up or something. I don't know. I just wouldn't have thought that there were other
3040640	3047840	places to sort of celebrate 50 years, which is a pretty big milestone. Other than fricking NFT and,
3047840	3052960	and things that, you know, most people are not even going to know what they are. So it's just,
3052960	3059840	it's silly. Yeah. And this is being brought to us, I guess, by Republic realm who's sold NFTs
3059840	3069680	in the past. They sold a picture or it's like, I guess, a 3d model of a quote unquote yacht.
3070720	3075600	It just looks like once again, comparing it to my terrible skills, it looks like something I
3075600	3081920	would model in a 3d program within a time limit of 15 minutes to in time in a yacht.
3081920	3087680	It looks more like an aircraft carrier if you ask me, but yeah, they sold it for
3088240	3098400	149 Ethereum or $650,000. It's just why there are people out in this world
3099200	3106400	that have so much money and are so stupid. Well, a lot of these like logically thinking it through,
3106400	3111520	like if you really want to be like, how did somebody spend this much money? My guess is
3112160	3116720	because it's somebody that's embracing this whole NFT thing and getting in on it early.
3116720	3122480	They were probably the type that got in on Bitcoin or Ethereum or any of that stuff relatively early.
3122480	3128640	So probably at a low value, they accumulated quite a bit of that type of coin. And now,
3128640	3134320	because their perception of what is money is probably very warped by coming into a lot of
3134320	3139840	money very quickly, it doesn't feel like as much money as it does to you and me.
3139840	3142960	Like logically, that's where I really think somebody ends up spending this kind of money
3142960	3148080	on this type of situation. Now they have to convince everybody else. It's because this is
3148080	3154160	the thing. What is 600 Ethereum to you that is apparently now like, I'm sorry, 50,000 or whatever
3154160	3159680	it was to the rest of us, you have to be able to, and that's why you see all this real pointed
3159680	3164480	language and stuff on social media and all this stuff, because they're trying to convince people
3164480	3170320	that their money is worth what apparently it's supposed to be and none of us believe it.
3170320	3179360	I just, like, even if this, even if they were trying to sell this for $1.49 and not $650,000,
3180480	3187040	it's not even worth that. Like, it's just, it's just garbage. Like, I don't, whatever, I guess,
3187040	3193040	you know, some day down the road, you're going to think about, you know, that guy that bought,
3193040	3197360	you know, pizza with Bitcoin and spent like, I don't remember how many, what the equivalent
3197360	3201520	of millions of dollars in today's money that that would have been worth, but it, this is
3201520	3207920	essentially that you're buying garbage for something that Ethereum could be worth like a
3207920	3212080	ton of money, like in the future. I mean, it's already worth pretty, you know, quite a bit,
3212080	3220480	but like even more so I just, whatever, I guess I'm just one of those, those gamers. It just
3220480	3225520	doesn't get it. DJ Rama S in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says,
3225520	3230480	a wise man once said a fool and their money are soon parted. There's a lot of,
3230480	3236240	a lot of modern things to read into with that for sure. I was going to say forgiveness is divine,
3236240	3242000	but never pay full price for a late pizza. E3 VL in chat says it's, you get it, right?
3242000	3247680	E3 VL in chat says it's like pogs back in the day. I thought it was worth a lot back in the day. Now
3247680	3252080	it's worth nothing. Well, you know what? I also kind of put in that bin and I know this is gonna,
3252080	3257520	this is gonna ruffle some people's feathers. I put things like magic cards and baseball cards
3257520	3262320	and not that I'm comparing those to NFTs. I'm talking about like what the value is to some
3262320	3267920	people. When I was in high school, sold magic cards. Oh, is that, oh, that's exactly where I
3267920	3272240	was going is that, you know, magic's been around since I was in high school, not to date magic or
3272240	3277360	myself, but that is it. So I sold my first deck of magic, the gathering cards, because I was over it.
3277440	3281760	First deck of magic, the gathering cards, because I was over it and I sold it to a friend for 35
3281760	3287280	bucks. I'm probably like that guy who bought the pizza for a million dollars in Bitcoin today.
3287280	3293840	There probably was shit in that deck that is now worth money to somebody in that deck today. But
3293840	3300480	to me, I was over it. It wasn't worth anything anymore. And so am I upset about it? No, it was
3300480	3305440	because I don't, you can't sell those cards to just anybody. You've got to convince somebody
3305520	3309760	that, you know, rare printing with the black border, sorry, I have a hard time speaking
3309760	3313200	the language because it's been so long. You have to convince people that it's worth that kind of
3313200	3318800	money. And to certain people it is. And a lot though, like if you're talking about like
3318800	3326240	traditional artwork, like these like paintings that go for a lot of money are typically from
3326240	3333280	like very famous artists that have, you know, reputation or quality of work to them that are
3333280	3339360	sought after. And that's why those pieces are worth so much. I don't know who this person is
3339360	3344960	that drew some, some apes on the internet and made like, I don't know how many hundreds of them like
3346160	3350160	that literally means nothing to me. Like, and I don't understand why they're going for so much,
3350160	3355360	but then you have like celebrities, like, you know, Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton
3357280	3361920	going on their shows and saying, Oh look, I identify with this eight because I wear a
3361920	3368080	striped shirt as well sometimes. And it gets normalized in this sense, but I think a lot of
3368080	3371360	people are just kind of rolling their eyes. Like, I don't get this. It doesn't make any sense. And
3371360	3375760	it it's, it's not that we don't understand how commerce works and how like, you know,
3375760	3384880	Oh, this is going to be worth something, but it's not like, you know, if I have a piece of art,
3384880	3389760	you know, a Rembrandt or something like that, and I have it hanging in my house,
3389760	3399200	that is a piece of art that I have. Whereas, you know, if it's an NFT, someone can literally go
3399200	3406880	get an exact copy of that. And in like, it's pretty much effortless. It's, there's no uniqueness
3406880	3416320	to it aside from what a blockchain says, you own this. Okay. It means nothing. It really does.
3416320	3421440	And it's not even like you own the rights to anything. It's just like,
3422960	3429520	it, it's, it's silly. It's, it's, I think trying to find more utility for blockchain technology,
3429520	3435920	which I think that there is, you know, possible uses for blockchain, but like NFTs, I just think,
3437200	3440000	I don't know. I just think that they're really trying to make it work.
3440640	3444560	But why put so much effort into something like this when we could have
3445200	3447920	say improved quantum computing for home use?
3450560	3453840	Whatever happened to using your computing power for folding at home
3453840	3456960	as opposed to Bitcoin mining, right?
3459120	3464800	And if they're worried about security, nevermind. I could get completely started on.
3464800	3472400	All right. To, to be fair, I'm done talking about those no fucking time things.
3472400	3475760	We always say we're done and then more shit happens.
3475760	3481280	Because it's the gaming industry because the gaming industry won't shut up about it. You know,
3481280	3485200	this is the show about video games and gaming culture and whether we like it or not,
3485200	3489920	this is showing up and it's because these executives are convinced they are missing
3490480	3493360	the million dollar Bitcoin pizza or whatever the fuck it is.
3493360	3496640	If they don't get their companies in on this, I just want pizza now.
3496640	3501600	I know it doesn't really good, doesn't it? All right. Well, let's move on and let's talk about,
3501600	3506080	Hey, what I think is actually a good idea in the game industry and one that now a lot of
3506080	3510720	people are trying to compete with in their own way. It's Microsoft game pass, right?
3510720	3516240	So interesting enough game pass. I never really realized this, but there's probably a lot of
3516240	3521040	people who buy game pass and then never use it. Kind of like a gym membership. And, you know,
3521600	3525920	Microsoft has these things on auto renewal because you know, that's how gyms make their money.
3525920	3531120	Yeah. People who have a gym membership and then never go. Right. Well, interesting because thanks
3531120	3538720	to a recent settlement in the UK, basically. They're going to be making some changes to the
3538720	3543040	way Xbox live gold and game pass. Microsoft is going to be making a change to this.
3543040	3549520	So if you have not used Xbox live gold or game pass in a year, you're going to get in touch.
3549680	3552880	Basically Microsoft's going to send you an email or something and say, this is how you stop your
3552880	3560880	payments if you want to opt out. But if you keep doing it over another 12 months, so two years,
3560880	3566880	Microsoft stops taking payments. Now, well, Microsoft isn't quite doing this out of the
3566880	3571040	goodness in their hearts. They're having to do it to the UK consumers first because
3572000	3577200	this is a agreement with the competition and markets authority or the CMA in the UK.
3577840	3583360	However, now where you can say good guy Microsoft is that there's no reason for them to roll this
3583360	3587120	outside the UK, but they are going to roll it out to the rest of the world.
3587920	3592640	Perhaps they fear that similar things would have come down the pipeline, who knows, but that is
3592640	3598000	something that they are doing. So again, UK first and in an interview with the verge, Microsoft said
3598000	3602800	it will be rolled out globally in the near future. Although of course we don't know exactly when that
3602800	3609360	is. Also we do not know how auto renewing systems on the switch or PlayStation plus or any of that
3609360	3615440	will have to respond. Microsoft has also agreed to have better upfront information about the
3615440	3620240	memberships, meaning basically like it's very clear that this is not a renewal when your
3620240	3624400	subscription is going to be renewed and how much you're going to pay and how to get a refund. So
3624400	3630240	they have to kind of give all that information upfront. The CMA's executive director of
3630240	3635760	enforcement Michael Grenfell said, quote, gamers need to be given clear and timely information
3635760	3639680	to make informed choices when signing up for auto renewing memberships and subscriptions.
3640720	3645680	We are therefore pleased that Microsoft has given the CMA these formal undertakings to improve the
3645680	3650880	fairness of their practices and protect consumers and will be offering refunds to certain customers.
3651440	3656400	Very interesting. So it's interesting that the rest of the world is kind of benefiting from that too.
3656400	3661040	So if you've been too lazy to go and cancel your Microsoft game pass because you're not using it,
3661680	3667920	well, in two years, you don't have to do it. It'll be done for you. But I also would say
3668720	3672880	if you kind of, if you're paying for game pass and you're not using it, you're kind of missing out.
3672880	3678720	Like there's, there's gotta be at least one free game on there you want to play. So over to our
3678720	3684480	chat at twitch.tv slash vog network. Mike Deff says, I feel guilty of that. Barely using my
3684480	3689440	game pass sub. You didn't even play the new Taiko no Tatujin? Soon, I'm sure. Keep in mind,
3689440	3693280	you only have to use it once in two years. And then they're, you know, they're going to consider
3693280	3698240	that you're using it. S2 under Matt says, it's just avoiding lawsuits from the consumer protection
3698240	3704000	agencies, which is who MS made a deal with in the UK to avoid a lawsuit. Just makes sense. A
3704000	3709600	simple email takes the onus off of them. And Zen Monkey 11 says, I'm glad the UK stepped up. Like
3709600	3714240	a year ago, I had game pass. I forgot to unsubscribe before the auto-renewal. Microsoft
3714240	3720320	hunted me down for their 15 bucks. I couldn't get PC game pass until I paid them. Oh, that's well,
3720320	3726640	that's how the gym memberships and all that work too. So interesting, interesting. All right,
3726640	3736480	let's move on. Dark Sakura. Well, how about, uh, something else online, but it's, it's, uh, it's
3737040	3743840	not Xbox or anything about that. It's Netflix. Um, Netflix is going to be expanding their
3743840	3750640	game library. They're working with a Canadian game agency called rock ride game, rocket ride games
3751440	3758960	to do that expansion. Um, they will be able to play some mobile games, uh, with the partnership,
3758960	3766080	um, to the games that are, uh, available, um, already are on, this is on the Netflix app is
3766080	3775960	Domino's cafe and mittens, K N I T T E N S, um, both added in December from rocket ride. Um,
3776560	3782000	and there are more games coming out. Netflix is saying no ads, no in-app purchases. They're
3782000	3787520	included standard with your Netflix subscription to promote the service. Um,
3788960	3794240	and, uh, it looks like rocket ride has been making a decent amount of money with, you know,
3794240	3802240	similar deals like this. And they're really happy about working with Netflix. Um, the, uh, Netflix
3802240	3809680	games app was released, um, well, at least for the Google app store in the UK on November 2nd,
3809680	3817280	uh, last year and had two stranger things games. So do you want to try?
3820320	3825600	Uh, I haven't yet, but, um, I like that Netflix is trying to sweeten the pot a little bit. I
3825600	3830560	like the fact that it's, you know, gaming and, you know, other, uh, like movies and TV shows
3830560	3836400	and things like that. So, but otherwise I had to take out the stuff for dead by daylight.
3836400	3841840	Oh, well, yeah. I found myself missing the Hawkins laboratory, Rob.
3842880	3846720	What's the world come to? Yeah, but I think that crows map is pretty good.
3846720	3854560	So I'm glad you think so. All right. Here, let's move on to another story. Uh, that, uh,
3854560	3859280	has been weeks and weeks long, but, uh, important. And I think, uh, definitely will be the future of
3859280	3864560	our industry. Loki. Yeah. You would think that the tune would change being that they're going
3864560	3869520	to be purchased by Microsoft here pretty soon, but apparently Activision blizzard has called for
3870080	3879600	a studio wide vote after they refuse to, uh, recognize the union from, uh, Raven QA staff.
3879600	3887440	Uh, so they're going to have to have everybody vote kind of, um, I think it's probably to delay
3887440	3895360	this from happening. Um, so now, um, the whole company has to vote on whether they should
3895360	3903600	recognize the union. Um, and then of course, uh, the staff at, or the QA testers at Raven
3903600	3910240	have ended their strike, um, following their announcement of the union that they developed.
3910240	3916720	So, um, that's good, but I mean, I think they're probably going to wait and see if it's actually
3916720	3923280	being recognized by the company, but I'm just surprised that they're willing to do this after.
3924960	3928320	I mean, I guess any company is looking to squash unions, but.
3930720	3934640	Yeah, I'm a little surprised they don't see the writing on the wall, but this is completely
3934640	3939360	unsurprising of the current powers that be at Activision either to, you know, basically be
3939360	3944320	like, well, we're not going to recognize it, but, um, I mean, we'll see what happens after the vote,
3944320	3949440	but, um, it'll be interesting. Uh, I, I think it's interesting. They're under their strike too,
3949440	3954160	but I also get that like union is like where they want to end up. And ultimately I think where the
3954160	3959440	game industry is going to end up. So I, I think, I think this is all a process. There's just going
3959440	3963760	to play out over the next few years. And then eventually you're going to see a lot more game
3963760	3968400	workers that are unionized and, uh, the more and more of them to get there, the more lucrative
3968400	3972880	those companies are going to be to work for. Especially when they see how, you know,
3972880	3977920	this works out for them. I mean, if it ends up working out for that QA team, then yeah,
3977920	3982160	I think you could have more people in the other departments following suit. Yeah, for sure.
3983440	3989200	Uh, well, meanwhile, at another troubled company, uh, Ubisoft, um, some news that I don't think is
3989200	3993360	very surprising to folks who followed this game because there weren't a lot of folks following
3993360	3999120	this game, but hyperscape is going to be shut down on April 28th. That game didn't come out
3999120	4003280	that long ago. If I remember right. Uh, that was the one that was like, it was more like,
4003280	4006720	like it was trying to capture the battle royale thing where I was kind of like apex legends,
4006720	4010080	that sort of thing, but they were trying to do more with like anti-gravity vertical
4010080	4015600	type of stuff. That was, that was the whole thing on hyperscape. So, um, Ubisoft and announcement
4015600	4019600	said, quote, we set out to create a vertical close quarters and fast paced shooter experience.
4019600	4022880	We are extremely grateful to our community for joining us on our journey. We will be
4022880	4028400	taking key learnings from this game into future products. So it'd be interesting, um, what that
4028400	4032320	could possibly mean. If maybe you see a mode like this show up in another game or something,
4032320	4037600	I don't know. The game just came out in summer of 2020. So it didn't even last a year. In fact,
4037600	4042000	less than a year before they announced that they were going to pull the plug, um, start to finish.
4042000	4046160	So that's, uh, that's pretty scary. The, uh, amount of life it was on that. But again,
4046160	4050480	to have a battle royale be successful, you have to have a lot of people that are playing it or
4050480	4056880	else it can't find the people to do a new match. So I think that's probably a big part of the
4056880	4062880	problem. Um, anyway, so Ubisoft did admit the hyperscape didn't fully meet the high expectations
4062880	4068480	of our players. Um, and, uh, I think it's because the game was kind of a mess when it came out. So,
4068480	4073840	uh, I don't know. Uh, anyway, uh, apparently, uh, Ubisoft may still be trying to do battle
4073840	4078960	royale in other games. And so again, this might be something that you see in other titles that they
4078960	4083680	do, uh, such as ghost recon frontline. Apparently there's going to be one new game in the genre
4083680	4088560	there. And, uh, the division heartland is also supposed to have a battle royale mode as well. So
4088560	4093200	maybe they'll have more success in an established franchise than trying to do a franchise of their
4093200	4098240	own. But, uh, no, it's not necessarily that they're blaming their consumers again, but it
4098240	4102320	kind of almost the way they phrase that, like it didn't meet the high expectations of our,
4102320	4108800	of our gamers or consumers. It's like your expectations were just set too high. You just
4108800	4114400	don't get it. Well, yeah. And, but I think people would also call them out on that because the game
4114400	4118560	had its issues. I know, I know. I know that's not the way that they meant it, but like coming after
4118560	4124800	the whole NFT thing, it's like, guys are just, you're just not in tune with us. Okay. It was
4124800	4130320	only supposed to be at this level. Uh, I don't know. Uh, Zen monkey 11 in chat says that's why
4130320	4135920	I hate all these online only games. They come and go within months. Fuck that. Not Fortnite,
4135920	4142640	not pub G, not apex. So, I mean, I get it. I totally get what you're saying because you always
4142640	4147200	inevitably the, all these games are trying to be that and emulate that for other companies.
4147200	4151920	And sometimes they work. Sometimes they don't. It's to me, it's very similar with world of
4151920	4156640	Warcraft. When world of Warcraft hit its all time high, you know, around wrath of the Lich King,
4157280	4165840	how many MMOs did we see come out that just flopped within months? I mean, shit, it almost
4165840	4171760	looks like new world is headed a similar way. Is that like new world was huge for like 15 days.
4172880	4177360	And now it's like, you know, but that's not to say every MMO has flopped. Certainly,
4177360	4181280	I found fancy 14, which maybe I'm a little biased, but I think most can see that that
4181280	4184800	one's done well. And there's other ones as well that have hung in there. I mean, shit,
4184800	4189760	EverQuest is still going after all these years. So, you know, there, there are other good MMOs,
4189760	4194800	but I just feel like whenever there's a good thing in gaming, everybody wants to emulate
4194800	4201280	it somehow. Minecraft, right? How many crafting and those types of retro inspired graphic games
4201280	4205440	do we see now? A ton. How many of them are successful? Little different there because
4205440	4211680	the multiplayer environment and the always online isn't as necessary with that. But certainly we've
4211680	4217680	seen a lot of that. So Mike Deaf says, at least we got some Twitch emotes for that game. I wonder
4217680	4222960	if those will stick around. That's for sure. Quest Buster saying there's a rumor floating
4222960	4227200	around that battlefield 2042 might go free to play because it's performing so badly. Oh,
4227200	4233120	that would be very interesting. Ziba SA points out Final Fantasy 11 still going after all these years
4233120	4238000	too. Oh, absolutely. And it, you know, it blows my mind. They still don't have like a free to play
4238000	4242640	model or that, but they're still making updates to that game, even though the mobile version of
4242640	4249040	that sure disappeared. And Jason points out quite simply, yes, wherever there is success, everyone
4249040	4255440	wants to emulate it. Look at all these NFT stories we're talking because somebody heard that a
4255440	4261040	procedurally generated monkey sold for thousands of dollars. And now everybody wants a piece of
4261040	4266400	that money. It's just wild. They saw how easy it was. They saw how easy it was. And now, well,
4266400	4271680	and look at, look at Konami. Konami should have never made the kind of money they did
4271680	4276960	on that Castlevania stuff. But here we are. They did. And now Atari is like, oh shit,
4276960	4280800	we got a retro collection we can tap into too. And this is, it's just going to be cause that's
4280800	4284480	all the investors are going to see are dollar signs and look at all these idiots on the
4284480	4288240	internet with all this money, all this money that they don't know how to spend.
4288240	4296000	Anyway. All right, let's move on. Dark Soccer, I believe you're next.
4296000	4304320	Well, Nintendo is of course very protective and very greedy with their IPs,
4305280	4311360	with any of their properties. And there is a popular video game music channel
4311680	4323840	called a Gilva Sonner. And they've actually targeted them before, but now they
4325280	4335280	have been hit with 1300 takedowns for so many different soundtracks, you know, Smash Brothers
4335280	4343120	and various Mario games and Legend of Zelda games. And so the, the owner of this site,
4343120	4348000	I'll just read the quote. I see a lot of assumptions being made by some of you with
4348000	4353360	some extreme words against me. Let me clarify again that I do not monetize videos and do not
4353360	4359120	profit from them. I do realize that doesn't justify uploading the content. I'm also not angry
4359120	4363920	or surprised that Nintendo is doing this, but I do think it's a bit disappointing. There's hardly
4363920	4369120	an alternative. If Nintendo thinks this is what needs to be done to set an example, I will let
4369120	4377840	them take down the channel. It is their content after all. I like the most. Oh, go ahead. Please.
4377840	4381760	You know, I was going to say, I was going to say, you know what makes me most surprised about this
4381760	4389920	is like, I see like constantly people using Nintendo music in their live streams, in their
4389920	4400480	videos, like egregiously. And I would think that like, I would be most wary of using Nintendo
4400480	4408960	licensed anything in any of my videos because they are so litigious, happy. Just I'm just,
4408960	4417520	I'm shocked it took this long. I did a series of five to 10 videos on retro games for my personal
4417520	4421280	YouTube channel back in like, it was a while ago. I was in the old apartments. It was probably like
4421280	4428320	2000, but I was with Allen. So it was probably like 2011, 2012. I did these videos and one of
4428320	4432160	them was about the Legend of Zelda and I'm talking and I'm doing all this stuff, but yeah, the
4432160	4437280	Nintendo music is there because I'm playing Legend of Zelda. Oh, Nintendo copyright claimed it like
4437280	4442000	that. I don't particularly care because I'm not really in the business to make money. But I
4442000	4446160	thought that was very interesting. That was like, all right, well, I guess, okay. Nintendo is very
4446160	4452000	much like nobody's profiting off this, but us. But I also understand it is their game, whatever.
4453440	4459200	I like, at least in this story, I feel like the content or it feels weird to say content creator
4459200	4463120	because they're not really creating anything, but I would say the YouTube channel owner.
4464160	4470240	I think they have a measured approach. They get it. They're like, I just want a way to listen
4470240	4475040	to Nintendo music. And I get it is Nintendo's music. If they want to take it down, okay.
4475040	4480080	But why it, and I get it, it frustrates them as I think it frustrates a lot of us.
4480080	4485760	There isn't another way to just listen to Nintendo jams. However, Nintendo wants to make that money.
4485760	4490080	I think there's that frustration because we see Nintendo copyright claiming a lot of this shit
4491600	4497760	to hold onto it and be like, you know, my precious and not do anything with it, but hold it in their
4497760	4503600	hand. And that's what frustrates people. And what's also frustrating about it is that Nintendo
4503600	4508720	is perfectly within their rights to do that. But that doesn't mean people aren't going to find
4508720	4515680	other ways to listen to, you know, these epic timeless songs from Metroid, Zelda, Mario,
4515680	4522400	and so forth as they need to. I mean, every streaming service out there, you name it,
4522400	4527520	has at least like orchestral versions, covers, remixes, and things that are a lot harder for
4527520	4533520	Nintendo to touch. But yeah, the originals, it's really, really, they just, they don't want that
4533520	4537440	for whatever reason. Quest Buster in chat says, to be honest, I'm surprised it took
4537440	4543200	this long. Kind of same. Also, I wish Nintendo gave us more options to actually buy their music.
4543200	4549520	Yes. And that's what I'm hearing in the YouTube channel owner's comments. That's what the
4549520	4554000	frustration is. At least put the music up on streaming services then, or if you think the
4554000	4560080	streaming services don't pay enough, you know what? Put it on a part of the Nintendo online
4560080	4566960	subscription, a Nintendo music player. Oh my God, what a novel idea. Okay, sure. It's going to take
4566960	4571440	a little bit of development time to build that, but you know what? I don't think it would take
4571440	4575520	a ton and there's going to be a lot of people that would be super into that. How many of you
4575520	4582160	would be down for a Nintendo music player as a part of your online Switch membership?
4582240	4585680	Technically, they've already kind of got one in Smash Brothers. I mean,
4585680	4591200	yes, I see Bobby Blackwell pointing that out, but y'all know that's a little different because A,
4592000	4599200	it's not really, it's a very comprehensive, but it's not all encompassing. And B, it is kind of
4599200	4604880	buried away in the game, but I get it. I get it. Yes, there is a lot of the music in Smash
4604880	4610080	Brothers. Why don't they take that out and put it on Nintendo online? I don't know.
4610080	4616800	I would take forethought and they're not going to do that. I don't know. Artificial scarcity.
4617360	4621440	DJ Rama S in chat says, the problem is that Japanese and American copyright laws are very
4621440	4625920	different. Japanese companies don't really care about the American laws and YouTube will comply.
4625920	4631280	Toei hit a YouTuber with over 150 takedowns a few weeks ago. The YouTuber won his appeal,
4631280	4636960	but Toei has now stated, you are not allowed to use their anime for any use whatsoever.
4636960	4642880	Interesting. Jason says, game music is very prolific in Japan. RAA and America's
4642880	4648000	copyright laws are way more stringent. Hell, game OST CDs can actually be bought in Japan.
4648000	4652720	I feel like we're seeing more and more Japanese companies kind of get on the streaming services
4652720	4657280	though. I feel like in our rapid fire news segment, at least once, if not twice a month,
4657280	4663200	we're talking about some CD collection, some collection just came out. Namco put a bunch
4663200	4668400	of music up. Capcom put a bunch of music up on. Apple Music, Spotify, blah, blah, blah. You name
4668400	4676400	it. It's all there. So it's just, it's interesting to me that Nintendo, again, holds onto their
4676400	4683440	precious. So yeah, FitDream says, Squeenix has a lot on Spotify. Honestly, I think that's just
4683440	4688800	everywhere. You insert name of streaming service here. It's there. So it took a while to get there,
4688800	4694640	but it's there. That's for sure. All right, moving on. Loki, I think you're next.
4696480	4701680	All right. So the Steam Deck has some cool stuff coming through.
4701680	4703760	No. No.
4704400	4704900	What?
4705360	4706000	Nevermind.
4706880	4707380	Yes.
4707380	4708240	I'm wrong.
4708240	4709040	Yes. No.
4709040	4711200	She's really not liking the Steam Deck.
4711200	4717760	No, I'm just completely, because you guys talk so much over my, about what I-
4717760	4720640	No, no, no. I completely understand. This is-
4720640	4721140	Wait off.
4722000	4728880	No, this is the whole reason why it's good to have your products named in very distinct manners.
4728880	4739040	Anyways, the Steam Deck, the Valve portable console PC, they're going to be having cloud
4739040	4744160	saving for the Steam Deck, which I kind of figured that it would because, you know,
4744160	4749600	Steam has cloud saves, so why wouldn't this have cloud saves? But I guess that they're
4749600	4753840	doing something special with it called Cloud Dynamic Sync, which is supposed to
4755920	4760800	be a little bit better. It's supposed to automatically upload all modified save game
4760800	4768080	data to the cloud prior to the device entering sleep mode. So it's cloud saves, but quicker.
4768640	4772800	Sure. And then, of course, the Steam Deck is actually going to start rolling out
4774480	4782000	on February 25th. So you can start ordering that soon. When will you get them?
4782560	4787760	You don't know. At some point. It'll be out eventually.
4790240	4795760	Well, you kind of get to find out about when you're getting one, right? Like,
4795760	4799920	didn't they tell people, like, you'll get one, you know, in the quarter three?
4799920	4802960	I thought they already had the orders. Why they already did pre-orders for this?
4805040	4808160	Are they going to start shipping them out? Because it says you should start ordering
4808160	4812240	them February 25th. Yeah, they're shipping them out now, is the big thing.
4812240	4816160	Oh, I guess the order emails to reservation holders.
4818080	4824640	Yes. I guess that's something separate to pre-order.
4825040	4828640	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is what it is. They're sending out emails to the people
4828640	4833680	that reserved it. And the email basically says, hi, you reserved this. Now you can pay the remainder
4833680	4838560	of the amount or moving on to the next person on the list. That's what it is. But they paid like
4838560	4844000	five bucks to hold it. It isn't that dissimilar from what I think GameStop has done historically
4844000	4848240	with pre-orders. You pay $5 to pre-order the game or whatever, and then they'll call you,
4848240	4851600	they'll call you, but there's only so long they're going to call you before they move down to the
4851600	4857200	next person on the list. And so that's what this is going on with Steam. People already ordered
4857200	4861520	this some time ago, and I guess you could still go order one if you want, but it's going to take
4861520	4869040	some time to get there. But we finally know that they are actually coming out because this has
4869040	4874480	been delayed already. It was supposed to be a holiday last year thing, I believe. I don't think
4874480	4879200	it was much earlier than that. And it's had to creep back a little bit because supply chain
4879200	4883360	issues, blahdy blahdy blah. So these things are finally, it seems like it is actually happening.
4883360	4888080	It's happening! At the end of February is when this is finally happening. Pretty cool.
4888080	4896800	Yeah. So we'll see how that plays out. E3VL says GameStop is one week, I think. Bobby Blackwolf
4896800	4901360	is kind of outlining a lot of the stuff that I just said and saying every week when they know
4901360	4905600	how many they are manufacturing, they are sending emails to the next batch of pre-orders to pay the
4905600	4912240	remainder and get it shipped immediately. That makes sense. So remember when you gave us $5?
4912800	4918640	Here's your three-day window. Come get your Steam Deck. Yeah, Steam Deck, not to be confused with
4918640	4925360	what I'm about to talk about. But yeah, I know some friends that got one. I didn't get one
4925360	4928800	because I still kind of want to see what they're actually like and what they look like and what
4928800	4934000	the reception is. And the reality is now I probably wouldn't be able to get one for a while. But I
4934000	4940000	wonder how many people put $5 down that are going to not follow through with it now. I'd be very
4940000	4946080	curious about that. We talked about it here. Oh yeah? If it was going to be worthwhile just with
4946080	4953680	some of the things that I want to play that at the time I couldn't play on my Mac. And a lot of the
4953680	4959280	games that I would want to play or the reasons that I would want to play them make a Steam Deck
4959280	4964720	unrealistic. For example, you know how I like to mod Mass Effect to shit and back.
4965440	4971120	Oh yeah, modding is going to be interesting. It would completely eliminate any modding or
4972000	4981520	using screen effects. Like if I was going to play Dead by Daylight through Steam and I wanted to use
4982160	4989600	you know a color mod or something. I was going to say those Steam Decks will probably get hacked
4989600	4998000	within minutes. No, no, no. They're just PCs. But you can load whatever you want on them.
5000000	5007200	The operating system on them wouldn't work with the tools that exist. It's Linux, not PC.
5007200	5013840	So a lot of modding tools are based in. Regardless, regardless, I would want something
5013840	5020880	that's a lot more versatile. Instead of paying, you know, 600 bucks for whatever for it, I could
5020880	5026720	just spend that and fix my own machine. Will you close the door for me, please? Sorry.
5028720	5032560	Pixel pockets and chat says you can put windows on it if you want. And Mike Deaf says
5032560	5038000	Steam OS is Linux. So modding is pretty much. I would rather keep Linux, Linux anyway,
5038000	5043520	because it's a better operating system. But no. All right. Well, we've talked about the
5043520	5050320	Steam Deck. Now let's talk about the Stream Deck or an official attachment, if you will,
5050320	5055840	for the Stream Decks so that Elgato can charge you a lot more money for what some people have done
5055840	5062160	as an at home type of hack. But it is now an official foot pedal that comes that you can buy
5062160	5067440	for the Stream Deck, which is, again, the little multi-button machine. Like I use one here at OLR
5067440	5071680	to move that little sidebar for those that watch live up and down and change some of the scene
5071680	5076560	shots, run the classic Game of the Week video, things like that. So if I wanted to use my foot
5076560	5082160	to do it, I could with the official Elgato foot pedal. That's only going to be $115.
5084000	5089280	It's quite a bit of money, but OK. It's certainly, you know, there is something to be said about
5089280	5094160	having it just work. You know, if it's in the Elgato, you know, it's like a lot of the
5094800	5099520	reasons why people like to do the Apple stuff. It just works. You plug it in, bam, it goes.
5099520	5102240	Same thing with the Elgato. Please tell that to my Stream Deck
5102240	5108000	Mini that has decided to stop working properly while my full-size Stream Deck is fine. I'm kind
5108000	5112080	of considering an Excel now. Interesting. Yeah. The one here,
5112640	5116000	I think I bought this when OLR first went to Twitch at the end of 20...
5116960	5123680	I got a math, carry the one, 2018. And I bought that and it's still, they even, I just got a
5123680	5128000	version update for it because I think they did some Discord integration in the latest version.
5128000	5132320	I haven't really explored it, but I think that's the thing that they're doing. So it's kind of
5132320	5136880	interesting. So if I wanted to, you know, because I'm sure you guys on camera can see me reaching
5136880	5141440	for this thing. And so maybe it's visually distracting when I go to advance the story or
5141440	5145440	maybe wondering like, what am I doing over here? You know, so if I wanted to be more subtle about
5145680	5151120	it, I could have a foot pedal, would make us maybe make a thing. Now, again, some people have
5151120	5155040	made their own because I've heard about some broadcasters that have their own foot pedal that,
5155040	5159120	you know, essentially just, you know, presses a key on the keyboard or whatever hot key
5159120	5162880	kind of does it automatically. But if you want to integrate it in with your Stream Deck,
5163520	5170080	you sure can for 115 bucks. So there you go. I don't know if anyone's interested in buying one.
5170160	5177200	We'll see. Let's look up a DDR soft pad to a key patter. And that's what I only do.
5177200	5182880	Not only do you get three buttons, but you get like nine. So that's what I want. A DDR pad
5182880	5186960	that works with a Stream Deck. How on brand would that be for the history of the show?
5186960	5192240	Like anything. All it is is there. It's just passing through a key, a keystroke. You can
5192960	5198640	do the same thing. S.J. 100 Matt about the foot pedal says Mr. Smoosh would just mash the button
5198640	5205600	or sleep on it. True. Very true. Same thing with the DDR Matt. Smoosh would just plop right there
5205600	5209600	on the up arrow and then it would be forever scrolling the scroll bar up. The stories are
5209600	5213920	moving by themselves. That's how, you know, Smoosh is in here. It'll be interesting to see in the
5213920	5218400	new house if you can, because as it is now, he never comes to my side of the studio. So I don't
5218400	5222560	know if he'll even come into the office. Honestly, when I'm doing the show, I'll probably shut the
5222560	5227520	door, kind of like Dar Sacher does. So I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. There's a lot to
5227520	5234400	discover with the new environment. So. All right. Let's you know, we're talking about we're talking
5234400	5238720	about controlling things on a computer with your foot. I think we need to go back to a simpler time
5238720	5255120	when it was it was sprites. Anyway, here comes our next segment. And now it's time to travel
5255120	5260800	back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about
5260800	5268320	it. It's time for the classic game of the week. A true classic this week, Dar Sacher. What did you pick?
5269520	5279440	I picked Wolfenstein 3D, which is pretty much the granddaddy of our FPS games. I mean, if you think
5279440	5286960	about it, it is a first person shooter that was developed by ID Software, published by Apogee and
5286960	5297360	FormGen. It was released for DOS on May 5th, 1992, 20 years, almost 20 years ago. And it was inspired
5297360	5304400	by a 1981 Muse software game, Castle Wolfenstein. And this is actually the third in the Wolfenstein
5304400	5311360	series. So in Wolfenstein 3D, you play the role of an ally, allied spy,
5312080	5320480	William B.J. Blazkowicz, who is an American of Polish descent during World War II, escaping from
5320480	5327680	a Nazi German prison, prison castle Wolfenstein and has different missions to take down the Nazis.
5327680	5334320	It is very, it's kind of like a pretty convoluted storyline, to be honest. It is the second
5335280	5340400	major independent release by ID Software after the Commander Keen series. Did you ever play Commander
5340400	5357280	Keen? Rob? Okay. Anyway, it was programmed in part by John Carmack and John Romero. So they
5357280	5364400	decided to put it together and it was also designed by Tom Hall, built on the engine
5364400	5369760	that Carmack made. And it was meant to be fast, meant to be violent and unlike any other computer
5369760	5377200	game on the market at the time. Anyway, the game was released through Apogee with two sets of three
5377200	5385200	episodes as a shareware. And the first episode was released for free so that people would hopefully
5385200	5390320	pay for the rest. And then there was an additional episode, Spear of Destiny, that was a standalone
5390320	5397200	retail item from FormGen. It was a critical and commercial success, considered to be one of the
5397200	5406560	greatest video games of all time. And by the end of 1995, it sold over 250,000 copies. It's one of
5406560	5413440	the ones that really made, you know, put first person shooters on the map. I mean, I honestly
5413440	5423840	think that while a lot of people might think of Doom, this was really the bigger one. So it has
5423840	5431280	very rudimentary 3D graphics. It has different levels that are basically flat panes with
5431280	5437520	different divided areas. And each level is themed after a Nazi bunker and different buildings.
5437520	5446000	So you have to go through each area to find an elevator. The levels are 10 for each episode
5446000	5451600	grouped together by those episodes with a final level with a boss fight. You know, it has its own
5451600	5458400	difficult enemy. You have to fight guards and soldiers and dogs and other things while you have
5458400	5462960	to watch your ammo and your health. You can fight weapons and ammo is placed everywhere. You can
5462960	5468640	pick them up off of dead enemies. You can also get, you know, you get your knife, a pistol,
5468640	5478240	submachine gun, a rapid fire chain gun. And the enemies and objects are 2D sprites that will scale.
5478240	5484800	So it's kind of a 2.5D game. But anyway, you start with 100 health and if you get shot, it,
5484800	5489520	you know, goes down and then if it falls to zero, you die. And you start over with a knife,
5489520	5494640	a pistol, and eight bullets. You start with four lives. You can gain more with extra life tokens
5494640	5502800	as you go through it. So basically, the episodes, the very first two sets had, you know, each their
5502800	5510640	own series. So the first series was Escape from Castle Wolfenstein, Operation Eisenfoss, and then
5510640	5519440	Die Sure Die. And then the next trilogy titled The Nocturnal Missions was a dark secret trail
5519440	5527040	of the madman and confrontation. And basically it's the Nazis want to make an army of undead
5527040	5533840	robotic mutant people and you fight robot Hitler at the end of the game. The Nocturnal Missions is
5533840	5540480	a bit of a sequel, a prequel that talks about German plans for chemical warfare.
5542800	5548400	And then the Spear of Destiny, which was the standalone, has a different prequel mission
5548400	5553120	trying to recapture the Spear of Destiny after it was stolen from Versailles.
5554480	5560640	They did two sequel episodes, Return to Danger and Ultimate Challenge. And those have to do with
5561200	5567840	nuclear weapons and summoning demons. Like I said, very convoluted. Anyway, it began development in
5567920	5579040	1990. Basically, a group of employees from Softdisk calling themselves Ideas from the Deep.
5579040	5584640	They developed Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the first game in the Commander Keen
5584640	5594320	series. And then they were doing more games and more software and did things for Gamers Edge
5594320	5600400	video game subscription service out of Shreveport, Louisiana, which I had been to many a convention
5600400	5611360	in Shreveport. And then they wanted to quit and basically make their own company. Basically,
5611920	5617040	since they had created their stuff on the work computers during office hours,
5617920	5625760	they had to negotiate with their boss and agreed to do a series of games for Gamers Edge,
5625760	5633440	one every two months. Ideas from the Deep became id Software and they started prototyping
5633440	5645440	their own games. They really were trying to push a newly budding 3D graphics style
5647600	5655360	and wanted to push the limits of personal computers as well to make a fast 3D games
5655360	5664400	that would keep up with what most people had. So they took a different approach to
5664400	5668560	display their graphics. They used ray casting in which the surfaces visible to the player
5669120	5673600	are calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player.
5674560	5682000	And then John Carmack had his 3D engine made using 2D sprites and that started things.
5683760	5690400	So moving a big fast forward through everything, they kept working on Commander Keen
5690400	5697440	and a few other games. The last one they did was Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter,
5698080	5704960	which saying that aloud is actually kind of funny. They decided to take some inspiration from
5706640	5713200	Electronic Arts Deluxe Paint 2 and Pac-Man so they even have a hidden Pac-Man level in the game.
5714240	5720480	And as they put together their various influences, they made the game.
5721440	5729520	And so they made music for it. There were concerns, of course, about the violence
5730400	5738080	and screaming loudly in German and the death cam and stuff like that, but people liked it.
5740240	5747920	When they did Spear of Destiny, they used a new graphics engine that was licensed for
5748800	5751600	Shadowcaster and it became the basis of the Doom engine.
5752240	5762320	So that's how Wolfenstein 3D led into Doom. The big, weird, crazy thing about it,
5764480	5770960	there was the Super Nintendo release. Imagineer bought the rights for the game and commissioned
5770960	5777040	it to port it to the SNES and they were still busy making Doom and Spear of Destiny. So they
5777040	5784800	basically put it way off bat. Finally, they put one out, but they had to change so many things.
5784800	5791200	There is, of course, Nintendo's censorship, so they had to remove all the Nazi imagery,
5791200	5798000	remove the German voice clips, replace dogs with giant rats, rescale all of the graphics to fit
5798000	5803680	the Super Nintendo's. Because they take all the Germans out of it and everything else. What's left?
5804320	5815760	Right. But it was released in January 10th, 1994 under Wolfenstein 3D, the claw of Eizenfast.
5817280	5823280	And it went out in North America first and then Europe later. But also don't forget,
5823280	5828800	making the blood green and then finally just removing it. So finally, though,
5828800	5832880	they used the source code for the SNES port to convert it to run on the Jaguar.
5833680	5843200	And so they were able to take that port, but improve it well above the DOS version.
5844080	5850560	And, of course, removed the changes for Nintendo. But they had to slow the game code down to work
5850560	5858720	on the console. Anyways, it had so many different ports. In 1983, Alternate Worlds Technology
5858720	5868000	licensed it and converted it to a VR game. In 1994, Acorn Archimedes port was released.
5868000	5874240	There's a Mega Drive port done by Imagineer, but it was canceled because of technical issues.
5874800	5881200	1994, classic Mac OS version had three releases. The first encounter, the second encounter,
5881200	5887680	and the third encounter, happily named. There's an Atari Lynx version that was offered,
5888240	5895280	but never started. There's a 3DO version. Apple 2GS port that...
5897280	5900240	Let's see, it looks like they had some licensing problems with that one.
5900240	5904880	There's an open source iOS port that was done by Carmack himself in 2009.
5904880	5911520	An unofficial port for the Game Boy Color in 2016. An Android port titled Wolfenstein 3D Touch,
5912400	5918640	later renamed EC Wolf. There's Game Boy Advance, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network.
5921600	5926320	And the iOS port was the only one that had Spirit of Destiny. And then in 2007,
5926320	5930640	there was a Steam release for PC, Mac OS, and Linux that had all of the FormGen episodes.
5931600	5938560	Bethesda, which bought id in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of Wolfenstein 3D with a
5938640	5943680	free-to-play browser version of the game in 2012, although it was removed a year later.
5945360	5952480	Also, don't forget, Doom had, I think it was level 37, if I remember right,
5953360	5958240	was a secret castle, sorry, Wolfenstein 3D level. Do you remember that?
5958240	5963600	I do. I do remember, I don't remember if it was like 1-1 in this game that was remade in Doom,
5963600	5966640	but I remember one of the levels was straight out of this game. It was like a hidden thing.
5966640	5973040	You had to do like, id, dls something, I think. Because I remember,
5974000	5978960	I think there are codes that were in Doom. Some of them worked in Wolfenstein 3D, I think.
5979920	5985280	Yeah. Well, I remember that Wolfenstein 3D was also extremely moddable, hackable, and like-
5985280	5985760	Oh, totally.
5986640	5991120	I remember sticking around with a map editor for this game and having so much fun. And I remember
5991120	6000560	the Mortal Kombat mod that was really legendary for this game. Yeah, this really defines several
6000560	6003680	years of PC gaming growing up for many of us, honestly.
6003680	6008560	Oh, for sure. Well, and there's a little bit more, too. They had hoped it would make around
6008560	6018160	$60,000. Their first royalty check was $100,000. The game was selling about 4,000 copies a month
6018160	6028480	by mail order. It was the top shareware seller of 1992, according to PC Zone. And by the end of
6028480	6037360	1993, with the Apogee episodes and Spear of Destiny, they sold over 100,000 units each,
6037360	6042240	and the Apogee game was still selling very strongly into the next year. By mid-1994,
6042240	6048720	150,000 shareware copies were registered, and it had sold another 150,000 retail copies of Spear
6048720	6060640	of Destiny. However, 20% of the sales were from outside the US, even though the marketing for the
6060640	6066560	non-English areas was really weak, and the game was banned from sale in Germany because of Nazi
6067200	6072480	symbols because their federal department for media harmful to young persons made it illegal.
6073040	6077920	Famitsu removed the game, reviewed it five months after release, and said,
6078720	6082640	view from the character's point of view. It's a real shooter. The game is easy to play,
6082640	6089280	and it runs well. This is the only game of its type. And to get an American-made game,
6089280	6093200	getting a good review from Famitsu is a pretty big deal, just saying.
6093760	6094260	Yeah.
6095040	6099760	But yeah, not all the ports. So the early ports got really high reviews,
6099760	6106560	but their sales were not super great. The SNES one was considered a really good
6106560	6111760	conversion for what it was. Had all the music, the levels. It was still as fun,
6111760	6119520	even though the censorship was there. The Jaguar version was also highly well received,
6120160	6125280	but they did criticize some of the character movement and made it not as fun to play.
6126560	6132240	And the game itself, though, has aged so well, especially the 3DO version,
6132240	6141520	that they compare it to things like Hexen, Beyond Heretic, and Doom. But now it's a little old hat.
6142480	6148160	But at any rate, this is the game that spawned a legacy. I mean, we have
6150000	6158720	I mean, the thing is, is that there I don't know if they were able to re-release it in Germany
6158720	6166640	because of their software ratings board, but I think, oh yeah, in May 2018, a ruling
6168880	6177520	said that it was allowable in-game content. So the ban was reversed, and Wolfenstein 3D
6178320	6185200	decision was considered to be outdated, and that games could, as a form of, I guess, of art,
6188000	6196800	it could be released. And so in November 2019, so we're talking, you know, what,
6198880	6205680	I can math, 17 years after its initial release, it was finally removed from the ban list in Germany.
6206480	6213680	And this engine was licensed to other developers, like the Commander Keen engine. So other games
6214320	6219520	were Blake Stone, Quarter 7, Operation Body Count, Super 3D, Noah's Ark.
6222240	6228720	Okay, I always wondered why that game felt so much like Wolfenstein. Okay, I didn't realize
6228720	6235840	they had Rise of the Triad. That's amazing. It was actually, Apogee intended an expansion pack
6235840	6240400	that was called Rise of the Triad Wolfenstein 3D Part 2, but because the engine had been enhanced,
6240400	6248640	it was just released as Rise of the Triad. We had another prototype of the engine we
6248640	6257440	used to make Catacomb Adventure series. And then later on, the mods of Wolfenstein actually led
6257440	6264960	id Software to create other titles that went into, I mean, part of it was Doom, the Quake series,
6264960	6270560	and they left them to be modifiable because fans were having so much fun with it.
6272000	6275600	I remember playing Gachomon Quake for a very long time in Sailor Moon Doom,
6277520	6283680	you know, but it led to, you know, different imitators like Ken's Labyrinth, Nightmare 3D,
6283680	6287360	the Terminator Rampage, Terminal Terror, and Fortress of Dr. Radayaki.
6289120	6292160	And then we had the reboot. We had Return to Castle Wolfenstein.
6293200	6296480	We had Wolfenstein Youngblood and Wolfenstein Cyberpilot.
6300160	6306160	Because remember, if you can't kill Hitler in Bionic Commando, you can do it in Wolfenstein.
6308000	6312800	All right, well, there it is. Lengthy segment, but because there's a lot to say about this game,
6313040	6318320	Wolfenstein 3D is definitely one of the all-time classics of, you know, certainly PC gaming,
6318320	6322160	at least I certainly remember. I remember this, you know, playing this in high school,
6322160	6325440	downloading it from the local BBS, playing the shit out of this game. And then, of course,
6325440	6330160	when all the mods came out, it was really open season. But, you know, it is interesting the
6330160	6334240	things you kind of learn about it later on is that, you know, the fact that, you know,
6334240	6342480	as you were explaining, how it manipulates basically 2D sprites in a 3D space, you know,
6342480	6348240	it's kind of like Super Nintendo's Mode 7, like, amped up is basically how this game gets away
6348240	6353280	with what it's getting away with. But you really see it like how the lights look the same, no
6353280	6357920	matter what angle you're looking at it. What's that? It's not like Mode 7. Mode 7 is scaling
6357920	6364160	of 2D graphics. This is 3D. Well, right. And I did say it's not Mode 7, but like a super,
6364160	6368880	but it's that same concept of taking 2D sprites and manipulating them in kind of like a, I guess,
6368880	6374320	a 3D way. Although I guess, you know, Mode 7, if it never really changed the sprite,
6374320	6379360	it was just kind of like how the system was looking at it. But anyway. And then, of course,
6379360	6383680	you know, Doom comes out later that is that true 3D sort of game. But, of course, we don't get to
6383680	6388880	Doom without this. And, you know, as you pointed out, especially when it came to the mods and,
6388880	6392800	you know, a lot of the other things that were born of this era that I think a lot of us miss
6392800	6398560	sometimes. You know, you were talking about the chat room was talking about the no clipping stuff
6398640	6403680	being a code that was in the sky. I forgot about that, but God, yes. I mean, that that was early
6403680	6410720	speed running for me. Using IDD clip or no clip, ID no clip or whatever the hell the code was
6410720	6415920	to just get from start to finish as fast as you fucking can. Just bearing through the walls,
6415920	6419840	not giving a shit about any of the mobs that were in the way or anything like that. It was just.
6419840	6424320	But we know the best codes. Yeah. IDDQD and IDBFG.
6425040	6430400	There you go. There you go. I remember them to this day, just like I remember in Hexen,
6430400	6437600	you can use chicken. And that. God mode is typing Satan.
6440080	6444320	All right. Those are the days. Yeah, those are the days. Now get off my lawn. All right.
6444320	6450960	Your classic Wolfenstein 3D, which somehow had never been a pick before. That was the
6450960	6454000	somebody early on said that in chat. This hasn't been picked before. And
6454560	6460080	that's always like here. Here we are. We're in our nine hundreds now. We started this segment
6460080	6465680	on episode 250. So we're coming up on almost 700 of these segments. And there's always a game where
6465680	6472560	I'm like, we've never done this before. How? So. Fantastic. Thankfully, though, because Dark Soccer,
6472560	6477040	I know you're like, I think I think I might be running out of games here, but thankfully,
6477040	6482880	every week new games become eligible. As every week, new stuff comes eligible.
6483760	6489200	The general rule is that the game has to be at least 10 years old, although Dark Soccer has been
6489200	6493520	known to bend that rule as appropriate, but for the most part is stuck to that. So. All right.
6494640	6500800	There it is. Rules are meant to be broken and we embrace that here at OLR. All right. Let's do some
6500800	6504880	rapid fire news. I'm sorry. Actually, quickly, I want to get some more comments in chat here.
6504880	6511360	VXJ6V says, I never played a Wolfenstein 3D mod. Started with Doom for sure. The most legendary
6511360	6515680	one I can think of. And I even saw YouTube of it earlier today, because when I was grabbing the B
6515680	6520800	roll for Dark Soccer's classic game, I was like, I wonder if anybody ever recorded the Mortal Combat
6520800	6525360	thing. And they did. And you can see it, although what you can't see, or at least I didn't find that
6525360	6530160	YouTube, is somebody actually fighting a boss. Because the only time you ever got to fight like
6530160	6535920	Scorpion or whatever was the, those were the boss sprites at the end of the game. So those, those
6535920	6541920	would be fun to find. So yeah, that was, that was the mod, I think, in my opinion. But also the map
6541920	6546880	making mod. You know, it was just, it was just a simple program that would bring up a 2D version
6546880	6552000	of the map and you would edit it to your heart's content. And good times. Questbuster says, it's
6552000	6558560	also amazing to see that people are still making mods for Wolfenstein 3D, even today. I wonder if
6558560	6563200	anybody, I'm surely somebody along the lines like remastered it for 4K and all this stuff.
6563200	6568240	I'd be very curious to see what that looks like. So, all right. Don't they have those versions on
6568240	6574640	like Steam though? Probably. Well, certainly Duke Nukem. Duke Nukem had it, so I don't see why not.
6574640	6579280	So, all right. Pretty sure that's already been out. I know, I just never thought to go look for it,
6579280	6585760	Loki, to be honest. All right, let's do some other segments here. Let's get into some rapid fire news
6585760	6590800	and quickly discuss some other news in the gaming industry. Loki. Hey, remember that Mortal Kombat
6590800	6596400	movie that came out last year? Well, they're making another one. Okay. Must've done well.
6596400	6604320	I never saw it. It did okay, I guess. It was all right. It wasn't too bad. Certainly not as campy
6604320	6612080	as the first series of Mortal Kombat movies, but it was all right. So, there'll be a new one coming
6612080	6617920	at some point, but that's pretty nice. And then speaking of new things coming,
6619040	6623680	we're not really ready for this considering the GPU shortages that we're running into right now,
6623680	6630240	but Crysis 4 has been announced. And this is coming out or the coming off shortly
6630800	6636960	that it leaked on Chinese social media, but now they officially announced that yes,
6637040	6643040	Crysis 4 project is confirmed and they are working on the game. When is it coming out?
6644240	6651760	No idea. Just an announcement. Just hurry up and wait. But your PCs are crying already.
6651760	6658480	All right. Dark soccer. So, Yacht Club Games is going to be doing a quote,
6658480	6668000	groundbreaking announcement on Tuesday, February 1st. It's a mega announcement. We don't know what
6668000	6673360	the mega announcement is, but they're making one. Good for them. They said a mega announcement,
6673360	6682000	so we'll see. And then Final Fantasy XIV. It's back on sale, except you can't get free trial
6682000	6691040	signups for right now, but you can do Steam, PlayStation, a Squinic store. You can pay for it,
6691040	6697280	but you can't test it out for free. No test drives. And there's a new patch, patch 6.08.
6698000	6705840	Which fixed the sound issues. I'm so happy. So happy. And the Oceanic data center opened as well.
6706640	6711680	And the cues, honestly, considering the server I play on, I think is one of the more popular ones,
6711680	6716320	not the most, but one of the more popular ones. My cues are usually not worse than 100.
6716320	6722720	So the cue problems, it's not a big deal to wait like three minutes and usually I'm up and getting
6722720	6729280	a glass of water or something anyway. So yeah, it's a lot of the issues that were there at the
6729280	6734240	expansion's launch are starting to subside a little bit, which is nice. We'll see what happens
6734240	6740640	when 6.1 rolls out and there's new content that has everybody coming back, but we'll see.
6741680	6749440	Hmm. We'll see is a very apt thing for most of the stuff that's going on right now, you know?
6750000	6755120	Yep. I'm really excited. That's all I can say. I'm really excited about the data center travel
6755120	6758240	stuff that's supposed to come out with the next patch too. So I finally get to play with people
6758240	6761200	I've never been able to play the game with because we're on different data centers. So that'll be
6761200	6767040	very exciting. I hope it works. I hope it works out. Okay. Let's take a moment to travel around
6767040	6771440	the world and check out some release dates. So if you don't feel like buying Final Fantasy 14,
6771440	6774080	since you can't do a free trial, maybe there's a different game you want to buy.
6774080	6777520	So let's see what's coming out around the world this week. And we'll start with the U S Loki.
6778400	6783280	We have the life is strange remastered collection coming out on PC, Nintendo switch,
6783280	6791040	PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series and stadia and dying light to stay human
6791040	6796480	on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6797120	6803600	And then finally, Maglam Lord on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four. That's it.
6804720	6809440	All right. Going to Japan, pretty slow week on the Nintendo switch. There's an English version
6809440	6813360	of the game farm together that is getting a Japanese release published by rainy frog,
6813360	6817440	but that is really the only thing on the switch this week. I'm going to guess that Pokemon legends
6817440	6823200	having just come out, probably kind of dominated the switch cycle there. But if you go to your
6823280	6828080	PlayStation five, you can check out dying light to stay human, uh, which is coming out on February
6828080	6833120	fourth. Uh, and that that's it for PlayStation five. I just want to check the four real quick
6833120	6837040	and see if they get any, they also get dying light, of course, dying light to excuse me and
6837040	6842400	the farm together game, but otherwise that's about it. I'm thinking, uh, Pokemon legends,
6842400	6847120	they figured would keep everybody busy for a week. So, uh, nothing, nothing else that exciting,
6847120	6849440	at least this week, dark soccer. How about the UK?
6850720	6856480	Uh, just, uh, only really three things coming out on the fourth, um, for PlayStation,
6856480	6862000	X-Box dying light to stay human deluxe edition and regular additional is like,
6862000	6868960	um, switch autobahn police simulator too. And then for PlayStation switch Maglam Lord.
6870320	6876800	Looks interesting. That's it. All right. Just a few more stories for you. And then we will open
6877280	6883040	our discord for calls. Uh, check out our discord server over at vog network.com slash discord.
6883040	6886160	Uh, we have a variety of chat channels where we can stay in touch throughout the week,
6886160	6890080	including a channel where some of you submit your stories for potential inclusion on OLR.
6890080	6895120	And I do, I do use that sometimes. Uh, we also, we have a brand new channel on the discord server
6895120	6900160	this week, uh, for, for all the dead celebrity posts, because things are getting a little
6900160	6905920	depressing because every day it was like somebody was dying and what just today we,
6905920	6910800	we had our first post in the new channel. Howard has been passed away, which is, you know,
6910800	6916640	if you ever watched reruns of WKRP in Cincinnati, you know, how Howard has been Johnny fever. Yep.
6916640	6921920	Um, and, uh, also he had another big, you know, he was the teacher and head of the class was the
6921920	6926720	other big role he had. Uh, and then of course I remember him from clue. He had an uncredited
6926720	6930480	cameo in clue or, well, he might've been in the credits, but like he wasn't advertised in the
6930480	6935360	movie. He was the chief of police at the end. Yeah. Our lives are in danger. You beat Nick.
6935360	6940080	He was the, he was the guy trying to, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, which I can,
6940080	6948640	I can recite the entire movie clue by memory. So don't try me. Uh, but yeah. No thanks. I just
6948640	6955280	need to, uh, powder my nose. All right. I played Mrs. Peacock in the last shadow cast,
6955360	6961360	which is why I said the line. That was, it's, it's one of the few times I've done drag,
6961360	6968320	but I'm going to say I was, I was a damn good drag queen. I was all of my makeup was done by
6968320	6974080	one of the local Kings. Uh, shout out to serve Vicks who, uh, made a, uh, which I love that name
6974080	6978080	by the way for a dragging, but, uh, shout out for making me as nice as I looked, but yeah,
6978080	6987600	that was a fun show. All right. Uh, let's do no longer Vic knives. Um, so as a performer,
6987600	6995760	they are cervix and as a craft maker and that they are Vic knives. So gotcha. Okay. Okay. Um,
6995760	7001520	going into some other news, Loki was starting off with a headline that I saw this and I thought it
7001520	7008960	was cute. Yeah. As, as if you couldn't love the developers of, uh, Joe danger and no man's sky
7008960	7015920	even more. Um, now five years ago, it was easy to hate them, but now, now you can't help but
7015920	7024720	love them now. Um, so Sean Murray had shared this letter DM that he got, uh, from a, a child's
7024720	7028800	father, um, basically saying I'm writing this letter on behalf of my son, Jack. Jack is eight
7028800	7033120	years old is about the sweetest kid on the planet and has been diagnosed with autism.
7033120	7038480	As you probably know, children with autism deal with a great many struggles chief among them are
7038480	7043360	great difficulty with social interactions. However, one of the things that has enabled
7043360	7049920	Jack and I to bond is our share and love of video games, specifically Joe danger, Jack loves Joe.
7050640	7059440	And so, uh, paraphrasing the issue is that they used to play it on iOS and the versions of Joe
7059440	7068320	danger that are out were out previously, um, were basically taken off of the app store because they
7068320	7075680	weren't compatible with the newer versions of iOS. So Sean Murray then, um, took it upon his
7075680	7082240	team to update Joe danger so that they could play it again on iOS. So that's what they did.
7082240	7089120	They put out a new version of Joe danger and, uh, well, so the, the two mobile versions of the game.
7089120	7097520	So, um, let's see, Joe danger touch and Joe danger infinity. And so those are now been updated
7097520	7104640	and I guess they did a remaster on as well. So all because of the letter that he received,
7104640	7110480	it's pretty awesome. Yeah. Never underestimate the power of speaking up. So, um, I think that's,
7110480	7114960	that's cool that they, yeah, I know, I know a lot of like flappy bird no longer works on iOS.
7114960	7119120	If somehow you still have that game. Cause they did, they did that. Um, I think it was like 32
7119120	7124400	bit apps have to be 64 bit apps. I may be wrong on that, but it was some sort of change. They made a
7124400	7128800	few years ago, honestly, and just apps that hadn't been touched in a while. And Joe danger was one of
7128800	7133040	them kind of fell into that void where they don't work anymore. Um, but I think it's really cool.
7133040	7136720	They went back and they used it as an opportunity to clean it up a little bit. Like, I think it runs
7136720	7140880	as a smoother frame right now. And it looks a little better. Um, if you never played Joe
7140880	7146160	dangerous, it's excite bike ish trials, one of those sorts of games. Uh, it's cute. It's,
7146160	7151200	it's nothing like no man's sky. So it's wild that it's like the same team. I still don't like this
7151200	7156960	person first language that they used to speak about people like me. A lot of us prefer just
7156960	7164720	to be called autistic people. I don't know. It's the kid's father. So that was the one that was
7164720	7171760	writing the letter. Um, but I should, uh, definitely check out the Joe danger updates
7171760	7176400	on the phone. Cause it sounds like it's, um, super cute. So, and again, never underestimate
7176400	7181920	the power of a voice and speaking up and, uh, you might, you might get, uh, developers take
7181920	7186560	a second look at what you're doing. Yeah. All right. Um, moving on, I think we're too dark.
7188640	7195200	So Sega is hanging up their arcade towel. It's not, they're, they're not doing the
7195200	7204560	arcade thing anymore. Um, they have finally, um, uh, so, uh, we'll announce their intention
7204560	7212400	to sell their remaining 14.9% share, uh, with its arcade division to Genda Inc., which is the
7212400	7217840	same company they have, uh, that has purchased the majority of, uh, Sega's other arcades back in 2020.
7218400	7225120	So this will mean Sega Sammy is out of the arcade business altogether. Um, and its remaining
7225120	7234000	locations aren't even using any type of Sega branding at all. Um, the remaining centers are
7234000	7241920	being rebranded as Gigo Entertainment. Um, a statement from their chairman, uh, it, uh,
7241920	7247680	basically says they're going to rebrand Sega's, uh, major Tokyo locations, um, Ikebukuro,
7247680	7256320	Akihabara, and Shinjuku, um, before they roll out nationwide branding. Um, for manufacturer,
7256320	7263040	uh, Sega is expected to continue to produce units of its current games for worldwide distribution,
7263680	7269920	but for arcade, running an arcade, owning arcades, it's, it's gone. I mean, and we know that they
7269920	7274400	closed, uh, closed down all the game works over here. So. Yeah. I thought it was interesting that
7274400	7280160	this is, it was like this almost the same week, not quite, but like just within the same breath,
7280160	7284880	you have game works and now, you know, Sega's arcade, um, physical locations, you know,
7284880	7293280	in Japan, that is interesting to me that that one, two punched. Yeah. I'm not surprised. Um,
7294000	7304000	I mean, I think that even with, I think that the harder hit on it came with the pandemic.
7304560	7310720	I think that had a thing to do with it, but arcades were kind of, I don't, I don't know.
7310720	7315520	I didn't see, I mean, I don't know what the arcade situation is like in Japan, but
7316160	7322400	anytime I find an arcade, like an actual arcade, it's a unicorn and I want to move in and,
7322400	7327360	and put it in a protective bubble and never let it go. Well, I, I feel, yes, yes, I do agree,
7327360	7332160	but I, I, this is somebody who worked at a bunch of arcades. No, I know. And I feel like those sort
7332160	7336960	of like strip mall or mall mall, eighties mall arcades. Yes. Are like that. But what I do,
7336960	7343120	what I see instead is now this Dave and Buster round one thing. And that's, you know, now that
7343120	7347760	if we want to talk about Sega making machines, I feel like round one is going to be the place where
7347760	7351120	you're going to see those. At least you're in this. I mean, Sega was never really, you know,
7351120	7357200	it wasn't the same thing as it was in Japan here. Um, but, uh, you know, like there, uh,
7357200	7362080	Sega's makes a ton of those claw machine games. Don't they? I almost positive. I see a ton of
7362080	7367840	those and round one is full of those. So, you know, and, and whatever else Sega dreams up in
7367840	7372320	that space, uh, in the, in the near future for actual physical arcade machines, as you kind of
7372320	7379440	pointed out. Uh, but yeah, it's, it's weird that like the multi-purpose entertainment space is
7379440	7386080	what's still here, but not the dedicated arcade. Like it's, it's dark soccer, you know what it is?
7386080	7390480	It's got to have a bar. That's that's how the arcade stays open. It's got to have a bar.
7392240	7397840	That's seems to be people want to drink and play games. I guess, but that's, that's how Dave and
7397840	7404960	bust. I mean, I back even, even hell when this show first started 20 years ago, you, me, Loki,
7404960	7409680	all the people that ran in our circle, we, it was a huge deal to go to Dave and busters over at the
7409680	7414320	great mall in San Jose. Cause you know, the Roosevelt one didn't exist yet. And it's kind
7414320	7418720	of sad anyway, but, uh, it used to be a big deal to go on that road trip and go over there and go
7418720	7423280	to Dave and busters. Cause we're going to play a Derby owners club and, and all this stuff today.
7423280	7429040	It was like a big deal. And now I, you know, there's closer Dave and busters and soon we
7429040	7435040	might finally have a fucking round one here at some point, some point supposedly this year. I
7435040	7442080	mean the theater finally opened over there, so we're just waiting, but well, they're probably,
7442080	7448400	honestly, they're probably waiting for this Omicron thing to, you know, start to subside
7448400	7452800	where people feel a little more comfortable about going out. And I know, I know that we're going to
7452800	7457520	have to deal with COVID for a very long time, but it's the whole, what is people come people's
7457520	7461600	comfort level of going out. Uh, and round one is probably going to open until people feel
7461600	7466800	comfortable. And I'm sure you're familiar with what happened to, what was it? The, uh, the drive-in
7466800	7471920	arcade. Remember that I came up on the tail end of the last show. I think they burned down.
7471920	7479040	Yeah, we talked about it. I got to say though, um, clever work around by them,
7479680	7485920	uh, not for the arcades sadly, but I heard that they, the theaters opened again and they have
7485920	7490800	food trucks. They get six or seven food trucks over there to take the place of the snack bar.
7490800	7495600	And I thought that was clever and I'm kind of surprised more drive-ins don't just do that
7495600	7501600	naturally. Yeah. So that's a good alternative. He has a good alternative. Somebody thought
7501600	7507840	outside the box of that. Good job. Okay. Um, anyway, so, um, yeah. And, uh, uh, DJ
7507840	7511680	Roma S in our chat is talking about, Hey, Sega wasn't really in the arcade business. They paid
7511680	7516960	to have their name up on the arcades. G-Joe is the G-Go, Geigo is the company that basically
7516960	7522960	ran all the arcades and whatnot. Yeah. But it's still, I mean, it's still something to see a name
7522960	7528080	like Sega front and center now coming down off the window. You know what I mean? It's a, it's
7528320	7533920	certain changing of the guard that still makes us a little bit sad. Just like when they stopped
7533920	7540480	making hardware. So, Oh, Oh no, I know. I know the other one that makes me sad when their logo came
7540480	7545600	down at that building right off I 80 in San Francisco, right where I 80 starts in San Francisco.
7546320	7551840	When that was Zinga, it's still, I think it's still a Zinga. Yeah. So yeah, it used to be the
7551840	7557280	Sega building. That was, that's the closest thing I can think of Rama. It was sad to see their logo
7557280	7563440	come down and a different one go up. So a pistol pocket says, I like what Geigo is an acronym for
7564800	7570160	get into gaming Oasis. See, I always, I always thought Geigo was garbage in garbage out. And
7570160	7575760	that's something you learn in programming very early on, but yes, get into gaming Oasis.
7576880	7580400	All right. Let's move on a few more stories. I think we're back to Loki.
7580400	7590160	All right. So this is another example of memes becoming games and joy. We have one now with
7591200	7597520	steamed hams being its own point and click adventure experience. For those who,
7597520	7602720	I can't imagine anybody that's not familiar with the steamed hams thing from the Simpsons.
7602720	7608720	Now you can play it Allah, you know, data tentacle monkey Island or something like that.
7608720	7612880	I don't know it. What's the, I don't know the meme. You don't know the meme. Okay.
7612880	7623520	So it's a principal Skinner is making dinner for superintendent Chalmers and he is cooking a roast
7623520	7630560	and then it burns in his oven. So then he's constantly trying to trick Chalmers into thinking
7630560	7635920	that nothing is going wrong. So first he comes in and he's like, Oh, what's all that smoke?
7635920	7639600	He's like, that's not smoke that steam steam from the steam clams.
7640240	7645280	And then, so he decides to go across the street to Krusty burger and get hamburgers.
7645280	7649680	They brings it back in and pretends that the hamburgers are his own creation.
7650320	7653920	And he feeds it to them and basically said, well, wait a second. I thought you said we're having
7653920	7661280	steam cleansing. No, not steam claims, deemed hams. It's a New York dial area. It's a New York
7661280	7666000	dialect. We, I feel like that's been a plot in every sitcom at some point, but okay. I,
7666000	7670080	that's cute. It's funny. Yeah. Yeah. It gets, it gets even more ridiculous because their
7670080	7673120	house is burning down and he's like, what is that? You know, in there, he's like,
7673680	7680560	uh, that's the Aurora Borealis. And they're like this time of year in this part of the planet
7680560	7687760	localized in your kitchen. That's fun. Yes. Can I see it? No, it's, it's stupid.
7688320	7692560	So I'm assuming this game has about as much depth as the point and click adventure game.
7692560	7697600	Don't shit your pants, right? Is that it? Yeah, it's, it's very, it's very short. Obviously
7697600	7703360	it's just that bit. They added a few more dialogue pieces there from other episodes of the Simpsons
7703360	7708080	to get in there, but apparently the, um, the writer of that episode, the Simpsons, Greg
7708080	7715440	Daniels, um, thought is hilarious on Twitter. So, um, go, yeah, go check it out. All right.
7715440	7719440	Thank you. Thank you for explaining the meme to my old ass. I appreciate it.
7720640	7725520	All right. And last but not least tonight, something that, uh, Jason was teasing at the
7725520	7733280	top of the show, uh, the Oculus quest no longer called the Oculus quest. It's now the meta quest
7733280	7737920	because of course we know that Facebook has rebranded things. Uh, so if you own an Oculus
7737920	7744720	quest, guess what? Not anymore. It's now the meta quest. I don't know what else to say besides that.
7745520	7748800	And how we feel about that name change, but there it is.
7751440	7758240	I still refuse to call it meta. Sorry. I will, I will only call meta world peace meta. I'm not
7758240	7765200	going to call this company meta. It's just, I feel, yeah, but I guess, I guess now we have
7765200	7771280	to actually call it the meta quest or talking about certain VR headsets. Here's that, uh,
7771280	7774880	see a Tiberian chat says, ironically, meta isn't self-aware enough to understand it.
7775600	7779680	True. It's just called the device, the muscle that give you the meta muscle.
7779680	7785040	Oh, that's funny. All right. Let's get to the listener round table. Every week we invite your
7785040	7789760	emails, your calls on discord over at vog network.com slash discord and any other comments
7789760	7794800	or things you'd like us to discuss in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network. We do
7794800	7799520	invite your emails every week. Participate at orange lounge radio.com, but I believe dark
7799520	7803920	soccer has reported that she found dust and not much else in the mailbag. Correct.
7804560	7811680	Anybody? No dust. Anybody? No dust. Anybody? No dust. Uh, yeah. Participate
7811680	7815840	at orange on trader.com is the place to send your emails. I can't even talk about drag race because
7815840	7820400	I have, I admittedly haven't been watching the season really outside of just a, just the little
7820400	7827600	clips I see on social media. What are we left to do? Uh, anyway, um, jacket talk.
7827920	7834320	Okay. I haven't seen that show. Okay. Okay. I will. Okay. And I don't see calls in the discord
7834320	7838640	either. You want me to talk about it? No, I was just saying what TV shows should I be watching
7838640	7845360	then? Cause I, I see all this about yellow jackets. That one I see for euphoria. So there's
7845360	7849920	this clip going around the internet of the girl that's like in the dress and someone thinks she's
7849920	7854320	in the play Oklahoma and she just fucking loses it on people. And I was like, is that what high
7854320	7860400	school is now? I guess. Um, it's, it's wild, but like there's all these shows and I'm so uncool
7860400	7867120	cause I don't watch any of them. My wife made me watch yellow jackets. It was all right. Yeah.
7867920	7872240	That's the one Christina Ricci's in, right? Yes. She does not look like herself.
7873840	7877600	She's a little bit older now. She's not as old as she was when she played Wednesday. She's,
7877600	7883120	she's blonde in the show. So it's like, she looks like somebody else, but like, um,
7883680	7888000	she reminds me of not Amy Poehler. She reminds me of like, there's another SNL
7889200	7893280	actress that was on there that she kind of resembles, but I don't remember Kate McKinnon.
7895280	7898880	Maybe. I don't know. But like, yeah, she's, she's good on the show. I mean,
7898880	7904720	there it's, it's an interesting series. It's kind of like, um, you know, it's, uh, it's like,
7904720	7909600	almost like a survival drama, like a teen drama and then like a little bit supernatural stuff.
7909600	7914320	So it's a little bit lost-ish I guess. Although I say that with,
7914320	7920880	out having any context of what loss was like. Um, it's all right. I like it.
7920880	7927440	Um, question in chat, uh, from E3VL who asks, anyone see the Halo HBO trailer released today?
7927440	7930640	I believe it's actually Paramount Plus. Paramount Plus and it looks awesome.
7930640	7935840	Yeah. I don't care. I, I did see the trailer actually. Uh, I wasn't watching the football game,
7935840	7939280	but of course it was everywhere on the internet right after that. Um, it looks interesting,
7939280	7943680	but I feel like it's another TV show I will intend to watch and then never get around to it.
7943680	7948320	Um, but it looked, it looked interesting. I saw that they had Halo in, uh, Boba Fett.
7949440	7957440	Really? Uh, a whole area looked like a combination of Halo and the Citadel from Mass Effect.
7957440	7965360	Oh, inspired. I get it. Okay. Uh, Tiger Claw says the Halo TV series looks like it should be good.
7965360	7969440	Don't expect it to follow the same continuity of the games. They said it's an alternate timeline
7969440	7973600	that's adjacent to the games. Yeah. I got that vibe from the trailer. Yeah, I wouldn't. Yeah.
7974480	7982400	Just go in expecting a TV show and cause that's what you're going to get. Um, yeah, I, I, I guess
7982400	7987040	I should try to watch stuff on TV, but I, I tend to watch a lot of like Twitch streaming and then
7987040	7992720	I'm playing video games and, you know, forcing myself to watch the book of Boba Fett. It's so
7992720	7998800	good. I heard Boba Fett's not even in it half the time. No, no, no, no, no, no. He is in this one.
7998800	8003520	There's just the last episode he wasn't in it, but like, okay. The Mandalorian's all right,
8003520	8007840	but the book of Boba Fett's been kind of, I don't know. It's been awesome. I don't know what you're
8007840	8013280	talking about. It's been great. Okay. You got to watch the earlier seasons and the Mandalorian
8013280	8017680	compare like the action, the story elements. I have seen them both. It's a different kind of
8017680	8025040	story. And I think they're both equally good. I don't know. It's my opinion is right for me.
8025040	8030000	It's it's, it's odd that the, the best episode of the season is the one that he's not in. I don't
8030000	8034720	know. Well, I will admit that last episode was the best of the season, but I vastly enjoyed the
8034720	8041120	rest of it because I like the culture being built up the expansion of the world. And I think that
8041440	8045840	is absolutely fascinating. Plus, I mean, Ming Nao Wen is in it, so.
8046560	8051680	No. And I, I agree. I like, I like the expansion, the universe and the showing like different,
8051680	8057360	you know, side solid stuff. I like all that. It's just like, they have a lot of really weak,
8057360	8062880	they have some really weak characters. The Wookie is awesome. He's going to be my daddy.
8064160	8068640	I have to admit, I let, I cut my Disney plus loose. I let it go. I canceled it.
8069600	8073440	The, the, the, I know this when I do watch TV, if I watch anything, honestly,
8073440	8077360	this is so weird. I can't believe I'm going to say this. I, I really use Paramount plus more
8077360	8081200	than anything else, which is wild. I never thought I'd say that, but it is what it is.
8081840	8087200	So, but you know, I like a lot of reality trash TV shows and they're all on there and I've got,
8087200	8091760	I will, I will give credit where credit's due to Paramount plus they're starting to bring in the
8091760	8095760	international versions. Like I have been watching in the background, not a lot, but a little bit of
8095760	8100720	Australian survivor, which I'm starting to realize is superior to the one we have here.
8100720	8105840	It truly is like the way it's cinematically shot and told is incredible. So it's,
8105840	8110560	it's neat that they have that. Cause like, yeah, I love that they, they have different versions
8110560	8117680	of stuff. So yeah. And I need, I need to watch, I'm so far behind on Trek, which by the way,
8117680	8122080	I guess that Star Trek cruise that I went on a couple of years ago, right before the pandemic,
8122080	8128400	I guess they are going again this year because, uh, our friend, um, captain Matt from the former
8128400	8134000	store starboard power coupling show is going and was like, do you want to go there? He's like,
8134000	8138400	do you want to go? There's rooms available. And I'm like, not with the house. And I I'm,
8138400	8144800	I'm not quite at that. I know I've done some risky things, not quite at that comfort level yet,
8144800	8149760	but I hope everything works out, you know, it's not, it's still a month away. So there's still
8149760	8155840	a month, but, um, yeah, I just thought it was screening people at the gate. They,
8155840	8163040	I believe they are, um, like rapid tests on site. I actually believe vaccination and rapid testing
8163040	8171440	is a thing. Um, good. I I'm pretty sure. Um, but I, I saw a bunch of like, there was some
8171440	8175840	gay cruise that happened and people were packed in there. Let me tell you. And I guess they had
8175840	8181680	similar protocol and wasn't, didn't, didn't spread it. So precautions work. How about that?
8183120	8187280	So, uh, Bobby Blackwell says the rapid test for norovirus.
8187920	8192320	Bobby Blackwell says if they're in Florida, they can't lol against the law. I think they found a
8192320	8198480	way around it. I think you be, Oh, also it's a private company putting it on the private
8198480	8204720	company rented the boat. There's something they did to get around it. Um, and I, I know they had,
8204720	8209840	they have to log onto a website and put some of their paperwork on there beforehand or the
8209840	8214240	private company won't let them go. So I think that's how they're getting around it somehow.
8215120	8218000	And yeah, maybe, yeah, maybe they're testing on the boat or something. I don't know.
8219680	8222640	Anyway, but I don't know, cause I'm not going. Um, but I thought it was interesting that that
8222640	8226560	is coming up because somebody brought up Star Trek. I'd love to go next year if, you know,
8226560	8233440	assuming that, you know, COVID is more endemic and manageable and, um, that, uh, you know,
8233440	8237360	the, the money situation is good and all that stuff. I'd love to consider going again. I had
8237360	8243520	the best time, um, before, you know, literally the week before the, everything went to shit here.
8243520	8252000	So I'd love that. Oh, all right. Um, well, if there's nothing else, I think we will move to
8252000	8255760	wrap up the show. Uh, actually wait, I should check in with Loki and see if there's any last
8255760	8261520	minute stories. Yes. Let's talk about our favorite topic. NFTs.
8264240	8273280	Um, so apparently there was an NFT thing called block verse that launched that they sold an
8273280	8281760	estimated $1.2 million worth of NFTs, about 10,000 of them. And they were basically like
8281760	8288880	Minecraft skins, I guess. Oh yeah. There was some issue with it. Like, I don't know why they took
8288880	8294400	them down, but apparently they took them down at some point. And so now they're not accessible
8294400	8299760	anymore. So you dropped all your money and you don't even have the crappy picture to look at.
8300560	8308000	So you mean when things exist in a decentralized space, there's criminal activity and people that
8308000	8313360	don't follow through that exist. You mean in the wild, wild West, there were people that didn't
8313360	8322640	follow the rule of law. Yeah. Oh my God. People are doing shitty things to steal other people's
8322640	8331200	money on my internet. Yep. So, um,
8333520	8338560	that's unfortunate. Like I said, you know, these skins even look terrible too. Just, um,
8338560	8341680	you know, about the same amount of effort that, you know, was put into
8342480	8350960	the, the yacht club apes or whatever. Um, just, I don't know. It looks procedurally generated.
8350960	8355040	Bobby Blackwell and chat says they didn't break the law. Well, you know what? In the wild,
8355040	8367280	wild West, I am the law and they broke me. Technically, technically you still own that
8367280	8374560	link to the image. It's just that link to the image doesn't go anywhere. Technically,
8374560	8378800	you got what you paid for just, you know, you got your little certificate.
8380160	8390640	All right. No, nothing happier to end on Loki. Uh, no. Damn you. All right. That's all right.
8390640	8394320	All right. Well, we'll try to get some happy final thoughts. Maybe, uh, we're going to go around,
8394320	8397840	but first, uh, before I get everyone's final thought, I'm going to say thank you as always
8397840	8402080	for tuning into orange launch radio, whether you were here live with us on Twitch on this lovely
8402080	8406080	Sunday evening, uh, or you're listening to us on the podcast feed at some point throughout the
8406080	8409520	week. Thank you for being a part of our little family here at orange launch radio. Thank you
8409520	8415280	for being part of the show and keeping us going for the last 20 years and over 900 episodes.
8415280	8422640	Now, you know, I can make that joke. It's over 900. I can do this. Wait till we get to 9,000.
8423040	8430400	Um, I am the law. All right. Anyway, uh, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange
8430400	8434480	launch radio, spread the word, help us spread the word, uh, because we are the show where
8434480	8438320	every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here. So tell a friend or two. Um,
8438320	8442560	even if you hated the show, I'd be surprised you got to this point if you hated the show, but Hey,
8442560	8447200	some people hate watch things. What if I may say so for anyone who is here for the live show,
8447200	8452160	make sure you host because that improves our algorithm.
8453360	8458320	Yes. And sadly, auto hosts don't work anymore for whatever reason, uh, get better TTV,
8458320	8462720	have it add the host button and you click the host button and you're done.
8463360	8468480	Phil of nine and chat says, congrats on 9,000 episodes. Well, I trust him. He has a nine in
8468480	8474560	his name. So I think we, uh, clearly Phil is the expert on nines dress to the nines
8474560	8480080	comments to the nines nines, nines, nines across the board. All right. Anyway,
8480080	8483520	uh, thank you. A 10 is speaking.
8487920	8490400	Jamie suddenly rolls a new chat name. Jamie of 10.
8495280	8498800	That's when Bobby shows up with Bobby of 11. Wait. All right.
8498800	8501680	90,000 cookies is what you get after going on wish.
8501680	8508160	All right. Um, thank you again as always for being here. Thank you. Help us spread the word.
8508160	8512800	Uh, our discord server, vog network.com slash discord. Uh, I don't know what else to plug,
8512800	8516160	so I'm just going to turn it over to final thoughts. Dark Sakura. I know you're, uh,
8516160	8520480	going off to do your, um, killing and stabbings and all that stuff on dead by daylight.
8520480	8527440	What is your final thought tonight? Um, I need three other people to play with me tonight so
8527440	8531600	that I can be convinced to get my Michaela adept. If not, then I'm just going to stab people.
8532160	8536960	Ooh, I'm, I'm almost tempted if I didn't actually have things I need to do before work tomorrow.
8536960	8541760	How very dare you, but hit me up during the week. If you change, if you decide to try again,
8541760	8547280	well, I've got new days off now. All right. I'll be waiting. All right. Take care.
8549040	8553360	All right. And we will go, we will go to Loki for your final thought.
8553520	8559600	Uh, my final thought is I hope this cold goes away.
8561760	8568160	Me too. Being sick is no fun. Um, my final thought is that I have my first
8568160	8573440	a one C check since all this diabetes stuff started a few months ago tomorrow.
8573440	8577680	So everybody send good vibes. No way. I'm not ex I mean, I check my blood sugar. I know pretty
8577680	8583600	much where I stand. Uh, I'm expecting the news to be good, but I want the news to be really good.
8584240	8589360	So I will take your, uh, vibes and good juju and all that stuff. So appreciate that.
8589360	8594160	Uh, and that's really it. Otherwise, I can't wait to do this again in seven days. I can't wait to
8594160	8598640	be in my new place. Uh, I can't believe it's less than a month away at this point. Today is
8598640	8603680	officially the 30 day notice. Uh, although we told our current landlord a couple of weeks ago, just
8603680	8609200	to be nice. Um, but yeah, I can't believe it. Very, very close. All right. That's it. We're done.
8609200	8613280	We're wrapping up. We're out of here. Uh, thank you for watching. Thank you for being a part of
8613280	8619680	the show. Happy gaming everyone. And we will see you next week. Good night. You've been listening
