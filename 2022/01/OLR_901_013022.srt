1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,280
Oculus dev kits come out, kick starting the modern VR movement. Facebook buys Oculus.

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,920
Oculus requires a Facebook login, but that's okay because everybody has a Facebook account.

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,440
You can't play Oculus games if Facebook is down, but that's okay because that will never

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,560
happen, nor will people ever have local problems that makes Facebook unreachable. The Oculus

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,840
Quest is going to be renamed the Meta Quest and now there's a problem.

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,640
This is my old man YelsicloudUpdate, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,840
and Loki to tell you actual details about this headline and the rest of the week's gaming

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,920
news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:52,560
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:59,760
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,160
number 901 of our show for tonight, January the 30th of 2022. I cannot believe the first

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,080
month of the year is almost over and I feel like I've done nothing with this year. But I've done

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,400
these shows week in and week out with my co-host, so say hello first off. I'm Rob Roberts and say

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,520
hello to my co-host over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,120
Sup.

16
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,760
Hi, how are you?

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,920
I am okay for not a lot of sleep. I'm remarkably perky.

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,920
Good, good. I'm glad you're doing well.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Remarkably perky for me.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,680
You and I were talking about animated emotes on Twitch in chat a minute ago. Yeah,

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
a lot of streamers are getting access to that now and I didn't even realize

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
Twitch had built in their own animated thing.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,840
I've actually had slots for five animated emotes for like the last four months.

24
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,320
I think I just finally got around to doing something with it.

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,280
But I took my boop pig emote and I animated it.

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,560
Yeah, I see it in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,160
nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,560
twitch.tv slash v o g network. And yes, I see all sorts of emotes in chat.

29
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,040
I see this cute little dog pounding thing that you guys from losing color.

30
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,040
And I need to see about if I had the money, I would absolutely commission Kabuchi.

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, who is absolutely amazing.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,040
But as it is, I'm poor and I have to figure out how to do this on my own.

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,840
And usually the very talented ones have a list a mile long because word gets out that they're

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,920
talented. And so you got to wait, right? So Kabuchi charges, but the work is worth the money.

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,760
Of course, if I had if I had it, I would pay it. I don't have it. So I have to contend with my own

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:57,760
little crazy pixelated. You know, boop on the nose, same, same for me, public, public access,

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:06,240
public domain vector art and snag it together. I know I've done some to myself, but, you know,

38
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,720
I have to I have to really kind of it's a hodgepodge. I might as well use MS Paint,

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,520
that's for sure. I don't know what he's made in MS Paint lately, but say hello to tech master Loki.

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, it's all I'm all smeary today, apparently.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,040
What were you painting?

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,560
No, no, no, it's just my camera's all fuzzy for some reason. I was trying to figure out why.

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,600
I know this is gonna sound silly, but turn it off and on again. No, seriously, because I have a

44
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,720
weird problem with Discord. So I do the call with Bobby Blackwolf. And for some reason on, you know,

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,640
because he has the show and I do the call, like the little tease call on the at the end of his

46
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,960
show. And for some reason, Discord forces my camera into the lowest resolution. I don't know

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:54,800
why. And so to get it to work, I have to like stop it in OBS and then start it again, which is so

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,400
weird. But it is what it is. I don't know why that is. So

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,320
but it just picked the perfect scene. It's like even more blurry.

50
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,240
It just got fuzzier. Yeah. So who cares? It's fine. Well, I'm sick, so that's fun.

51
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,280
Oh, no, it's not the it's not the core. It's not the big one, is it?

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,600
Do you use your government tests?

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,360
I will. Our ones from school. But yes, yes, these are tests. And OK, it's not that it's just it's

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,880
another fun, you know, sore throat fever virus. Sinus infection?

55
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,320
I don't know, but it's fun. Everything's going around, not just the big one,

56
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,760
but everything is going. I had I had a scare on the big sea after the last episode of our.

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,320
I found out, you know, how I did that Twin Peaks event. Well, sure enough, one of the actresses

58
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,000
from the show posted to her Instagram that she was sick with. You know what? And I was like,

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,360
this this is how I get covid. This is, you know, that would be a fun story.

60
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,720
At least Palmer gives. Well, it was it was the other one. I'm not trying to name names.

61
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,400
I'm not trying to name names or shame anyone. That's why I'm not being as specific. You know,

62
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,440
you stealth folks can figure it out. But, you know, I'm sorry to hear that she got it.

63
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,960
But you're right. It would have been not not that catching covid is funny at all,

64
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,600
because many people have died from it. However, let's look at the fact that, yes, it would have

65
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,120
made for a very interesting party story five, five years from now. And I'm vaccinated, boosted.

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,560
So, you know, if I had gone through a week of hell, then, you know, I at least I would be OK.

67
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,360
But but it turns out I use I use my government tests to find out that I actually know it was

68
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:45,280
my Wario 64 tests because, you know, Wario 64, the person on Twitter that posts all the video

69
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,400
game deals and sales and things like that. Well, out of the blue one day where, you know,

70
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,200
this is how this is how that person makes money, affiliate links to all the Amazon things that

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,200
they're posting about and every all those websites that they are. Y'all are giving Wario a ton of

72
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,800
money, but it's fine. I mean, some would say they're doing a public service, never in the

73
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,960
money. Well, out of the blue, Wario posts a link to Amazon. Hey, Amazon has the covid test in stock.

74
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,080
Get them now. And it was one of those odd moments where it's like, OK, the dude who

75
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,000
gives me links to sales on video games ends up being the one to finally let me find a covid test.

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,280
And sure enough, I got my Wario 64 covid test. So that was one of the ones I took when I found out

77
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,880
not Laura Palmer exposed me to covid and I was negative. Thank you very much. But I was like,

78
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,040
oh, no, I have a sore throat. Is this it? But I got a bunch of tests from work and they actually

79
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,760
before you can go in the building if you're not like they have you test once a week if you're

80
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,360
vaccinated and if you're not, you have to test every day before you can come into the office.

81
00:06:51,920 --> 00:07:00,400
So because I'm not an onsite technically employee right now, they made me take a rapid test. It's

82
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
the first time I've done one of them. And like it came my results came through like right away,

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,240
but like you got to be 15 minutes like fine. And of course, it was negative. And I got to go in

84
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,800
and see some of my coworkers and and say hi and get the good coffee that they have at work. Oh,

85
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,160
my God, I miss the work coffee so much. Not like the coffee machines that they, you know,

86
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,080
grind it and brew it, you know, all of that there. But like we have like a coffee cart thing. And

87
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,200
oh, so good. You know what else is only good from carts? Churros, just saying.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,720
Or in the fashion district in Los Angeles. I don't I don't know if it's the gamer in me or

89
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,440
what, but I actually thought the at home covid test was kind of fun. It was like a little at

90
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,880
home chemistry kit. It's like, you know, let's put six drops in here, put this thing in here.

91
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,320
Oh, you got to follow the IQ instructions. OK, I was like, oh, this is kind of fun.

92
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,800
Actually, Rob, what you now know kind of what it's like to do a pregnancy test.

93
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,640
There was I haven't taken one before for fun. I'm just kidding. But yes, I'm sure they're similar.

94
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,640
Except, you know, it's up your nose instead of pee.

95
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,200
All right. I'm going to chat over at Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network.

96
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,880
Did your mom says Wario 64 is the reason why I have a ton of video games.

97
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Graduation, Rob, your nose is pregnant. No, not pregnant.

98
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,720
Let's see. Jaskarine says, what? I love Rob's Olar shirt. Thank you.

99
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,440
Unfortunately, these were only available for a limited time

100
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,840
because we had the store on an old Web site and we no longer use that Web site.

101
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,080
So that just says we've got to get a new store up and running. So I'm sorry. I've

102
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,840
personally been very distracted with my big move coming up, so it hasn't really been a priority.

103
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,360
But we've got to make that happen because Jaskarine wants a shirt. And I'm sure there's

104
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
more people out there. And for those on the podcast feed, I'm wearing an orange,

105
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,880
but well, dark soccer design this. It's Orange Lodge Radio, but it's in like a Sega style font,

106
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,000
inspired font, let's say. And it looks like you. I like it.

107
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,120
For the record, I do have all of my original designs and just make an account and I'll

108
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
get you the stuff. We've got to open up a store front and throw it all up there. We'll get to

109
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,760
that. I have my own store and it has been. It's really, really easy to do stuff on it.

110
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,920
Nice. Let's see other comments and chat here. Bobby Blackwell says my favorite thing is that

111
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,280
nobody knows who Oreo 64 actually is in terms of is it one person or is it multiple people?

112
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,040
It reminds me of Sushi X from back in the day. No, nobody. I mean, we know now, but we didn't

113
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,920
know then, you know, back in that for those old time gamers like me who used to get excited about

114
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,760
a new month of Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine available in stores. You get all excited about

115
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,240
those and you never knew who Sushi X was, but we found out years later it was a variety of

116
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,200
different people, if I'm not mistaken. It's kind of a mantle that was passed along, if I recall

117
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,680
correctly. So anyway, let's get into some more gaming and get into our kickoff topic tonight.

118
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,400
I hate that we're here. We go again with another NFT story. It's just like, God, it just won't

119
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,520
stop. But the reason why we keep bringing it up is because the industry keeps bringing it up

120
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,160
and people ask the industry people about it. And that's exactly what's going on this week.

121
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,680
Loki, I don't know if you would would mind taking us away tonight with this

122
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,080
and our latest update from executives versus the rest of us on NFTs.

123
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,800
Because every time that an executive said, no, listen, you just don't understand

124
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,440
why this is important. You just don't you just don't get it. That's always worked out for them

125
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,160
all the time. Like, I mean, just ask Microsoft how the original Xbox One launch or pitch was going.

126
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,760
So because people don't like NFTs and there's been a lot of backlash that they had made some

127
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,200
comments regarding it, basically saying that I think gamers don't get what a digital secondary

128
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,560
market can bring them for now, because the current situation of context of NFTs, gamers really

129
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:20,000
believe it's destroying the planet. And second, a tool for just speculation. But what we at Ubisoft

130
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,760
are seeing is the first or team first is the end game. The end game is about giving players

131
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,320
opportunity to resell their items once they're finished with them or they're finished playing

132
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,520
the game itself. Now, way to like totally not address anybody's concerns on that. It's like,

133
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,160
I don't I still don't understand with like the block chain stuff like I get

134
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,520
with these digits you're talking about. They're just items with numbers on them,

135
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:59,280
which is no big deal. But. Diem is managing a whole host of digital items without block chain,

136
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:06,000
like why do we need to incorporate block chain technology into this?

137
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,120
If you want to talk about speculative market, I mean, all that stuff that's on their digital

138
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,520
marketplace is pretty much speculative. I just think it's stupid. And it's also just like.

139
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:25,200
Why I like what's the point like. I just won't buy it like I won't play your stupid game like

140
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,360
I don't get the point. And even still, like on top of that, like,

141
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,800
let's say that, you know, there's an item that you can sell.

142
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,920
Does it mean you're going to have a buyer for that item? Like, that's the thing is

143
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,800
they're talking about like, oh, yeah, you can you can sell it later. Well, like,

144
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,680
what if no one wants to buy that piece of garbage? Exactly. That'd be like saying, you know,

145
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,040
hey, guess what? You can sell your old like Madden players, you know, for Madden 05 or something like

146
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,120
that. It's like, yeah, but no one plays that anymore. You know, that's the thing is people

147
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,680
move on. So. I think it's just a big waste. I think it's just if there anything, the reason

148
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,760
why they want to do this and they really could, like I said, do this without NFTs is they want

149
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,360
a piece of that transaction cost for processing the transaction for the buying in the selling of

150
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,960
whatever digital item it is they want to double, triple, quadruple dip on this stuff.

151
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,560
But like I said, team does this already with their digital items that they have on their

152
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,760
storefront. And they're like, not even things you can technically use for us. Sometimes it's

153
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:43,680
like training cards or a picture of a pickle or something like that. It literally has no utility,

154
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,320
but people are being speculative with it and they still take a cut of that on the marketplace. Like

155
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,320
you can do that without NFT. The NFT stuff, all that does is allows it to occur outside

156
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,120
the platform, which is really completely unnecessary. That's one of the other things

157
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,440
I'm not understanding about NFTs is that so many of them I've seen are so damn ugly.

158
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,840
I'm like, who, who wants that now? A lot of that stuff is procedurally generated,

159
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,080
especially like those, the Board Ape Yacht Club. I don't know what the hell it's called.

160
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,680
Sorry. I know Jamie wanted to jump in, but I just wanted to say really quick,

161
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,320
like there's a very popular, I'm just going to say, I'm not going to say who they are

162
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
because I'm not giving them free advertising because this company advertises on every podcast

163
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,200
except ours, but it is a very popular site to buy underwear. And I recently actually used this site

164
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,360
and I will say it's expensive as fuck, but it's actually probably some of the best underwear I've

165
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,800
had actually, but they posted on this NFT bandwagon thing. And it's one of those like

166
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,520
ugly ass monkeys that I don't understand. And so many people are like canceling my sub,

167
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,040
done with you, done with this. And I'm like, what this, this website, as far as I know,

168
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,640
had a really good thing going. Why are they throwing it away for a stupid monkey?

169
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,080
That an ugly monkey piece of art. I don't understand. I especially don't understand how an

170
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,480
underwear company gets into NFTs, but I mean, that's, I know I'm getting away from video games,

171
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,520
but it's just money that you can burn and like, look at we're current.

172
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,160
But it just screams to me. It's an investor thing that somebody sat those people down in a room and

173
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,000
said, this is cool. This is where it's going. Anyway. I'm sorry, dark soccer. I know you're

174
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,040
trying to jump in. I was just saying maybe, maybe I should make an NFT that says dark soccer. I made

175
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,560
this NFT. Give me a dollar. No, don't, don't buy into it. Don't just don't. But I know,

176
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,560
but it would be fun to like make a parody and use their tactics to prove how stupid their tactics

177
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:53,440
are. Um, Bobby Black, I've made exactly a dollar. Bobby Black open chat says the best analogy is

178
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,920
that old buy a star campaign that was around as a kid. People would buy a name, a star after a

179
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,560
family member, that star was now yours. You got a certificate that company went under no one else

180
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,560
recognizes that you own the star or that you named the star. Exactly. You can buy it by a

181
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,680
title. You could be a lot, a Lord or a lady. Uh, it's just, and, and with no actual landowning

182
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,440
rights. The interesting thing that's happened for me in the past week is that I've seen people

183
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,520
that I consider to be intelligent people making pro NFT arguments and trying to actually state

184
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,520
what the reasons are for this. Um, I'm not convinced, but I thought because, well,

185
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,720
here was the argument that I saw where at least it, at least it wasn't somebody just screaming at

186
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,240
somebody on Twitter. You're an idiot. You don't understand. You're missing out. You're missing.

187
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,360
At least I saw somebody say something that was like an actual thought that was a thought. I just,

188
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,760
I disagree with the conclusion, but the conclusion was essentially like, well,

189
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,680
you buy things in marketplaces all the time in games and essentially the marketplace owns those.

190
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,240
Well, what if you could go to a decentralized place where those things were owned? I want

191
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,240
to point out, cause I know somebody already typing in chat. I know the Ubisoft thing. Yes,

192
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,680
Ubisoft still has it. The comment I read was not in response to this Ubisoft thing.

193
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,000
And that was the argument. But to me there, I have two problems with that. Number one,

194
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,160
it still doesn't show that those items have any value, especially in video gaming.

195
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,960
I think we've seen that there is so much supply and not enough demand. Anytime these things get

196
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,000
opened up, especially like the Diablo three real money auction houses is because all of these bots

197
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,040
from countries around the world will get in and try to try to screw over Americans and other

198
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,440
global people that will get this. And the surprise was very, very few people were buying. And my

199
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,680
other, sorry, just real quickly, my other point with to, to kind of counter the, you know what,

200
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,360
otherwise, you know, I consider this person to be intelligent. I'm glad they're actually

201
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,800
having a real debate about it, but, um, the whole, um, fact that, um, uh, even if it's decentralized

202
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,880
to me, that actually opens it up to exploitation. How much have we heard about that? Bitcoin's

203
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,640
getting stolen. Crypto is, is like a big on the, uh, on the dark sides of the web and all this

204
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,480
stuff. Like it's, it's, uh, it's a wild West and in some ways I'm actually like, maybe

205
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,080
decentralization actually isn't good for some of these things. Anyway, Loki, I'm sorry, your point.

206
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,880
No, I was just basically going to say that I don't think we're going to have necessarily a problem

207
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,800
with bots snatching these up. However, um, it does allow the opportunity to make some of the

208
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:43,920
digital artificially scarce to drive up the price. Um, it's also just a big waste of the time. Like

209
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:51,200
once again, like we have cosmetics for video games have gotten to a point where they are

210
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,880
ridiculously expensive for certain things like a whole skin, you know, might be $20 to change

211
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,040
it to like blue or something. And now you're talking about, Oh, Hey, let's drive that price

212
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,040
up even more. Like, I just don't care. Like, I don't think that it would, it would make sense.

213
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:17,040
The only way that this would actually work is like, say you had some unified platform where,

214
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,720
you know, I can create a skin for some avatar and be able to use it across like a bunch of

215
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,200
different games from a bunch of different publishers, you know, um, or I, you know,

216
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,600
another good example would be like, say if you know, Sony were to sell all of their digital games,

217
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:45,440
like an NFT. So if it could create a secondary market for the digital games that you could go

218
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,320
and then resell that later on when you're done playing that game, that would be something,

219
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,040
but they're not going to do that because that devalues their stuff and they want,

220
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:03,200
you know, to drive the price up. I just, I just don't see this being done in a meaningful way.

221
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,520
And so far what we've seen these game companies use NFTs for is not a meaningful thing. Like,

222
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,360
yeah. Ooh, it's a helmet with a number on it. Are you ever going to be able to see that number on

223
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,760
that helmet when you're running around shooting people? No, you're not going to stop there and

224
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,640
go, wow, you have a number one helmet. No one cares. No one is going to care.

225
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,920
You, you, I think a part of what you said really hits the nail on the head.

226
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,680
Like, is that this is not the way to convince people to get NFTs ugly ass fucking procedurally

227
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,080
generated monkey art is not the way to convince people stealing other people's art, not the way

228
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,720
to convince people that NFTs are yet. Now, when you talk about these types of things that like,

229
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,240
if I make a design, like maybe something that is like, let's say, let's say, I don't know,

230
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,520
like the VOG logo or something that, you know, we, we, you know, have here at VOG and maybe we

231
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,560
can take that and put it on in game stuff and we can move that from game to game and things like

232
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,480
that. Like there's something there where I'm like, that seems a little more interesting, but I just

233
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,120
like, I don't feel that you necessarily need the blockchain's involvement for that. It just takes

234
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,520
the right strategic partnerships with companies to make that happen. And then it would actually

235
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,760
be regulated, which I actually think at the end of the day is probably a good thing.

236
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:30,560
Yeah. And a lot of times with NFTs now, nowadays, it's just, you own the link to that piece of art,

237
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,080
which they can just take it offline too. And that's happened. So it's, it's, it's stupid.

238
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,240
Jason in chat says, by the way, great voiceover work tonight, Jason says a value is subcultural

239
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,800
niche. NFTs being hype is trying to astroturf that into the mainstream for various reasons.

240
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,200
Oh, astroturf it. I love that. Two highly valuable things in Rocket League that mean

241
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,240
nothing to a non-player, white zombas and alpha boost. A lot of the problem is the mainstream

242
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,800
nature of it more than the thing itself. Well, let's go, let's go back to the comment. And,

243
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,920
and this is the other thing that gets me is these executives that are fucking clueless,

244
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:17,040
that I get paid millions of dollars to be fucking morons that just dig their heels in on this stuff

245
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,000
and to, to make a claim like, you know, oh, gamers just don't want NFTs cause they don't

246
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,800
get it. Yeah. We don't get why you keep shoving it down our throat. Like stop, you know, let it

247
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:35,040
be the niche thing that it is. Is I, I, I, how these folks stay. And of course it's coming from

248
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,760
Ubisoft, a company that's got all of that's all sorts of issues up and down anyway. So

249
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:49,200
Ubisoft's getting bought by someone for the years over. Just wait, just wait. All right. Let's move

250
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,280
on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week. Dark

251
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,840
Sakura, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week? Um, well, as I was saying, um, before the

252
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,640
show, I, and I mentioned this last week that I had been redoing my windows 11 on, on, uh,

253
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,680
for arm on parallels. Um, I got Mass Effect installed. I tried to run the first game.

254
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,160
No, it just would stop. It would go right back to the launcher. So on a whim I tried Mass Effect 2,

255
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:28,960
it loaded just fine. So did Mass Effect 3. So I had to go haul my ass to find a gibbed editor that

256
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,480
will work. So I'm going to start a game for Mass Effect 2, then cancel out of the game, modify my

257
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:46,080
save file. Um, and then I can start Mass Effect 2 the way I want to. Um, but I, I don't know what

258
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,800
it is, but I think the emulation is getting a lot better. Um, it's, I, I still had trouble with VHS,

259
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:01,920
which I might do the next update and try VHS again. So we'll see. But, um, a, a mutual streamer

260
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:12,320
friend of ours, uh, made use of my VHS and did not care for it that much. Hmm. So, um, anyway,

261
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,160
um, I, of course I have played Dead by Daylight right now as the lunar event, lunar new year event.

262
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,160
Um, if you log in every day, you get 50,000 blood points every day, which is nice. Um,

263
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,120
I have decided to also, uh, try to P350 my Freddy first out of, out of just pure,

264
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,640
I don't know, reasons. I don't know why people don't like Freddy. Freddy's awesome.

265
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
They don't like playing against Freddy. That's what it is.

266
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,800
And the thing is like, people are like, oh, Freddy got, Freddy's still freaking strong,

267
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,480
no matter how much they have nerfed him, a good Freddy player will nail you. End of story. Um,

268
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:59,520
I have also played a little bit of demons tilt because that game is fun. I picked up the Apple

269
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:06,480
arcade version of Zen pinball. Um, cause it has theater of magic and a few other tables that I

270
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,200
like on it. And I own a theater of magic, but I would like to stream a theater of magic as well.

271
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:19,760
So now I can do both. Um, uh, I played, uh, of course I've had, you know, freaking word scapes

272
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:28,240
cause it's great. And I started playing, um, uh, Marvel contest of champions on my iPhone

273
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,320
and I don't know, but it's kind of fun. It's just like a little silly fighting game.

274
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,760
And one of these days I'll get like characters. I actually like, even though they're random

275
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,040
and I think that's about it. All right. Yeah. We'll go to Loki and your gaming week.

276
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,560
Um, I did play more than one thing this week, so, um, I, I was feeling pretty brain dead

277
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:03,360
earlier today, so I jumped back into, um, power washing simulator. Oh, good. That's always a nice

278
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,400
relaxing game. Yeah. Yeah. A little too much though. It actually almost put me asleep. So I,

279
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,240
uh, I had to stop playing it after a while, but, uh, I was washing a carousel. So that's

280
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,320
the level I was on for that. Um, and then of course more Minecraft, obviously. Um,

281
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,840
I put out my new episode this morning, so that's out there now. My, uh, starter base,

282
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,400
which is enormous. So now I got to top that. That's going to be a lot of blandy. Um,

283
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,840
yeah, it's pretty much that was pretty much it. I didn't play a whole ton this week. Cause like

284
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:47,120
I said, I haven't been feeling well the last few days. Um, but probably more Minecraft this week.

285
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,840
Hey, at least you got a video posted. You keep keeping that going. That's good.

286
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,920
So yeah. Everyone check that out on YouTube at Loki. Um, so my gaming week, I actually played

287
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,880
a lot this week. Um, yeah, I played some of my usuals, uh, continued on final fantasy 14,

288
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,880
of course. Cause you know, y'all know, I love that working on leveling my dancer and my white

289
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,280
mage, just depending on what I feel like playing that day as I, I work on my new quest to get all

290
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,480
my jobs to 90, uh, to go with this expansion. Cause why not? Uh, and then I've also been playing

291
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,480
dead by daylight as well. Probably not as much as dark soccer, but a little bit. Uh, I'm working,

292
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,640
I'm actually my first P three 50 is going to probably be Cheryl. Um, cause she's already

293
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,360
the P three part. And now I think she's up to like level 46 and you get a decent amount of blood

294
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,360
points from this event. So, um, the only thing that ticks me off is I can't get borrowed time

295
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,000
to show up on her fucking blood web. And that is when you solo queue, that talent is so needed.

296
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,760
It wasn't, it was on there not long ago. No, no, no. I I'm not trying to seek her. So I mean like

297
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,560
showing up in your blood web to get it. I can't get it. So it's just, you know what the new thing

298
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:57,360
is right now, right? Hmm. What's that? Like flip flop. Oh, boil over in that whole thing. Yeah.

299
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:05,040
Yeah. I'm like, all I've just been doing is bringing when I'm not doing the, the calendar,

300
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,880
the lunar, uh, envelopes, I'm just bringing whatever shortens the distance between, uh,

301
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,000
uh, hooks. You gotta be careful too. A lot of killers will just let you bleed out. If

302
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,440
you're going to play that game to just mess with killers. So, Oh no, I'm just saying in general,

303
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,320
to the, to the millions of listeners we have out there. It's all been slugfest and honestly,

304
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,600
I don't like to do that to people. Um, unless they've just been, I don't either, but I will.

305
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,320
Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, other games I've been playing, um, uh, let's see. So, uh,

306
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,640
some new stuff. I played Taiko no Tatsujin because that, that just came out. A new version of it came

307
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,560
out on a, I guess it was PC as well as Xbox, but I picked it up on Xbox game pass. Um, and, uh,

308
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,720
I was playing a little bit of it and it's got a, it's got a cute song list. Uh, it has Undertale

309
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,040
music in it, which kind of cracked me up. Uh, it has like a variety of different Namco stuff,

310
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,240
but then like it has the random like Capcom song. Like there was, you know,

311
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,960
Ray you from street fighter five is there. And this was the thing that cracked me the fuck up.

312
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,640
Then they have, you know, they have some J-pop songs. They have some, uh, vocaloid,

313
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,240
like Hatsune Miku sounding songs. They have a pretty decent mix of things. And then they have

314
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,680
pop songs. The most random fucking pop songs are in there. I want you back by the Jackson five.

315
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,400
That's not that, that, that obscure. That's a pop standard. Here's the one that made me laugh.

316
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,840
You're going to lose Whamageddon every time you play this game because last Christmas by Wham

317
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,120
is in the game. Why? I don't know. I don't know, but it's fucking funny. Yeah. It's,

318
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,360
it's very memeable. I don't mind the Whamageddon. I mind the Mariah apocalypse.

319
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:48,160
Well, Mariah, Mariah, uh, Taiko no Tatujin is Mariah free, but for whatever reason last

320
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,120
Christmas by Wham is there. And that just cracked me the fuck up. So yeah, it's an interesting song

321
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,120
list. Uh, I was having a little problem. Like the timing was throwing me and I didn't even,

322
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,800
I was listening to Bobby show. He went a little more in depth, uh, on Taiko no Tatujin. Cause I

323
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,160
guess it has more issues on PC. Like it won't even play right now. Um, but I, I didn't even

324
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,920
know you could go into a calibration mode. I don't like the interface particularly.

325
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,240
I do remember playing the switch version and the switch one had a better interface than this one.

326
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,600
Um, but this one is with game pass, so I didn't pay anything extra for it.

327
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,440
So that was cool. And it has super easy, uh, achievements. You keep getting five point

328
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,280
achievements, bing, bing, bing, bing, like, like open a menu and you get an achievement.

329
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,880
It's really, really silly. That's for sure. So, um, interesting. Hi Akuma JP is in our chat and

330
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,040
I haven't seen Akuma JP in a long time. It's so good to see you. Um, I know life happens sometimes

331
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,320
you can't make it every week, but it's so good to see you tonight. And Akuma JP says,

332
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,800
Japanese love that song last Christmas. A lot of, a lot of Americans do too, but I think it's become

333
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:55,680
a me like to put it in perspective, you cannot go into a Dennis office in November or December and

334
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:01,760
not hear that song. Cause you know, Dennis office always play that smooth rock. It's time for the

335
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:10,880
smooth mix and now coming up, Kenny G followed by Celine Dion. You know, you know what though?

336
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,760
What I am now going to incorporate last Christmas when I eat my KFC

337
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,560
for Christmas, you should, you should, because I think that the KFC tradition from Japan is the

338
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,760
best tradition ever. Only second to the Jewish tradition of eating Chinese food.

339
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,160
Uh, yes. Uh, both good traditions, but if you want to make playing last Christmas and Taiko

340
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,320
no Tatsujin your new tradition, you sure can. So I played a little bit of that. It's, it's cute,

341
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,640
but I, I didn't play a lot of it because the next day was the release of Pokemon legends,

342
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,720
which I picked up, um, Pokemon that I've been saying Pokemon legends are chaos,

343
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,880
but I guess it's supposed to be Arceus or Arceus. Um, but, um, you know what language is fluid and

344
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,120
I'm saying Arceus because that's what it feels like. You know what these games don't have,

345
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,920
it's 2022 and these games still don't have voice acting. So as far as I'm concerned,

346
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,640
they're leaving it up to us and our imaginations to dream it up. I have to, I would have to look at,

347
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,160
uh, uh, Kana to see how it's supposed to be pronounced there. And that's where they're

348
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,200
getting the Arceus from is, is the original Japanese text. Well, and on top of that,

349
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:31,600
a C in that respect would typically be a soft C. So it makes sense to me. Yeah. But then again,

350
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:39,440
people, you know, don't say GIF. I know they say GIF because then the creator, right? So yeah.

351
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,920
So he's a nice, I say it's a GIF, GIF thing. And I also say it really doesn't matter what you call

352
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,960
the game. Um, it's gonna be the same game at the end of the day. And it's, it's actually,

353
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,520
I'm really enjoying it. I'm really, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it, but I did the right thing

354
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,320
and I didn't buy into a lot of the hype. And I find when I do this with games, I always enjoy

355
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,000
it better because that was my secret with No Man's Sky. Remember I, I didn't, I didn't hate No Man's

356
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,800
Sky 1.0. I thought it was a little bare bones, but I didn't hate it because I didn't buy into

357
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,040
the fucking hype. And I did that. And believe me, Shane, Shane would send me text messages quite

358
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,320
frequently with the latest and I would be kind of like, oh, neat, sounds neat, but I didn't really

359
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,480
watch a lot of videos or anything. And I think I'm actually better for it because it made the

360
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,240
experience a lot more like, oh, oh, oh, oh, I wasn't expecting, oh, oh. And that was kind of

361
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,560
like what it's been playing the game so far. Uh, is, uh, it's, it's neat. So yes, a lot of people

362
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,560
are saying that this is like Pokemon meets Breath of the Wild. And I, I absolutely see those

363
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,400
comparisons because they've definitely put in like the crafting, the open world, the multiple

364
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,680
ways to do things. Uh, even some of the, uh, musical cues sound really familiar. And like the,

365
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,800
the interface looks kind of familiar a little bit. I would also say that there's a lot in common

366
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,360
with Pokemon Snap, uh, which is a little more of a deeper cut, I think for some people. But

367
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:06,080
I think the way that you are encouraged to like the stealth in this game is actually a little

368
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,600
more Pokemon Snap to me, um, in that you have to snap things a certain timing in a certain way,

369
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,880
uh, to really get the max points. And I think there's some of that too in this. Um, but I also

370
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,360
like that they've really changed the concept of the Pokedex because usually with the Pokedex and

371
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,160
the mainline games, you get like half a check for seeing the Pokemon and a full check for catching

372
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:31,920
the Pokemon. In this game, catch them all isn't good enough. You got to catch them all. You got

373
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,760
to catch them all off guard. You got to use them all to see certain moves. You got to, you got to

374
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,120
do all these different things with it to really master that entry in your Pokedex. Now you only

375
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:47,440
have to get so many, like you don't have to like catch 50 of each Pokemon just to check off the

376
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,480
Dex entry. It gives it to you at a pretty low number, but you have to do more than just catch

377
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,640
it. And I think that's interesting because it's really been encouraging me to rotate my team more

378
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:03,600
often. Um, so yeah, there's a lot, like I just, I think the gameplay is a lot more interesting

379
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,320
than any of the mainline Pokemon games that I've played. I like the fact that there's side quests.

380
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,640
I like how the open world lends itself to that. And the fact that you can really feel like you

381
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,880
can do things in whatever order. And maybe you feel like you're a little behind in levels on

382
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,600
the main quest. Okay, go do these side quests. You know what? I need to go grind some of these things

383
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,600
so I can craft more Pokeballs. I like that. Like, I like that it's a little bit like you don't feel

384
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:34,720
like you haven't done anything if you spend an hour just catching more Bidoofs and getting

385
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,760
material needed for Pokeballs because you still have, you're going to need those Pokeballs later.

386
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,360
And you know what? You're going to have that full entry on Bidoof and your Poke decks.

387
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:49,120
So, um, I think that's, I think that's all really neat. I don't think the game is perfect. I'm

388
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:54,880
going to say, this is my biggest complaint about the game. It feels like a PlayStation 3 RPG.

389
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,880
This like, and I think that's what frustrates people time and time again with Nintendo and

390
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,920
especially Game Freak. Like you think Nintendo's, I mean, at least Breath of the Wild

391
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,720
felt very cutting edge. Game Freak is always really behind in their technological skills

392
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,800
and all this. Um, it just feels like you're playing something on the PlayStation 3. Now,

393
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,960
a good game is a good game, no matter what the graphics are. So does that really matter at the

394
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,920
end of the day? Not really, but it is still frustrating to see that potential. And when

395
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,440
you see those comments on Twitter from people that are like, Sony should buy Nintendo. So

396
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,480
Nintendo has to make PlayStation 5 games. That's where those comments come from.

397
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:43,920
Is the frustration on the PlayStation 5. I mean, that's, that is very true. Um,

398
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,680
is that you just, you see the potential for more with like, like I just said at the beginning,

399
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,560
it's 20, nobody knows how Arceus, Arceus, Arceus is pronounced. Well, I mean, you all have your

400
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,520
arguments, which is fine, but we don't really know because there's still no voice acting in

401
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,880
these games. And to be quite frankly, a lot of the text and everything feels a little bit like

402
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,520
a slog in the beginning of the game. But once you finally get into it, it is really rewarding. And

403
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,840
to be fair, and I think it's important to say, Pokemon Legends will still run in handheld mode.

404
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,760
And a lot of people are running it in handheld mode and for a handheld game,

405
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,560
it does look really good. So there is that. And if you are going to be playing exclusively in

406
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,800
handheld mode, then probably my PlayStation 3 comment isn't gonna, isn't gonna make a

407
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,400
lick of difference to you. But yeah, it is frustrating to see that potential really

408
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,600
lagging behind. Especially when you have games like Xenoblade Chronicles looking the way it

409
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,880
does on the same hardware. It's like, you could probably do a little better if you put a difference

410
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:56,400
to do behind it. But Game Freak gonna Game Freak. Chad Stars again chat says, no, we know how it's

411
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,480
pronounced. Sure. We know how Jiff is pronounced, but we all rejected that and said, no, it's GIF.

412
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,640
I mean, you know, it's, people are going to do what they're going to do. Language evolves.

413
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,320
Let's see. Jason in chat says, I've been thinking about buying Arceus thinking it might be the game

414
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,400
that gets me back into the series after I, after I tired, I'm tired of the mainline mechanics.

415
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,120
I would really, you know, not to, not to promote my own stream, but I would encourage you to check

416
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,840
out some YouTubes and streamers that are playing the game just to get a feel if it might be for you.

417
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,840
Because just reading your comment, if you're sick of the mainline mechanics,

418
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,600
this is a different game. Now, yes, you do do battling in this game, and it's actually kind

419
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,080
of hard. Like you can't really steamroll Pokemon just because you have a type advantage. They can

420
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,080
still do a decent amount of damage to you, and you'll feel like you're burning through potions.

421
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,200
But in a way, I feel like that feels a little more rewarding for having crafted those potions

422
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,480
in the first place than just my usual hoarder tendencies in a Pokemon game to just run right

423
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,560
back to a Poke Center and never have to touch a potion, except unless I'm in a gym battle or

424
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:09,840
something like that. So there is that as well. So. SSG100Matt in chat says, I don't give Nintendo

425
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,160
a hard time because they make these games fun. Nintendo had the biggest selling game last year,

426
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,040
Animal Crossing. That is not a big graphically demanding game and no real voice acting. Yeah,

427
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,960
fair point. And I didn't say, you know, again, I really like this game. It probably. I mean,

428
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,880
ask me after I've spent a few more hours in it. It's probably honestly probably going to be my

429
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,640
favorite Pokemon game. I feel like it's that much better than like even the mainline games and all

430
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,600
that. But let's say give me a few more hours just to really make sure on that point. But I'm not

431
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,720
I'm not saying I don't get frustrated that there's that potential to be even better

432
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,800
that is unrealized. But I guess this is the first in a series and hopefully the first in a series.

433
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,560
I don't after the critical reception this game's getting and I would imagine the sales have been

434
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,120
pretty good to just based on my social media. I don't see how they don't think about having

435
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,320
to do a follow up in one way or another to this series. Loki, you're going to say something?

436
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,560
Oh, no, I was going to say, yeah, even though the Animal Crossing was the best selling game,

437
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:15,680
and it has a simpler art style, doesn't mean that they didn't execute their art style flawlessly. I

438
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,280
mean, I think that there could have been a lot that they could have done to make that game look

439
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,760
better. It does look pretty rough around the edges. Not to say it's a bad playing game,

440
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,840
but it's like, and they kind of could have done a little bit more with this.

441
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,640
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says I was speaking towards the internet trolls who think that

442
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,360
Nintendo needs 4K gaming with all the P's. Well, it wouldn't hurt. And there is a part of me that

443
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:47,760
kind of wonders, was this game originally being made for a 4K switch and maybe we're seeing a

444
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,000
scaled down version of the graphical power? I hope not, because I would look terrible in 4K.

445
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,240
But what if we're not seeing the fully realized version? Because, I don't know.

446
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,120
Just a thought. Anyway, because even if you're into those art assets in the

447
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,680
low resolution, that still isn't changed how they have every the models and stuff in the game. It's

448
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,360
just, no, like, really, to me, what stands out is really cheaply done is the environments. The

449
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:21,600
environments to me look like, you know, it looks like stuff I would come up with in Unity, because

450
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,800
I have no experience in making environments that look organic. It would be the stuff I'd come up

451
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:37,360
with, unfortunately. And that's not a compliment. I think they could have done better. It just looks

452
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:44,480
old. It looks dated. Shad Starsick in chat says this is considered mainline and not spinoff,

453
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,080
so it could easily get another entry. Good. However, y'all want to spin it with a different

454
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,280
series of things. I think that this definitely deserves another entry. I would far rather see

455
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,040
another game in this series than in the Let's Go series, which I would imagine at this point is

456
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,400
probably done. And I can also say I've already put more hours into this, Pokemon Legends, than I did

457
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,280
Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl. That one kind of wore off after, like, just a few hours. I think I

458
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,840
got maybe to the second gym and I was already over it. And maybe I'll go back at some point,

459
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,920
maybe when they put in the home integration or something, but as of right now, I don't even care

460
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,840
about that anymore. I just want to play Pokemon Legends when it comes to that. So. Fifth Dream

461
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:29,040
in chat says, everyone, I love Breath of the Wild. Everyone. PLA, Pokemon Legends Arceus,

462
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,880
looks like Breath of the Wild. Everyone. PLA looks like shit. I get that line of thinking,

463
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,760
but I'm going to be very clear. Breath of the Wild is a far better looking game than this.

464
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,920
But that's not to say this is bad. It's just, it's PlayStation 3 good. It's not really pushing

465
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,720
the envelope graphically or anything like that. So, and Breath of the Wild was a better looking

466
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,360
game. But this has, this has that sort of style to it. And again, I think we're having a lot of

467
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:04,080
arguments and stuff about the things that are wrong with it. There's a lot that's really right

468
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,960
with it. I really like that there's multiple ways to catch Pokemon. You want to battle them the more

469
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,880
traditional way, wear them down. Great. You want to stealth and bonk them in the back of the head

470
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,200
with a Poke Ball and catch them that way. Great. Like, I like that there's different ways to do

471
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,560
things. You can use items, and that's very reminiscent of Breath of the Wild too, to,

472
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,440
like, distract Pokemon, like start a fire over here, not really in Pokemon, but you throw a

473
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,680
smoke bomb or something, distract the Pokemon and then, you know, do it that way. I like that

474
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,960
there's many different ways to approach a problem. And I think that's kind of cool. So there's a lot

475
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:42,640
of, there's a lot of great things about the game. And the graphics just aren't one of them. And

476
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:49,680
that's, that's okay. I just hope that if they do continue to invest in Legends, which they should,

477
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,200
and I don't know if that means some of these concepts show up in Gen 9. That's still a little

478
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,960
weird to me how that would work, because then I feel, I feel like there's got to be Pokemon people

479
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,600
out there that don't want to see a lot of this stuff come to the mainline games, because the

480
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,840
mainline games kind of exist as an RPG only. So I don't know how that ends up working or whatever,

481
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:15,120
but I feel like there's got to be a place for this Legends formula. I also understand maybe

482
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,400
they don't want to do like a historical thing for every generation, although somebody planted

483
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,280
that idea in my head about a medieval game for the Sword and Shield generation, which I think

484
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,280
would be pretty cool. But just, just the way this game works in, you know, the Pokemon context.

485
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,080
I hope they do something.

486
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:40,320
Pokemon Assassin's Creed. The different, different timelines.

487
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:40,880
Yeah.

488
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,760
For reasons.

489
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,800
Uh, let's see. ST-100 Matt says, we'll see how that Breath of the Sonic the Hedgehog goes.

490
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,680
I'm curious about that one. That's for sure. Um, Mike Def says, I think Game Freak and the

491
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,240
Pokemon company have gone on record to say that they're done with Let's Go, but don't quote me

492
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:03,600
on that. I just see that. I like that game. I didn't hate it, but it's very reductive with the

493
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:09,120
other remakes they're doing. And I think I completely understand the argument that like,

494
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,800
how many times do we have to redo gen one, like let the series do their gen five remake

495
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,520
or whatever. But I'm, I'm just, I'm far more interested now in what's the next legends type

496
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,440
game going to be like, that's, that's where you're going to get my most interest at this point,

497
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,040
even more so than gen nine, to be quite honest. So there's a cute little crossover event in

498
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,560
Pokemon Go. You can catch the little, um, Hoi San, um, Voltorbs in the, um, let's in, uh,

499
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:44,400
Pokemon Go right now. So I thought that's really cute. So, all right. That was my gaming week.

500
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,640
I talked a lot about that game, but I know it's been a lot of people's gaming weeks. So, uh,

501
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,480
you know, we had to talk about it a little bit, but I dev again, if you're on the fence about it,

502
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,280
check out some let's plays, check out some YouTubes and stuff because, um, you're going

503
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,840
to see, it's a very different type of Pokemon game. And I think it might fix some of the issues

504
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:08,880
that felt very repetitive sometimes in the mainline games. So, all right, let's move on.

505
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,440
We're going to get into some news first. I want to remind you, there is no show on February 20th.

506
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,840
That's a few weeks from now, but just a reminder, there's not going to be a live show or a podcast

507
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,280
that week. I'm moving. So, uh, we'll have what we'll have 9 0 2 9 0 3, and then there's going

508
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,320
to be a break. And then when 9 0 4 shows up, it's going to look different because, uh, my whole set

509
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,240
up at the new place is going to be different. So that'll be fun. Hopefully I'll be at a place where

510
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,920
dark soccer and Loki can actually see my webcam now. Cause I don't know if you guys know this,

511
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,640
they can't see me. I can see them, but they can't see me. So like, if I were to do something like

512
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,640
this, that's all right, Rob, they can't see it. So, uh, but in the delay, it's fun. Oh,

513
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,240
you see me on a delay. Okay. Um, but in the new set up, I'm actually hoping I have a way to fix

514
00:46:52,240 --> 00:47:00,080
that. So, uh, stay tuned. Anyway. Um, let's move on, get into some news and, uh, boy. Oh boy,

515
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,360
Loki. This is, this is a fun one to start with tonight. The viewers at home. I just want you

516
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,520
to know that my eyes rolling back in my head, it's not me dying or having a stroke is just,

517
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:18,240
this is just as stupid as possible. Um, so Tari celebrated their 50 years of making games, except

518
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,800
they haven't been making games for quite a long time, but sure. You know, they've been around

519
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:32,640
for awhile. So what's the best way to do that? Well, of course, NFTs, but not just NFTs. Oh no,

520
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,720
that we can't possibly just do one thing that people hate, but we're also going to do NFT

521
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:45,120
loot boxes. That's right. Two things that people hate rolled in the one and they call them GFTs

522
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:56,320
like digital gifts. Aren't they already digital? Yes. So GFTs are like hallmark cards for the next

523
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:03,520
generation. That's funny because no one really cares about cards either. They're kind of for

524
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:11,520
yourself. I don't care about cards. Um, and, uh, apparently, you know, rather than being

525
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:17,840
some small predictable token, um, GFTs are governed by a loot table with predetermined

526
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:27,040
random rates. Um, now what exactly is in these? I have no idea. I mean, it looks like it's just some

527
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,880
10 images inspired by the gaming past of the company. Um,

528
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:44,400
um, yeah, not really worth it. If you ask me, I'm not sure how much these are going for, but

529
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,760
not buying them. Now, Mike Defton chat points out, curiously enough, NFT loot boxes already

530
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,320
exist. Yes. Um, this isn't the first way it's been implemented, but, um, I, you know, it's,

531
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:04,160
it's two bad ideas. Uh, you know, NFTs, we already have talked about that and now it's

532
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,760
loot boxes on top of that. It's just like to make a bad thing and make it even worse.

533
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,360
Um, but boy, Atari sure seems to be wanting to find the money wherever they can get it.

534
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:20,000
Huh? Yeah. So basically it contains one of 10 images and two of those images are the epic

535
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:34,400
rarity. It's just, I don't know. I was just so stupid. I'm sorry. Like, cause I just,

536
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,320
where's the, like, I get it. There's a speculative market for this stuff right now, but like

537
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,560
when that goes away, like no one's going to care about those stuff. It's not probably very good

538
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:53,840
art anyways. It's just your pain. It's like stamp collecting, I guess. At least that you have,

539
00:49:53,840 --> 00:50:01,920
you know, physical PC can trade. You would think for their 50th anniversary,

540
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,640
Atari would have something a little more, I don't know, like something to celebrate. I mean,

541
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,680
since they keep relying on that seventies collection, like you would think that they

542
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,840
would have like a, a definitive Atari collection or something. I mean, I guess they have the

543
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,480
flashback consoles. They did have that Atari. I don't know. There's like volume one, two,

544
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,800
three that was on like PlayStation four and Xbox one, not that long ago. They have that they're

545
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,400
they're sad little PC, the ant stream deal, which kind of seems to be, you know, another big place

546
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,200
where they exist right now. But I don't know. I would have thought that they'd have something,

547
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,800
I guess, arcade one up machines too. Maybe there'll be a 50th anniversary,

548
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,560
Atari arcade one up or something. I don't know. I just wouldn't have thought that there were other

549
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,840
places to sort of celebrate 50 years, which is a pretty big milestone. Other than fricking NFT and,

550
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,960
and things that, you know, most people are not even going to know what they are. So it's just,

551
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:59,840
it's silly. Yeah. And this is being brought to us, I guess, by Republic realm who's sold NFTs

552
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:09,680
in the past. They sold a picture or it's like, I guess, a 3d model of a quote unquote yacht.

553
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,600
It just looks like once again, comparing it to my terrible skills, it looks like something I

554
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:21,920
would model in a 3d program within a time limit of 15 minutes to in time in a yacht.

555
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,680
It looks more like an aircraft carrier if you ask me, but yeah, they sold it for

556
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:38,400
149 Ethereum or $650,000. It's just why there are people out in this world

557
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:46,400
that have so much money and are so stupid. Well, a lot of these like logically thinking it through,

558
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,520
like if you really want to be like, how did somebody spend this much money? My guess is

559
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,720
because it's somebody that's embracing this whole NFT thing and getting in on it early.

560
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,480
They were probably the type that got in on Bitcoin or Ethereum or any of that stuff relatively early.

561
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,640
So probably at a low value, they accumulated quite a bit of that type of coin. And now,

562
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,320
because their perception of what is money is probably very warped by coming into a lot of

563
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:19,840
money very quickly, it doesn't feel like as much money as it does to you and me.

564
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,960
Like logically, that's where I really think somebody ends up spending this kind of money

565
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,080
on this type of situation. Now they have to convince everybody else. It's because this is

566
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:34,160
the thing. What is 600 Ethereum to you that is apparently now like, I'm sorry, 50,000 or whatever

567
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:39,680
it was to the rest of us, you have to be able to, and that's why you see all this real pointed

568
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,480
language and stuff on social media and all this stuff, because they're trying to convince people

569
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,320
that their money is worth what apparently it's supposed to be and none of us believe it.

570
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:59,360
I just, like, even if this, even if they were trying to sell this for $1.49 and not $650,000,

571
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:07,040
it's not even worth that. Like, it's just, it's just garbage. Like, I don't, whatever, I guess,

572
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:13,040
you know, some day down the road, you're going to think about, you know, that guy that bought,

573
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,360
you know, pizza with Bitcoin and spent like, I don't remember how many, what the equivalent

574
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,520
of millions of dollars in today's money that that would have been worth, but it, this is

575
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:27,920
essentially that you're buying garbage for something that Ethereum could be worth like a

576
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,080
ton of money, like in the future. I mean, it's already worth pretty, you know, quite a bit,

577
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:40,480
but like even more so I just, whatever, I guess I'm just one of those, those gamers. It just

578
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,520
doesn't get it. DJ Rama S in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says,

579
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,480
a wise man once said a fool and their money are soon parted. There's a lot of,

580
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,240
a lot of modern things to read into with that for sure. I was going to say forgiveness is divine,

581
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:02,000
but never pay full price for a late pizza. E3 VL in chat says it's, you get it, right?

582
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,680
E3 VL in chat says it's like pogs back in the day. I thought it was worth a lot back in the day. Now

583
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,080
it's worth nothing. Well, you know what? I also kind of put in that bin and I know this is gonna,

584
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:17,520
this is gonna ruffle some people's feathers. I put things like magic cards and baseball cards

585
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,320
and not that I'm comparing those to NFTs. I'm talking about like what the value is to some

586
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,920
people. When I was in high school, sold magic cards. Oh, is that, oh, that's exactly where I

587
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,240
was going is that, you know, magic's been around since I was in high school, not to date magic or

588
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,360
myself, but that is it. So I sold my first deck of magic, the gathering cards, because I was over it.

589
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,760
First deck of magic, the gathering cards, because I was over it and I sold it to a friend for 35

590
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,280
bucks. I'm probably like that guy who bought the pizza for a million dollars in Bitcoin today.

591
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,840
There probably was shit in that deck that is now worth money to somebody in that deck today. But

592
00:54:53,840 --> 00:55:00,480
to me, I was over it. It wasn't worth anything anymore. And so am I upset about it? No, it was

593
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,440
because I don't, you can't sell those cards to just anybody. You've got to convince somebody

594
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,760
that, you know, rare printing with the black border, sorry, I have a hard time speaking

595
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,200
the language because it's been so long. You have to convince people that it's worth that kind of

596
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,800
money. And to certain people it is. And a lot though, like if you're talking about like

597
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:26,240
traditional artwork, like these like paintings that go for a lot of money are typically from

598
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:33,280
like very famous artists that have, you know, reputation or quality of work to them that are

599
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:39,360
sought after. And that's why those pieces are worth so much. I don't know who this person is

600
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:44,960
that drew some, some apes on the internet and made like, I don't know how many hundreds of them like

601
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,160
that literally means nothing to me. Like, and I don't understand why they're going for so much,

602
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:55,360
but then you have like celebrities, like, you know, Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton

603
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,920
going on their shows and saying, Oh look, I identify with this eight because I wear a

604
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:08,080
striped shirt as well sometimes. And it gets normalized in this sense, but I think a lot of

605
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,360
people are just kind of rolling their eyes. Like, I don't get this. It doesn't make any sense. And

606
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,760
it it's, it's not that we don't understand how commerce works and how like, you know,

607
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:24,880
Oh, this is going to be worth something, but it's not like, you know, if I have a piece of art,

608
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,760
you know, a Rembrandt or something like that, and I have it hanging in my house,

609
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:39,200
that is a piece of art that I have. Whereas, you know, if it's an NFT, someone can literally go

610
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:46,880
get an exact copy of that. And in like, it's pretty much effortless. It's, there's no uniqueness

611
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:56,320
to it aside from what a blockchain says, you own this. Okay. It means nothing. It really does.

612
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:01,440
And it's not even like you own the rights to anything. It's just like,

613
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:09,520
it, it's, it's silly. It's, it's, I think trying to find more utility for blockchain technology,

614
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:15,920
which I think that there is, you know, possible uses for blockchain, but like NFTs, I just think,

615
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,000
I don't know. I just think that they're really trying to make it work.

616
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,560
But why put so much effort into something like this when we could have

617
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,920
say improved quantum computing for home use?

618
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,840
Whatever happened to using your computing power for folding at home

619
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,960
as opposed to Bitcoin mining, right?

620
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:44,800
And if they're worried about security, nevermind. I could get completely started on.

621
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:52,400
All right. To, to be fair, I'm done talking about those no fucking time things.

622
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,760
We always say we're done and then more shit happens.

623
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,280
Because it's the gaming industry because the gaming industry won't shut up about it. You know,

624
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,200
this is the show about video games and gaming culture and whether we like it or not,

625
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,920
this is showing up and it's because these executives are convinced they are missing

626
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,360
the million dollar Bitcoin pizza or whatever the fuck it is.

627
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,640
If they don't get their companies in on this, I just want pizza now.

628
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,600
I know it doesn't really good, doesn't it? All right. Well, let's move on and let's talk about,

629
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:26,080
Hey, what I think is actually a good idea in the game industry and one that now a lot of

630
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:30,720
people are trying to compete with in their own way. It's Microsoft game pass, right?

631
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,240
So interesting enough game pass. I never really realized this, but there's probably a lot of

632
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,040
people who buy game pass and then never use it. Kind of like a gym membership. And, you know,

633
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,920
Microsoft has these things on auto renewal because you know, that's how gyms make their money.

634
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,120
Yeah. People who have a gym membership and then never go. Right. Well, interesting because thanks

635
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:58,720
to a recent settlement in the UK, basically. They're going to be making some changes to the

636
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,040
way Xbox live gold and game pass. Microsoft is going to be making a change to this.

637
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:09,520
So if you have not used Xbox live gold or game pass in a year, you're going to get in touch.

638
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,880
Basically Microsoft's going to send you an email or something and say, this is how you stop your

639
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:20,880
payments if you want to opt out. But if you keep doing it over another 12 months, so two years,

640
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,880
Microsoft stops taking payments. Now, well, Microsoft isn't quite doing this out of the

641
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,040
goodness in their hearts. They're having to do it to the UK consumers first because

642
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,200
this is a agreement with the competition and markets authority or the CMA in the UK.

643
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:43,360
However, now where you can say good guy Microsoft is that there's no reason for them to roll this

644
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:47,120
outside the UK, but they are going to roll it out to the rest of the world.

645
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,640
Perhaps they fear that similar things would have come down the pipeline, who knows, but that is

646
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:58,000
something that they are doing. So again, UK first and in an interview with the verge, Microsoft said

647
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,800
it will be rolled out globally in the near future. Although of course we don't know exactly when that

648
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:09,360
is. Also we do not know how auto renewing systems on the switch or PlayStation plus or any of that

649
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:15,440
will have to respond. Microsoft has also agreed to have better upfront information about the

650
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,240
memberships, meaning basically like it's very clear that this is not a renewal when your

651
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,400
subscription is going to be renewed and how much you're going to pay and how to get a refund. So

652
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:30,240
they have to kind of give all that information upfront. The CMA's executive director of

653
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,760
enforcement Michael Grenfell said, quote, gamers need to be given clear and timely information

654
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,680
to make informed choices when signing up for auto renewing memberships and subscriptions.

655
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,680
We are therefore pleased that Microsoft has given the CMA these formal undertakings to improve the

656
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,880
fairness of their practices and protect consumers and will be offering refunds to certain customers.

657
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,400
Very interesting. So it's interesting that the rest of the world is kind of benefiting from that too.

658
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,040
So if you've been too lazy to go and cancel your Microsoft game pass because you're not using it,

659
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:07,920
well, in two years, you don't have to do it. It'll be done for you. But I also would say

660
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,880
if you kind of, if you're paying for game pass and you're not using it, you're kind of missing out.

661
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,720
Like there's, there's gotta be at least one free game on there you want to play. So over to our

662
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,480
chat at twitch.tv slash vog network. Mike Deff says, I feel guilty of that. Barely using my

663
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,440
game pass sub. You didn't even play the new Taiko no Tatujin? Soon, I'm sure. Keep in mind,

664
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,280
you only have to use it once in two years. And then they're, you know, they're going to consider

665
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:38,240
that you're using it. S2 under Matt says, it's just avoiding lawsuits from the consumer protection

666
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:44,000
agencies, which is who MS made a deal with in the UK to avoid a lawsuit. Just makes sense. A

667
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,600
simple email takes the onus off of them. And Zen Monkey 11 says, I'm glad the UK stepped up. Like

668
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,240
a year ago, I had game pass. I forgot to unsubscribe before the auto-renewal. Microsoft

669
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:00,320
hunted me down for their 15 bucks. I couldn't get PC game pass until I paid them. Oh, that's well,

670
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:06,640
that's how the gym memberships and all that work too. So interesting, interesting. All right,

671
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:16,480
let's move on. Dark Sakura. Well, how about, uh, something else online, but it's, it's, uh, it's

672
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:23,840
not Xbox or anything about that. It's Netflix. Um, Netflix is going to be expanding their

673
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:30,640
game library. They're working with a Canadian game agency called rock ride game, rocket ride games

674
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:38,960
to do that expansion. Um, they will be able to play some mobile games, uh, with the partnership,

675
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:46,080
um, to the games that are, uh, available, um, already are on, this is on the Netflix app is

676
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:55,960
Domino's cafe and mittens, K N I T T E N S, um, both added in December from rocket ride. Um,

677
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:02,000
and there are more games coming out. Netflix is saying no ads, no in-app purchases. They're

678
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,520
included standard with your Netflix subscription to promote the service. Um,

679
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,240
and, uh, it looks like rocket ride has been making a decent amount of money with, you know,

680
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:22,240
similar deals like this. And they're really happy about working with Netflix. Um, the, uh, Netflix

681
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:29,680
games app was released, um, well, at least for the Google app store in the UK on November 2nd,

682
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:37,280
uh, last year and had two stranger things games. So do you want to try?

683
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:45,600
Uh, I haven't yet, but, um, I like that Netflix is trying to sweeten the pot a little bit. I

684
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:50,560
like the fact that it's, you know, gaming and, you know, other, uh, like movies and TV shows

685
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:56,400
and things like that. So, but otherwise I had to take out the stuff for dead by daylight.

686
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,840
Oh, well, yeah. I found myself missing the Hawkins laboratory, Rob.

687
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,720
What's the world come to? Yeah, but I think that crows map is pretty good.

688
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:14,560
So I'm glad you think so. All right. Here, let's move on to another story. Uh, that, uh,

689
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:19,280
has been weeks and weeks long, but, uh, important. And I think, uh, definitely will be the future of

690
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:24,560
our industry. Loki. Yeah. You would think that the tune would change being that they're going

691
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:29,520
to be purchased by Microsoft here pretty soon, but apparently Activision blizzard has called for

692
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:39,600
a studio wide vote after they refuse to, uh, recognize the union from, uh, Raven QA staff.

693
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:47,440
Uh, so they're going to have to have everybody vote kind of, um, I think it's probably to delay

694
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:55,360
this from happening. Um, so now, um, the whole company has to vote on whether they should

695
01:04:55,360 --> 01:05:03,600
recognize the union. Um, and then of course, uh, the staff at, or the QA testers at Raven

696
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:10,240
have ended their strike, um, following their announcement of the union that they developed.

697
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:16,720
So, um, that's good, but I mean, I think they're probably going to wait and see if it's actually

698
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:23,280
being recognized by the company, but I'm just surprised that they're willing to do this after.

699
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,320
I mean, I guess any company is looking to squash unions, but.

700
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,640
Yeah, I'm a little surprised they don't see the writing on the wall, but this is completely

701
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,360
unsurprising of the current powers that be at Activision either to, you know, basically be

702
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:44,320
like, well, we're not going to recognize it, but, um, I mean, we'll see what happens after the vote,

703
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:49,440
but, um, it'll be interesting. Uh, I, I think it's interesting. They're under their strike too,

704
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,160
but I also get that like union is like where they want to end up. And ultimately I think where the

705
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:59,440
game industry is going to end up. So I, I think, I think this is all a process. There's just going

706
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,760
to play out over the next few years. And then eventually you're going to see a lot more game

707
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,400
workers that are unionized and, uh, the more and more of them to get there, the more lucrative

708
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,880
those companies are going to be to work for. Especially when they see how, you know,

709
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,920
this works out for them. I mean, if it ends up working out for that QA team, then yeah,

710
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,160
I think you could have more people in the other departments following suit. Yeah, for sure.

711
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,200
Uh, well, meanwhile, at another troubled company, uh, Ubisoft, um, some news that I don't think is

712
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,360
very surprising to folks who followed this game because there weren't a lot of folks following

713
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:39,120
this game, but hyperscape is going to be shut down on April 28th. That game didn't come out

714
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,280
that long ago. If I remember right. Uh, that was the one that was like, it was more like,

715
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,720
like it was trying to capture the battle royale thing where I was kind of like apex legends,

716
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:50,080
that sort of thing, but they were trying to do more with like anti-gravity vertical

717
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:55,600
type of stuff. That was, that was the whole thing on hyperscape. So, um, Ubisoft and announcement

718
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,600
said, quote, we set out to create a vertical close quarters and fast paced shooter experience.

719
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,880
We are extremely grateful to our community for joining us on our journey. We will be

720
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:08,400
taking key learnings from this game into future products. So it'd be interesting, um, what that

721
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,320
could possibly mean. If maybe you see a mode like this show up in another game or something,

722
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,600
I don't know. The game just came out in summer of 2020. So it didn't even last a year. In fact,

723
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:22,000
less than a year before they announced that they were going to pull the plug, um, start to finish.

724
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,160
So that's, uh, that's pretty scary. The, uh, amount of life it was on that. But again,

725
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,480
to have a battle royale be successful, you have to have a lot of people that are playing it or

726
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:36,880
else it can't find the people to do a new match. So I think that's probably a big part of the

727
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:42,880
problem. Um, anyway, so Ubisoft did admit the hyperscape didn't fully meet the high expectations

728
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,480
of our players. Um, and, uh, I think it's because the game was kind of a mess when it came out. So,

729
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,840
uh, I don't know. Uh, anyway, uh, apparently, uh, Ubisoft may still be trying to do battle

730
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:58,960
royale in other games. And so again, this might be something that you see in other titles that they

731
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,680
do, uh, such as ghost recon frontline. Apparently there's going to be one new game in the genre

732
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,560
there. And, uh, the division heartland is also supposed to have a battle royale mode as well. So

733
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:13,200
maybe they'll have more success in an established franchise than trying to do a franchise of their

734
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:18,240
own. But, uh, no, it's not necessarily that they're blaming their consumers again, but it

735
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:22,320
kind of almost the way they phrase that, like it didn't meet the high expectations of our,

736
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:28,800
of our gamers or consumers. It's like your expectations were just set too high. You just

737
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:34,400
don't get it. Well, yeah. And, but I think people would also call them out on that because the game

738
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,560
had its issues. I know, I know. I know that's not the way that they meant it, but like coming after

739
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:44,800
the whole NFT thing, it's like, guys are just, you're just not in tune with us. Okay. It was

740
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:50,320
only supposed to be at this level. Uh, I don't know. Uh, Zen monkey 11 in chat says that's why

741
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:55,920
I hate all these online only games. They come and go within months. Fuck that. Not Fortnite,

742
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:02,640
not pub G, not apex. So, I mean, I get it. I totally get what you're saying because you always

743
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:07,200
inevitably the, all these games are trying to be that and emulate that for other companies.

744
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,920
And sometimes they work. Sometimes they don't. It's to me, it's very similar with world of

745
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,640
Warcraft. When world of Warcraft hit its all time high, you know, around wrath of the Lich King,

746
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:25,840
how many MMOs did we see come out that just flopped within months? I mean, shit, it almost

747
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:31,760
looks like new world is headed a similar way. Is that like new world was huge for like 15 days.

748
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,360
And now it's like, you know, but that's not to say every MMO has flopped. Certainly,

749
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:41,280
I found fancy 14, which maybe I'm a little biased, but I think most can see that that

750
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,800
one's done well. And there's other ones as well that have hung in there. I mean, shit,

751
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,760
EverQuest is still going after all these years. So, you know, there, there are other good MMOs,

752
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:54,800
but I just feel like whenever there's a good thing in gaming, everybody wants to emulate

753
01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:01,280
it somehow. Minecraft, right? How many crafting and those types of retro inspired graphic games

754
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,440
do we see now? A ton. How many of them are successful? Little different there because

755
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:11,680
the multiplayer environment and the always online isn't as necessary with that. But certainly we've

756
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:17,680
seen a lot of that. So Mike Deaf says, at least we got some Twitch emotes for that game. I wonder

757
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:22,960
if those will stick around. That's for sure. Quest Buster saying there's a rumor floating

758
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,200
around that battlefield 2042 might go free to play because it's performing so badly. Oh,

759
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:33,120
that would be very interesting. Ziba SA points out Final Fantasy 11 still going after all these years

760
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:38,000
too. Oh, absolutely. And it, you know, it blows my mind. They still don't have like a free to play

761
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,640
model or that, but they're still making updates to that game, even though the mobile version of

762
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:49,040
that sure disappeared. And Jason points out quite simply, yes, wherever there is success, everyone

763
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:55,440
wants to emulate it. Look at all these NFT stories we're talking because somebody heard that a

764
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:01,040
procedurally generated monkey sold for thousands of dollars. And now everybody wants a piece of

765
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:06,400
that money. It's just wild. They saw how easy it was. They saw how easy it was. And now, well,

766
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:11,680
and look at, look at Konami. Konami should have never made the kind of money they did

767
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:16,960
on that Castlevania stuff. But here we are. They did. And now Atari is like, oh shit,

768
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,800
we got a retro collection we can tap into too. And this is, it's just going to be cause that's

769
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,480
all the investors are going to see are dollar signs and look at all these idiots on the

770
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,240
internet with all this money, all this money that they don't know how to spend.

771
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:36,000
Anyway. All right, let's move on. Dark Soccer, I believe you're next.

772
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:44,320
Well, Nintendo is of course very protective and very greedy with their IPs,

773
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:51,360
with any of their properties. And there is a popular video game music channel

774
01:11:51,680 --> 01:12:03,840
called a Gilva Sonner. And they've actually targeted them before, but now they

775
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:15,280
have been hit with 1300 takedowns for so many different soundtracks, you know, Smash Brothers

776
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:23,120
and various Mario games and Legend of Zelda games. And so the, the owner of this site,

777
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:28,000
I'll just read the quote. I see a lot of assumptions being made by some of you with

778
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,360
some extreme words against me. Let me clarify again that I do not monetize videos and do not

779
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:39,120
profit from them. I do realize that doesn't justify uploading the content. I'm also not angry

780
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,920
or surprised that Nintendo is doing this, but I do think it's a bit disappointing. There's hardly

781
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,120
an alternative. If Nintendo thinks this is what needs to be done to set an example, I will let

782
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:57,840
them take down the channel. It is their content after all. I like the most. Oh, go ahead. Please.

783
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,760
You know, I was going to say, I was going to say, you know what makes me most surprised about this

784
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:09,920
is like, I see like constantly people using Nintendo music in their live streams, in their

785
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:20,480
videos, like egregiously. And I would think that like, I would be most wary of using Nintendo

786
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:28,960
licensed anything in any of my videos because they are so litigious, happy. Just I'm just,

787
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:37,520
I'm shocked it took this long. I did a series of five to 10 videos on retro games for my personal

788
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,280
YouTube channel back in like, it was a while ago. I was in the old apartments. It was probably like

789
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:48,320
2000, but I was with Allen. So it was probably like 2011, 2012. I did these videos and one of

790
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,160
them was about the Legend of Zelda and I'm talking and I'm doing all this stuff, but yeah, the

791
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:57,280
Nintendo music is there because I'm playing Legend of Zelda. Oh, Nintendo copyright claimed it like

792
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:02,000
that. I don't particularly care because I'm not really in the business to make money. But I

793
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,160
thought that was very interesting. That was like, all right, well, I guess, okay. Nintendo is very

794
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:12,000
much like nobody's profiting off this, but us. But I also understand it is their game, whatever.

795
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:19,200
I like, at least in this story, I feel like the content or it feels weird to say content creator

796
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:23,120
because they're not really creating anything, but I would say the YouTube channel owner.

797
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:30,240
I think they have a measured approach. They get it. They're like, I just want a way to listen

798
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:35,040
to Nintendo music. And I get it is Nintendo's music. If they want to take it down, okay.

799
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:40,080
But why it, and I get it, it frustrates them as I think it frustrates a lot of us.

800
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,760
There isn't another way to just listen to Nintendo jams. However, Nintendo wants to make that money.

801
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:50,080
I think there's that frustration because we see Nintendo copyright claiming a lot of this shit

802
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:57,760
to hold onto it and be like, you know, my precious and not do anything with it, but hold it in their

803
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,600
hand. And that's what frustrates people. And what's also frustrating about it is that Nintendo

804
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,720
is perfectly within their rights to do that. But that doesn't mean people aren't going to find

805
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:15,680
other ways to listen to, you know, these epic timeless songs from Metroid, Zelda, Mario,

806
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:22,400
and so forth as they need to. I mean, every streaming service out there, you name it,

807
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:27,520
has at least like orchestral versions, covers, remixes, and things that are a lot harder for

808
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:33,520
Nintendo to touch. But yeah, the originals, it's really, really, they just, they don't want that

809
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,440
for whatever reason. Quest Buster in chat says, to be honest, I'm surprised it took

810
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:43,200
this long. Kind of same. Also, I wish Nintendo gave us more options to actually buy their music.

811
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:49,520
Yes. And that's what I'm hearing in the YouTube channel owner's comments. That's what the

812
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,000
frustration is. At least put the music up on streaming services then, or if you think the

813
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,080
streaming services don't pay enough, you know what? Put it on a part of the Nintendo online

814
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:06,960
subscription, a Nintendo music player. Oh my God, what a novel idea. Okay, sure. It's going to take

815
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,440
a little bit of development time to build that, but you know what? I don't think it would take

816
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,520
a ton and there's going to be a lot of people that would be super into that. How many of you

817
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:22,160
would be down for a Nintendo music player as a part of your online Switch membership?

818
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,680
Technically, they've already kind of got one in Smash Brothers. I mean,

819
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:31,200
yes, I see Bobby Blackwell pointing that out, but y'all know that's a little different because A,

820
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:39,200
it's not really, it's a very comprehensive, but it's not all encompassing. And B, it is kind of

821
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:44,880
buried away in the game, but I get it. I get it. Yes, there is a lot of the music in Smash

822
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,080
Brothers. Why don't they take that out and put it on Nintendo online? I don't know.

823
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:56,800
I would take forethought and they're not going to do that. I don't know. Artificial scarcity.

824
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,440
DJ Rama S in chat says, the problem is that Japanese and American copyright laws are very

825
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,920
different. Japanese companies don't really care about the American laws and YouTube will comply.

826
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,280
Toei hit a YouTuber with over 150 takedowns a few weeks ago. The YouTuber won his appeal,

827
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:16,960
but Toei has now stated, you are not allowed to use their anime for any use whatsoever.

828
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:22,880
Interesting. Jason says, game music is very prolific in Japan. RAA and America's

829
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:28,000
copyright laws are way more stringent. Hell, game OST CDs can actually be bought in Japan.

830
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,720
I feel like we're seeing more and more Japanese companies kind of get on the streaming services

831
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:37,280
though. I feel like in our rapid fire news segment, at least once, if not twice a month,

832
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:43,200
we're talking about some CD collection, some collection just came out. Namco put a bunch

833
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:48,400
of music up. Capcom put a bunch of music up on. Apple Music, Spotify, blah, blah, blah. You name

834
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:56,400
it. It's all there. So it's just, it's interesting to me that Nintendo, again, holds onto their

835
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:03,440
precious. So yeah, FitDream says, Squeenix has a lot on Spotify. Honestly, I think that's just

836
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:08,800
everywhere. You insert name of streaming service here. It's there. So it took a while to get there,

837
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:14,640
but it's there. That's for sure. All right, moving on. Loki, I think you're next.

838
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:21,680
All right. So the Steam Deck has some cool stuff coming through.

839
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,760
No. No.

840
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:24,900
What?

841
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,000
Nevermind.

842
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,380
Yes.

843
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:28,240
I'm wrong.

844
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,040
Yes. No.

845
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,200
She's really not liking the Steam Deck.

846
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:37,760
No, I'm just completely, because you guys talk so much over my, about what I-

847
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,640
No, no, no. I completely understand. This is-

848
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,140
Wait off.

849
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,880
No, this is the whole reason why it's good to have your products named in very distinct manners.

850
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:59,040
Anyways, the Steam Deck, the Valve portable console PC, they're going to be having cloud

851
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:04,160
saving for the Steam Deck, which I kind of figured that it would because, you know,

852
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:09,600
Steam has cloud saves, so why wouldn't this have cloud saves? But I guess that they're

853
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,840
doing something special with it called Cloud Dynamic Sync, which is supposed to

854
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,800
be a little bit better. It's supposed to automatically upload all modified save game

855
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:28,080
data to the cloud prior to the device entering sleep mode. So it's cloud saves, but quicker.

856
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,800
Sure. And then, of course, the Steam Deck is actually going to start rolling out

857
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:42,000
on February 25th. So you can start ordering that soon. When will you get them?

858
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,760
You don't know. At some point. It'll be out eventually.

859
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:55,760
Well, you kind of get to find out about when you're getting one, right? Like,

860
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,920
didn't they tell people, like, you'll get one, you know, in the quarter three?

861
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,960
I thought they already had the orders. Why they already did pre-orders for this?

862
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,160
Are they going to start shipping them out? Because it says you should start ordering

863
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,240
them February 25th. Yeah, they're shipping them out now, is the big thing.

864
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:16,160
Oh, I guess the order emails to reservation holders.

865
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:24,640
Yes. I guess that's something separate to pre-order.

866
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is what it is. They're sending out emails to the people

867
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:33,680
that reserved it. And the email basically says, hi, you reserved this. Now you can pay the remainder

868
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:38,560
of the amount or moving on to the next person on the list. That's what it is. But they paid like

869
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:44,000
five bucks to hold it. It isn't that dissimilar from what I think GameStop has done historically

870
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,240
with pre-orders. You pay $5 to pre-order the game or whatever, and then they'll call you,

871
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:51,600
they'll call you, but there's only so long they're going to call you before they move down to the

872
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:57,200
next person on the list. And so that's what this is going on with Steam. People already ordered

873
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,520
this some time ago, and I guess you could still go order one if you want, but it's going to take

874
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:09,040
some time to get there. But we finally know that they are actually coming out because this has

875
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:14,480
been delayed already. It was supposed to be a holiday last year thing, I believe. I don't think

876
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,200
it was much earlier than that. And it's had to creep back a little bit because supply chain

877
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,360
issues, blahdy blahdy blah. So these things are finally, it seems like it is actually happening.

878
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,080
It's happening! At the end of February is when this is finally happening. Pretty cool.

879
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:36,800
Yeah. So we'll see how that plays out. E3VL says GameStop is one week, I think. Bobby Blackwolf

880
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,360
is kind of outlining a lot of the stuff that I just said and saying every week when they know

881
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:45,600
how many they are manufacturing, they are sending emails to the next batch of pre-orders to pay the

882
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:52,240
remainder and get it shipped immediately. That makes sense. So remember when you gave us $5?

883
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:58,640
Here's your three-day window. Come get your Steam Deck. Yeah, Steam Deck, not to be confused with

884
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:05,360
what I'm about to talk about. But yeah, I know some friends that got one. I didn't get one

885
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,800
because I still kind of want to see what they're actually like and what they look like and what

886
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:14,000
the reception is. And the reality is now I probably wouldn't be able to get one for a while. But I

887
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,000
wonder how many people put $5 down that are going to not follow through with it now. I'd be very

888
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,080
curious about that. We talked about it here. Oh yeah? If it was going to be worthwhile just with

889
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:33,680
some of the things that I want to play that at the time I couldn't play on my Mac. And a lot of the

890
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:39,280
games that I would want to play or the reasons that I would want to play them make a Steam Deck

891
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:44,720
unrealistic. For example, you know how I like to mod Mass Effect to shit and back.

892
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:51,120
Oh yeah, modding is going to be interesting. It would completely eliminate any modding or

893
01:22:52,000 --> 01:23:01,520
using screen effects. Like if I was going to play Dead by Daylight through Steam and I wanted to use

894
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:09,600
you know a color mod or something. I was going to say those Steam Decks will probably get hacked

895
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:18,000
within minutes. No, no, no. They're just PCs. But you can load whatever you want on them.

896
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:27,200
The operating system on them wouldn't work with the tools that exist. It's Linux, not PC.

897
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:33,840
So a lot of modding tools are based in. Regardless, regardless, I would want something

898
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:40,880
that's a lot more versatile. Instead of paying, you know, 600 bucks for whatever for it, I could

899
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:46,720
just spend that and fix my own machine. Will you close the door for me, please? Sorry.

900
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:52,560
Pixel pockets and chat says you can put windows on it if you want. And Mike Deaf says

901
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,000
Steam OS is Linux. So modding is pretty much. I would rather keep Linux, Linux anyway,

902
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,520
because it's a better operating system. But no. All right. Well, we've talked about the

903
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:10,320
Steam Deck. Now let's talk about the Stream Deck or an official attachment, if you will,

904
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:15,840
for the Stream Decks so that Elgato can charge you a lot more money for what some people have done

905
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:22,160
as an at home type of hack. But it is now an official foot pedal that comes that you can buy

906
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:27,440
for the Stream Deck, which is, again, the little multi-button machine. Like I use one here at OLR

907
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,680
to move that little sidebar for those that watch live up and down and change some of the scene

908
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:36,560
shots, run the classic Game of the Week video, things like that. So if I wanted to use my foot

909
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:42,160
to do it, I could with the official Elgato foot pedal. That's only going to be $115.

910
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,280
It's quite a bit of money, but OK. It's certainly, you know, there is something to be said about

911
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:54,160
having it just work. You know, if it's in the Elgato, you know, it's like a lot of the

912
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,520
reasons why people like to do the Apple stuff. It just works. You plug it in, bam, it goes.

913
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,240
Same thing with the Elgato. Please tell that to my Stream Deck

914
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:08,000
Mini that has decided to stop working properly while my full-size Stream Deck is fine. I'm kind

915
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,080
of considering an Excel now. Interesting. Yeah. The one here,

916
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,000
I think I bought this when OLR first went to Twitch at the end of 20...

917
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:23,680
I got a math, carry the one, 2018. And I bought that and it's still, they even, I just got a

918
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,000
version update for it because I think they did some Discord integration in the latest version.

919
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,320
I haven't really explored it, but I think that's the thing that they're doing. So it's kind of

920
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,880
interesting. So if I wanted to, you know, because I'm sure you guys on camera can see me reaching

921
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:41,440
for this thing. And so maybe it's visually distracting when I go to advance the story or

922
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:45,440
maybe wondering like, what am I doing over here? You know, so if I wanted to be more subtle about

923
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:51,120
it, I could have a foot pedal, would make us maybe make a thing. Now, again, some people have

924
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:55,040
made their own because I've heard about some broadcasters that have their own foot pedal that,

925
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,120
you know, essentially just, you know, presses a key on the keyboard or whatever hot key

926
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,880
kind of does it automatically. But if you want to integrate it in with your Stream Deck,

927
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:10,080
you sure can for 115 bucks. So there you go. I don't know if anyone's interested in buying one.

928
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:17,200
We'll see. Let's look up a DDR soft pad to a key patter. And that's what I only do.

929
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:22,880
Not only do you get three buttons, but you get like nine. So that's what I want. A DDR pad

930
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,960
that works with a Stream Deck. How on brand would that be for the history of the show?

931
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:32,240
Like anything. All it is is there. It's just passing through a key, a keystroke. You can

932
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:38,640
do the same thing. S.J. 100 Matt about the foot pedal says Mr. Smoosh would just mash the button

933
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:45,600
or sleep on it. True. Very true. Same thing with the DDR Matt. Smoosh would just plop right there

934
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,600
on the up arrow and then it would be forever scrolling the scroll bar up. The stories are

935
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,920
moving by themselves. That's how, you know, Smoosh is in here. It'll be interesting to see in the

936
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,400
new house if you can, because as it is now, he never comes to my side of the studio. So I don't

937
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,560
know if he'll even come into the office. Honestly, when I'm doing the show, I'll probably shut the

938
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:07,520
door, kind of like Dar Sacher does. So I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. There's a lot to

939
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:14,400
discover with the new environment. So. All right. Let's you know, we're talking about we're talking

940
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,720
about controlling things on a computer with your foot. I think we need to go back to a simpler time

941
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:35,120
when it was it was sprites. Anyway, here comes our next segment. And now it's time to travel

942
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:40,800
back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about

943
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:48,320
it. It's time for the classic game of the week. A true classic this week, Dar Sacher. What did you pick?

944
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:59,440
I picked Wolfenstein 3D, which is pretty much the granddaddy of our FPS games. I mean, if you think

945
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:06,960
about it, it is a first person shooter that was developed by ID Software, published by Apogee and

946
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:17,360
FormGen. It was released for DOS on May 5th, 1992, 20 years, almost 20 years ago. And it was inspired

947
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:24,400
by a 1981 Muse software game, Castle Wolfenstein. And this is actually the third in the Wolfenstein

948
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:31,360
series. So in Wolfenstein 3D, you play the role of an ally, allied spy,

949
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:40,480
William B.J. Blazkowicz, who is an American of Polish descent during World War II, escaping from

950
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:47,680
a Nazi German prison, prison castle Wolfenstein and has different missions to take down the Nazis.

951
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:54,320
It is very, it's kind of like a pretty convoluted storyline, to be honest. It is the second

952
01:28:55,280 --> 01:29:00,400
major independent release by ID Software after the Commander Keen series. Did you ever play Commander

953
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:17,280
Keen? Rob? Okay. Anyway, it was programmed in part by John Carmack and John Romero. So they

954
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:24,400
decided to put it together and it was also designed by Tom Hall, built on the engine

955
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:29,760
that Carmack made. And it was meant to be fast, meant to be violent and unlike any other computer

956
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:37,200
game on the market at the time. Anyway, the game was released through Apogee with two sets of three

957
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:45,200
episodes as a shareware. And the first episode was released for free so that people would hopefully

958
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:50,320
pay for the rest. And then there was an additional episode, Spear of Destiny, that was a standalone

959
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:57,200
retail item from FormGen. It was a critical and commercial success, considered to be one of the

960
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:06,560
greatest video games of all time. And by the end of 1995, it sold over 250,000 copies. It's one of

961
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:13,440
the ones that really made, you know, put first person shooters on the map. I mean, I honestly

962
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:23,840
think that while a lot of people might think of Doom, this was really the bigger one. So it has

963
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:31,280
very rudimentary 3D graphics. It has different levels that are basically flat panes with

964
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:37,520
different divided areas. And each level is themed after a Nazi bunker and different buildings.

965
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:46,000
So you have to go through each area to find an elevator. The levels are 10 for each episode

966
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,600
grouped together by those episodes with a final level with a boss fight. You know, it has its own

967
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:58,400
difficult enemy. You have to fight guards and soldiers and dogs and other things while you have

968
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:02,960
to watch your ammo and your health. You can fight weapons and ammo is placed everywhere. You can

969
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:08,640
pick them up off of dead enemies. You can also get, you know, you get your knife, a pistol,

970
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:18,240
submachine gun, a rapid fire chain gun. And the enemies and objects are 2D sprites that will scale.

971
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:24,800
So it's kind of a 2.5D game. But anyway, you start with 100 health and if you get shot, it,

972
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:29,520
you know, goes down and then if it falls to zero, you die. And you start over with a knife,

973
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:34,640
a pistol, and eight bullets. You start with four lives. You can gain more with extra life tokens

974
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:42,800
as you go through it. So basically, the episodes, the very first two sets had, you know, each their

975
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:50,640
own series. So the first series was Escape from Castle Wolfenstein, Operation Eisenfoss, and then

976
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:59,440
Die Sure Die. And then the next trilogy titled The Nocturnal Missions was a dark secret trail

977
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:07,040
of the madman and confrontation. And basically it's the Nazis want to make an army of undead

978
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:13,840
robotic mutant people and you fight robot Hitler at the end of the game. The Nocturnal Missions is

979
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:20,480
a bit of a sequel, a prequel that talks about German plans for chemical warfare.

980
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:28,400
And then the Spear of Destiny, which was the standalone, has a different prequel mission

981
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:33,120
trying to recapture the Spear of Destiny after it was stolen from Versailles.

982
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:40,640
They did two sequel episodes, Return to Danger and Ultimate Challenge. And those have to do with

983
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:47,840
nuclear weapons and summoning demons. Like I said, very convoluted. Anyway, it began development in

984
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:59,040
1990. Basically, a group of employees from Softdisk calling themselves Ideas from the Deep.

985
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:04,640
They developed Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the first game in the Commander Keen

986
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:14,320
series. And then they were doing more games and more software and did things for Gamers Edge

987
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:20,400
video game subscription service out of Shreveport, Louisiana, which I had been to many a convention

988
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:31,360
in Shreveport. And then they wanted to quit and basically make their own company. Basically,

989
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:37,040
since they had created their stuff on the work computers during office hours,

990
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:45,760
they had to negotiate with their boss and agreed to do a series of games for Gamers Edge,

991
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:53,440
one every two months. Ideas from the Deep became id Software and they started prototyping

992
01:33:53,440 --> 01:34:05,440
their own games. They really were trying to push a newly budding 3D graphics style

993
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:15,360
and wanted to push the limits of personal computers as well to make a fast 3D games

994
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:24,400
that would keep up with what most people had. So they took a different approach to

995
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:28,560
display their graphics. They used ray casting in which the surfaces visible to the player

996
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,600
are calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player.

997
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:42,000
And then John Carmack had his 3D engine made using 2D sprites and that started things.

998
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:50,400
So moving a big fast forward through everything, they kept working on Commander Keen

999
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:57,440
and a few other games. The last one they did was Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter,

1000
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:04,960
which saying that aloud is actually kind of funny. They decided to take some inspiration from

1001
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:13,200
Electronic Arts Deluxe Paint 2 and Pac-Man so they even have a hidden Pac-Man level in the game.

1002
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:20,480
And as they put together their various influences, they made the game.

1003
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:29,520
And so they made music for it. There were concerns, of course, about the violence

1004
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:38,080
and screaming loudly in German and the death cam and stuff like that, but people liked it.

1005
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:47,920
When they did Spear of Destiny, they used a new graphics engine that was licensed for

1006
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,600
Shadowcaster and it became the basis of the Doom engine.

1007
01:35:52,240 --> 01:36:02,320
So that's how Wolfenstein 3D led into Doom. The big, weird, crazy thing about it,

1008
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:10,960
there was the Super Nintendo release. Imagineer bought the rights for the game and commissioned

1009
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:17,040
it to port it to the SNES and they were still busy making Doom and Spear of Destiny. So they

1010
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:24,800
basically put it way off bat. Finally, they put one out, but they had to change so many things.

1011
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:31,200
There is, of course, Nintendo's censorship, so they had to remove all the Nazi imagery,

1012
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:38,000
remove the German voice clips, replace dogs with giant rats, rescale all of the graphics to fit

1013
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,680
the Super Nintendo's. Because they take all the Germans out of it and everything else. What's left?

1014
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:55,760
Right. But it was released in January 10th, 1994 under Wolfenstein 3D, the claw of Eizenfast.

1015
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:03,280
And it went out in North America first and then Europe later. But also don't forget,

1016
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:08,800
making the blood green and then finally just removing it. So finally, though,

1017
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,880
they used the source code for the SNES port to convert it to run on the Jaguar.

1018
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:23,200
And so they were able to take that port, but improve it well above the DOS version.

1019
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:30,560
And, of course, removed the changes for Nintendo. But they had to slow the game code down to work

1020
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:38,720
on the console. Anyways, it had so many different ports. In 1983, Alternate Worlds Technology

1021
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:48,000
licensed it and converted it to a VR game. In 1994, Acorn Archimedes port was released.

1022
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:54,240
There's a Mega Drive port done by Imagineer, but it was canceled because of technical issues.

1023
01:37:54,800 --> 01:38:01,200
1994, classic Mac OS version had three releases. The first encounter, the second encounter,

1024
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:07,680
and the third encounter, happily named. There's an Atari Lynx version that was offered,

1025
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:15,280
but never started. There's a 3DO version. Apple 2GS port that...

1026
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,240
Let's see, it looks like they had some licensing problems with that one.

1027
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:24,880
There's an open source iOS port that was done by Carmack himself in 2009.

1028
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:31,520
An unofficial port for the Game Boy Color in 2016. An Android port titled Wolfenstein 3D Touch,

1029
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:38,640
later renamed EC Wolf. There's Game Boy Advance, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network.

1030
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,320
And the iOS port was the only one that had Spirit of Destiny. And then in 2007,

1031
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:50,640
there was a Steam release for PC, Mac OS, and Linux that had all of the FormGen episodes.

1032
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:58,560
Bethesda, which bought id in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of Wolfenstein 3D with a

1033
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:03,680
free-to-play browser version of the game in 2012, although it was removed a year later.

1034
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:12,480
Also, don't forget, Doom had, I think it was level 37, if I remember right,

1035
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:18,240
was a secret castle, sorry, Wolfenstein 3D level. Do you remember that?

1036
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:23,600
I do. I do remember, I don't remember if it was like 1-1 in this game that was remade in Doom,

1037
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:26,640
but I remember one of the levels was straight out of this game. It was like a hidden thing.

1038
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:33,040
You had to do like, id, dls something, I think. Because I remember,

1039
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,960
I think there are codes that were in Doom. Some of them worked in Wolfenstein 3D, I think.

1040
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:45,280
Yeah. Well, I remember that Wolfenstein 3D was also extremely moddable, hackable, and like-

1041
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,760
Oh, totally.

1042
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:51,120
I remember sticking around with a map editor for this game and having so much fun. And I remember

1043
01:39:51,120 --> 01:40:00,560
the Mortal Kombat mod that was really legendary for this game. Yeah, this really defines several

1044
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:03,680
years of PC gaming growing up for many of us, honestly.

1045
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:08,560
Oh, for sure. Well, and there's a little bit more, too. They had hoped it would make around

1046
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:18,160
$60,000. Their first royalty check was $100,000. The game was selling about 4,000 copies a month

1047
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:28,480
by mail order. It was the top shareware seller of 1992, according to PC Zone. And by the end of

1048
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:37,360
1993, with the Apogee episodes and Spear of Destiny, they sold over 100,000 units each,

1049
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:42,240
and the Apogee game was still selling very strongly into the next year. By mid-1994,

1050
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:48,720
150,000 shareware copies were registered, and it had sold another 150,000 retail copies of Spear

1051
01:40:48,720 --> 01:41:00,640
of Destiny. However, 20% of the sales were from outside the US, even though the marketing for the

1052
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:06,560
non-English areas was really weak, and the game was banned from sale in Germany because of Nazi

1053
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:12,480
symbols because their federal department for media harmful to young persons made it illegal.

1054
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:17,920
Famitsu removed the game, reviewed it five months after release, and said,

1055
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:22,640
view from the character's point of view. It's a real shooter. The game is easy to play,

1056
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:29,280
and it runs well. This is the only game of its type. And to get an American-made game,

1057
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:33,200
getting a good review from Famitsu is a pretty big deal, just saying.

1058
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:34,260
Yeah.

1059
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:39,760
But yeah, not all the ports. So the early ports got really high reviews,

1060
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:46,560
but their sales were not super great. The SNES one was considered a really good

1061
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:51,760
conversion for what it was. Had all the music, the levels. It was still as fun,

1062
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:59,520
even though the censorship was there. The Jaguar version was also highly well received,

1063
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:05,280
but they did criticize some of the character movement and made it not as fun to play.

1064
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:12,240
And the game itself, though, has aged so well, especially the 3DO version,

1065
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:21,520
that they compare it to things like Hexen, Beyond Heretic, and Doom. But now it's a little old hat.

1066
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:28,160
But at any rate, this is the game that spawned a legacy. I mean, we have

1067
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:38,720
I mean, the thing is, is that there I don't know if they were able to re-release it in Germany

1068
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:46,640
because of their software ratings board, but I think, oh yeah, in May 2018, a ruling

1069
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:57,520
said that it was allowable in-game content. So the ban was reversed, and Wolfenstein 3D

1070
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:05,200
decision was considered to be outdated, and that games could, as a form of, I guess, of art,

1071
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:16,800
it could be released. And so in November 2019, so we're talking, you know, what,

1072
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:25,680
I can math, 17 years after its initial release, it was finally removed from the ban list in Germany.

1073
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:33,680
And this engine was licensed to other developers, like the Commander Keen engine. So other games

1074
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:39,520
were Blake Stone, Quarter 7, Operation Body Count, Super 3D, Noah's Ark.

1075
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:48,720
Okay, I always wondered why that game felt so much like Wolfenstein. Okay, I didn't realize

1076
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:55,840
they had Rise of the Triad. That's amazing. It was actually, Apogee intended an expansion pack

1077
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:00,400
that was called Rise of the Triad Wolfenstein 3D Part 2, but because the engine had been enhanced,

1078
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:08,640
it was just released as Rise of the Triad. We had another prototype of the engine we

1079
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:17,440
used to make Catacomb Adventure series. And then later on, the mods of Wolfenstein actually led

1080
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:24,960
id Software to create other titles that went into, I mean, part of it was Doom, the Quake series,

1081
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:30,560
and they left them to be modifiable because fans were having so much fun with it.

1082
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,600
I remember playing Gachomon Quake for a very long time in Sailor Moon Doom,

1083
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:43,680
you know, but it led to, you know, different imitators like Ken's Labyrinth, Nightmare 3D,

1084
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:47,360
the Terminator Rampage, Terminal Terror, and Fortress of Dr. Radayaki.

1085
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:52,160
And then we had the reboot. We had Return to Castle Wolfenstein.

1086
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:56,480
We had Wolfenstein Youngblood and Wolfenstein Cyberpilot.

1087
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:06,160
Because remember, if you can't kill Hitler in Bionic Commando, you can do it in Wolfenstein.

1088
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,800
All right, well, there it is. Lengthy segment, but because there's a lot to say about this game,

1089
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:18,320
Wolfenstein 3D is definitely one of the all-time classics of, you know, certainly PC gaming,

1090
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:22,160
at least I certainly remember. I remember this, you know, playing this in high school,

1091
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:25,440
downloading it from the local BBS, playing the shit out of this game. And then, of course,

1092
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:30,160
when all the mods came out, it was really open season. But, you know, it is interesting the

1093
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:34,240
things you kind of learn about it later on is that, you know, the fact that, you know,

1094
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:42,480
as you were explaining, how it manipulates basically 2D sprites in a 3D space, you know,

1095
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:48,240
it's kind of like Super Nintendo's Mode 7, like, amped up is basically how this game gets away

1096
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:53,280
with what it's getting away with. But you really see it like how the lights look the same, no

1097
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:57,920
matter what angle you're looking at it. What's that? It's not like Mode 7. Mode 7 is scaling

1098
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:04,160
of 2D graphics. This is 3D. Well, right. And I did say it's not Mode 7, but like a super,

1099
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:08,880
but it's that same concept of taking 2D sprites and manipulating them in kind of like a, I guess,

1100
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:14,320
a 3D way. Although I guess, you know, Mode 7, if it never really changed the sprite,

1101
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:19,360
it was just kind of like how the system was looking at it. But anyway. And then, of course,

1102
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:23,680
you know, Doom comes out later that is that true 3D sort of game. But, of course, we don't get to

1103
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:28,880
Doom without this. And, you know, as you pointed out, especially when it came to the mods and,

1104
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,800
you know, a lot of the other things that were born of this era that I think a lot of us miss

1105
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:38,560
sometimes. You know, you were talking about the chat room was talking about the no clipping stuff

1106
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:43,680
being a code that was in the sky. I forgot about that, but God, yes. I mean, that that was early

1107
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:50,720
speed running for me. Using IDD clip or no clip, ID no clip or whatever the hell the code was

1108
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:55,920
to just get from start to finish as fast as you fucking can. Just bearing through the walls,

1109
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,840
not giving a shit about any of the mobs that were in the way or anything like that. It was just.

1110
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,320
But we know the best codes. Yeah. IDDQD and IDBFG.

1111
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:10,400
There you go. There you go. I remember them to this day, just like I remember in Hexen,

1112
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:17,600
you can use chicken. And that. God mode is typing Satan.

1113
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:24,320
All right. Those are the days. Yeah, those are the days. Now get off my lawn. All right.

1114
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:30,960
Your classic Wolfenstein 3D, which somehow had never been a pick before. That was the

1115
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,000
somebody early on said that in chat. This hasn't been picked before. And

1116
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:40,080
that's always like here. Here we are. We're in our nine hundreds now. We started this segment

1117
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:45,680
on episode 250. So we're coming up on almost 700 of these segments. And there's always a game where

1118
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:52,560
I'm like, we've never done this before. How? So. Fantastic. Thankfully, though, because Dark Soccer,

1119
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:57,040
I know you're like, I think I think I might be running out of games here, but thankfully,

1120
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:02,880
every week new games become eligible. As every week, new stuff comes eligible.

1121
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:09,200
The general rule is that the game has to be at least 10 years old, although Dark Soccer has been

1122
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:13,520
known to bend that rule as appropriate, but for the most part is stuck to that. So. All right.

1123
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:20,800
There it is. Rules are meant to be broken and we embrace that here at OLR. All right. Let's do some

1124
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,880
rapid fire news. I'm sorry. Actually, quickly, I want to get some more comments in chat here.

1125
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:31,360
VXJ6V says, I never played a Wolfenstein 3D mod. Started with Doom for sure. The most legendary

1126
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:35,680
one I can think of. And I even saw YouTube of it earlier today, because when I was grabbing the B

1127
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:40,800
roll for Dark Soccer's classic game, I was like, I wonder if anybody ever recorded the Mortal Combat

1128
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:45,360
thing. And they did. And you can see it, although what you can't see, or at least I didn't find that

1129
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:50,160
YouTube, is somebody actually fighting a boss. Because the only time you ever got to fight like

1130
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:55,920
Scorpion or whatever was the, those were the boss sprites at the end of the game. So those, those

1131
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:01,920
would be fun to find. So yeah, that was, that was the mod, I think, in my opinion. But also the map

1132
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,880
making mod. You know, it was just, it was just a simple program that would bring up a 2D version

1133
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:12,000
of the map and you would edit it to your heart's content. And good times. Questbuster says, it's

1134
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,560
also amazing to see that people are still making mods for Wolfenstein 3D, even today. I wonder if

1135
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:23,200
anybody, I'm surely somebody along the lines like remastered it for 4K and all this stuff.

1136
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:28,240
I'd be very curious to see what that looks like. So, all right. Don't they have those versions on

1137
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:34,640
like Steam though? Probably. Well, certainly Duke Nukem. Duke Nukem had it, so I don't see why not.

1138
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:39,280
So, all right. Pretty sure that's already been out. I know, I just never thought to go look for it,

1139
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:45,760
Loki, to be honest. All right, let's do some other segments here. Let's get into some rapid fire news

1140
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:50,800
and quickly discuss some other news in the gaming industry. Loki. Hey, remember that Mortal Kombat

1141
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:56,400
movie that came out last year? Well, they're making another one. Okay. Must've done well.

1142
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:04,320
I never saw it. It did okay, I guess. It was all right. It wasn't too bad. Certainly not as campy

1143
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:12,080
as the first series of Mortal Kombat movies, but it was all right. So, there'll be a new one coming

1144
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:17,920
at some point, but that's pretty nice. And then speaking of new things coming,

1145
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:23,680
we're not really ready for this considering the GPU shortages that we're running into right now,

1146
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:30,240
but Crysis 4 has been announced. And this is coming out or the coming off shortly

1147
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:36,960
that it leaked on Chinese social media, but now they officially announced that yes,

1148
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:43,040
Crysis 4 project is confirmed and they are working on the game. When is it coming out?

1149
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:51,760
No idea. Just an announcement. Just hurry up and wait. But your PCs are crying already.

1150
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:58,480
All right. Dark soccer. So, Yacht Club Games is going to be doing a quote,

1151
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:08,000
groundbreaking announcement on Tuesday, February 1st. It's a mega announcement. We don't know what

1152
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,360
the mega announcement is, but they're making one. Good for them. They said a mega announcement,

1153
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:22,000
so we'll see. And then Final Fantasy XIV. It's back on sale, except you can't get free trial

1154
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:31,040
signups for right now, but you can do Steam, PlayStation, a Squinic store. You can pay for it,

1155
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:37,280
but you can't test it out for free. No test drives. And there's a new patch, patch 6.08.

1156
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:45,840
Which fixed the sound issues. I'm so happy. So happy. And the Oceanic data center opened as well.

1157
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:51,680
And the cues, honestly, considering the server I play on, I think is one of the more popular ones,

1158
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:56,320
not the most, but one of the more popular ones. My cues are usually not worse than 100.

1159
01:51:56,320 --> 01:52:02,720
So the cue problems, it's not a big deal to wait like three minutes and usually I'm up and getting

1160
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:09,280
a glass of water or something anyway. So yeah, it's a lot of the issues that were there at the

1161
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:14,240
expansion's launch are starting to subside a little bit, which is nice. We'll see what happens

1162
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:20,640
when 6.1 rolls out and there's new content that has everybody coming back, but we'll see.

1163
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:29,440
Hmm. We'll see is a very apt thing for most of the stuff that's going on right now, you know?

1164
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,120
Yep. I'm really excited. That's all I can say. I'm really excited about the data center travel

1165
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:38,240
stuff that's supposed to come out with the next patch too. So I finally get to play with people

1166
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:41,200
I've never been able to play the game with because we're on different data centers. So that'll be

1167
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:47,040
very exciting. I hope it works. I hope it works out. Okay. Let's take a moment to travel around

1168
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:51,440
the world and check out some release dates. So if you don't feel like buying Final Fantasy 14,

1169
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:54,080
since you can't do a free trial, maybe there's a different game you want to buy.

1170
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:57,520
So let's see what's coming out around the world this week. And we'll start with the U S Loki.

1171
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:03,280
We have the life is strange remastered collection coming out on PC, Nintendo switch,

1172
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:11,040
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series and stadia and dying light to stay human

1173
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:16,480
on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

1174
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:23,600
And then finally, Maglam Lord on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four. That's it.

1175
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:29,440
All right. Going to Japan, pretty slow week on the Nintendo switch. There's an English version

1176
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:33,360
of the game farm together that is getting a Japanese release published by rainy frog,

1177
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:37,440
but that is really the only thing on the switch this week. I'm going to guess that Pokemon legends

1178
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:43,200
having just come out, probably kind of dominated the switch cycle there. But if you go to your

1179
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:48,080
PlayStation five, you can check out dying light to stay human, uh, which is coming out on February

1180
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:53,120
fourth. Uh, and that that's it for PlayStation five. I just want to check the four real quick

1181
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:57,040
and see if they get any, they also get dying light, of course, dying light to excuse me and

1182
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:02,400
the farm together game, but otherwise that's about it. I'm thinking, uh, Pokemon legends,

1183
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:07,120
they figured would keep everybody busy for a week. So, uh, nothing, nothing else that exciting,

1184
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:09,440
at least this week, dark soccer. How about the UK?

1185
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:16,480
Uh, just, uh, only really three things coming out on the fourth, um, for PlayStation,

1186
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:22,000
X-Box dying light to stay human deluxe edition and regular additional is like,

1187
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:28,960
um, switch autobahn police simulator too. And then for PlayStation switch Maglam Lord.

1188
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:36,800
Looks interesting. That's it. All right. Just a few more stories for you. And then we will open

1189
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:43,040
our discord for calls. Uh, check out our discord server over at vog network.com slash discord.

1190
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:46,160
Uh, we have a variety of chat channels where we can stay in touch throughout the week,

1191
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:50,080
including a channel where some of you submit your stories for potential inclusion on OLR.

1192
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:55,120
And I do, I do use that sometimes. Uh, we also, we have a brand new channel on the discord server

1193
01:54:55,120 --> 01:55:00,160
this week, uh, for, for all the dead celebrity posts, because things are getting a little

1194
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:05,920
depressing because every day it was like somebody was dying and what just today we,

1195
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:10,800
we had our first post in the new channel. Howard has been passed away, which is, you know,

1196
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:16,640
if you ever watched reruns of WKRP in Cincinnati, you know, how Howard has been Johnny fever. Yep.

1197
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:21,920
Um, and, uh, also he had another big, you know, he was the teacher and head of the class was the

1198
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:26,720
other big role he had. Uh, and then of course I remember him from clue. He had an uncredited

1199
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:30,480
cameo in clue or, well, he might've been in the credits, but like he wasn't advertised in the

1200
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:35,360
movie. He was the chief of police at the end. Yeah. Our lives are in danger. You beat Nick.

1201
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:40,080
He was the, he was the guy trying to, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, which I can,

1202
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:48,640
I can recite the entire movie clue by memory. So don't try me. Uh, but yeah. No thanks. I just

1203
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:55,280
need to, uh, powder my nose. All right. I played Mrs. Peacock in the last shadow cast,

1204
01:55:55,360 --> 01:56:01,360
which is why I said the line. That was, it's, it's one of the few times I've done drag,

1205
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:08,320
but I'm going to say I was, I was a damn good drag queen. I was all of my makeup was done by

1206
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:14,080
one of the local Kings. Uh, shout out to serve Vicks who, uh, made a, uh, which I love that name

1207
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:18,080
by the way for a dragging, but, uh, shout out for making me as nice as I looked, but yeah,

1208
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:27,600
that was a fun show. All right. Uh, let's do no longer Vic knives. Um, so as a performer,

1209
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:35,760
they are cervix and as a craft maker and that they are Vic knives. So gotcha. Okay. Okay. Um,

1210
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:41,520
going into some other news, Loki was starting off with a headline that I saw this and I thought it

1211
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:48,960
was cute. Yeah. As, as if you couldn't love the developers of, uh, Joe danger and no man's sky

1212
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:55,920
even more. Um, now five years ago, it was easy to hate them, but now, now you can't help but

1213
01:56:55,920 --> 01:57:04,720
love them now. Um, so Sean Murray had shared this letter DM that he got, uh, from a, a child's

1214
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:08,800
father, um, basically saying I'm writing this letter on behalf of my son, Jack. Jack is eight

1215
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:13,120
years old is about the sweetest kid on the planet and has been diagnosed with autism.

1216
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:18,480
As you probably know, children with autism deal with a great many struggles chief among them are

1217
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:23,360
great difficulty with social interactions. However, one of the things that has enabled

1218
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:29,920
Jack and I to bond is our share and love of video games, specifically Joe danger, Jack loves Joe.

1219
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:39,440
And so, uh, paraphrasing the issue is that they used to play it on iOS and the versions of Joe

1220
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:48,320
danger that are out were out previously, um, were basically taken off of the app store because they

1221
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:55,680
weren't compatible with the newer versions of iOS. So Sean Murray then, um, took it upon his

1222
01:57:55,680 --> 01:58:02,240
team to update Joe danger so that they could play it again on iOS. So that's what they did.

1223
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:09,120
They put out a new version of Joe danger and, uh, well, so the, the two mobile versions of the game.

1224
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:17,520
So, um, let's see, Joe danger touch and Joe danger infinity. And so those are now been updated

1225
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:24,640
and I guess they did a remaster on as well. So all because of the letter that he received,

1226
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:30,480
it's pretty awesome. Yeah. Never underestimate the power of speaking up. So, um, I think that's,

1227
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:34,960
that's cool that they, yeah, I know, I know a lot of like flappy bird no longer works on iOS.

1228
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:39,120
If somehow you still have that game. Cause they did, they did that. Um, I think it was like 32

1229
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:44,400
bit apps have to be 64 bit apps. I may be wrong on that, but it was some sort of change. They made a

1230
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:48,800
few years ago, honestly, and just apps that hadn't been touched in a while. And Joe danger was one of

1231
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:53,040
them kind of fell into that void where they don't work anymore. Um, but I think it's really cool.

1232
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,720
They went back and they used it as an opportunity to clean it up a little bit. Like, I think it runs

1233
01:58:56,720 --> 01:59:00,880
as a smoother frame right now. And it looks a little better. Um, if you never played Joe

1234
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:06,160
dangerous, it's excite bike ish trials, one of those sorts of games. Uh, it's cute. It's,

1235
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:11,200
it's nothing like no man's sky. So it's wild that it's like the same team. I still don't like this

1236
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:16,960
person first language that they used to speak about people like me. A lot of us prefer just

1237
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:24,720
to be called autistic people. I don't know. It's the kid's father. So that was the one that was

1238
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:31,760
writing the letter. Um, but I should, uh, definitely check out the Joe danger updates

1239
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:36,400
on the phone. Cause it sounds like it's, um, super cute. So, and again, never underestimate

1240
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:41,920
the power of a voice and speaking up and, uh, you might, you might get, uh, developers take

1241
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:46,560
a second look at what you're doing. Yeah. All right. Um, moving on, I think we're too dark.

1242
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:55,200
So Sega is hanging up their arcade towel. It's not, they're, they're not doing the

1243
01:59:55,200 --> 02:00:04,560
arcade thing anymore. Um, they have finally, um, uh, so, uh, we'll announce their intention

1244
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:12,400
to sell their remaining 14.9% share, uh, with its arcade division to Genda Inc., which is the

1245
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:17,840
same company they have, uh, that has purchased the majority of, uh, Sega's other arcades back in 2020.

1246
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:25,120
So this will mean Sega Sammy is out of the arcade business altogether. Um, and its remaining

1247
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:34,000
locations aren't even using any type of Sega branding at all. Um, the remaining centers are

1248
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:41,920
being rebranded as Gigo Entertainment. Um, a statement from their chairman, uh, it, uh,

1249
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:47,680
basically says they're going to rebrand Sega's, uh, major Tokyo locations, um, Ikebukuro,

1250
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:56,320
Akihabara, and Shinjuku, um, before they roll out nationwide branding. Um, for manufacturer,

1251
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:03,040
uh, Sega is expected to continue to produce units of its current games for worldwide distribution,

1252
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:09,920
but for arcade, running an arcade, owning arcades, it's, it's gone. I mean, and we know that they

1253
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:14,400
closed, uh, closed down all the game works over here. So. Yeah. I thought it was interesting that

1254
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:20,160
this is, it was like this almost the same week, not quite, but like just within the same breath,

1255
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:24,880
you have game works and now, you know, Sega's arcade, um, physical locations, you know,

1256
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:33,280
in Japan, that is interesting to me that that one, two punched. Yeah. I'm not surprised. Um,

1257
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:44,000
I mean, I think that even with, I think that the harder hit on it came with the pandemic.

1258
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:50,720
I think that had a thing to do with it, but arcades were kind of, I don't, I don't know.

1259
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:55,520
I didn't see, I mean, I don't know what the arcade situation is like in Japan, but

1260
02:01:56,160 --> 02:02:02,400
anytime I find an arcade, like an actual arcade, it's a unicorn and I want to move in and,

1261
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:07,360
and put it in a protective bubble and never let it go. Well, I, I feel, yes, yes, I do agree,

1262
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:12,160
but I, I, this is somebody who worked at a bunch of arcades. No, I know. And I feel like those sort

1263
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:16,960
of like strip mall or mall mall, eighties mall arcades. Yes. Are like that. But what I do,

1264
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:23,120
what I see instead is now this Dave and Buster round one thing. And that's, you know, now that

1265
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:27,760
if we want to talk about Sega making machines, I feel like round one is going to be the place where

1266
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:31,120
you're going to see those. At least you're in this. I mean, Sega was never really, you know,

1267
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:37,200
it wasn't the same thing as it was in Japan here. Um, but, uh, you know, like there, uh,

1268
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:42,080
Sega's makes a ton of those claw machine games. Don't they? I almost positive. I see a ton of

1269
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:47,840
those and round one is full of those. So, you know, and, and whatever else Sega dreams up in

1270
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:52,320
that space, uh, in the, in the near future for actual physical arcade machines, as you kind of

1271
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:59,440
pointed out. Uh, but yeah, it's, it's weird that like the multi-purpose entertainment space is

1272
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:06,080
what's still here, but not the dedicated arcade. Like it's, it's dark soccer, you know what it is?

1273
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:10,480
It's got to have a bar. That's that's how the arcade stays open. It's got to have a bar.

1274
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:17,840
That's seems to be people want to drink and play games. I guess, but that's, that's how Dave and

1275
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:24,960
bust. I mean, I back even, even hell when this show first started 20 years ago, you, me, Loki,

1276
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:29,680
all the people that ran in our circle, we, it was a huge deal to go to Dave and busters over at the

1277
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:34,320
great mall in San Jose. Cause you know, the Roosevelt one didn't exist yet. And it's kind

1278
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:38,720
of sad anyway, but, uh, it used to be a big deal to go on that road trip and go over there and go

1279
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:43,280
to Dave and busters. Cause we're going to play a Derby owners club and, and all this stuff today.

1280
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:49,040
It was like a big deal. And now I, you know, there's closer Dave and busters and soon we

1281
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:55,040
might finally have a fucking round one here at some point, some point supposedly this year. I

1282
02:03:55,040 --> 02:04:02,080
mean the theater finally opened over there, so we're just waiting, but well, they're probably,

1283
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:08,400
honestly, they're probably waiting for this Omicron thing to, you know, start to subside

1284
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:12,800
where people feel a little more comfortable about going out. And I know, I know that we're going to

1285
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:17,520
have to deal with COVID for a very long time, but it's the whole, what is people come people's

1286
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:21,600
comfort level of going out. Uh, and round one is probably going to open until people feel

1287
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:26,800
comfortable. And I'm sure you're familiar with what happened to, what was it? The, uh, the drive-in

1288
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:31,920
arcade. Remember that I came up on the tail end of the last show. I think they burned down.

1289
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:39,040
Yeah, we talked about it. I got to say though, um, clever work around by them,

1290
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:45,920
uh, not for the arcades sadly, but I heard that they, the theaters opened again and they have

1291
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:50,800
food trucks. They get six or seven food trucks over there to take the place of the snack bar.

1292
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:55,600
And I thought that was clever and I'm kind of surprised more drive-ins don't just do that

1293
02:04:55,600 --> 02:05:01,600
naturally. Yeah. So that's a good alternative. He has a good alternative. Somebody thought

1294
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:07,840
outside the box of that. Good job. Okay. Um, anyway, so, um, yeah. And, uh, uh, DJ

1295
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:11,680
Roma S in our chat is talking about, Hey, Sega wasn't really in the arcade business. They paid

1296
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:16,960
to have their name up on the arcades. G-Joe is the G-Go, Geigo is the company that basically

1297
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:22,960
ran all the arcades and whatnot. Yeah. But it's still, I mean, it's still something to see a name

1298
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:28,080
like Sega front and center now coming down off the window. You know what I mean? It's a, it's

1299
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:33,920
certain changing of the guard that still makes us a little bit sad. Just like when they stopped

1300
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:40,480
making hardware. So, Oh, Oh no, I know. I know the other one that makes me sad when their logo came

1301
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:45,600
down at that building right off I 80 in San Francisco, right where I 80 starts in San Francisco.

1302
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:51,840
When that was Zinga, it's still, I think it's still a Zinga. Yeah. So yeah, it used to be the

1303
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:57,280
Sega building. That was, that's the closest thing I can think of Rama. It was sad to see their logo

1304
02:05:57,280 --> 02:06:03,440
come down and a different one go up. So a pistol pocket says, I like what Geigo is an acronym for

1305
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:10,160
get into gaming Oasis. See, I always, I always thought Geigo was garbage in garbage out. And

1306
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:15,760
that's something you learn in programming very early on, but yes, get into gaming Oasis.

1307
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:20,400
All right. Let's move on a few more stories. I think we're back to Loki.

1308
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:30,160
All right. So this is another example of memes becoming games and joy. We have one now with

1309
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:37,520
steamed hams being its own point and click adventure experience. For those who,

1310
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:42,720
I can't imagine anybody that's not familiar with the steamed hams thing from the Simpsons.

1311
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:48,720
Now you can play it Allah, you know, data tentacle monkey Island or something like that.

1312
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:52,880
I don't know it. What's the, I don't know the meme. You don't know the meme. Okay.

1313
02:06:52,880 --> 02:07:03,520
So it's a principal Skinner is making dinner for superintendent Chalmers and he is cooking a roast

1314
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:10,560
and then it burns in his oven. So then he's constantly trying to trick Chalmers into thinking

1315
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:15,920
that nothing is going wrong. So first he comes in and he's like, Oh, what's all that smoke?

1316
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:19,600
He's like, that's not smoke that steam steam from the steam clams.

1317
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:25,280
And then, so he decides to go across the street to Krusty burger and get hamburgers.

1318
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:29,680
They brings it back in and pretends that the hamburgers are his own creation.

1319
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:33,920
And he feeds it to them and basically said, well, wait a second. I thought you said we're having

1320
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:41,280
steam cleansing. No, not steam claims, deemed hams. It's a New York dial area. It's a New York

1321
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:46,000
dialect. We, I feel like that's been a plot in every sitcom at some point, but okay. I,

1322
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:50,080
that's cute. It's funny. Yeah. Yeah. It gets, it gets even more ridiculous because their

1323
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:53,120
house is burning down and he's like, what is that? You know, in there, he's like,

1324
02:07:53,680 --> 02:08:00,560
uh, that's the Aurora Borealis. And they're like this time of year in this part of the planet

1325
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:07,760
localized in your kitchen. That's fun. Yes. Can I see it? No, it's, it's stupid.

1326
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:12,560
So I'm assuming this game has about as much depth as the point and click adventure game.

1327
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:17,600
Don't shit your pants, right? Is that it? Yeah, it's, it's very, it's very short. Obviously

1328
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:23,360
it's just that bit. They added a few more dialogue pieces there from other episodes of the Simpsons

1329
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:28,080
to get in there, but apparently the, um, the writer of that episode, the Simpsons, Greg

1330
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:35,440
Daniels, um, thought is hilarious on Twitter. So, um, go, yeah, go check it out. All right.

1331
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:39,440
Thank you. Thank you for explaining the meme to my old ass. I appreciate it.

1332
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:45,520
All right. And last but not least tonight, something that, uh, Jason was teasing at the

1333
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:53,280
top of the show, uh, the Oculus quest no longer called the Oculus quest. It's now the meta quest

1334
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:57,920
because of course we know that Facebook has rebranded things. Uh, so if you own an Oculus

1335
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:04,720
quest, guess what? Not anymore. It's now the meta quest. I don't know what else to say besides that.

1336
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:08,800
And how we feel about that name change, but there it is.

1337
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:18,240
I still refuse to call it meta. Sorry. I will, I will only call meta world peace meta. I'm not

1338
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:25,200
going to call this company meta. It's just, I feel, yeah, but I guess, I guess now we have

1339
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:31,280
to actually call it the meta quest or talking about certain VR headsets. Here's that, uh,

1340
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:34,880
see a Tiberian chat says, ironically, meta isn't self-aware enough to understand it.

1341
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:39,680
True. It's just called the device, the muscle that give you the meta muscle.

1342
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:45,040
Oh, that's funny. All right. Let's get to the listener round table. Every week we invite your

1343
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:49,760
emails, your calls on discord over at vog network.com slash discord and any other comments

1344
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:54,800
or things you'd like us to discuss in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network. We do

1345
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:59,520
invite your emails every week. Participate at orange lounge radio.com, but I believe dark

1346
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:03,920
soccer has reported that she found dust and not much else in the mailbag. Correct.

1347
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:11,680
Anybody? No dust. Anybody? No dust. Anybody? No dust. Uh, yeah. Participate

1348
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:15,840
at orange on trader.com is the place to send your emails. I can't even talk about drag race because

1349
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:20,400
I have, I admittedly haven't been watching the season really outside of just a, just the little

1350
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:27,600
clips I see on social media. What are we left to do? Uh, anyway, um, jacket talk.

1351
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:34,320
Okay. I haven't seen that show. Okay. Okay. I will. Okay. And I don't see calls in the discord

1352
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:38,640
either. You want me to talk about it? No, I was just saying what TV shows should I be watching

1353
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:45,360
then? Cause I, I see all this about yellow jackets. That one I see for euphoria. So there's

1354
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:49,920
this clip going around the internet of the girl that's like in the dress and someone thinks she's

1355
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:54,320
in the play Oklahoma and she just fucking loses it on people. And I was like, is that what high

1356
02:10:54,320 --> 02:11:00,400
school is now? I guess. Um, it's, it's wild, but like there's all these shows and I'm so uncool

1357
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:07,120
cause I don't watch any of them. My wife made me watch yellow jackets. It was all right. Yeah.

1358
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:12,240
That's the one Christina Ricci's in, right? Yes. She does not look like herself.

1359
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:17,600
She's a little bit older now. She's not as old as she was when she played Wednesday. She's,

1360
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:23,120
she's blonde in the show. So it's like, she looks like somebody else, but like, um,

1361
02:11:23,680 --> 02:11:28,000
she reminds me of not Amy Poehler. She reminds me of like, there's another SNL

1362
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:33,280
actress that was on there that she kind of resembles, but I don't remember Kate McKinnon.

1363
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:38,880
Maybe. I don't know. But like, yeah, she's, she's good on the show. I mean,

1364
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:44,720
there it's, it's an interesting series. It's kind of like, um, you know, it's, uh, it's like,

1365
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:49,600
almost like a survival drama, like a teen drama and then like a little bit supernatural stuff.

1366
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:54,320
So it's a little bit lost-ish I guess. Although I say that with,

1367
02:11:54,320 --> 02:12:00,880
out having any context of what loss was like. Um, it's all right. I like it.

1368
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:07,440
Um, question in chat, uh, from E3VL who asks, anyone see the Halo HBO trailer released today?

1369
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:10,640
I believe it's actually Paramount Plus. Paramount Plus and it looks awesome.

1370
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:15,840
Yeah. I don't care. I, I did see the trailer actually. Uh, I wasn't watching the football game,

1371
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:19,280
but of course it was everywhere on the internet right after that. Um, it looks interesting,

1372
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:23,680
but I feel like it's another TV show I will intend to watch and then never get around to it.

1373
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:28,320
Um, but it looked, it looked interesting. I saw that they had Halo in, uh, Boba Fett.

1374
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:37,440
Really? Uh, a whole area looked like a combination of Halo and the Citadel from Mass Effect.

1375
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:45,360
Oh, inspired. I get it. Okay. Uh, Tiger Claw says the Halo TV series looks like it should be good.

1376
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:49,440
Don't expect it to follow the same continuity of the games. They said it's an alternate timeline

1377
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:53,600
that's adjacent to the games. Yeah. I got that vibe from the trailer. Yeah, I wouldn't. Yeah.

1378
02:12:54,480 --> 02:13:02,400
Just go in expecting a TV show and cause that's what you're going to get. Um, yeah, I, I, I guess

1379
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:07,040
I should try to watch stuff on TV, but I, I tend to watch a lot of like Twitch streaming and then

1380
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:12,720
I'm playing video games and, you know, forcing myself to watch the book of Boba Fett. It's so

1381
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:18,800
good. I heard Boba Fett's not even in it half the time. No, no, no, no, no, no. He is in this one.

1382
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:23,520
There's just the last episode he wasn't in it, but like, okay. The Mandalorian's all right,

1383
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,840
but the book of Boba Fett's been kind of, I don't know. It's been awesome. I don't know what you're

1384
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:33,280
talking about. It's been great. Okay. You got to watch the earlier seasons and the Mandalorian

1385
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:37,680
compare like the action, the story elements. I have seen them both. It's a different kind of

1386
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:45,040
story. And I think they're both equally good. I don't know. It's my opinion is right for me.

1387
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:50,000
It's it's, it's odd that the, the best episode of the season is the one that he's not in. I don't

1388
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,720
know. Well, I will admit that last episode was the best of the season, but I vastly enjoyed the

1389
02:13:54,720 --> 02:14:01,120
rest of it because I like the culture being built up the expansion of the world. And I think that

1390
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:05,840
is absolutely fascinating. Plus, I mean, Ming Nao Wen is in it, so.

1391
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:11,680
No. And I, I agree. I like, I like the expansion, the universe and the showing like different,

1392
02:14:11,680 --> 02:14:17,360
you know, side solid stuff. I like all that. It's just like, they have a lot of really weak,

1393
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:22,880
they have some really weak characters. The Wookie is awesome. He's going to be my daddy.

1394
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:28,640
I have to admit, I let, I cut my Disney plus loose. I let it go. I canceled it.

1395
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:33,440
The, the, the, I know this when I do watch TV, if I watch anything, honestly,

1396
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:37,360
this is so weird. I can't believe I'm going to say this. I, I really use Paramount plus more

1397
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:41,200
than anything else, which is wild. I never thought I'd say that, but it is what it is.

1398
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:47,200
So, but you know, I like a lot of reality trash TV shows and they're all on there and I've got,

1399
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:51,760
I will, I will give credit where credit's due to Paramount plus they're starting to bring in the

1400
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:55,760
international versions. Like I have been watching in the background, not a lot, but a little bit of

1401
02:14:55,760 --> 02:15:00,720
Australian survivor, which I'm starting to realize is superior to the one we have here.

1402
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:05,840
It truly is like the way it's cinematically shot and told is incredible. So it's,

1403
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:10,560
it's neat that they have that. Cause like, yeah, I love that they, they have different versions

1404
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:17,680
of stuff. So yeah. And I need, I need to watch, I'm so far behind on Trek, which by the way,

1405
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:22,080
I guess that Star Trek cruise that I went on a couple of years ago, right before the pandemic,

1406
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:28,400
I guess they are going again this year because, uh, our friend, um, captain Matt from the former

1407
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:34,000
store starboard power coupling show is going and was like, do you want to go there? He's like,

1408
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:38,400
do you want to go? There's rooms available. And I'm like, not with the house. And I I'm,

1409
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:44,800
I'm not quite at that. I know I've done some risky things, not quite at that comfort level yet,

1410
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:49,760
but I hope everything works out, you know, it's not, it's still a month away. So there's still

1411
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:55,840
a month, but, um, yeah, I just thought it was screening people at the gate. They,

1412
02:15:55,840 --> 02:16:03,040
I believe they are, um, like rapid tests on site. I actually believe vaccination and rapid testing

1413
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:11,440
is a thing. Um, good. I I'm pretty sure. Um, but I, I saw a bunch of like, there was some

1414
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:15,840
gay cruise that happened and people were packed in there. Let me tell you. And I guess they had

1415
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:21,680
similar protocol and wasn't, didn't, didn't spread it. So precautions work. How about that?

1416
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:27,280
So, uh, Bobby Blackwell says the rapid test for norovirus.

1417
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:32,320
Bobby Blackwell says if they're in Florida, they can't lol against the law. I think they found a

1418
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:38,480
way around it. I think you be, Oh, also it's a private company putting it on the private

1419
02:16:38,480 --> 02:16:44,720
company rented the boat. There's something they did to get around it. Um, and I, I know they had,

1420
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:49,840
they have to log onto a website and put some of their paperwork on there beforehand or the

1421
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:54,240
private company won't let them go. So I think that's how they're getting around it somehow.

1422
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:58,000
And yeah, maybe, yeah, maybe they're testing on the boat or something. I don't know.

1423
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:02,640
Anyway, but I don't know, cause I'm not going. Um, but I thought it was interesting that that

1424
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:06,560
is coming up because somebody brought up Star Trek. I'd love to go next year if, you know,

1425
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:13,440
assuming that, you know, COVID is more endemic and manageable and, um, that, uh, you know,

1426
02:17:13,440 --> 02:17:17,360
the, the money situation is good and all that stuff. I'd love to consider going again. I had

1427
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:23,520
the best time, um, before, you know, literally the week before the, everything went to shit here.

1428
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:32,000
So I'd love that. Oh, all right. Um, well, if there's nothing else, I think we will move to

1429
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,760
wrap up the show. Uh, actually wait, I should check in with Loki and see if there's any last

1430
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:41,520
minute stories. Yes. Let's talk about our favorite topic. NFTs.

1431
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:53,280
Um, so apparently there was an NFT thing called block verse that launched that they sold an

1432
02:17:53,280 --> 02:18:01,760
estimated $1.2 million worth of NFTs, about 10,000 of them. And they were basically like

1433
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:08,880
Minecraft skins, I guess. Oh yeah. There was some issue with it. Like, I don't know why they took

1434
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:14,400
them down, but apparently they took them down at some point. And so now they're not accessible

1435
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:19,760
anymore. So you dropped all your money and you don't even have the crappy picture to look at.

1436
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:28,000
So you mean when things exist in a decentralized space, there's criminal activity and people that

1437
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:33,360
don't follow through that exist. You mean in the wild, wild West, there were people that didn't

1438
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:42,640
follow the rule of law. Yeah. Oh my God. People are doing shitty things to steal other people's

1439
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:51,200
money on my internet. Yep. So, um,

1440
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:58,560
that's unfortunate. Like I said, you know, these skins even look terrible too. Just, um,

1441
02:18:58,560 --> 02:19:01,680
you know, about the same amount of effort that, you know, was put into

1442
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:10,960
the, the yacht club apes or whatever. Um, just, I don't know. It looks procedurally generated.

1443
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:15,040
Bobby Blackwell and chat says they didn't break the law. Well, you know what? In the wild,

1444
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:27,280
wild West, I am the law and they broke me. Technically, technically you still own that

1445
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:34,560
link to the image. It's just that link to the image doesn't go anywhere. Technically,

1446
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:38,800
you got what you paid for just, you know, you got your little certificate.

1447
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:50,640
All right. No, nothing happier to end on Loki. Uh, no. Damn you. All right. That's all right.

1448
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:54,320
All right. Well, we'll try to get some happy final thoughts. Maybe, uh, we're going to go around,

1449
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:57,840
but first, uh, before I get everyone's final thought, I'm going to say thank you as always

1450
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:02,080
for tuning into orange launch radio, whether you were here live with us on Twitch on this lovely

1451
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:06,080
Sunday evening, uh, or you're listening to us on the podcast feed at some point throughout the

1452
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:09,520
week. Thank you for being a part of our little family here at orange launch radio. Thank you

1453
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:15,280
for being part of the show and keeping us going for the last 20 years and over 900 episodes.

1454
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:22,640
Now, you know, I can make that joke. It's over 900. I can do this. Wait till we get to 9,000.

1455
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:30,400
Um, I am the law. All right. Anyway, uh, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange

1456
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:34,480
launch radio, spread the word, help us spread the word, uh, because we are the show where

1457
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:38,320
every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here. So tell a friend or two. Um,

1458
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:42,560
even if you hated the show, I'd be surprised you got to this point if you hated the show, but Hey,

1459
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:47,200
some people hate watch things. What if I may say so for anyone who is here for the live show,

1460
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:52,160
make sure you host because that improves our algorithm.

1461
02:20:53,360 --> 02:20:58,320
Yes. And sadly, auto hosts don't work anymore for whatever reason, uh, get better TTV,

1462
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:02,720
have it add the host button and you click the host button and you're done.

1463
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:08,480
Phil of nine and chat says, congrats on 9,000 episodes. Well, I trust him. He has a nine in

1464
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:14,560
his name. So I think we, uh, clearly Phil is the expert on nines dress to the nines

1465
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:20,080
comments to the nines nines, nines, nines across the board. All right. Anyway,

1466
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:23,520
uh, thank you. A 10 is speaking.

1467
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:30,400
Jamie suddenly rolls a new chat name. Jamie of 10.

1468
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:38,800
That's when Bobby shows up with Bobby of 11. Wait. All right.

1469
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:41,680
90,000 cookies is what you get after going on wish.

1470
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:48,160
All right. Um, thank you again as always for being here. Thank you. Help us spread the word.

1471
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:52,800
Uh, our discord server, vog network.com slash discord. Uh, I don't know what else to plug,

1472
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:56,160
so I'm just going to turn it over to final thoughts. Dark Sakura. I know you're, uh,

1473
02:21:56,160 --> 02:22:00,480
going off to do your, um, killing and stabbings and all that stuff on dead by daylight.

1474
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:07,440
What is your final thought tonight? Um, I need three other people to play with me tonight so

1475
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:11,600
that I can be convinced to get my Michaela adept. If not, then I'm just going to stab people.

1476
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:16,960
Ooh, I'm, I'm almost tempted if I didn't actually have things I need to do before work tomorrow.

1477
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:21,760
How very dare you, but hit me up during the week. If you change, if you decide to try again,

1478
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:27,280
well, I've got new days off now. All right. I'll be waiting. All right. Take care.

1479
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:33,360
All right. And we will go, we will go to Loki for your final thought.

1480
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:39,600
Uh, my final thought is I hope this cold goes away.

1481
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:48,160
Me too. Being sick is no fun. Um, my final thought is that I have my first

1482
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:53,440
a one C check since all this diabetes stuff started a few months ago tomorrow.

1483
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:57,680
So everybody send good vibes. No way. I'm not ex I mean, I check my blood sugar. I know pretty

1484
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:03,600
much where I stand. Uh, I'm expecting the news to be good, but I want the news to be really good.

1485
02:23:04,240 --> 02:23:09,360
So I will take your, uh, vibes and good juju and all that stuff. So appreciate that.

1486
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:14,160
Uh, and that's really it. Otherwise, I can't wait to do this again in seven days. I can't wait to

1487
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:18,640
be in my new place. Uh, I can't believe it's less than a month away at this point. Today is

1488
02:23:18,640 --> 02:23:23,680
officially the 30 day notice. Uh, although we told our current landlord a couple of weeks ago, just

1489
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:29,200
to be nice. Um, but yeah, I can't believe it. Very, very close. All right. That's it. We're done.

1490
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:33,280
We're wrapping up. We're out of here. Uh, thank you for watching. Thank you for being a part of

1491
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:39,680
