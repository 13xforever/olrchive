0	9840	Don't talk about NFTs, don't talk about NFTs, don't talk about NFTs!
9840	15840	This week, Gamestop, the once video game turned collectible turned toy turned NFT market po...
15840	19840	Classic Orange Lounge radio fans were delighted to hear that Konami has revealed a Castlevania
19840	22480	and a... for crying out loud.
22480	28680	Sega says they won't release something that is an empty cash grab, like NFTs!
28680	32200	And now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about NFTs!
32200	36320	And the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has
36320	37320	a voice.
37320	46720	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
46720	49480	where every gamer has a voice.
49480	56480	It is Orange Lounge Radio back with you once again for the first show of our 20th broadcast
56480	57480	year.
57520	66360	2002 episode one to today, episode 898 for this January 9th of 2022.
66360	70760	I am Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my co-hosts who I actually I'm going to introduce out
70760	72160	of order tonight a little bit.
72160	73160	I'll start tonight.
73160	75160	Say hello to Techmaster Loki, everybody.
75160	76160	Hello.
76160	77160	Hi.
77160	79840	Welcome back as the case may be.
79840	82680	Yeah, thanks.
82680	85080	So be here and not where I was.
85080	86080	Yes.
86880	89880	All I told the listeners was that you were in the ER, but I see you're up.
89880	90880	You're smiling.
90880	92600	You even got DuckTales playing behind you.
92600	95920	So everything seems like it's all good, right?
95920	98280	Yeah, it's all right.
98280	99840	I mean, considering.
99840	108080	So yeah, so last weekend I had like, it felt like a sore muscle, but it wasn't going away.
108080	110640	And I thought it was my appendix.
110640	113760	And so I went into the ER and you know, the ER is super slow.
113760	115560	So we did all that.
115560	118760	It ended up not being my appendix instead.
118760	123640	It is a wonderful kidney stone, the gift of 2022.
123640	127440	So yeah, that that's fun.
127440	128440	All right.
128440	133520	Well, let me also introduce Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
133520	136120	We held down the fort last week with a no LR.
136120	141680	So there was no podcast because Dark Sakura and I kind of did a chatty like screw around.
141680	142680	We didn't really talk about games.
142680	144240	We talked about whatever we wanted.
144240	149000	However, we were hypothesizing what's wrong with Loki before I got the text message from
149000	150640	you Loki, like halfway through.
150640	154240	But in the beginning we were hypothesizing what's wrong with Loki and a high five Dark
154240	155240	Sakura.
155240	156880	I think we had landed on kidney stone.
156880	164520	So I think I, I, I, my, my exact phrase was, I hope that's what it is out of all the things
164520	165520	that could be.
165520	166520	Yes.
166520	167520	Yeah.
167520	170400	I think, I think it was like that or appendix would be the like easiest to like the most
170400	171400	routine one.
171600	172600	Neither are fun.
172600	173600	Yeah.
173600	174600	Neither are neither are fun.
174600	175600	Don't get me wrong.
175600	180520	And I'm sure Loki can attest was not fun, but, uh, you know, the appendix actually does
180520	181520	serve a purpose.
181520	182520	I see.
182520	185780	I always thought it didn't like, it was supposed to be something like tied to like uncooked
185780	187440	meat and our ancestors or something.
187440	196920	It was theorized as a, as a, um, a vestigial organ, but action, but oh, oh, yeah, I, okay.
196920	198480	It wasn't just me that lost her.
198480	199480	Sorry.
199480	200800	You just like an internet hiccup.
200800	205400	Like when is, no, I don't think it was like a stupid audio rig for some reason.
205400	207840	This is even before I put, I called loop back.
207840	210760	Oh, I thought it was like a zoom zoom call gone bad.
210760	212920	It's been doing this weird thing with my headphones.
212920	221040	I'll need to fuck with it, but, um, but at any rate, um, it, uh, it houses good bacteria,
221040	225480	especially after periods of gastroenteritis or any sort of digestive issue.
225480	232520	Um, and on top of that, it provides a lot of the immune function in infants.
232520	233520	Hmm.
233520	234520	Interesting.
234520	238800	I read the whole entire study on it and it came up recently in another conversation.
238800	239800	All right.
239800	244760	And dark soccer is bringing, been educating us on facts like that for the last 20 years
244760	248160	in our video game, random shit.
248160	249160	I do it too.
249160	253040	Uh, I like to absorb celebrity stuff, so I've got to say this at the top of the show, we'll
253040	254240	get into our kickoff topic here.
254240	259840	I watched the walk-in, the walk, the walk-ins cause, uh, someone played, was it Nick that
259840	261880	played it on his channel?
261880	267960	I was someone, someone did the, uh, the, uh, workroom walk-ins.
267960	269960	Oh no, no, no, no, no.
269960	270960	I don't want to talk about drag race.
270960	271960	No, no, no.
271960	274680	I want to talk about, I was just going to say, but, but I already have a favorite.
274680	275680	Okay.
275680	279120	But we'll talk about that if we have no emails, but I want to say, I want to, um, we do have,
279120	280440	I want to mention this at the time.
280440	284160	So another thing we talked about on the no LR and you guys can go back and watch it.
284160	288800	I did, um, clip it for, um, the Twitch TV subscriber archives, but I do want to stress
288800	291720	because I don't want the podcasters to feel like they're missing out on something.
291720	292720	It got really off topic.
292720	296200	We were talking about like COVID and all this stuff that like has nothing to do with gaming
296200	298780	and there were like two headlines from last week.
298780	301000	So there was hardly anything to cover anyway.
301000	304880	But one thing we got into is we were talking about the death of Betty white, because you
304880	309200	know, our listeners know that we love Betty white and kind of expected us to get into
309200	310200	that at some point.
310200	315600	We had to talk about it and that led to dark soccer, kind of looking at a list of, well,
315600	316600	who else is close?
316600	319320	Cause Betty white was 99, right?
319320	322920	And as you were going through this list of 90 year old celebrities, one of the names
322920	329880	you came across was Sidney Poitier and then unfortunately this last week, there we go.
329880	333200	Um, one name that, well, guess who died today?
333200	334200	I heard.
334200	335200	Yeah.
335200	336200	This is so, this is so funny.
336200	339600	Uh, I, I got up from a pre-show nap.
339600	342640	I got up from a pre-show nap as I usually do.
342640	346280	And I walk into the kitchen and Alan goes, Oh my God, did you hear who died?
346280	351560	And I was like, honey, the first thing I do whenever I wake up from it is I check Twitter.
351560	352560	Yes.
352560	353560	I know Bob Saget died.
353560	358080	Um, but that, that was certainly not on the list, uh, because he was only 65.
358080	360080	That's that's very young and very surprising.
360080	364880	And I think a lot of people are kind of feeling that whole, like, what, like, was he murdered
364880	366800	like on tour and yeah, no.
366800	368300	And for the record, he was not murdered.
368300	374020	And I, I, there was a, a tweet from a verified police thing in Florida that says no foul
374020	375940	play, no drugs.
375940	383100	So this appears to be the man probably, I, again, I don't like overworked, overstressed,
383100	385980	overworked, bad living, a heart attack probably.
385980	386980	Who knows?
386980	391760	I don't mean to be disrespectful by making things up, but sometimes shit happens.
391760	393160	People spontaneously combust.
393160	394820	It just, things happen.
395340	399380	Um, so yeah, and a lot of people are saying he tweeted last night.
399380	400380	Yeah.
400380	401740	It just shows every day.
401740	403540	Every day is, is a gift.
403540	404540	Anyway.
404540	406300	Um, we'll get into our kickoff topic tonight.
406300	407740	Let me go back to Loki though.
407740	410620	Loki, I'm glad you're doing better and we're all happy to have you back.
410620	414860	Um, I don't think dark soccer, I really wanted to do the first show of our 20th year without
414860	415860	you.
415860	420820	And the news last week was kind of eh, anyway, so, I mean, the biggest headline was Square
420820	428680	Enix and NFTs and here's enough NFT stories to, to fill a dumpster right now.
428680	430500	So we'll get into some of those stories later.
430500	434660	I'm glad you didn't get Ms. Omicron while you're sitting there in the ER.
434660	435660	Cause that was my thought.
435660	441020	I was like, you're sitting, you're in the ER with all these coughing people probably.
441020	446620	Well, yeah, so they have at least separated, like if anybody had respiratory issues, they
446620	449060	got basically banished to the tent outside.
449060	456020	Um, so there was, there's, there was still like some people out there that like, um,
456020	459300	there were still some people like coughing and stuff, but I did my best to like stay
459300	462380	as far away from them as possible.
462380	467340	Um, I just didn't like being in the, in the ER in the first place.
467340	471460	Cause like nobody knows medical procedures, like give me the creeps.
471460	473820	And so I had to have an IV.
473820	474820	I did not like that.
474820	475820	Oh yeah.
475820	476820	You don't, you don't like that.
476820	479860	They gave you that good painkillers stuff like pills and shots.
479860	480860	Yeah.
480860	481860	I don't like needles.
481860	483940	Um, IVs kind of creeping out.
483940	487580	So I had to have the, the, I don't know what you call it, like the intake or whatever.
487580	492500	Like I had to have that stuck in my arm for like hours and I was sitting in the lobby.
492500	498620	I was like, uh, and then, um, so then I had that had to have a CT scan, which is pretty
498620	499620	cool.
499620	501540	Um, those are pretty cool.
501540	503980	Those are kind of like spaces and awesome.
503980	504980	Uh, they're cool.
504980	508540	And I was having all the, the things that my pancreas and they would do the radio, the
508540	510940	ultrasound, it was ultrasound, sorry, not a cat scan ultrasound.
510940	513420	I used to say, oh, we're looking at the food baby.
513420	514420	Yeah.
514420	518660	So that, that was kind of cool that the, you know, that thing is like very like Stargate
518660	525940	E. Um, and then, uh, but most of it was just sitting and it was so boring and you know,
525940	530260	I was just people watching, you know, there is a couple like crazies that came in.
530260	537460	There's somebody that stepped on a nail, um, uh, testicular towards everyone was a contortion
537460	538460	or something like that.
538460	539460	And it's something like that.
539460	540460	How do you hear that stuff?
540460	542980	You're not supposed to, you're not supposed to hear what's going on with the people.
542980	543980	Okay.
543980	544980	So yeah, yeah.
544980	545980	It does not matter.
545980	547860	People will say, where did you go to the ER?
547860	549300	The Walmart pharmacy?
549300	555020	Like no, they seriously were discussing stuff like with patients, like just out loud, just
555020	556020	everywhere.
556020	559920	I'm like, uh, HIPAA yo, I mean, but like say their names.
559920	562080	It's not technical disclosure.
562080	567820	So it, it was, yeah, it was, it was all right, I guess, but it's super like everything took
567820	568820	a long time.
568820	573040	So I was there for like eight hours and I remember like I left there like when I left
573040	575060	the house, I'm like, Oh, this is going to take all day.
575060	578900	And then, yeah, you texted me, you were like, I'm at the ER, I'll let you know about the
578900	579900	show tonight.
579900	582880	And I'm like, you're not going to be at the fucking show tonight.
582880	585600	I'm like, so I'm texting Jamie.
585600	587160	Loki's not coming tonight.
587160	588160	Yeah.
588160	592960	It just, it took a long time to get into the CAT scan is what, what happened was, you know,
592960	593960	with that.
593960	595640	Um, but yeah, I'm glad it's over.
595640	601760	Um, they gave me a bunch of medications that I can't really take because I, because also
601760	605720	not only is it, am I phobic about needles, but I also can't swallow pills for some reason.
605720	613560	So it's like, I am just a medical marvel, um, uh, yet, but yeah, these, you can't, and
613560	616040	I tried, I did get it down once.
616040	617480	And then that was it.
617480	622640	But thankfully though, the, the urologist said like, no, you don't need to take that.
622640	626780	It's only, we'll speed up the process, but like two days or we're all out of like six
626780	627780	to eight weeks.
627780	629300	It's just like, really?
629300	630300	It's no big deal.
630300	636120	Um, so that's a relief, but did, did the process finish Loki or are we still waiting?
636120	637680	No, we're still waiting.
637680	638680	Oh no.
638680	639680	Ooh.
639680	640680	So like they, okay.
640680	645120	Like the initial measurement they said was nine millimeters, which is enormous.
645120	652760	Um, but then she said it was, it was like a, uh, grain of rice, I guess, but bigger,
652760	656440	like, so like four by seven grain of rice shape.
656440	657440	Oh my God.
657440	660320	Did they do the sound thing to try to reduce it?
660320	662000	No, not yet.
662000	663320	They're waiting to see.
663320	669120	So, um, as long as it doesn't pull in ever given, they go in there sideways.
669120	670120	We're okay.
670120	678440	I was, I was telling Loki before when I had mine, they did, uh, break mine up a little
678440	679440	bit.
679440	685120	Um, but Dan had one and I've had one in the pain.
685120	687120	Isn't like that sharp pain afterwards.
687120	690560	It tends to be a little bit more dull as it's passing.
690560	694640	Yeah, it's been like, thankfully the last few days have been fine.
694640	698960	And the other days that I do feel it a little bit, like it's just uncomfortable.
699000	701880	Um, and I'll just take like ibuprofen or something for that.
701880	703200	And then that's fine.
703200	709120	Um, the only other thing that I don't like about it is I occasionally, although I haven't
709120	712040	for the last few days, I'll get chills without having a fever.
712040	717440	So that sucks because then my, my abdomen muscles tighten up and it hurts worse.
717440	718440	Not a ton.
718440	720120	Like, it's just like uncomfortable.
720120	722640	I mean, that's probably, it's not like painful.
722640	725120	It's just like, this is uncomfortable.
725120	726680	It's like a sore muscle.
726760	728280	Well, take care of yourself.
728280	729480	Take care of yourself, Loki.
729480	730080	And it's good.
730080	731280	It's good to have you back.
731280	732640	So, um, yeah.
732640	736640	The good news though, is I haven't been drinking Red Bulls for the whole week.
736640	740160	So, you know, shouldn't be, yeah, there you go.
740160	746920	Maybe this'll be a, we don't know that you have to, I'd say it's a likely candidate.
746920	749000	The time to, uh, kick that habit.
749000	753040	Maybe I did want to mention this though, since I didn't get to have you here last week to
753040	754040	talk about this.
754080	758560	Um, you know, we have to go back to like two weeks ago and on December 25th, I had spent
758560	759560	that day with Dark Sakura.
759560	763680	And we talked a little bit about that on the show, but then the day after our last show,
763680	767240	which was the 26th, I actually got to see you, Loki.
767240	773640	And I wanted to show this to listeners because Loki gave me a little something, something
773640	777200	and I want to, and by the way, I actually have two of them because one of them is for
777200	781600	Dark Sakura because Loki was like, you'll, you'll probably see her before I do.
781640	785520	Um, and what I have, let me open my bag again.
785520	792240	I actually have an NES cartridge, a physical copy of this little indie game we've talked
792240	793560	about on this show.
793560	798200	A lot of times it's called Pixel Poops number two.
798200	799200	There it is.
799200	803220	The actual cartridge, actual NES cartridge.
803220	805120	And it's very legit, Loki.
805120	806120	Congrats.
806120	807120	I have to confess though.
807120	809160	I haven't played it yet cause I don't have a working NES.
809160	811360	So I feel like nobody told me this was out yet.
812360	818360	I don't have, I'm not selling the physical cards yet cause I, I don't have enough of
818360	819360	them.
819360	823400	It's a secret advance release for special people, Dark Sakura.
823400	826200	Did you not hear me say I have two and one's for you?
826200	831040	So happy.
831040	835240	And part of the reason I need to bring you your copy is that you probably have a working
835240	836240	NES.
836240	837240	We can play it on.
837240	840680	So I want to see, I want to see it on the original hardware.
841000	843440	So I'll see if we can lend you an NES.
843440	844440	Yeah.
844440	847720	Uh, Tiger Claw says you are holding a one of a kind prototype of an NES cartridge of
847720	848720	the game.
848720	849720	Yeah, true.
849720	850720	I guess that is true.
850720	851720	So, um, that's awesome.
851720	852720	Limited edition.
852720	855400	I'm just, I'm happy my friend made a game and I want to support it.
855400	857960	So thank you Loki for, uh, hooking me up with a cartridge.
857960	858960	That's great.
858960	860920	He also has your, uh, animal crossing cards too.
860920	861920	Yes.
861920	863200	Star Cyrus animal crossing cards are in here.
863200	865080	And I think was there two magazines?
865080	866240	I forgot to look.
866240	867920	I think it's just one.
867920	869200	Oh, nevermind.
869200	870200	You get the cards.
870720	871720	The magazine.
871720	872720	All right.
872720	873720	But I'll show you the magazine.
873720	876640	It's, it's a copy of the cool shit magazine that Loki was featured in.
876640	877640	So it's pretty cool.
877640	878640	So awesome.
878640	879640	Scan the article.
879640	880640	Yeah.
880640	881640	Oh yeah.
881640	882640	There you go.
882640	883640	All right.
883640	884640	Um, okay.
884640	885640	Uh, enough.
885640	886640	Let's get into talking about games here.
886640	889760	Uh, we're talking about the consumer electronic show here at the top.
889760	893600	Not usually a lot of gaming news that comes out of consumer electronic show, but this
893600	895880	year, pretty big teas, right?
895880	896880	Loki.
896880	897880	Yes.
897880	898880	I'm very excited.
898880	902640	This is coming at some point, but we just didn't know what the details were.
902640	906220	So that's the Sony PlayStation VR two.
906220	914360	They had formally announced it now, of course, no details aside from some of the specs, because
914360	922960	this is CES, no price, no release date availability, good luck with that.
922960	928360	But it is going to be for the PlayStation five, obviously, uh, there are some new dedicated
928360	929360	controllers for it.
929360	934400	They call them sense because there's two of them get it dual sense.
934400	940920	Um, so they look like your bog standard, you know, VR controller.
940920	943680	I mean, you've got the ring, you've got the kind of handheld stuff.
943680	948040	They have the face button split between the two controllers and analog six split between
948040	949040	the two controllers.
949040	950600	It's almost like basically having the controller split.
950600	955100	And I don't see that there's like shoulder or a trigger buttons on the top there.
955100	956440	Probably there are triggers underneath.
956440	957700	They typically have that.
957700	962400	So yeah, kind of like a PlayStation dual sense controller just split.
962400	967660	And then, um, of course, some pretty impressive specs on the actual device itself.
967660	976260	So it's got an OLED display with 4k resolution, uh, 2000 by 20, 40 pixels per eye, uh, refresh
976260	978520	rate up to 120 Hertz.
978520	985540	They're going to have 110 degree field of view and also has eye tracking, which is pretty
985540	986540	cool.
986540	987540	And I'm curious to see how they do.
987540	992260	Well, a lot of times with the eye tracking, they may use that for foveted rendering where
992260	997460	they basically render a higher detail where you're looking and everything else is less
997460	998460	detailed.
998460	1003580	So it's a way to save on render, um, rendering processing power.
1003580	1010300	Um, don't know about a whole lot of the games that are coming out for, aside from horizon.
1010300	1012780	Um, what was it?
1012780	1015780	There's a horizon.
1015780	1020140	Some one of their series forbidden West zero Dawn, like a forbidden horizon game in that
1020140	1025420	universe that they showed like five seconds of it looked cool, but yeah, we barely got
1025420	1026420	a taste.
1026420	1027420	Yeah.
1027420	1031620	Um, and pricing don't know what the price is yet on that, but I'm expecting expensive.
1031620	1039340	Um, we got to say is until, until Dawn rush of blood too.
1039340	1045140	And I'm there, I'm telling you, can I, can I say my favorite part of this whole PlayStation
1045140	1048820	five VR one fucking wire.
1048820	1049820	Yes.
1049820	1050820	Oh yeah.
1050820	1052380	One fucking wire.
1052380	1053380	Thank you.
1053380	1056500	Cause the PlayStation four is spaghetti.
1056500	1057500	It is.
1057500	1060460	It's a mess, but it's, you know, years old tech now.
1060460	1061460	USB headsets.
1061460	1065180	I mean, now they have the tracking on the, you know, it's inside out tracking.
1065180	1068140	So you don't have a camera that you have to have anymore.
1068140	1074180	And then of course, everything now can be put through USB type C. So one cord, that's
1074180	1075180	it.
1075180	1078340	Um, yeah, definitely doable.
1078340	1082060	So I, I'm very curious to see what else they have for it.
1082060	1086220	Um, I think we'll see probably up versions of a lot of existing games.
1086220	1090420	Like, like beat saber will have to exist on this thing has to back.
1090420	1094740	Backwards compatibility to like, I'd want to see, like, if they do like stuff with backwards
1094740	1099660	compatibility, I would hope so too.
1099660	1102620	But yeah, I kind of want one, even though I don't play VR stuff.
1102620	1103620	I do.
1103620	1104620	Yeah.
1104620	1106740	I just don't have the room for it.
1106740	1113460	I like enough VR stuff where like, and I liked PS four VR enough where it's like, okay, I
1113460	1114620	want to get the PS five VR.
1114620	1119220	I mean, I have to get a PS five first, but I still feel like this is far enough out.
1119220	1122340	Maybe there'll be a super bundle by this holiday who, of course, whether I can get
1122340	1124860	my hands on one or not is going to be anyone's business.
1124860	1130540	Um, but, uh, yeah, I, it's, it sounds very enticing and I'm, I'm just glad Oculus has
1130540	1134180	a little more competition with something with the higher specs, you know, that's a little
1134180	1141140	more, you know, of 2022 than of, you know, 2016 or whenever the PS four VR came out.
1141140	1144900	Um, so yeah, I, I just, I I'll definitely check it out.
1144900	1148660	I was pretty happy with the PlayStation four VR.
1148660	1153660	And I think just having, you know, better graphics, more fluid, better stuff is just
1153660	1156860	going to, um, be even more step up.
1156860	1159900	Uh, I can't wait to play some more of the workout games and all that.
1159900	1164320	So they said, so yeah, that horizon games, uh, horizon called the mountain and they said,
1164320	1170660	it's actually going to be a, a proper game, not just a port of the other, or like an experience,
1170660	1173100	like a lot of the early VR on PlayStation.
1173100	1174100	Yeah.
1174300	1179380	And then, um, you know, the other thing to mention too, is what those sense controllers
1179380	1183680	is they also have the haptics in there, just like the PlayStation dual sense.
1183680	1185700	So that'll be pretty cool too.
1185700	1186700	Yeah.
1186700	1189540	I can't wait for things like no man's sky to support it too, even though, but the thing
1189540	1194500	about VR and, you know, I, I really enjoy it 20 minutes at a time.
1194500	1199140	Like I'm just not going to play a hours long game exclusively in VR.
1199140	1201140	I just, I can't handle it.
1201140	1203620	Um, but it's great for things in short bursts.
1204140	1207580	So that's why Beat Saber is so fucking good because you can play five songs, take the
1207580	1208940	headset off, take a break.
1208940	1209940	Okay.
1209940	1210940	Now I can play a little more and I'm fine.
1210940	1212580	At least that's the way it is for me.
1212580	1216620	So, um, yeah, so that's more than I can pretty much do.
1216620	1217620	I know.
1217620	1218620	I know.
1218620	1224120	But, well, I mean, I know you used to kind of be like, not a fan of first person stuff,
1224120	1227020	but you seem to have made dead by daylight work for you.
1227020	1230980	Is there, was there a trick there or something different or I just have to get used to it.
1230980	1235500	And sometimes if I'm having some vertigo issues already, then I, I can't play.
1235500	1236700	Ah, I see.
1236700	1243020	Like I had this, uh, one thing and it was when I was pretty soon off of my meds where
1243020	1244620	I was awake at like three in the morning.
1244620	1251580	And so I logged on to play and I had myself like a really, really good pig game, right?
1251580	1258260	In Larry's lots of turns, lots of, you know, and pigs are fast, fast character.
1258260	1259260	Yeah.
1259260	1264260	So I got really motion sick and actually had to step away, take my nausea medicine, come
1264260	1265260	back.
1265260	1268460	Well, I still got a four K, but still, so, but it was a good game.
1268460	1273120	So it's a similar kind of thing ish where you got to do it in short bursts, maybe depending
1273120	1274120	on if I do it.
1274120	1275120	Yeah.
1275120	1276120	Yeah.
1276120	1280740	If you do it, um, like, and it also depends on the nature of it, if it honestly, if it's
1280740	1284180	either too smooth or not smooth enough.
1284180	1285180	Yeah.
1285700	1290100	And that, that is going to be an interesting feature of this PlayStation five VR is that
1290100	1292420	it will be very smooth, right?
1292420	1295980	That's going to be part of the, like the refresh rates supposed to be a lot better, right?
1295980	1301060	So yeah, I can see where, um, that could be interesting, but I also remember you played
1301060	1306300	some VR game at gamer X or one of those, you and I were both there and it was, you were
1306300	1309860	like, uh, you were like, I could play that.
1309860	1310860	Yeah.
1310860	1317340	The game wasn't so bad, but even so, when I was done, I, my sense of depth was all off.
1317340	1318340	Yeah.
1318340	1319340	I hear you.
1319340	1322660	Um, Hey, since we're kind of set all about just about everything we've had to say on
1322660	1327140	this topic and we're about to get into our gaming weeks, um, you kind of alluded to there,
1327140	1328300	the med situation.
1328300	1332180	And I know that kind of like you had your big study this week and everything, right?
1332180	1335300	So anything you want to comment on that whole thing?
1335300	1337420	I just congrats on getting through that.
1337420	1339100	I know it was a difficult period.
1339100	1340100	Yeah.
1340100	1341100	Yeah.
1341100	1342100	Yeah.
1342100	1349820	So basically in a nutshell, what happened is, um, I hope that didn't sound funny.
1349820	1353420	I'm still having some issues with my mic being recognized.
1353420	1356060	No, you're, you're, you're coming through.
1356060	1357060	Okay.
1357060	1358060	Anyway.
1358060	1360060	Um, so I had two types of studies.
1360060	1371500	Um, uh, I'm trying to remember the other one, the M M S L T S R T, um, it's, it's some,
1371500	1373860	it's some type of nap test.
1373860	1374860	Yeah.
1374860	1384540	Um, but anyway, um, what, what they, it's a multiple sleep latency test at the MSLT.
1384540	1385540	Okay.
1385820	1391500	So at any rate, what happens is that they hook up all of this shit to you and it's a
1391500	1393780	lot of wires, lot of wires.
1393780	1398540	They put this putty in my hair to get it to stick to my scalp.
1398540	1400700	And I mean, I had them here, I had them here.
1400700	1401700	They were here.
1401700	1402700	They were here.
1402700	1403700	They were on my neck.
1403700	1408260	I had one right here for eye movement.
1408260	1411700	She's pointing everywhere around my eyes.
1411900	1416300	I had one on my throat for like snoring, I guess.
1416300	1423780	I had another one, um, on my jaw for sleep talking, I guess, which apparently I did mumble
1423780	1425260	a bit in my sleep.
1425260	1433180	Um, I had ECG monitors on electrocardiogram for those who may not be in the know, um,
1433180	1439100	they put, uh, they put monitors on my legs.
1439100	1441980	They put them on my arms.
1441980	1445180	And so that was just for the nighttime test.
1445180	1450620	So now me, my average bedtime is like between one and 3 AM.
1450620	1451620	It depends.
1451620	1452620	I'm just a night person.
1452620	1455980	I'm always more alert at night.
1455980	1461500	They had me go into bed like closer to nine, which is like, what am I in elementary school?
1461500	1462500	Right.
1462500	1468220	So, um, but I did manage to go right to sleep, which was weird for me.
1468220	1474900	Um, and then I woke up at midnight and I was wide awake and I laid wide awake.
1474900	1480820	There were no, there's a window in there, but it was kind of blacked out.
1480820	1487700	And if I had to go pee, I had to, you know, call someone in to disconnect the box that
1487700	1489420	all my wires were connected to.
1489420	1490420	Oh, geez.
1490420	1496940	And I've got all this on, on my, uh, my Twitter and I'll find the link for, um, the, the,
1496940	1499700	uh, it's somewhere on my profile at dark Sakura.
1499700	1502460	Um, I'll find the link though for chatters.
1502460	1512580	Um, so what, um, finally the lady's like, look, if you can't, if we can't get six hours
1512580	1516700	of sleep out of you, then we're going to have to do this test again.
1516700	1519860	And the first thing I thought, oh, they go put that shit in my hair.
1519860	1523700	So, um, I was like, look, I brought my anti-anxiety meds.
1523700	1529100	I have not been taking them except when I am desperate to sleep.
1529100	1530820	Can I take one?
1530820	1537140	And she's like, okay, because really my, my anti-anxiety stuff is more of an anti-histamine.
1537140	1543020	And so it was basically the equivalent of taking like two Benadryl instead of one Benadryl.
1543020	1544020	Right.
1544020	1552420	Um, so, um, also just to go ahead and, and say this, there are other kinds of sleep tests
1552460	1555180	that you can take home, but this one is not one of them.
1555180	1557700	It's not like a basic sleep apnea test.
1557700	1558700	Right.
1558700	1561340	Oh, and I also had the finger monitor for, I guess, oh, two.
1561340	1564860	So, so you got through, you got through the night, you got through the six hours.
1564860	1569380	I got through the night and they woke me up at 6 AM.
1569380	1573940	And um, of course, now keep in mind, I haven't had any caffeine for two days now.
1573940	1575980	Oh, well a whole day.
1575980	1582380	And then, so the next part of it was I was doing five naps and people were like, oh,
1582380	1585300	you get to take a nap several times a day.
1585300	1586300	How lovely.
1586300	1587300	No.
1587300	1589900	It's hard to do just, or it's hard to do that many.
1589900	1590900	Yeah.
1590900	1594900	The thing is that for me is that during the day when I am unmedicated, I will nod off
1594900	1595980	at a moment's notice.
1595980	1597780	I am exhausted during the day.
1597780	1598900	I am sleepy.
1598900	1601860	I, I could go to sleep.
1601860	1607180	Probably right now, if you put me on the bed, I would probably take a nap and it's only
1607180	1608180	6.40.
1608980	1614940	So, um, at any rate, uh, first one I laid down and I dreamed.
1614940	1616580	Second one, same thing.
1616580	1617580	Third one, same thing.
1617580	1621620	The fourth one, I think I stayed awake through the nap time, or at least if I slept, I didn't
1621620	1622620	remember sleeping.
1622620	1623620	I didn't remember dreaming.
1623620	1629260	Fifth one, I dreamed through the whole thing, like pretty vividly, pretty quickly.
1629260	1632780	And each of the naps were anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes.
1632780	1638740	So in between I ate some really terrible reheated.
1638740	1642340	I'm going to ask you to fast forward a little bit because we're well, I just have to say
1642340	1644220	one thing because it was hilarious.
1644220	1645220	Yeah.
1645220	1648620	The French toast that they gave me, I sent a picture to Tiara and they said, it looked
1648620	1649620	like melancholy toast.
1649620	1654380	And that's what I'm calling it from now on depressing toes, but so you got through the
1654380	1658860	whole process and are you able to get back on some of the stuff you were doing before
1658860	1659860	and all that?
1659860	1663820	I'm easing back into my meds.
1663820	1671340	Just because if I can get away with taking fewer or smaller doses, I would prefer to
1671340	1679700	do that, but I already, I'll just go ahead and say what I'm on.
1679700	1682700	The four things that I had to quit taking was Zoloft.
1682700	1684500	I don't care.
1684500	1685500	Normalize it.
1685500	1686500	Right?
1686500	1687500	True.
1687500	1691820	Zoloft and for anyone out there who has to take an SSRI, there's no shame in it.
1691820	1695780	If you need medication, take it.
1695780	1698460	I went back to taking half of my regular dose.
1698460	1704780	I am now taking 75% of my regular dose and I'm feeling pretty okay on it.
1704780	1708520	I take Provigil, which is something that they give to people with narcolepsy, but they also
1708520	1712780	give it to people with chronic fatigue syndrome, which I have been diagnosed with.
1712780	1713800	I'm taking less of it.
1713800	1718360	I'm actually needing less of it than I used to to stay awake during the day.
1718360	1720040	That's excellent.
1720040	1728320	I take a sleeping medication called Trazodone and I was taking four of them a night to sleep.
1728320	1731720	I am now getting to sleep with one of them and staying asleep.
1731720	1734600	The weaning has actually been good for me.
1734600	1736160	Then I take another one called Prazosin.
1736160	1742080	I am taking my same dose of that and that's something that I take for PTSD.
1742080	1748760	I do not mind talking about my medications because honestly, if I can normalize mental
1748760	1757040	issues and show everybody that you can be on them and be a regular, well, I'm not regular,
1757040	1758120	but you know what I mean?
1758120	1761160	A mostly regular person.
1761160	1766480	But anyone can be on medication, whether or not you think that they are, and it's something
1766480	1768020	that needs to be normalized.
1768020	1770620	People need to be able to talk about.
1770620	1773420	That is all true, but it is still your business at the end of the day.
1773420	1774420	And I don't care.
1774420	1779100	For me, if I'm in a position that I can help people normalize their treatment and normalize
1779100	1783380	dealing with mental issues, I'm all for it.
1783380	1788980	And the thing is, is that all four of those that I was on are also used to treat narcolepsy.
1788980	1795540	They cannot see if I have narcolepsy until they take me off the stuff that treats narcolepsy.
1795540	1798540	I get it.
1798540	1801340	That's kind of the whole thing behind it.
1801340	1803060	And I'm still not doing any driving right now.
1803060	1804540	I'm not exactly safe to drive.
1804540	1809280	I'm still having slightly catapletic moments.
1809280	1812500	I'm not really sure what to wish somebody that's been through your situation.
1812500	1815420	I don't think I can say like, gosh, I hope the test results were good.
1815420	1818220	I just, I hope you get answers.
1818220	1824060	I hope you get answers and it puts the puzzle together for the doctors and all that good
1824060	1825060	stuff.
1825060	1827500	Well, hopefully I'll get the results soon.
1827500	1828660	I'm off for another week.
1828660	1835460	So I did take the Wednesday night after my test, I took that off from streaming and I
1835460	1839180	took last night off from streaming.
1839180	1845460	But in streaming notes, I only have three more days to go till I hit the 25 out of 30
1845460	1846460	day thing.
1846460	1849620	And I'm doing a joinathon on Wednesday.
1849620	1850620	This Wednesday?
1850620	1851620	Yeah, this Wednesday.
1851620	1852620	How fun.
1852620	1856140	It's basically just going to be like a random little half-assed marathon.
1856140	1857940	And if people want to follow, great.
1857940	1858940	I've got some prizes.
1858940	1862040	If people want to subscribe, great.
1862040	1864100	I have prizes.
1864100	1867620	But mostly I just want to hang out and bullshit.
1867620	1868620	Sounds good.
1868620	1872960	What's with, why don't you, oh boy, why don't you tell us about the rest of your gaming
1872960	1874820	week as we're getting into the segment.
1874820	1877440	Tell us about the other types of games you've been playing this week.
1877440	1880520	I've actually been playing a lot of games.
1880520	1885000	First of all, I started Cyberpunk 2077 since it's on Stadia.
1885000	1889000	It plays very stably.
1889000	1893080	The car steers like shit with a keyboard and it won't let me use a controller.
1893080	1894080	Oh, wild.
1894080	1898120	And I even hooked, for those who are watching, I even hooked this sucker up.
1898120	1903720	My Street Fighter Wii wired Xbox controller.
1903720	1908600	That's interesting because, you know, I remember early on when all the crazy like graphic issues
1908600	1912640	and bugs were happening with Cyberpunk, a lot of people were saying, hey, this is the
1912640	1917220	best case used for Stadia yet because Stadia is the best place to play it.
1917220	1921000	It's the least broken there because, you know, you're running on a relatively uber computers,
1921000	1924600	but it's interesting that you ran into kind of the other issue about you can't really
1924600	1926280	control it the way you want to.
1926280	1929680	Yeah, but that's still not as big of a deal to me.
1929680	1933960	I just lowered the steering sensitivity and it's kind of all right.
1933960	1939840	But yeah, the steering sensitive and there's a lot more buttons to remember.
1939840	1943120	I kind of had to put myself a little bit into a Mass Effect thing, but I do hate that
1943120	1944280	it's first person.
1944280	1946240	I desperately hate that it's first person.
1946240	1949720	And if I could find a way to make it third person, I would do it.
1949720	1952980	So I didn't play a whole lot of it.
1952980	1954520	It's got some interesting factors in.
1954520	1955560	It could be a good game.
1955560	1956800	I don't know if I'm going to stick with it.
1956800	1964120	I might actually go play Avengers next, but I've also been just sort of working my way
1964120	1966760	through some of my Steam games as well.
1966760	1970680	I had this game called Demons Tilt.
1970680	1972120	That's a pinball game, right?
1972120	1973120	It is a pinball game.
1973120	1977040	It is a spiritual successor to the Crush series.
1977040	1983080	So Alien Crush, Devil's Crush, and Jockey Crush.
1983080	1984840	Oh, I didn't know those were related.
1984840	1986000	That's cool.
1986000	1987220	It's a spiritual.
1987220	1993360	I don't think it's by the same people, but it's definitely in that style.
1993360	1998640	It feels like playing Devil's Crush or Alien Crush or any of them.
1998640	2000040	It's a lot of fun.
2000040	2006160	I've got a VOD of it on my channel from playing it, and I think that's actually going to become
2006160	2014060	just like a regular casual thing for me to play on a stream, because like I said a few
2014060	2019760	weeks ago, when my work schedule changes, my streaming schedule changes, and I'm going
2019760	2023960	to try to do something that's a little bit more sustainable to get people in at different
2023960	2024960	times.
2024960	2025960	Okay, cool.
2025960	2032000	Yeah, I might even, except for my post-OLR stream, I might be going like at four o'clock.
2032000	2033000	Oh, wow.
2033000	2034000	Okay.
2034000	2035000	Yeah.
2035000	2039360	Because then my East Coast buddies can hang out with me.
2039360	2042380	But I've also still been playing a lot of Dead by Daylight.
2042380	2043380	I got...
2043380	2044380	Okay, okay, okay.
2044380	2046380	Dead by Daylight talk.
2046380	2047380	Quickly.
2047380	2048640	Okay.
2048640	2053040	You know who my worst character is?
2053040	2055360	Everybody's worst character, practically, Nurse.
2055360	2056360	Nurse, yeah.
2056360	2062220	I played my very fifth ever game of Nurse, and I had gone through and just put everybody
2062220	2066800	on their default perks just so that it would force me to try to learn them in ADEPT.
2066800	2071160	And I was like, oh, I'm bored, let's just play Nurse, which is I think on my VOD of
2071160	2072840	me saying that.
2072840	2079840	Well, either I had infants or I had meme people, although all but one of them were
2079840	2081520	in Nash levels.
2081520	2087880	I got my first 5K as Nurse and ADEPTed.
2087880	2088880	Wow, congrats.
2088880	2089880	Hey, nice.
2089880	2090880	Good way to do it.
2090880	2091880	I'll take it.
2091880	2092880	I'll take it.
2092880	2093880	Yeah, nice.
2093880	2096240	That means I never have to try this shit on Sally again.
2096240	2098440	And I also got ADEPT tag.
2098440	2099440	Oh, wow.
2099440	2100440	Congrats.
2100440	2103080	ADEPT tag is actually easier than I thought it would be.
2103080	2106640	Her perks are pretty strong compared to the base kit for others.
2106640	2108880	I'm not looking forward to ADEPTing Plague.
2108880	2109880	Yeah, yeah.
2109880	2110880	Oh, congrats.
2110880	2113400	Honestly, I don't like Pig's perks.
2113400	2114400	I like playing her.
2114400	2115400	I hate her perks.
2115400	2116400	All right.
2116400	2118400	But yeah, but that's it.
2118400	2119400	All right.
2119400	2123600	That's a little diversite in your gaming week there with pinball and cyberpunks.
2123600	2124600	Cool.
2124600	2125600	Cool.
2125600	2127160	And of course I played Fantasian.
2127160	2128160	Oh, right.
2128160	2129160	Right.
2129160	2130160	Right.
2130160	2134360	Ricky, how was your gaming week?
2134360	2136280	I think you're muted or I'm not hearing you.
2136280	2137280	Oh, there we go.
2137280	2138280	So sorry about that.
2138280	2140620	Couldn't remember if I was muted or not.
2140620	2143800	So this week I've been playing Minecraft.
2143800	2147240	I know it's a shock.
2147240	2153980	I've been very busy on the server and doing server admin stuff, mainly server admin stuff
2153980	2157080	lately because I'm running the server.
2157080	2165080	So today we finally got our server converted over the paper MC, which made it much better.
2165080	2170560	We've been having like lag issues, like all sorts of crazy like issues from like literally
2170560	2175680	nothing that should be causing like we have very few players on where have all the optimizations
2175680	2178640	we could possibly put on the server in there.
2178640	2186000	And it was just not doing the thing like it's ridiculous.
2186000	2192520	So switching the paper just magically made everything work just fine, which is fantastic.
2192520	2197560	And that's how kind of we ran the server last season with Collision MC and stuff like that
2197560	2200360	and how they're doing it this year.
2200360	2203620	So I just said bite the bullet and take, you know, put that in there.
2203620	2208160	I don't know why we were on Fabric in the beginning in the first place, I think is because
2208160	2214860	somebody wanted to run their personally developed mod packs in there.
2214860	2217440	And now that player isn't playing on the server.
2217440	2222660	So he made a bunch of recommendations that we followed and they were bad recommendations.
2222660	2228220	So once they started ignoring the recommendations, then everything started working.
2228220	2231200	So yeah, we finally got that done.
2231200	2235800	And I did a big build for like a harbor and stuff.
2235800	2240900	I think last week I put out an episode and I should be doing a new one here pretty soon.
2240900	2242940	So it's been a lot of fun.
2242940	2243940	Nice.
2244500	2245500	All right.
2245500	2248020	Anything else amongst your E.R. adventures and all that?
2248020	2249020	Just mostly Minecraft?
2249020	2253080	No, just to explain the DuckTales in the background.
2253080	2259620	So that is because I convinced my youngest son to watch DuckTales and now he's hooked.
2259620	2260620	He's hooked on the new series.
2260620	2261620	Oh, how funny.
2261620	2266940	But now he watched, he binge watched all three seasons of the new series all this week.
2266940	2271440	And then he started the old series now.
2271440	2273140	So I just thought that was funny.
2273140	2274140	Oh, cool.
2274140	2277680	You got to make him play the game that DuckTales remastered was pretty good.
2277680	2280940	I know that I do need the I need to buy that for him.
2280940	2281940	Yeah.
2281940	2282940	He wants it.
2282940	2284020	Didn't it get delisted for a hot minute?
2284020	2285020	I think it might be back.
2285020	2286020	I think it like came back.
2286020	2290060	I don't have it like it's probably like a Disney Afternoon pack or something like that.
2290060	2293940	Don't they have like there was a Disney thing, but that was a different set of games.
2293940	2298140	That was like the Rescue Rangers and those those games that they put in that pack.
2298140	2300940	It might have had DuckTales 2 in there.
2300940	2301940	But yeah.
2301940	2302940	All right.
2302940	2303940	I'll take it.
2303940	2305580	Dartasuya in chat says it did.
2305580	2306580	Yeah.
2306580	2307580	But I think it came back.
2307580	2308580	I don't know.
2308580	2309580	Anyway, I don't think I ever shouted out the chat room.
2309580	2310580	Hi, chat.
2310580	2311580	Sorry, guys.
2311580	2312580	We had a lot to catch up on.
2312580	2314940	Who and I noticed SJ100Matt says gaming week.
2314940	2317340	A lot of things at MAGFest, mostly pinball.
2317340	2318340	Yeah.
2318340	2319340	MAGFest was this weekend.
2319340	2323700	And boy, I bet it was I bet it was a little strange with everything going on in the world.
2323700	2325540	But Dragon Con was weird, too.
2325540	2328020	I was very happy to see all the pictures and things I'm seeing.
2328020	2329700	Everybody's taking precautions.
2329700	2331660	So good for y'all.
2331660	2332660	Let's see.
2332660	2334880	Oh, Bobby does confirm it came back seven months later.
2334880	2335880	That's good.
2335880	2339460	Bobby Blackwolf also bringing up the Rush pinball table, which he went into great detail
2339460	2340540	about on his show.
2340540	2342880	And I know like Rush is like his favorite band.
2342880	2345840	So I am not surprised at all to hear that he went all in on that table.
2345840	2349540	But Darsakha, I know you're kind of the pinball queen here at OLR.
2349540	2352700	Did you see on that Rush pinball table or and are you like, oh, that looks good?
2352700	2356860	Or you just kind of like, no more space?
2356860	2357860	You're muted.
2357860	2361460	Y'all check your mutes.
2361460	2368980	I would, in a heartbeat, get rid of ACDC and Guns N' Roses for Rush.
2368980	2370420	OK.
2370420	2374700	And Dan just might come home to find them gone.
2374700	2377780	That Guns N' Roses table is pretty nice, though, even if it is old axle.
2377780	2378780	It's not.
2378780	2379780	No, no, no.
2379780	2380780	I don't have the old Guns N' Roses.
2380780	2382220	No, I was going to see Jack Guns N' Roses.
2382220	2383220	No, I know.
2383220	2386020	I was going to say a lot of people might be thinking of that older table and it isn't
2386020	2387560	it is the I used to have one.
2387560	2390420	But with with old axle, that's my point.
2390420	2393480	It's the thing you see in the video is dad bought axle.
2393480	2394480	Yeah.
2394480	2398000	No, I the Jersey Jack Guns N' Roses is pretty fun.
2398000	2403480	I mean, I really am a big fan of the Jersey Jack tables.
2403480	2405840	But man.
2405840	2412520	Like I would play like the ACDC table, I play a couple of songs on that one just because
2412520	2413520	they're the ones I like.
2413960	2415040	Aerosmith table.
2415040	2420080	I played like nothing but sweet emotion on that one.
2420080	2423720	I'll play this, you know, some of the different Guns N' Roses one, because I mean, I was in
2423720	2428360	middle school when at the height of Guns N' Roses, you know, an appetite for destruction
2428360	2429360	came out.
2429360	2430720	It's I just was it's interesting.
2430720	2435560	You named those two tables is one you're willing to sacrifice, but not Megadeth.
2435560	2436760	I don't have Megadeth.
2436760	2437760	I thought you did.
2437760	2438760	What was the other machine I'm thinking of?
2438760	2439880	Do we have Megadeth?
2439880	2442640	I think you do not even know.
2442640	2443640	I don't know.
2443640	2447240	Go out in your garage and look, I'm pretty sure there was a Megadeth out there.
2447240	2448880	Well if we had Megadeth that shit can go.
2448880	2451040	Because they only did two good songs.
2451040	2456960	I can't believe she doesn't even fucking know what machine she has.
2456960	2459160	They rotated it out so fast.
2459160	2460160	I love it.
2460160	2461600	No, we might be borrowing that one.
2461600	2462600	Oh, I think you know what?
2462600	2464160	And I think Dan was saying something about that.
2464160	2466760	I don't think I think it is you guys are housing it.
2466760	2470200	Now I have sweating bullets stuck in my head.
2470200	2472020	Where's my ABBA pinball table?
2472900	2477220	That's my, that's my, so, so Bob, Bobby was talking about like, you know, you have your
2477220	2480500	like whatever it is, Holy grail pinball table and like the one thing that's going to make
2480500	2483300	you go, well, I guess I'm buying a pinball table.
2483300	2485060	And for him, it was rush for me.
2485060	2486060	It's ABBA.
2486060	2489740	So let's, let's all Mandalorian, but I like that one.
2489740	2490740	Yeah.
2490740	2491740	All right.
2491740	2492740	Anyway.
2492740	2497620	Well, the thing is I have to see who did the, um, the design behind this one.
2497620	2499740	Is it a Steve Ritchie?
2499780	2502260	Uh, this new rush table.
2502260	2503260	Yeah.
2503260	2508860	No, Bobby said it on his show and it was somebody who did, um, other tables.
2508860	2510860	He went into some of the, uh, John Borg.
2510860	2511860	That was it.
2511860	2512860	Oh, okay.
2512860	2513860	Cool.
2513860	2514860	Cool.
2514860	2515860	Cool.
2515860	2516860	Cool.
2516860	2517860	Cool.
2517860	2518860	Yeah.
2518860	2519860	Um, honestly, the only thing that would make this table even better is if it was a Papa
2519860	2520860	Duke design.
2520860	2521860	Hmm.
2521860	2522860	All right.
2522860	2525460	Then again, Papa Duke did theater and world cup and Arabian nights.
2525460	2528220	Oh, those are, yeah, those are classics.
2528220	2530060	Those are like three of my favorite tables right there.
2530060	2531060	All right.
2531060	2532060	Yeah.
2532060	2533060	Let me get into my given week.
2533060	2536020	Um, because I actually played a little more than final fantasy 14 this week and dead by
2536020	2537020	daylight.
2537020	2538020	I played some other stuff as well.
2538020	2541020	Um, and a lot of that was thanks to trying to be good about streaming every day this
2541020	2542020	week.
2542020	2544540	So I played, um, final fantasy for pixel remaster.
2544540	2548020	Um, and I, I decided to just grab that.
2548020	2551100	I was going to say on the steam sale, but I don't think it was actually on steam sale.
2551100	2552300	I just grabbed it.
2552300	2555700	Um, because you know what, if I'm going to double dip on any final fantasy, I'm going
2555700	2557020	to do it with four.
2557020	2560700	Um, and I say double dip because I'm still holding out hope that they're just going to
2560700	2563460	put out the pixel remasters again on console.
2563460	2565420	Um, I really hope they do.
2565420	2566660	They've got to change the font.
2566660	2570180	If they do it, the font doesn't annoy me as much as I thought it would, but the more I
2570180	2574500	thought about it, the more I realized, well, if you're playing on a tablet or phone, that's
2574500	2575940	right in front of your face.
2575940	2579500	And if you're playing on a computer screen on steam, that's right in front of your face.
2579500	2583180	And so the font isn't annoying, but on a television, that's going to be very annoying.
2583180	2585900	They might be able to get away with it on switch because you can play a switch in handheld
2585900	2586900	mode.
2586900	2590820	Um, I'm hoping there's going to be some sort of pixel remaster deluxe that allows you
2590820	2593660	to change the fonts and maybe has some other extras in it.
2593660	2596980	Cause the, the, um, extras that come with pixel remaster are pretty light.
2596980	2602300	You get a variety of artwork and like a jukebox, very standard stuff, uh, for a game.
2602300	2606360	Um, maybe you can get the bonus dungeon back in there from the Game Boy advanced version
2606360	2607360	or something.
2607360	2608360	That would be really cool.
2608360	2615780	Um, so, um, uh, yeah, um, I was enjoying my time with it.
2615780	2619100	The thing that surprised me is that the translation is new.
2619100	2621460	I was like, is this the DS translation?
2621460	2623020	I just don't remember it very well.
2623020	2626820	Um, but I did some research on Reddit and it turns out they actually did a new translation
2626820	2630060	for, um, Final Fantasy three remaster and four remaster.
2630060	2633100	For whatever reason, they did not recycle the DS ones.
2633100	2635380	I don't know if that was a space concern or what.
2635380	2641660	So they actually did do new, uh, um, translations and it, it really does change things of the
2641660	2646600	story that you might remember from Final Fantasy two growing up with that as a kid.
2646600	2651400	Because of course, and I think we all know this now, those games were not great translations
2651400	2656840	because they had to cut many corners to get that game to fit.
2656840	2661320	And they did things and took shortcuts that I don't think Square would do today in retrospect
2661320	2664220	and how big the Final Fantasy franchise got here after all.
2664220	2668920	Um, so it is nice to play those games in more of a context, uh, they were meant to be played.
2668920	2672920	So, um, yeah, I'm enjoying the pixel remaster outside of the font.
2672920	2675820	Uh, and I even got the scene for you, Spoony Bard.
2675820	2679080	I'm happy to report it is still intact in that whole scene.
2679080	2680080	People would riot in the streets.
2680080	2685500	Yeah, people, they have to keep that the same, even if you do a new translation, um, also
2685500	2686660	a new to me game.
2686660	2690560	I played a game called Death's Door, which came out in the last year and is an indie
2690560	2691560	favorite.
2691560	2692560	A lot of people were really enjoying.
2692560	2694040	I took requests on Twitter.
2694040	2696240	I was like, Hey, what game should I stream?
2696240	2697640	Steam sales going on right now.
2697640	2698640	Convince me.
2698680	2700480	And, uh, Mike Deff said, get this game.
2700480	2701920	And so I was like, all right, I will.
2701920	2702920	Uh, and it's cute.
2702920	2703920	I'm glad I picked it up.
2703920	2710000	It's um, I want to say it's kind of like Zelda-y, but kind of like with, um, I don't want to
2710000	2711520	say a roguelike element to it.
2711520	2715080	It feels like it, even though the game actually isn't roguelike and nothing is like randomized
2715080	2716080	in that regard.
2716080	2719640	Kind of has that sort of feel to it, uh, kind of like puzzle-y type of thing.
2719640	2724760	Um, and, uh, it's a, it's a very unique art style, uh, which I think kind of draws a lot
2724760	2725840	of people in as well.
2725840	2727120	So I've been enjoying my time with that.
2727120	2731360	It's kind of, it's one of those, like, you have to repeat something three or four times
2731360	2733960	until you're like, Oh, that's the pattern.
2733960	2735160	And then you like get it.
2735160	2738480	So, uh, it's definitely one of those types of games, uh, learning it.
2738480	2739480	So I had a good time with that.
2739480	2742640	Um, so I'll probably stream that again for another day next week.
2742640	2747440	Uh, and then I played a little bit of No Man's Sky, went back to an old favorite because
2747440	2752880	Expedition 4 started this last week and, uh, I started the expedition on stream.
2752880	2758400	Um, I only played a little bit off stream and what I meant to do off stream was not
2758400	2759680	what I finished off stream.
2759680	2763680	And I'll talk a little bit about that, uh, tomorrow, Monday, when I stream No Man's Sky
2763680	2765320	again after work.
2765320	2768580	I'm very excited to get back in on that and I'll tell you about the interesting stuff
2768580	2769740	that's happened.
2769740	2777160	Long story short, um, user bases are really allowing people to cheese some of the mechanics.
2777160	2782620	And Alan, who also streams No Man's Sky sometimes, he has already done with the expedition.
2782620	2784100	He didn't stream any of it.
2784100	2785780	He finished it in like four hours.
2785780	2790640	He said that was the fastest one of all four, um, because A, he knew what he was doing better
2790640	2793580	than any of the three times that he'd done it before.
2793580	2796480	And B, the user bases made it simple.
2796480	2799160	There was a user base called Get Eggs Here.
2799160	2802860	There was a user base called, uh, Six Bones Here.
2802860	2806580	And like the user bases that people are making are just telling people like, hey, come here
2806580	2808060	for the easy grind stuff.
2808060	2811580	Um, which is, and even if you're not in multiplayer mode, you can still see the bases that other
2811580	2812820	people make.
2812820	2816280	And for those of you that think that's a cheesy way to do it, hey, it's your choice to go
2816280	2818740	or not go to the user made bases.
2818740	2820260	So there is that.
2820260	2825860	Uh, Mike Defton Chat talking about Death's Door saying, it's Zelda in terms of exploration
2825860	2827420	and puzzles.
2827420	2829420	Combat is fail and learn.
2829420	2832500	Quest Buster says, I got my wormy head in No Man's Sky.
2832500	2835380	It took me around seven or eight hours blind to finish the expedition.
2835380	2837660	I used one of those bases for the eggs.
2837660	2840480	I guess I'll go ahead and say here, me too.
2840480	2842300	That is the thing I got finished off stream.
2842300	2848120	I wasn't expecting to because somebody made a base called Egg Farm and I was like, how
2848120	2850720	do you farm those eggs?
2850720	2854780	And uh, for those that don't know the game so well, there are these alien eggs and usually
2854780	2858180	when you, when you farm them by attacking them, you have to pick them up right away
2858180	2863800	or they'll disintegrate and then a swarm of really nasty aliens comes out to attack you.
2863800	2867080	It's like immediately going to like a four star rating in Grand Theft Auto.
2867080	2868080	It's really nasty.
2868080	2873280	Well, what somebody did at this base, they found one of those outlets and they built
2873280	2878840	a wall around the entire base and put the eggs inside that wall.
2878840	2884200	So it's like two walls basically like, like Tron like bikes in tandem going around the
2884200	2885200	base.
2885200	2890720	Um, and what they did is that, so when you pick up the eggs, the things spawn, they don't,
2890720	2893560	they figured out this cause they never spawn on top of you.
2893560	2897560	They always spawn a little ways away and they, they're too stupid to get through walls.
2897560	2900840	So you pick up the eggs, the aliens can't get through the walls.
2900840	2903760	In about a minute they dissipate and you go back to your ship.
2903760	2904760	Easy peasy.
2904760	2907920	So that was, that was very much the sound of that.
2907920	2908920	Yeah.
2908920	2909920	Right.
2909920	2911760	So it's make it, making the grinds pretty easy.
2911760	2914200	So we'll finish that on my Twitch tomorrow.
2914200	2920760	Uh, I actually logged, I stopped my game off stream at that base so I could show it tomorrow
2920760	2921760	on stream.
2921760	2925160	So if you want the coordinates for whatever reason and all that, uh, it is in that same
2925160	2926160	galaxy.
2926160	2927880	Um, what was I calling that one?
2927880	2931920	It had the planet called like Bonesville that had all the, somebody named the planet with
2931920	2934360	all the ancient bones, Bonesville.
2934360	2938400	So he knew where to go and it was on another planet in that same galaxy, which I think
2938400	2942120	I was calling like, uh, what the, what was it?
2942120	2944120	Like shucks or something like that.
2944120	2945120	I don't know.
2945120	2946120	S S S C something.
2946120	2951960	So, um, yeah, so we'll play that, uh, again tomorrow on my Twitch over at Rob Roberts.
2951960	2952960	Okay.
2952960	2955280	Um, we have some gaming news to talk about.
2955320	2958520	There's been a few things that have happened this week among CES and other stuff.
2958520	2962240	Now that we're getting back into the routine and I hope all of you that went back to work
2962240	2963960	this week had a great time.
2963960	2968360	Well, I mean, I know work isn't always a great time, but I hope you hope you had a good restful
2968360	2971440	holiday that made getting through this week easy.
2971440	2974360	And now, uh, some of the video game companies are getting back to work.
2974360	2978480	So we are getting a little more news and we're going to start with Loki's headline.
2978480	2979480	Yeah.
2979640	2989320	So, um, Jeff Ross, who was, um, at one time, I think with a sucker punch productions, um,
2989320	2992520	or I'm sorry, uh, Ben's studio.
2992520	2998760	So Jeff Ross, they, they were the ones that did like days gone and resistance.
2998760	3007600	And, um, so apparently days gone, didn't perform as well as Sony had wanted it to.
3007600	3016640	So they sold, I guess, over 8 million copies, but because, um, it wasn't enough that they
3016640	3020840	basically canned a sequel to the game.
3020840	3026320	And I don't understand how they can be disappointed with like over 8 million copies being sold
3026320	3028720	and it's still more to this day.
3028720	3037160	Um, maybe cause of the review scores, it wasn't as, you know, well-reviewed, um, but with
3037200	3043040	that though, there's, you know, they're still pitching other ideas.
3043040	3049840	So the studio is looking to maybe even go back to, um, an open world resistance game,
3049840	3051880	which I am all for.
3051880	3052880	I love to resist.
3052880	3055520	Yeah, that is a great series.
3055520	3065560	It was like, um, it was like, it was actually, it was funny cause it reminded me of, oh wow.
3065560	3068280	That was, oh, okay.
3068280	3069280	So, okay.
3069280	3072600	And then my internet just went, uh, took a big hit there.
3072600	3077160	So as we're broadcasting live, there must've been a huge hiccup on Comcast and because
3077160	3082840	Loki dropped and my thing just went to a red box and then immediately came back.
3082840	3085780	So we probably lost a few frames on Twitch.
3085780	3089400	The podcast will sound normal cause it comes from a localized recording, but I just have
3089400	3092800	to buy a little more time while Loki reconnects here.
3092800	3095300	That was a very strange, connected.
3095300	3096300	You are here.
3096300	3097300	Yeah.
3097300	3098300	We just don't see you yet, but we hear you.
3098300	3099300	That's good enough.
3099300	3101980	Um, so you were talking about, uh, the resistance open world.
3101980	3102980	Yeah.
3102980	3104620	So, um, yeah, I'm all for that.
3104620	3107620	You know, the resistance was such a really fun game.
3107620	3111620	The first one, at least I'm second, I don't remember if I liked it as much, but the first
3111620	3112980	one I really enjoyed.
3112980	3118260	Um, this is coming back from like when I kind of liked it, you know, call of duty two and,
3118260	3122780	um, even like, uh, like the original modern warfare games and stuff like that were pretty
3122780	3125260	fun, but like, it was just a really fun kind of mix.
3125260	3130980	So like a world war two shooter with like this alien halo, almost elements to it.
3130980	3131980	And I really enjoyed it.
3131980	3136060	So yeah, I would love for them to bring that back.
3136060	3137900	It's more so, you know, than days gone.
3137900	3142300	I never played days gone and yeah, the zombies are kind of overdone.
3142300	3146560	You know, I can't be helped, but reminded of that story about how tomb Raider apparently
3146560	3149380	undersold and everybody was sitting here going what?
3149380	3153440	But I mean, that was evil cause like tomb Raider, I still feel like probably that game
3153440	3157840	did better than days gone, but I still feel like a lot of people grab days gone.
3157840	3162700	Do you think maybe Sony shot it in the foot by giving it away too early on like PlayStation
3162700	3164480	plus and that sort of thing?
3164480	3166040	I don't think they even shot it in the foot.
3166040	3170760	Like if they're saying they sold 8 million copies of it, like true, like how many copies
3170760	3172320	of this game did you want to sell?
3172320	3173880	Like, I don't know.
3173880	3176520	And then it's on a PC now.
3176520	3183400	Um, so I mean, yeah, who knows how much sold like 8 million copies.
3183400	3189000	And they're saying, you know, that's a huge success, but like, I don't know, 8 million
3189000	3190520	copies in less than two years.
3190520	3193520	Like it could be about the budgets.
3193520	3195240	I don't know.
3195240	3200540	Maybe I don't know what the budget of the game was, but like, I mean, geez, like what
3200540	3203320	are your expectations?
3203320	3205440	Make those a little bit more realistic, please.
3205440	3206440	I know.
3206440	3207440	All right.
3207440	3211080	This game that you're developing has got to sell a hundred million copies to 10 million
3211080	3212080	people.
3212640	3213640	Yeah.
3213640	3218000	Um, I'm going to apologize to the live folks because I see that we are kind of going up
3218000	3222000	and down with the frames and I don't know what's causing it.
3222000	3224600	There's no inclement weather or anything going on.
3224600	3230560	So this is just some weird and plus, Loki, you, you lost your internet hiccup too, right?
3230560	3234000	So this must be some wider like west coast issue.
3234000	3236240	I'm still like connected with everything.
3236240	3239600	So like it just, my camera like blinked and I was about it.
3239600	3240600	So I don't know.
3240600	3241600	Something weird is going on you guys.
3242120	3243120	I'm very sorry.
3243120	3244480	We're going to push through for the sake of the podcast folks.
3244480	3247120	Um, but thank you for sticking with us here live on Twitch.
3247120	3250720	I don't think I said this yet, but we do tape live of course, every Sunday night at nine
3250720	3255160	o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG network,
3255160	3259680	twitch.tv slash a V O G network, the voice of geeks network and where we've been for
3259680	3262080	now our 10th year at VOG network.
3262080	3266040	I mean, technically the birthday's in like April, but, um, you know, we're celebrating
3266040	3267680	20 years a little early at OLR.
3267680	3269840	So why not celebrate 10 a little early at VOG?
3270080	3273160	So one of the things I liked about resistance for some of the weapons that they had in there,
3273160	3278920	they had, this was like even before like Titanfall had this where you had bullets basically that
3278920	3283200	you could tag like an enemy with, and then you can shoot them and they go around walls
3283200	3286480	and stuff and they'd follow kind of home in on it, which is pretty awesome.
3286480	3291880	Plus it had a really cool campaign where you unlock a bunch of weapons throughout the campaign
3291880	3296800	and then you play like almost like a new game plus, and then there's brand new weapons you
3296800	3298640	unlock as well.
3298640	3300640	So that's pretty awesome.
3300640	3301640	That's pretty cool.
3301640	3302640	All right.
3302640	3305520	Um, yeah, we just dropped down to zero.
3305520	3308160	Like we're not actually putting anything out on Twitch right now, but you guys are still
3308160	3309160	here.
3309160	3311480	So I know the internet was flickering for me.
3311480	3312480	Was it interesting?
3312480	3318160	Cause I was like, I know it's not the internet because, um, uh, you guys are still here.
3318160	3319160	So it's weird.
3319160	3320160	All right.
3320160	3322600	I'm going to try to push through and talk about this next story.
3322600	3325280	Um, and just hope the internet kind of recovers there.
3325920	3331160	If I have to, I'll stop the show and fire up, um, a different Twitch server to see if
3331160	3332440	it's on Twitch's end.
3332440	3334080	But for now, let me get into this next story.
3334080	3338480	So, um, of course, consumer electronics show happened this week and arcade one up showed
3338480	3344200	up and arcade one up was showing off some new cabinets, including a brand new pack mania
3344200	3345200	cabinet.
3345200	3348480	Um, I think pack mania has been in before.
3348480	3354040	This pack mania cabinet though, it's actually a little bit of like a best of Namco collection.
3354040	3359840	When I tell you what's in this cabinet, it's Dig Dug, Dig Dug 2, Galaga, Galaga ADA, Galaxian
3359840	3364560	Mappy, pack and pal, pack land, pack man, pack man plus, pack mania, rolling thunder,
3364560	3366620	rompers and super pack man.
3366620	3370200	So what's interesting about these arcade one up machines and for a lot of people that have
3370200	3374640	been bitching this whole time, well, they only put like four games in those machines
3374640	3376280	and that sort of thing.
3376280	3382720	Um, I feel like this is sort of like, oh, well now that they've kind of put out all
3382720	3386520	those games, now they're starting to do more of these super machines.
3386520	3390280	So again, this really feels like a, like a super Namco collection.
3390280	3393200	So dark soccer, how do you feel hearing about that?
3393200	3394200	Cool.
3394200	3395200	Yeah.
3395200	3398280	You, are you, are you kind of interested in it?
3398280	3399280	I'm sorry.
3399280	3401600	Are you, are you kind of interested in that machine?
3401600	3402600	Kinda.
3402600	3403600	Yeah.
3403600	3404600	I don't blame you.
3404600	3405600	I'm sorry.
3405600	3406600	You're breaking up really badly.
3406600	3407600	Okay.
3407600	3408600	Then that's so weird.
3408600	3409600	Did you see the other ones too?
3409600	3414520	The other, uh, the Midway and uh, Midway and the Azhar Academy.
3414520	3415520	Oh yeah.
3415520	3416520	Yeah, no, I was going to get, I was going to get there.
3416520	3420160	There's a mortal combat one as well, which is just a Midway collection.
3420160	3422160	I want this machine to be honest.
3422160	3424800	I want the Tron one more, but I really liked this one.
3424800	3430680	This one has bubbles, defender, gauntlet, joust, klax, mortal combat one, two and three,
3430680	3435620	paper boy, rampage, tapper, tuben, ultimate mortal combat three and wizard of war.
3435620	3437400	That's a really solid collection.
3437400	3442520	And then there's a centipede cabinet, which is basically an Atari collection with a car
3442520	3449440	asteroids, asteroids, deluxe, centipede, crystal castles, gravatar, a liberator, lunar lander,
3449440	3454800	major havoc, millipede, missile command, space dual, super breakout and tempest.
3454800	3461720	Now on top of all this, we have the very first pro machine that is coming out.
3461720	3464520	This pro machine is a killer instinct cabinet.
3464520	3470880	It is a clone of the first killer instinct cabinet, but it is a 19 inch screen and it
3470880	3475900	has, it's basically the size of an actual arcade cabinet.
3475900	3479000	You know how arcade one up machines, they're kind of a little bit smaller, even though
3479000	3482240	you still play them standing up and they kind of, they kind of feel right.
3482240	3486960	They still, they, but this is going to be the actual size of a real cabinet.
3486960	3490680	And for that reason, you can expect it's probably going to be closer to a thousand dollars,
3490680	3493440	but still a pretty nice machine there.
3493440	3496960	And I'm sure Dark Sakura is probably going to be interested in that.
3496960	3497960	So all right.
3497960	3498960	Yeah.
3498960	3500000	I love that game.
3500000	3501640	The internet issues are continuing.
3501640	3505400	So before we get to Dark Sakura's next story, we're going to do a little bit of a break
3505400	3506400	here.
3506400	3509680	I'm going to do the whole, turn it off and on again, just to make sure it's not my internet
3509680	3511040	and we'll be right back.
3511040	3512880	Please stay with us, folks.
3512880	3519440	We'll be right back here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
3519440	3521800	And unfortunately that ended up being the end of the show.
3521800	3525880	I had some pretty major issues with my upload speed that took a few days for the cable company
3525880	3526880	to fix.
3526880	3530440	Sucks when things out of your control happen, but what can you do?
3530440	3533760	Appreciate those of you that turned up live and those that listened to the podcast this
3533760	3534760	week.
3534760	3538200	Sorry it's a late post, but the hobbled upload meant I couldn't even move the recording to
3538200	3543280	Dropbox and sorry about the abrupt ending, but it is what it is and we'll try again next
3543280	3544280	week.
3544280	3546280	Until then, take care everyone.
