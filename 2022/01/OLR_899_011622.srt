00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,020
This week, I updated my Steam profile's featured screenshots to include a grab from

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,880
Electronic Superjoy that had a character saying, what's Zynga's favorite TV show?

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,880
Game of Clones!

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,960
Today, I see that Zynga is being acquired by Take-Two.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,720
I hope the copycat Bonanza and acquisition of Sega's famed San Francisco headquarters

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,100
created a lot of value for shareholders.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,160
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,800
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Hello, my friends.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:47,600
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,680
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back, and I hope we are back for a nice, long show

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,860
tonight with episode number 899.

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:03,980
For this January the 16th of 2022, our first, hopefully, real show of the year.

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,140
No medical issues, no internet issues, knock on wood, no weather issues, knock on wood,

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,140
knock on everything.

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,360
I am here, Rob Roberts, joining you with my co-host.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,940
Say hello, as always, to the wonderful Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

19
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,940
Hi.

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,500
Hi, Jamie Summers.

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,260
And Jamie, please join me in giving props to our voiceover dude, VX Jason XV, because

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,380
he did an A-plus job tonight, I'm just saying.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,380
He does great work.

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,380
He did.

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,380
He does.

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,380
He does.

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,380
How are you doing?

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,380
I'm all right.

29
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,380
Yeah?

30
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,380
All right.

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,380
A little sinacy.

32
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,380
Yeah, I can hear you a little sniffly.

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,160
It's not the big C, though, right?

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
I don't know.

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Probably not.

36
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
All right.

37
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,180
I mean, I just started feeling a little bit crappy a couple days ago, but it's okay.

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,180
Okay.

39
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,140
I'm supposed to go back to work on the 19th, but we'll see.

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,140
All right.

41
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,780
Well, I hope everything gets back to normal for you.

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,780
Hey, the 19th.

43
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,300
That's a big day for me.

44
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
Oh, no, no.

45
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,900
No, no, yeah, this is the 19th.

46
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,220
Sorry, my days are all mixed up.

47
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,220
It is our anniversary of the 19th.

48
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,220
Yes.

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,220
In my head, I was like, the 17th.

50
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,220
No, wait, wait, no, the 19th.

51
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,220
All right.

52
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,220
Wednesday.

53
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,220
Yes.

54
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,220
The internet might work.

55
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,220
My brain may not.

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,220
Also, say hello.

57
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,220
Oh, Rob.

58
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,260
Oh, me.

59
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,980
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

60
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,980
Hello.

61
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,780
Hi, Loki.

62
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,260
I see you broadcasting a game play behind you because we do tape live every Sunday night

63
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,460
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

64
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:40,140
VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 9 Eastern, 6 Pacific.

65
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,660
And I see as we are broadcasting live here, you're playing some Mario Paint behind you.

66
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,660
Yeah.

67
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,100
Like earlier this week, I had like a game that came up and I was like, oh, yeah, I got

68
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,040
to do that for my background video.

69
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,100
And then today immediately forgot what that was.

70
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,100
So that's Mario Paint.

71
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,560
I'm like, oh, that would be perfect.

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,020
That would totally fit in with everything that we're talking about.

73
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,980
And then it's Mario Paint.

74
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,980
It is.

75
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,220
I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

76
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,920
SSU 100 Matt points out maybe part of my confusion, like the 17th being an important day.

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,960
That is what would have been Betty White's 100th birthday.

78
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,880
And SSU 100 Matt is reminding us the internet is calling for folks to donate to an animal

79
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,640
charity in her name tomorrow.

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Love that idea.

81
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Love it.

82
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:33,480
So I'm considering going to my PetSmart tomorrow and buying some bags of cat food for the kitties

83
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
that they house.

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
Oh, OK.

85
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Nice.

86
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
We'll see.

87
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
Nice.

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Nice.

89
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
All right.

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,840
Well, he's going there and harassing the cats.

91
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,820
Before we get into our kickoff topic tonight, I do want to address last week's show.

92
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,100
There's no nice way to say it.

93
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,460
It was a disaster.

94
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,600
It was just one of those things.

95
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,460
It was it was an awful week.

96
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,780
And you know, you do 900 shows as of next week.

97
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,620
There's going to be a few stinkers in there.

98
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,960
And it just sucks that a lot of it was out of our control.

99
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,520
And you know, it is what it is.

100
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,640
I apologize to the podcast folks because I didn't get the podcast up till really late

101
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
in the week.

102
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,140
My upload was still borked for several days after the show.

103
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,060
And that's what that's what was wrong is that my upload speed was, for whatever reason,

104
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,060
not working right.

105
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,260
I was getting like half a megabyte upload, which to get video out on Twitch, you need

106
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,100
like four K, five K, even like low video.

107
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,300
You need like two K. And I wasn't even getting that for upload.

108
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,460
So it really kind of hosed the show.

109
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,340
And then Dark Sakura was having webcam problems.

110
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,120
But honestly, those problems didn't really end up mattering because, uh oh, I think I

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,280
jinxed it because now she's got to plug it in.

112
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
I okay.

113
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,640
I didn't have to plug in anything.

114
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,160
I was adjusting it and turned on my lock screen.

115
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Oh, okay.

116
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
All right.

117
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Because I use my iPhone as my webcam.

118
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,280
I was like, oh, no, not again.

119
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Yeah.

120
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,560
And I appreciate you guys in chat.

121
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,960
Dark Tetsuya says not your fault.

122
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,480
Pod Culture says not your fault.

123
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Shit happens.

124
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
I know.

125
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
I know.

126
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,160
Continuing the theme tonight, because Bobby Black Wolf was beating up on himself earlier

127
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,060
for things during awesome games done quick, which there's no need to be awesome games

128
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,300
done quick was awesome games done quickly.

129
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,700
And they raised a lot of money, which we'll talk about later in the show, of course.

130
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,100
But now I beat myself up over issues that were out of my control and is what it is.

131
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,820
So finally they and of course, you know, I I filed a ticket and they wanted to send a

132
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,080
tech out here, but they didn't need to because somebody else figured out the problem.

133
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,160
So I had to cancel the tech because the problem just magically fixed itself on like Wednesday

134
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,400
or Thursday.

135
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,880
So anyway, I did run a bandwidth test before the show tonight.

136
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,640
We were able to maintain for 10 minutes.

137
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,120
So I'm hoping all is well.

138
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
It is what it is.

139
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,680
We're just going to push through and talk about video games.

140
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
All right.

141
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Tested mine to make sure it's good.

142
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Yes.

143
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
We're all testing.

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,740
So my upload is about 40 megabits.

145
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,280
So I'm happy.

146
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,680
Welcome to our real first show of 2022.

147
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,440
And Loki, you're feeling good, right?

148
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,840
Hopefully I'm fine.

149
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Good.

150
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,860
Welcome to our first show of 2022.

151
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,320
Let's get into, of course, talking about what better thing to talk about for our first show

152
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,920
for 2022 than to go back and talk about 2021.

153
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,300
But I received a tweet this week that was like, hey, Rob, you guys going to talk about

154
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
your games of the year?

155
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,420
And I was like, oh, yeah, that was a that's a thing we should probably talk about around

156
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,420
this time.

157
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,960
So I want to open the floor and talk about what were your favorite, what was your favorite

158
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,840
game or your favorite games?

159
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,780
I'm not going to be very formal about it.

160
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,460
And I'll get into why when I get into my game.

161
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:46,400
But I just want to ask you, like, what were your like game or games of the year for 2021?

162
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,980
My game didn't come out last year.

163
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,120
And that's OK.

164
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,680
And I think this is a very important rule to set is that it's it's the game for you.

165
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,380
And no, but nobody can say that's right or wrong.

166
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,680
People can argue about critic lists all they want and like the definitive top hundred of

167
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,080
all time because everybody's list is going to be different.

168
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,980
So it's really like, what was it for you?

169
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,440
So Dark Soccer, since you kind of started there and you're saying it's not something

170
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,400
from this year, what is your game of the year or games?

171
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,560
I am going to say it's Dead by Daylight just because I played the most of it and I've had

172
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,140
the most fun playing it and I've met the best people playing it.

173
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:30,660
So the game overall has been.

174
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:38,320
Great for me, even though it makes me curse like a freaking sailor, you know, but I've

175
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:47,660
had a great time playing it and the game itself is different than, you know, the.

176
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,500
The original release of it, obviously, I mean, they've made some changes and there's graphic

177
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,660
updates and even the mechanics in the game are different than they were, you know, on

178
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,540
its original release.

179
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,960
So yeah, I'm going to say say that and Fantasian.

180
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,460
See I was I thought you'd say Fantasian.

181
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,500
I mean, no one is surprised to hear Dead by Daylight.

182
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Nobody is surprised to hear that.

183
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,740
I'm sure like I just knowing you like that game, I feel like has been transformative

184
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,100
for your online presence.

185
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,740
And I mean that as a compliment, like like you're you're motivated on Twitch in a way

186
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,100
I've never seen you before.

187
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,100
You're not.

188
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,100
I got bullied off Twitch before.

189
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Yeah.

190
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
And people are idiots.

191
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,940
And but I'm glad you got back on the horse.

192
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:43,780
And maybe we have other, you know, women, other people of color, other trans folks.

193
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,220
I'm calling out the marginalized folks out there.

194
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,500
I think maybe we have a lot of them to thank for, you know, putting up with a lot of the

195
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,380
bullshit and make taking a hold of this platform and saying, we're not letting go.

196
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,620
We're not going anywhere.

197
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,500
Our voices are going to be heard, come together like no other.

198
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,900
And it's transferring over to VHS.

199
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Yeah.

200
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:12,700
Which, you know, I actually messaged the VHS devs because I mean, that's another one that

201
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,100
I would love to play.

202
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
It looks like a lot of fun.

203
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:21,100
I've been enjoying watching my friends play it and a little bit jealous.

204
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,940
But that one also just looks like it's super fun.

205
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,620
The community has been really supportive.

206
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,820
I haven't had the degree of toxicity.

207
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,460
I haven't noticed it.

208
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,180
Amongst some of the player base.

209
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,380
Then again, it is, you know, it's in a beta, a closed beta.

210
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:43,860
But I would even put that as like, if I had to say something that came out quote, because,

211
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,660
you know, it was in beta at the end of the year.

212
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,020
I'd say VHS would probably be up there in the new game category, even though I haven't

213
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,020
played it.

214
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,780
It looks like it's a lot of fun.

215
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Very 80s-tastic.

216
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,780
Yeah.

217
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,040
I've, I've, I've watched some of the streamers you and I both watch because we're always

218
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,180
watching the same person.

219
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,420
It seems play that game.

220
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,700
Well, I think that some of our mutual friends have just thought it was hilarious by now

221
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,180
that we kind of read about it.

222
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
I'm sure.

223
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,820
I get VHS yet, like the play of it, but it's, it's because I just, I need to play it until

224
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,580
I like really understand it.

225
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,340
It's just, yeah, whatever.

226
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,220
The thing is, is it's, you're crafting stun weapons or kill weapons and the teens are

227
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,220
stuck in like a teen movie with one of them turning into the monster.

228
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,220
I love the aesthetic.

229
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,220
I love the aesthetic.

230
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,460
The teens have to kill the monster or the monster kills the teens.

231
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,440
So this is a game where you fight back.

232
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,080
And apparently the communication is definitely the key in this game.

233
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,800
Like way much more because in Dead by Daylight, you can sort of like, if you're solo queue,

234
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,120
you can sort of just, you know, fuck around and do your own thing and maybe still make

235
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,880
it out of the game.

236
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,120
But I've noticed in VHS, if there's not communication, if one falls, all fall.

237
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Yeah.

238
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Yeah.

239
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Okay.

240
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,760
So that's kind of my take on it.

241
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:09,640
But I've, I did actually reach out to the, on their Twitter to see if there were any

242
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,720
plans for a Mac release or if it runs in Windows ARM, because I'm running Windows 11 ARM in

243
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,080
Parallels and there's still some games that, that won't play on it.

244
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:25,800
And I'm actually really irritated at the anti-cheat that Dead by Daylight uses because the anti-cheat

245
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,560
doesn't run in an ARM environment, but Dead by Daylight does.

246
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,880
And when I try to run the game without the anti-cheat, it tells me I'm not connected

247
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
to Steam.

248
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Right.

249
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Right.

250
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,920
So, and I haven't been able to figure any way around it so I can actually play it on

251
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:48,800
Steam instead, but honestly enough, I'm still pretty happy with Stadia.

252
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,400
There's just been, I've found, you know, a few games since I've just got really, I got

253
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,160
a little bit bored with Dead by Daylight and started trying to stream some other stuff

254
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,880
and Cyberpunk 2077 is actually not really to my liking.

255
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,880
I don't like first person games.

256
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,120
I saw you playing something really random the other night.

257
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
I can't remember what it was.

258
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Demons Tilt?

259
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,480
No, it was something else.

260
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Oh, Muse Dash.

261
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,240
Yeah, I saw you playing Muse Dash.

262
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
I love Muse Dash.

263
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,800
Muse Dash is pretty fun and really simple, but I'm also playing it on my iPhone so I

264
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:24,000
don't always want to, it's a little bit interesting to play like through Steam, but it's fun.

265
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't get me wrong.

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,440
I love the music in it.

267
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,520
But I'm also, though, I'd have to say that like the best RPG that I have played in the

268
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,200
last several years, though, I'm going to put Fantasian up on that list because the story

269
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,920
is really good.

270
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:49,040
I've made it through a lot of combat for the game really easily, but the boss battles are

271
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,280
harder than advertised.

272
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:58,800
It's definitely something that you're going to have to redo your growth path in the game.

273
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,920
Like you can actually channel your skill points into different skills on a branching tree.

274
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,200
And I've actually had to go in and redo entire sets of them for some of the battles in the

275
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,600
game.

276
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,120
Like there's one that I have to take all of, I have counter on most of the characters because

277
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,080
typically having counter is really good, it's extra attack, but I had to turn off counter

278
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,840
for all of this one battle because if you hit one of the little sub creatures, it causes

279
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,840
a chain reaction to make all of them explode and then it will kill you.

280
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,160
So you have to do this like vacuum skill that sucks them all off to the side so that you

281
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,640
don't accidentally hit one when you hit the main baddie because some people have piercing

282
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,960
attacks that will go through lines of characters.

283
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,880
And the way that you can chain and pierce your attacks, it is so unique.

284
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,560
Not to mention the backgrounds and the levels are all hand-built diorama.

285
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,360
So there's a lot of care that went into that game and it's a care I haven't seen in a game

286
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,480
in quite some time.

287
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,200
So I'm pretty happy with it.

288
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,260
You're not the first to really rave about that game.

289
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,520
One of my other friends says that that's his favorite game of the entire year too, who

290
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
plays a lot of RPGs.

291
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,400
So I really trust his opinion.

292
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,420
Not that I don't trust yours, but I just seeing it in multiple places when I don't think a

293
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,520
ton of people are playing that game because it is limited to Apple Arcade right now.

294
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
And I'm not sure.

295
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
You can play it on your iPhone.

296
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,400
Oh yeah, I know, but I'm not sure a lot of people are exploring that.

297
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,100
Actually I'll just go ahead and say this right now.

298
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:50,780
You can use my Apple Arcade subscription on the, uh, on the, uh, uh, OLR account.

299
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,780
I'll get around to it eventually.

300
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,180
My backlog is gigantic.

301
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,180
That's just one of many games sitting in my backlog right now.

302
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,300
This has superseded a lot of different games that I've acquired.

303
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
I get it.

304
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,420
Um, although I did buy battle of the gods.

305
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,020
It's by the same people that do battle of the animals.

306
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,020
Hmm.

307
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,260
Um, you can play Jesus versus Santa Claus.

308
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:19,140
It's very sacrilegious and I'm kind of, I'm kind of like, I don't believe in disrespecting

309
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:27,820
faiths, but at the same time, you know, the old, uh, Southern Baptist, sorry, there's

310
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,020
something flying around.

311
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,980
There's the old Southern Baptist in me.

312
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:39,380
That's just sort of like getting a kick at knocking, you know, all right.

313
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
Sorry.

314
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,420
Not, not knocking Midna.

315
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,820
She just jumped down and made a noise, but, but you know what I mean?

316
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
That's God telling you to watch it.

317
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,100
Cat, stop it.

318
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
All right.

319
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
She's okay.

320
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,100
Sorry.

321
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,100
She's, she's getting into stuff.

322
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,660
Let me, uh, let me go over to Loki and it, cause I, I actually have no idea what Loki's

323
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
going to answer this with.

324
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,780
Uh, so I'm, I'm super curious, uh, your game or games of the year.

325
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,780
Loki.

326
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,500
Oh, my, my games.

327
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:15,100
Um, well, I didn't play that many this year, so, um, I mean, I guess if I can do like a

328
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:22,460
top three or something, uh, we can do power washing SIM cause that's, that's awesome.

329
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,900
That's, that's a pick that was going through my head too.

330
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Absolutely.

331
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,660
So yeah, power washing simulator, uh, hotshots racing, pretty cool.

332
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,660
Yep.

333
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,460
Uh, that was pretty solid racing game.

334
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,580
Um, I mean, obviously Minecraft and my game.

335
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,580
Sure.

336
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,260
I was, I was going to put pixel poops number two on my list, but then it was like conflict

337
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
of interest.

338
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,260
What?

339
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,260
It's fine.

340
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,260
Ethics.

341
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
What?

342
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,260
All right.

343
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:59,340
And that's probably like the only games that I, I played this year.

344
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,060
So that's, I mean, that's going to be it.

345
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,740
Um, for me, um, so I have kind of like three different answers.

346
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,900
It's not a top three, but the three different mindsets I've been in and approaching this

347
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,020
question.

348
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,660
And at first I was like, all right, if I'm going to just do the traditional pick, I mean,

349
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,980
I also, I kind of feel like Loki, I haven't played a lot, a lot of games this year.

350
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,460
That doesn't mean I, I dislike gaming or I should be unqualified from talking about video

351
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,460
gaming.

352
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,900
I just feel like a lot of the old standbys, a lot of the gold classics have really carried

353
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,020
me through this year and I haven't been very adventurous exploring a lot of new titles.

354
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,780
Um, and I think there's a lot of factors that play into that and that's just the way it

355
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,940
is that made up my year.

356
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,700
It doesn't make me any less of a gaming fan just because I'm playing classics.

357
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,260
Um, but I think, you know, if I were to take this question from a traditional perspective,

358
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,100
I'd probably say, eh, probably Forza Horizon 5, you know, it was a game I was super hyped

359
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,700
about, loved Forza Horizon 4, Forza Horizon 5 is like more of the same and is that a bad

360
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
thing?

361
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Absolutely not.

362
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,540
There's so much to see and do in that game.

363
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,800
It's great.

364
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,380
But the more I kind of thought about it, like honestly, I was, I was totally prepared to

365
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,680
come into the show tonight and give the big spiel about why I think the, the 2022 game

366
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
of the year.

367
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,140
I mean, there's, there's been a lot of not, excuse me, the 2021 game of the year that

368
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,820
we're talking about in 2022.

369
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,540
Um, I honestly think there's been a lot of stuff this year that's not great about gaming.

370
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,020
Um, from the technical and logistical perspective of, I still can't go into target and get a

371
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,420
PlayStation five.

372
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,100
These things are still being scalped.

373
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,580
Same thing with series X series S I guess is getting a little bit easier.

374
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,420
I mean, you can buy those on Woot now, but you know, for the most part, the next generation

375
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,500
of gaming is still inaccessible for a lot of people.

376
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,520
And you put on top of that, the fact that, um, there's been a lot of bullshit in our

377
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,560
industry that's really floated to the top, um, this year between what's going on with

378
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,760
Activision blizzard, Ubisoft.

379
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,520
I mean, we talked about it weeks and weeks on the show and the reckoning needed to happen.

380
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,320
But the fact that a lot of this bullshit is still out there and exacerbated by the fact

381
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,160
that Bobby Kotick is still the CEO of Activision for some stupid reason.

382
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,240
Um, I honestly was ready to walk in here tonight and say, I think the game of the year for

383
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,760
2021 is nothing.

384
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,080
And I think for the 20 years we've been doing this show, I think I probably would be fully

385
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,520
justified in saying, I think this year, more than any other, nothing deserves to be the

386
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,080
game of the year.

387
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,660
Um, and it's not to say that every game that came out there year was bad.

388
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,480
That's not what I'm saying, but I'm just saying our industry is, is not in a great point.

389
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,320
And there was nothing that really grabbed me away from the old reliables, the old comfort

390
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,280
foods.

391
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,120
And I'm not sure 2021 was very successful in pushing things forward in the industry.

392
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,240
In fact, it felt like a step backwards.

393
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,680
So in a way, honestly, in many ways, my answer is 2021's game of the year is nothing.

394
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,400
Um, but then I, I really, really, really, really, really thought about it and I've kind

395
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,880
of thought about, okay, if this is supposed to be my game of the year and me and the things

396
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,980
I've been going through and the things that I like, and a lot of the stuff that has been

397
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,840
very important to me in my journey with a lot of the health issues I've talked about,

398
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,220
um, in the past couple months, cause it really has been just the past few months and so forth.

399
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:37,800
I think I've landed on that my personal game of the year is Pikmin Bloom, um, which probably

400
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,840
isn't that surprising.

401
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,980
I've always been a shill of some sorts for Niantic games just because I've really enjoyed

402
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,680
things like Ingress, um, Pokemon Go.

403
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,440
Um, heck, I played that Harry Potter game when it first came out before, you know, You

404
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,680
Know Who was all over Twitter and we're not going to go there.

405
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,320
Uh, I really was looking forward to the Catan, uh, and there are other releases.

406
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
So, um, yeah, sure.

407
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,480
Of course, there's always going to be that element of, and even non Niantic things like

408
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Orna.

409
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,540
Um, I've always been super into like the GPS phone games, but I think Pikmin, while still

410
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:12,120
having a ways to go and making that game better and a more, um, quality product, I think there's

411
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,940
some game balance, some serious game balance issues and shop, uh, micro transaction balance

412
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,560
issues the game has to address.

413
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,960
And it's, it's really echoing a lot of the same stuff that's all over Reddit and all

414
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
of that.

415
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,800
But I think what the game has done very well is very well is it's done a very good job

416
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,800
incentivizing walking without making it feel like too much, because let's be real in Ingress.

417
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,280
A lot of people don't walk most of those portals and things that you got, you don't really

418
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
walk to them.

419
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,520
People are using their cars, their drive-bys.

420
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,160
So yes, some portals are harder to get to than others and you have to walk to get them.

421
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Sure.

422
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,280
Um, but you know, and I, I spent, especially those darn ones behind, you know, locked gates

423
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
and property.

424
00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:00,720
I'm just saying, and I've spent more hours than, um, than not, uh, you know, playing

425
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,680
Ingress probably, you know, so far, I'm not like knocking the game, but it's just, I,

426
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,680
you don't really walk and get exercise playing that game.

427
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,640
Um, Pokemon Go, same thing.

428
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,120
It's a lot of drive-bys.

429
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,240
It's a lot of, you know, that sort of thing in your car, catching Pokemon and maybe community

430
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,280
days kind of get you out walking around.

431
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,000
But even then there's a lot of stop, catch, go, stop, catch, go, stop, catch, go, right?

432
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,840
Like Pokemon isn't really about the fitness for a lot of people.

433
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,980
I think Pikmin has found that really good balance where you set it, forget it and move

434
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,180
to get your rewards.

435
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,020
And again, I don't think the game is perfect, but I'm just saying that I've walked a half

436
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,100
a million steps in the last couple months.

437
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,140
And this is the time more than anything I've needed incentive to keep me good and keep

438
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,640
me on this track I've been on and Pikmin Bloom's been able to do that for me.

439
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,560
So I think in many ways, the game is probably like the right place at the right time sort

440
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,760
of thing, but I'm not going to apologize for the fact that those factors make it my favorite

441
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,500
game of the year.

442
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,120
So that's my answer.

443
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,340
Looking at some comments in chat, Tiger Claw says, give it to Nintendo.

444
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
What about Metroid Dread?

445
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,340
I did give it to Nintendo.

446
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,340
I love Metroid.

447
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:24,660
I haven't finished Dread yet because I had some pain playing it.

448
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:31,660
The control issues in that game, hold it back from being number one for me a little bit.

449
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,800
Adris in chat says Endwalker for me.

450
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
Great answer.

451
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
I love Endwalker.

452
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,180
I love Final Fantasy 14.

453
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,920
I hate the sound issues that still aren't fixed.

454
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,480
Hopefully they're supposed to be in the next patch.

455
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,760
I hate the cue issues that have arisen.

456
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
I still love Endwalker.

457
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,520
I still love Final Fantasy 14, but I'm not sure I felt as good about it as I did Shadow

458
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:01,040
Bringers, which was in my top three the year that came out.

459
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,420
And Black Compat in chat.

460
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,420
Hi there.

461
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,300
I hope everybody's following your channel, by the way.

462
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,340
Black Compat says Ubi, Acti, Bungie.

463
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,060
So much Kaka duty going on in the industry.

464
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,060
Absolutely.

465
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,220
And that's why I think in many ways, like the maybe the game of the year, I know I said

466
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:23,540
nothing, but maybe the game of the year needs to be the workers, the frontline workers,

467
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,340
the people that need the credit and do the work for what's going on.

468
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,960
And I'm not sure exactly how to articulate that, because I know nothing sounds like a

469
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,040
big negative, but I think I say that more like the industry kind of needs to take a

470
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,600
look at itself sort of thing.

471
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
That makes sense.

472
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
I don't know.

473
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Anyway.

474
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
OK.

475
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,740
So that was looking backward.

476
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,000
Let's look forward.

477
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,280
What do we predict?

478
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,440
Now we're not in person, so I don't have the little robot and all that stuff, but we can

479
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,560
always make a clip out of this Darth Vader 10 and revisit it later of our 2022 predictions.

480
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,160
So I'm curious, what do you guys think is going to happen in the industry in 2022?

481
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,380
Do you have any safe predictions or outrageous predictions?

482
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,380
What are your guesses?

483
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,080
So Dark Sakura, I'll start with you again.

484
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,860
What is one prediction you have about the games industry for 2022?

485
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,680
As much as I hate it, they are still going to try to pull this NFT bullshit.

486
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,120
The NFT bullshit is not going to slow down.

487
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Interesting.

488
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,720
Because I know we have a story coming up on that later.

489
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
We do.

490
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,920
That indicates companies don't learn.

491
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Interesting.

492
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
OK.

493
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:38,720
I think that they're going to find some other way to make it attractive or just do it anyway.

494
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,120
And people are going to want to play certain things.

495
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,720
You're going to do it with the with the irresistible title.

496
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,460
I think there is something to that.

497
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,520
And I tend to agree that they're going to force the narrative to be NFTs are a success

498
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,560
because they're going to tie it to something that's not going to fail.

499
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,140
They're going to tie it to make it sound like they're spending their in-game currency.

500
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,140
Yes.

501
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,140
To buy a thing.

502
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,140
Yes.

503
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,180
But they have to spend money to buy their in-game currency.

504
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:15,060
And they will own this thing, yes, because it is an NFT, but it has in the end cost actual

505
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,860
money for them to acquire the points to buy the item.

506
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,340
And as far as they know, it's in game.

507
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,620
It's an in-game item.

508
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,620
They'll tie.

509
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,560
They're going to make it entirely deceptive.

510
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,900
They'll tie FIFA packs to NFTs or something like that and say, oh, look at what a success

511
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,260
NFTs are when it's like people weren't buying it for that.

512
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,140
They're buying it for other stuff.

513
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
Right.

514
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,180
So that's where I think it's going to go.

515
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,180
OK.

516
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,140
It's going to have to become a deceptive practice.

517
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,180
Just kind of like how loot crates, you know, were a fairly deceptive practice.

518
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,260
All right.

519
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,260
I get it.

520
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
I'm with you there.

521
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,820
I kind of agree with that one.

522
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,980
Loki, what about one of yours?

523
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,420
Bobby Kotick is still going to be CEO of Activision Blizzard and he's going to even receive more

524
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
money this year.

525
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
I hate that.

526
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,420
I hate it.

527
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,340
I don't disagree.

528
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,700
It's ridiculous for me.

529
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Let's see.

530
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
I'm going to predict.

531
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,460
If Loki is going to take a safe one, I'm going to play a safe one, too.

532
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,540
I think there will be a new Xbox series underscore for the holiday.

533
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:28,460
I think this latest Xbox thing was kind of designed to do that, where they're going to

534
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,740
release another thing in the series line is kind of like maybe the Xbox Pro or something

535
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
like that.

536
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,740
I don't know.

537
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
But I think I think that would be a thing.

538
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,060
I predict there's going to be an Xbox series.

539
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,540
Why or something this year?

540
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:48,660
I'll say X-Box series, double X, the Xbox series, triple X. All right.

541
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,460
Any more anyone wants to throw out there?

542
00:27:51,460 --> 00:28:00,820
I'll open this up to our chatters as well.

543
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,820
I don't know.

544
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:09,780
Like, it's just it's the same disappointment all year round.

545
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:14,060
S.S.G.A. 100 Matt says, will you be able to go into a store and get a PlayStation 5 this

546
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
year?

547
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
No.

548
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
No.

549
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,860
I think we're I think it'll still go the whole way to and I think that the VR thing

550
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,020
is going to have the same problem.

551
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:31,460
And I also think this is why and I'm going to say no Nintendo Switch upgrade this year

552
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,380
or well, no major Nintendo Switch upgrade this year.

553
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,580
They'll do something like, you know, LED, you know, something that's that's minorly

554
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,580
incremental.

555
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:47,820
But I predict no major switch update until I think they'll go with the off season again.

556
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,740
Nintendo doesn't need to be on the holiday.

557
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,420
I say March 2023.

558
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,420
I got one.

559
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,140
I got one.

560
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
OK.

561
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,740
The Intellivision MECO isn't coming out this year, and in fact, they don't release it.

562
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,300
They just canceled the project.

563
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:12,620
OK, OK, OK.

564
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,620
Let's see.

565
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,740
She Hulk in chat says game pass on Switch 2022.

566
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,420
There's something about that that doesn't click for me.

567
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,500
Like what does Nintendo have to gain from that?

568
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,740
That's the only thing that doesn't like like I want to see it.

569
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,740
Don't get me wrong.

570
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,620
I'm just not sure I understand what Nintendo would really get from that unless there's

571
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,420
something to be said about like Nintendo games on the Xbox platform, which makes absolutely

572
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,420
no sense.

573
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,420
I love that.

574
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,900
Yeah, like maybe money, I guess.

575
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,740
Yeah, maybe they throw a shitload of money at it.

576
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,740
Maybe.

577
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
Come on.

578
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,740
Pull a Sega.

579
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
It worked well for them.

580
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
Right.

581
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,740
Hey.

582
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:57,340
Adrian chat says attempt to tie games into the metaverse virtual spaces.

583
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,900
Oh, I kind of like that.

584
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
You know what?

585
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,860
I'll go with a crazy pick along those lines.

586
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm going to say that long rumored PlayStation home reboot for VR is a VR to launch thing.

587
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
Why not?

588
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,140
I'll go.

589
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
I'll go.

590
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,480
The PlayStation home reboot is a VR to thing.

591
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,540
I'll go with that.

592
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,540
I like that one.

593
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:26,860
OK, last call anymore.

594
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:32,660
World predictions, Sony, Microsoft, PlayStation, the rest of the industry arcades.

595
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,960
I think Stadia is going to keep going strong.

596
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,940
So Google will continue to invest in Stadia when a lot of people said they would throw

597
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
it away by now.

598
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:49,220
Yeah, I mean, indeed, there hasn't been any sort of notice about them slowing down with

599
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
it.

600
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,980
It apparently still seems to be making money.

601
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,660
And there is quite a bit of a following around it now.

602
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,100
The cult of Stadia grows.

603
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,420
OK, I got some great games on there, too.

604
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,700
I mean, I'll just put it out there.

605
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:09,140
And then Epic is going to continue to bite off of everybody else's ideas.

606
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,140
You know what, though?

607
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,620
I was just going to say Dark Soccer talking about Stadia, I think maybe answered the question

608
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,620
for me.

609
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,220
What could Nintendo and Microsoft have to gain from a game pass partnership?

610
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:26,660
I think if Nintendo is able to have a Microsoft cloud player, I think that's what it would

611
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,660
be.

612
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,540
Not Game Pass directly, reinstall the games.

613
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:36,440
But if Nintendo Switch devices had a Microsoft cloud player on them to play Game Pass games.

614
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,420
Because Microsoft, I don't think, is interested in that portable gaming space.

615
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,420
We've never seen them go.

616
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,780
I mean, yes, they have tablets, sure.

617
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:51,240
But they realize, Phil Spencer and many people at Microsoft realize the Nintendo Switch has

618
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:59,180
broken through in a way that no Windows Phone or Surface tablet or any of Microsoft's to-go

619
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,780
products are ever going to get to.

620
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:07,380
And I think if Microsoft, maybe the alliance is, they'll do advertising for Nintendo Switch

621
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,980
because Nintendo Switch plays the Microsoft cloud platform.

622
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,940
I think that's where the agreement could ultimately be.

623
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,340
So I will say, you gave me that aha moment in talking about Stadia.

624
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,940
I think that's the win for that alliance happening.

625
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,900
Ooh, Mike Deftonchat says, E3 will turn into Summer Games Fest.

626
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,040
ESA will let Jeff just do it all for them next year.

627
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,100
Bobby Blackwolf says, the ESA wouldn't do that at this point.

628
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,580
Too much animosity.

629
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,140
They'll go under first.

630
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,140
Thank you.

631
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,140
That's a great prediction.

632
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,940
The ESA goes under in 2023.

633
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:50,500
There is no E3 2023 because people finally realize the ESA is a horribly managed organization

634
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:56,580
that has grown behind the curve for far too long and has not been able to innovate in

635
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,740
a way that a tech company needs to be able to innovate.

636
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,580
So I think, thank you, Bobby.

637
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,620
I think that's a pretty, maybe we're a little ways out, but I think there is no talk of

638
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,620
ever returning to an in-person E3, and it has nothing to do with COVID.

639
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,620
Let's see.

640
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,580
Dark Tetsuya says, I know Switch does have a few cloud-based games, so if they could

641
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,180
set up a full-on service for it, sure.

642
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,940
Yes, I think there's a lot of good stuff there.

643
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,940
Mike Deftonchat says, I would have gone with my yearly prediction of E3 and ESA disappearing,

644
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,660
but it would have been three years in a row now.

645
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,860
This is the year to do it, Deft.

646
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
This is the year.

647
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,620
S2 100 Matt says, the new Saints Row game comes out and Loki likes it.

648
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,140
I'm not sure if that's a safe prediction.

649
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,900
I think it's a wishful one.

650
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,620
I mean, I'll probably play it.

651
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,660
I mean, I'm definitely going to play it.

652
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,660
I would hope so.

653
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
It's like you're serious.

654
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,100
Yeah, it is.

655
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,580
And after all, like, you know, what am I going to do, wait until Grand Theft Auto 6 comes

656
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
out?

657
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,580
I mean, come on.

658
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Yikes.

659
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,300
All right.

660
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,900
I mean, it's just going to take, like, several decades for them to release it.

661
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,900
OK, OK.

662
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,380
Make this 2022 prediction then.

663
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,100
Do we see a frame of Grand Theft Auto 6?

664
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
No.

665
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
OK.

666
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
None.

667
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Zero.

668
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,900
There'll be no announcements for Grand Theft Auto 6.

669
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,780
All right.

670
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,780
Let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have

671
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,580
been playing this week.

672
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,180
And we'll start with Dark Sakura.

673
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,780
How was your gaming week?

674
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,980
I played a lot of Dead by Daylight.

675
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:47,500
I played 12 and a half hours of Dead by Daylight on Wednesday, and nobody really did anything.

676
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,100
I was lurking for a little bit.

677
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:55,860
Yeah, but I was, you know, trying to do a joinathon, hopefully, you know, get some more

678
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,860
people interested.

679
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,260
And I did get three adepts, though, by the way.

680
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
There you go.

681
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:07,020
I adapted Legion, I adapted Trickster and Clown.

682
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,820
The thing is, is that I still have, like, 10 cakes left on Trickster, so I have to play

683
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:17,140
him some more to use up those cakes before I, what's the word, prestige him?

684
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,020
And I've been prestige-ing characters.

685
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:25,060
So to date, the adepts that I have, and keep in mind, I am a mediocre player, so me getting

686
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,940
any kind of adept is, like, a big deal for me.

687
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:34,620
So I have Clown, Doctor, Ghostface, Hag, Huntress, which I did nothing but M1 Huntress.

688
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,980
I didn't throw a single hatchet.

689
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,900
I had a challenge to hit 10 people with just the regular axe.

690
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,700
So I put on that thing that gives her, like, great movement speed when she doesn't have

691
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,520
any hatchets, and then that thing that reduces her hatchets to one hatchet.

692
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,140
So I got rid of my one hatchet, and I was instantly fast.

693
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,260
And it was funny that people afterwards thought that it was hilarious.

694
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,020
So I had a lot of fun.

695
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:07,460
I also got, so I had Legion, Nightmare, Nurse, which I either had really new people because

696
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:13,260
they were all Ash, or they were memeing, and that was fine.

697
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,700
I don't mind them helping me get adept because that means I don't have to try on Nurse ever

698
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
again.

699
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Yeah.

700
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,540
And Trapper and Trickster, like I said, so those are the ones that I have.

701
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,900
I'm working on Pig right now, which is...

702
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,180
That's a hard one, I hear.

703
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
It's a hard one.

704
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,180
Her perks suck.

705
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,180
I don't think I have a lot of adept killers.

706
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,220
I've only done as well as I have because I'm decent at Pig.

707
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,180
I have a lot of adept survivors because all you have to do is get out, and you just, sometimes

708
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,060
you luck out, and you just have a killer that can't get you, and you get out and you get

709
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,140
the adept.

710
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:46,260
But killer ones are hard because you have to, like, you have to play a max game, basically.

711
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,100
You have to double pip with only their base talents, which is tricky.

712
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,020
You have to be way on top of your game, and I think it's highly imbalanced.

713
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,060
I think it should be Blood Points.

714
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:02,380
Yeah, and I don't think any killer, their three set base perk set is good.

715
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,700
I don't think any killer has all three.

716
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,500
I was gonna say Hag.

717
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,940
I was gonna say Hag probably is the quote-unquote easiest.

718
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,060
In fact, I think I might have adept Hag, so.

719
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:18,860
And I will just say this, that the easiest of them all for me to get was Trapper.

720
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,860
First try.

721
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,860
Interesting.

722
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:26,300
First try, but I lucked into the survivors that I got.

723
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,700
And they were basically just letting me practice blinking the entire time.

724
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,820
Like until I could get my blinks down.

725
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:41,740
Sorry to interrupt, but of course, because you guys had to all jinx it for us for 2022,

726
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,740
we just got the power company coming to our door saying that they're gonna shut the power

727
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,020
off at some point for an hour.

728
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,420
Thanks, you guys.

729
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,420
Tonight?

730
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,420
Tonight.

731
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,420
Anytime.

732
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,780
Because they're working on something.

733
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,740
So thank you, 2022.

734
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,700
We're just never gonna have a show, I guess, or a full show.

735
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
I hate it here.

736
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,020
All right, we'll get through as much as we can, and at least when we lose, Loki will

737
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
know why.

738
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,020
Jesus.

739
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,020
Yeah.

740
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
All right, Loki.

741
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,100
For fuck's sake.

742
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Dark soccer.

743
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,420
I don't mean to cut you off, but we probably should get to Loki's game a week.

744
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,420
I'll finish mine after Loki.

745
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,660
Okay, Loki, how was your game a week?

746
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,420
It's all Minecraft and debugging stuff with our server, trying to figure out why it's

747
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,580
laggy.

748
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,580
No idea.

749
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
Still trying to figure it out.

750
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,580
Is it running on Comcast?

751
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,580
I put out my new episode, though.

752
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,580
I think there's a new episode out.

753
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,780
I did see a new YouTube in our Discord server.

754
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
Oh, yeah.

755
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
So check that out.

756
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
Okay, awesome.

757
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,580
All right, Jamie, go ahead and finish up.

758
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,500
I also played Demon's Tilt.

759
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,140
That game is super fun.

760
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,940
And of course, Fantasian.

761
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:54,300
How can I leave out Fantasian, which I don't know what it is, but two of the boss battles

762
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,940
that were giving me the biggest fits, I just blew them away.

763
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,380
They were easy after that.

764
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,900
And then I got to a place that I'm not supposed to do yet.

765
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,420
So I played a little bit of it, and I'm backtracking some.

766
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,420
What?

767
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,420
All right.

768
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,780
But it's fun.

769
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,780
It's really great.

770
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,900
Everyone should play it.

771
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,900
My gaming week.

772
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,660
Honestly, with the internet issues, it kind of cut into some stuff.

773
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:28,820
So I didn't get to play a whole lot, but I did play some Final Fantasy XIV, of course.

774
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:33,540
So my Gunbreaker got through the main scenario and is level 90.

775
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,620
That all happened weeks ago, but now my Bard is level 90 as well.

776
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,500
Bard's a lot of fun to play this time around.

777
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,240
I've been kind of sleeping on it the last couple of expansions, but Bard's really cool

778
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
this time.

779
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,080
So I got Bard to 90, and then I've been working on crafting gatherings.

780
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,360
So my minor botanist and then four of my crafters are all level 90 as well.

781
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,720
So I've been pushing some of my classes there and just trying to do my daily dungeons to

782
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,080
get tomes and all that good stuff.

783
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,320
So there's that.

784
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,960
I've also been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, no real accomplishments to scream

785
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
about.

786
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,880
Oh, I had such a bad squad today.

787
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,280
I got that achievement for hooking three people in the basement.

788
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,560
I thought you had to do it all at the same time, but apparently no, because I hooked

789
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,920
a Mikaela who died down there.

790
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,240
I was playing Freddy and I was a mean Freddy too.

791
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,340
I was, you know, because I had a daily or something like that.

792
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:26,000
So I hooked somebody down there and then I hooked two others after that.

793
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,600
And I got, I wasn't trying to do a basement build, it was just very convenient.

794
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
And I got that achievement.

795
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,480
I was like, oh, I thought this would be a lot harder to get.

796
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
Who knew?

797
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,360
So you just have to hook three people in one game?

798
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
Yeah.

799
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
In the basement.

800
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
That's an achievement.

801
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Do you know what it's called?

802
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,400
Something about like holiday gathering or something, because it talks about the holiday

803
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
tree or something.

804
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,320
Cause that's what it's, uh, yeah.

805
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:51,960
I think you might have to, uh, yeah, holiday, it might have to be sacrificing three people

806
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
in the basement specifically.

807
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
But I did do that.

808
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,240
In a public match have at least three survivors hooked in the basement at the same time.

809
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,800
Oh, happy holiday.

810
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,080
No, there's, uh, milk and cookies.

811
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,880
Um, no, the holiday get together means have three hooked in the basement at the same time.

812
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
And guess what?

813
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
It bugged for me.

814
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,800
Cause Michaela was D E D dead, uh, when I hooked the other two.

815
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,520
So that's, that's fascinating.

816
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,680
I hooked one of them.

817
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,680
Did they eat off the hook?

818
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,720
No, I went wild.

819
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
So I got an achievement.

820
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,920
I probably shouldn't have gotten bugs in my Debbie.

821
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,560
Uh, let's see, uh, what other games did I play this week?

822
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,720
I played just a little bit of no man's sky.

823
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,720
I'm waiting to see if they start up an expedition five or what I've been watching Alan play

824
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
a lot of it.

825
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,200
Uh, and, uh, we are going to do a multiplayer game hopefully real soon.

826
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
So that'll be fun.

827
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,400
Um, other than that location based games and the only other basement ones, there's Texas

828
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,680
barbecue where you hook 25 survivors in the basement once per survivor per match.

829
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,680
Huh?

830
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,640
Then holiday get together is the one that you just got.

831
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
Yeah.

832
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
That's the one.

833
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Wow.

834
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
All right.

835
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:06,280
Um, you know, maybe it was bugging out in the way that, um, sometimes you run by a hook

836
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,520
and you still hear the noises of someone on it, even though they've long been sacrificed.

837
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Yeah.

838
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,560
I bet it's doing that because I think I did have them on three different hooks.

839
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,560
I think that actually happens when someone is spectating.

840
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Oh, maybe.

841
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Maybe.

842
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
All right.

843
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Anyway.

844
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Very likely.

845
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
But, but anyway.

846
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
Yeah.

847
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
Yeah.

848
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
All right.

849
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
Uh, let's move on.

850
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,560
Get into some gaming news.

851
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,840
Um, Loki start us off while you still can.

852
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Yeah.

853
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:40,880
So apparently, um, take two has purchased Zynga because take two is kind of a toxic

854
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,480
company and now they purchase part of Activision Blizzard or wait, what's that part of Activision

855
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
Blizzard?

856
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,640
No, you're thinking King, King Candy Crush mobile companies.

857
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,240
I confuse them in essentially the same, um, no anyways.

858
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,960
So yeah, they purchase Zynga now because you know, how else do we compete with, you know,

859
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,840
Activision Blizzard, but we'll have our own mobile company that, you know, they'll push

860
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
out some other stuff.

861
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,280
So they bought them for $12.7 billion.

862
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,320
And honestly, I could not tell you what they have, uh, worked on recently, but apparently

863
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,940
they're going to be maybe possibly bringing, you know, some of the take two franchises

864
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,240
to mobile platforms.

865
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,000
Looking forward to that mobile version of Bioshock.

866
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,800
How much did they pay for Zynga?

867
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,600
Because when I heard the amount, I was like, they're worth that much.

868
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Like, sorry.

869
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
I'm not trying to be rude.

870
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,600
Prize.

871
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,600
Yeah.

872
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,000
Considering that like, but the Farmville days are long gone.

873
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,520
Those are long behind us.

874
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,120
Like what games is he?

875
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,120
Okay.

876
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,320
Does Zynga make one of those games where like, okay, there was the one that Mariah

877
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,680
Carey was in the commercial and now there's a new one.

878
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,560
Alan was showing me this commercial that Kathy Bates was in and it's, and I've, I've seen

879
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,260
this commercial without the celebrities.

880
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,560
It's something about like a grandma with a, uh, a mystery or something.

881
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,720
And she's like, like the whole commercial is like, grandma's being taken away in the

882
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,600
back of a cop car and she holds up a sign that says like, he's still alive and all this

883
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
stuff.

884
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,880
And then, and it's a fucking match three game and it's like, yeah, it's not that.

885
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,280
So they've put out like, um, some of their games that they put out recently, CSR racing

886
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,480
to Zynga poker, a bunch of slot machine games.

887
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,520
And then I guess they're also working on star Wars hunters, which is an arena combat game

888
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,720
that's coming out on mobile and switch.

889
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,720
I don't know.

890
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,440
I don't think they're worth $12 billion, but I don't need, I forgot the Zynga starting

891
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,300
to get into consoles though.

892
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,360
Merge mansion.

893
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,360
That's the name of it.

894
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,720
So I'm totally giving them a free prop.

895
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,120
I should make sure it's not a ABK product because we banned them from the show, but

896
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,880
I don't think it, Oh, meta core is the name of the company.

897
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,960
So it's not even Zynga, some new company, uh, that has apparently it has made $38 million

898
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,480
with some weird ass fucking commercials, the newest one having Kathy Bates on it.

899
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,480
So wild.

900
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Yeah.

901
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,480
All right.

902
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,000
Uh, Bobby points out, Rob, there's a Zynga developer.

903
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,320
It was on your dragon con panel.

904
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,320
She's working on hunters.

905
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,880
I had no idea that was a Zynga product.

906
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,200
I really didn't.

907
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,720
Let's see.

908
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,140
And uh, black and Pat says Zynga has a strong partnership with Hasbro.

909
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,060
So boggle words with friends, all the damn farm bills.

910
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,580
So many words with friends.

911
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,580
Okay.

912
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:37,380
That's one that I know is still big, um, and still does very well, uh, even amongst the

913
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,900
wordle of the world.

914
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,900
Oh, I don't think that made the show tonight, but, um, you know, all those knockoff wordle

915
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,460
clones got like yanked from the Apple store and I think Google play as well.

916
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,060
Um, I thought that was very interesting is that, uh, those wordle clones, which is weird

917
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,580
because wordle isn't really an original concept.

918
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:02,460
Um, the, the game show lingo was that, um, you know, it's nice to have that without that

919
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,100
asshole Chuck Woolery hosting, but, uh, you know, wordles kind of a different thing.

920
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,460
Um, so it's interesting that that'll got pulled.

921
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,140
I wonder if they are going to do an official app or something along those lines.

922
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,140
I don't know.

923
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,220
But word games are always very popular, you know, dark soccer talked about, talks about

924
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,220
that one every other week.

925
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,180
Uh, yeah, I always play word scapes.

926
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,180
Yeah.

927
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,260
Even I played that for a little bit.

928
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,780
So word games are very popular on mobile.

929
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,500
So, um, black and Pat bringing up words with friends.

930
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,940
That's definitely an aha moment.

931
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,380
I think that one's definitely worth something.

932
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:38,460
Um, Questbuster says last year was a bit rough for Zynga, but the acquisition fills in a

933
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,420
mobile gap for take two.

934
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,620
If I re if I recall correctly, only 10% of take two's business is dedicated to mobile.

935
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,820
You're probably right.

936
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,500
It's just, it still seems like such a lot of amount of money.

937
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,820
Oh my gosh.

938
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,820
All right.

939
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,300
Ah, mobile games, mobile games.

940
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,100
Have any of those crazy ads worked on any of you for mobile games?

941
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,900
Cause one that I left ads.

942
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:09,940
Well, I see them in, uh, like Instagram, like I, um, I was on, I don't, I don't, oh, you're

943
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,940
so edgy.

944
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,940
Oh my God.

945
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,940
You don't ever see ads.

946
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,940
You're so edgy.

947
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,660
No, I mean, I don't use Instagram hardly at all anymore.

948
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,660
You don't see ads anywhere?

949
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,100
I have an ad blocker, so.

950
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,100
On your mobile phone?

951
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,100
Yeah.

952
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,100
Okay.

953
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,100
I have an ad blocker on my phone.

954
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,100
Okay.

955
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,100
Ooh, she's different.

956
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,100
Um, all right.

957
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,340
Look, uh, I see, I see ads on Instagram, I see ads on TikTok, I said, but one of the

958
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:40,420
ones I saw on Instagram was a game called, um, I'm not, which is fine.

959
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,140
They're not paying me so I don't have to get the name right.

960
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:45,540
It was something like cat Island or something and it was a bunch of cats and it looked like

961
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,340
an animal crossing game where they were on an Island.

962
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,140
I was like, sign me the fuck up.

963
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,980
So I played it and I was like, oh, kitties.

964
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,500
And then I realized this isn't very good.

965
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,780
So but I was just curious if those ads have ever worked on people.

966
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,920
Those of you that, you know, are the, the, the, um, uh, the peons of the internet who

967
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,380
still see ads, um, Mike Deaf says nope.

968
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,980
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says everyone jokes about the raid shadow legends ads that streamers

969
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:13,980
get.

970
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,860
They're the audibles for podcasts of the streaming world.

971
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,020
Oh yeah, I've heard of that.

972
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,140
Cause that's the one that'll like pay you to do a sponsored stream and you get so much

973
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,180
money for every person that signs up or something.

974
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

975
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,180
I've heard of that.

976
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,180
All right.

977
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,180
I've still never played it though.

978
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,820
So my, my $3 or however much you get for, um, convincing someone to sign up is still

979
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,820
up for grabs.

980
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,820
I'll give you that.

981
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,820
All right.

982
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:41,300
Moving on for now though, let's talk about, uh, riot games and let's talk about a very

983
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,900
interesting change that they're making, uh, in their world is that they are going to allow

984
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:51,740
staff to leave with 25% of their salary, their yearly salary.

985
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:57,580
Uh, and uh, this is a, from a blog post where CEO Nicola Laurent, uh, talks about the plan

986
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:02,180
for the next five years in terms of the structure of the company and the content and the direction

987
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,180
they're going.

988
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,420
So I want to make clear when we talk about this, we're not talking about riot is laying

989
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,700
people off or I'm telling people they need to go somewhere else and doing a contract

990
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,740
buyout or, or just, well, there really is no contracts in California.

991
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,940
It's a, uh, um, right to work or whatever they call it, state, uh, at will.

992
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,940
That's it.

993
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,940
Uh, employment state.

994
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:25,540
Um, so, um, but my, but what I do think is interesting is that they're willing to basically

995
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:30,020
say, Hey, if you don't like the direction we're going in, here's the money for you to

996
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,020
leave.

997
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:35,740
Um, and it creates a very interesting temptation for people too, because you know, let's say

998
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,940
you make, I don't know, we'll say you make $80,000 a year.

999
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,940
I don't know.

1000
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:41,940
Let's say 60.

1001
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,940
We'll go, we'll drop it a little bit.

1002
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,940
So the math's easier.

1003
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,940
Uh, Oh no, it's 25.

1004
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,940
Sorry.

1005
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,940
I thought it was a third.

1006
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,940
So 25%.

1007
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,220
We'll say, we'll say 70,000 then.

1008
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,220
Okay.

1009
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:56,020
So seven, uh, divided by this is about 12, $12,500 or something like that.

1010
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,820
If you're willing to walk out the door right away, um, no 17.

1011
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,820
I can't math.

1012
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,260
Why did I sign up for math tonight anyway?

1013
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,960
A substantial amount of money.

1014
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,260
So if you don't agree with the, uh, vision that the company has for the future, you can

1015
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,260
walk away.

1016
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:17,420
I know Riot's been under the microscope when we talk about a lot of this whole like harassment

1017
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,460
and women getting treated shitty and all of this stuff, you know, Riot's been under the

1018
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,100
microscope for that.

1019
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:29,060
And I will say to the CEO's credit, uh, this bold new direction for Riot is going to have

1020
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,060
none of that.

1021
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,500
Uh, or, you know, obviously, you know what I mean?

1022
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,820
The vision has none of that and hopefully they are able to, uh, make that a successful

1023
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,780
in a implementation.

1024
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,920
So basically if you don't, if you think that we're being politically correct, or if you

1025
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,040
think this company is too woke, then you can walk.

1026
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,740
So I, I, I do appreciate that element of it, that Riot's basically paying people to leave

1027
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,740
if they don't like it.

1028
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,740
Get the hell out of here.

1029
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,220
Um, uh, this is a policy they've actually had in place for a while.

1030
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,400
Um, but they're kind of upping it for the month of January to this 25%.

1031
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:12,260
But I guess new people to the company, uh, can always take 10% of their annual to leave.

1032
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,640
Like if they don't like it during onboarding orientation, that's a thing they have.

1033
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,500
I think that's a very interesting thing for companies to put out there.

1034
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,500
But you know what?

1035
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,600
It might sound like a lot of money to pay somebody 10% of their salary, but you know

1036
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:27,400
what the cost to like onboard somebody, train somebody, get them access to equipment and

1037
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,400
all that stuff.

1038
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,920
And the, the hours you're paying that, you know what, it adds up.

1039
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,160
And so to pay them to walk away rather than invest that it makes you know that they really

1040
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,400
want to be here.

1041
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,280
So that's, uh, that's very interesting, I think.

1042
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,680
So we'll see.

1043
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,880
I'd be curious to see how many employees take it.

1044
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,600
That's what I'll be interested to hear.

1045
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,600
All right.

1046
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,840
I'm very, uh, oh, uh, S2100 Matt with a comment over twitch.tv slash vog network says, treat

1047
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,000
your employees well with respect.

1048
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,320
You will get a better product and a happier employee that goes for any industry.

1049
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,680
It just benefits everyone to treat everyone well.

1050
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,680
Yeah.

1051
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,960
I mean, I'm not my day job here very much, but if they offered me 25% to leave, I wouldn't,

1052
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,960
I wouldn't take it.

1053
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:13,040
I'd rather stay there for several more years, um, because I'm, I'm happy with it and happy

1054
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,480
with the direction they're going and, and all that stuff.

1055
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,680
So like this buyout thing wouldn't work with me.

1056
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,200
Um, but I, I bet that's not true of a lot of people out there who, if their company

1057
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,320
offered something like this, they probably would take it.

1058
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,160
Um, and I get it, I get it.

1059
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,160
All right.

1060
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,160
Uh, moving on dark Sakura.

1061
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,840
Um, I think this is very interesting, this, uh, very mainstream press article you've got

1062
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,840
for us.

1063
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:42,440
I, the only reason that I am going back into NFTs talking about it is because New York

1064
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,640
times covered it about how pissed we are.

1065
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,000
After our disastrous show last week, I thought I would say the one thing I'm happy about

1066
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,420
our show getting cut short by the internet.

1067
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,040
We didn't get around to the NFT stories.

1068
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,080
Darn the Lord works in mysterious ways.

1069
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,080
All right.

1070
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,440
But, but yes, the New York times talking about it is, is very newsworthy.

1071
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,440
Yeah.

1072
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,480
And there is a, actually, you know, basically these different companies are coming out with,

1073
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:17,640
with NFTs and related content, trying to push it for games that people are really looking

1074
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,720
forward to playing or are already playing.

1075
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:28,120
And then the moment that it hits the internet, the, sorry, hiccup, um, the players are rebelling

1076
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,000
against it immediately.

1077
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,600
You know, they're like, no, we know what you're trying to do and we don't like it.

1078
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:44,560
Um, there is, uh, uh, a person named Mutahar Anas who is a, uh, uh, has a pretty big YouTube.

1079
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,640
Um, and I'm just going to read the quote exactly because that's how I feel about it.

1080
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:54,800
Uh, people are being sold buzzwords, uh, th those pushing NFTs and games are trying to

1081
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,720
sell you snake oil.

1082
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:07,560
Um, and really this is going back into, uh, a lot having to do with, uh, just how people

1083
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,840
are a lot more savvy these days.

1084
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:15,000
You know, we were gamers in general are older.

1085
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:23,880
We've been through seeing off, um, we've seen some shit, we've seen some shit, we've seen

1086
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:30,240
loot crates and, and buying, uh, outfits for characters.

1087
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,960
And I mean, shoot, Final Fantasy 14 is pretty terrible about it.

1088
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,480
I think we lived in an era of the engage people.

1089
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:46,360
Yeah, the, but this is now taking all of the, you know, buying stuff with in-game currency

1090
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,840
and just pushing it up a whole other, other notch.

1091
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:57,960
A lot of players are really seeing that these companies are trying to nickel and dime and

1092
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,160
suck the, their user base for every penny that they could possibly get out of them.

1093
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,520
And they've had enough.

1094
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:13,960
And it's, um, it's absolutely just, just disgusting.

1095
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,720
A lot of people are disgusted by it.

1096
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:24,200
Um, there, um, there's people who are saying, you know, well, if they've got this thing

1097
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,080
that's not available in the game, but I have to pay to get it.

1098
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,000
Why isn't it just available in the game?

1099
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,920
Anyway, I've bought this game.

1100
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,160
Why are you making me pay for more things that's already technically in the game?

1101
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:42,680
Um, and I mean, there has been some major blowback.

1102
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:53,160
Um, for example, uh, uh, Sega, um, got a lot of negative, uh, press after they, you know,

1103
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:58,040
had made public, uh, information about their plans to use NFT and crypto.

1104
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:03,480
Um, Ubisoft, um, we, we covered them at the end of the year.

1105
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:09,240
They also were really surprised at how unhappy their customers were.

1106
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:18,920
Um, yeah, there's a, in fact, the, there's a, a couple of, uh, YouTube videos out there

1107
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:24,040
talking about, uh, where, where they had made the announcement that got like 90% dislikes

1108
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,160
from the people that viewed it.

1109
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,600
Um, they're, uh,

1110
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:39,960
they're really, um, some people are thinking that their NFTs, well, the companies are saying

1111
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,680
that their NFTs are not motivated by profit.

1112
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:47,880
For example, uh, Matt Wolf at Zynga, his quote is that it's all about community.

1113
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,840
We believe in giving people the opportunity to play to earn, but no.

1114
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:04,120
The, the thing is about it is that, is that the whole thing is we're, we're not stupid.

1115
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,560
We're not stupid.

1116
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,880
A lot of people are stupid, but we're not.

1117
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,560
I'm, I'm very curious.

1118
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,680
I need to crowdsource or chat source this a bit.

1119
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,200
Is there, because I would be, I would be honestly curious of the perspective.

1120
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,160
Are there any like gaming podcasts or YouTube channels you all listen to that are pro NFT?

1121
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,280
And like, what's the angle.

1122
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:30,920
And I, I mean, things that existed before this that have decided they are pro NFT.

1123
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:37,240
I don't mean a show that started from some crypto folks who are now doing, getting into gaming.

1124
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,680
Cause then I don't want that.

1125
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:44,200
I want somebody who existed before that is pro and continuing with that.

1126
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,760
I would, I would be like, where are they?

1127
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,600
Cause I would like to hear that perspective.

1128
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:54,360
Well, I don't know from any on our level, but there are a couple of companies that are

1129
00:57:54,360 --> 00:58:01,800
against NFTs, uh, valve for one thing, uh, uh, for steam, it prohibits, uh, blockchain

1130
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,600
games that allow cryptocurrencies or entities.

1131
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,080
Thank God.

1132
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,240
Cause how easy would it be to convert that, um, trading card system they have to something

1133
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,120
powered by NFT?

1134
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,440
And maybe that's why they get it.

1135
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:18,520
What's silly though, is like what these companies are trying to do is basically they're trying

1136
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:22,280
to do basically what valve is doing already with some of these trading cards and other

1137
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,080
things.

1138
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:27,640
It's, it's purchases where people can sell and trade stuff that they have.

1139
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,240
It doesn't need blockchain though, to track all that.

1140
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,920
They have a system that just does it.

1141
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,640
It's fine.

1142
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,200
And, and they make person, they make a cut off of every trade, which is kind of what

1143
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,160
the companies want.

1144
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,640
So like, I don't understand why we got to go this NFT route for all this stuff.

1145
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:48,040
Because it, the difference with an NFT is that there, you know, a lot of people are

1146
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:52,280
saying that these are going to be items that are transferable between games or that you

1147
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:58,120
can use this token for your NFT in other franchises by the same companies.

1148
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,600
That's sort of where you're taking out of it.

1149
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,320
That's the point.

1150
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,400
Never, never do that.

1151
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:10,760
Can you imagine if like FIFA, if, if EA decided that FIFA ultimate team stuff, that the players

1152
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,760
would be transferable between different players, do that.

1153
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:20,680
Outfits, items, you know, you would have something from one game that would affect the gameplay

1154
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,000
in another, you know, that's, it'll never happen.

1155
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,360
They'll never implement it that way.

1156
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,720
But, but Jamie's right.

1157
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,440
But Jamie's right.

1158
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,720
That's what they think is going to happen.

1159
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,840
Cause that was that whole talk around pinhead and dead by daylight and all that, which,

1160
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,720
which by the way, suddenly disappeared that chat.

1161
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,960
There's more about that by the way.

1162
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,720
On Thursday, I believe it's going to be five o'clock Pacific time.

1163
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:50,840
There is going to be, I have to find the channel again, but Doug Bradley and, and his wife,

1164
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:55,000
Steph are going to be talking about the recording session for dead by daylight.

1165
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,480
I caught last week's live show and this one looks to be fascinating.

1166
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,920
They usually keep their repeats up.

1167
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,400
They also did one with Robert England, but that one's gone, I think.

1168
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:12,440
But also Doug Bradley is just absolutely fascinating to hear talk outside of his pinhead voice.

1169
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:21,160
But, but back to, back to this, Tim Sweeney, the chief executive of Epic games said, and

1170
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:26,680
this is actually the tweet, we aren't touching NFTs as the whole field is currently tangled

1171
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:33,320
up with an intractable mix of scams, interesting decentralized tech foundations and scams.

1172
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:40,600
Um, although they're still allowing, um, third party developers on their store to allow blockchain.

1173
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:51,080
So I, this is, this is what my thought is going to happen.

1174
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,760
There's, they're going to keep trying.

1175
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,560
They're not admitting defeat yet.

1176
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:03,640
And I think that they're going to have, well, it's like what I said, right at the beginning

1177
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,040
of the show, they're going to have to be deceptive about it.

1178
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,880
Does that make sense?

1179
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,600
Yes.

1180
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:20,520
And they're going to have to put this out in a term that is going to appeal and separate

1181
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:29,000
and separate the concept, or at least the buzzword of NFT from the concept of NFT.

1182
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,560
Um, and I, I just have to call out, have I gone robot?

1183
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,880
Because the thing is we're losing frames.

1184
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,520
Nope.

1185
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,000
Okay.

1186
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,360
Well, you still find in me, let's try to push through.

1187
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:46,360
We're at an, now you are, I was, this is exactly the point that this started last week

1188
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,480
was right an hour into the show.

1189
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,480
Oh, like clockwork.

1190
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,200
Big NFT doesn't want us talking about it.

1191
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,200
So you're doing everything to shut down the system.

1192
01:01:59,160 --> 01:01:59,880
Seriously.

1193
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:01,800
All right.

1194
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,840
Just try to keep powering through for the sake of the podcast listeners.

1195
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,240
I'm going to pray it sorts itself out in the next few minutes.

1196
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,320
It's not too bad right now to me.

1197
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,600
So yeah, it's fine.

1198
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,100
Okay.

1199
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,800
Uh, Loki, why don't you go ahead with your follow-up then?

1200
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:20,440
Oh, speaking of NFTs, uh, Konami who, yeah, I guess they're making games still.

1201
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:27,400
Uh, they decided that, you know, with their NFT 35th anniversary memorial of the Castlevania

1202
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:32,760
series, they went ahead and sold out of those NFTs and made the total of $162,000.

1203
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,160
And this is why these companies are going to keep getting into it because they can

1204
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,360
literally produce something that takes no effort whatsoever.

1205
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,960
It is just an image.

1206
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:51,400
And then they can make $162,000 that's effort for profit is just, it's insane.

1207
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:57,880
Um, so yeah, they sold the highest selling item, I think was actually for 26,000, which

1208
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,360
was a digital map of Dracula's castle.

1209
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:05,080
Um, it's just, that's just nuts.

1210
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,240
So yeah, it's here to stay.

1211
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:15,560
And one also, uh, another person that's gained of teases, none other than voice actor,

1212
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:22,920
Troy Baker, who was partnering with voice verse NFTs to have an NFT, I guess of him

1213
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,720
or his voice.

1214
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,320
I'm not really sure what it is, but nobody likes it.

1215
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,360
I like, I like Troy Baker saying he's my favorite voice in saints row, but like,

1216
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:42,840
Yeah, I don't know what exactly it is that he's trying to get on, except somebody probably

1217
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,320
sat him down and told him how he could make more money.

1218
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:50,120
And, um, you know, I guess, I guess Twitter is sure opening up his eyes real quick though,

1219
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,960
as to why that's a bad idea.

1220
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:59,320
Um, but I, I'm just so disappointed that Konami got rewarded for the whole like Castlevania

1221
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,440
NFTs and that whole thing, because we didn't get around to being able to talk about it

1222
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,480
last week because the internet issues, which by the way, I've got a green light now.

1223
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,760
So maybe it was just a hiccup.

1224
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,760
Let's all hold hands and pray.

1225
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,680
Uh, but I think, I think chat, the live folks of the podcast won't notice anything, but

1226
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:16,280
the live folks have been able to hear us, but they haven't been able to see us.

1227
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:21,000
So that does tell me my upload just got borked enough where the audio is getting through,

1228
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,160
but the video is not, but now it should be everything.

1229
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,600
So it's just crazy.

1230
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,080
Anyway, let's all hold hands and pray.

1231
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:31,560
Um, but meanwhile, the Castlevania thing, like I just, it blows my mind how like you

1232
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:37,480
can say that somebody owns a song as legendary as bloody tears.

1233
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,760
Not in this fucking house.

1234
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,480
You don't, that song belongs to the people.

1235
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,600
That song is art.

1236
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,080
That song should belong to the composer.

1237
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,000
You don't own that song.

1238
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,520
I don't care how much you pay for it.

1239
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:56,840
I don't recognize that in this house, Rob, as a person who has done a lot of graphic

1240
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:04,760
design, when you are contracted to do any kind of work, be it musical, anything like

1241
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:10,760
that for a company, it is automatically a part of your contract that the company owns

1242
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,880
your final work.

1243
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,680
Yeah, I get it.

1244
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:17,080
And that's how like, like BeatMania 2DX is still able to use Naoki songs, even though

1245
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,520
he left the company a long time ago.

1246
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,040
Like, yeah, I, I get it from that standpoint and the whole thing.

1247
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,680
And, and obviously when it comes to those sorts of situations and, and being able to

1248
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:32,280
re-release the games with the music intact and all of that, then yes, great that the

1249
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,000
company owns it.

1250
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,760
But I, like Joe Crypto Bro should keep their hands off that fucking song.

1251
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:46,520
Like, I, I don't, I think the best analogy to NFTs that I saw was the whole, like, you

1252
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:50,840
know, those services where you register a star in the galaxy with your name on it and

1253
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,040
it's in this database, but it's not NASA's database.

1254
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,560
So it doesn't really fucking matter.

1255
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,760
And that is not the actual scientific name of the star.

1256
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:02,840
That's how I feel about all this stuff is that y'all are buying into this database.

1257
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:08,360
And it's just like, okay, Bitcoin was the first crypto coin, but suddenly the first

1258
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,120
major somebody's going to correct me on it.

1259
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,000
If I don't clarify it first major breakthrough crypto coin.

1260
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,680
There's going to be other forms of NFT and this whole stuff.

1261
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:26,600
And it's, it's, it's, it's going to literally fall up its own black hole asshole into this

1262
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:33,400
void of non-existence because the seas will be polluted with all of these people trying

1263
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:38,120
to get in on, on cashing out on receipts and naming rights, which is basically that whole

1264
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:38,520
thing.

1265
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,360
Or better yet when people decide it's not worth anything and then it just devalues itself

1266
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,000
to nothing.

1267
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,240
Yeah.

1268
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,640
It's like Mike Deft brings up this week and fuck Konami.

1269
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,600
You know, what's funny.

1270
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:54,680
I was sent the latest, uh, Jim Stephanie Sterling video on, uh, the fuck Konami and the NFT

1271
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,320
stuff and, and what they had to say about the whole thing.

1272
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,120
I was actually a little disappointed.

1273
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:04,040
I thought the video would have a little more bite than it actually did.

1274
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,760
And that's no disrespect to, uh, Stephanie, who I think, I think they have some great

1275
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:14,120
takes, but, um, I think it's just, they, they've beaten that horse dead, like so much.

1276
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,320
That's why it's like, you know, what, what more is there really to say?

1277
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,240
It's kind of like at this point, they're kind of getting worn down by just the industry

1278
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:21,720
and everything.

1279
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,680
And so I am a big fan of them.

1280
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:30,200
Um, it's just, it's just like, yeah, it's like, well, it's not too shocking because

1281
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:30,840
it's Konami.

1282
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,000
So that, and that's okay.

1283
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,600
Stephanie it's, it's, it's like the last episode of our show.

1284
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,680
We tried, it didn't quite work.

1285
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,400
Okay.

1286
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,680
It's going to happen sometimes.

1287
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,560
It's okay.

1288
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,160
Uh, I'm, I'm still a fan.

1289
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:47,160
Uh, that's, yeah, but it definitely felt like one of those videos where it was like,

1290
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,680
they're only doing this because they feel like they have to, or the fan base is going

1291
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,120
to complain, you know?

1292
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,280
But anyway, all right.

1293
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,960
Uh, let's move on.

1294
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,280
I don't want to talk about NFTs anymore.

1295
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,560
I got no fucking time for those.

1296
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,680
Let's talk about, let's talk about something for some reason you still can't buy, which

1297
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,680
is Final Fantasy 14.

1298
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:14,360
Uh, because Final Fantasy 14 has been continuing to have server issues, but a roadmap was posted

1299
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:18,600
this week that will include resales of the game going back on sale.

1300
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:23,240
So Final Fantasy 14, if you are not on board with the game yet, uh, and you've wanted to

1301
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,520
get in on it because of all the Endwalker hype, because the servers have been having

1302
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,080
so many issues, you can't, you can't do it right now, but as of January 25th, you will

1303
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,600
be able to buy the game again.

1304
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,840
Have you ever heard of a game company pulling a game off a shelf for a month only to put

1305
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,240
it back because the game is too popular?

1306
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,080
This is like I said, 2021 crazy year for games.

1307
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:49,240
Um, so, uh, but now Kiyoshita did point out, or did put out a list of where, so what's

1308
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:54,040
going to change on January 25th, according to this roadmap, the Oceana data server is

1309
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,080
going to open.

1310
01:08:55,080 --> 01:09:00,120
So, um, Australia, New Zealand, and you know, some of the Pacific rim, that whole part of

1311
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,200
the world is going to get their own servers.

1312
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:06,360
So that's going to be people that come off of where those people are playing now, which

1313
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,480
is mostly the Japanese servers for a good chunk of that.

1314
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:13,160
And some of the North American servers, even, because a lot of the Australians want to play

1315
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,320
there, um, or Europe even.

1316
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,800
So it's going to involve a lot of those folks coming off of other data centers to play on

1317
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,840
a dedicated data center.

1318
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:26,840
So they think that's going to be enough, um, to, uh, resale, resell the game again.

1319
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,960
The queue situation is also just talking firsthand.

1320
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,880
It's improved a little bit.

1321
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:36,680
It's still not great in prime time, but I can pretty reliably get on the game in my

1322
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:40,680
usual hours of like eight or nine o'clock at night and not face a huge queue.

1323
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,960
I think what's happened is that now the end Walker's been out for a month.

1324
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,240
The people that wanted to play through the main scenario have done it.

1325
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:52,680
Um, and fantasy 14 has declared the end of spoiler warnings for end Walker.

1326
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,880
So I guess we can openly talk about spoilers for the game now in their eyes.

1327
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,080
I'm not going to do it.

1328
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,520
We did a spoiler cast that's in the VoG network archives here on Twitch.

1329
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,640
If you want to go check it out.

1330
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,560
So I already have that all out of my system.

1331
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,680
So for those of you, cause I think even Jamie said she still wanted to play through it at

1332
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,640
some point, I will not spoil y'all have your chance.

1333
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:15,240
But, um, I think square has basically, you know, taken that approach of, well, all the

1334
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,040
people that really wanted to play it are through the game now.

1335
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:23,000
So, uh, we can probably open it up a little more than, um, they are going to be adding

1336
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,960
more worlds to the North American server and Europe throughout the rest of 2022 and into

1337
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,080
2023.

1338
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,760
The roadmap is really long.

1339
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:35,160
I got to say, it doesn't look like they're really able to address the issues with North

1340
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:38,600
America, which, you know, yes, I'm going to be selfish and only care about that for now

1341
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,400
until August of 2022.

1342
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,040
Four new worlds will go online in August.

1343
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:52,360
That's I mean, I get that there are semiconductor shortages and all that, but damn pull the

1344
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,960
servers for 11 and use them to run for it.

1345
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,840
I'm just kidding.

1346
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,880
Bob has 11 fans.

1347
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,360
Don't hate me.

1348
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,080
Don't hate me.

1349
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,600
But everyone's playing on pirate servers.

1350
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,480
It's never going to happen.

1351
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:11,000
Ziba in chat says the cues on the crystal data center have been double digits.

1352
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:18,920
I will run into the thousand person long queue still on Cactuar because again, I was there

1353
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:25,000
first, but I happened to roll on the server where the very, very, very popular World of

1354
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,560
Warcraft streamer who decided to take up Final Fantasy 14 and rather enjoyed it and

1355
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,640
doesn't talk very favorably of wow anymore.

1356
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,600
And I happen to be on that person's server.

1357
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,480
I was there first.

1358
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,440
Thank you very much.

1359
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,680
And again, I don't want to gatekeep the game.

1360
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,520
I'm thrilled that person is there.

1361
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,120
I'm thrilled the community is there.

1362
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:48,040
I'm hoping that what we're supposed to get before August and that whole cross data center

1363
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:54,920
thing is going to really help ease a lot of that because I know I am more than happy

1364
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,840
to go log into crystal and go play with Ziba for the night.

1365
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:02,200
So I don't have to worry about the cues on Aether.

1366
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,160
And I think that will kind of work itself out at the end of the day.

1367
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,560
So I'm really, really hoping for the data center travel really soon.

1368
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:16,840
It's supposed to still come with, well, they're now saying not 6.1, but the 6.1X series.

1369
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:21,400
So it's going to be a few months still, but hopefully not too far out.

1370
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,320
All right, let's move on.

1371
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,080
Dark Sakura.

1372
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,720
I think this is an interesting trend in the workplace.

1373
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:37,240
Yeah, there are some video game studios who are taking to heart this thing that's been

1374
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:40,920
tried in Japan for several different companies.

1375
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,040
And that's moving people to a four-day work week.

1376
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:50,840
I am going to go and say this, that they're not talking about a four-day work week like

1377
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,840
I have because I work four by 10.

1378
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,960
These are for eight-hour days.

1379
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:02,520
And in fact, one of the companies, Crows, Crows, Crows,

1380
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,160
they actually, they're the group that did the Stanley Parable.

1381
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:14,360
They have rewritten contracts to do the same pay for four days of work instead of five.

1382
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,960
And so far, so good.

1383
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:27,720
Eidos Montreal is actually pushing back against the crunch time hours and everything by trying

1384
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:37,000
to also limit time and making sure that people are able to treat themselves with compassion.

1385
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,680
That's the quote coming back from Pew from Crows, Crows, Crows.

1386
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:52,120
But there has been lots of studies coming on that shows this is actually scientific

1387
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:52,920
research.

1388
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:59,560
In Iceland, there was a trial run by the Reykjavik City Council that included over 2,500 workers,

1389
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,160
which is 1% of the population.

1390
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:09,240
They're saying that the workers felt less stress and at work of burnout because their

1391
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:13,080
work-life balance improved after adopting a shorter working week.

1392
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:17,560
They have more time to spend with their families, do hobbies and complete their household chores.

1393
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:26,600
And their productivity remained the same, even though they had gone down from 40 hours

1394
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,880
to 35 or 36.

1395
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:37,080
The whole thing behind it is that they're saying that it's how the projects are being

1396
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:43,400
managed, that if a project is being managed well, then they should be able to get the

1397
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:58,360
same amount of work done in less time and that a more rested worker, a more, what's

1398
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:05,240
the word I'm thinking of, a more fulfilled worker will work, will be happier and work

1399
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:08,440
better because they're not running on empty.

1400
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:13,480
And I actually find it funny that they were using an example from Japan about this because

1401
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:18,120
over there, it's considered to be a mark of honor if you fall asleep at your job.

1402
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:27,800
But they're really wanting work to be more dignified.

1403
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:38,120
They want it to be something that's going to be where they're working ethically, which

1404
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:43,560
is harder for some of the bigger studios, which is why Eidos Montreal and Eidos Sherbrooke

1405
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:50,840
are considered the biggest leaps in the industry as for taking this role because they are larger

1406
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,400
studios.

1407
01:15:52,280 --> 01:16:00,680
Both of them have done Final Fantasy games, Tomb Raider, because they worked under Square

1408
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,640
Enix for a bit.

1409
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:08,040
And of course, they did Guardians of the Galaxy, which is one of the best games of last year.

1410
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,440
Yeah, I was just going to say Quest Buster just pointed that out in chat and I went,

1411
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:16,440
oh yeah, speaking of 2021 games, that was way better than people thought it would be.

1412
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:27,480
Yeah, and they're really, I mean, in the end, a lot of these companies are really trying

1413
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:32,120
to just be better to their employees and they're getting better results.

1414
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:39,720
And on top of that, one of the former producers at Crows Crows Crows, Alicia, I'm going to

1415
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:49,080
mispronounce her name, contestable, I guess, was implementing the four day work week at

1416
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,320
the studio that she's setting up.

1417
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:57,800
And she's basically saying that because they're implementing that into their work structure,

1418
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,640
they're not losing any time at all.

1419
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,240
She thinks that her employees are going to be more resilient and well rested.

1420
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:08,920
And on top of that, they're also aiming for healthier work culture.

1421
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:16,760
And the quote is that it's one that's fundamentally anti-racist, feminist and LGBTQ plus friendly.

1422
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,240
I'm going to add the A because don't forget the A ever.

1423
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:27,880
And that according to a UK report, moving to a four day workweek can shrink carbon emissions,

1424
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:32,280
reduces the energy used in a workplace and slash transport emissions for morning and evenings.

1425
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:39,400
And then giving an extra day off means that people take part in more low carbon activities,

1426
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,680
including resting, exercising and seeing their family.

1427
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,040
So we'll see.

1428
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:53,720
Right now, I mean, the big thing we have going on is the series of of walkouts and strikes and

1429
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:58,840
companies that have, you know, notoriously mistreating their employees, especially

1430
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,800
their non cisgender white male employees.

1431
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:11,720
I think the work from home situation has also been very interesting, too, because it shows

1432
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,800
most companies are able to do it.

1433
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,880
I get with game design, it can be a little tricky because, you know, the collaboration

1434
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,880
and some of that is a little tricky.

1435
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:24,040
And that's why some games have had, you know, it's like Nintendo, like a lot of their stuff

1436
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:28,040
has been delayed is because, you know, that that transition to work from home has been

1437
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,480
difficult for a lot of people.

1438
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:33,400
But for those where it works and it has worked for many companies and many individuals within

1439
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,960
those companies, I think that's very interesting, like that long term effect it's going to have.

1440
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:38,760
And it's also interesting.

1441
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:43,560
It's having this conversation about what about four day work, which I just realized in the

1442
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,440
scroll bar, I have four hour work weeks.

1443
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:50,280
I meant to put four day work weeks for that, too.

1444
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,880
But yeah, four day work week.

1445
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:58,040
And I need to specify that it doesn't sound like they're wanting people to do four tens.

1446
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:06,760
It sounds like they are working a regular eight hour day, just four days a week.

1447
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:13,560
Now, for me, I'm going to go ahead and this is going to go into a little bit of personal

1448
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,920
information on me.

1449
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,440
I do four tens.

1450
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,240
I do.

1451
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:20,360
I do a four day, 10 hour work week.

1452
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,160
Well, 40 hours, but 10 hours each day.

1453
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:31,800
Now, I also have FMLA, intermittent FMLA, which lets me take off a certain number of

1454
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,800
hours each month.

1455
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,720
I get 40 hours a month off.

1456
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:46,360
And I have noticed that I working an eight hour day, four days a week, because I was

1457
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,760
running that before I did my narcolepsy test.

1458
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:53,320
I actually felt generally better.

1459
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:59,240
I felt like I could face my work day, that I wasn't super burnt by the, excuse me, by

1460
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,120
the end of my day.

1461
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:11,240
So and now I read a few years ago that they were saying that for like people over 35,

1462
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:21,000
that it's better health wise to work like three to four days a week as opposed to a

1463
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,200
full five day week.

1464
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,000
I only glanced at the study.

1465
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:31,000
But thankfully right now, my work is still having us stay at home.

1466
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:38,760
And they're talking about moving to a hybrid schedule, which I plan on taking advantage

1467
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:50,280
of that would be three days in the office and one day not, depending on the day of the

1468
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,080
week, because they want people there on certain days of the week.

1469
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,720
And I honestly think that we should stay at home.

1470
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,480
I think that everybody, if you can work from home, you should stay at home.

1471
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:08,280
If you're in an environment that you feel that you'd be better around people, yes,

1472
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,000
have the option.

1473
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:19,800
But the thing is that pushing people to be as productive with less presence, if that

1474
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,520
makes sense, is better.

1475
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:30,280
Give people the time.

1476
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:30,600
Okay.

1477
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,880
And also, I'll just type it in.

1478
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:34,200
Okay.

1479
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:38,280
As Joe and Matt in our chat says, this kind of goes back to what I said about a happy

1480
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,080
employee.

1481
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,320
I think a lot of companies, oh, it just scrolled off.

1482
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:45,080
I think a lot of companies are doing a lot of experimenting right now with helping employees

1483
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:48,200
mentally by giving folks a proper work-life balance.

1484
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:48,840
I think it's great.

1485
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,640
And we need to find a way to give employees that work-life balance.

1486
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:51,880
Yeah.

1487
01:21:51,880 --> 01:22:00,120
A lot of companies really kind of having to evaluate what that means in this day and age,

1488
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:00,520
for sure.

1489
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:01,720
All right.

1490
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,800
Um, before we lose Loki, let's try to get some more stories out of him.

1491
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:06,680
Loki, what's next?

1492
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,040
Oh, it's fine.

1493
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,560
I'll just connect to my phone when I'm done.

1494
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:10,840
Now we're here.

1495
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,320
Sure.

1496
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,480
So I'll be here the whole show.

1497
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,200
All right.

1498
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,080
That's the attitude.

1499
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:15,580
Yeah.

1500
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:16,840
Yeah.

1501
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:23,400
So, uh, Oprah or the Lego group is actually delaying some of the new Overwatch 2 sets

1502
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:28,840
because, well, Overwatch 2 isn't out and other reasons as well.

1503
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:36,120
So they were originally going to launch in February on the first, but now it's being

1504
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:39,400
pushed back to next year because of the delay of the game.

1505
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:45,800
Also, they're also considering they're reviewing their partnership with Activision Blizzard,

1506
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:51,480
given the concerns about progress being made to address continuing allegations regarding

1507
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:56,440
workplace culture, especially the treatment of female colleagues and creating a diverse

1508
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,640
and inclusive environment.

1509
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,280
So yeah, there's that too.

1510
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:06,040
Um, I didn't know they were going to put out new, I didn't know.

1511
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,800
I didn't know they were putting out, I didn't know they were putting out

1512
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,000
Overwatch 2 stuff either when the game's nowhere near done.

1513
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,480
So that's kind of fascinating, but you know what?

1514
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:20,840
Props to Lego for doing something extremely actionable about the whole situation.

1515
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:26,040
And really, you know, especially with Bobby Kotick still in charge, um, who's, you know,

1516
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,160
ultimately responsible for the work culture that he's created.

1517
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:34,600
Um, I, I think that, uh, this is great that Lego is, well, I mean, the situation fucking

1518
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:39,320
sucks, but what Legos action is really meaningful in this situation.

1519
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:43,960
And, um, uh, yay, Lego for doing something.

1520
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,640
Yeah, definitely.

1521
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:49,720
I mean, um, I didn't know it was coming out.

1522
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,480
Maybe the green purposes is something else.

1523
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,680
It's a pretty cool set.

1524
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,180
Yeah.

1525
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,300
All right.

1526
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:55,280
Okay.

1527
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:59,420
Let's talk about this because a lot of you have been sharing this one on social media

1528
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:04,220
this week, and I do see the humor in it, but, uh, we had some police officers that were

1529
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:05,980
fired and why were they fired?

1530
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:09,580
Uh, because they were playing Pokemon Go on the job.

1531
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:12,380
But when I say they were playing Pokemon Go on the job, I mean, they were like really

1532
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:13,900
playing it on the job.

1533
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:19,180
Um, there was a report this week that two LAPD officers were patrolling a mall in the

1534
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:23,900
Los Angeles area back in 2017, because our legal system is extremely slow.

1535
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:28,220
And of course, Pokemon Go was still every, I mean, a lot of people still play Pokemon

1536
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:28,860
Go today.

1537
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:32,380
Uh, but even back in 2017, there were still many, many people playing it.

1538
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:37,660
Um, and, uh, the control, you know, the people that talk about, Hey, go here.

1539
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,500
Cause there's a call or there's an incident.

1540
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:43,420
Uh, there was a, they were asked to respond to a robbery in progress.

1541
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:51,020
However, the officers instead went to go get a Snorlax at a nearby Pokemon gym, which I

1542
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,180
have no idea where that was maybe at the mall or something.

1543
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:59,260
Uh, apparently the whole thing was recorded because every patrol car has a D I V C S.

1544
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,420
I don't know what that is, but it's a monitoring system.

1545
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,940
So like they know where the cars are at all times.

1546
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:06,460
And so like a GPS thing.

1547
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:06,700
Yeah.

1548
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:13,820
Um, in the court documents, it said officer Mitchell alerted Lozano that Snorlax just

1549
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:18,940
popped up at 46th and Limer after noting that Limer doesn't go all the way to 46.

1550
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,060
Lozano responded.

1551
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:21,340
Oh, you know what I can do?

1552
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:23,900
I'll go down 11th and swing up on Crenshaw.

1553
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:25,660
I know that way I can get to it.

1554
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:31,020
Mitchell suggested a different route and then told Lozano, we've got four minutes after

1555
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,420
Mitchell apparently caught the Snorlax.

1556
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,660
Oh, well, I'm glad this story had a happy ending.

1557
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:41,820
After Mitchell apparently caught the Snorlax exclaiming, got him.

1558
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:48,060
Petitioners agreed to go get the Togetic and drove off when their car stopped.

1559
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,340
Again, the monitoring system recorded Mitchell saying, don't run away.

1560
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,220
Don't run away.

1561
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,260
While Lozano described how he buried it and ultra bald.

1562
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:58,140
Oh, they put in the court report.

1563
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:01,980
B-U-R-I-E-D buried it like in the ground.

1564
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:06,460
I think what he meant to say was buried it like a raspberry.

1565
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,220
Uh, because that makes more sense.

1566
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:12,300
That's really funny that the court documents butchered that English.

1567
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:13,180
It's a fun language.

1568
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:16,540
It's probably just transcribed, you know?

1569
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,060
It is funny.

1570
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:23,420
Lozano described how he buried it and ultra bald the Togetic before announcing got him.

1571
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,580
Eventually, Mitchell explained, holy crap.

1572
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:29,180
Finally, apparently in reference to catching the Togetic.

1573
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:32,300
And he remarked, the guys are going to be so jealous.

1574
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:39,420
The Board of Rights had their own unique perspective on this, saying playing Pokemon Go

1575
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:44,620
showed complete disregard for the community, wasted resources, violated public trust,

1576
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:47,100
and was unprofessional and embarrassing to the department.

1577
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:52,060
They've done a lot of other stuff that's more embarrassing than that.

1578
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:52,620
I know, right?

1579
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,060
Should be embarrassed about.

1580
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:59,340
Behavior reflected gross negligence, cowardice, lack of thoughtfulness, and deceit.

1581
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,140
I know.

1582
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,940
And certainly there have been a lot of takes this week about,

1583
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:06,380
oh, Pokemon goes the thing they're going to get in trouble for.

1584
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:08,700
I get it.

1585
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:09,260
I get it.

1586
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:13,020
But a lot of people have been sharing that story this week.

1587
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:17,820
I can't imagine why, but it is interesting.

1588
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:20,220
I will say this.

1589
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:26,460
The times I've been pulled over by the police, which only actually happened once playing

1590
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:31,820
Ingress, I was so easy, easily able to explain the game because I was like, okay, so, you

1591
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:34,220
know, Pokemon Go, it's like that.

1592
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,140
And now they all know what it is.

1593
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:40,780
I didn't really cross my mind that the police are all playing Pokemon Go, but I guess I

1594
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,660
guess that's that.

1595
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:46,380
S2100, Matt says, we're going to need you to get out of here.

1596
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:50,540
Snorlax wasn't a big deal and go even in 2017.

1597
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,420
It kind of was.

1598
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,420
If you were newer to the game, it still kind of was.

1599
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:58,140
Anyway, all right, let's move on.

1600
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:03,180
Let's go back to a simpler time when the police were policing and not playing video games

1601
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:03,580
on the job.

1602
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,980
But if they were playing video games, they might've been playing this.

1603
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:10,220
Let me play the bumper for the segment and then we'll explain.

1604
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:13,420
No, I think actually we need to explain how it's different first because I don't have

1605
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:13,900
a lot of time.

1606
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,340
I've already talked about it before.

1607
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,940
I know, but you did it on the no show.

1608
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:18,540
You haven't done it on the podcast.

1609
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:21,340
So I didn't let the on the show that didn't last either.

1610
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,900
I thought we didn't get to the segment last week, but I talked about it.

1611
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:26,220
All right.

1612
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:28,860
Anyway, well, let's let's remind people.

1613
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:32,380
We have a 2022 twist this year on the classic game of the week.

1614
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:37,020
So once a month, and finally we're getting to it this month, dark soccer is going to

1615
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,460
pick something different.

1616
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,820
We've done classic soundtracks.

1617
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,420
We've done classic 8-bit games.

1618
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:43,580
We've done classic peripherals.

1619
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:46,060
And for 2022, dark soccer is going to do.

1620
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:50,140
I'm doing classic electronic handheld game.

1621
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:50,780
All right.

1622
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:53,340
So that being said, let's get to the bumper.

1623
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:09,340
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault.

1624
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,620
And pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1625
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:15,260
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1626
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:20,460
And she means, of course, classic electronic handheld.

1627
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,340
This is oops.

1628
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,980
And of course, the wrong screen is up.

1629
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,020
Go me.

1630
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,740
Let's try flipping that around a little bit.

1631
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:31,900
And gosh, darn it.

1632
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:33,820
The tab accidentally closed.

1633
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:34,220
That's all right.

1634
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:37,340
Let me go back to the main show shots and dark soccer.

1635
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:40,860
Why don't you start talking about this and I will get in.

1636
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:41,900
I'll get the footage up.

1637
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:42,400
Sorry.

1638
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:48,620
The game is the Tomy handheld Tron game.

1639
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:49,420
That's the first one.

1640
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,260
It came out in 1982.

1641
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,580
It is one of three different games.

1642
01:29:56,940 --> 01:30:00,940
It contains, sorry, three games that were based on different action sequences in Tron.

1643
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:05,500
In the first one, you are playing a light cycle game around the game grid and you got

1644
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,820
to cut off the other drivers.

1645
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:14,220
The second one, Tron versus Sark, throw discs at each other, kind of like Pong.

1646
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:18,620
So, you know, but it's the whole ring fighting game.

1647
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:24,540
And then the last one, you have to throw your disc into the heart of the MCP to destroy

1648
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:25,040
it.

1649
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:31,100
Once it's done, then you start over faster with a higher level of difficulty.

1650
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:36,220
Um, and this thing, it definitely looks very 80s.

1651
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:41,820
You know, it's the whole sort of square boxy shape, you know, with big button and everything

1652
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:42,780
a switch in the middle.

1653
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:51,580
Um, it's, it's actually, I mean, keep in mind, this is, this was top notch when, when I was

1654
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:52,080
six.

1655
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:57,740
So, uh, this is still top notch at me being 43.

1656
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:58,300
Are you kidding?

1657
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:59,020
This looks rad.

1658
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:06,140
Well, and it was called, um, they were called the, the TomyTronic, um, electric games.

1659
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:10,540
They also did like, they had a scramble was one of them.

1660
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:15,100
There was a Pac-Man that was circular, like a disc.

1661
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:19,740
And it was one of the, uh, TomyTronic ones.

1662
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:24,380
You know, they, they did a bunch of different ones like that, but I brought up the Tron

1663
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:27,660
one in particular because we love Tron here.

1664
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:28,700
We love Tron here.

1665
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,740
We, we love Tron in this house.

1666
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:36,380
And I thought that this one would be a neat one, you know?

1667
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:41,100
Um, and it is, it is pretty, pretty cool.

1668
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:48,620
You know, you have the different light colors on the screen and it was all just, it was,

1669
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:51,260
it was pretty, pretty tops when, when it came out.

1670
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,860
And on top of that, the box was cool.

1671
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:57,580
Just that big old Tron logo on it.

1672
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:05,180
Of course, um, we, uh, there was one that was released, of course.

1673
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:07,900
Uh, there was a Japanese one, there was a US one.

1674
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:12,380
Um, they, you know, they had their own little manuals and everything.

1675
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:13,740
They were pretty cool.

1676
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:18,380
Of course, our manuals were in black and white and the Japanese ones had pink accents on

1677
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:21,340
them, but that's it.

1678
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:24,700
Not a lot to talk about.

1679
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:26,940
Okay.

1680
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:27,260
Sorry.

1681
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:31,980
I, you caught me running back in the room from a potty break, but I was watching the

1682
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:35,180
B-roll earlier and it, this is like a machine I want to get my hands on.

1683
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:37,100
How did you, and I'm sorry if I missed it.

1684
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,820
How did you find, or how did you know of this?

1685
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:41,340
Did you have a friend that had one or something?

1686
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:49,340
I had the TomyTronic, uh, Pac-Man when I was a kid.

1687
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:50,940
Gotcha.

1688
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:55,260
But I knew about the Tron one cause I had been on this big, like Tron kick.

1689
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,580
So I knew about it.

1690
01:32:58,460 --> 01:32:58,960
Gotcha.

1691
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:02,780
Uh, looking at some comments in chat, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, I would have totally

1692
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:04,780
gotten this if I saw it as a kid.

1693
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:07,420
Uh, you were a kid, you didn't have your own money, Matt.

1694
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:08,540
That's all right.

1695
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:15,260
You would ask Santa for, or, uh, like I think I had one like a few years after, after it

1696
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:17,980
came out, like at a, from like a thrift store or something.

1697
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:19,980
Um, Ziba in chat.

1698
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:25,260
There was also like alien attack, which was also a neat one.

1699
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:27,420
Uh, Ziba in chat says, this is interesting.

1700
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:27,740
Yeah.

1701
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:30,860
And a lot of folks in chat saying, wow, I never heard of this, but this looks really

1702
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:31,500
cool.

1703
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:37,020
Well, this might be a theme that is repeated throughout the year 2022 as dark soccer gets

1704
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:40,060
into the classic electronic handhelds of the week.

1705
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:45,020
Cause I imagine, you know, most of our listeners, I know the hosts of the show are pretty much

1706
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:47,740
in their forties at this point, but a lot of the listeners, I think are more in their

1707
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:48,940
twenties and thirties.

1708
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:52,860
So, um, literally a lot of machines that came out before you were born.

1709
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:57,980
Um, and even for us, like we were young kids when these types of machines are out.

1710
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:00,860
So, um, I think there's going to be a lot of eBay listing.

1711
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:02,860
How much do they want for these on eBay?

1712
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:07,740
Uh, one of the mid range ones is 180 bucks.

1713
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:09,100
Jesus.

1714
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:14,540
And I'll link it in chat so that people can see, uh, some of the pictures on it.

1715
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:20,220
But, um, but it's, it's, you know, it's a neat way to see what it looked like all sides

1716
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:21,180
of it and everything.

1717
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:22,700
It's, it's, it's pretty cool.

1718
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:23,660
All right.

1719
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:24,860
Well, there it is.

1720
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:28,060
Your classic electronic handheld of the week.

1721
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:28,700
Very cool.

1722
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:29,100
Love it.

1723
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:30,140
All right.

1724
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:35,660
Let us now go around and do some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines

1725
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:38,220
happening amongst the game real quickly.

1726
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:42,780
Bobby Black with a chat says, I mean, some of us spend $800 on replica cabinets.

1727
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:46,140
So $180 for something like this is what I expected.

1728
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:47,740
$800.

1729
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:50,700
Bobby, are we not going to talk about the rush table?

1730
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:52,940
Cause we should talk about the rush table.

1731
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:56,380
Are we not going to talk about everything that's in my house?

1732
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:58,220
Exactly.

1733
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:03,740
Which while Bobby starting his own little, he's starting the, uh, uh, East coast version

1734
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:07,100
of that, uh, in the, in Bobby Bay, Bobby theater at Bobby Manor.

1735
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:08,300
So, all right.

1736
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:10,700
All right.

1737
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,420
Moving on, let's get to some rapid fire news.

1738
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:13,920
Loki.

1739
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:15,340
All right.

1740
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:21,980
So apparently we just found out that the Xbox one was, uh, they stopped production on it

1741
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:22,860
a couple of years ago.

1742
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:31,820
So apparently, um, we just found out that the Xbox one S, uh, was stopped in production

1743
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:34,460
at the end of 2020.

1744
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:44,220
And that the Xbox one X, um, apparently, well, that was stopped in, I guess, uh, July of

1745
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:45,500
2020.

1746
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:51,820
So now we know, not that it makes a difference.

1747
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:55,900
That was the wildest headline, you know, for them to come out and just be like, Oh, by

1748
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:58,140
the way, the Xbox one is done.

1749
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:02,540
Like I can't, I actually kind of admire them for being able to kind of like stealthily

1750
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:05,020
do that so that people would miss it.

1751
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:09,420
Because, you know, if they came out and said, we're going to be ending the Xbox one in two

1752
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:13,900
months, everyone would have said, Oh, I'll never be able to get one.

1753
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:18,780
And you know, there would have been just ends for them to, it's such a, yeah, it's not such

1754
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:21,420
a big deal since everything's kind of backwards compatible anyways.

1755
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:27,020
So yeah, it's, it's very, uh, bold of them to be like, we got rid of this months ago

1756
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:28,220
and none of you noticed.

1757
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:35,500
So moving on as very, uh, very gaslight gatekeep girl boss, uh, on Microsoft part.

1758
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:35,820
Yes.

1759
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:42,300
So, and then of course, um, following up, going back to our predictions for the air

1760
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:49,180
and house, uh, you know, CEOs of these corporate giants that is make way too much

1761
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:49,660
money.

1762
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:52,300
And a lot of times they're really toxic people.

1763
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:56,220
Well, now we have a list of those toxic people and the money that they made.

1764
01:36:56,220 --> 01:37:01,180
So, uh, you know, Bobby, Bobby Kotick made $154 million.

1765
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:07,900
Um, we have, uh, Andrew Wilson made $34 million.

1766
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:10,300
And then what else?

1767
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:13,180
Strauss Zelnick, only $18 million.

1768
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:15,260
Man has the money there.

1769
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:24,460
I know, uh, the top earner for 2020 was actually Robert, uh, and tookle with a play

1770
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:25,020
dig, huh?

1771
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:27,500
Never heard of them, but $372 million.

1772
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:36,620
And then we also had folks, uh, Andrew paradise from skills and John Riccatello from unity

1773
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:39,820
on the list, NC soft razor and team seven.

1774
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,860
I know none of these names except for John Riccatello.

1775
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:44,300
I've heard that one, but none of the, yeah.

1776
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:45,100
Oh my God.

1777
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:45,660
Wow.

1778
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:52,700
Um, and then the very bottom lease out of the 42, uh, was Lars wing of her, uh, which

1779
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,660
was an bracer group of $162,000.

1780
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:00,780
So just every time that they tell you that they need to raise prices of the games, because

1781
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:03,820
they're just not making enough money to pay for these games.

1782
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:08,060
Maybe they could tap into some of that money that these CEOs are making, because I think

1783
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:12,140
$154 million probably goes a long way when it comes to game development.

1784
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:15,740
Just a thought, you know, you could live off of the interest.

1785
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:17,660
Yeah.

1786
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:20,940
That much money would probably pay their developers a little bit more money.

1787
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:24,460
You know, so fun.

1788
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,820
Don't expect it to get any better, only worse.

1789
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:29,660
All right.

1790
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:30,220
Dark soccer.

1791
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:30,860
What do you have for us?

1792
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:35,580
So, um, a game I love cotton.

1793
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:41,100
The cotton Sega, uh, Saturn classics are going to be coming on to PC before too long.

1794
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:48,540
That includes a cotton to cotton boomerang and a guardian force, uh, cotton guardian force.

1795
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:52,540
Um, they are beautiful remastered games.

1796
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:59,340
The, uh, PS4 and Nintendo switch version, um, uh, were criticized because of input delay

1797
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:00,220
issues.

1798
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:05,820
And so it looks like there's going to be some, uh, patching done before the release and it

1799
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:06,700
should be coming out.

1800
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:11,900
And there's also going to be a new sequel cotton rock and roll is being developed to

1801
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:12,860
come out later this year.

1802
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:19,420
And then also the official logo for the street fighter 35th anniversary is out.

1803
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:25,820
Um, and it will be celebrating its 30, 35th anniversary on August 12th.

1804
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:30,540
And they have teased things about the future of the series will be announced.

1805
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:36,060
So whatever the hell that is street fighter, although we do know there's final DLC.

1806
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:41,580
Uh, the, uh, character Luke will have an important role.

1807
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:43,440
Hmm.

1808
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:45,180
All right.

1809
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,020
All right.

1810
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:49,500
Let's travel around the, I'm sorry, I'm having internet issues again.

1811
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,860
So sorry if I'm going robot on you guys, but, uh, let's travel around the world and check

1812
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:56,220
out some release dates, uh, around the world, starting with the U S Loki.

1813
01:39:57,020 --> 01:40:00,940
Uh, we have shadow man remastered on Nintendo switch.

1814
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:07,740
Uh, nobody saves the world on PC, Xbox one, which is dead, uh, Xbox series X.

1815
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:12,220
We have the RP RP golf legends.

1816
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:15,660
Uh, I guess that's, it's a role-playing golf game.

1817
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:16,300
Awesome.

1818
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:22,460
Uh, that's on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, Tom Clancy's rainbow

1819
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:28,540
six extraction on PC PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X and Stadia,

1820
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:35,980
uh, wind jammers two on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one and Stadia.

1821
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:38,940
And last but not least mouse craft on Xbox one.

1822
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:41,100
All right.

1823
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,060
I know I'm a little robot, but in the recording, I'll sound fine.

1824
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:45,900
So I'm going to push through for Japan.

1825
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:51,500
Uh, the Nintendo switch we'll be seeing, uh, the RP golf legends, uh, is actually releasing

1826
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:51,900
over there.

1827
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:55,180
It's an English version, but it is getting a Japanese retail release this week on the

1828
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:56,300
20th for the switch.

1829
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,220
And then a game called lucky dog.

1830
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:01,980
One is the only really other release on the switch this week in Japan.

1831
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:07,260
Taking a look though at the PlayStation five, we have Tom Clancy's rainbow six extraction

1832
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:09,180
it's a worldwide, including Japan.

1833
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:14,300
So they're getting it as well this week and that's really it for the Japanese releases.

1834
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:17,020
So let's check in with dark Sakura and the UK.

1835
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:25,820
Um, we have on the 18th, we have surviving the aftermath on the 20th, we have rainbow

1836
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:26,780
six extraction.

1837
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:31,580
Um, we have expeditions Rome on the 21st.

1838
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:33,100
We have never song.

1839
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:38,700
We also have black wind and the dungeon of nay Hal book, I guess.

1840
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:42,380
I guess that's how it's pronounced.

1841
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:43,680
Sure.

1842
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:45,840
That's it.

1843
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:47,260
All right.

1844
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:49,100
Let's get into some more news.

1845
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:49,600
Loki.

1846
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:51,340
All right.

1847
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:54,700
So Sony's making more PlayStations.

1848
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:55,820
Isn't that exciting?

1849
01:41:56,780 --> 01:42:01,820
They just have a four in front of them or after them, not the fives.

1850
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:05,500
So apparently since, you know, Hey, the fives are pretty hard to get, uh, we're going to

1851
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,860
put out more PlayStation fours.

1852
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:14,380
Not exactly what people are looking for, but something, I guess I see what you did there

1853
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:15,500
looking for.

1854
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:18,640
Yeah.

1855
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,540
So cool.

1856
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:24,460
I don't think it's been hard to get a PlayStation four though.

1857
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:31,740
So I, I think for some reason they think that this is going to keep people within the Sony

1858
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:33,340
brand or something like that.

1859
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:37,340
Or maybe they're going to try to leverage more cloud stuff, or it's just the fact that

1860
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:42,940
the new exclusives for now are still, as far as I know, PlayStation four and PlayStation

1861
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:44,700
five, if I remember right.

1862
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:49,980
Um, you know, things like horizon forbidden West is going to play on a PlayStation four.

1863
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:52,940
So I guess, I mean,

1864
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:56,540
so that's good for the short term.

1865
01:42:56,540 --> 01:43:00,300
I would just wait, honestly, though, if you're really looking for a PlayStation five, I think

1866
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:04,700
a lot of people that are looking for a PlayStation five probably already have a PlayStation four.

1867
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:11,340
So, uh, whatever, you know, it'd be ironic as if scalpers also were scalping these just,

1868
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:16,700
you know, just to show them just because they can just for the pure spite factor.

1869
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:18,460
I hate it.

1870
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:22,380
Um, what about, um, can I, can I ask you real quick?

1871
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:23,660
Um, hopefully I'm coming through.

1872
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:23,980
Okay.

1873
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:28,860
Audio wise on your end, but, um, the, um, we didn't quite get to it in the show world

1874
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:32,220
tonight, but I've definitely seen the rumors and maybe that's why we didn't show it because

1875
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:37,420
more rumors, uh, about the PlayStation three stuff on PlayStation five.

1876
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:41,820
Um, I guess there was a listing in a store somewhere that, or like the PlayStation store

1877
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:44,060
had a PS three game in it for a hot minute.

1878
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,380
And this has a lot of people speculating.

1879
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:48,540
Um, what do you think of that?

1880
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:52,940
That may be backwards compatibility is finally something that Sony is going to be

1881
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:57,980
They'll, they'll just be resold games just like they did at the PlayStation two.

1882
01:43:57,980 --> 01:44:01,180
So digital, digital only and not running off your old disks.

1883
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:02,060
Right.

1884
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:02,220
Yeah.

1885
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:07,500
Cause it'll be even, I think it'll even be like, even if you own a copy of that on the

1886
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:11,180
PlayStation three or whatever, that you wouldn't be able to play it because it'd be like a

1887
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:12,540
remaster or something like that.

1888
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:16,220
I don't remember if that's exactly how, I mean, obviously that would be how it had the

1889
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:17,660
work on the PlayStation two.

1890
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:23,020
Cause they didn't have a digital storefront for PlayStation two, um, for the PlayStation

1891
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:29,820
two, but, uh, for the PlayStation three, I would hope that like, if I own the game digitally

1892
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:32,860
that I could just play it digitally.

1893
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:37,340
But if they're going to sell it to you again, I'm sure that they're going to want that

1894
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:38,860
opportunity to sell to you again.

1895
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:43,980
That would be incredibly shitty if like my digital library didn't roll over company that

1896
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:46,620
also charges $70 for their games.

1897
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:47,900
So yeah, I know.

1898
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:55,020
Um, I I'm curious though, too, cause a lot of folks are noticing that the PlayStation

1899
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:57,580
now prepaid cards are starting to disappear.

1900
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:59,740
I guess that's been a whole thing as well.

1901
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:05,740
And folks are thinking that this, well, folks are thinking that this rumored PlayStation

1902
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:09,020
plus and cloud gaming getting rolled into that.

1903
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:12,380
And that whole thing may be all coming to a head here.

1904
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:16,140
Um, that all of this is kind of together.

1905
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:18,940
Like it's not a coincidence that this is all happening at once.

1906
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:20,620
And that may be the PlayStation three stuff.

1907
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:22,380
Is it all going to be cloud stuff?

1908
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:25,260
Cool.

1909
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:27,340
I, yeah, I don't know.

1910
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:29,900
Like, isn't that already cloud stuff now?

1911
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:33,420
I mean, like, it's just, I just don't want PlayStation now.

1912
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:33,900
Period.

1913
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:38,460
Like if, if like they had the, uh, I don't even know if they have the option of like

1914
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:39,100
download stuff.

1915
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:40,540
It's just, that's not interesting to me.

1916
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:43,100
I have a ton of games on the PlayStation.

1917
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:46,860
I just, I don't play PlayStation anymore.

1918
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:49,900
I don't want it either, especially with my shitty internet these days.

1919
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:51,100
Yeah, exactly.

1920
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:54,620
Like, like it's like, Oh, but you can, you can stream it.

1921
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:55,260
Okay, cool.

1922
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:57,340
Don't want to do that though.

1923
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:59,900
Like I'd rather just play the disc I have or something.

1924
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:00,140
Leo.

1925
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:03,660
It's like, I don't, whatever.

1926
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:04,140
That's fine.

1927
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:05,260
All right.

1928
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:10,380
I thought this was an interesting thing that kind of, uh, crossed my desk.

1929
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:13,900
This week is one of those things that dark Tetsuya put down in front of my eyes and was

1930
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:14,620
like, look at this.

1931
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:15,820
Cause this is interesting.

1932
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:16,460
And I agree.

1933
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:19,260
This is an article that a vice was running.

1934
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:20,620
Uh, and I thought this was neat.

1935
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:27,900
Uh, apparently the y'all know, I'm sure anybody that is around our age knows of the epic NES

1936
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:28,860
emulator.

1937
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:32,780
Nesticle was the name of it, which is a little bit dirty, but that was the point.

1938
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:35,820
And there was also a followup emulator of sorts.

1939
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:38,780
There was Genesis that would play the Genesis games.

1940
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:39,260
Right.

1941
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:43,660
And the big deal about those emulators is that they were really the first bit.

1942
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:48,460
They weren't the first emulators, but they were the first to do it so well on a lower

1943
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:50,860
end computer that these, these.

1944
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:52,860
Emulators really caught fire.

1945
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:59,180
And, uh, I can tell you like those that my college years, those were huge and instrumental

1946
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:00,060
about those years.

1947
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:07,260
And there never was really a super Nesticle or SNES, which obviously kind of became the

1948
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:09,260
next thing that got emulated after the Genesis.

1949
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:12,140
And I remember, I think the big ones back in the day were like ZSNES.

1950
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:15,660
And I think there was another one, but we never really saw what the maker, cause it

1951
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:18,140
was one guy that did Nesticle.

1952
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:21,260
He might've had help or whatever, but it was basically all credited to one guy, Sardu,

1953
01:47:21,260 --> 01:47:22,140
that did this.

1954
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:28,220
And, and I remember asking this question on a episode in the past, but that guy ended

1955
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:29,500
up going to work for EA.

1956
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:34,300
Sardu went to work for EA and he ended up working on sports titles.

1957
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:41,340
And there's a big aha moment with all this because apparently what happened is that there

1958
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:47,500
was an Easter egg in a GameCube game that would run Super Punch-Out.

1959
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:51,820
So, uh, the GameCube game was Fight Night round two.

1960
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:55,260
And in this Easter egg, you could actually play Super Punch-Out.

1961
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:59,980
Well, somebody through looking through the code found out that that whole thing was running

1962
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:05,180
on SNES-ticle, Super Nesticle, basically.

1963
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:12,540
So his original vision or whatever for, for what Super Nesticle was going to be, it was

1964
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:14,380
essentially bought by EA.

1965
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:17,900
Kind of going back to that whole comment Dark Soccer said earlier about when you do something

1966
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:19,420
for a company, the company now owns it.

1967
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:19,980
That's big.

1968
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:24,780
So EA bought themselves some SNES-ticles basically to use as this.

1969
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:28,620
Now, obviously retro programming is not the only thing that the author is, you know, I'm

1970
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:31,180
sure doing at this point, but it is very interesting.

1971
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:32,380
Now, why is this relevant?

1972
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:35,740
We're talking about an old ass GameCube game in the Super Nesticle.

1973
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:39,180
Well, for one, I think a lot of people would be interested, like whatever happened to that,

1974
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,980
you know, that guy and his emulators and things like that.

1975
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:50,540
But what happened, a Swedish programmer recently, Johannes Holmberg, took this knowledge and

1976
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:57,820
basically reverse engineered Fight Night Round 2 to isolate that emulator.

1977
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:01,020
And it was only used to play Super Punch-Out.

1978
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:02,780
So who knew if it could run anything else?

1979
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:05,900
But it's now on GitHub.

1980
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:11,580
There's a Python script on GitHub called the SNES-ticle Liberation Project, which you can

1981
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:17,980
find the URLs kind of long, but maybe somebody, if you can even hear me in chat right now,

1982
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:18,700
can link that.

1983
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:23,500
But yeah, it's basically a disk image file that will run SNES-ticle.

1984
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:26,620
And apparently most Super Nintendo games do run.

1985
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:33,180
Of course, they have to do more testing and there's even Mode 7 effects in it.

1986
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:37,020
And it's pointed out Super Punch-Out didn't really use those, but there are issues.

1987
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:41,340
Some of the controller mapping is a little wild and there is no two player support.

1988
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:44,620
So there's better Super Nintendo emulators out there.

1989
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:50,860
But I think this is very interesting because Sardu's particular emulators were such a huge

1990
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:54,300
part of the history of emulators when all is said and done.

1991
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:58,860
I think this particular piece of work was very interesting to a lot of people.

1992
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:03,980
And I don't know if you think about it, the author of this thing.

1993
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:06,940
The guy that made Nesticle is probably like 40 or 50 now.

1994
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:11,020
So who knows how much he wants to be remembered for this type of stuff.

1995
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:13,900
But I just think it's very interesting.

1996
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:14,460
I really do.

1997
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:17,820
So yeah, looking in chat.

1998
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:20,060
Oh, the other Super Nintendo emulator, I couldn't remember.

1999
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:22,460
SNES 9X.

2000
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:23,180
That was the other one.

2001
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:25,020
They were kind of two that were big at the time.

2002
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:26,860
Yeah, good call out, you guys.

2003
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:28,780
That was always the one I used was SNES 9X.

2004
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:29,420
Yeah, yeah.

2005
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:32,620
One of them would do like internet multiplayer, but it really wasn't good.

2006
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:36,380
But I remember playing, I think I finally played through something like Secret of Evermore

2007
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:37,180
on one of those emulators.

2008
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:38,780
It was like Beast Nest as well.

2009
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:40,380
I mean, there was some of the Mac ones too.

2010
01:50:40,380 --> 01:50:43,500
Like right now, I'm actually, I'm trying out Openemu.

2011
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:45,040
Yeah.

2012
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:48,380
It's just supposed to be like multi machine emulation.

2013
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:51,980
Dr. Tsuya in chat says, I just thought it was a really cool story.

2014
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:55,180
I remember hearing about SNESicle and the hidden Super Punch-Out.

2015
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:58,860
Yeah, I think it's fascinating because, and especially because like, again, those were

2016
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:01,660
my college years were playing the shit out of those emulators.

2017
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:07,820
And I know it's an illegal gray area, but being able to keep that at the forefront of

2018
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:13,580
my mind, enabled me to buy these retro collections all these years later and actually sign up

2019
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:18,460
for the Nintendo Switch online and spend way more than I'd care to admit on virtual console.

2020
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:21,020
It's almost as if you legally put the emulators out.

2021
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:23,100
A lot of times people will take advantage of it.

2022
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:23,740
That's for sure.

2023
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:28,940
Fifth Dream in chat says he just worked at EA back then, so he may have just stuck it

2024
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:30,220
in and now it's EA's.

2025
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:31,980
I doubt he just stuck it in.

2026
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:37,180
I don't think you do that when you're a new guy, you know, working on a game like that.

2027
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:40,300
I think they knew he built emulators.

2028
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:43,340
They had the rights to do this particular thing.

2029
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:44,540
They wanted it done well.

2030
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:47,900
And I think they used, I think they basically bought this guy's code to do it.

2031
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:50,380
So, interesting.

2032
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:51,820
All right.

2033
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:53,980
Anyhow, let's move on.

2034
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:54,700
Dark Sakura.

2035
01:51:56,300 --> 01:52:04,140
So, and I actually, I had posted this on my Twitter not long ago, but SNK versus Capcom

2036
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,700
Card Fighters Clash is on the Switch now.

2037
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:07,580
You can just go get it.

2038
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:10,780
It is a port of the Neo Geo Pocket Color game.

2039
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:13,900
And it's $7.99.

2040
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:15,180
You can get it in the eShop.

2041
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:19,500
It's got characters all over both companies' history.

2042
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:22,300
And it was really popular and really fun.

2043
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:23,420
We've got the originals.

2044
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:27,740
We were totally into playing a bunch of that, remember?

2045
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:28,140
Yeah.

2046
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:32,220
And I was, but this was, this was part of why I thought like this is very much like

2047
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:33,900
a Jamie alert for this week.

2048
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:37,660
And I know a lot of people were pleasantly surprised by the release of this on the Switch

2049
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:39,340
because it really did kind of come out of nowhere.

2050
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:41,980
Yeah.

2051
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:45,580
Well, I saw a post about it.

2052
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:46,940
I reposted it.

2053
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:52,460
I haven't gotten it yet, but I mean, it's definitely, I don't know.

2054
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:57,180
It's kind of one of those things that's like, I've got the original and I'm kind of don't

2055
01:52:57,180 --> 01:53:00,620
want to go back and play it, but I know a lot of people do and a lot of people missed

2056
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:00,700
it.

2057
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:01,180
So it's great.

2058
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:01,820
It's a great one.

2059
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:05,500
All right.

2060
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,500
Especially because it has last blade characters in it.

2061
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:08,220
That makes me happy.

2062
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:13,580
So just quickly going back to the last story, because I'm pretty impressed with what Bobby

2063
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:16,780
Black Wolf is doing with his research here on Sardu and where he's been.

2064
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:23,500
Apparently Bobby found the LinkedIn profile and he works at Tiburon in Orlando.

2065
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:24,620
So he works on Madden.

2066
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:26,540
So that's all on the public LinkedIn profile.

2067
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:32,380
And on the age portion, he graduated high school in 94, which if I remember correct

2068
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:33,020
was the same year.

2069
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:34,140
Yeah.

2070
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:35,740
So he's exactly your age.

2071
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:38,060
So that's what am I doing with my life?

2072
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:41,020
Well, a lot, a lot.

2073
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:43,020
You've done a podcast for 20 years.

2074
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:43,900
Where's your emulator?

2075
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:46,140
I'll emulate.

2076
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:49,420
That's still, you know what though?

2077
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:53,580
But the fact that, you know, the fact that he wrote an emulator then at a relatively

2078
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:57,420
young age, so he did that in college and it was better than anything else.

2079
01:53:57,420 --> 01:54:01,660
It was so good that other game companies wanted to buy that talent.

2080
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:03,900
That's very impressive.

2081
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:08,860
I hope he's making buku bucks at EA and, and that's the, that's the person that should

2082
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:10,700
be on the highest paid list.

2083
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,060
Not these fucking CEOs.

2084
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:13,980
Seriously.

2085
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:15,260
All right.

2086
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:21,500
Anyway, uh, Loki, speaking of people that should get paid, uh, people that, um, clean

2087
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,820
the internet of garbage should definitely get paid, right?

2088
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:25,180
Right.

2089
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:26,220
Yes, exactly.

2090
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:34,620
So apparently Twitch has purged over 15 million hate raid bots, uh, as of last year, um, to

2091
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:36,620
which I have the follow-up question.

2092
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:40,220
How were there 15 million hate raid bots on Twitch?

2093
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:45,020
They weren't doing, uh, account verification at the time.

2094
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:50,300
And since they brought in the account verification, it's taking quite a bit for, uh, some of

2095
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:52,140
these bot accounts to get around it now.

2096
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:55,020
They're so, have you ever looked at the viewer list when you're streaming though?

2097
01:54:55,020 --> 01:55:00,780
I have so many bots that hang out in my channel and for the most viewers are just lurkers.

2098
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:01,580
They're there.

2099
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:06,540
They're neither it's, I believe, you know, somebody feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

2100
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:14,620
I believe that because Twitch's chat system is essentially a customized version of IRC,

2101
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:16,460
which we used to use back in the day.

2102
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:17,820
Right back in the day.

2103
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:17,980
Yeah.

2104
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:19,500
Which actually really wasn't that long ago.

2105
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:25,260
If you think about it, we've only been on Twitch since like 2018, but, um, IRC, basically

2106
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:27,580
Twitch is running off a customized version of that.

2107
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:32,860
So I think a lot of these bots, and I think like Nightbot kind of leverages that a little

2108
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:33,100
bit.

2109
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:37,820
It doesn't really watch your channel, but it's leveraging those IRC skeleton portions

2110
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:40,220
to, uh, respond to commands in this case.

2111
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:49,180
But you have all these other bots that are lurking, to which suddenly lurkers are speaking

2112
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:52,060
up and chat rep cycled says, uh, I'm real.

2113
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:52,700
I promise.

2114
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:53,980
All right.

2115
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:57,820
No, I luckily I've seen your name before, so I know you're real, but I'm talking about

2116
01:55:57,820 --> 01:56:00,940
in my personal stream, it'll say I have two viewers.

2117
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:04,220
And then I look at the list of who's in the channel and there's all these bots and you

2118
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:05,420
can tell their bot names.

2119
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:07,740
And I'm like, do I ban them?

2120
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:09,020
Cause they seem harmless.

2121
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:12,860
Like I just would like to know what data they're collecting.

2122
01:56:13,660 --> 01:56:15,980
Some, some of them are analytic bots.

2123
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:17,980
Some of them do belong to Twitch.

2124
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:18,380
Yeah.

2125
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:22,300
I'm fine with analytics and data and just curious Kathy's.

2126
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:23,500
I'm fine with all that.

2127
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:26,860
I, you know, it's obviously it's the haters that can go away.

2128
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:31,580
Like right now I have a bunch of people that are left in here from when I did my marathon

2129
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:33,260
who haven't left.

2130
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:34,540
Yeah.

2131
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:40,940
But like I have things like meta view, you know, just different trying to, you know,

2132
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:43,740
another TT, another TTV viewer.

2133
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:44,460
I've seen that one.

2134
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:47,740
So, so these are all just analytic.

2135
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:49,020
Some of them are analytic ones.

2136
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:55,180
Some of them are legit people, you know, uh, actually, you know, friends, you can click

2137
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:56,540
on, on the name.

2138
01:56:56,540 --> 01:57:01,420
Like I'm clicking on just a bunch of names in a row and these are like actual people.

2139
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:05,660
Although my favorite one right now is broke my stream deck.

2140
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:10,140
Uh, and, and lurkers, you can feel free to lurk.

2141
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:11,980
I, I do not mind a lurker.

2142
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:13,420
I lurk in a lot of channels.

2143
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:14,700
I lurk in dark soccer's channel.

2144
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:15,980
Cause I like to watch on my Xbox.

2145
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:18,220
I saw you in there too.

2146
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:18,620
Yeah.

2147
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:19,260
Still lurking.

2148
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:29,500
I, I am fully down to, uh, to, um, what's the word I'm thinking of?

2149
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:32,700
To, to let people, you know, hang out and lurk.

2150
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:34,060
I'll, I'll leave names in there.

2151
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:39,260
It's the moment that they start actually saying something that's harmful to my community.

2152
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:39,760
Oh, yeah.

2153
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:40,700
Barf.

2154
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:40,940
Yeah.

2155
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:44,700
Then, then, no, I'm not, um, I'm, I'm not down for that.

2156
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:46,700
I'm gonna ban them.

2157
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:51,740
There were also, um, I was using this tool that, that bourbon linked a while back.

2158
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:58,540
Um, who, uh, another awesome, uh, DBD and a new world streamer.

2159
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:05,660
Um, there was a tool that will let you look through your, um, your history of like who

2160
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:10,380
joined at like a certain time and by certain names and then let you just mass ban them.

2161
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:11,100
Oh, interesting.

2162
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,860
Which was wonderful.

2163
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:17,100
I've, I've got the tool somewhere and sometimes I still use it.

2164
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:22,620
That's why I like for my follower goal, my follower goal is like a few, you know,

2165
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:25,660
as it shows on my stream is a few off than what I actually have.

2166
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:30,940
So, um, yeah, it's kind of weird that way.

2167
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:34,780
It's funny you mentioned him too, because that's a perfect example of one of those channels.

2168
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:39,100
I think I've maybe ever said one thing in the chat room, but I've watched a lot just on my

2169
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:41,980
Xbox, like in the background when I'm, you know, doing it.

2170
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,420
So it's just, it's just funny.

2171
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:47,020
I have a lot of Twitch people like that where I haven't really, and there's others where like,

2172
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:48,300
I participate and it's nothing like.

2173
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:50,380
He's a great streamer.

2174
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:52,620
I wouldn't watch him in the first place, but it's just, you know,

2175
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:54,780
sometimes I'm just not able to actively chat.

2176
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:56,300
So I just lurk, you know?

2177
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:01,340
For me, it's weird to come out and suddenly say, hi, I'm watching.

2178
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:05,340
Yeah, he's, he's one of the ones that I can give shit to and get it back.

2179
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:06,140
And it's pretty fun.

2180
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:07,820
That's good.

2181
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:08,220
That's good.

2182
01:59:09,180 --> 01:59:10,700
Tease him for his toxic Steve.

2183
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:12,860
All right.

2184
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:18,460
But yeah, but at any rate, I think that whatever it is that Twitch did,

2185
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:23,820
and I want to say that that verified user thing is a pretty big step in it.

2186
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:24,320
Yeah.

2187
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:27,580
I haven't seen very many hate raids.

2188
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:33,020
If anything, in some of my bigger streamer friends chats, I have seen,

2189
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:40,300
um, like a person come in and well, uh, actually a funny scenario was, um,

2190
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,580
it was, was it Lily Pie I was watching?

2191
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:44,540
I think it was Lily Pie.

2192
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:49,980
Um, who this person just came in being like this racist piece of shit.

2193
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:52,940
And she's like, I played like three ads while this person was in my chat.

2194
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:56,860
So I made money off of them.

2195
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:59,020
And then they take themselves out.

2196
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:00,380
Yeah.

2197
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:05,500
So yeah, there's, there's, yeah, I, I've seen a few spam bots and some occasional

2198
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:09,980
nerdom, uh, nerdy things and not in the good kind of way in people's chat, but,

2199
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:14,700
uh, yeah, for the most part, like it seems that a lot of the tactics, which has been

2200
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:16,700
using has been effective and that's good.

2201
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:18,220
No, that's about time.

2202
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:20,060
Good way to start off 2022.

2203
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:24,460
I still think that they need to do something about their auto banning system.

2204
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:32,140
Because there were, there were people that were getting banned, um, for just for like

2205
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:34,780
stuff that wasn't actually like a real offense.

2206
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:39,180
And of course, nobody responds to it.

2207
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:41,020
They'd stay banned for that 30 days.

2208
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:44,540
And then it's a strike, especially bad for people who are trying to go for partner.

2209
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:45,040
Right.

2210
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:46,080
Yeah.

2211
02:00:46,620 --> 02:00:51,980
Which I could use another, you know, 70 people watching my stream at any given point in time.

2212
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:53,100
So could vog.

2213
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:54,060
So could my channel.

2214
02:00:55,100 --> 02:01:00,940
It's just finding that wave to make you, uh, carry carry further.

2215
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:02,300
So, yeah.

2216
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:02,800
All right.

2217
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:08,540
Um, speaking of big things on Twitch, uh, we have to, of course, in our last slotted

2218
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:13,900
story spot tonight, talk about AGDQ or awesome games done quick.

2219
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:18,380
And I'm sure many of you that listen to our show also listen to Bobby Black Wolf, who

2220
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:20,700
is live before us on Sunday nights.

2221
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:25,980
And I would encourage you to check out his podcast if you are a podcast person and not

2222
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:27,100
hearing his show live.

2223
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:32,780
But our pal Bobby was one of the hosts for this and hosted some of the speed runs.

2224
02:01:32,780 --> 02:01:35,580
And I saw, um, I saw the earthbound one, a little bit of that.

2225
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:36,700
That was a lot of fun.

2226
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:39,100
And I watched some of the ones he wasn't hosting too.

2227
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:43,740
It's always a good event, very well received by, um, I think the gaming community, a lot

2228
02:01:43,740 --> 02:01:45,340
of positive vibes in that chat room.

2229
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:47,260
They limited to subscribers only.

2230
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:51,900
So I honestly just that alone clears out a lot of the garbage, uh, because, you know,

2231
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:56,940
I, and I don't think subscribers only is an effective tactic for streamers like dark

2232
02:01:56,940 --> 02:02:01,180
soccer myself, where we don't have the 70 plus people watching, but when you have 50,000

2233
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:03,820
people watching, it's very effective at keeping a lot of the trash out.

2234
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:05,260
So, um, they do a good job with that.

2235
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:08,540
And it's kind of fun to watch, uh, chat sometimes in there.

2236
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:13,500
Um, but games done quick also shattered records.

2237
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:16,540
They raised 3.4 million.

2238
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:21,260
That is the largest amount of money that games done quick, either summer or winter

2239
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:23,820
and the awesome version has ever raised.

2240
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:26,140
And, uh, that was for the prevent cancer foundation.

2241
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:27,420
So that's really cool.

2242
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:32,700
Also during the marathon, there were some new world records set, meaning the fastest

2243
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:38,220
games have ever been run, uh, including, uh, newer games like Kina bridge of spirits.

2244
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:45,340
Uh, and then, uh, pumpkin Jack, uh, Sekiro shadows die twice was a blindfolded that had

2245
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:45,900
a lot of people.

2246
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:49,260
I don't think that was a world record, but that was a, uh, uh, thing that had a lot of

2247
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:49,820
people.

2248
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:50,060
Yeah.

2249
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:52,460
I'm trying to teach crazy.

2250
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:55,420
That was just pretty, pretty awesome.

2251
02:02:55,420 --> 02:02:56,140
Pretty incredible.

2252
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:56,940
It really is.

2253
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:58,700
So, uh, yeah, lots of good stuff to see.

2254
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:03,660
I, a lot of people were tweeting me about the, uh, not itg, which was like basically

2255
02:03:04,540 --> 02:03:09,580
DDR and in the groove, just bananas level, like that level that just makes me exhausted

2256
02:03:09,580 --> 02:03:13,660
looking at it and going like, oh, I'm definitely 40 years old.

2257
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:17,340
Uh, and that whole thing, but, um, props to the people that can do it.

2258
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:22,780
It's a very impressive show and help to raise all the money and smash the records at the

2259
02:03:22,780 --> 02:03:23,260
end of the day.

2260
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:25,020
And isn't that what it's all about?

2261
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:27,100
All right.

2262
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:27,340
Yeah.

2263
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:28,300
Awesome.

2264
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:29,500
All right.

2265
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,980
Uh, let's get to the listener round table.

2266
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:35,740
Unfortunately with the internet cutting in and out, I know the live folks are having

2267
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:36,300
a hard time.

2268
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:37,740
I think they can still hear us.

2269
02:03:37,740 --> 02:03:39,180
I know they can't see us.

2270
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:41,660
It's just blitzing in and out.

2271
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:44,940
I'm so sorry, but it's, there's really nothing I can do about it.

2272
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:50,780
Um, I will, I have a lot more to say on this next week for episode 900.

2273
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:54,620
Uh, I'll unfortunately, yes, I'm announcing an announcement, but I will leave you tease

2274
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:55,500
till then.

2275
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:58,860
Um, so, uh, just don't expect this to last forever.

2276
02:03:58,860 --> 02:04:00,220
That's all I have to say.

2277
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:03,420
Uh, assuming that ding dong is the power going to be going out.

2278
02:04:04,380 --> 02:04:06,860
Oh, is, oh, your power is about to, oh boy.

2279
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:07,260
Oh boy.

2280
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:08,220
What an ending.

2281
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:08,540
All right.

2282
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:13,340
Well, before we end, let me try to see if we got any emails at least to get into tonight.

2283
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:14,940
Okay, cool.

Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

2285
02:04:17,740 --> 02:04:21,100
If you want to send us an email, uh, let's get to the one email that we got this week.

2286
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:23,340
This is back from the seventh.

2287
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:24,940
Um, hi, OLR.

2288
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:29,580
I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the quote fluff discussions on the post Christmas

2289
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:33,500
episode on the subject of free games that turned out to be a pleasant surprise.

2290
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:37,740
I bought a game boy advance on eBay a few years ago and it came with DK King of swing.

2291
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:43,020
I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it to be truly excellent and underrated platform

2292
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:43,500
game.

2293
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:48,780
The L and R buttons control each of donkey, uh, of donkey Kong's hands, which you use

2294
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:52,220
to grab pegs and swing yourself across around the stages.

2295
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:53,180
Super fun.

2296
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:57,580
Anyway, I hope y'all, uh, you all are staying safe and please keep up the good work Elliot B.

2297
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:01,420
Thank you for the email.

2298
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:04,940
And I love that, uh, the, the random stuff that you come across.

2299
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:08,220
And I thought the fluff segment thing worked out really well too.

2300
02:05:08,220 --> 02:05:11,740
Um, you know, most weeks we actually have news to talk about, so I don't know how regular

2301
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:12,940
that segment will be.

2302
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:13,820
Uh, but thank you.

2303
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:14,700
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

2304
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:16,780
It was a fun, uh, fun, fun night.

2305
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:17,500
So I'm sorry.

2306
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:22,780
It took us like four weeks to answer it, but, uh, it is 2022.

2307
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:24,620
It's just my God.

2308
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:25,900
It's all right.

2309
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:26,540
Sucks.

2310
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:27,100
It's all right.

2311
02:05:27,100 --> 02:05:29,340
Things are gonna, things are gonna look onward and upward.

2314
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:37,820
Um, Loki, did you have any last minute stories you wanted to talk to us about?

2315
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:42,940
I don't, I don't.

2316
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:45,520
Okay.

2317
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:50,540
Well, unfortunately, uh, with the internet stuff, I think at least we got through a show,

2318
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:54,220
but I think the forces that be are kind of telling us perhaps it is time to just go ahead

2319
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:55,180
and wrap things up.

2320
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:57,900
And so I think that is what we will do for the night.

2321
02:05:57,900 --> 02:06:00,940
Uh, Hey, we got two hours out at least I'm happy.

2322
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:02,700
It's uh, and the show was good.

2323
02:06:02,700 --> 02:06:04,060
Uh, it's just, yeah.

2324
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:10,860
So much to say, and I'm going to say some stuff soon, but until then, let's go around

2325
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:13,580
and get everybody's final thoughts and dark soccer.

2326
02:06:13,580 --> 02:06:14,460
I'll start with you tonight.

2327
02:06:15,980 --> 02:06:17,980
Um, eat your vegetables.

2328
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:19,520
Okay.

2329
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:21,100
Broccoli is good.

2330
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:22,300
Bye.

2331
02:06:22,300 --> 02:06:22,940
Have a good stream.

2332
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:24,140
All right.

2333
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:24,700
Thank you.

2334
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:25,260
Yep.

2335
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:27,900
Hopefully, uh, some more depths in dark soccer's future tonight.

2336
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:29,100
All right.

2337
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:33,900
Uh, meanwhile, uh, I'll say my final thought and, uh, I just pretty much already said it,

2338
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:39,020
but I was going to say, uh, next week is 900 episodes of OLR, which is no small feat.

2339
02:06:39,020 --> 02:06:43,020
And I want to thank all of you that stick with us through thick and thin be at the podcast

2340
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:47,100
feed to be at here live through bandwidth, suffrage and all that stuff.

2341
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,460
Uh, really appreciate it.

2342
02:06:48,460 --> 02:06:50,540
Uh, episode 900.

2343
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:55,660
I've got a personal announcement I'm going to make on the show that I'm really excited

2344
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:56,300
about.

2345
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:59,420
Uh, those of you that follow me on social media will probably see it sooner.

2346
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:04,380
Um, so I will, uh, talk about that and it's going to be, uh, it's also going to, it is

2347
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:08,060
going to affect the show, but it's going to be, I think, I think good stuff.

2348
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:10,060
So I hope, all right.

2349
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:13,820
Uh, Loki, uh, down to you.

2350
02:07:14,860 --> 02:07:15,180
Yeah.

2351
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:18,940
I'm just hopefully gonna put some more videos soon.

2352
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:22,700
I want to get back into live streaming and again too, at some point.

2353
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:22,940
Yeah.

2354
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:23,340
It's fun.

2355
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:24,060
You should.

2356
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:26,620
I've been trying to do as much of it as I can on weeknights.

2357
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:29,020
Uh, I forgot to talk about Final Fantasy four pixel remaster.

2358
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:30,460
I played more of that this week.

2359
02:07:30,460 --> 02:07:33,900
Um, but I only did, I only did like maybe another hour and a half, but, uh, I'm still,

2360
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:38,300
I'm still enjoying it enough, uh, as much as the font still bothers me, but it is what

2361
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:39,100
it is.

2362
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:39,580
All right.

2363
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:42,780
Um, that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

2364
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:46,140
Thank you guys again for sticking with us, uh, through thick and thin and through a kind

2365
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:47,740
of a rough start to our 20th year.

2366
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:50,540
But, um, it really can only go up from here.

2367
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:51,500
Baby steps, right?

2368
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:53,740
Have a good week, everybody.

2369
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:54,940
Thank you so much for being here.

2370
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:56,060
We'll see you next time.

2371
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:57,020
Happy gaming.

2372
02:07:57,020 --> 02:07:57,420
Good night.

2373
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:25,420
They were all still true.

2374
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:29,420
See you next week.

2375
02:08:53,740 --> 02:09:01,420
Bye.
