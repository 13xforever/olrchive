64 updates, and Nintendo Switch Online Nintendo 64 updates.

This month's new game, this month's improved game or games, and next month's new game

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,420
that might also include next month's improved games.

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,260
These are a few headlines rolled into one theme, now it's time for the 900th episode

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,100
of Orange Lounge Radio, with your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to give you

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,140
details on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,140
where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:47,620
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,940
every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:57,900
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 900 of our

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:05,100
show that is 900 for tonight, January the 23rd of 2022.

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,980
And with me as they have been since June of 2002, say hello to my co-hosts.

14
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,260
First off, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,260
Hi there.

16
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,260
Hi.

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,260
Hi.

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,260
Congratulations on 900 episodes.

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,260
You too.

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,460
If you could sum up 900 episodes of OLR in one word, what would it be?

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,460
What?

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,380
Okay, that's a good one.

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,660
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,660
Hi.

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,900
Hi, Loki.

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Congrats on 900 episodes.

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,900
Yes.

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,060
I'll ask you the same question.

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,180
If you could sum up 900 episodes in one word, what would that be?

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,900
Okay, great.

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,900
Long.

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:50,900
Anyway, a big hi to our chat because we didn't know, did you have a real answer?

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,900
That's it.

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Okay.

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,900
Long.

36
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,780
Um, I think, I think mine might be something like, oh my God, if you remember that old

37
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:10,940
YouTube except the internet in the past few episodes will be, oh my God, be something

38
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,940
like that.

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,980
But I'm going to get to that in a minute.

40
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,620
Uh, I do want to acknowledge our chat room of course, because we do tape live every Sunday

41
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,480
night at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash a VOG network, nine o'clock Eastern

42
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,800
six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby black Wolf show.

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,520
And I, I, I usually, I don't read the, um, bit cheers and the sub donations and things

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,480
like that until the end of the show.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,760
Cause um, you know, a lot, I know a lot of like normal twitch streams you watch kind

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,040
of read that and say, thank you for that.

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Thank you for that.

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,080
Um, but we are trying to record for our podcast, which people can of course download an iTunes,

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,000
Spotify, whatever their favorite podcast app is.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,600
Um, but you go, oh my gosh, like I see you guys donating lots of bits.

51
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,320
I'm seeing, oh my God, there's another five subs, 900 bits, uh, that, and that's not like

52
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,980
a small amount of money, uh, that you guys are saying congrats.

53
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,480
And I'm like, oh my God, do we just get a hype train all the way to level five?

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
I think we did.

55
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
I think we did.

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Oh my God.

57
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Thank you so much.

58
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,040
And I just big love to the community.

59
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,920
We, we really wouldn't get to 900 episodes without you guys.

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,720
Um, those of you that stick with us, especially because I know, uh, with the live stuff, um,

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,560
and we love our podcast listeners too, please don't get me wrong, but the live folks have

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,380
been especially putting up with some crap lately because of all these internet issues

63
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,380
I've been having.

64
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,900
Um, I have bad news and I have good news.

65
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,080
I'm ready to talk about this announcement I've been teasing for a while, which, which

66
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,800
most of you have figured out, but let me start with the bad news.

67
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,560
Um, the bad news is I don't see these internet problems getting fixed anytime soon.

68
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,520
Uh, in fact, I fully expect the internet to crap out at 7 15 Pacific tonight as it did

69
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,840
the last couple of weeks as it's been, uh, throughout the week on my personal connection.

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,440
Um, I'm trying, but my cable company doesn't seem to understand what the problem is and

71
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,440
it's, uh, it's getting pretty ridiculous to be quite honest.

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,360
Um, so unfortunately I'm not sure much can change with that.

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,440
However, uh, we did do some preventative things behind the scenes.

74
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,800
For example, if the show looks a little fuzzier or a little choppier than maybe you're used

75
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,720
to, and this is only for Twitch, this wouldn't affect the podcast at all.

76
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,800
Um, but it's because I purposely did a lower bit rate and only 30 frames a second instead

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,440
of 60 to try to push less video out the door so that if there is a hiccup, I'm hoping our

78
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,440
audio will still get through if nothing else.

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,960
That is something I was noticing in the past couple episodes in the feed.

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,680
It's just the video got really choppy and laggy and you guys could kind of still hear

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
things.

82
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,920
So I'm hoping maybe making some small changes like that, um, will, uh, help those issues.

83
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
So we'll see.

84
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Hopefully, hopefully.

85
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,480
Um, now let's talk about the good news.

86
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:51,520
The good news is I know that this isn't going to happen beyond February because, um, last

87
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,640
summer Alan and I bought a house and you might be thinking, what is taken?

88
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,880
So don't you usually move into a house the next one?

89
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, we bought a new house.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,480
We did things a little differently because, uh, we're not like rich or anything like that.

91
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,120
I don't want you to think it's, it's that sort of situation.

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,800
But, um, what happened is that the, the market in real estate was crazy and we were bidding

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,760
on houses and getting outbid by, I'm telling you $50,000.

94
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,200
We were, we looked at one house in the pocket, oh my God, it would have been beautiful.

95
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,880
Like it would have been great for us.

96
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,600
It had an upstairs loft that would have made the best studio type of area or like arcade

97
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
or something like that.

98
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,760
But unfortunately we got outbid by $50,000 in that place.

99
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,280
So it wasn't meant to be.

100
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,140
Um, however, we got sick of playing that game and you know what?

101
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,280
We found some new construction and we were like, time, time's on our side.

102
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,180
We can wait a little longer and save up and things like that.

103
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,000
And, and let's do, let's do this.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,360
Let's go for the house this way.

105
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,240
So, um, we, we bought some new construction and now the construction is finally finishing.

106
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,520
We've been quiet about it for a long time because, um, out of respect to our current

107
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,560
living situation, we don't know who knows who and things like that.

108
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,740
And just, I'm not wanting to, you know, curse anything or what have you, uh, we just didn't

109
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,980
say anything about it until now.

110
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,980
So the good news with that is that, um, after February, so there's not going to be a show

111
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,020
February 20th, because that'll be the weekend that I'm changing.

112
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:22,320
Uh, but then after that, uh, there will, um, uh, no longer be the old cable provider that

113
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
I use now.

114
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,500
Uh, there's a different fiber internet provider out there and I'm just going to hope it's

115
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,580
a whole lot better experience.

116
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
That's for darn sure.

117
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,020
So there is that.

118
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,580
Um, so thank you guys very much for the kind words and chat.

119
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,580
I appreciate that.

120
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Continued bits.

121
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
Thank you guys so much.

122
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Oh my gosh.

123
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,140
Really, really appreciate that.

124
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
Oh yeah.

125
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,140
You know, and what I love about, and I'm not going to say who the provider is because then

126
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,580
you guys are just going to tell me the, all the negative stuff about that company.

127
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,940
Let me give you, um, this in perspective, there's two companies I can pick from our

128
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,180
current company or this new one.

129
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,480
Which one do you think I'm going with?

130
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,100
No matter what y'all have to say.

131
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,020
Yeah, I'm going with the new one.

132
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,620
Um, but then I see about it.

133
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,060
They don't force a TV package down our throat.

134
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,100
Like it's, it's almost made for people who have cut the cord and it's wonderful.

135
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,820
I'm, I'm so excited about it.

136
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
That's for sure.

137
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,300
So, um, yeah, there you go.

138
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
That's my big announcement.

139
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
I wanted to talk about.

140
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Thank you.

141
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Thank you.

142
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,240
Um, one thing I should address, cause I think people are going to wonder and I think people

143
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,260
have been wondering this for awhile, so I think we should probably bring it up.

144
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,820
Um, and the question, or I guess more of the statement is that, um, the, the thing that's

145
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,780
going to be a little different when, um, Alan and I move into the new house, um, there's

146
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,900
not a studio in it.

147
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,220
Uh, well, fortunately we had to go for a house of a certain size and there's not going to

148
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,100
be a studio in the house.

149
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,340
Um, so there isn't really a studio number eight.

150
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,520
Um, so I guess what I'm trying to say is that for now, uh, OLR is just going to continue

151
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,100
in the virtual form that it has been, um, never say never, I guess, because, you know,

152
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,380
maybe one of the offices can be, I don't, I just don't know how it would work on Twitch,

153
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,640
but never say never.

154
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,980
So I don't want to say like forever, but, um, this is just the way we're going to proceed,

155
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,300
uh, for the future.

156
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,180
Um, you know, and COVID is still a thing too.

157
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,940
You know, um, it's a lot smarter that way, honestly, it, it, yeah.

158
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,000
And like, for example, last night I hosted a show at a theater.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,320
It was a great show.

160
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,500
I had a great time.

161
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,180
Uh, it was a tribute to twin peaks and we actually had, um, like Laura Palmer's actress,

162
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,380
Cheryl Lee was actually there in attendance and so forth.

163
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,540
But obviously doing that and hosting that, even though, you know, I wore a mask and vaccinated,

164
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,860
I took all the precautions and that I tried to minimize my interactions close with people.

165
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,580
I still did a risky thing.

166
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,640
And for that reason, I didn't do anything a few days before I'm not going to do anything

167
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,520
a few days after, just to make sure I'm in the clear with all that stuff with the precautions.

168
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,020
If we had had a show in person tonight, that wouldn't really be the case, right?

169
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,800
Like I could, because I took a risk, I could be exposing the co-host.

170
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,380
So anyway, I think y'all know what I'm getting at is that just for a little while, uh, for

171
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,860
the foreseeable future, we're going to continue this virtual thing.

172
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,580
So, um, and it's been working out.

173
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,580
Um, and things are going to get reconfigured, which I think will be really, so the show's

174
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,700
going to look different in about three weeks because I'm already stewing with some ideas

175
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,340
and I think it will be at the end of the day, really cool.

176
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,400
So please, uh, hang in there, stick with us and thank you for being here.

177
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,020
Let's let's, let's see if we can, let's see if we've got enough gas in the tank to get

178
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,060
to a thousand.

179
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,060
What do you say?

180
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,060
I think we'll do it.

181
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
Let's do it.

182
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,620
All right.

183
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
Let's start off.

184
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,940
That's our big news, but man, there was some big news in the gaming industry this week.

185
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,940
That's for sure.

186
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,780
News so big, Bobby was like, we got to go live now to talk about this.

187
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,660
I was like, yeah, let's, let's, let's talk about it, but there's still stuff to talk

188
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,660
about.

189
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,160
And I want to talk about it with you all tonight.

190
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,700
So Loki, can you get into the kickoff topic tonight?

191
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Yeah.

192
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,460
So Microsoft decided, Hey, you know how you keep asking us about a relationship with Activision

193
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,860
Blizzard and it's a very touchy subject.

194
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,420
We'll just buy them and make it less awkward or more awkward.

195
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,420
I'm not really sure.

196
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,060
So, um, they decided to purchase or at least they intend on purchasing Activision Blizzard

197
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,020
for $70 billion.

198
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,900
Uh, that also include King as well.

199
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,760
So Microsoft will own all of the franchises at that point.

200
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,140
And then, um, yeah, so it's, it is probably one of the largest purchases that, you know,

201
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,200
it's been made in the video game industry, I think.

202
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,680
It's the part that I thought was fascinating.

203
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,600
It's doesn't make Microsoft the biggest company still, it is still behind Sony and Tencent,

204
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
which I think is interesting.

205
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Yeah.

206
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,280
So, um, but still though, I mean, they're, they have quite the, the catalog now, um,

207
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,080
right now there's still a lot up in the air.

208
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,800
They basically done this, they've kind of said the same things that they did with Bethesda

209
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,320
where it's like, okay, yeah, we're going to go ahead and honor our agreements that were

210
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,160
in place already, you know, with like call of duty and stuff like that.

211
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:03,080
So they'll be coming to multiple systems for now, um, in the future, maybe not.

212
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
We'll see.

213
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,560
Um, but yeah, it'd be interesting to see maybe if they bring like some of these titles that

214
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,520
aren't necessarily on Xbox to Xbox, like world of Warcraft or something like that.

215
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,900
Um, but we also see, of course, them planning on bringing Activision Blizzard games to game

216
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,940
pass, which really is probably the end game with this anyways, it's just adding a ton

217
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,620
of, ton more content to, uh, games pass in general.

218
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,860
And you know, there's been obviously some questions like, is Bobby Kotick going to still

219
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,500
be on board for this right now?

220
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Yes.

221
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,260
But I'm not sure after the deal closes, if he will stay, I think they are probably going

222
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,260
to let him go.

223
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,060
A lot of the stuff that's come out later in the week, Loki is, um, pretty much the plan

224
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,420
is that there is no plan for Bobby Kotick after the deal is closed, but they do have

225
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,640
to close the deal because, you know, there's going to be, I'm sure regulators are going

226
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,420
to look at, look at this hell one representative, I think it was Jerry Nadler, um, already kind

227
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,980
of wrote a tweet about, you know, this sounds like it could be, you know, it needs to go

228
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,260
under the microscope and this whole thing.

229
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,500
Oh, this already talks about antitrust.

230
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,540
Oh, Dark Sakura, not all reps feel this way, right?

231
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:26,340
Well, I mean, the, uh, I even hate saying her name, but, uh, Marjorie Taylor Greene

232
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:32,180
sold $15,000 worth of stock the day Microsoft announced that they were going to buy the

233
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
company.

234
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,340
We'll just refer to that one as her.

235
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,340
Her.

236
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,340
Um, which.

237
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,340
They shouldn't be trading stocks in the first place, but that's a whole other thing.

238
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:52,060
Well, um, that resulted in, since their stock went up that day, that was, I mean, it didn't

239
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,020
go up a whole lot, but that gave her about another 200 bucks in capital gains.

240
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:02,100
So, um, the thing is, is that, I mean, if they're going to get Martha Stewart for this,

241
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,740
they need to be looking at her next, just saying she had to have known something.

242
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,780
But I, it's, I just don't see this getting stopped for antitrust.

243
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,220
I mean, I'm not also a legal mind, so I'm not going to try to be an armchair critic

244
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,100
in that regard, but I just, you know, again, Microsoft is not going to be the biggest company

245
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,220
in this regard.

246
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,220
We know that there's going to be at least two others that are still bigger, um, and

247
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,220
it'd be different.

248
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:35,300
Like if they purchase Sony or purchase like Nintendo, that would be a little bit, yeah.

249
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:42,340
I mean, the, the, I think the theory that Microsoft goes down a meta route where you

250
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,460
have Microsoft and then Xbox game studios is its own separate company under Microsoft.

251
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,740
That is probably the closest thing to a, how this plays out that I think it may ultimately

252
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
end up.

253
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,820
Um, I've also like, there was the topic that came up that sometimes companies will offload

254
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,580
part of the sale in order to help it go through.

255
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,700
Um, and an excellent example was brought up in the bonus stream we did earlier in the

256
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:15,060
week where, um, when Disney bought Fox, which was kind of this in the entertainment world,

257
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,060
right?

258
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,180
When Disney bought Fox, uh, they had to unload the Fox sports channels because it was going

259
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,780
to create like a sports monopoly probably because of whatever ABC has and that whole

260
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,780
mess.

261
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,780
So they had to unload that.

262
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,300
They have like ESPN or something like that.

263
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,740
Yeah, I think it's something around that.

264
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,140
So it would have created some type of like sports monopoly.

265
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,380
So the thought was that, well, maybe like if anything seems like it's spin off-able

266
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,140
from ABK, it feels like it's King.

267
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,180
And I'm not saying that King is bad.

268
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,500
Please do not hear me say, I'm not saying they're expendable or that I'm not, that's

269
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,020
not what I'm saying.

270
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,580
But what I'm saying is that what I believe Microsoft really wants is the A and B side

271
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:02,560
of things because Microsoft's mobile strategy seems to be game pass, the cloud, that kind

272
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
of gaming.

273
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,980
That's their mobile strategy.

274
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,860
I'm not sure, and I may be wrong and that's fine.

275
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,140
I'm not sure a mobile developer is what they really want.

276
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,380
And maybe if they kind of unload that, then it's not going to give the perception that

277
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,940
Microsoft has some weird, or they're going for a mobile thing, which they, which when

278
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,680
the Windows phone is no longer a thing, I don't see as an issue anyway.

279
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,480
So I actually, I don't know if King gets offloaded because I'm not sure Microsoft having a mobile

280
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,140
developer means anything.

281
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,380
All of their, all of their opportunities in mobile have flopped.

282
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,620
And I think now it's about cloud gaming.

283
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,940
So we'll see.

284
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,540
Some other comments in chat about what gets spun off.

285
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,180
Rama points out when Walgreens bought Rite Aid, they had to unload half the stores for

286
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,620
similar reasons, but thank God they kept thrifty ice cream.

287
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,220
I added that part because that's the most important.

288
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,220
That's the most important.

289
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,500
Well, yeah, I don't think, well, they don't have that in all locations, but I know like

290
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,780
the one we have over here in Folsom mentions thrifty ice cream.

291
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,980
They still have thrifty ice cream counters in Sacramento, which is great and probably

292
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,140
some other parts in Orkal.

293
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
It's great.

294
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
Yeah.

295
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,140
There was one by Matt.

296
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
I haven't been to one of those and well, yeah.

297
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,700
I could give, I could give fuck all where my pills come from as long as I get thrifty

298
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
ice cream.

299
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
That's all.

300
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,700
Let's see.

301
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,220
Pod culture is talking about Sprint and T-Mobile had to unload some stuff for that to happen.

302
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:33,160
And DJ Rama says that was Boost Mobile, the Dish Network and shut down Virgin Mobile.

303
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,180
So I can tell you quite a bit about that first hand, right.

304
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:46,160
And then Boost went to.

305
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
It was Dish.

306
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,100
Yeah, Boost went to Dish.

307
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,900
And then they're still under and then they went off to T-Mobile.

308
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,980
So there was a sort of a big series of transitions with that.

309
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:06,640
And we may see something weird where some of Activision Studios get spun off.

310
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,080
We may, I mean, we could, I don't want to sound too tinfoil hatty, but I could see a

311
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,920
situation where Blizzard gets spun off into an independent thing again or get sold to

312
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
someone else.

313
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,740
I could see that.

314
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,740
I don't think that makes sense with Microsoft strategy, but I could see it.

315
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,720
I don't think anything should be off the table in that regard.

316
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,880
So anyway.

317
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,980
So yeah, Loki, any other headlines from this whole thing, because this has been nonstop

318
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,960
headlines all week on this.

319
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,780
There's been a lot of like kind of asking for comment regarding basically just the work

320
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,720
situation that Activision Blizzard employees are kind of a part of right now.

321
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,800
And they kind of just been shrugging it off, especially when we're talking about unionization,

322
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,520
which I know we'll get into that a little bit later, but basically saying that they're

323
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:14,080
not trying to come across as experts in what's going on with unions, but I don't know.

324
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,680
So we'll see.

325
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,880
I'm hoping with Microsoft kind of overseeing them now that conditions will be better.

326
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,600
So we'll hopefully see that happening.

327
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,420
I'm not going to profess to know exactly what those employees are going through, but I will

328
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:36,340
venture a guess that the attitude may be one of, could it get any like, at least it

329
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:42,500
won't get any worse or like could Microsoft buying us be any worse than where we were

330
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
going?

331
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,060
Well, yeah, I think, well, if they do get rid of Bobby Kotick, I think that's going

332
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,100
to be a good sign that they're kind of trying to right the ship of it.

333
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,780
So we'll see what happens.

334
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,840
Only time will tell.

335
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,380
I don't really know what the work culture.

336
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,060
I mean, I can only imagine that work culture in like Microsoft or something like that is

337
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,240
better.

338
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,940
I don't think it, we haven't heard a lot of stories coming out of Microsoft.

339
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,020
I'm sure there's crunch and stuff like that still, but we haven't heard of anything like

340
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
bad.

341
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
Yeah.

342
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:18,840
Well, DJ Ramis in our chat says, as a former Microsoft employee, I can tell you firsthand

343
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,760
that Microsoft will take care of you as an employee, seriously.

344
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,380
And I think generally, I think the industry regards Phil Spencer pretty highly and what

345
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,580
he's done for Xbox.

346
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:35,060
And I think things feel, you know, will be like the fact that it will be him running

347
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:41,260
that and not Bobby Kotick does give me some warm fuzzies.

348
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:47,100
The part that gives me cold pricklies is that Bobby Kotick is going to get like a quarter

349
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,060
of a billion dollar payout when he leaves.

350
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,920
If all this, I mean, nobody really knows the terms of the deal.

351
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,700
And I know there's stuff that's around the Internet about the contracts and stuff that

352
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,420
I think are from a year ago though, but still, it's very clear he will get some very large

353
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,060
payout when he goes.

354
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,860
And that sucks because it feels like the bad guy's winning.

355
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,060
He shouldn't get shit like, like let's be honest.

356
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,580
How did this even happen?

357
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,200
How is, I mean, this, when I saw the headline, when I woke up, which is funny, cause I slept

358
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,620
in on Tuesday cause I actually had the day off.

359
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:24,040
And when I woke up, I was like, you know, that wasn't on my 2022 bingo card for gaming.

360
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,560
It wasn't in the prediction jar that we did here on OLR last week, but it really should

361
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
have been.

362
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,360
Like when I, when I kind of heard that, I was like, you know, I'm not surprised.

363
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,200
Like we, we kind of knew Activision Blizzard was fucked and they knew it.

364
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,600
And, and you hear these stories about they were trying to offload the company in November.

365
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,700
Well first they were going to buy this, this is the part that blows my mind.

366
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,860
They were trying to buy a company like Kotaku or GamesRadar to change the narrative.

367
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,920
And I don't know if that was about like that they wanted to buy a company to get other

368
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,760
types of stories published about the company or no, literally they are buying the, the

369
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,020
journalistic things to write different stories.

370
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,980
That part is like, you know, kind of thing.

371
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Obviously it didn't happen.

372
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,820
Let's focus on that versus actually making positive change.

373
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,540
And again, look at who writes our textbooks.

374
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
Yeah.

375
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,540
Well, it's a, it's a common, common, common tactic.

376
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,540
Yeah.

377
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,120
It's, it's, uh, it's, so that's, that was interesting at all.

378
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,740
But then, uh, they want their own revisionist history.

379
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,380
Activision Blizzard went to other suitors because I think when they realized Microsoft

380
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,420
made a deal, they wanted to see if somebody else will give them more money.

381
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,060
And it's known that, um, Facebook meta is one of the other suitors they talked to.

382
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,420
Thank, thank God that didn't happen.

383
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,700
Can we all take a look?

384
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,940
I don't care if you're the biggest, I don't care if you're the biggest Sony fanboy and

385
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,460
you hate everything that Microsoft does and says and breeze, which I think, I think is

386
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
silly in the first place.

387
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,180
And I would say the exact same thing about vice versa, um, because I, I definitely know

388
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:09,540
those people that are vice versa and it's, it's, it's ridiculous.

389
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,780
But uh, here's the thing, as much as you can hate Microsoft with every fiber of your being,

390
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,940
it still could have been worse.

391
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,620
Like can you imagine if meta had bought Activision?

392
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,980
Like I would have, I don't know what I would have done.

393
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,580
I would have, I would have been so upset.

394
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,740
I think, I think, I think tonight would have been a night of mourning, uh, for sure.

395
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,140
Uh, and we don't know who the third suitor was.

396
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:45,740
I would speculate a Google Stadia question mark or, or an Amazon.

397
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,860
I would, well, that doesn't mean, but that doesn't mean Activision didn't try to start

398
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,860
conversation.

399
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,820
I would speculate a Google or an Amazon where that was the other suitor, but I, at the end

400
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,820
of the day, I don't know.

401
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,300
So, and neither do you.

402
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,820
So um, Bobby Black will suggest Tencent.

403
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,760
Well, didn't Tencent get that stake in Ubisoft?

404
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,220
So I kind of feel like Tencent is making moves other places.

405
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,540
I mean, maybe, uh, yeah, but I, I Google and Amazon are the two I'm, I'm thinking of.

406
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:18,100
So so what do you all think of this at the end of the day?

407
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:24,220
What do you, do you, do you, cause I, I, I do see the arguments that gaming is becoming

408
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,300
too big.

409
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:31,020
It's becoming these gigantic monolith companies and so forth, but I'm also of the mindset

410
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,780
that particularly when it comes to Activision Blizzard, something had to change.

411
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,740
The dam was going to burst.

412
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,060
That company was literally being run into the ground by horrible mismanagement and people

413
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,020
were abandoning ship left and right.

414
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,940
Something had to happen.

415
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,100
And I, you know, even though I, I definitely hear and I understand the whole like gaming

416
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:01,640
monolith thing, I, Bobby Kotick is to blame and set that company up for this to happen.

417
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,800
I don't see how else I, it was that or they, they go bankrupt.

418
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,580
Like they, they, they're getting bought out one way or another.

419
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,580
Any thoughts from y'all on your thoughts on this whole purchase?

420
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,380
I don't care how much Kotick gets paid.

421
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,620
I want him gone to not have to hear about him again would make me happy.

422
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,540
I can't stand how he's trying to change the narrative either.

423
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,400
Like he was interviewed for something and he was like, well, why do you think the stock

424
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
has gone down?

425
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,020
And you know, of course, instead of talking about him because of him, well, which I logically

426
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,980
know nobody's going to say, oh, it's my fault.

427
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,860
Um, although, although don't we remember about three months ago when Final Fantasy

428
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:52,280
14 and Walker was having issues and Yoshi P got up there and said, I apologize.

429
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,100
Wasn't that the most refreshing fucking thing to ever happen in the gaming industry?

430
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
I apologize.

431
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Yes.

432
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,500
You gotta taking a pay cut.

433
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,460
I'm sorry.

434
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,540
What a refreshing fucking perspective.

435
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:13,700
But Bobby Kotick, no, no, no says, well, with Diablo 4 getting delayed and Overwatch 2 getting

436
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:21,820
delayed and Call of Duty not being up to expectation, whose fucking fault is that, dummy?

437
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,780
And I'm glad he's getting called the fuck out for it.

438
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,820
That Overwatch producer, I don't know if it was current or former on Twitter that basically

439
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,540
called him the fuck out and was like, what?

440
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,060
Overwatch 2 is, is getting put off because you've been putting us on crunch projects

441
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,060
that have gone nowhere.

442
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,260
Call him out.

443
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,820
And I, at least I will say this and dark soccer, I, I would think you would agree, but let

444
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
me know.

445
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,900
Thank God the media is calling him out on that bullshit and not letting him dictate

446
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,540
the narrative.

447
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,380
They have to, they have to combat it.

448
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,140
I mean, like, no, you're, you're wrong.

449
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,180
It's totally your fault and we're going to hold, you know, we're going to nail your ass

450
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,180
on it.

451
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,180
Yeah.

452
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,420
So he, not even in a good way.

453
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:09,620
He may get a $200 million payout, but you know what he won't get is his dignity and

454
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,620
his reputation.

455
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,620
Shit.

456
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,980
I wish that the day he, you know what, y'all, y'all, y'all, here we go.

457
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
Here we go.

458
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,900
This is how I want to open OLR.

459
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
The week Bobby.

460
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,900
Okay.

461
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Y'all with me?

462
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
Y'all with me?

463
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,980
Cause it's going to require costumes and props, costumes and props.

464
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,020
The week Bobby Kotick is gone.

465
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:34,300
I want us to start the show and I want us all to have our bells and I want us to go

466
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:43,340
shame, shame, shame with our bells while Bobby Kotick leaves this industry forever.

467
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,300
And we shame him into the night.

468
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,540
Sound good?

469
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,140
I mean, I have better things I could cosplay.

470
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,820
Honestly, Rob, it's not worth it.

471
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,220
I don't care about him.

472
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,500
I just don't want to acknowledge his existence anymore.

473
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,140
He's going to be crying into his $320 million.

474
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,620
I don't want to give him any attention.

475
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:12,540
I want him to fade out into obscurity as a stinky shit stain on video game history.

476
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,820
But there, there, there isn't a little part of you that wants to be there and start yelling

477
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,060
muck, scum, rabbit droppings.

478
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,580
There isn't a little part of you.

479
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:33,020
I don't want to give a piece of shit like that.

480
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,740
Any energy is not worth my energy.

481
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
I get it.

482
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,740
I get it.

483
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
All right, Loki.

484
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
What about?

485
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
Oh, sorry.

486
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,740
I can take that energy and put it into combating people like him.

487
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,740
Fair enough.

488
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,180
So maybe your final thought on this whole Activision Blizzard thing, and is this a good

489
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,180
thing or not?

490
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,540
Yeah, I think it's a good thing because they, I mean, maybe at least they'll, you know,

491
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,340
up the quality of certain titles that they put out.

492
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:05,420
It's been just a mess with like Call of Duty and stuff, but I don't know, we'll see.

493
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,540
All right, let's move on.

494
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,800
I'm sure this is going to be a developing story and we're going to hear a lot about

495
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,140
this over the next year as, you know, it starts to get looked at under a magnifying glass.

496
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,940
I will give a quick plug because I talked at length with Bobby for like an hour or 15

497
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,340
minutes earlier this week, and that video, it's up on YouTube.

498
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,940
So if you're a subscriber here at Twitch TV, you can see it in the Twitch archives, but

499
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,380
we decided, you know what, let's put this one up on YouTube on the house so you can

500
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,460
see that on our YouTube as well over at Channel VOG Network.

501
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,940
We don't use our YouTube for a lot, so I'm going to point you in that direction to check

502
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,940
that one out.

503
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,940
So there you go.

504
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
All right.

505
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,260
Odigerama S says, open the show with celebration by cooling the game.

506
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,420
That's a DMCA violation and cost more money than he's worth.

507
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:59,580
In theory, I'm with your brother, but in execution, we can't.

508
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,380
All right, let's move on.

509
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,360
Let's shift the conversation away from idiot CEOs to more important people, us, and talk

510
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,000
about our gaming weeks and the types of games we have been playing this week.

511
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,260
So let me go to Dark Sakura.

512
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
How was your gaming week?

513
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
You want to guess?

514
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:21,580
I'm going to say Dead by Daylight, Fantasian, Word Scramble.

515
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,940
Have you gotten on the Wordle train yet?

516
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,020
No, and I'm not going to.

517
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,300
It's fine.

518
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,580
It's inoffensive.

519
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,780
I like Wordle.

520
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,500
I like that it's one a day and I don't like everyone freaking posting their little weird

521
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
square things that make zero sense to anybody else.

522
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Yeah, it does.

523
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,140
It does seem a little bit cultish and I'm guilty of posting it, but I think that's kind

524
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,860
of the brilliance of it in a weird way.

525
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:56,940
I am perfectly happy with the games that I play.

526
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:02,340
I actually did some screwing around, so I have a VHS key.

527
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,940
Oh, yeah, that's right.

528
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:10,300
I heard you were trying to get that working on your Mac, so you cracked the code and got

529
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,940
a key to VHS, huh?

530
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:22,540
To tell you how it happened, I happened to give somebody a sub in a mutual friend's chat.

531
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,580
I'm trying not to get anybody in trouble.

532
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,500
And that mutual friend had met through playing VHS.

533
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:37,060
And I was like, yeah, I've messaged the VHS devs to see if they have any information about

534
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,860
this running in Parallels and everything.

535
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,940
And the person messages me is like, do you want to code?

536
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,220
I'm like, yes, I want to code.

537
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,180
So I have a code.

538
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,340
And we should say we should say because not everybody's just going to know VHS.

539
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,300
We're not talking about the old 80s videotape.

540
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,260
We're talking about a game, which that's the vibe that another asymmetrical game, but it's

541
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,020
a bit different than it's a bit different than it by the way.

542
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,020
Yeah.

543
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:06,020
Not not gore and horror, but more cheesy play as teenagers trapped in 80s VHS, you know,

544
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:11,780
direct-to-video slasher flicks, but like gremlins slasher flicks, like not actually gory.

545
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,780
Yeah.

546
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,460
And you have to kill the monster or before the monster kills you.

547
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:24,380
So so anyway, I I got the game to run.

548
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,960
Now the problem being is that every time I go into the tutorial so that I can practice

549
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,740
playing the game, I have the eternal loading screen and the loading screen has full animation.

550
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,740
You know, I wonder what would happen if I just left it to run overnight so the game

551
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:45,260
will run and I don't really have too many problems getting it to that point until I

552
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,800
try to get into the tutorial.

553
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:53,580
It will even cue me for a match, but I can't I haven't let it stay in queue.

554
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,260
I don't want to start playing the game and then have it not work on me while I'm in a

555
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,140
match and then screw everybody else over.

556
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:06,140
So I am letting another friend use my account.

557
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,780
Another streamer friend who has, you know, said is hiding, hiding my username, hiding

558
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
everything.

559
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,220
No one's going to get in trouble, special password and everything, but at least someone

560
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,220
gets to enjoy the game for a little bit that wouldn't have otherwise enjoyed it.

561
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:28,420
So but I can tell you right now when I think the virtualization for Windows 11 ARM gets

562
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,540
better, I think VHS is going to have no problem running.

563
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,340
So keep giving the feedback to the devs.

564
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,140
That's what betas are for.

565
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,420
You know, that's what I'm doing.

566
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:44,980
That being said, since I had to reinstall my virtual, I basically had to recreate my

567
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,180
virtual machine and reinstall Windows 11.

568
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:53,900
I'm now going to see if I can get Mass Effect to work because it's running a lot better

569
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,540
than it was.

570
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,380
So I've reinstalled Mass Effect.

571
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,500
I haven't started running it or anything.

572
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,700
I did also make another discovery because now I've just sort of been playing around

573
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,860
with different things behind the scenes is that Dead by Daylight will run on Windows

574
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
ARM.

575
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,500
What doesn't run is the anti-cheat.

576
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:21,300
Easy anti-cheat won't run, which is funny because VHS uses that too.

577
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,380
But I have no idea what the difference is, why the launcher and everything is working

578
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,620
there but the one for Dead by Daylight isn't.

579
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,140
The only thing is that when I load Dead by Daylight directly, in absence of the anti-cheat,

580
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:39,180
then it doesn't think I'm online for Steam.

581
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:47,700
That being said, I am now shopping around for a graphics card to try to get my old PC

582
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:55,140
rebuilt, thankfully with some parts that a good friend was kind enough to gift me.

583
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,140
Thank you.

584
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:03,580
I just need a better graphics card for it and to give it another go.

585
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,420
So we're gonna see.

586
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,260
But yeah, I've been doing a lot more stuff with other games, not necessarily playing

587
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:16,740
them, but working on getting them to work in the background.

588
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,380
I don't know if I have anything that would be helpful, but if you need PC parts, I'm

589
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,540
gonna be dismantling the old show PC because it serves no purpose.

590
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,660
It's not gonna have what I want.

591
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,660
It's way too much.

592
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
Thought I'd try.

593
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
Thought I'd try.

594
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,660
But thank you.

595
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,660
Yeah.

596
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,660
All right.

597
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,660
Well, let's move on.

598
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,300
Loki, how was your gaming week?

599
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,580
It was all Minecraft, as usual.

600
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,500
I did find something funny though.

601
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:47,060
So I mean, it was bound to happen sooner or later, but there's been some let's plays

602
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:53,100
being put up for Pixel Poops number two on YouTube, one of which I saw that he really

603
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,700
hated it.

604
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,500
But yeah, I had good points.

605
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,380
But like, obviously, being the one that made it like, I understand why I couldn't do certain

606
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,380
things they want.

607
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,500
Also, like playing with a turbo controller uses too easy, like, yeah, because you're

608
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,780
playing as a turbo controller, you idiot.

609
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,580
But it's fine.

610
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,900
Not everybody's gonna like it.

611
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,900
Let me ask you this.

612
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,620
We're celebrating 900 episodes tonight and a 20 year history of this show.

613
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:28,180
And sometimes, Loki, I think you're viewed as the critical one, especially when it comes

614
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,740
to things like Nintendo and so forth.

615
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:34,260
We've talked at length about how a lot of that does come from a place of love, ultimately.

616
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,940
But you're the first to be critical about a video game and its flaws and so forth.

617
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,500
Now it sounds like the tables might be turned a little bit and you're kind of hearing and

618
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,500
you know, in the back of your mind, well, what this reviewer is talking about are limitations

619
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
of the hardware.

620
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,540
I can't do the things they're asking for.

621
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:57,100
Does it change your perspective at all in talking about games this way?

622
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,860
It's more expectations too.

623
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,980
Like they have like the game, the purpose of the game is supposed to be like a simple

624
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,060
arcade game.

625
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,940
So like, they're like, well, the game plays all the same through all the levels.

626
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:13,620
I'm like, yeah, but haven't you played like Pac-Man or Mr. Do or like any of these like

627
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:19,340
old 80s arcade games where, yeah, the gameplay is going to be the same across all the levels.

628
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,640
It doesn't change throughout the thing.

629
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,780
And so it's just the expectations that they have.

630
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,580
Some of the things they had good points like, like, why isn't there an enemy, like, say

631
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:33,040
that jumps over one of the poops and then, you know, you have to put two in a row or

632
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
something like that.

633
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,500
And like, yes, I did consider stuff like that.

634
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,300
The problem is because their behavior is very random.

635
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:46,120
If you put that, if you have an enemy like that and they're near the end of the screen

636
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,580
and you put down like something to try to trap them and they jump over off the screen,

637
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,740
it seems unfair to the player.

638
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,260
And so there's like a lot of things I couldn't do because it would be, it would seem unfair

639
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,420
because there'd be no way to combat it because it's just the enemy behavior.

640
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,340
But like it, yeah, I understand that.

641
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,980
But also at the same time, they're like, well, I didn't like it cause it's too easy.

642
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,520
And like, yeah, you see him play at the turbo controller and then you just like build the

643
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,980
entire screens like, okay, and I got nothing to do.

644
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:18,680
But normally if you play with a turbo controller, it's very frantic and it's that.

645
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,620
So he's missing something with that.

646
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
It's fine.

647
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,620
Like whatever, you know,

648
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,420
I'm glad you have a measured approach to the feedback of nothing else.

649
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,940
Like you're, I'm glad you have, cause honestly, Loki, I would normally tell you, and you know

650
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,860
this, don't read the comments section.

651
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,460
Don't watch these YouTube's nothing.

652
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,460
It's only going to demotivate you, but at least it sounds like you kind of, you know,

653
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,340
you're, you're approaching this with the whole, like, okay, it is what it is.

654
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,060
And like, there's some things that is not going to please this guy, but he had a point

655
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,260
here or there.

656
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,900
And I'll think about that, you know, with future games.

657
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,460
Like I, and I get it, like if the hardware stuff or even maybe necessarily my coding

658
00:37:53,460 --> 00:38:00,000
skills or whatever were, you know, there's probably ways you can cram more stuff in there,

659
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,540
but like I just couldn't.

660
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,340
I just, I just didn't want, I don't want these YouTube's and I don't think they are,

661
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
but I need to say it.

662
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,140
I don't want these YouTube's to discourage you from doing another.

663
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:15,700
Oh no, no, no, no, no, it's, it's, it's just like, no, it's only one person that doesn't

664
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
like it.

665
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,300
And it's well, I don't like it either.

666
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
No, I'm just kidding.

667
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,300
I think it's fine.

668
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,300
You know, I love it.

669
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,580
To be fair and say, it's not like somebody, like they didn't give it a good shot.

670
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,140
Like he played like two hours worth of the game and I get it.

671
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Yeah.

672
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,820
Especially if you're playing with, like I said, turbo controller, um, because he says

673
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,280
his controller is breaking.

674
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,340
So that's why he had to play with the turbo or something like that.

675
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,820
Turn the turbo off.

676
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,820
Exactly.

677
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,260
Well, I think he, I think he had like a controller that has like, you know, turbo way and then

678
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,620
regular a, and so his a button was broken, so he had to play through whatever, but like,

679
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:57,140
so some of that is his fault, but some of that is, yeah, it's just the way the game

680
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
is.

681
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
Yeah.

682
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
I get it.

683
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,940
Like some of the complaints were valid criticisms.

684
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,860
Well, did he say anything good?

685
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,860
Like the music's good or it's no, he got tired of the music too, because he's all, it's

686
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,700
the same songs over and over again.

687
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,940
It's like, yeah, I only have limited space to put audio, but like, it's fine.

688
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,620
So whatever, you're not going to please everybody.

689
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,620
It's fine.

690
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,620
That's true.

691
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,620
He bought the game.

692
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,620
He played it for a couple of hours.

693
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,180
I was going to say at the end of the day, did you give him a code?

694
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,180
Nope.

695
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,180
Then he bought it and you got his money.

696
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,220
Bought a copy of the game.

697
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,220
So that's fine.

698
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,220
Yeah.

699
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,220
It's completely fine.

700
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,220
You know what?

701
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,220
You know, you can't please everybody.

702
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,220
That's right.

703
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,220
Perfectly fine.

704
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,220
It kind of, it's funny to me because it almost sounds like the reverse is happening where

705
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,900
it's like you get his perspective as the cynical gamer.

706
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,020
You're like, whatever I get it from his, it's kind of funny.

707
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,020
All right.

708
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,340
Um, my gaming week, uh, pretty much a lot of the same old stuff.

709
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
Final Fantasy 14.

710
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,380
I got my bard to level 90.

711
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,900
So another max level character.

712
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,220
Uh, I've also been playing, um, dead by daylight here and there.

713
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,860
Uh, I die damage.

714
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,620
I got my Cheryl to prestige three.

715
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,500
So that's the first character that I've actually gone through the blood web the most number

716
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,540
of times you can and prestige three.

717
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,180
So that was, I guess, the achievement.

718
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,180
Yeah.

719
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,980
So I have my, I'm actually close to getting my Freddie to prestige too.

720
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,980
Oh, cool.

721
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,980
Cool.

722
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,220
I haven't even prestige one, any killer.

723
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,340
So by the way, before I forget, I did get pig adept.

724
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,900
Oh, congrats.

725
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,900
That's a hard one to get.

726
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,100
Uh, it was, but I was on my game that night.

727
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,500
I didn't mean to interrupt, but I had to say, no, I was going to say, and I know the tone

728
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,060
that starts on Tuesday, I think is all about saw and pig pig and tap.

729
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,120
So maybe you'll get some cosmetics out of that.

730
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,120
So did you see though?

731
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
The preview picture?

732
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,120
Yeah, I did.

733
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
I saw your, your tweet.

734
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,980
It was like, please let this be a cosmetic and it is, it has to be a cosmetic.

735
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:52,020
It has to, I've been checking schema's channel, the guy who does all of the leak renders and

736
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,460
everything and I haven't seen anything on there yet.

737
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,940
So I'm just crossing my fingers.

738
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,500
We should be pretty close to, to the public test of the ring new chapter.

739
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,620
That's pretty exciting too.

740
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,620
So we'll see.

741
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
All right.

742
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,620
Anyway.

743
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,260
Um, also one of the thing I want to mention on my gaming week though is, um, no man's

744
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,240
sky, which I know I play a lot, but I did something very special in no man's sky because

745
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,140
there's no, um, expedition going on now.

746
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,300
The, the repeats all finished.

747
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,620
So if you, you missed expedition one, two, three, four, sorry.

748
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,220
They've come and gone again.

749
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,060
And so you're not going to be able to do them.

750
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,060
Uh, and right now there is no expedition.

751
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,420
I am assuming expedition five is waiting in the wings for whatever the next patch ends

752
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,040
up being for no man's sky.

753
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,220
So in the interim, I was like, you know what, I should work on some achievements.

754
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,700
And there's one staring me in the face is the hardest achievement in the entire game

755
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,700
because it's get to the center of the galaxy, which is basically beating the game.

756
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:50,640
Although spoiler alert, all it does, it starts you in a new galaxy.

757
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
That's it.

758
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
That's the end of the game.

759
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,480
So, um, but it's, it's, you know, that's not, you know, the point is exploration and all

760
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
that.

761
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,300
So I don't, I don't judge it for that, but, um, I, you have to get to the center of the

762
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,620
galaxy on permadeath.

763
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,580
And not only is it permadeath, but permadeath is twice as hard as regular mode.

764
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,060
Your life bars deplete twice as fast.

765
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:18,420
You can only hold stacks of 250, not 999, like a normal mode.

766
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,420
It is a lot harder.

767
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,480
And I will tell you, when I first started permadeath mode, I died in five minutes on

768
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,600
the first planet.

769
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,940
But I will also tell you this, the hardest part of permadeath mode is getting off the

770
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,520
first planet, because right as soon as your game starts, the clock's ticking and you've

771
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,280
got to be able to find sodium and oxygen fast, and you have to know, or a cave opening.

772
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,060
And some planets are just not going to be as friendly as others.

773
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,360
So my first planet, I died in less than five minutes.

774
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:51,340
Second one, I got that inertia going where I got to my ship, was able to fix the ship.

775
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,340
Okay.

776
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,140
I can make stacks and stacks of life support gels and ion batteries.

777
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,940
And I was good after that.

778
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,940
And guess what?

779
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,500
I got the achievement for getting to the center of the galaxy in permadeath.

780
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:09,540
I did cheese it a little bit, um, because I just kept going to the space anomaly, the

781
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:15,140
multiplayer hub over and over until I saw a base that said, uh, center of the galaxy.

782
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,420
And I finally found one that said end of galaxy one green system.

783
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,680
And I went to it and sure enough, a good Judy had built a base and a green system at the

784
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,000
edge of the galaxy.

785
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,120
And I was one jump away from the center of the galaxy.

786
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,120
So I did cheese it a little bit.

787
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,720
However, I still think to get to that point, I mean, you still have to go through a big

788
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,960
chunk of the story.

789
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,360
You have to get the space anomaly.

790
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,560
You have to build your first warp cell, and you're doing all this in permadeath mode with

791
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,040
limited stacks where you can't just stack carbon and ferrite dust to your heart's content.

792
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,200
So it was challenging.

793
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,020
And so I'm still going to pat myself on the back a little bit.

794
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,500
And according to the Xbox statistics, only 0.11% of players have unlocked that achievement.

795
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,040
So one in a thousand have gotten that achievement.

796
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,420
So I've officially reached galaxy brain level of no man's sky.

797
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
And it feels great.

798
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,860
Now I just need to go clean up a couple other non permadeath achievements that are just

799
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,860
grinds.

800
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,860
And that's what I'll do next.

801
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,220
I will have my full thousand out of a thousand.

802
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:20,560
So Bobby Black Wolf, it is possible to end your achievement score in zero.

803
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,760
Just so you know, you just you have to get them all.

804
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,760
And that's what I intend to do.

805
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,960
So but yeah, you all know I love that game and what it's become over the last five years.

806
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,940
So that was a very meaningful achievement to get.

807
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,320
And I'm sure I will get really verklempt when I get that Xbox equivalent of platinum.

808
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,060
There are no platinum trophies on Xbox.

809
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,600
You just have the thousand out of a thousand.

810
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,060
So yeah, I feel good.

811
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,400
All right.

812
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,440
That's it for my gaming week.

813
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,620
I think we can get into some more news.

814
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:58,480
I will just mention we will not be here February 20th for reasons I already mentioned.

815
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,980
But we will still be here over the next few weeks.

816
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,540
So let's try to get into some more gaming news tonight.

817
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,060
Loki, why don't you start us off?

818
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:11,760
Yeah, so probably one of the first things that everyone was wondering once Microsoft

819
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,140
talked about purchasing Activision Blizzard is, hey, are we going to see some of these

820
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,560
older franchises come back?

821
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,240
You know, we're going to take some of these studios off of making Call of Duty games every

822
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,960
year.

823
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,440
And I think it's still a bit early for all that.

824
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,700
But Phil Spencer was saying that we're hoping to be able to work with them when the deal

825
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,860
closes to make sure we have some resources to work on franchises that I love from my

826
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,120
childhood and the teams really want to get.

827
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:42,360
I'm looking forward to these conversations to really think about adding resources, increasing

828
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,360
capabilities.

829
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,680
So it's not off the table, but nothing definitive yet because they haven't purchased the company

830
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,680
yet.

831
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,680
So let that happen first.

832
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:58,360
And we'll talk about bringing back Guitar Hero or whatnot, but might be cool.

833
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,280
Some of the franchises he had talked about, apparently, from this Washington Post article

834
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,220
was King's Quest, Guitar Hero and Hexen.

835
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,300
Those are and that's that's a dream list.

836
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,300
Yeah, fuck yeah, Hexen.

837
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:18,020
I think that's like at the top of my list of what I want to see come back for sure.

838
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,420
What's interesting, you know, and Bobby, you know, because we tape live here at VOG Network,

839
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,980
and so I'm usually sitting here as I think a lot of us are listening to Bobby and watching

840
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,740
the chat engage with his show.

841
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,260
And obviously, this is the big headline on his show tonight, too.

842
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,260
And it was interesting.

843
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,400
People in chat were piping up talking about what about a new river raid?

844
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,720
What about a new pitfall?

845
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:43,320
I have to be honest and respectfully, folks, I I do don't want that, like a new pitfall.

846
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:49,080
Like how would a new pitfall not just be Uncharted or Tomb Raider?

847
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:54,640
Like in my mind, a modern pitfall are those types of games that sure slap pitfall Harry

848
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,960
on it and call it pitfall, but it's just going to then it's going to feel reductive to that.

849
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,720
And what is there now?

850
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,660
Where I would be cool with it.

851
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,860
And I would love to see this get explored.

852
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,940
I just worry about Microsoft's commitment to retro after Game Room.

853
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:18,020
However, I do remember when the Xbox 360 arcade first came out.

854
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:25,380
We got a lot of pretty cool redos and reskins of older games, but like with Xbox Live features

855
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,580
like multiplayer and things like that.

856
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:33,640
I would love a pitfall that still keeps its retro roots in mind.

857
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,200
Maybe something that's like a pitfall, pitfall three.

858
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,840
I would, I would be all about a pitfall three that is still like a side scrolling adventure,

859
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,280
like a little game.

860
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,200
Why not let something like pitfall go to a small team of like three or four people and

861
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,720
see what they come up with as like a small little, you know, cute little project that

862
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,720
I would support.

863
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,720
And same thing with like river raid.

864
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,220
Like if a river raid game were to come out, it wouldn't even fucking look like the game

865
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:06,180
you remember unless maybe it was something that was geared towards a small or an indie

866
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,180
type of thing.

867
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,740
And if that's the direction Microsoft goes, then I feel much differently.

868
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:16,280
And I think that can actually be really awesome to see like a pitfall that keeps retro stuff

869
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,540
in mind and is kind of uniquely pitfall in that regards.

870
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,540
Yeah.

871
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,540
Now you're talking chat.

872
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,540
Change, right?

873
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,600
Says pitfall championship edition, like Pac-Man.

874
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,120
Maybe not literally, but you're on the right track.

875
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,720
That was a great evolution of Pac-Man.

876
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,960
Championship edition is a fantastic evolution of a retro concept.

877
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,440
And so you're, yeah, you're, you're going down the right trail there for sure.

878
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,360
Pitfall 99.

879
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,980
I don't hate it.

880
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,340
I don't hate it.

881
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,900
Tiger claw says, how about mega mania?

882
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:56,000
You know, I read that at first as a mega man universe for some reason and what that game

883
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
could have been.

884
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,780
And I think that's a game a lot of us are sad never ended up happening.

885
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,780
That's for sure.

886
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:06,760
Um, so yeah, dark Tetsuya says, I wouldn't mind a modern rerelease of the 2,600 stuff.

887
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
Me neither.

888
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,440
And I think as long as they can still be a little bit cheeky about the fact that, you

889
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,000
know, this, these are Atari 2,600 games and kind of like Loki brought up with his, uh,

890
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,080
YouTube criticism of his game that didn't understand that it's a retro inspired game.

891
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,080
Yes.

892
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,920
It is kind of the same game loop over and over type of thing.

893
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,760
As long as it doesn't like try to break some of those things that made those old games

894
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,760
work.

895
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,760
I think it could be fine.

896
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,240
And by the way, how has nobody mentioned Keystone capers yet?

897
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,280
Thank you very much.

898
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:43,560
So that's the Activision franchise I'd like to see, but yes, hexen, um, and guitar hero.

899
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,560
I think it would be great.

900
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,000
Like hexen done, like the new doom games that'd be amazing.

901
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,240
Oh my God.

902
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,240
Yes.

903
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,840
I think, I think really that's at the top.

904
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:57,080
I mean, you know, I love me some retro, but I think a new hexen in the style of new doom

905
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,320
is like at the top of my list.

906
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,520
I would love to see that.

907
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,520
I really would.

908
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,200
Um, and as a music game lover, of course, I'd love to see guitar hero come back.

909
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,720
And I think it's, we've, we've reached this really interesting place where now that everybody's

910
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,320
gotten, not everybody, but a lot of people have gotten rid of their plastic guitars and

911
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,400
plastic instruments and that whole thing, and they've unloaded regards.

912
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,840
Now people want them again and nobody makes them.

913
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,800
Um, and they're harder to get and maybe that's, and I think it was even kind of cited that

914
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,920
Activision was hoping maybe Microsoft would have the means to bring the peripherals for

915
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,320
those types of games back and maybe make a modern type of guitar hero, which obviously

916
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,320
I'm all about that.

917
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,520
I would, um, I would really love that Microsoft doesn't shy away from very large controllers.

918
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
So why not?

919
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:50,200
Um, SSG100 Matt says, I mean that tiny Tina's wonderlands game is going to scratch that

920
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,200
hex and itch.

921
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,200
Yeah.

922
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,960
It's part of why that game looks appealing, honestly.

923
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,960
So, um, yeah.

924
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,000
So yeah, I, I, I, I'm all about old franchises coming back, but I think we also need to be

925
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,540
a little bit measured about it.

926
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,560
They're not going to come back for some time.

927
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,380
Uh, this deal hasn't even closed yet.

928
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:14,760
It's going to be a while, a while, uh, and maybe, uh, in fact, we might even be talking

929
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:21,400
about Xbox series Y or Z or whatever the hell they come up with next that these sorts of

930
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,140
things start happening for.

931
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:29,120
So just, uh, it's going to be a little while, but me, I don't know at the same time, Blizzard

932
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:35,960
making a King's quest game, I I'm kind of into it.

933
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Let's see.

934
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Let's see.

935
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,960
Let's see what they got.

936
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,200
You know, somebody might have to research this for me.

937
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,080
I'm sorry.

938
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:51,940
Doesn't didn't Sierra come back as an indie brand for Activision because there was a geometry

939
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,400
Wars three.

940
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,560
Remember?

941
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:00,400
It was a few years ago and it was Sierra online that put it out, but it was like a rebranded

942
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,060
Sierra because obviously they did not do the King's quest.

943
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,520
Somebody else kind of got the rights to make that game.

944
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
Okay.

945
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,520
Okay.

946
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
So that is right.

947
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,520
Sierra entertainment is an indie brand for active.

948
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,040
Oh, they did make the new King's quest.

949
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,580
No, I thought that was another studio.

950
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,580
Maybe they published it.

951
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,880
Probably another studio made it and they published it, but yeah, they did the cause I know geometry

952
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,180
Wars three was like one of their first games.

953
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,420
Now that is like the label.

954
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:29,780
I would like, I would like to see a pitfall or a Keystone capers and all that shit we

955
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,340
were talking about earlier with that type of approach in mind, like they did geometry

956
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,340
Wars three.

957
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:39,420
I just don't know how well geometry Wars three sold if there's that incentive to do it, but

958
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:44,300
I'm hoping Phil Spencer, uh, will, will have a different approach to it.

959
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,300
I really do.

960
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,300
So, all right.

961
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,420
Meanwhile, let's talk about Sony.

962
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,760
We've been very quiet on the Sony front, but we should talk about what's going on at the

963
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,760
house of Sony.

964
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,980
And, um, you know, we haven't talked a lot about what this whole Microsoft maneuver might

965
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,500
mean for them.

966
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,340
And I think in a big way, it really lights a fire under their ass to compete with game

967
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,800
pass because I think Phil Spencer is absolutely playing the long game.

968
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,740
And I think it's a game about game pass.

969
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,420
Um, and PlayStation so far doesn't really have a response to that.

970
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,060
Although definitely it seems like the clouds have been brewing, right?

971
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,500
We talked about the PlayStation now cards and some of that, that all changed.

972
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:27,900
Well, guess what else happened this last week, a small selection of PlayStation three games

973
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:34,740
priced even showed up on the PlayStation five store, uh, titles in the dead or alive and

974
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:39,440
Prince of Persia, Persia franchises, uh, were showing up.

975
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,100
Those games are on PlayStation now, but they shouldn't have been separate titles available

976
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:54,280
on PlayStation five, unless maybe, I mean, we have cloud games on switch, maybe Sony's

977
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,080
either plotting cloud games or they have found a way to do backwards compatibility.

978
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,360
There was a, there was rumblings of a new Mark Cerny patent.

979
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,540
I think, uh, last week or the week before that may have cracked the code when it comes

980
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:12,440
to backwards compatibility, that cracking of code requires me to purchase the game again.

981
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,860
That doesn't sound like something I'm interested in and hopefully, cause I remember they did

982
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:23,340
that like PlayStation three, I guess some of that it's in the realm of possibility where

983
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,660
they could just say, Oh, you purchased it before.

984
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:34,020
Now you get access to it, but this is Sony and they would be like, well, but we, we upscaled

985
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,020
it.

986
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,020
So now it's a new game.

987
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,020
You have to re-buy it.

988
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,180
Like Sony's going to give Microsoft a free weapon.

989
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:43,520
If they do that, if they don't allow the disc based stuff to, at least the digital

990
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,680
catalog has to roll over.

991
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,680
Like the disc stuff.

992
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,680
I get it.

993
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,680
That might be a limitation.

994
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,680
They just can't do it.

995
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:55,160
But I mean, if one company can do it, I think they should be able to do it, but let's just

996
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,760
say, okay, they can't do it.

997
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,600
But if I purchase that on the PlayStation three store and I have it in my catalog, which

998
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:05,680
all that's still in my PlayStation network account, then in theory, that should be just

999
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,020
unlocked for me when it's available.

1000
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:12,040
But I, I'm not holding my breath for that.

1001
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,040
Yeah.

1002
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,840
I still, you know, obviously I want to see backwards compatibility as well, but we don't

1003
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,840
know anything official.

1004
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,300
There was some weird like commercial thing that had today's date with the retro and people

1005
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:27,060
thought that it looked like it really just was a new commercial and nothing about backwards

1006
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,060
compatibility.

1007
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:33,740
Um, so, or maybe Sony was going to say something, but they got the rug pulled under him with

1008
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,980
this announcement this week.

1009
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,980
I don't know.

1010
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:39,700
Um, so, you know, more, more to develop perhaps on this.

1011
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:46,660
Uh, but I, I think GDC, although we don't usually have these huge types of announcements

1012
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:49,540
at GDC, it's not for that.

1013
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:54,740
I could see them kind of dropping that hint there, but I don't know, maybe something soon.

1014
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:58,140
I mean, Sony is perfectly capable of just pushing out a state of play whenever they

1015
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,180
want, uh, to talk about this.

1016
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:04,140
So we'll see who knows, um, before we get to our next story.

1017
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,740
I want to go back cause chat is talking about this.

1018
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,820
They're still stuck on the Activision, uh, retro properties.

1019
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:18,020
Mike Deft in chat says, get playground studios who does Forza to make a new blur.

1020
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,740
Oh, that'd be amazing.

1021
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,740
Hmm.

1022
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:28,780
Look y'all, I don't want to be weird, but like, I'm a little horny thinking about that.

1023
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,220
That is actually a little weird, Rob.

1024
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,220
I'm sorry.

1025
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:39,260
The makers of Forza are doing a new blur, a little bit H word, a little bit H word.

1026
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,260
All right.

1027
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,260
Moving on.

1028
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,260
Darcy, what do you have for us?

1029
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:54,260
Um, well, uh, Moki hinted to this earlier, but, um, going back to the Activision Blizzard

1030
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,820
side of things, they have formed their first union.

1031
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,580
Well, the company didn't, but employees did.

1032
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:06,100
Um, actually technically employees at Raven software, which is owned by Activision Blizzard.

1033
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,660
Um, they formed a union.

1034
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:13,620
Um, it is, uh, made up of about 60 employees.

1035
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:19,340
Um, and it, of course they made their announcement just after, uh, Microsoft announcing that

1036
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,500
they were going to acquire Activision Blizzard.

1037
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Um, actually I take that back.

1038
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:30,380
It's uh, the union is, uh, I mean, the union, yeah, it's a very small one, but it's

1039
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:39,420
very significant in the fact that this is one of the first unions at a major developer

1040
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,820
relatively.

1041
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:49,700
Um, this actually came to, uh, to fruition after, um, they had their walkout to protest,

1042
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,220
uh, the layoffs of contract workers that they said were unfair.

1043
00:57:53,220 --> 00:58:00,420
Um, so they are wanting to have the changes in the company reflect the wants and needs

1044
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:05,220
of the gaming community and the workers that create the product that's, uh, stated by a

1045
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,260
quality assurance employee named Brent Real.

1046
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:14,540
Um, so the union is called the Game Workers Alliance union, um, again, the first at a

1047
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:20,540
publicly traded video game publisher and the second video game union in the US.

1048
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:25,020
It's going to be part of the Communications Workers of America, which is the largest union

1049
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,500
in the media industry.

1050
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:36,940
Um, so, uh, there are, it's going to be, it's a pretty big deal and hopefully it's going

1051
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:42,140
to, to spread, you know, start, start a bigger trend.

1052
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:48,340
Um, and on top of that, they're wanting to make sure that overall that they're really

1053
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,380
just improving the conditions.

1054
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:55,140
Um, they, um, they're waiting for the company to recognize them.

1055
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,820
They have until the 25th.

1056
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:04,220
So for us, that's two days from now to, uh, to, uh, recognize them or else there's probably

1057
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:07,140
going to be something big coming up.

1058
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:13,980
Um, and the only thing that Activation Blizzard ever did after that issue happened is that

1059
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:19,820
they raised their minimum compensation for Raven, um, for their QA employees and a few

1060
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:25,860
other benefits, but they really didn't do too terribly much, so that's it.

1061
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:30,300
It is kind of interesting, you know, because, uh, obviously my head kind of went to, oh,

1062
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,820
I wonder what the, you know, a better ABK folks think about, you know, everything that's

1063
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:38,880
happened with the Microsoft purchase and certainly I wasn't going to expect that like, oh, well,

1064
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,580
they've just magically dropped all their grievances.

1065
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:45,300
It is nice to see that the fight kind of continues in that regard.

1066
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,900
I think it will be very interesting to see what Microsoft sort of response is to this.

1067
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:54,900
And it seems so far their response is just radio silence, which honestly is the smart

1068
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,900
thing to do.

1069
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:01,180
Um, and in regards to that with the whole, you know, looming, uh, going under the microscope

1070
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,560
with the antitrust and everything like that, um, it's going to be very interesting if Bobby

1071
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:10,260
Kotick's legacy is, you know, all my workers unionized once I sold this company type of

1072
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:15,580
thing, uh, is going to be interesting, but obviously I, I still fully support these folks

1073
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,580
and wanting to unionize.

1074
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,860
It makes sense.

1075
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:23,340
You know, they, they've seen how bad it can get, uh, they've hit the bottom and they don't

1076
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,220
want to ever go back there and they want to unionize to make sure a company can't take

1077
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,220
them there.

1078
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,220
So who can blame them?

1079
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,780
Whether it's Microsoft or even, you know, what's, what's like the most loved gaming

1080
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:36,300
company in the world, probably Nintendo, maybe, I don't know, even if Nintendo bought them,

1081
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,940
I wouldn't expect that this fight would stop.

1082
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:43,340
So, um, I think, I think that's, that's, that's pretty neat.

1083
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,340
So, um, we'll see what happens.

1084
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:49,780
One thing that happens with any sort of acquisition is that you can't just go in and make a huge

1085
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:54,140
overhaul and expect success out of the business.

1086
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:57,900
I mean, I think that that's what a lot of companies make the mistake of doing.

1087
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:05,460
It's going, an overhaul is needed, but I think it's going to have to come a bit more fluidly,

1088
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,460
if that makes sense.

1089
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,460
Yeah.

1090
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,460
Yeah.

1091
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:12,060
The reality is this deal still won't be finalized for what a year and a half.

1092
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,420
And that's a long time.

1093
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:17,780
And so, you know what, these unions could be up running and in place throughout Activision

1094
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,380
Blizzard in that time.

1095
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,180
So we'll see.

1096
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,620
But I feel Spencer doesn't strike me as the type that's like, I'm going to shut it down

1097
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,620
or whatever.

1098
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:31,780
And, uh, you know, Microsoft does not seem to have the same, um, union busting within

1099
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,440
its ranks.

1100
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,580
I thought it was very interesting, by the way, we didn't talk about this earlier, but

1101
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:40,500
when Microsoft made that announcement, they posted a picture of their leadership.

1102
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,500
Interesting.

1103
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,220
It wasn't Activision Blizzard or any of them, but Microsoft's leadership.

1104
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:50,060
And it was very much to show, look how many women are in the structure.

1105
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:54,260
And it was definitely flexing that, which is a good thing, but it's, I think in a way

1106
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,780
it's also flexing.

1107
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,620
Look who's not here is Frances Townsend or whatever her name is, the union busting one.

1108
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:04,540
And I really think that was the kind of flex that like, this is the team that's going to

1109
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:05,540
run this.

1110
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:09,580
Um, and we don't have the same attitudes, so be interesting.

1111
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:10,580
Interesting.

1112
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,580
All right.

1113
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:14,380
Moving on in the mobile world, Loki.

1114
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,380
Yes.

1115
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:23,100
Uh, so Pokemon Go has halted trading because apparently there was a bug in Pokemon Go that

1116
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:27,580
was allowing the lucky Pokemon, which I think is like, was it like 50 50?

1117
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:32,380
Um, I don't remember what the percentage is that you get a lucky Pokemon on trade, but

1118
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:35,700
apparently it was unusually high.

1119
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:40,420
And so there was, um, a Reddit post where someone was able to get a hundred lucky Pokemon

1120
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:45,140
in a very short span of time, that's supposed to be statistically impossible.

1121
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:51,980
Um, and so now they're Niantic is investigating the issue because you can't have your lucky

1122
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:52,980
Pokemon.

1123
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,660
Well, there's a follow up to what you're reading.

1124
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,220
It's it's back on again.

1125
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,300
They've resolved whatever it was.

1126
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,300
Yeah.

1127
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:03,500
Just I think just in time for the community day, I did mention it during my gaming week.

1128
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,180
I tried to do community day.

1129
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,340
Um, I did the Pikmin one.

1130
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:10,120
I walked to my 10,000 steps and we were doing an Ingers thing, a little minor thing for

1131
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,120
that.

1132
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,320
Um, but, uh, I was doing a Pokemon later in the day.

1133
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,560
I only caught one shot.

1134
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,980
I just don't have luck with Bulbasaur.

1135
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,820
I caught one shiny Bulbasaur.

1136
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:19,820
That's it.

1137
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:24,340
And I had like two, uh, so at least I have three now, but, uh, it wasn't a very good

1138
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,460
IV one.

1139
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:29,620
But the problem was I couldn't go pedal to the hours were bad.

1140
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,480
It was only two to five.

1141
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:36,020
They didn't run at the six hour window and I was hosting an event that started at five.

1142
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:40,260
So like I had to be done by like three 30 so I could get ready for the event I was hosting

1143
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,260
last night.

1144
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:44,220
So I'm just kind of a bummer on the timing again.

1145
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:49,460
So whatever, but at least I can do lucky trades.

1146
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,900
All right, moving on.

1147
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,440
Let's talk about, I had brought up cloud gaming earlier in the show.

1148
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,840
Let's talk about Sora gaming.

1149
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:02,480
Uh, let's talk about Kingdom Hearts.

1150
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:07,640
Kingdom Hearts is coming out for the switch and there was a trailer that was unveiled

1151
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,600
that shows it will be out on February 10th.

1152
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:15,340
It is important to note these Kingdom Hearts games are cloud versions.

1153
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:19,420
So you're going to be playing them on the cloud, which is not new for the switch.

1154
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,520
There have been other game releases for that.

1155
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,740
So you do need a consistent internet to play.

1156
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:28,420
So my internet after 7.15, which by the way is in a minute, so cross your fingers and

1157
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:33,120
toes and hold your breath, is probably not as reliable for that.

1158
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:39,980
But for most people that have decent internet connections in the city and what have you,

1159
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,100
it might be a way to play these games.

1160
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:50,300
I kind of think this is a little late and it makes more sense in Japan perhaps.

1161
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:54,420
But I guess there might be some people here that want to get into it, especially, I don't

1162
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,900
know, maybe if the switch is the only one in your house because you have younger folks

1163
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:58,900
and what have you.

1164
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:03,020
I mean, I do get the logic behind it, but I just, I don't see this exactly being the

1165
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:08,500
hot cake seller that I think it would have been some time ago.

1166
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,660
Now, there will be a demo.

1167
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:14,280
In fact, it's actually out now if you want to try that on the eShop.

1168
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,400
They are also cloud versions.

1169
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,180
So I will give it that.

1170
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:23,060
You have free reign to test this and see what you think about the cloud gaming on the switch.

1171
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:26,780
So you can make your own judgment on how your internet behaves and if it's the way you want

1172
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,980
to play or not.

1173
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,700
I think Control was one of the other games that did this.

1174
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:35,740
It had a demo on the shop and was a cloud game ultimately at the end of the day.

1175
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:40,500
There's also going to be a Kingdom Hearts 20th anniversary celebration stream that will

1176
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,420
happen on April 10th.

1177
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,300
Who knows if they'll announce anything special with that.

1178
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,300
I don't know if you want to get your hopes up too much with that.

1179
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:51,940
I don't think we're, well, I don't know.

1180
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:55,740
Over under on a Kingdom Hearts 4, folks?

1181
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:56,900
It won't be 4.

1182
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,900
That's too normal.

1183
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,460
Oh yeah, you're right.

1184
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:12,140
We need Kingdom Hearts 3, Remind, Remaster, Redone, Under, 2-4 for Destiny's Kiss edition.

1185
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:16,460
They'll have like some big like long calculus equation as part of the title.

1186
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:20,580
Yeah, for Dancing Stage.

1187
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:21,580
True Kiss Destination.

1188
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:22,580
All right.

1189
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:23,580
Anyway, we'll see.

1190
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,260
We'll see what happens with that.

1191
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:30,180
But I would say they're not, they're not going to do a stream on April 10th and not announce

1192
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,180
anything.

1193
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:37,820
It could be as simple as that horrible theater them successor that they did.

1194
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:38,820
I'm sorry.

1195
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:39,820
I did not like that game.

1196
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:42,940
I think they're going to do a new one of those that I'm supposed to get excited about.

1197
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,460
But we'll see.

1198
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:49,660
What do y'all in chat think over twitch.tv slash vog network?

1199
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:57,300
E3VL points out Kingdom Hearts all in one for PS4 usually goes for $30 versus the amount

1200
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,060
that this is going to cost on the Switch.

1201
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,580
That's a very good point as well.

1202
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:01,580
That's sure.

1203
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:06,620
So if people don't have the other consoles, they'll pay what they want.

1204
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:12,700
Especially if it's something like get their kids on the game or something, you know.

1205
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,700
All right.

1206
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,700
Moving on.

1207
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,820
Dark Soccer, you have a good industry story, right?

1208
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:18,820
I do.

1209
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:26,780
So there was a survey that came out of the game developers conference where they did

1210
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,180
their 10th edition state of the game industry.

1211
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:33,220
That was, I believe, last Thursday.

1212
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:39,100
But they pulled more than 2700 developers across a series of topics.

1213
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:45,580
And so 62 percent of the responders said their companies did nothing to engage with conversations

1214
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:50,080
around misconduct and toxicity.

1215
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:54,540
They said also some respondents said that their companies don't have these problems,

1216
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,700
but mostly because they were too small or they weren't based in the U.S. or their companies

1217
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:03,420
had a zero tolerance policy or it wasn't something that they witnessed.

1218
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:04,420
There was a yes.

1219
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:09,820
But they said that in that survey, 38 percent of respondents said that their employees did

1220
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,900
take action.

1221
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:18,020
And it is a growing trend in workplaces in the industry to have some initiative to root

1222
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,140
out toxicity.

1223
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:29,020
So what they're basically saying is, I mean, some of them are saying that it's a very North

1224
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:39,220
American focus, but a lot of people are really just unhappy with how their leadership responds.

1225
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:43,780
Some of the comments say they bury it, pretend it isn't a problem, they act like it's different.

1226
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:47,300
There continue to be people harassed and silenced.

1227
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,540
I've had to force them to make internal statements.

1228
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:53,540
We were affected by the Blizzard misconduct and we opted to say nothing.

1229
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:57,500
My faith in big companies to do the right thing is non-existent.

1230
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,620
Another quote, no one is surprised by misconduct.

1231
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:04,500
We've seen it or experienced it in some form or another in our career.

1232
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,180
Our companies spoke to trying to do better.

1233
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:12,660
They started creating classes and inviting speakers to inform and educate people.

1234
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:17,460
They have another survey, according to the survey, actually, this is 23 percent of developers

1235
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:22,500
polled said unions, talks have taken place at their studio and a lot of people say that

1236
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,500
it's needed.

1237
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:29,100
Fifty-five percent of respondents say that they should unionize, but there are some that

1238
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:34,580
are still, you know, resisting it, but that's the general consensus is that there needs

1239
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:37,540
to be more done to combat toxicity.

1240
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:44,780
It's not happening, but it's starting to happen more, but it's not enough and that more people

1241
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,900
are interested in unionizing.

1242
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:53,540
Yeah, and, you know, it's it just goes to kind of underline and score when these Blizzard

1243
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:59,020
Activision issues first came up that, you know, this was this is not a problem unique

1244
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,020
to them.

1245
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:05,580
It was definitely exacerbated by them and, you know, enabled by Bobby Kotick, et cetera.

1246
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,300
But you know, we've known that this is an issue throughout the industry.

1247
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,220
You know, obviously, you've heard everything about Ubisoft and plenty, plenty, plenty of

1248
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,220
other places.

1249
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,260
What happened to Riot Games previously, et cetera, et cetera.

1250
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,660
List goes on and on and on.

1251
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:21,860
So I think this, you know, survey sort of just underscores the fact that a lot of these

1252
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:25,180
problems are an industry problem.

1253
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:31,120
And any leader of any game company, big, small, medium sized, should really be evaluating

1254
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:37,540
some of the policies when it comes to investigating these sorts of issues and maybe passively

1255
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:44,180
enabling some of these issues, which I think is happening way too far off than is the case.

1256
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:56,460
Well, silence and refusal to do anything is almost like a nonverbal endorsement.

1257
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,460
Yeah.

1258
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:04,500
That for the people who don't say anything and don't do anything, you are by your inaction

1259
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:08,620
endorsing this behavior because it's not, in your mind, bad enough to say something

1260
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,960
about it.

1261
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,580
And I think that's, you're complicit.

1262
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:16,220
I think that's a real element of what's been happening in so many of these game companies

1263
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:21,180
for far too long is it's just like, oh, those are personal issues we don't want to get into

1264
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:27,300
or deal with or it's, you know, but it's, you know, there's definitely been a gross

1265
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:33,120
culture in the industry for a long, long time underscored by what E3 used to look like when

1266
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,800
we first started going.

1267
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,320
I have an analogy, actually.

1268
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,320
Sure.

1269
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:45,120
So if you imagine somebody who, say, has an illness or has like, OK, we're going to say

1270
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,400
someone has a drinking problem, we're just going to start that.

1271
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:55,160
And maybe at first things seem kind of fun, you know, kind of, oh, we're loose, everything

1272
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,720
is great here.

1273
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:02,280
And then they start having like a little bit of a liver problem or their skin gets bad.

1274
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:08,160
But they're not willing to do what it takes to fix those issues by taking care of the

1275
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,200
core issue, which is the drinking, you know.

1276
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,180
And so after a while, they start going into liver failure.

1277
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:19,480
They start having all these other issues happen.

1278
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,480
Things around them start going to shit.

1279
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,080
And we're seeing that in companies.

1280
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:30,380
It's kind of the same thing where, just use the biggest elephant.

1281
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:37,820
We have Activision Blizzard who things internally have gone so much to shit that they're being

1282
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:45,500
acquired and companies around them are now affected by this, having to take a deep, hard

1283
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,500
look.

1284
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:51,340
They're being scrutinized because of the type of behavior that they're endorsing.

1285
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,500
It's all just that cycle.

1286
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:57,300
Yeah, good analogy.

1287
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,660
I can think of more, but we'll just get to our next.

1288
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:00,660
I think that was a good analogy.

1289
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:01,660
We'll leave it at that.

1290
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:05,020
So let's get to our next story.

1291
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:08,980
Speaking of things that are ugly and dark-sided, Loki.

1292
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,200
Yeah.

1293
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,780
So we talked about this.

1294
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:18,660
Not you, but what you're going to talk about, just to be clear, I meet that description.

1295
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:24,880
But we were talking about another dark-sided evil person by the name of Ruben Sim, who

1296
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:32,400
was banned from Roblox for apparently leading cyber mobs to harass the player base.

1297
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,400
He was also...

1298
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,760
Can we think about that statement for a minute too?

1299
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,380
Banned by Roblox?

1300
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,760
Can we just marinate in that for a minute?

1301
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,760
Yeah.

1302
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,360
Well, there's more to it though.

1303
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,560
Remember, he also called in bomb threats to...

1304
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,680
Oh, my God, this is the same guy?

1305
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,680
Yeah.

1306
01:13:53,680 --> 01:14:02,880
So apparently, according to the Oakland, California export, he had been issued, I guess, apparently

1307
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,080
he was supposed to be not going back on Roblox.

1308
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,600
They tried to ban him.

1309
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,640
He was also charged $160,000 for damages.

1310
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:22,160
Well, apparently, because it's a free-to-play game, he is circumventing their IP bans by

1311
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:30,200
getting other people to create accounts for him, or I'm assuming the VPNs, perhaps.

1312
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:36,760
So he has been continually logging into Roblox and continuing his false threats of terrorism

1313
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,160
activity relating to Roblox.

1314
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:49,000
And also, apparently, he is supposed to be not able to gain access to the platform, not

1315
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,160
make false statements about the game and its employees or go near its offices, post

1316
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:58,160
or republish those threats as well.

1317
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:06,480
And apparently, he is now forced into a temporary lockdown while local police and private security

1318
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,880
conducted a search of a secure facility.

1319
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,400
I guess he had made some more threats regarding the developers conference.

1320
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:19,080
I don't know if there's anything more they could really do to keep him off the platform

1321
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,240
if it's so easy for him to get back on there.

1322
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,280
Why isn't he in jail is what I want to know.

1323
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:30,040
I'm reminded of this meme I've seen on the internet of, I'm trying to get it to come

1324
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,560
up here, I'm reminded of this meme I've seen online on the internet of Baby Bop holding

1325
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,440
a stop sign saying, basically saying, you need to stop.

1326
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,200
And that is what I think somebody needs to send this person in the mail or some other

1327
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,920
way to tell this person that they really need to stop.

1328
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,920
This is beyond the point of ridiculousness.

1329
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:57,080
So apparently, he has a huge following on YouTube and he's still posting videos on this

1330
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,080
thing as well.

1331
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,480
And YouTube needs to start taking his channel down.

1332
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,600
I agree with that too, for sure.

1333
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:09,120
Well, Roblox is suing him for $1.6 million, so this should hopefully get him the stop.

1334
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,200
I think that there's something wrong with this guy.

1335
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:12,800
Do you think?

1336
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,520
Well, if nothing else, maybe a lawsuit will finally shut him up.

1337
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,080
I doubt it.

1338
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,440
Well, yeah, it's true.

1339
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,960
Now, it'll just be YouTube's about the lawsuit, but I do agree YouTube should probably

1340
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,000
deplatform him so he can yell and scream into the void.

1341
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,320
All right.

1342
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,400
Well, lots of people have been yelling and screaming in the YouTube void about the

1343
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:41,440
Nintendo Switch Online emulator and how it wasn't very good for certain Nintendo 64

1344
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:45,320
games, which kind of sucks when Nintendo's charging a premium.

1345
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:50,160
And people honestly thought that, well, we'll probably just have to deal with this

1346
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,600
forever because when's Nintendo going to bother to patch these emulators?

1347
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,400
Well, plot twist.

1348
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,960
It turns out Nintendo patched the emulator.

1349
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:05,120
So Nintendo, I think they just put out this week was Banjo-Kazooie this week.

1350
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:10,800
Yeah, so Banjo-Kazooie just came out as part of the N64 library on January 20th.

1351
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,120
So that added to the library.

1352
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:17,080
And by the way, Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask is coming in February.

1353
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:20,200
So, you know, adding new games is not unheard of.

1354
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,120
And we knew some of those were coming.

1355
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:26,720
But what's interesting is that when they and I think they've done this too, is that, you

1356
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:32,320
know, that Nintendo Online application is basically an all in one app that they just

1357
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,040
add the new games into it.

1358
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,000
I don't think it's like talking to a server or anything like that.

1359
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,920
I think they're just patching that game over and over.

1360
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:43,440
So or patching that executable or whatever you want to call it over and over with the

1361
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,800
new games. Well, it turns out they actually patched the emulator as a part of this too.

1362
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:53,320
It was spotted on Twitter that the Nintendo 64 emulator does a better job at displaying

1363
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,200
water in the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

1364
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:02,760
The fog is still missing, but it sounds like the water temple is like actually playable

1365
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,880
now at this point, whereas in the emulator as it stood before, it was virtually

1366
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:13,720
unplayable. So I think it's worth noting Nintendo is updating the emulator, not just

1367
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:18,840
with new games, but fixing and addressing some of these issues, even if it's not perfect

1368
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:25,640
yet. E3VL in chat asks, they have a roadmap now just for the next month or two.

1369
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,760
Just we know that Majora's Mask is coming, but we don't really know beyond that.

1370
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,000
We've had a bunch of shit teased in the trailer, but we don't know exactly when those

1371
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,120
games are coming out. But it is nice to see someone fix that.

1372
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:42,280
So someone is assigned to making the emulator better or trying to work on some of these

1373
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:47,040
issues. So that is refreshing to see, because I think many of us were kind of resigned to

1374
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:52,040
the fact that Nintendo was not going to do shit about shit with it, with the emulator

1375
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,240
and just take your money and laugh with it all the way to the bank.

1376
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:59,800
So it is nice to see Nintendo should be applauded for doing the right thing.

1377
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,840
So I will give them one clap.

1378
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,000
Here we go. There you go.

1379
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,280
One clap for doing the right thing in this circumstance.

1380
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:12,240
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh, so you can beat the water temple?

1381
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,240
I kid, although I didn't do it until a few years ago.

1382
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,120
Well, it's a little easier now for sure.

1383
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:23,520
SG100Matt in chat says, no Super Nintendo or NES Nintendo online updates.

1384
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,120
What?

1385
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,520
What a shot.

1386
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:31,520
I thought we were paying all of this money and this expansion passes and stuff, and I'm

1387
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,160
not getting more content.

1388
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,880
I am so surprised.

1389
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:41,880
You mean the base level Nintendo online people are getting jack and shit now?

1390
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,440
I am so shocked.

1391
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:50,960
This is totally new information that was unexpected.

1392
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,240
Got some vital information.

1393
01:19:54,520 --> 01:20:02,680
All right, maybe, maybe we need our next segment and a time when things weren't so complicated.

1394
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,960
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1395
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,840
out a classic and tell you about it.

1396
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,960
It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

1397
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:29,960
And Dark Sakura, what did you pick for episode 900's Classic Game of the Week?

1398
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:31,760
Pick Dear Esther.

1399
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:41,720
Dear Esther is a first person exploration game developed by the Chinese Room.

1400
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:47,600
It came out for Windows OS X, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1401
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:54,440
It was released in 2008 as a free to play mod for the Source game engine.

1402
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:00,720
And then it was redeveloped entirely for a commercial release in 2012.

1403
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,160
It is a very minimalistic game.

1404
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,480
You basically just explore.

1405
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:13,760
It's an island in Scotland and you listen to a man who is reading a series of letters to

1406
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,920
his, excuse me, deceased wife.

1407
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,800
And then you learn about how she died over the course of the exploration.

1408
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:30,120
This is the same company, by the way, that did Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, just so

1409
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:36,360
that, you know, in 2017, they did an updated version called Dear Esther Landmark Edition

1410
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,960
that was released based in Unity.

1411
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:49,200
Anyway, like I said, you explore this island, listening to the man reading a series of letter

1412
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:55,120
fragments to Esther, his deceased wife, and you reach new locations in the game.

1413
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,280
And that plays a letter fragment that relates to that area.

1414
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:05,880
The different fragments are revealed in each playthrough of the game.

1415
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,280
So you get a slightly different narrative each time.

1416
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,880
Several other characters are referred to by the narrator.

1417
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,440
You have a man named Donnelly who charted the island.

1418
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:21,200
Paul, who is the drunk driver that suggested, was involved in Esther's death.

1419
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:26,280
A shepherd named Jacobson who lived on the island in the 18th century.

1420
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:31,400
And then you find these remains of buildings, a shipwreck, a cave system.

1421
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,760
The cave system is my favorite part of this game, by the way.

1422
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,560
And you get you see like different images on the cave walls that have like chemical

1423
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,360
diagrams, circuit diagrams, neurons, bacteria, different things like that.

1424
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:48,200
And you also see a figure walking away in the distance, but they vanish before you can

1425
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:52,120
find them. And it does have a little bit of an ambiguous ending to it.

1426
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,640
It is a very beautiful game.

1427
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:05,680
I think that it's really absolutely worth everyone playing through at least once.

1428
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:11,840
But to go back into the development history of this game, it was a source engine mod

1429
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,240
that was developed by the Chinese room.

1430
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,120
Well, they were part of a research project for the University of Portsmouth.

1431
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:22,760
They were funded by a grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and it was

1432
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:27,200
led by Dan Pinchbeck, who is a professor at the university.

1433
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:36,080
He developed the story and the script and he cited the works of William S. Burroughs

1434
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:43,760
in the writing, particularly to the way it would be image heavy and symbolic.

1435
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,800
So, you know, trying to do a different sort of narrative.

1436
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:59,040
So basically, an independent game artist named Robert Briscoe worked on redeveloping

1437
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,880
Dear Esther in 2009 under Pinchecks support.

1438
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:11,160
So he in the Chinese room worked on the remake with redoing some of the level design

1439
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:14,640
and using concept art by a man named Ben Andrews.

1440
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,200
They redesigned the game's landscape, they tried to remove some of the confusion with

1441
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:27,080
the original layout and make the environment richer and more compelling instead of just

1442
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,840
completely barren landscape in the original.

1443
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:38,280
But the Chinese room lost their backing and then they ended up finding backing instead

1444
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:43,880
by the Indie Fund, who didn't really want to do it at first.

1445
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,520
After the demo, they're like, oh, this is cool.

1446
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,600
And they funded it.

1447
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:55,560
After so the game went through it, once they were playing it, people were like, oh,

1448
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,640
heck yeah, this is rad.

1449
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,560
Other people who were a bit iffy on it.

1450
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:07,160
So to let you know, once the game was released on Steam, within the first six

1451
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:12,600
hours, they sold 16000 units and it allowed the developers to pay back the Indie Fund

1452
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:21,800
investment. Their narrator was Nigel Carrington, who had an extended script for the

1453
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:28,520
remake. The music was done by Pinchbeck's wife, Jessica Curry, who's a freelance music

1454
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,520
composer and the co-director of the Chinese room.

1455
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:36,520
And then she completely overhauled and reorchestrated it for the commercial release,

1456
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:41,520
basically doubling the length of the original soundtrack, which the original game

1457
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,320
soundtrack was available on July 8th, 2008.

1458
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,440
And then there is a remastered soundtrack that was available as of February 14th, 2012

1459
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,160
on Amazon, iTunes and Bandcamp.

1460
01:25:53,560 --> 01:26:00,480
The original release of it was selected for the animation exhibition in the 2008

1461
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:06,760
Pre-Arts Electronica and made ModDB's top 100 mods of 2008.

1462
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:13,160
And in 2009, the game won award for Best World Story at Indie Arcade Independent Games

1463
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:23,360
Awards. It got a lot of praise and attached to emotions that not many people would

1464
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,360
address in the game like unhappiness.

1465
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:35,560
And as for the commercial release, it got some pretty great reviews, 75 out of 100 on

1466
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:40,720
Metacritic. There are people who are like, oh, is this a game or is this just a story

1467
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,640
that you participate in?

1468
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:49,720
Some people said that the story seemed pretty obscure and a little hard to follow.

1469
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:59,520
It got anywhere between really positive reviews and some slightly mediocre reviews,

1470
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,760
so it really depends on who you ask.

1471
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:10,760
The game was considered, though, a graphical masterpiece and that it also won at the

1472
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,760
Independent Games Festival in 2012.

1473
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:21,880
It received the prize for excellent in visual arts, awarded them the prize for best use of

1474
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,960
narrative in the 2012 awards.

1475
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:32,840
TIGA Games Industry Awards of 2012 gave it the Originality Award and Best Action

1476
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:37,400
Adventure Game, Best Visual Design, Best Audio Design, Best Debut Game, and it was

1477
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:42,000
nominated for five awards at the 9th British Academy Video Games Awards.

1478
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:46,880
As of September 2013, it sold over 850,000 copies.

1479
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,600
And there you go.

1480
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:57,680
Dear Esther, I played through this at work, like a few years ago.

1481
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:04,560
A lot of people in chat are doing the whole OMG because our criteria for the classic game

1482
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,320
of the week, if you are not aware, is a game needs to be at least 10 years old, which is

1483
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,720
funny because now we get a lot of games that are our show is older than them, but they

1484
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,320
still classify for classic game of the week.

1485
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:19,520
And yes, Dear Esther isn't just 10 years old folks, it's 14 years old.

1486
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,240
14 years old because I'm going by the original release date.

1487
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:31,760
However, it will be considered commercially 12 years old next month.

1488
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:38,680
And also, when you kind of talk about the whole, it was very critically polarizing.

1489
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:42,440
I think it really was the first of those walking simulator games.

1490
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,360
I think some people try to use that label as a negative.

1491
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,680
I look at it as a little bit more empowering.

1492
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,960
And I think those types of games are very divisive.

1493
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,720
I enjoy Dear Esther.

1494
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,800
I didn't enjoy it as much.

1495
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,040
I think it's beautiful.

1496
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:01,080
But I agree that the story is a little harder to follow than maybe when the Chinese room

1497
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:01,920
did their follow up.

1498
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:08,440
Everybody's gone to the rapture, which is probably one of the best video games I've

1499
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:12,920
played, which and I think that studio kind of fell apart, didn't they?

1500
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,760
No, they were purchased by Sumo.

1501
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,200
Oh, OK.

1502
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:23,520
And in 2020, they did a game called Little Orpheus, and it's actually an Apple arcade

1503
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,400
game, which I'm going to look into it.

1504
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:29,640
Honestly, in 2017, they also did a game called So Let Us Melt.

1505
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,240
But I didn't know about that one.

1506
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:37,400
I'm going to have to look that one up and see what kind of game it is.

1507
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:42,000
And yeah, the music, the music in this game is gorgeous, as was again, I hate to keep

1508
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,800
comparing it to everybody's gone to the rapture, but I'm going to because that was, you

1509
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,160
know, I'd heard of Dear Esther.

1510
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:51,000
I wasn't really motivated to look at it until I play.

1511
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,920
Everybody's gone to the rapture and just thought it was brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

1512
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,120
I will.

1513
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,120
This game is is gorgeous.

1514
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,200
If nothing else.

1515
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:04,760
Yes, go walk in it and just explore the environment, because even for being 2008 now,

1516
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,000
granted, I don't know if we're watching like a play through of like a remaster because I

1517
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,480
know they kind of upped it up a little bit when they did like the PS4 release and stuff.

1518
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:19,360
But even still, this game is gorgeous today and is worth looking at just for like Dark

1519
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,160
Soccer was talking about the cave system is really cool.

1520
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:24,640
In fact, those watching live on Twitch were seeing a little bit of that right now.

1521
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:29,760
But I love the way the clouds look and the sky looks like it's just such a damn good

1522
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,560
looking game. You just get a little Orpheus actually got really good reviews.

1523
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,040
For the record, and it is on Apple Arcade.

1524
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,440
And on top of that, it looks like the developers actually reply to the reviews.

1525
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,640
Oh, like Loki.

1526
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,800
Just all right.

1527
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,840
But all right.

1528
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:54,240
There it is, your classic game of the week, a good one, a little unexpected for for

1529
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,560
around nine hundred.

1530
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:00,120
But at the same time, it's it's such a genre starter.

1531
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,520
You know, it is I mean, a game is a very notable game.

1532
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:09,160
I mean, I'm actually tempted to do a new stream of that game.

1533
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:13,600
I've been thinking about it either that I was actually, you know, it's me, Holly.

1534
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,960
Oh, yeah, she's great.

1535
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,720
Yeah, well, she's doing some other kind of narrative games and I suggest it because

1536
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:22,600
she's playing Firewatch.

1537
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,480
Oh, OK. That's another good one.

1538
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,040
And I suggested everybody's gone to the rapture and she seemed really interested in

1539
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,160
because I honestly enough that game is is.

1540
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,600
Both of these games are masterpieces, in my opinion.

1541
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,960
Yeah, and again, I know it's been a while since I've advocated for this game on the

1542
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,400
show, so please let me take a moment.

1543
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,840
If you've never played, everybody's gone to the rapture.

1544
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:48,840
You really need to it is and it is not action packed.

1545
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,080
It is not shooty shooty bang bang.

1546
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:58,200
But it is like just the music, the environments, the story is so good.

1547
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,720
Like I have a clamp just thinking about it.

1548
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:00,680
That game is so good.

1549
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,880
So it's just I want more more.

1550
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,080
It's it's art.

1551
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,320
It's art, mama.

1552
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,800
It's art. But is it art?

1553
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,560
It's art. All right.

1554
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,480
Indeed. All right.

1555
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:15,280
Let's move on with some other quick headlines here in the segment we call Rapid Fire News.

1556
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,880
Loki. Yeah.

1557
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:20,760
So there is a program called Playdate Pulp, which is out of beta.

1558
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:27,200
It is a game making development tool that you can use for the play date, which is that

1559
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:32,600
kind of handheld monochrome console with the crank on the side that I don't know when

1560
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:37,000
that's coming out. But if you want to make games for it, you can check it out for free.

1561
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,360
So that's pretty awesome.

1562
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:40,880
It looks neat.

1563
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,040
I'd be curious to see what I could do with it, but I don't have a play date to play any

1564
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:51,240
of this on. So I don't know what I would do with it, but it's kind of all in one.

1565
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:56,360
So if you're interested in check it out at play date slash pulp.

1566
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:04,680
And then we have news that Dying Light 2 will include a free PlayStation 5 and Xbox

1567
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:13,040
Series X update or upgrade since they're going to be shipping, I guess, with I don't know

1568
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:18,240
if those are coming out at the same time, but apparently, yeah, if you pick it up, you're

1569
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:21,120
going to be able to get those updates.

1570
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,040
So that's kind of cool.

1571
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:29,400
And then they're going to have three different rendering modes, and they've got a quality

1572
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,360
and resolution mode.

1573
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:36,360
So I'm guessing that the quality is going to add ray tracing and then resolution will

1574
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:40,600
be at 4K performance is going to be rendering at 60 FPS.

1575
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:50,680
So you can pick one, you give it more resolution, ray tracing, FPS, pick one.

1576
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,320
I think FPS is going to win out, though.

1577
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:57,120
I did want to before I get to Dark Soccer's headlines, Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out

1578
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:00,360
about the Playdate pulp that there is a Playdate emulator with that.

1579
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,760
So it's a way for you to play those games if you'd like.

1580
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:03,800
So there is that.

1581
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:08,520
All right. And dark Tetsuya said, oh, darn, I was going to ask when the Pixel Poops number

1582
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,280
two port was coming to the Playdate.

1583
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,040
So I guess I guess another time.

1584
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:13,680
All right. Dark Soccer.

1585
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:19,720
Yeah. So speaking, though, back to Dying Light, Dying Light 2 and Life is Strange

1586
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:22,200
remaster have been delayed for the Switch.

1587
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:30,600
They were supposed to be coming out very soon.

1588
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:37,240
Instead, they're looking that they're going to be coming out much later than the next

1589
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:43,000
month. The other platforms, though, should have Life is Strange remastered on February

1590
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,240
1st and Dying Light 2 on February 4th.

1591
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:55,160
And then in sad news, pinball designer Lyman Sheets died and we're all very sad.

1592
01:34:55,360 --> 01:35:03,000
He did like the last action hero, Tommy and Guns N' Roses, of which I have owned a last

1593
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,600
action hero and Guns N' Roses.

1594
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:10,000
All right. Can I tell him?

1595
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:14,280
Oh, and he also apparently worked on Medieval Madness.

1596
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:20,360
Speaking of celebrities who passed away, can I tell you maybe a slightly tasteless joke,

1597
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,760
but I thought it was really good.

1598
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,480
It's a tender subject.

1599
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,080
It's along those same lines.

1600
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:30,240
OK, so Meat Loaf passed away this week, obviously, as we know.

1601
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:34,280
And, you know, we should take a moment to remember Meat Loaf for who he was.

1602
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:40,200
He had incredible contributions to music, incredible contributions to film and things

1603
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:46,840
like Rocky Horror. And in his final years and in his final years was a raging lunatic

1604
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,720
that subscribed to conspiracy theories and said some bad things.

1605
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,720
But but two out of three ain't bad.

1606
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:58,200
That still is a tender subject.

1607
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,800
All right, moving on.

1608
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:00,480
Rob gets it.

1609
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,760
I saw that in a tweet.

1610
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:05,040
I massaged the language a little bit, made it my own.

1611
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,560
But I'm going to tell that one at the next Rocky Horror.

1612
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,240
So be ready for it.

1613
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:14,360
I still thought that there were people who were having Meat Loaf for dinner that night.

1614
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:22,760
Yeah, all right, Tiger Claw points out, we also lost Louie Anderson, who are a lot of

1615
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,720
people remember that show he had the was it Louie's Kids or something like that?

1616
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:32,760
I remember the Family Feud revival he hosted for years and years and years and him doing

1617
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:38,200
that. So, yeah, apparently I never really saw a lot of his comic stuff.

1618
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,080
But my understanding is he was a pretty bang up stand up comic.

1619
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,760
So, yeah, oh, boy.

1620
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:48,240
And then, you know, of course, we lost Betty White right at the end of last year.

1621
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:49,440
And I mean, right at the end of last year.

1622
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,080
Did you see a new video of her came out?

1623
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:51,920
Sidney Poitier.

1624
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:57,680
Oh, yeah, Sidney Poitier. But but a new Betty White video came out and that's what I was

1625
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:02,680
getting to is that something she had filmed, it looked like like an interlude, maybe for

1626
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:06,240
her hundredth thing. But it was really it was days before she ended up passing.

1627
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,320
And it was just it was nice to see her, even if it was, you know, difficult knowing what

1628
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,000
happened soon after. But, yeah, had me thinking about that.

1629
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:21,600
Let's see, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Webber Grill had their Friday recipe email come

1630
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,040
out that day, which was a meatloaf recipe.

1631
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:25,720
They issued an apology.

1632
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:29,960
You know what? That's that's the problem with auto scheduling your social media posts.

1633
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:33,360
I wouldn't have apologized for that.

1634
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:37,000
Like he's the one the food was first.

1635
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,680
He named himself after the food.

1636
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,960
His name. His name was Robert Paulson.

1637
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,120
His name was Robert.

1638
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:43,200
Actually, no, it was Marvin today.

1639
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,240
But still. All right.

1640
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,640
Let's move on in serious news.

1641
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:51,480
Let's get to world release dates and release dates in different countries, starting with

1642
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,320
the U.S. Loki.

1643
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:57,840
Yes. So this week we have the Artful Escape on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation

1644
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,040
5, Gunvolt Chronicles, Luminous Avenger, I.X.

1645
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:09,720
2. That's on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox series.

1646
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:18,360
Pokemon Legends, Arxius, better known as Unity 3D presents Pokemon Legends, Arxius.

1647
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:25,280
That is on Nintendo Switch and then better that are also known as check Shane's Twitter

1648
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,640
because he posts about literally nothing else lately.

1649
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:31,680
I saw some screenshots from it and yikes.

1650
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:35,080
And yeah, I'm intrigued.

1651
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:36,440
I'm going to buy it. I'm a play it.

1652
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:41,440
I'm intrigued. Uncharted Legacy of Thieves collection on PlayStation five.

1653
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,600
And that's it.

1654
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:47,280
I will say you do know I love me a drag queen tangent.

1655
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,800
So Dark Soccer, I bet you haven't seen this yet.

1656
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:55,120
It is a little spoilery for Arceus if you are trying to keep yourself hidden from new

1657
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:57,040
Pokemon and new forms that are in the game.

1658
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:02,160
So if you are trying to keep yourself pure from that, don't look this up.

1659
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,480
But Dark Soccer, I feel like you probably don't give a shit.

1660
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:09,080
Look at Aquarius Twitter, the winner of Drag Race Season 10 Aquaria.

1661
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,960
She did with one day's notice.

1662
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:17,280
She did an outfit based on one of the leaks from Pokemon Legends Arceus.

1663
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,160
It's pretty amazing.

1664
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:21,480
So I figured you might appreciate that.

1665
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:24,040
So I'm trying to find it.

1666
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,880
It would have been a few days ago. So sorry.

1667
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,320
I don't know how. Oh, damn.

1668
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:28,840
Yeah. Nice, huh?

1669
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1670
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:33,080
I wish I could show you the original picture again.

1671
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,800
I don't want to I don't want to broadcast it because I know some people are sensitive

1672
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,800
about spoilers, but I know Arxis Arxis.

1673
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,480
I don't know how to pronounce it, nor do I care.

1674
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,800
Arceus Arceus.

1675
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,400
I thought it was Arceus. That's how I've heard most people saying it.

1676
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,360
But OK, Arceus.

1677
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:55,840
All right, well, let's move on and talk about Japanese release dates on the switch.

1678
01:39:55,920 --> 01:40:02,400
In Japan this week, on the 27th, we have Kamigami no Asobe Luderi Deorum Unite edition.

And we have Magatsu Barai in a regular and limited edition.

1684
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,640
They love their limited editions overseas.

1685
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,400
We also have a few other games coming out.

1686
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:36,520
We have a Grand Theft Auto Trilogy Definitive Edition gets a Japanese release this week.

1687
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,880
Well, that's that's nice. Maybe they finally worked out those bugs.

1688
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:42,520
And Star Melody Yumemi Dreamer comes out in Japan this week.

1689
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:50,000
And there's one more, Shika Banagurai no Bokenmeshi comes out in Japan.

1690
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,800
It's a very busy week in Japan on the switch.

1691
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:56,960
Quickly looking to see if we have anything on the PlayStation 5 this week.

1692
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:00,800
We have some peripheral color things.

1693
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,640
Oh, the I think those are the official releases.

1694
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,720
The console covers are out this week in Japan.

1695
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:11,520
But otherwise, we have the Uncharted Legacy of Thieves collection gets its PlayStation 5 release

1696
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
and that really pretty purple wireless controller as well.

1697
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,360
So there is that.

1698
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,160
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

1699
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:23,760
On the 27th, we have Rugby 22.

1700
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:29,600
We also have Pokemon Legends Arceus on the 28th for Switch for PlayStation.

1701
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:36,400
Also on the 28th, we have the following four games, Human Fall Flat Anniversary Edition,

1702
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:43,880
Wanderer PSVR, Horror Tales and Uncharted Legacy of Thieves collection.

1703
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:46,840
All right.

1704
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:51,680
By the way, yeah, before I forget, and I should have done this right at the beginning,

1705
01:41:51,960 --> 01:42:00,120
I want to thank Blaxican for the shout out that he gave us in his channel right before we went live.

1706
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,200
So, oh, that was very nice of him.

1707
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:02,600
Thank you.

1708
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:07,880
I was watching him earlier today, but I wasn't watching before showtime.

1709
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,160
So that's very kind.

1710
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:09,760
Thank you.

1711
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,320
Shout out.

1712
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:11,720
I appreciate that.

1713
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:16,640
Yeah, it's it's been an interesting year with you and I both participating more on Twitch,

1714
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:20,200
especially you, to be quite honest, participating more on Twitch.

1715
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:26,120
It's it's really cool, like all the people we've been able to meet this year and network with.

1716
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,280
And I really hope we get to continue that in next year.

1717
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:34,840
And I hope we get to do more of that in person with events like, you know, Twitch Con and just conventions,

1718
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:40,920
you know, just fingers and toes crossed that this COVID thing can get a little more under control.

1719
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:45,920
I know it's probably going to always be endemic, but, you know, at least maybe we can look at it a little more like the flu

1720
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:49,400
and we can actually do things in person again would be really, really wonderful.

1721
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:55,600
So it'd be great to meet some of y'all very kind people from the land of Twitch.

1722
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,120
Thank you.

1723
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:57,320
All right.

1724
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,640
I will be at Dragon Con come hell or high water.

1725
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:00,960
If they have one, I'm going.

1726
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:06,920
And I don't see why they won't have one at this point, because we know a lot of the basic precautions big shows can take at this point.

1727
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:10,640
So I really do want to go to Twitch Con, but.

1728
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:16,480
I'm still iffy about conventions anyway, but I want to meet my friends.

1729
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,480
Yeah, I get it.

1730
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:24,200
And I'm and I now get to I now get to officially put myself in the immunocompromised bucket after my recent diagnosis.

1731
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:28,240
So, yeah, it's all about precautions, precautions, precautions.

1732
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,760
Yeah, but honestly, Dragon Con was great.

1733
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:38,240
Every like the thing that made it good was that everybody just fucking played by the rules.

1734
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:43,880
I didn't see people trying to hide without their mask or something like that or anything like that.

1735
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:54,920
Like, I'm sorry, I know I'm talking about a convention that happened months ago, but still, like, I just wish everything was like that, where everybody understood the rules and knew what they needed to do and just fucking followed it.

1736
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:55,960
And it was beautiful.

1737
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:59,200
Like, I just wish we could get to that for everything.

1738
01:43:59,320 --> 01:43:59,600
All right.

1739
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:07,640
Anyway, off my high horse onto Loki's high horse and a franchise that he has had a lot to say about in the last few months.

1740
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:08,160
Right, Loki?

1741
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:24,280
Yeah, so there was an interview with CEO Strauss Zelnick of Take-Two in his comments regarding Grand Theft Auto, the definitive trilogy.

1742
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:31,320
And here it's just ridiculous how much he downplays what's happened with the thing.

1743
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:36,040
So he says, and with the regards to the GTA trilogy, that was actually not a new title.

1744
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:38,280
It was a remaster of pre-existing titles.

1745
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:45,120
We did have a glitch in the beginning and that glitch was resolved and the title has done just great for the company.

1746
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,600
So we're very excited.

1747
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,840
We have an amazing pipeline going forward.

1748
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,800
One singular glitch, Loki.

1749
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:51,720
One, one glitch.

1750
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:53,920
There was a glitch in the matrix.

1751
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,520
Somebody, some oops, all berries.

1752
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,200
Sorry.

1753
01:44:58,200 --> 01:44:59,680
It was a little bit of a glitch.

1754
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:00,520
Sorry about that.

1755
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:00,880
I'm sorry.

1756
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:06,240
That's not, no, that is not a glitch.

1757
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:12,080
That, that is just a complete failure at putting together a product.

1758
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:18,560
Like, no, he's a terrible human being as far as the CEO goes.

1759
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:22,560
Like we'll get Kotick out of the way.

1760
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:26,520
Uh, as far as we know, he's not, you know, harassing women.

1761
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,840
So at least he's got that going for him right now.

1762
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:32,680
But he's still, it's still just like a very toxic company.

1763
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,360
Uh, pixel pockets and chat says one glitch as a treat.

1764
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:40,040
Uh, he three VL and chat says, did they fix the rain?

1765
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,720
Did they fix these glitches?

1766
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,080
They did fix the rain.

1767
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:43,840
They did.

1768
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:44,400
Finally.

1769
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:48,680
They basically, they waited for everybody and make the big definitive list of all the bugs.

1770
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,120
And then they went and fixed those bugs.

1771
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:52,520
How nice.

1772
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:54,360
It was just a glitch.

1773
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,320
It is only a glitch, like glitch.

1774
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:57,800
My God.

1775
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,840
That's how I'm going to review their next game.

1776
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:02,960
It's just a little glitch.

1777
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:04,880
Moving on.

1778
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:10,760
Uh, I don't know how glitchy your list for this will be, but, uh, mine's probably going to show a lot of, uh, I don't know.

1779
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:14,000
I don't, I don't know if I played a lot of PlayStation in 2021, to be honest.

1780
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Cause, uh, a lot of my game time was on my series X, but, um, I'll probably final fantasy 14 when I played on PlayStation for a bit.

1781
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:24,200
Uh, I'm talking about the PlayStation wrap up.

1782
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:29,800
Uh, it breaks down statistics of your PlayStation four and your PlayStation five play for 2021.

1783
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:32,440
I know, aren't we getting towards the end of January?

1784
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:34,200
Why aren't we still talking about 2021?

1785
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,240
Well, this site launched this week.

1786
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:45,840
It just took a little bit of time to get going, but you can go to wrapup.playstation.com and you can look at your stats for PlayStation four and five for 2021.

1787
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:52,160
Uh, when you connect your PlayStation account, you can see how many hours you spent on different PlayStation game games.

1788
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:56,680
Excuse me, the five games you played the most and what trophies you got throughout the year.

1789
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:58,440
Cause I know some of you loved a trophy hunt.

1790
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,040
That's for sure.

1791
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:08,080
Um, you can also see your playtime breakdown between PlayStation four and PlayStation five, which in my case, I never touched a PlayStation five with my account.

1792
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:12,600
I touched it when I visited Bobby Black Wolf, but it was on his account.

1793
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:16,200
Um, Oh, you do get PlayStation VR.

1794
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:21,800
So there's that if, if you were using that in the last year, uh, also, uh, some games got like.

1795
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,920
Global stats.

1796
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:32,840
So for example, death stranding director's cuts, the community has traveled 45 million kilometers and delivered 9.4 million packages.

1797
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,760
12 million hours of returnal had been played.

1798
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:41,080
34.6% of Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart players got all of the weapons.

1799
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:42,720
So there you go.

1800
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:47,720
You have to have played at least 10 hours of games on PlayStation four or five to get your stats.

1801
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:56,360
And it's not going to work if you're a PlayStation fly at five player who did not allow full data collection and consent to the additional data collection.

1802
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:57,240
Oh, I see.

1803
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,680
That's how they're going to lure you in is with the cute stats.

1804
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:00,520
There you go.

1805
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,480
So, uh, E3VL says, did they send an email for that?

1806
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,400
No, I don't think they did.

1807
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,720
I think they just blasted it with social media posts.

1808
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,840
Uh, but again, you can get one at wrapup.playstation.com.

1809
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:16,840
If you missed it, by the way, Xbox, I don't know if it's still up, but Microsoft had a really cool.

1810
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:33,280
Uh, 20th anniversary museum thing, and I'm sorry, I don't have the link, but I'm sure one of y'all in chat, we'll dig it up real quick here and I'll read it out if it's a short link, but that was a really cool thing that showed like what Xbox game have you played the most of, which I was convinced it was going to be no man's sky.

1811
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:44,640
But as it turns out, Mass Effect three was my most ever played Xbox game, which makes sense because not only was it like what, 30 hours of single player mode, how much multiplayer and Mass Effect three did we play over the years?

1812
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:45,240
A lot.

1813
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:46,040
God, so much.

1814
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:46,320
Yeah.

1815
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,640
So I was like, Oh, that's why it was so much.

1816
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:51,840
So, um, but that was another really cool thing to check out.

1817
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,120
And then, yeah, Nintendo kind of sent theirs on email, I think.

1818
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,240
So kind of neat.

1819
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:56,520
All right.

1820
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,800
Uh, moving on dark soccer.

1821
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:08,040
So, um, going back to Twitch, um, there are streamers now, uh, campaigning for a disability pride month.

1822
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:13,160
Um, of course they run awareness campaigns for different communities.

1823
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:14,120
There's been pride.

1824
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:15,280
There's been black history month.

1825
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,560
Hispanic heritage month.

1826
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:28,480
Um, so now, uh, there is a call, um, from the user voice forum, uh, for uplifting, uh, Twitch streamers with disabilities.

1827
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,600
Um, they're wanting to have, uh, different streamers be highlighted.

1828
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:47,880
Um, uh, especially some folks with invisible disabilities as well, um, to, uh, bring awareness that yes, people with various different disabilities do play games and do enjoy them and stream them.

1829
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:52,640
So, uh, The, uh, I'll find the link for everybody.

1830
01:49:52,640 --> 01:50:01,000
It's on the Twitch, uh, twitch.uservoice.com, but I will put the link in chat, uh, for the people who are here.

1831
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,120
Um, yeah, I'd sign that.

1832
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,520
I think that's a great idea.

1833
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:13,200
Um, I know there's, uh, all sorts of people that stream on this platform and it's always nice to see people different than you who also love video games because video games are for everyone.

1834
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,080
Here's my small confusion.

1835
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:18,760
Um, and I appreciate a little, um, kind education on this.

1836
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:31,000
Um, I thought that the term disability was something we were trying to get away from and say differently abled, but then I also saw with this campaign, they were saying disability is not a dirty word.

1837
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:36,960
So I'm not, what's, what's the, have we reached a consistently abled was probably created by abled people.

1838
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:37,880
Hmm.

1839
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:38,560
Interesting.

1840
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:38,920
Okay.

1841
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:49,240
And it's the same way as a bunch of these neuro-typical people deciding that we need to be called people with autism instead of autistic people without consulting us.

1842
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:50,200
Okay.

1843
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:53,000
I said someone please educate me on it.

1844
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,200
So I'm just, I'm just curious about that.

1845
01:50:55,320 --> 01:51:00,400
So, uh, dark to see in chat says definitely a cause near and dear to my heart as well as my wife's.

1846
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:03,200
So I would definitely appreciate something like that from Twitch.

1847
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:04,560
Yeah, absolutely.

1848
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:12,920
I think the more we see different gamers, uh, and all sorts of people that game, uh, the better across, we get the message that gaming is for everyone.

1849
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:25,240
And I think when you have that awareness, like, um, you know, somebody who is, let's just say somebody who is colorblind playing a game and explaining maybe like how they see the game and how things are different.

1850
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:36,320
Like it kind of just makes you more aware, like, Oh, this is why, you know, sometimes there's these different settings and games or why a UI might've been designed this way or a certain thing was picked that way.

1851
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:41,120
And that's just one of many examples, obviously that I'm, I'm thinking about.

1852
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,760
So, all right, great.

1853
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:47,440
Uh, then definitely, uh, Oh, thank you at dark soccer already linked that in chat there.

1854
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:50,680
Uh, it's a long link, so I can't read it for the podcast folks.

1855
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:55,280
Sorry, but, uh, it is on the forums at twitch.uservoice.com.

1856
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:57,080
Okay.

1857
01:51:57,120 --> 01:52:03,840
Moving on a few, uh, a few, uh, I guess, humorous stories here to close out our ninth hundredth episode Loki.

1858
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,680
Yes.

1859
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:13,040
So the, the franchise, even wanting more games for, I'm happy to tell you that they're bringing it back.

1860
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:22,640
So, uh, microids is they've signed a brand new deal to bringing three brand new Garfield games.

1861
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:23,360
That's right.

1862
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,040
You thought Garfield go was great.

1863
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:26,800
You thought Garfield cart was great.

1864
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:30,840
I have no idea what they're going to make, but it's going to be Garfield.

1865
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:38,880
Um, so yes, let's, let's wait in anticipation for more Garfield.

1866
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:40,640
How about not?

1867
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:43,360
As long as they don't release it on a Monday.

1868
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:45,840
How about just give me some lasagna?

1869
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:47,360
Sure.

1870
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:52,880
How, how, how do they not have Garfield brand lasagna available at target?

1871
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,640
Like, how is that, how is that food collaboration?

1872
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:56,640
Like that missed opportunity.

1873
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:58,160
Why is Garfield in games?

1874
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:00,120
Garfield should be in the frozen foods aisle.

1875
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:06,840
Yeah, maybe, uh, Ziba and chat says we need more Snoopy games.

1876
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:12,440
Sacred Jade said, and most likely Gar Baj to go with Garfield.

1877
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:12,840
Get it?

1878
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:13,160
Yeah.

1879
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:14,840
Womp, womp.

1880
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:18,920
Well, the last Garfield game I played was Garfield go.

1881
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,200
And yep, that's something I played.

1882
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:22,720
All right.

1883
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,720
I, I spent time on that.

1884
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:26,360
My precious valuable time.

1885
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:26,760
Sorry.

1886
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:27,320
That game.

1887
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:27,680
Yeah.

1888
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,320
Well, you know, we all make choices.

1889
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:32,000
Look, that was a choice.

1890
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,200
You were going to say something else?

1891
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:33,560
Loki.

1892
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:34,880
Yeah.

1893
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,960
I was going to say now the, the, the Garfield game they really need to make

1894
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:42,000
was the, the I'm sorry, John Garfield.

1895
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:45,960
Oh, he's like Garfield without Garfield.

1896
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:46,720
That's the game.

1897
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:47,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1898
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:48,600
Yeah.

1899
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,000
Garfield, Garfield would be fine too.

1900
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,800
No, but I'm talking about the, the kind of kafu like Garfield incantations

1901
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:58,720
where he's like this evil thing monster.

1902
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:00,720
So I want to see that.

1903
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,640
How about Garfield's Garfield smash brothers, where we just have all of

1904
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:09,880
these Garfield characters and the USA acres crew from Garfield and friends.

1905
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:11,560
All of that in one fighting game.

1906
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:16,400
I remember, remember who was on us acres, who was a previous podcast

1907
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,040
guest, Greg burger, also Grimlock.

1908
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:23,160
Oh, I will have you know, though, that Garfield was the first bit of

1909
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:26,760
DLC for nickel Nickelodeon all-star brawl.

1910
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:27,480
Oh, hooray.

1911
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:28,920
Isn't a smash brothers game.

1912
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:30,840
So yeah, thank you.

1913
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,760
I've just got tagged with that as well.

1914
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:37,520
Bobby Blackwell suggesting Andrew Garfield could be in the game.

1915
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:38,080
Yes.

1916
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,080
Andrew Garfield as Garfield in Garfield.

1917
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:42,520
No, I'm sorry.

1918
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:43,720
The role went to Chris Pratt.

1919
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:47,880
All right.

1920
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:50,120
Chris Pratt is normal.

1921
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:50,760
He is.

1922
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:54,520
All right.

1923
01:54:55,520 --> 01:55:01,160
For our last story tonight, I could think of nothing better for our 900th

1924
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:06,000
episode here on air than to talk about pornography, so let's talk about

1925
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:11,840
pornography and how it relates to final fantasy seven and, uh, yeah.

1926
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:15,640
So here's what happened in an actual lawmaker meeting for Italy.

1927
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:20,480
So these were Italian lawmakers, uh, that were meeting on zoom as a lot of,

1928
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,040
you know, is happening throughout the world.

1929
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:25,360
Uh, and they were funny enough talking about data transparency

1930
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:27,440
in political decision-making.

1931
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:32,360
And, uh, what happened is that the zoom call was introducing one of last

1932
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:35,120
year's Nobel prize winners in physics.

1933
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,640
Uh, his name was Giorgio Parisi.

1934
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:42,960
Uh, and when the zoom call, I guess, cut over, uh, there was a 30 seconds.

1935
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:47,560
Of final fantasy seven hentai porn.

1936
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:52,640
Now the official VOD for the event, funny enough, has that moment edited out,

1937
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:56,200
but you know, once on the internet, always on the internet and it's

1938
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:57,840
circulating on Twitter right now.

1939
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:58,800
Uh,

1940
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,200
I couldn't figure out why there was a bunch of pictures going around of like

1941
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:09,360
the Italian flag and Tifa, and I was like, what am I missing?

1942
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:10,720
And then, then they have the research.

1943
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:13,480
I was like, Oh, of course.

1944
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:14,440
Of course.

1945
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:20,240
Uh, and of course this, and honestly, truly at the end of the day, this

1946
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:22,240
has nothing to do with video games.

1947
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:26,160
This is somebody horny on the internet who made something horny for horny

1948
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:32,600
people, and it got played at a political event by somebody, by either somebody

1949
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,240
who was horny or a horny hacker.

1950
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:35,760
One of those things happen.

1951
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:39,920
Um, and that's, that's what it, otherwise this really has nothing to do with final

1952
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,400
fantasy seven, but our chat of course is lighting up.

1953
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:49,200
And mentioning such facts as dark Tetsuya saying, apparently Tifa was trending on

1954
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:51,600
Twitter, but there wasn't any explanation.

1955
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:57,840
Well, now we know, uh, DJ Rama S says Tifa Lockhart equals Miss Italy 2022.

1956
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,560
Uh, Mike Def points out Tifa is Italian.

1957
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,800
Is, is, is she?

1958
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,920
I don't, I don't, I don't know if that was ever explained because

1959
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:05,800
Italy doesn't exist in that universe.

1960
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:09,880
All right.

1961
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:11,480
So there you go.

1962
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:16,600
I remember the, remember I managed to find a copy of final fuck X.

1963
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:21,840
I was just about to say, this is the same show that around, it was the pre podcast

1964
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:22,080
year.

1965
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:25,000
So I would say it was probably around episode 80, 90.

1966
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:33,080
You've like under one desk, you found a video disc, a VCD of the actual porn final

1967
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:36,640
fuck X, which basically cosplay porn.

1968
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:37,640
It was horrible.

1969
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:38,320
It was horrible.

1970
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:38,880
It was pretty bad.

1971
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:41,360
I mean, you don't watch porn for the plot.

1972
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:45,520
But, uh, I, and that was the, I had never known before that, that the Japanese porn

1973
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,440
was censored whenever there was, um, penetration going on.

1974
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:51,160
So you would get the mosaic to show genitals.

1975
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:51,600
Yeah.

1976
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:55,560
But you would see before, before, uh, these women.

1977
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:57,440
Did their thing.

1978
01:57:57,600 --> 01:57:58,920
Their costumes are great.

1979
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,360
Their costumes were great.

1980
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:01,880
They were, one was dressed as Yuna.

1981
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,080
One was Lulu.

1982
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:04,360
Uh, I think that was it.

1983
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:07,440
I think it was just a Yuna, Yuna and a Lulu as if those are the only characters.

1984
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,840
Costumes were amazing.

1985
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,080
The man, no costumes.

1986
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:12,800
They're just generic dudes.

1987
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:13,200
Yeah.

1988
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:19,000
Because this was, this was pre final fantasy 14 when we realized that, you

1989
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,960
know, um, slutty armor is truly for everyone.

1990
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:26,680
Uh, so maybe, maybe if they ever make a final fuck 14, who knows?

1991
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:30,680
Uh, DJ Rama S points out typical of Japanese cosplay porn.

1992
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:33,200
You, sir, sound like you've done your research.

1993
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:38,000
Um, SSG100Matt says, I was doing a show for work and one of the panelists

1994
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:43,880
on the show had a porn pop-up tab with audio blasts during the, uh, show live

1995
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:47,200
on air, needless to say the show's archive had to be taken down.

1996
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:51,240
This is the exact same thing, but not the exact same thing, but the same

1997
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:57,640
thing as that infamous viral video of the, uh, I assure you I'm not a cat.

1998
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:03,640
Uh, it's, it's, it's that it's some horrible setting that got left on by

1999
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:07,760
accident and why the setting was tuned to final fantasy seven hentai porn.

2000
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:11,000
Well, that is the next, that's the next great Italian

2001
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,560
mystery, to be quite honest.

2002
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:18,120
There'll be writing, there'll be exposes on that for years.

2003
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,160
Anyhow, let's get to the listener round table.

2004
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:23,200
And you know what?

2005
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,680
I, I don't want to jinx it.

2006
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:28,040
Cause the minute these words leave my mouth is when problems are going to happen.

2007
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,200
However, we're in the home stretch of the show.

2008
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:35,320
So I feel okay saying we have dropped a total of 22 frames

2009
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:36,040
through the whole show.

2010
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:36,520
That's it.

2011
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:39,000
22 as less than a second has drawn.

2012
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:39,880
They weren't good frames.

2013
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:40,480
They weren't good.

2014
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:43,640
Well, I think they were during the classic game of the week, if I remember right.

2015
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:45,000
So they weren't even pictures of us.

2016
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:45,680
So it's fine.

2017
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,440
It was somebody else's game.

2018
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,200
So, uh, it's, uh, that's it.

2019
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,760
We've, we've actually been able to maintain an internet connection.

2020
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:53,680
Knock on wood, of course.

2021
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:54,000
Yes.

2022
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,280
Now that I've said that goodbye.

2023
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:55,720
Good night.

2024
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,960
But maybe we can actually get some calls on discord tonight.

2025
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:00,640
We'll try it.

2026
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:02,840
Let's see what's the worst that can happen.

2027
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:08,400
So if you want to call on discord, uh, twitch.tv or excuse me, well, twitch.tv

2028
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,040
slash vog network is where we're live.

2029
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:15,640
But if you want to join our discord, go to vog network.com slash discord, and, uh,

2030
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:20,560
we will, uh, be awaiting you in the green room and, uh, until we do that,

2031
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:22,000
let's check in on the mailbag.

2032
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,840
I don't remember if we have anything, but, um, I'll check in cause stuff

2033
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:27,440
might've accumulated while we've been having internet issues.

2034
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:31,760
So participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place you can send us an email.

2035
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:33,040
Do we have an emails?

2036
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,560
We have none.

2037
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:39,400
However, I do want to, um, let you know something that I've just seen come

2038
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:40,760
to light, thanks to our friend.

2039
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:42,200
Okay.

2040
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:48,720
Um, uh, Sacramento's main arcade provider has lost a lot of arcade machines

2041
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:51,160
due to a fire at the Sacramento drive-in.

2042
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:53,800
Oh, I heard about the fire over there.

2043
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:54,880
Yeah.

2044
02:00:54,920 --> 02:01:00,440
Um, there is a go fund me set up, um, to raise $20,000 to help replace

2045
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:02,160
the machines and do repairs.

2046
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:04,080
Didn't they have a DDR machine over there?

2047
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:04,880
I'm pretty sure they did.

2048
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:05,400
I thought so.

2049
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,120
I think one of my friends went to see Rocky horror there and played DDR

2050
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:11,960
and frankenfurter, um, cosplay, which is great.

2051
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:17,480
Well, I'll put the go fund me up, um, in there, but, um, but if anyone,

2052
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:22,840
um, Uh, is interested in contributing, I have reposted and on my own

2053
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:26,000
Twitter at dark Sakura, thank you for that.

2054
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:29,400
I'm although I'm sad to hear that news, but, um, I feel bad for that.

2055
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:32,800
Every year they threatened to shut down and now this year it catches fire.

2056
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:33,240
It's sad.

2057
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:35,920
Although I guess the project it's, it's all the, uh, like you said, like

2058
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:40,080
the arcade games and the, um, uh, concessions area, uh, not the

2059
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:41,920
projection, I guess is okay.

2060
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:43,640
And that's what the expensive stuff really is.

2061
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:47,240
So, but theaters make a lot of their money on concessions.

2062
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,680
I don't know how that works out when it's a drive-in and probably

2063
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:52,800
people are bringing all of their own stuff to eat and drink on

2064
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:54,360
anyway, but still it's still.

2065
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:55,600
All right.

2066
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:59,600
Um, let's check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

2067
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:03,040
No, I don't have any.

2068
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:04,680
No, nothing.

2069
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,120
All right.

2070
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:08,280
Well, um, I don't see anybody in the green room.

2071
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:10,640
I'll give it one more moment to see if anyone wants to call in.

2072
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:14,280
Otherwise, let me check in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.

2073
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:17,680
You know, when we don't get any emails, we usually talk about drag race.

2074
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:18,720
I'm just going to ask real quick.

2075
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:20,440
Cause dark soccer season 14 started.

2076
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:21,440
I don't know if you've been watching.

2077
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:23,040
I've seen bits and pieces.

2078
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:24,280
What's Oh, you have.

2079
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:25,520
I cannot.

2080
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:26,160
Oh, you can't.

2081
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:26,720
Oh, damn.

2082
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:32,080
Cause I was going to ask if you have a fave, but, um, there was the one

2083
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:34,240
who came out, I think all in polka dots.

2084
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:43,640
I watched, I watched the, the walk-ins on someone's channel, but I don't remember.

2085
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:44,640
Was that in Nigeria?

2086
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:46,080
Might've been Nigeria that did that.

2087
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:49,960
That might be, um, there's a lot of strong people this season.

2088
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:53,000
My favorites are dia Betty for obvious reasons.

2089
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:57,880
Um, and, uh, I also, uh, she's not a big pill.

2090
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,440
She's a willow pill.

2091
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:01,960
I just watched some of Willow pills outfits.

2092
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:02,960
Just very glamorous.

2093
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:03,320
Yeah.

2094
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:04,360
I think Willow pills.

2095
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:05,440
Fantastic.

2096
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:09,400
I honestly, so, uh, the, I need a way to watch, so I'm going to try to figure

2097
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:13,720
something out if you can't see, if you can't watch anything else from drag race

2098
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:19,440
this season, watch, cause they, they, they Jack the thing from all stars where they

2099
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:24,560
do, uh, um, talent show in the first episode, watch Willow pills talent show.

2100
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,960
It's amazing.

2101
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:26,800
Okay.

2102
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:31,040
By the way, apparently Brittany covered, you ought to know and nailed it.

2103
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Oh, like on her Instagram.

2104
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:37,600
Um, I think on like a live stage.

2105
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:39,000
Oh, interesting.

2106
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:42,880
But Brittany hasn't, I mean, it has to be an old clip cause Brittany hasn't done any

2107
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:47,040
performing since the whole, it was reposted by Marina from Marina and the diamonds.

2108
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:48,640
It's it's gotta be old though.

2109
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:51,080
Cause Brittany hasn't performed since the whole, um, executive

2110
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:52,360
ship and that whole thing.

2111
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:53,560
She didn't want to perform.

2112
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:56,640
She was doing, I don't know how old it is, but I never knew this clip

2113
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:57,960
existed and it's pretty awesome.

2114
02:03:58,240 --> 02:03:58,440
Yeah.

2115
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:01,760
I mean, old stuff resurfaces sometimes it still doesn't make it any less great.

2116
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,560
Um, Kelly Clarkson recently did a hands clean by Alanis.

2117
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:05,840
It was great.

2118
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:07,000
Kelly Clarkson.

2119
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:08,960
I like, she's one of those people.

2120
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:11,080
It's like, I always forget how fucking good she is.

2121
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:13,040
And then like one of her covers will just float it.

2122
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:16,240
Cause she did, she has a cover literally every day because of her talk show.

2123
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:21,080
And one of her covers comes across my Twitter feed and I'm like, God, that woman

2124
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:26,120
is a gift, you know, not that I, I don't want to speak anything negative about

2125
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:31,960
Dolly Parton, put her in a bubble, protect her, save her, but I do feel like Kelly

2126
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:36,040
Clarkson is sort of being groomed for that role when Dolly Parton inevitably

2127
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:37,680
leaves that leaves this earth.

2128
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,160
So.

2129
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:39,240
There is that.

2130
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:40,400
All right.

2131
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,520
But not for like 25 years.

2132
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,000
Okay.

2133
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:46,200
If, uh, we could, Dolly needs 25 more years.

2134
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:46,880
Yeah.

2135
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:48,200
You need to talk to share.

2136
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:49,080
Okay.

2137
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:52,800
And do whatever she taught to Keith Richards.

2138
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:56,160
Talk to Keith Richards.

2139
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:58,600
That's what Betty should have done was taught to Keith Richards.

2140
02:04:58,600 --> 02:04:59,320
I'm just saying.

2141
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:00,240
All right.

2142
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:03,160
Uh, let's, we actually have a call in the green room.

2143
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:04,560
I want to get to this cause I have a feeling.

2144
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,320
I know what this person is calling in to talk about and I

2145
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:07,200
definitely want to hear it.

2146
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:11,280
So let's get to it and welcome our caller onto the show.

2147
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:12,960
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

2148
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:13,440
Who's this?

2149
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:15,240
Hey everyone.

2150
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:17,080
It's a show under Matt.

2151
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:17,680
Hey, Matt.

2152
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:18,560
It's good to hear from you.

2153
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,160
If you want to, oh, it's just about to say you can turn on your cam if you want,

2154
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:24,960
but some, some people call in and are like, you don't want me to turn my cam on.

2155
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:25,280
Trust me.

2156
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:25,560
Okay.

2157
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:25,880
Don't.

2158
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:26,320
All right.

2159
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:27,800
Hey, good to see you, Matt.

2160
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:31,320
Well, now, now I got to try to concentrate, not to look at the TV.

2161
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:32,360
I know.

2162
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:33,040
I know.

2163
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,080
Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

2164
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:37,960
So, um, this is a little delayed, but I wanted to call in and talk

2165
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:39,640
a little bit about a mag fest.

2166
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:40,880
Well, the delay is our fault.

2167
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:41,800
Not yours, please.

2168
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,120
I want to hear about mag fest.

2169
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:43,600
How was it?

2170
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:49,240
Um, so, well, first off, I wanted to say that I am, uh, I came back, uh,

2171
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:52,840
fine and safe, I didn't get sick or anything like that first.

2172
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:56,280
First off, who is that cute little fuzz ball behind you?

2173
02:05:57,240 --> 02:05:59,160
Oh, he's awake.

2174
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:01,160
Um, his name is Finn.

2175
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:03,120
It's, uh, it's our pop.

2176
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:03,840
Okay.

2177
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:07,240
Uh, um, what are you French bulldog?

2178
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:10,120
Uh, Boston terrier, Boston terrier.

2179
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:12,720
Sorry to the facial shape.

2180
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:16,800
Sorry to the podcast listeners who can't see the dog, but, um, also

2181
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:19,080
not sorry, because I'm always going to ask about the cute animals.

2182
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:19,440
Sorry.

2183
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:24,640
But also, um, he is, uh, he is, he is on the subscriber chat.

2184
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:31,120
I did post a picture a while back, but regardless, um, uh, so yeah, mag fest.

2185
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:38,640
Um, uh, so mag fest was obviously very different this year, um, because

2186
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:45,720
of all the COVID stuff and, um, they, and it did have a very good time.

2187
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:47,520
They did, they did make a lot of changes.

2188
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:56,320
Um, it did require a vaccination and, uh, everybody to be masked at all times.

2189
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:02,080
And that ended up being very good because I think, uh, I think other

2190
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:05,920
conventions that have had similar requirements, they've all kind of

2191
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:11,960
worked out and every, and it seems like everybody did, uh, did follow the rules.

2192
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,240
And that was the case of mag fest as well.

2193
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:14,720
Yeah.

2194
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:16,760
And I think it's important to point out, you know, I've talked about

2195
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:20,800
dragon con and how great that felt, even if it was a little weird, but

2196
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:24,480
dragon con was also kind of like not, I mean, I guess it was kind of during

2197
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:28,040
the Delta variant and all that, but you guys had to deal with the mag fest,

2198
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:31,960
had to deal with the Omicron variant and how that has been really growing.

2199
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:36,080
And so like, you know, to be fair, that wasn't a concern at dragon con,

2200
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:39,200
whereas, you know, you had this new, highly contagious variant.

2201
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:42,080
And I think that made a lot of people question like, Oh shit, is

2202
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:43,440
mag fest even going to happen?

2203
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:47,320
Although now, you know, no, no company's going to get out of the

2204
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:48,800
legal necessities to put that on.

2205
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:52,480
So I was kind of curious, like what precautions they were going to taste.

2206
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,680
They actually required full vaccination and mass.

2207
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:55,160
That's good.

2208
02:07:56,120 --> 02:07:56,440
Yeah.

2209
02:07:56,520 --> 02:08:01,280
And, um, and even, and even me, like I like with everything that was going

2210
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:07,480
on, I kind of like, I didn't decide on going finally until like the day before.

2211
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:11,000
Cause it was just like, things were just getting worse.

2212
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:16,960
Maryland, the state of Maryland where mag fest is, they had a, did a state of

2213
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,120
emergency because cases were just so high in the DC area.

2214
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:27,480
So, um, I just kind of decided that, you know, I'm going to do all the right things.

2215
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:28,320
I'm going to follow the rules.

2216
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:29,360
I'm going to wear a mask.

2217
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:33,880
I even even wore a face shield and that all seemed to work out.

2218
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:40,440
Um, but, um, I just decided that, you know, like I needed to kind of just get

2219
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:48,120
out of the house, do something and this felt, you know, I felt like the

2220
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:52,080
precautions and everything were pretty safe and going there, everything.

2221
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:55,880
Um, there was a lot less capacity.

2222
02:08:56,280 --> 02:09:00,920
Um, typically make best gets about 22,000 attendees.

2223
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:07,720
Um, this year they had just under 11, uh, about half that a little less than half of that.

2224
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:15,640
And, um, and, but see, I love dragon con at half capacity, even if it's probably not

2225
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:20,600
sustainable, that I loved it at half capacity and, and, you know, and, and

2226
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:24,440
magfest was about the same, cause it just, it felt a lot more kind of open.

2227
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:28,640
And, um, yeah, there were fewer, you know, machines, there were fewer

2228
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:33,720
because in the arcade area, you know, you could just play any, the kind of the nice

2229
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:40,040
thing about magfest is that it kind of runs, um, 24 hours through the, through

2230
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:41,600
the whole, through the whole weekend.

2231
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:44,600
Um, they had to change that because of staff issues.

2232
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,880
It didn't have people that didn't have enough volunteers to watch the arcade

2233
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:51,200
room and expo hall for the whole time.

2234
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:54,080
So they had to close from 4 AM to 8 AM.

2235
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:57,840
Um, but you know, there were fewer machines.

2236
02:09:57,880 --> 02:10:01,320
There were, there were fewer guests, a lot of guests dropped out at the last minute.

2237
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:06,760
Um, and, but they did do a lot of like nice virtual things.

2238
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:15,440
They, um, they did some VR chat stuff where people could watch parts of the

2239
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:17,240
parts of the show through VR chat.

2240
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:21,600
And, uh, different concerts and everything like that.

2241
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:26,880
So, and there were like some stations where you can, uh, see people in VR chat.

2242
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:31,800
Um, and interact and interact with those people.

2243
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:33,320
Um, that's neat.

2244
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:38,440
And they had, and apparently there's a whole, there was a whole, like a

2245
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:41,080
conventions that are metaverse.

2246
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:45,640
People can go around, they can, and there's been like a little, like a

2247
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:49,480
in-joke at magfest with, uh, Danny DeVito shrine.

2248
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:50,200
Oh yeah.

2249
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:51,000
Yeah.

2250
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:51,600
I saw that.

2251
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:52,400
I saw that.

2252
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,400
And the Betty white shrine.

2253
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:56,680
Yeah, they have a, they, they, and the Betty white shrine was,

2254
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:58,240
that was the new thing this year.

2255
02:10:58,320 --> 02:10:58,480
Yeah.

2256
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:03,480
So, um, but everybody, for the most part, everybody that I saw and every

2257
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,840
that I kind of interacted with, everybody followed the rules.

2258
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:10,240
Everybody wore a mask, everybody kind of social distance.

2259
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:14,640
I kind of did, I kind of had to change my, the way that I kind of do.

2260
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:18,920
Magfest, uh, typically I have, we have a bunch of friends come.

2261
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:22,800
Um, very few of my friends came for obvious reasons.

2262
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:25,400
Um, and typically we'd go to the concerts.

2263
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:27,120
I didn't really attend to the concerts.

2264
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:32,280
And, um, I didn't really attend some, some of their bigger panels.

2265
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:36,240
It's just kind of like I poke, I would poke my head and see how busy and just

2266
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:40,320
kind of, kind of get the feeling before I kind of like committed to like going

2267
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:44,280
into some things, um, just because just like,

2268
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:49,080
just wanted to kind of just be as safe as possible. But even like,

2269
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:52,640
just like with that, I kind of still had a good time.

2270
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:55,160
And, um,

2271
02:11:55,200 --> 02:12:00,200
I think that there's definitely a space for conventions even in this era of

2272
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:07,200
COVID and everything that I think that if shows do the right things and every,

2273
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:11,200
and all the attendees do all the right things that I think that it can still,

2274
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:14,320
that, uh, conventions can still work in this era.

2275
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:18,200
Yeah. Um, you know, I want to, it just goes to show, you know, cause I,

2276
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:22,520
and I haven't heard of Magfest having been a super spreader event.

2277
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:26,080
Um, and I know with Dragon Con, a lot of people were screaming beforehand,

2278
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:29,920
it's going to be a super spreader event and it does go to show that while yes,

2279
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:34,240
there is an increased risk with that. You are putting yourself at risk. Um,

2280
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:37,840
if you follow the rules, take precautions, you know,

2281
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:38,480
and in addition to,

2282
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:42,360
I know you isolated for a few days after the fact as did I after Dragon Con,

2283
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:43,880
you know, and then get tested and all that stuff.

2284
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:48,240
It's like you can kind of make these things work. Um, and you know,

2285
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:51,680
Omicron won't be around forever and hopefully not too much longer.

2286
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:55,120
And maybe when we get more endemic, maybe we'll still have, I don't know,

2287
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:57,200
masks and vaccines at conventions,

2288
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:00,680
but maybe we'll be able to have a lot of people back and all that. Um,

2289
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:03,600
I still think it would be really good to have a lot of people back and all that.

2290
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:04,920
I still think it would be really cool.

2291
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,360
Some of these things kind of stick around.

2292
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:10,280
Like you were talking about the VR chat and the metaverse and allowing people

2293
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:13,600
who maybe like physically can't get to magfest,

2294
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:18,000
even if COVID wasn't a thing, uh, allow them to still participate.

2295
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:19,400
I think that's kind of cool.

2296
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:23,520
So I hope that they do kind of keep some of those things that they've had to

2297
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:26,960
think about because of COVID involved, um, in the future,

2298
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:31,720
just like Dragon Con and Dragon Con TV and expanding that and allowing more home

2299
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:34,640
access in that regard and their discord server and all that stuff. You know,

2300
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:37,960
a lot of conventions are finding sort of their niches and their ways to sort of

2301
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:41,880
expand in the era of COVID. And I think that's a really, really good thing. So.

2302
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:46,120
Yeah. And, uh, and just one more thing that I forgot to mention that magfest did,

2303
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:48,480
that was kind of, that I thought it was nice. Some people aren't,

2304
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:52,800
aren't really too crazy about it. Um, that, um, magfest,

2305
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:56,680
they kind of did like their own little contract tracing, um,

2306
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:59,920
thing, uh, afterwards, um,

2307
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:03,440
everybody who got tested and came back positive,

2308
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:07,560
they were encouraged to fill out a Google spreadsheet of

2309
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:11,560
where they went, when did they get tested and,

2310
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:13,640
and magfest published all the,

2311
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:18,280
all the reports and everything of where these people went. Um,

2312
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:21,400
they didn't say, you know, like they, everything was anonymous, but, um,

2313
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:25,000
they said like, okay, if you were at this panel, uh,

2314
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:29,960
one person was tested positive there. So if, so if you were at this panel,

2315
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:34,000
maybe you should get yourself tested and they published the whole list.

2316
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:38,040
Something unofficial like that kind of happened with dragon con and we actually

2317
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:42,680
found out one of the panelists on one of the tracks I was on was positive for

2318
02:14:42,680 --> 02:14:46,240
COVID and went to dragon con annoyingly with COVID. Um,

2319
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:49,920
but the good news was nobody got nobody like everybody on the track,

2320
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:51,880
at least all the panelists that talk on this discord,

2321
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:55,920
all of them got lab tested, including myself. None of us were positive.

2322
02:14:55,960 --> 02:15:00,760
So that was like, you know, obviously it sucks. Someone had COVID, but, um,

2323
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:05,120
that was really refreshing. So, yeah. And yeah, no.

2324
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:06,880
And I think the numbers,

2325
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:11,440
so they published the numbers of like how many people like self-reported and

2326
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:16,360
they said about 187 people tested positive afterwards out of, you know,

2327
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:21,480
well, but out of 11,000, that's actually, you know, and you don't know if

2328
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:25,040
reported. So then some of them, so the members might be more, but.

2329
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:28,960
But also they maybe didn't get it at magfest because I know when I went to

2330
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:32,880
dragon, if I got COVID in Atlanta, it was on public transit.

2331
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:35,520
It was not a dragon con. Like I, like it was,

2332
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:39,720
there's other elements to getting to the con that I think have to be considered

2333
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:40,560
as well.

2334
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:44,760
Of course. Yeah. So, um, you know,

2335
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:46,320
like I did all the right things.

2336
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:50,600
I took a week off and kind of just isolated. I mean, I work from home anyways,

2337
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:54,680
but it's, um, I did all the right things. I didn't go out and kill my family.

2338
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:58,520
Like a lot of people on the internet claim that anyone who attended magfest was

2339
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:01,560
going to do now. It just, um,

2340
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:08,040
I mean, I think, I think that you,

2341
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:11,880
you just have to assume that everybody who wants to do something public

2342
02:16:13,240 --> 02:16:16,760
has best intent and that they're going to do the right thing. I think that's,

2343
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:17,600
you just have to,

2344
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:22,720
you just have to just assume that anyone will kind of do that because not

2345
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:26,240
everybody is like a, you know, spring break party boat,

2346
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:29,000
everybody not vaccinated and all that stuff.

2347
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:33,480
It's a lot of people follow the rules and do all the right things. So.

2348
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,640
Was it like, you know,

2349
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:40,040
going back to kind of the point of magfest and you know you willing to put

2350
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:44,840
yourself at the risk and all that stuff. What was it nice to just have a taste?

2351
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:48,920
What was it about magfest that made you go, you know what,

2352
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:50,320
I'm really glad I did this.

2353
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:55,800
Um, I think being, you know, being, being stuck at home for so long,

2354
02:16:55,800 --> 02:17:00,400
just just like I kind of needed to get out, you know, and, um,

2355
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:02,120
just kind of just like,

2356
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:06,520
it was just a little taste of just kind of like this is what things were like

2357
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:07,040
before.

2358
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:12,040
And like I was able to take a semi real vacation in a ways for all this.

2359
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:17,000
So it, it's just a, for just mentally, it's just like, it's just,

2360
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,440
it's nice to kind of just do something even though like there's restrictions

2361
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:26,200
and all that stuff. I think it's just nice to just kind of just have some joy,

2362
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:27,480
do, do something fun.

2363
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:29,960
All right. Well,

2364
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:32,560
thank you for calling in tonight and talking about your magfest experience.

2365
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:36,800
I appreciate it. And, uh, let's all, and of course, and of course,

2366
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:41,520
happy 900th episodes. Thank you. Thank you.

2367
02:17:42,040 --> 02:17:42,880
I appreciate that.

2368
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:46,400
Couldn't have done it without the support of you and so many other people that

2369
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:48,320
participate with our show for a long time.

2370
02:17:48,560 --> 02:17:51,040
I know you haven't been here since episode one, but let's be honest.

2371
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:52,480
It kind of feels like it. I was,

2372
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:55,320
I think I came in in the red of double digits there, but that's,

2373
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:58,960
that is pretty fucking impressive, honestly. And you know what? I don't care.

2374
02:17:59,400 --> 02:18:03,160
I don't care if episode three was your first show or if episode 900 is your

2375
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:07,760
first show. Welcome. Thank you. I hope you, I hope you'd enjoy,

2376
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:10,800
hope you enjoy being a part of this because we really enjoy having everybody

2377
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:13,600
here. We certainly have. And, uh, of course,

2378
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:16,800
congratulations in the house for you and Alan.

2379
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:22,160
And I hope it's a really an experience and, uh,

2380
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:23,880
don't drive yourself nuts with the move.

2381
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:29,480
We hired movers already. So that part is now it's just packet. No,

2382
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:31,200
cause when we saved the money, I knew,

2383
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:36,160
I said we are saving like an extra dollars to

2384
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:40,360
earmark movers. Cause we're not like we're at that age where pizza and beer

2385
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:45,080
doesn't work anymore to get movers. It worked on me, which is all.

2386
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:48,640
That's very sweet. Thank you. Um, maybe you can help us sort through some,

2387
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:49,120
you know what?

2388
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:52,800
I need somebody to help set up my office with all these cute little mini arcade

2389
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:56,200
cabs and things like that. So maybe I'll, I'll ask you to help me with that.

2390
02:18:56,360 --> 02:18:58,800
But it is really cute. I will say this, um, because you know,

2391
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:02,200
I do this stuff with Rocky horror here locally and the horror film festival and

2392
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:03,880
I have, you know, different friend groups through that.

2393
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:07,600
And there are a lot of younger folks like in their twenties and so forth.

2394
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:11,080
And it is very cute because so many of them are offering to help.

2395
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:13,640
Like if you need anything with moving, let me know. And I'm like, Oh God,

2396
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:17,920
I love you so much. But trust me, when you get, when you get to 40,

2397
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:20,680
your forties, you're like, I'm just paying for movers to do it.

2398
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:22,840
And it'll be done in three hours.

2399
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:29,240
When we moved into this house. Um, cause keep in mind, I,

2400
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:33,080
I think we were just in our very late thirties when we did it,

2401
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:37,560
but we did everything ourselves. But you know,

2402
02:19:37,560 --> 02:19:39,200
with the pinball crowd,

2403
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:44,000
we know so many people who have like dollies

2404
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:47,800
and lifting jacks and all kinds of stuff.

2405
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:48,680
That's true.

2406
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:53,920
The, for us, it was like, we'll just, we'll just have our friends. I mean,

2407
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:56,280
and I moved a lot of stuff at my Fiat,

2408
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:59,120
a lot of stuff fit in that Fiat.

2409
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:04,880
Pod culture is asking, will Mr. Smoosh get his own room? No,

2410
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:07,160
we're taking his room away, the guest room.

2411
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:12,040
So that Alan and I can have separate offices so that hopefully on our gigabit

2412
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:15,280
fiber, we can both stream at the same time.

2413
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:18,880
That is what we're hoping for the new setup.

2414
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:23,920
Mr. Smoosh will get to share his new room and his potty box, uh,

2415
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:28,560
with the washer and dryer in a facility. Cause now in newer houses,

2416
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:29,760
you don't really put it in the garage.

2417
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:32,720
They actually have like a laundry room in the house. So that's what we have. So,

2418
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:36,880
um, that's where Mr. Smoosh's, uh, stuff can go as far as I'm concerned.

2419
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,400
But I'm excited for him to lose a little weight, uh,

2420
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:41,640
hoofing it up and down the stairs cause the new house has stairs.

2421
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:43,320
So he has to hoof it up and down the stairs.

2422
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:48,040
It didn't help Shermy much. Remember? Oh, oh really? Oh yeah. Oh well.

2423
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:51,000
But, but, um, uh,

2424
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:54,440
DJ Rama asked if Mr. Smoosh got the arcade machine.

2425
02:20:55,920 --> 02:21:00,960
I, I said that to Dan and he reminded me of when Shermy

2426
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:05,640
lived inside of a pole position. Um, remember that? Yes, I do.

2427
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:09,160
I do. And the answer to Rama's question, uh, no, um,

2428
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:12,560
because our policy right now is less stuff, not more.

2429
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:16,360
So we're not taking on any new stuff until after the move is done.

2430
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:21,520
But if those machines are, so what he sent me for those, it was, um,

2431
02:21:21,560 --> 02:21:23,760
it's a cat scratcher, like a wooden scratch,

2432
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:26,520
but it looks like an arcade machine and it's really fucking cute.

2433
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,280
It's like a kitty arcade machine. And so, um,

2434
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:32,720
if the move and they're still available after the move,

2435
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:33,880
I will happily get them one.

2436
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:37,400
Here's something else I need everybody to consider. And, um,

2437
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:41,800
this will not be a surprise anyway. So right now we only have Mr. Smoosh,

2438
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:46,240
one cat because our landlord only allows one pet. Guess what else happened?

2439
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:48,320
Change. Guess what else changes in February?

2440
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:52,880
We don't have a landlord anymore. So, so y'all,

2441
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:55,120
y'all can read between the lines of what I'm getting at.

2442
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:58,360
So don't think about just Mr. Smoosh in this picture.

2443
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:02,000
Really careful and see if Mr. Smoosh is okay with other cats.

2444
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:06,160
Yeah. We need to find something where it's acceptable for us to do a test run.

2445
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:10,080
And Alan and I have to be able to accept the fact that it might not work.

2446
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:12,720
And that's the whole reason we ended up independent fosters.

2447
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:14,640
And that's the whole reason we ended up with Mr.

2448
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:19,360
Smoosh in the first place is that the, the person that found Mr. Smoosh, uh,

2449
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:20,640
the friend of a friend that,

2450
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:23,560
that realized Smoosh had been abandoned and that something had happened to his

2451
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:26,360
eye and all that stuff, uh, tried to take him in,

2452
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:28,720
but the other cat was not having them.

2453
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:33,240
So she knew she had to find a different, um, uh,

2454
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:37,560
family and we were ready and available. Anyway, uh,

2455
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:38,800
Quest Buster says-

2456
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:43,360
Well there's always going to be an introductory period. A lot of, uh,

2457
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:47,760
really good things to do to, to bring a cat in is that when you bring in a new

2458
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:51,000
cat, you do need to give them about a week of quarantine.

2459
02:22:51,640 --> 02:22:55,040
More like if they're young cats. Um,

2460
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:59,880
and then a thing that you can do is start feeding them separately and then

2461
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:03,200
slowly move their bowls together and feed them at the same time.

2462
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:04,200
Yeah.

2463
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:08,600
And then that helps with, I've, I fostered a little bit in my time.

2464
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:10,000
I've introduced a kitten.

2465
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:14,240
You should have seen when I brought my cat Ranma home when old man was alive,

2466
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:16,920
when I lived in Alabama, that was an adventure.

2467
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:18,680
Um,

2468
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:22,040
Dr. Tzuyu says my wife's cat is always rubbing up against my Ms.

2469
02:23:22,040 --> 02:23:24,320
Pac-Man one up. I think she thinks it's hers now.

2470
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:27,040
There's something about those machines that cats love.

2471
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:30,040
When I turn on the burger time machine, if smooshes around,

2472
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:33,680
his eyes light the fuck up and like,

2473
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,480
he wants to get right up in that screen.

2474
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:40,400
It's something about the lights and the noise. He's so into it. Yeah.

2475
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:41,240
It's wild.

2476
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:42,320
Midna's completely indifferent.

2477
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:43,480
Yeah.

2478
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:45,040
All right. Sorry. Sorry, Matt.

2479
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:48,040
I know you're calling with your dog and here we are having cat talk.

2480
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:50,400
All right.

2481
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:51,240
Hi cutie.

2482
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:53,160
He's actually, he's actually terrified of cats.

2483
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:54,080
Oh, that's cute.

2484
02:23:54,560 --> 02:23:55,400
Oh, poppers.

2485
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:56,120
I love that.

2486
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:57,360
He's terrified of cats.

2487
02:23:57,360 --> 02:24:02,040
He thinks they're dogs, but that they, he thinks that they're dogs, but you know,

2488
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:05,680
they just being off put, off putting and, uh, don't want to play with them.

2489
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:08,280
Oh, Midna loves dogs.

2490
02:24:08,280 --> 02:24:09,320
And he, she liked one too.

2491
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:11,120
And one too was a big,

2492
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:13,920
scary pit bull who was really a little puppy in her heart.

2493
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:16,720
All right, Matt, I'm going to let you go,

2494
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:18,800
but thank you so much for calling into the show tonight and talking about

2495
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:21,800
MagFest. It's really nice to hear that, uh, the conventions are,

2496
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:23,200
are making it work. Uh,

2497
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:25,240
and maybe we can have a taste of that again,

2498
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:27,960
especially as we look to things like TwitchCon and you know,

2499
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:29,920
all the stuff we want to go to in 2022.

2500
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:32,440
So, all right.

2501
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:33,960
Yeah, you too.

2502
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:34,640
Take care of my friend.

2503
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:35,360
Bye bye.

2504
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:37,240
All right.

2505
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:40,560
Always good to hear from our folks that are out there listening.

2506
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:43,680
I think that was the only call I saw in the green room.

2507
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:44,720
So I think with that,

2508
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:48,120
we will probably go to wrapping up our show tonight.

2509
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:51,200
Thanks again as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

2510
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:52,040
And as I said,

2511
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:56,240
whether it's your first time listening or your 899th time listening,

2512
02:24:56,520 --> 02:24:59,440
thank you so much for being a part of the show tonight. Uh,

2513
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:04,360
we'll be back in seven days for episode number 901 and maybe the

2514
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:07,560
internet issues are a thing of the past. Fingers crossed, toes crossed.

2515
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:09,240
There's one other thing I forgot to mention.

2516
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:10,160
All right.

2517
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:14,360
This today marks, um,

2518
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:18,400
my anniversary of living in California now officially more than half of my life.

2519
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:20,520
Oh, well, congrats.

2520
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:21,880
Thank you.

2521
02:25:21,880 --> 02:25:24,720
I think we can officially say you're a California girl.

2522
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,640
The day, uh, Dan and I met in person.

2523
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:29,600
Oh, wowee.

2524
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:30,360
Oh, that's amazing.

2525
02:25:30,360 --> 02:25:31,680
So you've known Dan half your life.

2526
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:34,520
More than, well, more.

2527
02:25:34,520 --> 02:25:36,720
Well, yeah, more than half in person, more than half.

2528
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:38,080
Wow. Wow.

2529
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:40,080
Congrats. Mazel tov.

2530
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:40,760
All right.

2531
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:41,320
Thank you.

2532
02:25:41,320 --> 02:25:44,320
Um, so, OK, uh, where was I?

2533
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:46,360
Yes, thank you for listening.

2534
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:48,440
And if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

2535
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:50,200
tell a friend or two about the show.

2536
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:53,000
Even if you hated the show and yet somehow still made it to the end.

2537
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:56,040
Tell somebody you think might actually like this stuff.

2538
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:00,800
Make a YouTube about this show and everything that's wrong with it.

2539
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:03,120
And Logie will watch it.

2540
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:05,200
No, seriously, tell a friend or two about the show.

2541
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:07,920
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2542
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:11,640
But we want more voices here to get those thoughts and opinions out on the air.

2543
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:17,040
If you want to join our discord, we'd love to have you vognetwork.com

2544
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:22,240
slash discord, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify,

2545
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:24,680
wherever it is you actually Spotify does have reviews now.

2546
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:27,160
So those actually do work on there.

2547
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:29,920
So please, if you haven't yet rated us there, please consider it.

2548
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:32,320
And all of that goes an awful long way.

2549
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:34,480
And again, just thank you for being a part of it.

2550
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:37,400
We really couldn't have got to episode 900 without your help.

2551
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:41,000
And here's here's hoping for a thousand.

2552
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:45,160
That's it. I can't think of anything else to say.

2553
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:47,600
So let's get to the final thoughts.

2554
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:51,280
Dark Sakura, I know you're probably going to go off and start your killing

2555
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:53,720
and dead by daylight, so I'll let you go first with your final thought.

2556
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:56,840
Um, I'm going to try to make it a full stream.

2557
02:26:56,840 --> 02:27:00,440
I'm still feeling a little bit under the weather, but we'll try.

2558
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:03,040
I'm on my second round of antibiotics. Can you believe it?

2559
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:04,960
Oh, boy. Feel better.

2560
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:06,840
Thank you. Later, caters.

2561
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:09,160
At least at least it wasn't COVID.

2562
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:11,000
At least it was a COVID.

2563
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,520
I know it's like the saying of the year.

2564
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:14,560
All right. Take care of Dark Sakura.

2565
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:16,360
All right. Bye, everybody.

2566
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:19,240
Loki, I'll go to you for your final thought.

2567
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:21,720
My final thought is that I'm

2568
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:25,880
going to try to put out another episode here pretty soon of my YouTube series.

2569
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:28,360
I'm still working on a very large builder right now.

2570
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:30,760
It's a starter base.

2571
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:32,760
It's enormous.

2572
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:35,160
So hopefully they'll be coming soon.

2573
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,840
And my final thought is I am fucking gagged that we made it

2574
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:41,800
through the whole episode without an Internet outage

2575
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:43,800
when I was sitting here at the very beginning going,

2576
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:46,680
well, it's probably going to be a month before we can fix.

2577
02:27:47,440 --> 02:27:52,120
Of course, if I if I say it, the opposite will be willed into existence.

2578
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:55,680
But you know what? I'll take it because I love having you folks here live

2579
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:58,240
and not having to deal with all those shitty hiccups.

2580
02:27:58,240 --> 02:27:59,880
So thank you.

2581
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:02,960
And hey, if my Internet can hold out, maybe I can squeeze in

2582
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:04,480
a few more personal streams.

2583
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:07,880
I'm probably not going to be streaming a lot a lot until I get to the new place.

2584
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:12,000
I've been wanting to say for so long that, like Alan

2585
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:14,800
and I have these ways that we're going to fix some of our problems.

2586
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:17,840
And now I can find out kind of openly talk about it, which is great.

2587
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:21,120
But it will probably slow down my personal streaming for a little bit.

2588
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:24,360
But in February, it's on. It is on.

2589
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:27,240
All right. That is going to do it.

2590
02:28:27,480 --> 02:28:30,720
Thank you again for listening to our show. Have fun gaming.

2591
02:28:31,480 --> 02:28:34,440
Everyone games and should have fun playing some games.

2592
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:37,040
Make this a welcoming space for everyone.

2593
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:41,080
We'll see you in seven days to do this all again with episode number nine hundred

2594
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:43,040
and one. I hope that sounds good.

2595
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,920
Have a great week, everybody. Good night.
