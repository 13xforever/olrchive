00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,360
This week, Meta is pushing the Metaverse even further, and the term Metaverse is going

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,560
to be the only successful thing about Meta's initiative.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,040
The legions of people who paid $1500 to Microsoft for an AR headset can do it again, now paying

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,320
Meta for what seems like good hardware and a sad lump of software.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,640
Remember, a console is only as good as its games, and hardware is only as good as the

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,840
software you run on it.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,440
This is my sarcasm dripping punditry, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,720
Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,280
Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,040
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,160
where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,960
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back and live once again with episode number 933

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,680
of our show for tonight, October the 16th of 2022.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,120
We're back after not being here last week.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,160
Dark Soccer and I were at TwitchCon, and I can't believe it's been an entire week since

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
TwitchCon.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
It almost feels like an eternity ago.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
But let me say hello.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,320
Of course, I'm Rob Roberts, and over there, of course, is the previously mentioned Dark

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,880
Soccer, or Jamie Summers.

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Hello.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Hi.

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Hi.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,680
I understand your voice is not in tip top shape tonight, but that has nothing to do

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
with TwitchCon.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
Right?

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
That's, or maybe, I don't know.

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,760
I had a sinus infection, and I can't put the thing on over my headphones, but it's part

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
of my cosplay.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Yeah.

31
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,160
So for those that are listening on our podcast feed, because we do tape live every Sunday

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,620
night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network right after the Bobby Blackwolf

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,160
show at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, so you can watch us live.

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,680
But if you, of course, listen on the podcast feed, which is available on Spotify, iTunes,

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,680
all the major podcast platforms, you don't get the visuals, sadly.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,360
But Dark Soccer was showing off a little bit of her pig cosplay, Pig being the killer from

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,860
Dead by Daylight, that's from the Saw franchise in movies.

38
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,640
So yeah.

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,360
So I will come back in just a moment, Dark Soccer, we'll talk more about TwitchCon.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,840
But first, I have to say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Hi, Loki.

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
Hello.

43
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Did you have-

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Pig being the pig from Babe.

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,240
It's a really weird game.

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,840
No, she was not cosplaying as that.

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,280
How was your week off?

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Busy.

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Yeah?

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
It's just working on video.

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,160
I was gonna say, you're pushing the Minecraft theme even harder.

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,880
I saw you put out another video.

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,880
You were doing like a team stream yesterday, right?

54
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,000
So we did kind of a commentary stream on the Minecraft live stuff.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,900
So they do their event and they have like all their announcements and everything.

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,540
So we did a co-stream with that.

58
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,000
Nice, nice.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,420
So tell us quickly, what's the latest video about over on your YouTube channel, Loki O

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,340
L R on YouTube, if you're not already following which I'm doing.

61
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,340
So my latest-

62
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,340
Yep, yep.

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:10,260
So my latest Channel 64 episode, it revolves around me trying to try out for Sheriff because

64
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,460
there's Sheriff tryouts in our town of No Water because there's pillagers constantly

65
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,220
attacking so we need a Sheriff to like wrangle those up.

66
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,380
And so I'm not prepared.

67
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,620
And so in order to get prepared and do a lot in a short amount of time, you have to have

68
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,060
a montage.

69
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,100
And so I have a montage and it's hilarious.

70
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
So there's that.

71
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,940
And then I build a multi-item sorting system.

72
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,860
So big storage rooms, store everything because it's very key to get that all organized.

73
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,820
It makes projects in the future like way easier.

74
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,420
And there's a lot of lore, there's some lore thrown in there as well.

75
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,020
But it's pretty funny.

76
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,900
Jess 7X is in our chat right now saying best intro ever, massive 80s montage box.

77
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,260
Yes, Jess 6, yes.

78
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,900
In fact, I have Jess 6's latest video playing behind me as well because I would like to

79
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,940
showcase his stuff as well to your friend of mine on the Channel 64 SMP and does some

80
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,320
just incredible builds and just really entertaining content as well.

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,740
So go check him out as well.

82
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,740
Okay.

83
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,380
We just had an Illidan moment though.

84
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,900
You are not prepared.

85
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,460
From the old school Warcraft trailer?

86
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,460
Yes.

87
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,780
It's funny because so like, not to spoil too much, but like, it's basically we've been

88
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,620
thrown around, there's like this tiny little bit of lore that like kind of got introduced

89
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,980
in Arrington's video who's also on our server.

90
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,720
And so then I incorporated something with that as well.

91
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,840
And then now I incorporate something else with it.

92
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:49,020
So it's basically these, we're finding this hidden, like technology buried in the desert

93
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
type of stuff.

94
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,200
And so there's this quantum battery thing that keeps coming up that I ended up using

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,000
to almost like give myself superpowers for a little bit.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,240
That's what the whole point is like, I don't actually train, I suck at everything.

97
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,280
But with the power of cheating, if you're a quantum battery, I'm able to do a bunch

98
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
of crazy stuff.

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,800
But yeah, it makes for a very entertaining montage.

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,020
So definitely check it out because it took forever to put that together.

101
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,880
All right, will do.

102
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,020
Okay, so I want to get into okay, so here's, here's the wild thing going on tonight.

103
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,820
There is so much breaking news happening today, like get out the duct tape, we have so much

104
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,000
breaking news that needs to be fixed.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,160
So like, usually we do like one kickoff topic or one lead topic before we do our gaming

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
weeks.

107
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,280
I think we literally have five things to talk about for you to our gaming weeks tonight.

108
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,320
So but that's fine, because there's a little less gaming news overall this week, because

109
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,740
it all dropped today.

110
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,400
So we're gonna, we're gonna get into it here in a moment here.

111
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,720
I do want to say one more time, though, for the audience this week.

112
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,840
Please excuse our voices.

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,720
Dark soccer mentioned she's sick.

114
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,440
I hosted a show here live last night, which was great.

115
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,040
I know some of you know that I on the side do some live theater and variety show hosting.

116
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,420
We had a huge show last night, but it also kind of affected my voice.

117
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,840
So Loki on the other hand is just good.

118
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,560
But but yeah, I can feel it.

119
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
I have allergies.

120
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,160
So I'm fine.

121
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
For the most part.

122
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,320
We're all old and broken.

123
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,240
So please just bear with us.

124
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,380
Yeah, Dan was in the same state as me.

125
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,760
And I mean, I think we might have both had like a cold but typically when I get a cold

126
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,320
it evolves into a sinus infection.

127
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,520
And if they don't catch it quick for me, I get bronchitis really easily.

128
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,240
So I'm on the hardcore antibiotics right now, which has the plus side of giving me good

129
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,800
skin for like a month.

130
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
All right.

131
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,540
Well, let's talk a little bit about our trip to TwitchCon.

132
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:44,720
So because we do have so much other news to talk about, I would drive Yeah, I don't want

133
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
to talk about like every single streamer we met because that's that's too much.

134
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,920
But how about maybe like, overall, let's start here overall.

135
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,080
What were your thoughts on TwitchCon?

136
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,340
And what were like your top three things from TwitchCon?

137
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:09,560
So overall in top three, fucking big, but I'd say because I didn't get to go to really

138
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,580
any of the panels because of shenanigans, I'll put it that way.

139
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,500
Because I could have gone to a panel, but I was planning for something else.

140
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,260
And then that got swept out from under me.

141
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:28,980
So I I'd say my top things are seeing all the charities represented.

142
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,100
Lots of networking opportunities to that was really great.

143
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,140
And then just getting to put faces, well, I mean, all of them, I already saw faces,

144
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:46,740
getting to put physical bodies, flesh, getting to put flesh face to the flesh.

145
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,060
But but like just getting to see all these people I've made friends with and getting

146
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,700
to see people I've already met again, you know, like like Nick and a few people.

147
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:05,740
Just getting to see people, to meet my friends, you know, who have, you know,

148
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,460
spent the last year getting to know and seeing just how real a lot of them are online.

149
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,380
You know, just about everybody was how I expected them to be.

150
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:22,100
Few people were quieter than I expected them to be, but most everybody was pretty genuine.

151
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,140
You know, it was very, very crowded, though.

152
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:37,740
I mean, it's a it's already a big place, but like I think they're.

153
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,500
I got a little bit late, got in a little bit late because I like sleep,

154
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,460
and that made it easier for me to get through the prescreening.

155
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,660
I like the idea of having the bands, but I think they could have had some sort

156
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,020
of different deployment system for it.

157
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,300
They were giving away those extra swag bags at the end of the con.

158
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,100
By the way, I got like two more of them.

159
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,820
It was funny for those that aren't aware, the wristbands were like the covid screening check,

160
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,980
like either you had a negative test or you were vaccinated.

161
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,300
But yeah, like they gave you these bands and like they didn't.

162
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,700
You had to wear it basically for three days straight like you.

163
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,580
So I just kept the thing on for three days.

164
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,020
I felt gross, like it felt like I was wearing a life alert or something.

165
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,380
It wasn't that gross.

166
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,540
I mean, seriously, it was easy to clean off.

167
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,900
You know, it was plastic.

168
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,220
It felt weird.

169
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,060
I've done it before for other cons.

170
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,140
It's not that big of a deal for me.

171
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:39,420
It was. But I certainly enjoyed cosplaying, but there weren't a lot of other cosplayers.

172
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,740
There was a few big ones like the Big Daddy.

173
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,820
Did you see? I did. Yeah.

174
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,580
And a reptar.

175
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:55,140
That was like an inflatable costume, you know, the artist room was really great,

176
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,540
except I don't know, it was I don't mind a lot of original stuff,

177
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,060
but I was seeing like some of the same fandoms represented over and over,

178
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,620
not necessarily the things that I wanted to see.

179
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,420
And then, of course, there was like the the pervy booths, which I'm not into.

180
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:19,500
I mean, there. I also just an overhearing because I mean,

181
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,860
I'll I'll predominantly the folks I hung out with were were gay and non-binary people.

182
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,100
And there was not enough eye candy for for the gay men.

183
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,540
I'm just going to say or the women who were into male bodies, I guess.

184
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,260
You know, it was very heavily marketed to the straight male gaze,

185
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,940
which is disgusting.

186
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,500
But there was a lot of like funny stuff, a lot of cute art represented,

187
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,420
a lot of really good, serious artists like the the the person that did the oil paintings of the scenes.

188
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,460
Did you go by that? I did. Yeah.

189
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:04,140
I talked to the there's a person who did hand thrown ceramics live on stream.

190
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,060
And I'm going to be putting in a commissioned order soon for my swear jar,

191
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,140
which is the more I swear, you know, the more money I have to put in there because swearing is awesome.

192
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,940
And that'll get me rich quick. But he was he's he's from Tennessee.

193
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,100
We chatted about, you know, Waffle House for a little bit.

194
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,660
And and they're a D&D person. They're like, yeah, we've got the fifth edition.

195
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:34,020
So I was like, I play second. And I got this look of.

196
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:43,860
You must like pain, like, no, I like calculators and sheets and having an actual use for, you know, a D4.

197
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:52,340
But or D3, but. Overall, people were mostly pleasant.

198
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,700
Got to actually the drag show. Oh, my fucking God, it was great.

199
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:06,260
And London was London Bradshaw. To do something that geared toward.

200
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,500
Mental health. Yeah, I loved it.

201
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,060
I love the representation of very impressive friends. I love London anyway.

202
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:22,700
And Marisol had a wonderful Marisol Awards. I felt sorry for poor deer because.

203
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,980
I don't know, it's like a first time presenting and I know how nerve nerve wracking that can be.

204
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,580
And with a crowd like that. Yeah.

205
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,340
A hosting in front of your computer is not quite the same as hosting in front of a live crowd.

206
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,700
And I'm not saying that in a shady way. I'm just saying it.

207
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,020
Yeah. Yeah. Under the circumstances, it was amazing.

208
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:47,060
Yeah. Everything you would expect there. It's just I think some things just it's it's hard to jump in.

209
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,140
You know, and I'm talking as somebody who does do live hosting in front of lots of people last night.

210
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,780
And it's one of those things was like that. I didn't I didn't just my first 20 times on stage were not beautiful.

211
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,300
You know, it's just you have to grow into that. It takes it takes practice like anything else.

212
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,700
Right. So it's probably hard to jump into that at TwitchCon for the first time.

213
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:10,860
My thing is forget there's people. Yeah, I mean, you've seen me do panels.

214
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:18,980
I'm kind of the same way with everything that I do. But I also I mean, I have I've done performances and solos and ensembles.

215
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:27,100
So I had that to bolster me for those things. But but I mean, over overall.

216
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,260
And we're going to address some of the worst parts of the con.

217
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,300
And I saw that shit coming, but I'm going to leave that be for a moment.

218
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,620
Like when we first walked by that particular thing that we're going to address, I said, oh, that's a lawsuit waiting to happen.

219
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,340
And then I wanted to kind of do it because I love American gladiators.

220
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,220
But I digress. I did network with a lot of people, different companies.

221
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,740
I got to play the new PSO2, which is OK.

222
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,820
They're like, so how long have you been playing Phantasy Star?

223
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:10,380
I'm like, since the Japanese beta of Phantasy Star online, the old one on Dreamcast.

224
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:22,060
Oh. That was funny, like and I'm sorry, just on a purely petty, selfish.

225
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:28,740
What's what I'm thinking of? I guess kind of like tooting my own heart thing.

226
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,140
My skincare routine is completely paid off because nobody believed my age.

227
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,580
I felt especially the person who asked me if I was 26.

228
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:48,540
Thank you. Yeah, off by 20 years, we were definitely some of the old we were definitely some of the older people at TwitchCon, but not the oldest.

229
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,180
I saw some other folks there that were clearly older than we were and props to them.

230
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,380
I hope I still have the drive to do that stuff when I'm in my 50s and 60s.

231
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,740
I did meet up with the folks from Mix It Up Bot and they they're awesome.

232
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:15,300
We talked a bit about Mac support and talk about Stadia going down and how moving to Boosteroid for things and just talk about more Mac integration for some of those things.

233
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,300
And I've offered to beta test a few things.

234
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,540
Met up with the guy who created Blerp, which is what I use for sound redeems on my channel now.

235
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:34,540
And it's just got to meet like a lot of creators who do behind the scenes stuff as much as the people in front of the camera.

236
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,260
And people don't understand when you start streaming.

237
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:45,340
I mean, you don't need a lot to start. You basically need either a computer or a phone or a console.

238
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:51,460
A lot of consoles have now. Yeah, I talk to people who do phone streaming, stream their games from their phones.

239
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,140
I have the apps for it. I just haven't bothered.

240
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,580
But people who do, they're just chatting streams all directly through their phones or their iPad.

241
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:05,300
And you don't need a lot. You don't need a lot of money to start.

242
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,900
It's free applications. You remember how shitty my first webcam was.

243
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:19,420
But I mean, for me, I've done 90 percent of my graphics, video editing and music on my channel.

244
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,820
It's a lot of work. Imagine having to pay somebody for that.

245
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:30,100
But these apps that mix it up, they don't make anything off of it. It's free and it's really good.

246
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:36,460
Not like using some of the extreme labs where they charge you a premium for shit you can get for free online.

247
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:46,060
So kudos to them. The stream, what is it, the stream Raiders people had like a stream pirates thing.

248
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,740
It was kind of cool. Oh, that's that's their new thing, their new game that they're showing off.

249
00:16:50,740 --> 00:17:02,580
But I just liked meeting more of the people who do stuff to support streamers and they have a thankless job mostly.

250
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:12,420
And y'all are the lifeblood of a successful streamer. And kudos to all of you who do this stuff from behind the scenes.

251
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,780
Transitioning from that into some of my thoughts on the show floor and stuff,

252
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,700
I thought like, you know, as far as what I got out of the show floor and some of the exhibits and so forth,

253
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,580
I actually found I had a very similar experience to the very first time I went to TwitchCon.

254
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:32,780
Because remember, our voiceover guy, Jason, invited me on a whim the first year and I went to TwitchCon for a day.

255
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,860
And I wasn't very immersed in Twitch culture. I knew about it.

256
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,740
But I learned a lot about like streaming and some of the like behind the scenes stuff is very informative.

257
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,180
That that first year I went, I would say from that perspective, I got a similar thing.

258
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,340
I think there were a lot of things on the show floor that were meh, like, you know, like the the foam pit,

259
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,340
which yes, we'll talk more about in a minute, like just some silly stuff, like the giant games were kind of fun.

260
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,580
The giant Wendy's booth, which you know, okay, cool.

261
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,060
Wendy's is a sponsor and they were given away grape frosty is this like a limited time thing?

262
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,460
Ew.

263
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,420
I mean, but I'm diabetic. I can't have them anyway.

264
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,020
The Capital One thing there too, but Twitch has a partnership with them.

265
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,740
But I get it. They're all sponsors and they're paying for it. So they get a little space.

266
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,900
There was the Velveeta booth and that was great. They had a ball pit with Velveeta.

267
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,020
Yeah. So so little packets of Velveeta shells and cheese.

268
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,020
You know, and there were a few game companies like Sega was there, obviously, with the fantasy star

269
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,180
and they were showing off the like a dragon, like reboot of the Dreamcast game and all that.

270
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:41,580
And then they like Street Fighter six definitely had a presence there because there's no, I watched others play, but I didn't want to wait.

271
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,900
Honestly, playing on a hand controller was kind of crappy.

272
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:53,940
I gave up after one match because it hurt playing on the the the eight button controller, though, that was fun.

273
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,860
Yeah. And the new girl, Kimberly, is great. Let's hope that later.

274
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,660
So so so like my top things, I would say I loved the drag show.

275
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,700
You know, obviously, Dark Soccer and I have our drag spinoff talks and so forth.

276
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:20,660
But I was I was just so happy that they spotlighted that type of queer content literally front and center right after the opening ceremony of the opening keynote, which I I'm not going to say the opening keynote was a letdown.

277
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,580
I thought the charity donations were nice.

278
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,300
I thought, you know, there was a lot of like, OK, yay, Twitch type of stuff built into it.

279
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,580
But I was very surprised how little wows there were in it.

280
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,660
And I'm I'm really shocked at how Amazon clearly seems to operate as a siloed company.

281
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,300
And I this is something that if I ran Amazon, I don't.

282
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:45,340
But if I ran Amazon, I would really be trying to break down some of these silos because Amazon feels like an incredibly siloed company to me.

283
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:51,460
And you see that when Twitch talks about being charged by their own company for bandwidth and how much that whole thing costs.

284
00:19:52,100 --> 00:20:03,620
And I think this opening keynote, like what a missed opportunity to showcase Amazon Luna or anything relating to Prime Gaming or anything related to, you know, other types of nerd content.

285
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:13,500
Like, I was just shocked at how much Amazon fails to utilize things that might be relevant and exciting to their captive audience that paid to be there.

286
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,860
So I think it's a big fail on not Twitch's part, Amazon's part.

287
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,420
And that's that's Amazon operating in silos.

288
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,220
And I think they're going to regret not taking advantage of that type of stuff sooner, to be quite honest, in my opinion.

289
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,620
But back to the drag show, the good news.

290
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:39,140
I was so happy that they spotlighted something like that front and center because I loved the Twitch kind of like put their metaphorical weight behind that.

291
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:51,540
And the importance that something like Twitch was to the drag community who remember lost bars and clubs for at least a year, if not longer, which is a big income source for many of these folks.

292
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,220
And I also kind of love the fact that the drag people they were showcasing.

293
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:05,180
And this is this is absolutely no shade to the fabulous queens that are on this platform as a result of larger exposure on a show like Drag Race.

294
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,940
I love Ongina, Detox, very talented Trixie Mattel even streams on here once in a while.

295
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,860
These are all fantastic people.

296
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,700
However, I love that none of them were involved in the drag show.

297
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,300
And the focus was really on people that really made their headway on Twitch.

298
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,340
You could argue that Bitch Puddin kind of because she was the winner of Dragula season two.

299
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:42,100
But I do think Bitch Puddin sort of has that card of hey, I threw that weight from winning Dragula behind putting on these digital shows and using my name and my resources to bring everyone else exposure.

300
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,780
And for that reason, she absolutely deserved a seat at that table.

301
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,740
And I thought she did a great job hosting.

302
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,860
Yeah, and I do think that she was a fantastic choice of a host.

303
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,580
Yes, you need that big name as a host.

304
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,820
No notes, no notes.

305
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,620
I'm yeah.

306
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,540
And I love that they showcased queens.

307
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,340
I think there were two kings.

308
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,820
There's non binary individual in there as well.

309
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,420
I love that kind of ran the gamut.

310
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,820
I loved you know, some of the performances were so so good.

311
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,860
Rose Evergreen, Alan Vanmotor, like was like that was amazing.

312
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,580
And that does and if you haven't seen it, it's all on the video on demand.

313
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,180
And just, it was just fun.

314
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,980
And it was fun to be in the room and feel that energy and so forth.

315
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:37,820
And like you said, London Bradshaw, I thought their approach to the whole thing and really, really utilizing AV, all the other performers did things that were elevated like club and like RuPaul worked the world types of things on a big stage.

316
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,260
Again, nothing wrong with that.

317
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,540
It was fantastic.

318
00:22:41,700 --> 00:23:01,220
What London did, incorporating the AV intelligently and intentionally into their act, and giving a shout out to so many other people through that method and tying that all into the overarching thing about what the pandemic did to our mental health and how Twitch was able to tie into that.

319
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,220
I mean, gold star tens, tens, tens across the board.

320
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,700
I don't know what the fuck you else to say.

321
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,500
Like, that was incredible.

322
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,140
And I'm so happy with what they did.

323
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,500
And really, everybody, everybody did great.

324
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:20,660
Well, and on top of that, as just as a streamer, London is hilarious.

325
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,580
I mean, doing a lot more GTA roleplay stuff lately.

326
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:24,940
Yeah.

327
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,580
But just absolutely wonderful to watch.

328
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,380
And back when they were doing DBD, that was also a lot of fun.

329
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,580
Let's see if I'm looking at a top three.

330
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,180
So that would definitely be like, one of my top number to have like top 11.

331
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,940
I know one of my other top would be Well, here's the thing.

332
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:51,100
And here's in general, what I like about TwitchCon is that I like the element of, hey, let's all agree, we're going to be in the same place at the same time.

333
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,820
And let's be real, you didn't need Twitch necessarily to do that.

334
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,740
I'm sure we all well, sorry, let me backtrack.

335
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,820
Twitch, yes, was instrumental in us all meeting each other.

336
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,140
But we didn't necessarily need them to put on the party.

337
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:13,060
And we knew we know so many people that went and didn't really go to TwitchCon.

338
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,380
They were just like, gonna be in San Diego and hang out with folks that weekend or what have you.

339
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,580
Still pissed about missing the Kim Petras concert.

340
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,580
Oh, yeah.

341
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,980
I mean, it's whatever.

342
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,300
It's, you know, I think that was-

343
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,340
A spaghetti factory, although I understand, but still are.

344
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,500
I, yeah.

345
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,100
Anyway, it was Cheesecake Factory, not spaghetti factory.

346
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,420
90 minute wait.

347
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,420
We were quoted 60.

348
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,340
But anyway, I'm not I'm not going to go full Chad on this program.

349
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,980
So it is what it is.

350
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,380
They were short staff.

351
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,780
We already had a Karen there anyway.

352
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,140
Yeah.

353
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:43,900
Let's see.

354
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,020
I also really enjoyed the panels that I did go to.

355
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,700
I'm sad about the one I missed.

356
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,020
They're well, they're all online.

357
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,580
You can go watch them all on demand.

358
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,060
And I thought-

359
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,500
The tax one was, I thought, really a good one to have.

360
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,940
Some of them could have done better.

361
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,540
Again, just because you're great on Twitch doesn't mean you're great

362
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,580
in front of a crowd and you have to prepare for a panel in a certain way.

363
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,340
I went to a panel that I felt was two really good panels

364
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,260
smushed into one panel where the two panels kind of attacked each other

365
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,780
and no message stood out as a result.

366
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,580
So there were things, there's definitely room for improvement in that regard.

367
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,580
But there were some good panels that I went to.

368
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,940
Actually, I thought the one that was the most fascinating was the one

369
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,700
that Twitch staff put on themselves about how to get recognized

370
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,820
on the Twitch platform and, you know, what kind of goes into getting discovered.

371
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,740
And there was a lot that I like kind of knew.

372
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,660
But one big takeaway I got from that panel was

373
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,420
schedule your streams best you can, which is something I don't like doing

374
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,820
because I don't like kind of committing in that regard

375
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,060
because I don't want Twitch to be my third job.

376
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,380
I want Twitch to be a fun thing in the side.

377
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,860
But my God-

378
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,740
And I started from the get go.

379
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,780
Twitch is leaning into those so much.

380
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,060
And like, for an example, for those of you that are watching live on Twitch

381
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,580
right now, like there's this new shout out feature that you can use.

382
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,980
So you can shout out another streamer.

383
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,580
So if I were to actually do a shout out here

384
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,380
and I'm going to do that in the chat so you can see this,

385
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,980
it'll actually show

386
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,860
that here's here they are and here's the follow button to follow them.

387
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,020
Now, I don't think Bobby had any stream schedule.

388
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,020
I shouted out Bobby.

389
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,380
So I don't think he has any streams actually scheduled that are coming up.

390
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,900
But if he does, you would see it right there below.

391
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,860
So you can like bookmark it and know it's coming up and so forth.

392
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,620
So it's it's like that is now the new like native shout out feature

393
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,180
that's built in.

394
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,940
So you don't have to use Nightbot or anything like that.

395
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,060
But like they're also showing schedules of people you follow,

396
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,580
like on the front page.

397
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,300
That's something they're going to be adding and so on and so on.

398
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,420
So I just I you know, again, I don't love the idea of scheduling everything,

399
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,820
but I'm going to try

400
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,060
because I think this is a really important thing to be leveraging.

401
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,220
So that was something I got out of a panel.

402
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,340
And then I guess that's three things.

403
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,020
That was, you know, the people, the panel.

404
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,140
So here's here's here's the thing.

405
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,740
Would I pay the two hundred dollars to go to TwitchCon again?

406
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,060
I'm not sure.

407
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,060
I'm not sure I needed to be there all three days.

408
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,940
And maybe part of that is because I use the trip as an excuse

409
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,500
to see my muggle friends who have nothing to do at Twitch.

410
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,140
You know, as like my one of my closest friends who used to be my roommate

411
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,500
back when this show was in the garage studio, when we were on Justin TV.

412
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,140
My roommate from that era lives in San Diego now.

413
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,740
So we met up in Hillcrest for brunch one day and had nothing to do at TwitchCon.

414
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,660
And I enjoyed doing things like that, too.

415
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,460
And so I kind of feel like, you know what I would like.

416
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,100
And I think back to the year I went with Jason

417
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,780
and I was like, I got a lot out of one day.

418
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,500
I got a lot out of just walking the show floor and doing the one day.

419
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,340
So I feel like next year, maybe I'll do all three days.

420
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,460
But like, I would get a lot out of just going for one day

421
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,380
and doing as many panels as I can and making sure I pick the day

422
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,780
that the drag showcase is also on is the day I would want to attend the convention.

423
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,700
But yeah, I'm doing all three again.

424
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,660
As far as meeting people, I was also kind of surprised

425
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,860
like how quickly I met people.

426
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,700
And like, there's just this nature of people.

427
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,540
This is a big lesson I learned, a big lesson I learned.

428
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,780
There is a nature for people, even when meeting in person,

429
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,300
to hang out within their clicks.

430
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,260
And I'm not using that in a negative way.

431
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,540
I completely understand.

432
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,100
People are introverted.

433
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,420
People are extroverted introverts and so forth.

434
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,060
It takes a lot.

435
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,180
Not everybody can reach out to somebody

436
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,020
the same way they can online when they're necessarily in person.

437
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,060
And people gravitate towards hanging within their clicks in person.

438
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,180
So I sort of felt like for that reason, I wasn't really mingling

439
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,820
with people that I've kind of lurked in their streams for a long time.

440
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,260
And that was a big lesson to me.

441
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,700
I need to stop lurking in streams.

442
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,740
That set me back when it came to really meeting and talking to people

443
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,380
and like being able to chat with people like wholeheartedly at TwitchCon,

444
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,900
because and a lot of this is because, you know, I own it

445
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,980
for a long time before I lived in this place and I lived at the old house.

446
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,060
It was easy for me to watch Twitch on the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One,

447
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,020
where it's very difficult to chat.

448
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,420
You don't chat with a controller.

449
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,620
Yes, I can get out my phone and chat that way, but that's a pain in the butt.

450
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,780
I don't want to do that.

451
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,340
So I need to make sure that I lurk less

452
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,340
and talk more, even if it's hi, lol, nice play

453
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,740
or the number one thing that streamers love making clips.

454
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,540
Make a clip of a good moment.

455
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,620
Streamers will remember you for that. That's for sure.

456
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,220
So that's that's kind of a big thing I took away for me is that

457
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,860
I need to make sure I'm participating in Twitch and not just lurking,

458
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,580
because then when it comes to stuff like this, like people don't have a lot

459
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,500
to talk about.

460
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,500
And it's you know, it's just something I just kind of notice.

461
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,260
And I think that's one thing where I feel like Twitch might be able

462
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,300
to improve a con the next year and make it a little more attractive.

463
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,060
Even though yes, Dark Soccer, I understand like the networking.

464
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,140
I think you use networking in a way of like meeting and mingling

465
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,180
with the people that you you know,

466
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,740
because you you've done that immersion in Twitch culture in a way I did it.

467
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,540
And I will fully, fully, you know, say that up front.

468
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,340
I think where Twitch could have done better

469
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,980
is create more intentional places to network with new people.

470
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,540
And I thought one place to do that would have been the LGBTQ meetup

471
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,140
the first day.

472
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,140
It was just a room full of clicks.

473
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,420
Again, I'm not using that in a negative context.

474
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,300
I understand people want to meet their viewers and their peoples

475
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,020
and the people they raid all the time for the first time.

476
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,700
How much better would an event have been that was designed

477
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,380
to intentionally meet and greet new LGBTQ streamers

478
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,100
you haven't worked with before or whatever?

479
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,780
You know, that's that's the content for me, for you out there listening.

480
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,900
If you're not a part of the LGBT community, what if that is like,

481
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,660
you know, Latin streamers?

482
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,220
I know how to meet up Asian-American Pacific Islander streamers

483
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,900
had their own meet up.

484
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,060
San Diego locals had their own meet up.

485
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,300
There is a group that you fit into somewhere in there.

486
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,380
And I think if those have been more intentionally networking events

487
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,660
and like somebody could have been on a microphone and been like, OK,

488
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,980
pick a card when you go into the room.

489
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,140
Now go to a table.

490
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,420
All of the diamonds over here, all of the hearts over here.

491
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,940
Tell us, give us the elevator pitch about your stream.

492
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,420
OK, now we're going to mix it up.

493
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,580
All the aces go over here.

494
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,340
All the twos go over here. All the threes go over here.

495
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,060
Tell us about a video game you really enjoy streaming and why.

496
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,780
And like have those prompt topics to like really get people talking and mingling.

497
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,540
How much better would that have been to really meet and grow your network?

498
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,060
And that's why it's like Twitch speed dating.

499
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,380
But, you know, without the dating, it is maybe that's what they needed.

500
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,940
Sort of mentorship program.

501
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,020
I think they did have that, but it was so popular

502
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,860
and in a small room and not a spotlight in the con.

503
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,340
I doubt people knew it was there, to be honest.

504
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:11,820
I am. So, oh, pod culture sounds like a cool way to mix.

505
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,180
Look, Twitch, I humbly nominate myself to run some of your networking panels next year

506
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,180
because not to give away the job of what I do for a living,

507
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,900
but like this sort of how to meet new people on the first day at a new job, let's say

508
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,020
is something I'm very well versed in.

509
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,980
So anyway, I just I think that's the opportunity.

510
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,060
Twitch Con is great for networking with the people you already know.

511
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,620
Twitch Con today is not great for networking with people you don't.

512
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,060
I think that you should reach out to them and offer.

513
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,220
I really do. I'll do that.

514
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,180
I will. Bobby, clip it.

515
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,020
Hold me accountable.

516
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,860
I'll be on your ass for it.

517
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,740
I think it's a great idea.

518
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,180
No, I appreciate it. Thank you so much.

519
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,620
All right. So let's talk about we've been alluding to it.

520
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,140
Let's talk about that thing that did make the news.

521
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,340
So I'm sure you've heard.

522
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:07,300
But in case you haven't, Twitch Con, Lenovo, they're all in a bit of hot water

523
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,340
because there was a booth that they had set up that resulted in some major injuries.

524
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,540
They had an American gladiator.

525
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,580
If you remember the game Joust from American Gladiators, where people stand up on pedestals

526
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,180
and kind of knock themselves around with big foam sticks, they had this thing set up.

527
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,540
It was almost like shield style.

528
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,540
Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, all right, this was set up and then there was a big foam pit

529
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,780
that you would fall into, you know, you get knocked down.

530
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,300
But here's the thing.

531
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,780
That foam pit, I mean, for that type of fall looked a little bit shallow.

532
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,980
I'm not sure a bunch of foam cubes are really going to break the fall

533
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,140
the way a foam mat would.

534
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,700
It's actually very deceptive because they use cubes like that for jumping.

535
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,860
Actually, I'll use something that you've seen Drag Race.

536
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,300
Sure. And they use a deep foam pit to catch people.

537
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,700
They do it sometimes for for larger falling stunts because it's a more

538
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,740
what's the word I'm thinking of?

539
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,460
It'll conform a little bit more to the shape of a body.

540
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,020
Right. However, it was deceptive.

541
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,580
If you go by it and how elevated it looked like it was,

542
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,020
it seemed like it was deeper than it was.

543
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,740
But even so, I was saying that that's a lawsuit waiting to happen.

544
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,980
People are going to hurt themselves.

545
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,220
Someone's going to punch someone in the face with that thing

546
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,700
and break their glasses into their eyeball or something.

547
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,820
I'm I'm thinking of Carrie, too.

548
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,460
But anyway, the way they're supposed to be set up is they're supposed to be

549
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,460
at least like four to six feet deep with the foam cubes and have like

550
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,460
almost like a trampoline on the bottom, like some sort of thing that has give.

551
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,300
Whereas this looked like it was about two feet.

552
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,980
Maybe it was and solid concrete in the bottom.

553
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,660
Now, granted.

554
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,380
I would say that, especially for

555
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,900
Adriana, the girl who broke her back.

556
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,700
Yeah, I was I was going to get to that, but we don't want to tangent.

557
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,540
So let me just say a notable streamer, Adriana Czeclik,

558
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,380
suffered a back injury on Sunday.

559
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,460
And it was, you know, the videos everywhere.

560
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,580
And, you know, I did a full on cheerleader jump off that thing.

561
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,460
Yeah, she did.

562
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,660
But, you know, she thought it was safe to, you know, a safe landing there. Right.

563
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,780
So but she wasn't the only one that hurt herself.

564
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,340
So if you think, you know, she was silly for jumping off,

565
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,820
she really wasn't the only one that hurt herself.

566
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,380
Locke Van Ness sent a tweet with a picture of her in a wheelchair

567
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,060
recovering from an injury that she sustained and so on and so on.

568
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,300
In a statement, there were other people.

569
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,340
Yeah. In a statement, Twitch said, We are aware of the incidence of Twitch

570
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,460
com visitors who sustained injuries in the gladiator game soft foam pit

571
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,700
at the Lenovo booth.

572
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,140
The area has since been closed for any further use

573
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,620
while we work with event organizers to look into the incidents.

574
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,900
Well, that's probably a long time.

575
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,700
They probably should have done that after the first incident.

576
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,700
But it is what it is, I guess.

577
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,140
That's that's what they said.

578
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,900
And I don't think the waivers are going to do either company a lick of good.

579
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,820
No, it's negligence.

580
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,900
They didn't follow proper procedure.

581
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,060
I mean, granted, and this is just the side note.

582
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,860
I don't think I would have done a full on

583
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,060
cheerleader jump into this ambiguous pile of foam.

584
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,060
Mm hmm. But at the same time,

585
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,140
I'll admit it look deceptively deep. Yeah.

586
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,580
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says waivers don't matter

587
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,140
when there's negligence in building the thing.

588
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,580
And yeah, I think that's what it's really going to come down to, to be honest.

589
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,860
Now, the other side.

590
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,740
This is also why, by the way, conventions have to carry insurance.

591
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,340
So I mean, here's the at the end of the day, people are like,

592
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,300
is Twitch going to go bankrupt because of these lawsuits?

593
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,860
They're insured trust in that whole thing.

594
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,620
However, it TwitchCon premiums, TwitchCon ticket prices

595
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,780
will go up next year to cover the new insurance premiums.

596
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,580
That's where this goes.

597
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,900
Well, but at any rate, though, you saw the Wendy's side, right,

598
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,940
where they had just like the long half tube,

599
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:12,620
and it gave more surface area and it was a more on the level.

600
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,740
They weren't well elevated above it.

601
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,020
It would have been just like, you know, stumbling on a path if someone fell.

602
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,980
That one, I think, was better handled.

603
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,700
And I don't think a lot of people got really injured off of the Wendy's one.

604
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,380
Yeah, because it I mean, there was some people really going at each other,

605
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,660
but it was a lot more to code, I think.

606
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,260
I'm just going to break it down.

607
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,820
I think those types of physical challenge things are corny

608
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,420
and not needed on the TwitchCon for in the first place.

609
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,460
Maybe I'm just the wrong audience. I'm too old.

610
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,020
You know, OK, boomer or whatever.

611
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,260
Heard on the balloon game.

612
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,340
I just I think that type of stuff just is a waste of space,

613
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,980
to be quite honest, on the TwitchCon floor.

614
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,020
It's also very negligent anyways, because like imagine like

615
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,260
so we had her jump in into the pit, but like.

616
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,540
People are known to dive into those things like someone could have died

617
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,660
in that thing. Yeah. So

618
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,860
well, we'll see what develops, because I mean,

619
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,340
there's certainly going to be a lawsuit.

620
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,300
There hasn't been one yet.

621
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,420
And I don't know who's if she, Adriana does it or what.

622
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,740
They all do it a class action.

623
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,620
I don't know. They're there.

624
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,820
There will be lawsuits.

625
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,740
There will be and there will be settlements as a result.

626
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,140
And we will never find out the details because that is how these things

627
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,180
always go. Yeah. Count on it.

628
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,300
Breaking your back like that is a lifelong injury.

629
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,860
She's going to be dealing with that forever.

630
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,860
She already says she has nerve damage done to her bladder because of it.

631
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,940
They have to fuse bones

632
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,060
in. She's undergone several surgeries already.

633
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,580
Like it's horrible. That's ridiculous. Yeah.

634
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,980
All right. Well,

635
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,820
I hope she is able to recover as much as possible

636
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,140
in the coming days and weeks and so forth.

637
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,460
And that's really unfortunate.

638
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,020
And one one of the others was about this balloon game.

639
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,180
And I'm sure we've all played it, you know, with our friends.

640
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,220
We just try to keep the balloon in the air.

641
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,180
But there were other people who got injured with that

642
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,300
because there were obstacles in the room in the form of furniture.

643
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,580
And I saw people just diving over shit to try to get that.

644
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,780
And it just it just wasn't great.

645
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,940
S.H.A. 100 Matt says, I mean, they couldn't do a dunk

646
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,540
your favorite streamer in the dunk tank for charity.

647
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,100
Sure, sure. Put it in the Wendy's booth and dunk them in a great frosty.

648
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,940
No, I'm kidding.

649
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,220
That would not be good.

650
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,380
That would not be good here.

651
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,340
Look, for example, the stream Raiders people, Captain TV,

652
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,620
they had a makeshift like Plinko game that was clearly put together

653
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:46,220
in someone's spare time to give away T-shirts that I fully endorse.

654
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,100
That's that's how you do it.

655
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,180
A cheesy little Price is Right rip off game.

656
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,580
Nobody's going to be.

657
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,460
That is how you do something to get people over in your booth.

658
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,420
Or they guess that sound effect,

659
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,780
the way they played a game I really never played.

660
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,500
Sound effect, but oh, that was the blurb.

661
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,020
That was the blurb booth.

662
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,940
I didn't see that.

663
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,500
You had to guess three sound effects and you got to spin a wheel.

664
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,700
And they started off with Skyrim, of which I've played once.

665
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,500
But but I I that was how I got in touch with the creator

666
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,220
and we ended up chatting for a good minute.

667
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,260
There was a booth that had a makeshift press

668
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,460
your luck game that got my attention instantly.

669
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,740
But now and I'm going to be honest and sorry to those,

670
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,780
I couldn't tell you who they were.

671
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,340
I knew they said they were promoting something that was like a OBS,

672
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,540
but better because it had built in games and stuff.

673
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,460
But the demo they showed me like did not show me any of the built in games.

674
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,660
They had me play a makeshift press your luck.

675
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,500
And then it was like whatever squares I would land on would be things

676
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,780
they would show me, like make your own GIF and things like this.

677
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,420
And I was like, I thought I was excited because I was like,

678
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,980
oh, I would love to do like a vog game night with press

679
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,060
your luck and video game trivia, like tell me more.

680
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,020
And that's not the impression I got from that booth at all.

681
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,380
So maybe I maybe I read it wrong.

682
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,100
I need to look into it.

683
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,100
I didn't even see that, nor did I see the Plinko.

684
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,780
I mean, it's just it was way in the corner.

685
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,340
It was tucked away in the congested things were.

686
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:18,340
And I'm also sad, though, that I mean, they're just

687
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,180
I think that the traffic could have also been better

688
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,900
routed and that they needed more exits on the.

689
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,500
I mean, they opened them up later, but the first day they didn't.

690
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,740
The the way they routed traffic in the building was ridiculous, too.

691
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,100
Like you had to walk all the way down, loop around, come back.

692
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,100
Like it was just all all this extra walking.

693
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,780
There was another escalator and an open elevator.

694
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,060
Oh, my gosh. But it was all the way on the ballroom side.

695
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,500
I can't believe San Diego Comic-Con is at that same convention center.

696
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,380
Like now that I've been there, I'm like, how did they do Comic-Con here?

697
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,300
This I felt like that place was too.

698
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,100
I mean, granted, they probably weren't using it all.

699
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,340
But I know they weren't using it all.

700
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,020
But it's like this place felt small to me.

701
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,660
But for something like that. But anyway, I digress.

702
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,940
We have a lot of other news to get into.

703
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,940
So if you want to hear more about TwitchCon, I know Dark Soccer

704
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,260
has talked about it on her stream.

705
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,140
I've talked about it on my stream. And of course, I barely have.

706
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,740
We'll, you know, talk about whatever you want and gossip more later in the week.

707
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,020
For now, though, we have a lot of breaking news, as I mentioned before.

708
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,700
Just a couple hours ago, a pretty big one that just a pretty big,

709
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,380
big bombshell that just landed variety deadline.

710
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,140
These are, you know, newspapers and traditional magazines

711
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,300
that report on things that are going on in the TV and film industry.

712
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,980
They're pretty renowned in Hollywood.

713
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,820
And they've announced that G4 is shutting down.

714
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,940
Now, there's no end date.

715
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,100
There's no there's not going to be a nice send off this time.

716
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,980
Like there was the first time G4 is done effective immediately.

717
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,900
Forty five staff members of G4 TV unfortunately lost their jobs.

718
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,820
And some of them found out because this letter that apparently

719
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:05,860
Comcast spectator chairman and CEO Dave Scott cited

720
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,620
or distributed, not everybody had received yet,

721
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,660
which just goes to show the incompetence of management once again,

722
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,140
ruining something that was a nice thing for some people.

723
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,820
And from the get go, this whole fucking thing was confusing.

724
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,820
Like and I've said this before, and I know I know G4 had it says,

725
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,340
I'm not knocking the programming.

726
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,540
I'm knocking the way it was managed by Comcast. Once again.

727
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,980
Why the fuck wasn't it a dedicated network on Peacock?

728
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,740
Like, how siloed is the company running?

729
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,500
Or did they even have it streaming available?

730
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,540
That was the thing. It was weird.

731
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,420
It was like this is only on cable.

732
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,060
But it wasn't actual G4 on Pluto.

733
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,260
It was like a selections of G4 on like it didn't make sense.

734
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,500
Like and then it was like you had some stuff on YouTube or Twitch.

735
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,900
It was like like because we have we know we have to compete with that crowd.

736
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,620
But we also want to be a traditional cable network.

737
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,020
What the fuck are you G4?

738
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,100
It was a problem from the beginning. I'm sorry.

739
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,540
I know the network had fans. I know people that work there.

740
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,420
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be a bitch.

741
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:13,460
It's just it was mismanaged from the beginning.

742
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,900
And it's and this is this.

743
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,220
This is the sad end to it all.

744
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,860
And I'm sorry to the fans.

745
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:27,620
But this should also be a warning for all cable traditional networks as far as I'm concerned.

746
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,380
Because this is just accelerated because G4 is related to tech.

747
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,340
But you know where the eyes are going.

748
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,220
The eyes are going online.

749
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,860
The eyes are going to YouTube.

750
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,020
The eyes are going to the streaming services.

751
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,100
Traditional cable does not have much time left.

752
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:51,860
And as I've said so many times before on this show, the more widespread 5G gets, more and more people are going to cut the cord with cable.

753
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,380
I don't have traditional cable anymore.

754
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,500
I've made that no secret on this show.

755
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,980
Something I haven't talked about a lot on this show.

756
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,900
I'm going to bring this up.

757
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:08,900
When I was young, long time ago, old man Roberts, seven when I was 16, 17, 18 years old, I had a public access television show.

758
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,100
Does anyone know what a public access show is today?

759
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,580
15 Wayne's World.

760
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,780
You all do because you were also 15, 16 when I was.

761
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,580
But very few people even know what a public access show is these days.

762
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,180
Why?

763
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,340
Go watch Wayne's World.

764
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,300
Yeah, Wayne's World.

765
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,100
Although Wayne's World wasn't exactly what we were doing.

766
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,660
But and I also understand public access still exists in some very large markets.

767
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:39,540
But you have to understand public access is as niche of a thing as artists releasing their albums on cassette tapes in the year 2022.

768
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,860
That's the kind of niche thing public access is.

769
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,780
People are doing it again, but the same way they're doing vinyl and it is very niche.

770
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,780
But it's a niche, right?

771
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,860
It's hilarious.

772
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:55,500
So but that's the thing is that public access doesn't exist anymore.

773
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,020
For the most part, 99% doesn't exist anymore.

774
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,620
Why?

775
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,180
Because it all went to YouTube.

776
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:07,900
You do everything online or Twitch or one of the other video on demand competitors that's out there.

777
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:16,220
Like the novelty of having your own show on television and learning how to edit tapes, you know, do editing a tape that that's all gone.

778
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,340
You have computer programs that are very easily available to do all of that now.

779
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,060
You don't need to use fancy equipment anymore.

780
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,260
That is true.

781
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,300
It's all free, too.

782
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,500
Some of it is that Lightroom is.

783
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,180
Yeah, there's there's a bunch that do that.

784
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,540
Da Vinci.

785
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,140
Yeah, Resolve is a good one.

786
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,260
Anybody that has an Apple device already has iMovie.

787
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:40,620
You know, there's that VXJ6V in chat says Tom Green started to show on public access before fame.

788
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,660
Yeah, there was another one that moved to MTV.

789
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:49,300
That was actually a lot of their like 90s content shifted over from public access.

790
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,660
I want to say Siffle and Ollie was a public access thing, too.

791
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,380
I may be wrong.

792
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,900
It sure felt like one, though.

793
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,660
Zen Monkey 11 says it wasn't mismanaged just ahead of its time.

794
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,660
They had a good thing going.

795
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,700
It will be back soon.

796
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,060
I'm sorry, as I know you were a fan.

797
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,820
I'm going to agree to disagree with you on this.

798
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,820
It was mismanaged.

799
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,340
And if you want to see my proof.

800
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,900
Go read the article.

801
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,540
This news is the proof.

802
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,580
It was mismanaged.

803
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,260
And I'm sorry, I know you are a fan.

804
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,980
And that's a hard thing to say.

805
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:28,460
And I'm not going to many of those people, especially the ones that are full time Twitch streamers, pro wrestlers in the industry somewhere else, they will absolutely bounce back do their own thing.

806
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,140
There's going to be plenty of content in that same vein that you will be able to watch.

807
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,180
But Comcast could not wrangle that into a traditional television channel.

808
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,180
And my proof is what we just talked about.

809
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:46,900
So let's see other in chat.

810
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,540
Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says this shutdown was especially mismanaged.

811
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,660
Everyone got fired at three thirty on a Sunday, and most of them learned about it through Twitter articles.

812
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,340
That's the height of mismanagement.

813
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,980
Thank you.

814
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:03,100
That is thank you for putting that succinctly as a tangible example of yes, there was mismanagement going on.

815
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,060
And so that's that's that's what it is.

816
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,500
But again, I think a lot of those talented people will bounce right back.

817
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:19,820
And probably what are what are most people doing when their shows and so forth on traditional cable get canceled?

818
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,460
What do they do?

819
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,820
They go start a podcast.

820
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,980
They start a YouTube and file for unemployment.

821
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:29,340
They start a or they spin off something on to like a streaming service or something like that.

822
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:47,180
Or are they I mean, these are very talented individuals that should be able to do something outside of, you know, cable TV or how you have people like Leo Laporte, who they're still doing this week in tech, just, you know, not on tech TV.

823
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,620
They're on their own network that they've made example.

824
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,220
Yeah.

825
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,700
And that's that's where many of these talented folks are ultimately going to end up.

826
00:48:54,700 --> 00:49:01,220
And I encourage those of you that were fans of G4, please support them wherever they go and wherever they end up.

827
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,740
That's the best thing you can do.

828
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,540
All right, um, continued breaking news tonight.

829
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,340
Earlier, actually, it's a few hours old at this point.

830
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,300
But Loki, why don't you break this one down?

831
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,860
What we have an announcement of announcement, right?

832
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:32,420
Konami dusted off their Twitter account to basically let us know that the latest updates for the Silent Hill series will be revealed during the Silent Hill transmission on Wednesday, October 19th at 2pm Pacific Standard Time or Daylight Time.

833
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:44,260
Um, I'm expecting disappointment because of Konami, but I will check it out just to see what it is.

834
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,900
But like, my expectations can't be lower.

835
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:54,660
Yeah, I've been saying for a while now it's time for Konami to shit or get off the pot when it comes to Silent Hill.

836
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,860
So I'm really glad we're going to get an information dump on October 19th.

837
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,460
But, you know, we'll I have my expectations are also very low.

838
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,980
But I would love to be proven wrong.

839
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:13,100
I think the best thing that can happen in this scenario is Konami teaming up with the right partners.

840
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:21,780
For example, there's that long standing rumor that they've partnered up with the Bloober team, the ones that did the medium that to do like a new Silent Hill two vision or what have you.

841
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,380
Now, I know people have their opinions when it comes to that studio and the medium and so forth.

842
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:33,700
But I think those types of partnerships and putting the established IP in the hands of people that can actually do things with it, I think is the right way to go.

843
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,060
So I think in my opinion, that would be the best possible thing that comes out of this news.

844
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,300
So we'll see.

845
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,820
I yeah, and I'm with Darktitsvia in chat, I'll reserve judgment till I see what it is.

846
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,580
And big same, you know, I'm willing to give them the benefit of going into it with an open mind.

847
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,020
Tigerklonchat says it'll be a Silent Hill casino game.

848
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,220
If you get three pyramid heads, you win the jackpot.

849
00:50:54,340 --> 00:51:01,340
Yeah, obviously, there's casino and pachico jokes aplenty online with this and rightfully so Konami has earned every one of those jokes.

850
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:10,340
However, just yeah, this this is this is going to be something I would say worst case scenario is a mobile game.

851
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,660
But there's going to

852
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,180
that's or you're wrong.

853
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,900
They could get much worse than that.

854
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:22,420
I honestly truly don't think it will be I do think Konami with this hype and so forth.

855
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,300
This is not about pachinko or casino.

856
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,660
This is about a game.

857
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,180
It could be a mobile game.

858
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,860
But I, you know, again, whether smoke there's fire, right?

859
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,940
And we've heard the rumors of a reboot.

860
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:46,780
We've heard the rumors of, you know, going back and revisiting Silent Hill 2, especially when you consider Silent Hill 2 has been propped up into the year 2022 2021 through Dead by Daylight and other revivals of the IP.

861
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,580
Through merchandising and so forth.

862
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,140
Three and two.

863
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,820
Three and two.

864
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,700
Yes, you're right, of course.

865
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,180
Because, yeah, with with Cheryl.

866
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,260
Because of Heather Cheryl.

867
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:54,620
Yeah.

868
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:01,580
So but but my point still stands, you know, is that like Silent Hill is still kind of, you know, been bolstered up and so forth.

869
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,020
And so there's there's a reason to revisit those older games.

870
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,380
So let's let's see.

871
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,940
I do think there is going to be an actual game.

872
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,100
And we'll see.

873
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,180
I hope they put it in the right hands, you know.

874
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:26,660
Yeah, but but like the last Metal Gear game, the last Contra game that they've made, the Silent Hill remake that they did a remaster.

875
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,500
I know the remaster track record is not good.

876
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:37,260
And what's the the soccer games that they have that allegedly one of the rumors was that that team is working on this.

877
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,740
Yike, I just like there's like, that's true.

878
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,300
Forget it.

879
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,260
Forget it.

880
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,580
I can't imagine a good outcome.

881
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:48,060
Loki, the thing all those things have in common, they've all been developed internally.

882
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:52,420
And that's why I have reservations about the sweet code and HD remix, to be quite honest.

883
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,500
I would say that looks better than anything else so far.

884
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,380
So maybe some lessons have been learned.

885
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,100
I don't know.

886
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,780
Maybe they're not working off of broken code like the Silent Hill 3 one was.

887
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,980
But I'm sorry, my hesitations are completely justified.

888
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,420
So let's see.

889
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,220
Prove me wrong.

890
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,900
I, I would love nothing more than to be wrong.

891
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,700
Yeah, I would love to be wrong.

892
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,020
Please.

893
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:14,500
Love to be wrong.

894
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,540
Please let me be wrong.

895
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:16,340
Yeah.

896
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,940
TigerClawnChat says Konami saw how successful the TMNT Kawabunga collection was.

897
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,060
What if it was some type of Silent Hill collection?

898
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,140
They already tried that, remember?

899
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:33,260
And they couldn't because they didn't want to go into the voice actor agreements from two and three.

900
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,780
They redid with all new voice actors.

901
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,940
And it wasn't the voice acting alone.

902
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,220
But the two and three redos that when they did revisit that were terrible.

903
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:46,460
Well, the fact that they were missing the game code, the finished game code for three.

904
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,860
Yeah, so.

905
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:56,340
So they had to work off of an earlier build and we could it still had a lot of the glitches that had been fixed for the final release.

906
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:01,780
Yeah, I but but yeah, if that's where they're going to go is that somebody is going to rebuild Silent Hill from scratch.

907
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,380
Hell, all four of the original games.

908
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,940
Justice for the room.

909
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,140
I hope it was good.

910
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,740
I hope they go about it like the way that Resident Evil has been like.

911
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,860
Yeah, that's a good.

912
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,180
That's a great way to do that.

913
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,180
Let's do that with Silent Hill would be fantastic.

914
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,820
Yeah, I would be all about that.

915
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,580
Absolutely.

916
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,220
Absolutely.

917
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,940
All right.

918
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:28,580
Well, I brought up voice actors for a reason, because the actual kickoff story tonight that we had slotted before all this breaking news was something that has taken social media by storm.

919
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:34,140
I have a lot to say on this, but Loki is I'm going to let you cover the facts of this scenario.

920
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,740
And then I'm just a warning.

921
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,540
I have a lot to say, Loki.

922
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:56,100
So Helena Taylor had come out, I believe it was on Twitter and posted a few videos on Twitter talking about how she wasn't doing the voice for Bayonetta three, and that she wanted folks to boycott the game.

923
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:06,300
The reason for that is because the final offer that Platinum Games gave her for her performance for the whole game was $4,000.

924
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:13,500
Mind you, this is a company that's made hundreds of millions of dollars off of the franchise so far.

925
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:19,100
The going rate for voice acting anyways is about 1000.

926
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:33,420
I think David Hayter came out and said something about what was it like $1,000 per hour, you know, is kind of like the bare minimum like going rate for like the voice acting of that caliber or something like that.

927
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:39,700
So there's no way to be able to record the entire dialogue for a whole game in four hours or four sessions.

928
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:46,260
So it's basically it was a way to kind of force her out because they couldn't fire her.

929
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:55,180
So instead, they're offering her a salary that she's obviously not going to take in basically forcing her to quit.

930
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:04,620
And then of course, now they're getting Jennifer Hale to come in to do the voice acting and you can't tell me that she's cheaper than $4,000.

931
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:09,660
She's not. It's I don't know what the reasoning was with pushing her out.

932
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:25,020
But basically that it's kind of interesting to like with Jennifer Hale, because I think she also like was a big proponent of like the voice actors, like a union and everything and kind of pushing for that.

933
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:33,780
So like this kind of hear about what's going on and someone being pushed out and then someone else coming in to just, oh, do the role like that's a little weird.

934
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:37,620
Yeah, yeah.

935
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,140
So here's the thing.

936
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:49,180
There's a lot of talk on Twitter about this $4,000 and paying Helena what she's worth and you know, all of this.

937
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,900
And I do I do agree with a lot of that.

938
00:56:53,140 --> 00:57:03,820
You know, Helena, you know, as the voice actors, her Bayonetta deserves a sum of money that is representative of this character that she's been asked to come back and portray for the third time.

939
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,660
So that part I do agree with.

940
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:10,420
And so there's that you as I was watching the videos, here's the thing.

941
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:20,740
I think a lot of people talking about this on social media haven't bothered to watch the videos, her videos and hear the words out of her mouth directly because there was a lot in it that kind of surprised me.

942
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,860
And here's where I have an opinion that I think differs from the norm.

943
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,100
And I'm willing to stand by it.

944
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:39,580
I have been unfollowed on Twitter already because of this opinion, because people are so tied to these headlines that they believe in and I truly believe have lost the ability somewhere along the way to critically think.

945
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,300
But it is what it is.

946
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,940
I can't force engagement on any platform and best of luck to you.

947
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,740
And I hope things in your tunnel vision, la la land go wonderfully.

948
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:54,460
My viewpoint is that Helena Taylor is lying by omission in these videos, and I'm going to tell you why.

949
00:57:55,620 --> 00:58:02,340
In the first and second video, as I watch them, she's explaining the process that she went through.

950
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:06,860
She had to audition again for the role because it's been a few years.

951
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:10,460
You have to make sure the voice level is still there and so forth, which all makes sense.

952
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:20,780
She talks about appealing to Kamaya to get more money, and she was offered this insultingly low $4,000, which can't even pay for certain things and so forth.

953
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:25,620
And in those first two videos, I am completely like with her and I'm like, yeah, that's shitty.

954
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,380
What the fuck?

955
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:33,860
Like, yeah, she's earned certainly a much larger paycheck than, you know, if $4,000 is the base, she really deserves much more than that.

956
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:48,740
I mean, granted, I know that voice actors and actresses can supplement income quite greatly with the convention circuit and signing autographs and making appearances and doing all of that.

957
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,580
However, she shouldn't have to rely on that.

958
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,900
She should be able to get a decent paycheck.

959
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,700
Then the third video happens.

960
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:09,060
In the third video, she talks about her replacement, and she says, and about the new girl, hold on.

961
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:17,620
Surely she knows at this point because it is well documented that her replacement is Jennifer fucking Hale.

962
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:28,020
The new girl, that was a patronizing comment towards her replacement, who is a veteran and a respected person in this industry.

963
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:42,660
And that was the first thing that made me raise my eyebrow going, wait a minute, I thought the voice actor circle of actors and actresses was very tight knit, and that she, you know, they all know each other and they all get along and they all support each other and it's like a big family, right?

964
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:48,220
I also noticed that Helena Taylor hasn't done a lot of convention appearances.

965
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,260
She appeared at a convention in Phoenix.

966
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:55,100
I noticed other voice actors and actresses in Bayonetta have shown up, even some of them here locally.

967
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,260
That struck me as a curiosity.

968
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:00,460
That's all.

969
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:15,260
Then she goes on to say, in a very backhanded compliment, while I wish her the best of luck, she has no right to sign things as Bayonetta, or do things as the character that I've created.

970
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,620
Jennifer Hale doesn't need to sign things as Bayonetta.

971
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:27,420
Jennifer Hale has a resume that goes far beyond Bayonetta.

972
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:34,420
You, Helena Taylor, may need that supplemental income.

973
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,620
Jennifer Hale does not.

974
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:40,620
You're threatened by Jennifer Hale coming in and taking this role.

975
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,020
That's what I got from this video.

976
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:48,020
And then the proverbial cherry on top of the sundate is the fourth video.

977
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:53,420
She starts telling a tale from the Bible about Lazarus.

978
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:58,220
She's comparing her situation to a story out of the Bible.

979
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:06,220
But if you go in and you look at Helena Taylor's like tweets, it should be no surprise that she's quite religiously influenced.

980
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:10,820
She likes tweets from homophobic pastors like Joel Osteen in her history.

981
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,420
Here's the thing.

982
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:26,420
Again, I was with her on those first two videos, but when she started shading Jennifer Hale, and that's what that third video was, I said, no, there's more to this story than this.

983
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:35,420
And I'm going back to something Loki said here about the whole, you know, they purposely offered her a lowball figure to get her out the door.

984
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:46,420
And that's this, this, you know, again, I don't know why if they just wanted her out the door, why didn't they just flunk her audition, they could have done that.

985
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:52,420
There is talk out there and I don't, I don't know if this is true, this may be considered spoilery.

986
01:01:52,420 --> 01:02:00,420
There is talk out there that the Bayonetta character was supposed to be killed in the beginning of Bayonetta 3 and replaced with like an alternate Bayonetta.

987
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:13,420
So like this whole game was designed, so it is potential, if that ends up being the plot, that she was only offered so much money to do the role because Bayonetta as we know her is only in the game for a few minutes.

988
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:24,420
And if that's the case, does $4,000 seem like such an ugly sum, or is matching the sum you were paid for a prior game actually kind of a nice thing to do?

989
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,420
Now again, until we know the plot of the game, we don't know if any of that is true.

990
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:42,420
However, going back to the third video, Helena Taylor had no problem breaking her NDA, shading Jennifer Taylor, and casually saying, if there is a spinoff game that comes out with Jean, you shouldn't support it.

991
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,420
So just casually mentioning that there's a spinoff game.

992
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:55,420
Helena, why is Platinum Games trying to keep developing games without you? Is it possible you are difficult to work with?

993
01:02:55,420 --> 01:03:05,420
And again, I don't know Helena Taylor. Perhaps she's a nice person. I'm a little put off by some of the things she said in her fourth video and some of the tweets she likes, but you know what, I'm willing to have an open mind.

994
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:11,420
But is there the possibility that Helena Taylor is difficult to work with?

995
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:31,420
So why are we all rushing to her side without even considering there is another element to the story? Because the other thing, a person like that knows how to milk sympathy for what they want.

996
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:42,420
It's called being a Karen. And I'm sorry, especially in that fourth video, I saw some, I was getting BKE from Helena Taylor.

997
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:53,420
They're also, it's like you were saying a minute ago, there are other factors to consider and people are very bandwagon-y.

998
01:03:53,420 --> 01:04:02,420
They see people that they respect jumping to conclusions and they jump to the conclusions as well.

999
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:19,420
And it's just how people are. People are followers. And what we need to do is people need to stop learning. People need to stop being followers and start being thinkers.

1000
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,420
Yes. 100% this.

1001
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:35,420
Start looking, I'm going to use an analogy, okay? I've been on this 70s movie's kick and I just watched Logan's run again. I don't know if you know how that movie ends.

1002
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:49,420
Well, here's a 40-year spoiler. They're trapped in this world where everyone has to die at 30. And so these two people get out, they learn there's an outside world and that you can keep living and they come back.

1003
01:04:49,420 --> 01:05:02,420
And the thing that the computer system had them go out to learn, they keep refuting with real life thing and the computer breaks because the truth conflicts with its preconceived notions.

1004
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:14,420
And I think that that's how people get. That once they have latched onto an idea, they're going to keep rolling with it no matter how wrong they are and not look for anything outside of their echo chamber.

1005
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:19,420
They want to be right and they want to be angry.

1006
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:26,420
They unfollowed me from Twitter because they didn't like what I had to say about maybe Helena Taylor is not the angel she paints herself to be in this situation.

1007
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:32,420
I watched her videos and I was just disgusted within five seconds. I was like, I don't care. Jennifer Hill's a good voice actor.

1008
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:45,420
It's kind of also like, though, we have a ton of stories about like corporations in the gaming sector doing things that are unfair to their employees.

1009
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:52,420
So it is a very believable scenario that they may be trying to push her out because of some reasoning.

1010
01:05:52,420 --> 01:06:02,420
And that's why people don't necessarily look further into it because it's like, okay, yeah, this is like the fifth story this week that we've heard about companies screwing over their employees.

1011
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:06,420
It's just very believable at this point.

1012
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:10,420
And I want to make myself clear on something and I want to illustrate this with a comment from chat here.

1013
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,420
So Mike Defton in our chat says, I've said it on Twitter and on Discord.

1014
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:18,420
What we should take about this whole ordeal is voice actors get shafted a lot, fair treatment and pay to them.

1015
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:27,420
I want to make sure I stress this. In those first two videos, I was with her and I said, yes, voice actors don't get paid enough.

1016
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:31,420
Yes, the voice of Bayonetta should be paid more money for the success of the game.

1017
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,420
Yes, yes, all of those things can be true.

1018
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:44,420
Voice actors need to be respected, especially now that we're getting into this realm of like live capture and so forth and all the stuff I talked about, you know, after the Red Dead Redemption panel that I did to Dragon Con and so forth.

1019
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:47,420
Yes, we need to make sure we're paying actors their fair work.

1020
01:06:47,420 --> 01:07:04,420
However, Helena Taylor lost me when she started shading Jennifer fucking Hale, who, by the way, Internet, before you, if you have called Jennifer Hale a scab in this whole thing, I need you to stop and look at your life and look at your choices and ask yourself if you know how to critically think.

1021
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,420
Look at her record.

1022
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:07,420
Look at her fucking record.

1023
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:14,420
Jennifer Hale in 2016 was fighting for voice actor unionization rights.

1024
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:20,420
I can't believe the fucking nerve of some of you people on Twitter, the way you're going after Jennifer Hale.

1025
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:24,420
Do you think she fucking knew about any of this?

1026
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:27,420
God, it's disgusting.

1027
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:35,420
And here's the thing, I think that's the one person we would all love to hear from in this scenario is Jennifer Hale.

1028
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:43,420
However, guess what? She doesn't need half or want to say a goddamn thing.

1029
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:47,420
And every single one of us, including myself, needs to live with that.

1030
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:52,420
Jennifer Hale does not owe a comment on this entire issue.

1031
01:07:52,420 --> 01:08:00,420
However, that all being said, Jennifer Hale is saying things in her own way.

1032
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,420
She's liking some tweets.

1033
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:10,420
She can't say things because of her NDA, but she can like some things, such as a tweet that read,

1034
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:14,420
Helena understandably declined and then later Jennifer Hale was cast in the role.

1035
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:18,420
I don't know how much Jennifer was paid, but I imagine it was likely more than what Helena was offered.

1036
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:21,420
Why? That's up to platinum to answer, not Jennifer.

1037
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,420
I agree with that.

1038
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,420
Jennifer Hale definitely hasn't done anything wrong here.

1039
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:29,420
After looking into the situation, it sounds like Helena was offered around the base SAG-AFTRA rate per session,

1040
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:33,420
which is still insulting and a low ball for a returning main character in a game this popular.

1041
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:38,420
Jennifer liked that tweet even after Helena shaded her, which I thought was a very nice thing to do.

1042
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:45,420
Another tweet that Jennifer liked. I agree with this.

1043
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:52,420
I loved Bayonetta's voice in the first two games, but boycotting is not the way to go since it disrespects Jennifer when she had nothing to do with this.

1044
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:57,420
I definitely want voice actors to be paid better, but there are other ways to handle this. Yes.

1045
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:01,420
And then look at this tweet that Jennifer liked. This is the one I really want to highlight.

1046
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:06,420
I don't doubt this for one second, talking about Jennifer is a staunch advocate of VA rights.

1047
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:14,420
The first part of Helena's tweets made perfect sense and I agree, but I think she was very unprofessional when talking about Jennifer.

1048
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:18,420
What happened to her isn't Jennifer's fault.

1049
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:25,420
And I think her like on that tweet says a lot of what I just said.

1050
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:34,420
So all I'm going to say is it's very tempting to run with a headline sometimes.

1051
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:39,420
And I've been guilty of this too. And this is a good reminder for me.

1052
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:44,420
But this is why I stopped and said, you know what? These videos, they're only like five minutes. Let me watch.

1053
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,420
I want to hear what she has to say about it.

1054
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:52,420
There was that moment in that third video where I went, this doesn't add up.

1055
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,420
Something's off.

1056
01:09:54,420 --> 01:10:06,420
The shade is unnecessary, spilling and breaking the NDA so fragrantly, basically daring platinum games to come after her is unnecessary.

1057
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:12,420
Questbuster in our chat room says there's also the cultural context of platinum as a Japanese company.

1058
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:18,420
They may have felt the offer allowed both to save face a big deal in countries like Japan, especially in business.

1059
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:23,420
Perhaps they were obligated to offer her the role, but ultimately didn't want to or want her.

1060
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,420
Yeah.

1061
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,420
So.

1062
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:29,420
Anyway, that that that makes perfect sense.

1063
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:32,420
I mean, that is pretty standard.

1064
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:38,420
I mean, not just in dealing with a role or something, but in dealing with people.

1065
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:42,420
And that's when someone is expected to decline.

1066
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,420
And that's to circle back. That's what I want to say.

1067
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:49,420
When I said at the beginning, I believe Helena Taylor is lying by omission.

1068
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:58,420
The part that she is admitting, either because she truly doesn't know it or I think she does, but she's leaving this part out is she's difficult to work with.

1069
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:09,420
And I think, again, that fourth video and I think I think there's there in the way she shaded somebody in an industry that should be close.

1070
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,420
I think there's a lot to say there.

1071
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:14,420
I.

1072
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,420
I have heard.

1073
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:22,420
There have been some disappearing tweets from people, and I'm not talking about Kamiya.

1074
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,420
I understand Kamiya on Twitter as a whole.

1075
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,420
Look, I'm just I'm not going to go there.

1076
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:30,420
I already said Platinum Games is not without their own issues in this whole thing.

1077
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:38,420
I'm not forgiving them. I'm not saying they were in the right, but I am saying maybe there's something to this whole thing.

1078
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:45,420
However, I have heard of some other deleted tweets from people who may be in the know.

1079
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:48,420
There's more to this story that we don't know yet.

1080
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:53,420
What what what are some of those tweets? Because I went to bed.

1081
01:11:54,420 --> 01:12:09,420
Basically, that just pouring a little gasoline on the fire of she's leaving stuff out, that there's there's more to the story that than she's leading on, that she's she knows what she's doing to stroke the sympathy lights and all this stuff.

1082
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,420
This is this is a calculated move on her part.

1083
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:18,420
Yeah, I think she's I think she's threatened by her appearances on the convention circuit.

1084
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:22,420
I think that's what this all boils down to. I think she's threatened because she's not getting the convention bookings.

1085
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:27,420
Jennifer Hale does. I think her I think I think that someone's jelly.

1086
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:31,420
Yeah, I do. So we'll see. We'll see.

1087
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:37,420
But I again, I you know, again, it's one of those things where it's like, if I'm an asshole, when we find this whole thing is said and done, then fine.

1088
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:42,420
But I don't I again, I think the proof is in the way Helena said these things.

1089
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,420
And I think what you see Jennifer Hale liking on Twitter.

1090
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,420
He has a lot of insight as well.

1091
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,420
So.

1092
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:51,420
All right.

1093
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,420
Let's see.

1094
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,420
Other comments in chat.

1095
01:12:56,420 --> 01:13:00,420
DJ Ramesh does point out Helena is also UK based, so she won't get a lot of bookings here.

1096
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,420
That is that is true. It's harder to bring somebody out from over there.

1097
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:10,420
Let's see. A Zen Monkey 11 says difficult to work with. Don't you mean get paid less?

1098
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,420
There is an interesting trend.

1099
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,420
I'm sure you've heard of quiet quitting.

1100
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:18,420
Look up a trend called quiet firing.

1101
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:23,420
Because I think some of that is what you're talking about here.

1102
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:25,420
So.

1103
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:32,420
Bonds 006 says I view almost everything I see online regarding social media with calculated intent. Sure.

1104
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:40,420
But is it why? Why couldn't she have done videos that said, hey, here's the reason I'm not coming back as Bayonetta.

1105
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,420
I was only offered 4000 to play the role.

1106
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:46,420
I feel after the first two games made this amount of money, I was entitled to more money.

1107
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:52,420
And this is the you know, this is you know what this this wage 4000 is minimum wage.

1108
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:58,420
And I felt what I brought to the character Bayonetta was minimum wage and ended it there.

1109
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:02,420
I think she would have had she would have had my support.

1110
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:07,420
But she didn't end it there. That's the problem.

1111
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:13,420
All right. Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

1112
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:17,420
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

1113
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:26,420
A little eventful. I played, of course, Dead by Daylight, but I played offline because I couldn't stream with no voice.

1114
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:32,420
I started Final Fantasy five last night again on a quiet stream this time.

1115
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:41,420
And I had forgotten quite a bit about it. And I'm kind of glad for it because it makes the experience new and fresh for me again.

1116
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:54,420
I played some pinball and I played like this phone runner cookie game at TwitchCon.

1117
01:14:54,420 --> 01:15:01,420
But I also played Street Fighter six and fuck it's good.

1118
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:06,420
I mean, I'll admit I'm not great at it.

1119
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:14,420
I actually played the controller, not the controller, but with the joystick one LC and I played.

1120
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:19,420
And well, it kicked my butt because I was trying to figure out moves.

1121
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:25,420
But my verdict is that Kimberly is a great addition to the roster.

1122
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:30,420
She's sort of like what what Sakura is to Ryu.

1123
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:40,420
Kimberly is to Gai, like the successor to the Bushin Ryu style.

1124
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:46,420
And so she plays a lot like Gai, but with like this flair and this fun to it.

1125
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:54,420
And and like she's got this extra color palette that's all like spray paint. Really, really good.

1126
01:15:54,420 --> 01:16:02,420
I played Chin Lee. She's Chin Lee. Boring. She's always fucking boring.

1127
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:10,420
I played I played Ryu, which I mean, again, Ryu. But he was my first video game crush.

1128
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:16,420
Ryu is my man. And oh, my God. Like, I think I put a picture up on my Twitter not long ago.

1129
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:23,420
I'll have to find it. You can see the pores in his skin like it's that well done.

1130
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:32,420
Of course, none of the women have pores. How dare we have pores. But but he's just rendered so beautiful.

1131
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:43,420
I mean, the game is gorgeous. The control scheme, getting used to that new counter system.

1132
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:46,420
It's all right. It wasn't really that bad with a dedicated button.

1133
01:16:47,420 --> 01:17:02,420
It's absolutely a game that you should have a at least a six button controller for or even an eight button so that you can map your your charging buttons and your your counters.

1134
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:10,420
Learning the counters was kind of interesting. But overall, I mean, it's it's such a good game.

1135
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:17,420
Oh, my God. I haven't been this excited about a Street Fighter game since Street Fighter four.

1136
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:22,420
And and yeah, I know that that my girl's going to be in DLC probably at some point.

1137
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:29,420
So another way to phrase that is you were not a fan of Street Fighter five because you just said it was your four and then six.

1138
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:35,420
So just just just say it. Five five was not your D. Even numbers, y'all.

1139
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:40,420
Those are good. But because honestly, I wasn't the biggest fan of Street Fighter three.

1140
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:44,420
I seem to like like all the the even numbered ones in the Street Fighter series.

1141
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:49,420
It's very Star Trek movies and still super pissed that.

1142
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:58,420
Well. That was something of that they took the Street Fighter four soundtrack off of Apple Music.

1143
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:02,420
Very sad about that. Very bitter. Had one of the best soundtracks.

1144
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:09,420
What else did I play, though? I played my word game.

1145
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:17,420
And I did because because we weren't here last week, I did beat Final Fantasy four.

1146
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:23,420
But but yeah, that's about. Oh, and I played.

1147
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:32,420
I played something else. Oh, I played some Bejeweled, believe it or not.

1148
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:36,420
I actually had a lot of fun. It's been a while since I played it.

1149
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:49,420
And you know me and my little puzzle droppy games. So also also I I've been spending a little bit more time with Boosteroid

1150
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:54,420
and there's a chance I may be picking up Fortnite. Oh, wow.

1151
01:18:54,420 --> 01:19:00,420
Yeah, because it's not first person. I mean, I absolutely cannot run Overwatch two.

1152
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:06,420
There's just no way I can do it. No way. I because it's not on any of the emulator,

1153
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:11,420
you know, Windows things that won't run on Parallels on an M1 Mac.

1154
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:20,420
And I really was looking kind of looking forward to playing it now that things have shifted a bit with company.

1155
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:27,420
But yeah, there's also a vague chance I might be going back to Star Trek online. Oh, how random.

1156
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:35,420
But that's fun. I kind of miss it. And I miss playing with because I was in a fleet with a bunch of Scotsman.

1157
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:39,420
How cute. Because I was playing like at the weird times the morning.

1158
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:45,420
Well, one of them is an English guy that lives in Edinburgh is an architect, decent friend.

1159
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:51,420
And and I'd gotten in with with their fleet and we just kept playing.

1160
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:57,420
I kind of miss it. But mostly what I miss is just being bored and hanging out on DS9.

1161
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:05,420
So there's stuff going on in there. And oh, yeah, Cult of the Lamb, of course.

1162
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:13,420
Which I've just been I'm getting ready to beat the game will not beat the game, but do the thing.

1163
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:17,420
I do the thing. All right.

1164
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:21,420
Loki, let's go to your hearing week.

1165
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:28,420
Well, I mean, Minecraft. So I did want to talk about a little bit about what was in Minecraft Live.

1166
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:32,420
So this was interesting this year.

1167
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:41,420
Normally, the way it goes is they will announce the next update, kind of show off what the theme is and what they're doing and that type of stuff.

1168
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:49,420
The problem is that in the last few years, they've fallen behind and really.

1169
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:55,420
If I guess that not over promised, but they didn't deliver on what their promises were.

1170
01:20:55,420 --> 01:21:03,420
So, for example, going back to 117 Caves and Cliffs, they had to split that up in the two parts.

1171
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:09,420
And I'm sure a lot of it has to do with COVID, obviously, and that delayed everything.

1172
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:18,420
Plus the retooling of how chunks generate and adding that world height and the world depth to it.

1173
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:22,420
It complicated things and redoing how all the caves and stuff were.

1174
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,420
So it took them two updates to get that out.

1175
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:37,420
And then the last update, which was 119, the wild update, they had promised like, oh, yeah, we're going to go back to all these biomes and kind of breathe new life into them and make them all feel diverse and do all this stuff.

1176
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:41,420
And they showed the mangrove swamps, which get added to the game.

1177
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:48,420
They showed off the deep dark, which was supposed to have been in caves and cliffs two updates ago.

1178
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:57,420
And then they showed off concept art for these birch forests that they're supposed to update, but they did never get around to that.

1179
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:12,420
So instead of delivering on their promises, they swung the pendulum the completely opposite direction and didn't reveal much of anything in this one.

1180
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,420
They don't have a name for the update.

1181
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:26,420
They didn't really see what their theme is for it, except some vague stuff on Twitter about inclusiveness and representation and and storytelling, which.

1182
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:32,420
Like that could be just anything like it really that's not a direction.

1183
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,420
We're getting camels, which is cool, I guess.

1184
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:36,420
OK, cool.

1185
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:48,420
Hanging signs, bamboo wood now has a new block type and bookshelves you can put books inside of.

1186
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:55,420
That's kind of it, like it's all this random stuff that doesn't really fit together.

1187
01:22:55,420 --> 01:23:04,420
It's cool, some of it, but in the mob vote, we got this new mob called the Sniffer, which is like this prehistoric turtle dog looking thing.

1188
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:07,420
It's kind of weird, but they did that.

1189
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:13,420
But like, we don't know what they're bringing to the game, which is kind of frustrating.

1190
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,420
And it's frustrating a lot of the community as well.

1191
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:18,420
I understand like they don't want to disappoint people.

1192
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:25,420
And it's cool that all this stuff that they are talking about arguing snapshots that are probably coming out in the next week or two.

1193
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:30,420
But it would be nice to see, like, here's what we're trying to do.

1194
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,420
Like, here's the theme that we have in mind.

1195
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:35,420
But here's the stuff that we have done from this right now.

1196
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,420
They're just not showing a lot.

1197
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,420
So it's hard to get excited about things.

1198
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:40,420
So that was just the main line stuff.

1199
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:45,420
They showed off more Minecraft Legends footage, which I'm still kind of mixed on.

1200
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:48,420
It looks all right, but like, I'm not like super excited to play that.

1201
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:51,420
Not really much for dungeons either.

1202
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:54,420
And then what else?

1203
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:59,420
They had some weird thing about Minecraft Lego, but didn't really like show any new sets or anything.

1204
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:02,420
It was just completely random nonsense that was in there.

1205
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:04,420
It's just weird.

1206
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:05,420
Just it felt weird.

1207
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:11,420
But most of the week, aside from just the Minecraft stuff, it's been working on my episode.

1208
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:19,420
So I got that out earlier this week, which it'd been I'm trying to get back to doing one a week type of thing.

1209
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,420
We'll see.

1210
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:22,420
But I'm trying to get back to that again.

1211
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,420
All right.

1212
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,420
Let's see my gaming week.

1213
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:31,420
So I've played a little bit of a jumble of games, the usual stuff and playing Final Fantasy 14, of course.

1214
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:36,420
Dead by Daylight has that cute little Halloween event in it, which is, you know, it's cute.

1215
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:39,420
I'm hearing a lot of rumors about the new killer and survivor.

1216
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:44,420
So I'm hoping we get to see those before too long because I'm super curious to see what they're going to add with that.

1217
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:52,420
But then going back and revisiting old favorites, I got back on my No Man's Sky bullshit because the 4.0 update happened.

1218
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,420
But I didn't even I never came out of nowhere.

1219
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:58,420
A Twitch drops campaign started on Friday and I was like, what?

1220
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:05,420
So I ended up doing a stream on Friday to help people get their drops for the game, especially with it coming out on Nintendo Switch.

1221
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:12,420
Unfortunately, with the show yesterday that was taking up most of my day and then, of course, tonight's OLR, I haven't been able to stream this weekend.

1222
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:17,420
But I'll do one more stream tomorrow on the last day of drops on Monday because there's some really good ones for Monday.

1223
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:24,420
So I'll do a stream then and been exploring the and I keep joking and calling it the Bobby Black Wolf mode.

1224
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:36,420
If you don't know the long running VoG network in joke, there was some problems and some controversy when the game Borderlands 2 came out because they had a character that had a BFF mode in it.

1225
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:52,420
And it was long story short, it was interpreted as a long standing motif that female characters and women need help in video games, which as we all know, is not true because

1226
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:56,420
women make up more than half the game press.

1227
01:25:56,420 --> 01:26:08,420
But when Bobby Black Wolf actually interviewed the developers on his show, he kind of asked the question about that whole thing and asked for their side of it and so forth.

1228
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:12,420
And he said that they could rename BB mode or whatever it was to Bobby Black Wolf mode.

1229
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:16,420
So now we call the easy mode in games Bobby Black Wolf mode because he plays games on easy mode.

1230
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:19,420
So No Man's Sky added a Bobby Black Wolf mode to it.

1231
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:28,420
We should not shame anybody. You know why we shouldn't be like, let's be honest, like I get home at the end of the day, and I may not necessarily want to be challenged in the game.

1232
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:37,420
I just want to have fun. You know what, and that's and that's why they have difficulties because if your fun is you want to be challenged in something, you can choose to do that or you can choose not to do that.

1233
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:41,420
It's however you want it, however you have your fun.

1234
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:54,420
Yeah, that was it. Thank you, fifth dream. It was something like it was girlfriend mode was in one of the comments that was said not that set up the whole that was that was some years old controversy. Sorry, I'm a little rusty, but that's where the Bobby Black Wolf mode comment came from.

1235
01:26:54,420 --> 01:27:06,420
So anyway, I actually played the game a little bit on stream in in relaxed mode is what it's really called. And I actually I was really enjoying myself because yeah, sometimes you just want to play easy mode.

1236
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:20,420
And it was actually really nice to have the base where it's like you don't have to make power for your base, you just automatically have power in your base. I don't have to worry about getting attacked by pirates. You know that it's different from creative mode because you're still going through the motions of actually playing the game.

1237
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:34,420
But you don't like have to micromanage as much or and so to kind of take that out of it is actually it leads to some kind of fun things. I would still play the game on even hardcore once in a while just for the difficulty to do achievements and things like that.

1238
01:27:34,420 --> 01:28:02,420
But the game didn't lose anything for introducing relaxed mode. And I really think it's smart for them to have introduced custom mode, where you make your own fucking rules. If you want to do the survivability on planets, but eliminate pirates and space battles, you can do it that way. You can play this part of its relax this part of its normal, but I want permadeath. You can do that. And what I like about it is that all of those modes except for permadeath are mixed together.

1239
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:31,420
So if you play permadeath, you're going to be in your own instance of the game when it comes to multiplayer. But otherwise, all the modes are mixed together. So you can play with your friends the way you want to play. And I think that's pretty rad. So kudos, I No Man's Sky is just the game that keeps on giving. It's great. I haven't played the switch version myself. It's $60. I don't know about charging that for a game that's been out for a while. But okay, like it is, it's hard to say the value isn't there after all the support over the years. So y'all make your own choices when it comes to how important is you to get that game.

1240
01:28:32,420 --> 01:29:01,420
portable and all that stuff. But um, yeah, I Yeah, if you haven't checked out No Man's Sky yet, make it a point to do so it's great. I played a little bit of speaking of like new stuff, new stuff. I played a little bit of Overwatch two, there was some launch hiccups and so forth. But I played a little bit with Alan, we played some and it's um, you know, it's it's similar to Overwatch one in a lot of ways, obviously, except they change the team comps, which kind of changed the nitty gritty of the game. And you know, the kind of the flow of the game.

1241
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:32,380
of how fast people are dying, how it's more important than ever to really group up, you know, things of that. But for the most part, as far as there's that, like that experience of, you know, quick team combat. Yeah, I had a good time. You know, I like these games right now. I like these dead by daylights, these over watches. I'm kind of surprised I haven't gotten back into fortnight yet, but Alan just got super into it. So I'm probably do. But the thing I'm liking about these games right now. The palette resets every 20 minutes, because a new game start every everything starts over. And it's a new game.

1242
01:29:32,420 --> 01:30:00,260
game again. And that's kind of what I like about streaming, especially these games and watching streams of these games, because it's easy to just hop right in again. Right. So I think that part's pretty cool. Anyway, that's a little bit about my gaming week. So we have some more news to get into. So we're gonna kick it off with Loki getting into the news this week. Because, again, I know we just talked about like five things at the top of the show. But here's the actual like what happened during the week and not all like three hours before the show.

1243
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:27,260
So this is going back to a story that we talked about a few weeks ago, about a contract worker that was terminated, allegedly, wrongfully, because they had questioned or asked about unions, I guess. So apparently, there has been a settlement that was reached with this individual for the amount of $25,910 with interest. And it's been a long time since we've had a contract worker that was terminated, allegedly, wrongfully, because they had questioned or asked about unions, I guess.

1244
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:50,260
And it's supposed to be paid to through Aston Carter, which is the hiring agency that Nintendo uses. But of course, it has to be, I think, agreed upon with there's one other group that had to make the agreement with that. But it sounds like that this is going to be concluding with that settlement.

1245
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:59,260
So I guess they're not good. Maybe there's smoke where there is fire there since, you know, maybe they had a case. That's why they're paying them out.

1246
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:23,260
So it's very clear that, you know, Nintendo's got problems of their own. And that's not even the things we were talking about earlier in the show. Like this is just like, when it comes to their employees, they unfortunately, and it goes back to what we said from the very beginning when it started with Activision Blizzard, this is an industry wide problem. And there's a lot of people in the industry that need to be held accountable.

1247
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:41,260
So now, granted, what's happening with Nintendo, there's there are some differences here, but with the union busting and so forth, like, that's not cool. Obviously, we know that. And so it's nice to see that, you know, the, the the laws on the workers side in this case. So, you know, you can be a fan of Nintendo and still say what they're doing here. Not cool. Not cool.

1248
01:31:41,260 --> 01:32:09,260
All right, before we get into our next story, I have some more breaking news. And it ties to something we were just talking about. Dark Sakura, did you know this? You just wrote a tweet. I support Jennifer Hale. She is an advocate of voice actor rights and Helena was ridiculously unprofessional in her videos, and she broke NDA. Jennifer is innocent in this. Look at facts and learn to think critically. Five likes.

1249
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:32,260
Really? One of them, Jennifer Hale. Oh, shit. In the last 20 minutes. I didn't look. Oh, that's nice. I love her. Hmm. She's such a sweetie. Hmm. And that makes me happy. Hmm. Moving on. Yeah. Hey, I'm part of the drama now.

1250
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:47,260
No, you don't want to be Twitter's main character tomorrow. But, um, no, but I'm, I'm doing a screenshot. Huh? And I've met her. She's so nice. She likes my Grey Warden costume.

1251
01:32:47,260 --> 01:33:11,260
She's obviously bound by an NDA. And she can't say things, but she can still say a lot. And I'm telling them just again, like, we all have been watching this industry for a very long time. And there's just sometimes there's a certain way the tea leaves flow together. Anyway. All right, moving on. Let's talk about Street Five as if we can.

1252
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:35,260
Move on. Let's talk about Street Fighter six. I just I just moved the darn title of the stream clicking around too much. All right. No. Street Fighter six has some pretty cool accessibility features that are built into it. And this is, you know, one of those things where it's like, oh, cool, you know, Street Fighter five didn't necessarily bring all this, but it really seems like Street Fighter six is bringing a lot to this, too.

1253
01:33:35,260 --> 01:34:00,260
the table. They're bringing up some sound accessibility to help visually impaired players. By the way, this is all coming out of the beta because the beta recently happened for the game or might still be going on. I'm not sure I wasn't in it. But I know a lot of this information is because of the beta that's underway right now. But you can actually get spoken signals in the game for the menu system and select screens, and then customizable sound options during the fight. So you can actually get spoken signals in the game.

1254
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:30,220
the menu system and select screens, and then customizable sound options during the fight. So you can actually get sound for like distance, whether a strike actually connected or was blocked, drive gauge when it gains up or it burns when a player does a jump attack alternate sounds if you cross the opponent. So that's pretty cool. You can also use a slider system to adjust the volume of every element of the fight. So maybe you don't want the music to be so loud or things like that. Yeah, that's all that's all things that you can change. So

1255
01:34:30,220 --> 01:35:00,140
that's really cool for accessibility and having some more of those visual cues have sound effects. So also, what's kind of cool, Street Fighter six is going to have customizable, a new challenger screen. So that's kind of cute. You know, when you put in remember back in Street Fighter two, you put in a new quarter and you hit the start button and it says says do do do do do do here comes a new challenger. Well, now you can actually customize these screens, you could have a different character in it. You can combine effects and

1256
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:29,860
colors to kind of, you know, bring a little excitement to the online matches as you drop in and so forth. So I imagine a lot of these cosmetics are going to be things that you earn through in game credits. Maybe things you purchase. I don't know, we don't know yet. So I can't I can't really say that. But there is that. And of course, there is character creator mode in Street Fighter six. So finally, one of my favorite parts of Soul Calibur comes to Street Fighter six. There is that and of course, there are some very zany fighters that are showing up as a

1257
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:48,580
result of that. So yeah, you can you can have different thickness and characters, hand size, abdomen bulge, different colors for everything. Muscle definition gets a three way slider. So you all know people are going wild in Street Fighter six.

1258
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:50,300
I've seen some freakish things.

1259
01:35:50,420 --> 01:36:19,460
Yeah, so imagination. A lot of you have it out there in the gaming community. So yeah, so um, but I'm, I'm really excited to play Street Fighter six, that's for sure. So one of these days, I'll get around to it when the actual game comes out. Huh? All right. Moving on. Let's go to the next story. Look, sorry, I just I'm still reeling from that literal late breaking news about what we were just talking about and how it's it's like playing out in real time. Very interesting, isn't it? All right.

1260
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,100
Moving on Loki.

1261
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:51,060
So meta has revealed its brand new VR headset, the meta quest Pro, it's $1,500. And it's best, I guess, I'm trying to see what the the extra details are with it. I know that they're not necessarily targeting gamers for this, but more of they're looking at using this as a full on metaverse work tool, like almost like a PC that you would

1262
01:36:51,060 --> 01:37:11,380
work with. It's still too expensive. Um, but yeah, I think it has like the better tracking and of course, a more powerful processor in it or whatever. But I ain't paying $1,500 for a VR headset. I don't see how they're gonna sell this.

1263
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:38,500
That is way too much money for a medium that hasn't broken through in the mainstream and quite the way it needs to to justify this kind of cost. I have it's growing has eye tracking expression tracking as well, which I guess will be used for more they said more expressive avatars. Maybe funded rent rendering or whatever with the eye tracking as well. But this I think it's too too expensive.

1264
01:37:38,500 --> 01:38:07,940
This is the Mercedes Benz of VR devices. And Bobby Blackwell points out they want to sell to businesses not casuals and businesses will pay. And I I understand I understand but I still think I'm not sure. You know, and even in my day work, I've seen like VR and how they want to integrate VR into that. And I understand like, let's say, let's say you want to teach somebody industrial like things and using a new factory thing in the factory.

1265
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:36,780
But it's, you know, it's something you can't really learn in a book, but at the same time, it's dangerous equipment. And it's really hard to show somebody in real life. Like VR can kind of be a bridge to help teach somebody about those sorts of things. So I get that like a $1,500 device is definitely aimed at the business in that capacity. However, it's something that you said, Loki is something I'm not sure Bobby heard this about this story either. There's some story floating around there about meta.

1266
01:38:37,780 --> 01:39:06,740
That there was a business meeting about this type of device, and how how do we market this device to people, you know, and get people to pay it. And there was discussion about, well, people are getting their student loans forgiven. So now they'll have that extra money. And we need to market this device towards people that are getting student loans forgiven. And I'm like, now, granted, there's a lot of big grain of salt to take with that sort of story. Yeah. But at the same time, I kind of look at a company like meta and can I

1267
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:16,340
go? Can I see Zuckerberg saying something ridiculous like that? Can I see rich people completely out of touch with the rest of the world? Yes.

1268
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:45,340
If you're hell bent on like, if you think that, like, you need to spend 1500 for gaming and VR, I implore you to probably consider the PlayStation VR two and the PlayStation five if you want to go that route, and you probably still would have like $500 to spare on top of that. And you're probably gonna get a better experience altogether. Because like I'm telling you right now, if you spend $1,500 on that to go into the metaverse, which no one is using, by the way,

1269
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:49,340
or at least a horizon worlds thing. I

1270
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,020
that it's Yeah,

1271
01:39:51,620 --> 01:40:05,340
you horizon worlds and that whole I'm sorry, you're talking about the horizon zero dawn spin off on PlayStation, right? No, no, no, no, the horizon worlds as in the VR, like 3d chat. I don't even think that is that meta has

1272
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:09,180
Oh, that's what that's called. I thought that was just called metaverse that

1273
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:21,420
whole No, no, no meta metaverse is a thing that's like calling the internet like it. They want to go well metaverse that's us because we named ourselves meta and it's still so clever. It's stupid. But like,

1274
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:51,140
just I'm sorry, I get what you're saying. Like PlayStation and like the horizon zero dawn spin off in VR looks 25 2000 times more interesting than fucking fake Zuckerberg talking to fake people in their little fake world chat service that whatever they're calling it horizon metaverse it just looks it looks like 90s chat avatar fuck it looks like that Commodore 64 chat thing that people were doing on the 300 baud modems 30 years ago, there's

1275
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:57,260
nothing revolutionary about it. And it looks like a waste of time and money and resources to be quite honest.

1276
01:40:57,540 --> 01:41:20,820
There's gosh, I don't even remember the games called now but there's a free game that you can play on VR that has like a bunch of these little mini games in there. It's like I want to say it's a game room or something but it's not game room because that's that's PlayStation thing but there's something like that. It's like a VR game room. That looks better than this and that's that's you

1277
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:40,060
know, a free thing and you can play that with just any old headset like honestly like I wouldn't spend more than a few hundred dollars on a headset because especially like let's just say you want to go all out and spend that kind of money it's going to be outdated in a few years like you've just dumped that money and they're like well it's like a PC

1278
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:42,700
chat is pinch hitting with rec room by the way Logie

1279
01:41:42,780 --> 01:42:00,140
rec room Yes, thank you. That's what I see. So it just looks awful. Like it's in this is meta like I don't trust them at all. Like honestly wouldn't trust them. Look at it look at a valve index maybe or something like that. Save yourself some money.

1280
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:30,100
bonds 006 and chat says do we get a Rob's rant? No, I don't think so. Because I've made my distaste of Facebook getting into this space in the first place and gaming in general and so forth. And, you know, I understand why they bought Oculus I don't think, you know, I you know, whatever I have no, there's no rant for me. And I you know, Bobby does make a good point that like professionally, there might be something here. I still think meta is trying to target it beyond that based on you know, those other things.

1281
01:42:30,340 --> 01:43:00,060
But it's not like I have a rant in general about VR. I will absolutely pick up the PlayStation VR two on the PlayStation five when it comes out because that's going to have the stuff I'm I want to play. Because I'll tell you fake Zuckerberg and chatting with him in that space looks like a waste of my fucking time. And that's the rant you'll get is that they just like again, a game is only as good as our system is always good as the games that are on it and all that all that stuff, right? This, there's nothing here for me, but maybe that's okay that there's

1282
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:03,420
nothing here for me. But good luck to meta making money.

1283
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:13,260
And they're pushing that like the Microsoft Office Suite is coming to to this device like, okay, well, aside from like having like virtual

1284
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:14,740
get better for free.

1285
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:44,020
Like, why would you spend 1500 dollars to just do office in VR? Like, I can't imagine how that's gonna increase productivity at all. It's not it's gonna be in plus you're wearing the hat, you're gonna wear the headset for eight hours in a day. Well, one, the battery is not gonna support it. Number one. And number two, that would give you such a migraine. And it would be super inefficient. Like, I just don't see the point of it.

1286
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:48,180
Cyberpathy is not a thing yet. It won't do any good.

1287
01:43:49,300 --> 01:44:03,300
It's just like, just don't spend the money. Like, if you're a business looking to get into VR for like, you know, like these training things that like Rob was talking about, like, you can do it for cheaper. Like you could so do it for cheaper and not use meta.

1288
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:33,220
Yeah. All right. Anyhow, good thoughts and prayers to meta. All right, moving on. Let's talk about something. This actually came up in the last week, we were out last week, remember, because we were talking about TwitchCon. But we had, you know, the new Mario trailer came out. And I think there are some things we still want to say about it, even though it's last week's news. And I think the reactions and so forth are continuing into this week. So let me ask

1289
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:36,820
the panel and all of you in chat. What do you think?

1290
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:44,420
I think it looks great. Like people have a problem with Chris Pratt's voice in it because it sounds

1291
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:49,300
like Chris Pratt. I loved him in like the Lego movie and the other stuff that he's done.

1292
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:55,620
And like you're judging his performance based on literally seconds of audio.

1293
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:58,420
I just don't like Chris Pratt.

1294
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:03,220
That's fine. You don't have to like Chris Pratt, but like, I don't think it's going to be

1295
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:07,220
like horrible. I don't think it's going to completely ruin the movie.

1296
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:12,580
They're trying to like it seems like people are trying to get and I get it. They want Charles

1297
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:18,340
Martinet to do the voice for Mario. And maybe there's a reason why they're not doing that,

1298
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:22,980
because he's in the movie is playing the other characters. And it's probably because Mario's

1299
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:26,660
dad, I'm telling you, that's the cameo he's going to end up as Mario's dad.

1300
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:34,660
I mean, it's. I don't know, but like, I don't find like Chris Pratt super annoying in this.

1301
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:41,940
I think that like Jack Black is Bowser is friggin awesome. Like it just he stole the trailer,

1302
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:46,660
like just absolutely stand out. I think it looks good. I think it looks good. I'm excited to see

1303
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:53,060
it. Like I said, we let's just like at least see some more footage of this other than judging it

1304
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:58,820
by just his interpretation of it. Like, I get it. It's going to be different. Like,

1305
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:04,100
but just give it a chance. Like what what people are trying to do is they're like, see,

1306
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:08,340
we did this with Sonic. We're going to fix the game. We're going to fix the movie. We're going

1307
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:12,020
to complain and complain until they change the voice and make it Charles Martinet.

1308
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:20,100
I just don't think it needs it. I love Charles Martinet. I think he's fantastic. I think two

1309
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:26,580
hours of that, you know, turned up because that's a lot of, you know, dialed up to 11 that

1310
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:30,660
performance. I think two hours of that would be a bit much. I think he would know. I think he's

1311
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:34,900
professional enough to know how to tone it down for a movie. Yes. Have some restraint. He would

1312
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:40,340
be able to like dial it back and stuff because it's not just a video game. Like, I think he

1313
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:46,340
could do it. And I get it. Like it's you don't even need a big actor. Like if the thought is,

1314
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:50,820
oh, we need to get Chris Pratt in here. So people come see the movie. Yeah. It's a Super Mario movie.

1315
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:55,220
Like no one's going to care that it's Chris Pratt doing the voice or like kids aren't going to care.

1316
01:46:55,220 --> 01:47:00,420
Oh, I only want to see that Chris Pratt movie. You know, it's like they're coming to see Mario.

1317
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:07,380
That's what it is. I like the trailer more than you might think I did. I'm actually with Tiger

1318
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:11,940
Claw with something he said in chat here. This might surprise you, but I actually am. I'm really

1319
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:17,060
big on this. Tiger Claw says the new Super Mario movie looks like what if Nintendo made a new Mario

1320
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:22,260
game in 4k? Because the attention to detail on Bowser is just astounding. We're so used to

1321
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:27,460
these characters in such a way. Because Nintendo always draws these characters with less details.

1322
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:32,020
And for me, Tiger Claw hit it on the head. If not, if nothing else, this trailer makes me

1323
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:36,420
incredibly frustrated. Nintendo can't get with the fucking times when it comes to current gaming

1324
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:40,580
hardware. And I get it. That's their vision. That's not where they want. That's not necessarily

1325
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:44,660
where they want to be. Maybe they want to do this for the movies. Nintendo is not going to cry for

1326
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:48,260
me because they're just going to laugh and laugh and laugh while they're rolling in that Uncle

1327
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:56,100
Scrooge Money pit. But yeah, it makes me go, fuck, I wish this was a game. You know? But yeah,

1328
01:47:56,100 --> 01:48:00,260
Jack Black as Bowser was good. The whole thing with the penguins and that whole sequence was cute.

1329
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:06,100
Chris Pratt, you know, in the interest of fairness, you're right, we didn't get enough of

1330
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:09,700
him. But this was your chance to show it off. And I think they blew it.

1331
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:18,020
I am to be fair, like, it also it doesn't help that he like sold it. Like, you know, I've,

1332
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:24,980
I've really like, come up with this unique voice. It's like, it's just your voice. Like, like, and

1333
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:29,620
let's be honest, like the Lego movie and stuff. I love the Lego movie and I love them it and stuff,

1334
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:34,580
but it's just Chris Pratt's voice. Like, it's not like he's doing anything unique with it.

1335
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:40,020
Jack Black is Bowser. I don't hear Jack Black in that. Like, that just sounds like a completely

1336
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:45,620
unique character. Keegan-Michael Kay as Toad was as Toad. That's gonna be awesome. And even Charlie

1337
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:51,940
Day as Luigi. I love it. I think it's gonna be great. I'm gonna give it a chance. For those that

1338
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:57,380
are just oversaturated with Chris Pratt, which I'm kind of there too, although I like all the

1339
01:48:57,380 --> 01:49:01,700
other people in the movie. So I feel like I'm just going to tolerate it. But I think DJ Rama S has a

1340
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:04,900
great idea. Dark Soccer, I don't know if you've heard this one because I know you've, you've,

1341
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:09,460
you've had your fill of Chris Pratt, but DJ Rama S said, check out the trailer in a different

1342
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:15,460
language because some of the other voice actors in the other languages are different. And so I

1343
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:20,180
was like, Oh yeah, the French one sounds good. Yeah. Watching the Mario movie in Japanese might

1344
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:26,180
actually be super interesting. So I thought that was an interesting sort of way to enjoy the movie,

1345
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:32,980
even if you don't want to hear Chris Pratt. So fifth dream in chat says Danny DeVito for Mario.

1346
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:36,900
No, no, no, no. They're, they are saving him for the Zelda movie so he can play Tingle. Remember?

1347
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,780
Danny DeVito for Wario.

1348
01:49:42,020 --> 01:49:46,820
That would be such a good sequel. That would be such a good sequel. All right.

1349
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:53,780
DJ Rama S in chat says the fact that the Brazilian and German Marios gave Mario an Italian accent.

1350
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:58,740
All right. Let's move on. I know that was last week's news, but people, let's be real. People

1351
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:02,580
are still talking about it this week. And yeah, there's some things from last week we had to get

1352
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:07,940
out. All right. Moving on. Loki. I feel like this, this story keeps coming up over and over again.

1353
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:13,460
It's like the onion layers keep unpeeling and the situation gets worse, right? Loki? Because I feel

1354
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:18,580
like we've reported on this like three times, but it's worse. This was last month. So 2k had,

1355
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:25,380
they had a data breach when hackers were able to get access to their support desk. And

1356
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:32,340
they were basically impersonating the official channel in order to get a hold of people's data.

1357
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:39,940
And at, at the time they weren't sure what had been taken, but now, now they know.

1358
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:45,780
So it says that there was an email sent out to those who were affected by

1359
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:51,700
no indication of any financial information or passwords held on our systems were compromised.

1360
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:55,540
They were just able to get hold of, you know, the non-important stuff like, you know,

1361
01:50:55,540 --> 01:51:00,340
some personal data that was recorded when you contacted us for support, including your email

1362
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:07,220
address, help desk ID, gamer tag, and console details. You know, not important stuff, of course.

1363
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:15,380
Um, and that data had been put up for sale online. So everybody that's been affected

1364
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:23,140
will be receiving, um, a request to reset their passwords, um, and also keep an eye on their

1365
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:29,620
account for suspicious activity. I'm like, do I have a 2k account? I don't even know.

1366
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:34,500
Like, I guess I need to just play borderlands. You may have one with the original borderlands. Yeah.

1367
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:38,340
Yeah. I'm thinking the civilization games. I don't know if I need it.

1368
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:41,300
So like we haven't, I don't think I've ever contacted.

1369
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:48,260
I know I haven't. So probably not. Okay. Good to know. All right. Well, uh, one of the other

1370
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:52,180
big things that came up in the past couple of weeks, but, um, it's continuing on into this

1371
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:57,060
week, of course, is Overwatch two's launch. Uh, and some of the news we got this week is that

1372
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:02,820
Blizzard is going to be doing, uh, their apology tour 2022 for some of the aspects of, uh,

1373
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:09,140
Overwatch two's launch. Look, here's the thing. Here's the thing. If you were pissed off at what

1374
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:14,100
happened with Overwatch two, the first day, clearly you've never been around for a game when it

1375
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:19,060
launches and it's, it's launch day ever before. I think it's the other stuff though. Like,

1376
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:26,260
like the fact that they're requiring you to have an actual phone to like to be able to log in or

1377
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:31,940
like the fact that they did backtrack on that. If you've played the game in 2021, that that would,

1378
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:35,780
that would, uh, reactivate your account for, since you don't need a phone to tie it to it.

1379
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:40,420
So that was one of the things that they changed after the launch. Um, but some of the other things

1380
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:43,780
are going to do to sorta like, you know, entice fans to keep checking it out, you know what,

1381
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:48,260
but here's, here's the thing at the end of the day, they're not exactly crying because they

1382
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:53,140
also are touting 25 million people have played the game so far. So this has definitely pushed the

1383
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:58,260
game Overwatch, you know, in general, back to the forefront of a lot of gamers minds.

1384
01:52:58,260 --> 01:53:01,940
So blizzard's doing okay. You know, as far as this whole thing's concerned,

1385
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:06,260
because I think people wanted to check it out. I'm not sure necessarily the people are continuing

1386
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:10,980
with it. I'll be very curious what it looks like in a month for sure. But some ways that

1387
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:14,980
blizzard is going to try to sweeten it up a little bit. They're going to do some double match XP

1388
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:20,020
weekends, which will help you, uh, level through your battle pass even quicker. If you log in

1389
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:25,620
between October 25th and the end of season one, you can get a captain Reaper, legendary skin,

1390
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:30,340
and a health pack weapon charms. Those are kind of the, I think the weapon charms are all new

1391
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:33,460
and they're pretty cool. Uh, those are automatically added to your collection.

1392
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:37,540
If you log in within that period of time, uh, blizzard's also talking about more stability

1393
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:41,220
updates. Uh, there's going to be another patch this week and there'll be looking for other

1394
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:45,540
issues and bugs as they come up. So, um, that's, that's all good. You know, again,

1395
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:49,700
I had a good time when I played the other night, I actually was really happy. My account merge

1396
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:57,300
finished. And so I got all of the skins from my PC, my Xbox that like the week that they were

1397
01:53:57,300 --> 01:54:02,260
doing it free, like a free trial. I played it and I got some rare stuff and a PlayStation I had on

1398
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:06,980
PlayStation as well. And I had some rare skins. Those are all finally merged. So I was like,

1399
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:11,300
shit, I actually have a lot of skins in this game from just having like played it on several

1400
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:17,780
different devices previously. So that, that alone made Overwatch two for me, like worth checking

1401
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:24,340
out is always like, Oh damn, I still have a lot of, um, cosmetics and things to mess around with.

1402
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:32,420
And Sombra is still a lot of fun to play. Just saying. All right. Let's go back to a classic

1403
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:39,300
time when you did not need a, uh, cell phone in order to, uh, play a fun game, mostly because

1404
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:42,500
cell phones didn't really exist yet. Uh, let's go into this next segment.

1405
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:58,340
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1406
01:54:58,340 --> 01:55:03,300
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

1407
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:12,020
And Dark Sakura, what is the classic handheld of the month? Because once a month you mix it up and

1408
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:19,140
do a handheld beer, going the Coleco route and going for the Coleco tabletop arcade collection,

1409
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:29,700
which I always, always wanted and never could get. Um, my, my, uh, cousin had, had one and it was,

1410
01:55:30,580 --> 01:55:39,060
they were, they were fine. So, um, the, these were made and released in 1982 by Coleco,

1411
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:48,180
same Coleco of the ColecoVision and the Coleco Adam. Um, they were mini arcade cabinet replicas

1412
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:55,380
and, uh, they were pretty, pretty cool. Um, they'd had success with their electronic

1413
01:55:55,380 --> 01:56:00,740
quarterback in the past and with, you know, the different successes that they had with

1414
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:07,060
those systems, they decided to do the miniature tabletop arcade games. They had licenses from Sega

1415
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:14,180
Midway and Nintendo. They did their first four, which was Pac-Man, Donkey Kong,

1416
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:21,380
Galaxian and Frogger. They were an instant hit. They sold over 3 million units by the end of the

1417
01:56:21,380 --> 01:56:34,740
year. And Pac-Man sold 1.5 million units alone and they expanded it in 1983. They did, uh,

1418
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:41,220
Ms. Pac-Man, Donkey Kong Jr. and Zaxxon. Um, they were marketed as the arcade games that you can

1419
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:47,700
take with you. They used it, used a VFD, a vacuum fluorescent display. So it was really high quality

1420
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:58,820
for its day and really just nice. They, um, they, the ones that Atari was doing were, you know,

1421
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:05,620
especially on the 2600, they're pretty crude versions. Cliko ones were, were a step above

1422
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:16,100
that. They were in production from 1982, 1983 and discontinued in 1984. They, uh, they were preceded

1423
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:22,820
by the Cliko head to head series and they were the last, uh, from what I can tell that Cliko made.

1424
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:29,300
They did have two in process that were, uh, ended up unreleased and canceled. There was supposed to

1425
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:38,500
be Berserk and Omega Race. But I mean, like I had seen these in movies and the Zaxxon one was pretty

1426
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:48,020
freaking big. And you know, like I said, my, um, my cousin had one and I like, it was the second

1427
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:53,780
generation of them. The ones that came out in 93 were bigger, wider screens. But you know, there's

1428
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:59,460
just something pretty special about these. You know, it was your own little mini arcade cabinet

1429
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:05,700
and we have an outgrown dad arcade one up. So I don't have one sitting behind me right now or

1430
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:10,740
anything. I don't have three of them on the floor, not the cabinet like you have, but the smaller

1431
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:19,700
tabletop ones. But I mean, it was, it really was just miles ahead of what anyone else was

1432
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:26,820
doing at the time. You know, good on Cliko for making them, although, you know, they,

1433
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:33,620
they went into their own home console business too. And I must say that the Cliko vision

1434
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:44,420
was also well above what Atari was doing. Cliko vision and the Atari 5200 are probably the

1435
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:50,100
closest comparison for game versions. Although I do still think Cliko vision versions of some

1436
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:54,420
of these games are better, but going back to the handhelds, they were cool. If you can find them,

1437
01:58:54,420 --> 01:59:03,460
holy shit. Yeah, right guys, if you guys find a Galaxian, give it to me. The end.

1438
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:11,940
All right. There it is the classic handheld of the month. I had a friend who had these and they

1439
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:16,500
were so cool. Like again, yeah, you have to remember this was 1982. You know, the tech

1440
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:22,020
and these things for the time was awesome. They may look look really rudimentary now. But like,

1441
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:27,060
this was this was it like when we were kids. Yeah, this is a contemporary of some of the

1442
01:59:27,060 --> 01:59:33,380
other ones that I've mentioned. And this was way, way ahead of its time, especially with the nature

1443
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:37,860
of the display that it used. And yeah, maybe Donkey Kong looks like a purple blob. But it's

1444
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:43,860
playable. Yeah, it's playable. Tiger Claw is dropping some links in chat over archive.org,

1445
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:48,900
where you can actually play the games online. You know, granted, it's not quite the same thrill

1446
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:53,380
playing it in a browser window is like playing the little device and so forth. But it's a it's

1447
01:59:53,380 --> 02:00:00,580
a nice little way to, you know, kind of remember what it was archive.org slash details slash hh

1448
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:07,300
underscore C D Kong will get you to Donkey Kong. That's what search and from the hour just do a

1449
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:12,180
web search. And from there, I'm sure you can find all the others. So pretty cool. All right. Great

1450
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:17,140
pick dark soccer. Thanks for sharing. All right. I can't believe we only have two handhelds left.

1451
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:19,860
And then we have to start thinking about what are you gonna do in 2023?

1452
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:26,820
Fuck me. All right. Um, I'll take some suggestions. Hit me up on the twatters.

1453
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:33,860
Sorry, the twitters. And DM me your suggestions. I'll like the best one and take credit for it.

1454
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:35,380
Yeah. Getting getting getting.

1455
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:43,860
I have I have an eye. Can I can I pitch my idea? Sure. Okay. So this might be a little weird. I

1456
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:46,340
don't know. I'd have to see what the what the listeners think about this. But that's why I'm

1457
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:50,660
going to pitch it live. So instead of the classic game of the week, every month, you're going to

1458
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:58,100
pick one game that's destined to be a classic. They're all eventually going to be classic.

1459
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:03,220
They're all getting old time. I guess that's true by your rules of a classic game of the week.

1460
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:08,020
You've got you've covered some pretty crap games. So anything can be a classic game of the week. It

1461
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:11,300
just has to be, you know, something that's impacted us in one way or another for better

1462
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:19,060
or for worse. So highlight company shut down by EA. Stop. Oh, classic game studio. Ah,

1463
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:26,100
that might be interesting. We'll see. All right. Classic mod. Maybe. I don't know. We'll see. All

1464
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:30,660
right. There could be some fun things. All right. Tweeter tweet. I know you all are in chat, but

1465
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:34,580
we'll forget after the show tonight. Send dark soccer tweet. Those last much longer.

1466
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:39,140
Do me a tweet. All right. Even even though her Twitter gonna blow up tonight. All right.

1467
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:43,460
Well, my Twitter's already done been blowing up, so whatevs.

1468
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:48,100
All right. Moving on. Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other

1469
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:51,460
news around the industry that's happening this week. Loki.

1470
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:57,780
Yeah, there was a promotional video that came out from Valve showing off the steam deck.

1471
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:04,260
Unfortunately, they said the quiet part out loud that the steam deck is a great device to use for

1472
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:13,620
emulation. And they had a Yuzu featured in there. The switch emulator in their video. Whoops. They

1473
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:21,220
have now fixed that problem, but it is funny to see that, you know. It's well known for

1474
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:30,420
play switch games on the steam deck. It's like a big switch. And then the final fantasy seven

1475
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:38,660
battle royale game, the final seven first soldier is going to be shutting down January 11th, 2023.

1476
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:46,420
Launched last year and apparently wasn't popular enough for Square Enix to keep it going. So

1477
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:54,100
they will be shutting it down. I forgot that this even came out.

1478
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:58,660
I did too, and that's probably part of the problem, to be honest.

1479
02:02:59,620 --> 02:03:06,500
Yeah. All right. Moving on. Sorry. I just a really funny one that just came up in Chat Dark Sakura.

1480
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:12,180
The classic classic game of the week segment where we go back and we pick a segment that's

1481
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:19,780
10 years or older and re-air it. What I might be. I'll tell you actually what I'm thinking

1482
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:26,660
about doing is classic game All-Stars. Okay. Oh, okay. Like Dragula Titans,

1483
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:30,420
Drag Race All-Stars. We're the best of the best compete.

1484
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:38,340
And more than that, I'm thinking what we do is all three of us pick one the week before.

1485
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:46,900
And we have, or we put it on Twitter and we have our listeners vote.

1486
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:49,540
Are you talking about a classic game royale?

1487
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:58,740
I am. We start off, we each pick a game, keeping it on the same system.

1488
02:03:58,740 --> 02:04:04,100
Classic cage match would throw it way back. Classic gaming cage match.

1489
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:09,700
Oh, I think we got to do that. A classic cage match. Oh, that's good.

1490
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:16,420
So we announced the games the week before the cage match. We put up a vote on our Twitter.

1491
02:04:16,420 --> 02:04:21,940
And so how do we make it so that Loki's game doesn't win every single month?

1492
02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:26,900
Well, we don't say whose game is what we just put the three games based on the game.

1493
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:36,180
And then there's a review. Then reveal yourself who picked what game? Ah, okay. All right.

1494
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:40,580
And also, it's really awesome because I pulled that out of my ass right the moment I said it.

1495
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:44,340
And SS Joe and her mat says got to have a theme for every month. And I

1496
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:49,620
say we let a listener pick the theme. No, I pick it. This is my second.

1497
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:54,340
Okay, you pick the theme. But I'll be happy to take suggestions.

1498
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:02,420
Don't take this from me. No, it's I love it. The classic cage

1499
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:07,220
match is great. It's a great classic gaming cage match. Classic gaming cage match. Oh,

1500
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:14,020
we've already picked before. It can be Why not? Why not? All right.

1501
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:18,660
I have a pretty extensive list. All right. I'm excited. 2023 needs to

1502
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:23,220
hurry up and get here. All right. In the meantime, oh, I shit I have a rapid fire

1503
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:30,660
story. I'm supposed to talk about Hello. Oh, yes. CD Projekt Red is making a sequel to Cyberpunk

1504
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:36,020
2077. There's a part of me that says of course they are but at the same time the way that game

1505
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:41,700
was received may actually be a little bit surprising. So there were some slightly better

1506
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:46,820
now. Yeah, there were some slides. Well, and to throw back a couple weeks ago, we were talking

1507
02:05:46,820 --> 02:05:53,940
about Google stadia. Let us not forget for the stadia people. This game was fine. It was always

1508
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:59,700
fine. So it's just interesting how that's all worked out. Anyway, um, CD Projekt is still

1509
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:04,020
super pissed. I know I know I'm so no, I'm more pissed that they're putting out a cloud gaming

1510
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:11,060
system now. I didn't even hear about that. What? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'll find the details. Go

1511
02:06:11,060 --> 02:06:16,580
ahead. Okay, find the details. But but let me finish for you interrupt. All right. So CD

1512
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:21,780
Projekt is doing a new they were announcing upcoming projects. So in a slide they talked

1513
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:27,460
about this interesting because they were revealing project names, such as project Canis Majoris,

1514
02:06:27,460 --> 02:06:32,100
which is a story driven single player open world RPG within the Witcher universe.

1515
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,780
So I mean, it sounds like the Witcher four, but it could be a spin off game, who knows.

1516
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:42,020
But then there was a game called Project Orion, cyberpunk 2077 sequel that will prove the full

1517
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:48,660
power and potential of the cyberpunk universe. So in so they're gonna they're gonna try again,

1518
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:53,780
I wonder if they aren't going to recycle the engine to make a new game to try to save on dev

1519
02:06:53,780 --> 02:06:59,860
time, that would be a very smart thing to do. Now that they've figured things out. I found the thing

1520
02:06:59,860 --> 02:07:07,700
by the way, go ahead. So there, Google is doing Chromebooks built for cloud gaming.

1521
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:17,380
They're working with Acer, Asus and Lenovo. And this came out on the 11th of this month,

1522
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:22,820
just after the stadia thing, which proves to me that this has nothing to do with stadia

1523
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:31,460
management. This came from higher up at Google. I can see it no other way.

1524
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:36,500
Yeah. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some things we'll be seeing a lot

1525
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:41,380
sooner than the classic cage match of the month. The world release dates. Loki, what's coming out

1526
02:07:41,380 --> 02:07:48,740
in the US? We have a Plague Tale Requiem on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation five and Xbox series.

1527
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:50,820
It's on Game Pass, by the way, I've been looking forward to it.

1528
02:07:51,620 --> 02:07:58,100
Ghostbusters spirits unleashed on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

1529
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:04,820
Them's fighting herds, I think coming out of early access on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four,

1530
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:10,100
PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series. The people who did fight of animals, is it? No.

1531
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:16,740
It's the one that was going to be the my little pony fighting game, but then they had to make it

1532
02:08:16,740 --> 02:08:23,620
not legally distinct by a little pony fighting game. So now that's coming out.

1533
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:25,700
I mean, it's all things considered.

1534
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:39,380
Last hero of nostalgia on PC, Xbox one, Xbox series. The last worker on PC. We have uncharted

1535
02:08:39,380 --> 02:08:48,740
Legacy of Thieves collection also on PC. We've got Dragon Quest 10 online, all in one package,

1536
02:08:48,740 --> 02:08:55,060
version one through six. That's the name on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.

1537
02:08:55,780 --> 02:09:03,940
We have the Jackbox Party Pack nine on PC, Mac and Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four,

1538
02:09:03,940 --> 02:09:09,620
PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series, Cestadia. I don't know about that. And Luna.

1539
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:19,380
We've got Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope on Nintendo Switch, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher

1540
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:30,340
on Nintendo Switch. And let's see, Warhammer 40,000, Shootas, Blood and Teeth. And that's

1541
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:36,340
going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series,

1542
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:44,020
Gotham Knights on PC, PlayStation five and Xbox series, New Tales from the Borderlands on PC,

1543
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:50,340

1544
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:57,220
Royale on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. That is it.

1545
02:09:58,100 --> 02:10:05,220
Oh, is that all? All right. Moving over to Japan on the Nintendo Switch, Ultra Kaiju Monster

1546
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:10,900
Rancher is out this week on the 20th of October as is Space Marshals collection.

1547
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:16,420
Not the Space Marshals is not ringing a bell, but there were three Space Marshals games. I don't

1548
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:21,140
know why this doesn't ring a bell, but yeah, Space Marshals one, two and three in a collection on the

1549
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:26,900
Switch. Let's see. We also have a Harmonia getting a English release, but it is in Japan. It's just

1550
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:32,900
not localized. There's also Lego Brawls is out in Japan this week. This is pretty cool. A Dragon

1551
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:38,180
Quest 10 online all in one package with versions one through six. So it's basically like a Uber

1552
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:43,860
version of Dragon Quest 10. That is out on the Switch in Japan this week as well. And if we move

1553
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:52,980
over to Oh, of course, I should. Sorry, nevermind. We'll go over to the PlayStation five. And I will

1554
02:10:53,060 --> 02:11:00,580
mention Lego Brawls, Human Fall Flat are both out there as well. And PlayStation five gets a Gran

1555
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:07,860
Turismo seven bundle. So they're actually releasing a Gran Turismo seven, like PlayStation five. Is

1556
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:14,660
that just did they just do a different? No, I think it's literally just the same old console

1557
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:21,380
with the game. Okay. All right. I thought I thought they would do like a special controller or

1558
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:26,660
something but doesn't look like it. All right. Also on the PlayStation five, Persona five,

1559
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:32,340
The Royal is out in Japan this week on the 21st. How about Europe Dark Soccer?

1560
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:42,740
On 18th on Xbox, we have a Plague Tale Requiem. Also on the 18th, we have them's Fighting Hearts

1561
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:50,420

1562
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:56,500
and also on Switch Matchpoint Tennis Championships Legend Edition. On the 21st for

1563
02:11:56,500 --> 02:12:02,820
PlayStation and Xbox, we have Gotham Knights. And adding Switch to that we have Persona five Royal,

1564
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:11,620
also Fell Seal Arbiter's Mark, New Tales from the Borderlands, also on the 21st.

1565
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:20,100
Excellent. We have to send a little ASMR. I'm very sorry because I hate ASMR.

1566
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:22,980
No, we talked about it at the beginning of the show. You're a little under the weather

1567
02:12:22,980 --> 02:12:28,980
and it's affecting your voice. So let's have Loki and I take a couple headlines here and then we'll

1568
02:12:28,980 --> 02:12:33,620
get to the listener roundtable tonight. So Loki, what do you have to talk about with us?

1569
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:48,340
All right. It's another week, another lawsuit, right? So Activision now has another lawsuit

1570
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:58,100
that is talking about more sexual harassment allegations. Revenge porn is another part of this

1571
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:02,500
as well. Which is illegal in the state of California, by the way, where, you know,

1572
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:05,940
Blizzard's located. I don't know what studio this is, but yeah.

1573
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:13,220
So this was filed in LA by an unnamed former employee of the company and targets Activision

1574
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:20,260
Blizzard along with the former manager of this employee, Miguel Vega. And they alleged that

1575
02:13:20,260 --> 02:13:26,740
Activision Blizzard's failure to curb sexist and harassing conduct emboldened the manager

1576
02:13:26,740 --> 02:13:34,980
to abuse belittle and insult of the one making this claim, making comments about her about oral

1577
02:13:34,980 --> 02:13:40,820
sex masturbation and orgasms threatening her job. If she would not consent to sex, mocking her

1578
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:47,140
breasts comment are commenting on other females, employees, attractiveness, also repeatedly threat

1579
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:57,540
to expose a compromising photo of her as well. And then apparently one, the, they were, she

1580
02:13:57,540 --> 02:14:06,180
reported her concerns. They immediately opened an investigation and Mr. Vega was terminated within

1581
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:18,820
10 days, according to Activision. Also it says that, I mean, it's just, it's just sexual harassment.

1582
02:14:18,820 --> 02:14:25,860
It goes into more details about like groping and attempting sexual harassment, you know, abuse and

1583
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:35,860
just terrible shit. Yep. So I got nothing. This is, this is a problem that needs to be, I mean,

1584
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:42,660
at least he was fired pretty immediately, but, uh, it should have happened before any of this and

1585
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:47,700
recognized before any of this ever happened. So, I mean, it's one of those things like, I, I, I

1586
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:52,100
don't know what nice thing to say about this because there is nothing nice about it, but I will

1587
02:14:52,100 --> 02:14:58,660
say it's an industry problem and we need to, and probably goes beyond the video game industry too.

1588
02:14:58,660 --> 02:15:05,060
And shitty people need to stop coming to power. Well, right. And these people are, you know,

1589
02:15:05,060 --> 02:15:08,340
it seems like we're hearing about more and more of these people at the company. It's not like

1590
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:16,740
one-offs almost because they're just seeing leadership above them kind of doing the same

1591
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:22,660
thing or condoning this behavior. And so, like they said, it emboldens them to just continue

1592
02:15:22,660 --> 02:15:31,140
it on and starts at the top. Right. I agree. That's why I've been screaming until I

1593
02:15:31,140 --> 02:15:37,060
turned blue. Bobby Kotick has no place in this industry. And every day he still sits at the top

1594
02:15:37,060 --> 02:15:43,540
of a major company is disgusting. Moving on. I need something lighthearted and fun. Loki,

1595
02:15:43,540 --> 02:15:45,620
please change the topic to something completely different.

1596
02:15:46,660 --> 02:15:56,180
Uh, yes. So apparently, uh, the, there was a Kingdom Hearts TV series that, um, was

1597
02:15:56,180 --> 02:16:02,580
supposed to come out and then they got canceled. So the series was directed and developed by

1598
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:15,940
discovery. Um, it was no Disney TV. And apparently, um, he back in 2018, or I guess

1599
02:16:15,940 --> 02:16:22,820
recently he's was in a serious car crash, I guess in January that almost cost him his life. So he

1600
02:16:22,820 --> 02:16:28,020
figured that he wanted to, uh, share the work with the world. Um, you know, put it out there

1601
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:34,660
in case anything bad happened to him. Um, he posted the video it's been pulled off the internet

1602
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:41,460
or at least his channel, but I mean, search for lost Kingdom Hearts pilot animatic, and you can

1603
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:48,500
check it out and it kind of shows, you know, just an animatic for what the pilot episode would have

1604
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:56,180
been. And it's, it's looks like, yeah. I mean, I could see this being like kind of a Saturday

1605
02:16:56,180 --> 02:17:00,900
morning cartoon type thing. Yeah. I'm surprised Disney never, I'm surprised Disney never tried

1606
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:04,980
to make Kingdom Hearts more mainstream. And yeah, it was super easy to find.

1607
02:17:04,980 --> 02:17:09,940
You know, I've, I've complained about this on the show before, and I think Dark Soccer,

1608
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:14,500
you brought it up and Loki probably mentioned it too, is that, you know, when we were really

1609
02:17:15,140 --> 02:17:19,940
obsessed with Disneyland and I'm saying that and realizing, oh, and Dark Soccer just went on Monday

1610
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:24,580
after TwitchCon. Did you see anything Kingdom Hearts related in the parks?

1611
02:17:25,460 --> 02:17:31,300
I did. Oh, oh, all right. I saw people wearing, wearing shirts and I bought pins.

1612
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:35,460
Okay. I've already bought, there were already a few Kingdom Hearts pins and

1613
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:39,060
there were, um, I want to say I saw some ornaments.

1614
02:17:39,060 --> 02:17:43,700
Yeah. But you know, I just, and especially 10 years ago and when, you know, Kingdom Hearts,

1615
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:46,260
when there wasn't a Kingdom Hearts three yet and one and two were still,

1616
02:17:46,260 --> 02:17:49,940
I was always surprised in the parks. There's a Sora mascot in Japan.

1617
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:56,420
Right. But not here. I'm, I'm still always kind of like blown away that Disney did not

1618
02:17:56,420 --> 02:18:00,260
really throw more weight behind Kingdom Hearts. And I just assume some of that must've been

1619
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:03,460
complications with the square agreement and just what they could and couldn't do.

1620
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:10,100
But it's just so wild to me that Disney, I mean, yeah, I just purchase everything. I'm

1621
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:13,540
surprised. I just don't know why they didn't put more weight into Kingdom Hearts, you know?

1622
02:18:14,420 --> 02:18:17,300
Like if they wanted to, they could just buy Square Enix and be like, okay,

1623
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:21,300
we own you now that we can do whatever we want with this. I mean, like, I don't know.

1624
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:26,900
Um, dartitsuyu in chat says, I do remember seeing Sora and interventions. I think the last time I

1625
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:31,540
went was 2005. Yeah. The intervention building, which by the way, I think it's a restaurant now.

1626
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:34,500
Didn't you say that? It is. Yeah. It was a skyline terrace.

1627
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:38,820
So before that, uh, it was, you know, it was America Sings years and years ago,

1628
02:18:38,820 --> 02:18:43,140
but then it was a building that was like showing exhibitions of, of like science and they,

1629
02:18:43,140 --> 02:18:46,900
I think they did Marvel photo ops for a bit. I don't think it was ever America Sings.

1630
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:53,060
I thought it was, it was like America, not America Sings, America 3d or something.

1631
02:18:53,620 --> 02:19:01,700
It was, it was, um, it had like this 3d like, um, uh, crap. What was that? An incredible journey

1632
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:13,780
body thing, but it had that was another thing in there. But, um, but they had like lots of stuff

1633
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:18,900
sponsored by like DuPont and different industrial things. Cause they were the donors for the park.

1634
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:25,140
And so that's what the innovations building was for. But I do remember for a short time to go

1635
02:19:25,140 --> 02:19:29,540
back to dartitsuyu's comment, they, they did show like video gamey things in there. I remember Xbox

1636
02:19:29,540 --> 02:19:33,780
360 connect was like a thing they were showing in there and they would like the Disneyland game

1637
02:19:33,780 --> 02:19:38,580
was on connect. Remember that that was definitely in the interventions building. So I think they

1638
02:19:38,580 --> 02:19:43,700
Sora was probably in there tied to like video games or the future, you know, type of thing that

1639
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:48,260
was in there. So yeah, they probably had like a big, you know, Sora standee or something that

1640
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:54,900
sat in there. So it makes sense. All right. Well, speaking of Disney, I didn't, uh, totally mean to,

1641
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:57,940
to try it, but I guess when you bring up kingdom hearts, you're going to, um,

1642
02:19:59,220 --> 02:20:06,020
there's going to be some new features coming to Disney dreamlight valley, which a lot of people,

1643
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:10,740
especially a lot of streamers have been getting into. Uh, I still am kind of like,

1644
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:14,420
eh, it's early access. I'll wait until they've, they've fleshed it out a little more with some

1645
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:20,100
features and some of the features that they're going to be working on include interacting with

1646
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:25,540
your animal companions. And this all came out in an interview, uh, that was, uh, happening on,

1647
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:29,620
I guess the official Twitter feed, there was a survey and, uh, the survey asked,

1648
02:20:29,620 --> 02:20:35,620
do you want to be able to interact with your animal companions? Uh, that is so they,

1649
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:39,700
they wrote a tweet that said, Hey, valley villagers, we've been wondering, would you

1650
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:44,500
like to be able to interact with your animal companions? And the choices were yes, yes,

1651
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:50,580
or yes, in the next update. So, uh, pretty much way of confirming, uh, that that's going to be

1652
02:20:50,580 --> 02:20:54,900
happening, uh, there. So yeah, Disney, uh, dreamlight valley is going to be able to, uh,

1653
02:20:54,900 --> 02:21:01,140
pet your pets. So, uh, they'll have to update the website. Can you pet the dog? Although I don't

1654
02:21:01,140 --> 02:21:05,860
mean, I don't know if that means you can pet goofy, but just like your, your animal companions,

1655
02:21:05,860 --> 02:21:10,900
but we'll find out, maybe you can pet goofy as well. I don't know. So that tweet is already

1656
02:21:10,980 --> 02:21:17,620
starting an argument. The what? My tweet has already started a bit of a fuss. Oh boy.

1657
02:21:17,620 --> 02:21:25,700
I love it. All right. Meanwhile, come visit my Twitch channel to hear me say more about it.

1658
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:31,860
What if they interpreted it as kicking them? And they'd be like, this is what you voted for.

1659
02:21:31,860 --> 02:21:41,540
What? What are you even saying? All right. Oh, kicking the animals. That's mean. Yeah,

1660
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:46,820
that's mean. Who would vote for that? You should, whoever voted for that gets instantly blocked.

1661
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:51,620
That's what should happen. And pet whichever cat that is talking. Oh, uh, that is, uh,

1662
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:59,860
I think that's smush in the background. So. All right. Uh, let's, uh, let's move on and get into

1663
02:21:59,860 --> 02:22:04,500
the listener round table, where we invite you to email the show every week. Participate

1664
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:09,460
at orange lounge, radio.com. I don't think we got emails this week though, if I recall correctly,

1665
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:12,260
but I'll check with dark soccer. I know your voice is out. If I need to get in there and

1666
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:15,940
read something, I can, but I don't even look, I'm sorry. I don't think we have anything to be

1667
02:22:15,940 --> 02:22:21,860
honest. Um, that's okay. Peek in there and let me know. Um, and if I need to jump in there, I will.

1668
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:28,660
Usually all those get forwarded to my personal email too. One second. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

1669
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:33,300
but again, if you want to email us for a future week, you sure can participate at orange lounge,

1670
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:40,500
radio.com is the place to send those emails. All right. I didn't think so. Okay. Um, maybe you have

1671
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:47,220
further questions or thoughts on Twitch con or the variety of, uh, uh, kickoff topics we had tonight,

1672
02:22:47,220 --> 02:22:53,700
uh, starting off the show, we will also invite your calls, uh, via our discord channel. Uh,

1673
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:59,540
if you want to join our discord vog network.com slash discord, uh, is the place to chat with us

1674
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:02,980
throughout the week. And it was, it was really active today with everything that's been going

1675
02:23:02,980 --> 02:23:08,020
on in the industry. If I may real quick. Yeah, of course. Um, I, I wanted to say this at the

1676
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:15,220
start. My mom had to go into the ER. Um, and turns out she has a multifocal pneumonia. It just means

1677
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:19,700
she's got different pockets of pneumonia in her lungs and she's in the hospital right now. And I

1678
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:26,900
would greatly appreciate some positive sent her way. Absolutely. Absolutely. Send, send in some

1679
02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:34,660
positive feelings and keeping you on my thoughts. All right. Um, let's, uh, as I was saying,

1680
02:23:34,660 --> 02:23:39,700
we go to discord vog network.com slash discord. And if you want to call us live, you sure can in

1681
02:23:39,700 --> 02:23:44,020
the green room. And we actually have someone in the green room waiting to come on and join the

1682
02:23:44,020 --> 02:23:49,860
show right now. So let's get to it. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who is this? It is the

1683
02:23:49,860 --> 02:23:55,700
one and only DJ Ron mess. How's everybody doing tonight? I am doing great except this, uh, four

1684
02:23:55,700 --> 02:24:00,900
shot I have is completely messed up on Twitch. So I apologize for that. I will fix it. But, uh,

1685
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:04,660
Rama wants to tell us what's on your mind tonight. You were just on Bobby show. You must have a lot

1686
02:24:04,660 --> 02:24:10,500
to say. Yes. I understand the whole redoing whole layout I've been doing. I'm working on a brand

1687
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:15,220
new revision from my, from my Twitch stream. So fantastic. And this is my own fault. What

1688
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:22,180
happened is when I designed this, it was, um, it was, uh, made for, uh, the Twitch window being

1689
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:28,500
minimized and now it's like, it has to be maximized so you can see everybody. So there's

1690
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:33,700
like, are you trying to say something? We should talk. If you're doing a redesign, we should talk.

1691
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:39,620
Okay. I kind of doing something rough, but once I get it together, I'll send it your way. We can

1692
02:24:39,620 --> 02:24:44,580
plot something. Oh, I was like, why does dark soccer looks so smushed? But it's because Rama

1693
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:48,980
is covering her. All right. Well, the podcast listeners are like, what are you even talking

1694
02:24:48,980 --> 02:24:53,540
about? I'm trying to fix a visual disaster right now. All right. That's all I'm doing. But when

1695
02:24:53,540 --> 02:24:58,100
doing a thing, when it's done, I don't have to do it again. This is very much a fuck it. We'll do it

1696
02:24:58,100 --> 02:25:04,180
live moment, but let's talk to you. Rama live. What is on your mind tonight? My friend. I wanted

1697
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:11,300
to talk about what's going on with G four TV, but that can wait. Nothing. You know that. Wait. You

1698
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:17,700
know what? You know what the G's stand for in G four. Gotcha. Going, going, going gone.

1699
02:25:19,700 --> 02:25:24,980
Yeah. I'm sorry. That's in poor taste. I'm sorry. I, but, but I can't help it. I can't, I can't

1700
02:25:24,980 --> 02:25:32,100
help. Look, I, I grieve through the use of humor. So it doesn't stand for G. I'm surprised it took

1701
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:39,540
this long. Rama. What did you want to talk about tonight? Oh, this whole hello Taylor,

1702
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:48,580
Jennifer Hale thing. Oh, sure. Sure. Girl. Okay. As you all know, I've been part of sort of part

1703
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:53,300
of voice acting industry for awhile in the ways of knowing voice actors, hanging out with them,

1704
02:25:53,300 --> 02:26:00,180
interviewing general conversations with them. Yeah. And before I say anything,

1705
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:08,260
every voice actor should be paid their worth. They should be paid royalties based off of the physical

1706
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:13,700
copies being sold. The number of streams are being people watching streams with their voices

1707
02:26:13,700 --> 02:26:21,860
and so forth. Yep. Right. Right off the bat, like a TV actor or a movie actor. Yeah, exactly. And

1708
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:29,140
it's interesting. I was interviewing a voice actor about that earlier today, but I want to pre I

1709
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:35,140
appreciate y'all at OLR, Bobby and everybody in the discord chat breaking all of this down because

1710
02:26:35,140 --> 02:26:39,300
I'm at a convention. I had no idea what was going on. I'm picking it up piece by piece

1711
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:44,580
as I'm figuring this out. Yeah. There's a little bit more to it because you know how they say

1712
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:50,180
there are two sides to every story. Absolutely. Actually, there are four sides to every story.

1713
02:26:50,180 --> 02:26:55,380
I thought you were gonna say three, but yeah. What you said, what they said, what the people

1714
02:26:55,380 --> 02:27:01,700
think, and the truth. And by the time we get to here, nobody cares about this. Did you say what

1715
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:06,740
we get to hear? What the people think? Is this what you said? Rama? Basically? Yeah. For those

1716
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:10,260
on the podcast feed, he was using his fingers. And when he got to what the people think it was the

1717
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:15,460
middle finger. So I just was re emphasizing that people think that's a good one. I always I've

1718
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:21,700
heard your side my side in the truth. But that in this particular case, absolutely what the people

1719
02:27:21,700 --> 02:27:28,660
think is, is huge here. Yeah. What you said about this is correct, but because Helena Taylor

1720
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:32,260
voice has been, nobody wants to hear nothing else. This is no different from another

1721
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:37,380
drama with another voice actor that's going on. I've already mentioned that person's name in the

1722
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:43,140
chat. Google it. When you see it, get some coffee, some soda, some popcorn. The transcripts are

1723
02:27:43,140 --> 02:27:49,140
wonderful, but that's besides the point. There is definitely more to this than what, than what

1724
02:27:49,140 --> 02:27:56,820
we're seeing here. I mean, how can you be so bitter at after that comment? I went and looked

1725
02:27:56,820 --> 02:28:05,540
at her IMDB. I'm just like, uh huh. I can see why she's bitter, but it was completely and totally

1726
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:12,980
uncalled for. Go on, Rob. You know, you want to say, I can see it on your face. I just, that was

1727
02:28:12,980 --> 02:28:19,380
what you said was incredibly fucking shady. And I just had to, had to just stew in that for a

1728
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:26,500
minute. But no, I get it. I get it. Maybe shady, but am I wrong? And you know what?

1729
02:28:26,500 --> 02:28:34,500
Show me the lie. Let's shade and shade alike. Exactly. And the fact of the matter is she's

1730
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:39,460
trying to get people to boycott this game. That ain't happening. That's, you know, and you bring

1731
02:28:40,260 --> 02:28:48,420
I'm sorry. I support voice acting industry the absolute way that I can. Yeah. I am one of those

1732
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:52,740
who will download fan subs, but when it becomes commercially available for me to watch it,

1733
02:28:52,740 --> 02:28:57,780
I will delete the fan subs. I will watch it streaming. I will buy the DVDs. I will buy

1734
02:28:57,780 --> 02:29:04,020
merge from it. I will support any way possible. I enjoy Bayonetta. I'm going to support this

1735
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:08,660
because there's more to the what's going on. I am not canceling my pre-order. Not after the hell I

1736
02:29:08,660 --> 02:29:13,140
went through to get it the first time around. I'm not, I will. I will. I am not boycotting the game

1737
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:21,620
based on one perspective alone until we know what the truth is here because that's it's playing

1738
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:29,060
right into this. She's yeah. I, again, there's just a lot of stuff here, but what stinks Rama

1739
02:29:29,060 --> 02:29:33,860
is that there are a lot of people you say there, there are people on Twitter who are saying they're

1740
02:29:33,860 --> 02:29:37,300
going to boycott now, granted, how many of them were never going to buy it in the first place?

1741
02:29:37,300 --> 02:29:41,540
Probably a lot. Let's be real. This is how Twitter acts. People, people put on a front,

1742
02:29:41,540 --> 02:29:44,820
on Twitter all the time to look so fucking impressive. And it's like,

1743
02:29:44,820 --> 02:29:50,020
when you get to a certain age or I don't know when it's like, you see you, it's so transparent.

1744
02:29:50,020 --> 02:29:55,300
People's, you know, things, it's so transparent. You didn't cancel a pre-order. You're never going

1745
02:29:55,300 --> 02:29:59,620
to fucking buy it in the first place. You're not impressing anybody. I see right through you.

1746
02:30:00,420 --> 02:30:04,900
Now I'm sure there were some legitimate people. Show me your receipt. Yeah. And some people

1747
02:30:04,900 --> 02:30:08,660
did screenshot and show the receipt. I saw that too. I'm sure there's some that did,

1748
02:30:08,660 --> 02:30:13,540
but that isn't to say they're not going to go buy it anyway, but let's, let's see what happens

1749
02:30:13,540 --> 02:30:20,020
when more facts come out. Right. Now something similar happened. This is about within the last

1750
02:30:20,020 --> 02:30:24,740
month or so voice X, my name was Kyle McCarley. He put a video on his YouTube about a situation

1751
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:30,820
where he's a voice of mob and mob cycle 100. Basically they were going to go into season three

1752
02:30:30,820 --> 02:30:36,340
and it was going to be non-union. So, you know, the rates and the pay is totally different.

1753
02:30:36,980 --> 02:30:42,900
He reached out to crunchy roll and the studio can we figure something out here so that we can have

1754
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:50,020
the original cast to do this. It kind of fell upon deaf ears and he says, I'm not doing the role,

1755
02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:56,500
but in doing so in his video, he tells everybody, you know, continue to support as a whole,

1756
02:30:56,500 --> 02:31:01,460
you know, don't stop because of me, you know, continue to support, which is something I can

1757
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:07,220
get behind. If I can't be part of a project because XYZ reason, I don't want people to

1758
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:12,820
stop supporting said project because I'm not there. Because if you, even though I'm not there,

1759
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:17,860
if you continue to support it, it could do something else, make your voice be heard. You

1760
02:31:17,860 --> 02:31:24,900
know, let me ask a question. I'm curious what you all think on this. Do you think Nintendo of Europe

1761
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:31,940
goes to the length to sue Helena in court for trying to start a boycott of this game and

1762
02:31:31,940 --> 02:31:37,060
breaking her NDA? Do you think they sue her for defamation and breaking the NDA? Do they go to

1763
02:31:37,060 --> 02:31:42,500
that length? I honestly don't see it. They're just going to be like, okay, business as usual.

1764
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:48,500
Now, if it's now after the game comes out, if they if the projections are lower than expected,

1765
02:31:49,460 --> 02:31:56,020
maybe. But that might fall under platinum games instead of Nintendo. But we'll see.

1766
02:31:56,020 --> 02:32:02,180
Well, it gets tricky when she's in the UK and platinum is in Japan. So I'm not you know,

1767
02:32:02,180 --> 02:32:07,460
and I'm not going to profess to be a legal expert on what country is that enforced under

1768
02:32:07,460 --> 02:32:13,780
and such and such. So my assumption is Nintendo did fund the game. So they but but but let me say,

1769
02:32:14,660 --> 02:32:18,900
do does whoever she signed the NDA with, which I guess would be platinum games,

1770
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:23,380
so maybe they have a UK entity. So does platinum games sue Helena in Europe?

1771
02:32:24,820 --> 02:32:31,780
I honestly don't know. I honestly feel I think this is gonna be like a wait and see.

1772
02:32:31,780 --> 02:32:37,940
Let's see what come here has to say. That's it. Let's hear their side of the story before we

1773
02:32:37,940 --> 02:32:41,700
decide everybody's been giving him shit because he blocks everyone on Twitter, which I mean,

1774
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:45,860
I'm not excusing his behavior. He's always been a dick. But that's like his personality is being

1775
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:49,540
a dick. And I'm not saying being a dick should be a personality. But it's just one of those things

1776
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:56,420
where it's like, I the only thing I found interesting was he did call it out in English,

1777
02:32:56,420 --> 02:33:00,900
and you know how much he fucking hates tweets in English. That is in lines with his character. And

1778
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:04,100
he said in English, Damn it, I wish I had the tweet in front of me. But he fucking

1779
02:33:04,100 --> 02:33:10,980
works. Yeah, it's basically like, I want to find the tweet now because it's important.

1780
02:33:11,700 --> 02:33:17,620
It may be it may be screenshot it because I've seen it around. Yeah. But also to throw in there

1781
02:33:17,620 --> 02:33:24,820
about Helen Taylor's voice work. I can tell you this now, up into the pandemic. Oh, all the

1782
02:33:24,820 --> 02:33:30,420
police act if I may, if I may while it's in front of me, his tweet, sad and deplorable about the

1783
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:36,260
attitude of untruth. That's what all I can tell now. And then he says, by the way, beware of my

1784
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:40,580
rules where don't tweet at me in English or I'll block you and all the dicky things he's famous

1785
02:33:40,580 --> 02:33:44,740
for. But you know what, say what you will about Kamiya. I understand being addiction be a

1786
02:33:44,740 --> 02:33:48,500
personality, especially in the gaming industry where we have plenty of it already. However,

1787
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:53,380
the fact that he did tweet that and say, he basically said she's lying. So he's saying

1788
02:33:53,380 --> 02:34:00,500
she's lying. So I'm very curious to see, you know, but again, I don't know if it's ever

1789
02:34:00,500 --> 02:34:03,380
in a place where we do see it unless it comes out in court documents.

1790
02:34:03,380 --> 02:34:11,140
Again, I honestly don't see it going to that length unless what she does causes a ripple

1791
02:34:11,140 --> 02:34:18,340
effect in the sales of the game. But let me just finish it with this and I'll be on my merry

1792
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:24,420
little way. Yes, I did throw shade at her at the work that she's on IMDb because sometimes when you

1793
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:30,500
put yourself out there, it's going to happen. But when it comes to voice acting up into the pandemic,

1794
02:34:31,140 --> 02:34:35,940
you had to be in the studio for it. So there really aren't that many.

1795
02:34:37,460 --> 02:34:44,100
All the anime is in the UK is being dubbed here in the US. So as she really wanted to get up there,

1796
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:50,260
she would have to move from the UK to the US now during the pan at the beginning and the height of

1797
02:34:50,260 --> 02:34:58,740
the pan. Damn it. I know. Damn it. Yep. The pan. Damn it. They bought expensive microphones,

1798
02:34:58,740 --> 02:35:03,620
digital interfaces, upgraded internet connections so that they can do it virtually.

1799
02:35:04,900 --> 02:35:12,420
And if you watch some anime on Crunchyroll, Netflix, Funimation, high dive between I'd say

1800
02:35:13,620 --> 02:35:23,220
late 2000, late 2022, like 2021, you know, last 18 months or so, you probably couldn't tell.

1801
02:35:23,220 --> 02:35:27,540
You really couldn't tell that it was being done at home. But now that because restrictions have

1802
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:31,940
been lifted and so forth and various companies owning certain companies, it's like,

1803
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:34,660
well, we're not doing that remote anymore. You're going to have to come in.

1804
02:35:37,140 --> 02:35:40,980
The breaking news just won't stop. I didn't realize this happened until I think you or

1805
02:35:40,980 --> 02:35:45,220
somebody in chat said something about it. But, you know, we were talking about Kamiya and how

1806
02:35:45,220 --> 02:35:49,780
he basically was blocking everyone on Twitter. Twitter ended up restricting him. He deleted his

1807
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:56,340
Twitter during tonight's show. As of two hours ago, he reactivated. So he's written a few tweets

1808
02:35:56,340 --> 02:36:00,820
since then. The first one he wrote says or translates to resurrection with a, you know,

1809
02:36:00,820 --> 02:36:05,780
little 8-bit graphic of a Phoenix. Then he writes, Good morning, everyone. It's still

1810
02:36:05,780 --> 02:36:10,180
Parasite Shimada mode. So he's basically saying, I'll still block you, bitch, is what I'm reading

1811
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:22,020
out of that. Kamiya is very, yeah. Again, it's, yeah. He says, I've seen people repeatedly delete

1812
02:36:22,020 --> 02:36:26,420
and reactivate their accounts for some time. But after actually doing it, I feel like I

1813
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:29,860
understand a little more. It's a sense of liberation, isn't it? And look at this,

1814
02:36:29,860 --> 02:36:34,580
the first reply, bah, maybe you should delete your account again or pay your voice actors.

1815
02:36:34,580 --> 02:36:39,700
Jennifer Hale got paid. That's what's happening. Everybody's taking

1816
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:43,220
hell on his side and attacking without hearing the other side. This goes back to what I said

1817
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:51,780
about the four sides. Yeah. I'm just seeing if there's anything else kind of, uh, don't

1818
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:57,540
tweet me. I don't care. He should, he should turn off his replies. He should just turn that

1819
02:36:57,540 --> 02:36:59,780
off so people can actually message him. Maybe you should get someone on people

1820
02:36:59,780 --> 02:37:03,060
tweeting back at him. I don't know. I guess. I don't know. Just don't check your notifications,

1821
02:37:03,060 --> 02:37:07,540
dude. I don't know. Anyway, I'm not, again, and I want to make sure this is clear from the beginning

1822
02:37:07,540 --> 02:37:11,540
because I don't want people to be like, Rob Roberts said on OLR, he was taking Platinum Games

1823
02:37:11,540 --> 02:37:19,540
side. No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that there, I'm saying that what Helena is claiming

1824
02:37:19,540 --> 02:37:25,060
is not instantly the truth. And that I think she was pretty shady. And some of the things she said

1825
02:37:25,060 --> 02:37:29,700
that clue me into the fact that there is more going on. And again, there are more sides to

1826
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:35,140
the story than what Helena is saying that I will own, you know, and some people are saying that

1827
02:37:35,700 --> 02:37:44,980
she did on this under duress, anger, and I get that. I, but I also feel if I put out a video

1828
02:37:44,980 --> 02:37:52,100
like that, just throwing everybody under the bus and casually spilling news of a spinoff game.

1829
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:57,060
Yeah. I think like sometime late, I would do a follow up apologizing for my actions

1830
02:37:57,060 --> 02:38:00,100
and telling people that I was upset or something like that. I didn't see that.

1831
02:38:00,900 --> 02:38:07,700
No, I haven't seen that. And for, and I will add for some, and some people have said,

1832
02:38:08,260 --> 02:38:13,140
$4,000 is a lot of money for very little work. She should be thankful.

1833
02:38:13,140 --> 02:38:15,620
Okay. Voice acting is a lot of work.

1834
02:38:15,620 --> 02:38:22,580
Yes. Oh yeah. Again, that may be the base pay. And you may, I'm just saying you could be

1835
02:38:23,700 --> 02:38:31,060
the most pain in the ass voice actor out there, but regardless of how much of an asshole you are,

1836
02:38:31,060 --> 02:38:35,380
if you are, if you had that type of a demand for your voice and everything,

1837
02:38:35,380 --> 02:38:39,380
you're going to get more than the base money. I can tell you that right now.

1838
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:46,100
Yeah. The other thing that I wanted to say, I don't remember if you said it or someone in

1839
02:38:46,100 --> 02:38:50,740
chat said it, but basically the fact that she's not going to be working with platinum games ever

1840
02:38:50,740 --> 02:38:57,380
again. I get, if she, if she broke NDA here. She burned those bridges.

1841
02:38:57,380 --> 02:39:00,500
She didn't just burn a bridge with platinum games. She's not going to work in, she's not going to

1842
02:39:00,500 --> 02:39:05,460
work in this industry again. You remember earlier how you said about voice actors are a bit of a

1843
02:39:05,460 --> 02:39:10,740
tight knit community. Yeah. I could tell you that. Is Jennifer fucking Hale the bridge you

1844
02:39:10,740 --> 02:39:20,420
want to burn right now, girl? I mean, she's such a sweet person. I mean, Jennifer is not,

1845
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:27,140
not the sort of bitch. All right. Um, Rama, any quick final thoughts before we wrap up?

1846
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:33,300
Oh, oh, oh, no, that, that, that's it. That's it. Have a good one. It's always great to hear from

1847
02:39:33,300 --> 02:39:37,220
you. And I encourage everyone to check out anime jam session, uh, where I, this story

1848
02:39:37,220 --> 02:39:41,300
will probably come up over there because it voice actor kind of crosses lines a little bit.

1849
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:47,620
Actually, no. Uh, this week we're talking about the convention we just came back from,

1850
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:52,900
which is why I'm wearing my, uh, sailor Venus soccer Jersey. Um, we just came back from a con

1851
02:39:52,900 --> 02:39:59,380
called AAC, another anime convention. Good, clever name. All right. Well,

1852
02:39:59,380 --> 02:40:03,540
we'll tune in for that on Tuesday. Uh, always appreciate hearing from you. Rama, uh, take care.

1853
02:40:03,540 --> 02:40:06,660
Have a great one. Okay. You too. You all take care of yourselves and each other. All right.

1854
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:12,100
All right. Well, with that, we're going to wrap things up here. We're almost, uh,

1855
02:40:12,100 --> 02:40:15,140
well, two hour, 45 minutes, but still we've been on the air for a little bit. So

1856
02:40:15,140 --> 02:40:19,940
we're going to wrap up here and, uh, get on out of here for the night. Thank you all for being here,

1857
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:24,100
especially after week break last week. Really appreciate that. Um, we're going to go around

1858
02:40:24,100 --> 02:40:27,940
and get our base final thoughts. I do want to thank you all for being here as I do every week.

1859
02:40:27,940 --> 02:40:31,620
Thank you for being here. If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, tell a friend or two about the

1860
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:35,620
show. Help us spread the word. Um, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

1861
02:40:35,620 --> 02:40:39,700
but we need more voices here so we can get some voices on air and so forth. Uh,

1862
02:40:41,060 --> 02:40:46,500
everything goes a long way. Word of mouth reviews, five star reviews, shout outs, uh,

1863
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:50,340
and all that good stuff. Raids. Uh, we really appreciate that. So thank you. Thank you. Thank

1864
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:56,020
you. Um, let's, uh, let's wrap it on up. Um, you are streaming tonight, right? Dark soccer,

1865
02:40:56,020 --> 02:41:01,380
even with the voice issues, right? Okay. I, I am. Um, uh, I'll, I won't be talking much.

1866
02:41:01,380 --> 02:41:06,180
Um, but I plan on doing this in Debbie tonight. The Halloween event's still going on. I've got

1867
02:41:06,180 --> 02:41:11,780
all the stuff unlocked though. Oh, good, good. I still need to earn it. I would come play with you,

1868
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:16,580
but I'm, I'm a day behind. I'm micromanaging my island 14. So that's probably where I'll be after

1869
02:41:16,580 --> 02:41:22,580
the show after publishing the show, which takes time too. So I can't, uh, intoxicated,

1870
02:41:22,580 --> 02:41:28,580
said he might play with me and Gwen. So reach out. Okay, cool. All right. Uh, any last thoughts

1871
02:41:28,580 --> 02:41:35,300
before we, uh, say goodnight? Oh, I need to go visit a sea witch about getting my voice back.

1872
02:41:36,580 --> 02:41:42,340
All right. Good luck with that. Bye. Later taters. I hope that sea witch is a drag queen

1873
02:41:42,340 --> 02:41:51,140
and not Melissa McCarthy. Just saying. All right. Bye. All right. Uh, Loki, your final thought

1874
02:41:51,140 --> 02:41:59,220
tonight? Um, hoping to get to play, um, return the monkey Island this week. Maybe a little bit,

1875
02:41:59,220 --> 02:42:05,780
at least. Yeah. Check that out. It'd be fun. Uh, my final thought is, um, being a cheap plug for

1876
02:42:05,780 --> 02:42:10,580
my personal stream, uh, at Rob Roberts here on Twitch. Uh, I will be playing no man's sky

1877
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:14,980
tomorrow, uh, continuing on in Bobby Black Wolf mode. We're going to build some more base. We're

1878
02:42:14,980 --> 02:42:18,500
going to hopefully explore some things we haven't been able to get to before because the game can

1879
02:42:18,500 --> 02:42:22,660
move a lot faster now that you don't have to grind as much. So I'm really excited about that.

1880
02:42:22,660 --> 02:42:28,100
And, um, let's see. Uh, I also, on Wednesday, I'll probably be playing some overwatch too.

1881
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:32,100
I'm going to try to co-stream that with husband. Um, if I can't do that on Wednesday, then, um,

1882
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:36,580
you know, do something. So, uh, just a cheap plug for my personal channel. Thank you so much. Oh,

1883
02:42:36,580 --> 02:42:42,500
and also, also just on a like personal local note, um, I got to host that show last night with, um,

1884
02:42:42,500 --> 02:42:45,780
the screen queen score less the burlesque variety troop that I work with. And we had

1885
02:42:45,780 --> 02:42:51,620
the Boulay brothers, um, who host a Dracula as our headliners, um, and featured, and, um,

1886
02:42:51,620 --> 02:42:56,420
a lot of just kind words after the show that made me feel really good about my hosting ability and

1887
02:42:56,420 --> 02:43:00,500
like what I'm doing and so forth. So I just, I just want to say like, I really have felt that

1888
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:06,020
love yesterday and on into it's, it's made me in a really good mood today, especially with, um, as,

1889
02:43:06,020 --> 02:43:10,260
uh, Rama called it the pandemic really, uh, weighing heavily on our minds the past two

1890
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:13,860
years. Like it just feels really, really good to have done something like that.

1891
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:18,180
So like, I'm just in a, in a really good place right now. So I just appreciate that. So,

1892
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:23,540
all right. Well, I think that's it. That's all they wrote. We're done. Let's get on out of here

1893
02:43:23,540 --> 02:43:27,140
for the night. Have a good one, everybody. We'll see you next week, uh, here on orange

1894
02:43:27,140 --> 02:43:32,260
lounge radio, happy gaming, be nice to each other. And for the love of God,

1895
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:38,340
learn to critically think good night, everyone. You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
