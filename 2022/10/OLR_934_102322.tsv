0	16000	prepare to file more Joy-Con drift warranty replacements, break out your free Nintendo gloves, and get ready to play Mario Party 1 again!
16000	20000	I have vivid memories of wrecking both my palm and analog sticks playing Mario Party 1's minigames.
20000	24000	Once GoldenEye is available too, we're going to be gaming like it's 1999.
24000	27000	Maybe it's a good thing I haven't managed to buy Nintendo 64 controllers for the Switch yet.
27000	29000	This is my rose-tinted glasses story.
29000	34000	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34000	36000	Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
39000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46000	55000	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 934 of our program for tonight.
55000	68000	October the 23rd of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am here every week to talk about the latest and greatest, greatest, greatest, greatest, greatest games with my co-hosts.
68000	74000	Although clearly I trip over my own words quite frequently. Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
74000	75000	Hi.
75000	77000	Hello, hello. How are you?
77000	84000	I'm dealing with stuff. Still fighting a losing battle with my voice.
84000	95000	Yeah, my voice is in a weird place too. I feel like I might have caught a cold when I hosted that show, but like it's certainly not the big one because I've had that more than enough times at this point.
95000	102000	So yeah, I just feel like a little sinacy. I don't know how to put it, but my voice still doesn't feel 100% tonight, which is weird.
103000	117000	I've been dealing with this since TwitchCon and then before that when I had that bad cough, my voice was going and I'm wondering if I haven't done some kind of long term damage.
117000	118000	Oh yikes, I hope not.
119000	135000	Yeah, this is about as much voices as I've had now for the last couple of days and it wears off pretty, pretty quickly. So I'm, I'm working with my doctor on it. I think it's that I've missed work and I'm out of sick time.
135000	153000	So I mean, I'm on I'm on a temporary leave, which means I'm protected. But at the same time, I'm not getting paid. So I'm gonna talk to my doctor and see if this gets me on like some type of short term disability or something until we figure out what's going on.
153000	163000	Fair enough. Go to our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific over at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network or VOG network.
163000	174000	And you can catch us right after the Bobby Blackwell show on Sunday nights and chat along with our program where Jessiks is saying grapes equals wine, making a play on what when I said the grape is earlier.
175000	195000	Pod culture says, man, Rob must have been drinking before the show. Not tonight, oddly enough. No, I know my shirt is grape colored tonight. But no, I am I'm surfeitly pober tonight. And I yeah, I don't know what to blame, but myself. You know, I'm new at this actually. I'm new to Twitch actually and streaming. This is our first
196000	207000	Twitch. Yeah, this is our first, you know, podcast. So please be actually I can't say that. This is the first podcast I've ever done. It's just still going all these years later.
208000	211000	Technically, but not the first show you've done.
211000	222000	No, not the first show I've done, but the first podcast. Yeah. All right. Also say hello, of course, to someone who I think it's his first podcast as well. Say hello to tech master or should I say Minecraft master Loki.
223000	225000	Hello, I'm getting title changes today.
225000	229000	Maybe I don't know why not. I'm messing everything else up. Why don't I change up titles to
230000	232000	You've you've you've evolved.
232000	238000	That's true. Well, let me ask this. I know we're not into the gaming weeks yet. But did you play anything but Minecraft this week?
240000	241000	No.
241000	243000	So is my title incorrect?
244000	245000	It is correct.
245000	254000	Well, I know a game you must be thinking about playing is Silent Hill 2. I see that playing in the background there. So I wonder what could be influencing that pick tonight.
254000	259000	I couldn't think of anything to put in there except for, you know, Silent Hill, I guess.
259000	260000	Yeah, no, I mean,
260000	264000	it was, you know what I was hovering over before I picked Silent Hill 2?
264000	265000	What's that?
265000	266000	Yaris.
266000	274000	Oh, okay. Well, yeah, didn't that didn't wasn't there something about like that just hit its anniversary of some sort? Was it like the 10 year anniversary or something in that game just recently?
274000	275000	I don't know.
275000	280000	It was recently in the media again recently. I don't remember why. But I mean, you would think most people forgot about Yaris.
280000	283000	We have to remember our mistakes so that we don't repeat.
283000	286000	Why do you keep reminding me that it existed?
287000	292000	I think I think it's the internet reminding us that Yaris is now eligible to be a classic game of the week, I think.
293000	305000	All right. Let's get into Okay, so we brought up Silent Hill 2. Let's get into some of the big news from this week. You know, we talked about it last week because we knew there was an announcement of an announcement coming.
305000	309000	But this week, we actually got the announcements when it comes to Silent Hill.
309000	312000	Dark Soccer, I know this is a series you're a fan of as well.
312000	319000	Tell us a little bit about the Silent Hill direct or transmission or the heck they called it was a direct Come on.
319000	326000	Oh, Lord, there's a lot of stuff that came out with Silent Hill and to go ahead and start with it.
326000	329000	I want to talk about the movie.
329000	337000	They've got Christoph Ganz coming back to do a direct sequel based off of Silent Hill 2.
337000	344000	You know, I guess with some updates here and there because there is some pretty dated content in the original game.
344000	356000	But I like the quote on here that Ganz said the film tells the story of young guy coming back to Silent Hill where he has known a great love and what he's going to find is a pure nightmare.
356000	360000	And of course, we'll see the Red Pyramid.
360000	365000	I like how he says I was talking about the Red Pyramid thing, you know, the guy with the helmet.
365000	367000	That's actually cute.
367000	379000	So now I know that the other sequel was based on Silent Hill 3 and I liked it for what it was.
379000	382000	But it wasn't great.
382000	392000	I would like to see an actual Silent Hill 3 retelling in the order that they're doing like this is going to be an official Silent Hill 2 movie.
392000	397000	I want an official Silent Hill 3 movie, you know, that type of thing.
397000	400000	So also going up there's Bloober.
400000	403000	What a silly name.
403000	416000	But they're doing a Silent Hill 2 remake is a timed PS5 console exclusive, and I don't know what I what I think about it.
416000	418000	PC.
418000	426000	Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty, but I mean, I'm trying to get a better look at James's face.
426000	432000	I mean, it looks like it could be really, really good, but I'm not a fan of Bloober's track record.
432000	435000	You know, they made James kind of hot.
435000	437000	Like they gave him a new voice.
437000	440000	It's pretty, but it's no enhanced edition.
440000	444000	I mean, sheer quality that was.
445000	451000	I was trying to play a little bit of the trailer here for those watching on Twitch, and I actually accidentally got audio coming through.
451000	453000	Sorry about that.
453000	455000	He does look really good, I have to say.
455000	462000	But the what I'm most impressed with is the level of expression on his face.
462000	471000	Like he actually looks like he's feeling like actual pain and confusion.
471000	475000	And, you know, and also Red Pyramid looks really good.
475000	478000	But I wonder if he has a tongue.
478000	481000	That's a really good point about the expression.
481000	486000	You know, I didn't even really think about that when I was kind of joking, because, you know, Shane and I were texting about this all week.
486000	490000	And he didn't agree with me that I was like, James got hot.
491000	493000	He did agree with me, but it didn't pick either.
493000	498000	He's very particular, aren't we all a little bit, but it didn't occur to me.
498000	505000	But when you said that, I'm like, Oh, I think you're right on the money with that is that by kind of doing a recapture of him.
505000	508000	So just why they probably don't even have the code for the original game or whatever.
508000	510000	They probably have motion captured now anyway.
510000	512000	But to do that, you're right.
512000	517000	Like Jamie, when she says you're capturing the emotion because some of these scenes, especially like the mirror scene.
517000	521000	And you know, some of the scenes near the end without giving anything away are very emotional.
521000	528000	And the fact that they can like capture that in the face in a way that Silent Hill 2, you know, the PS2 couldn't do the same way.
528000	530000	Like, I think that's going to be huge for this game.
530000	532000	That's a really good point you bring up.
533000	538000	Well, funny, though, when you started saying that it was right after I made the tongue comment.
539000	541000	Because we all know about Pyramid Head's tongue, right?
542000	544000	Yeah. So I'm I'm curious.
545000	548000	Well, then it was supposed to come out of this little hole in the thing.
549000	551000	Side note, going to Dead by Daylight.
552000	559000	On Pyramid Head's model in Dead by Daylight, that part of his helmet has been bolted down, but the tongue is rendered.
560000	561000	Interesting.
562000	565000	Yeah. Anyway, that's it for Silent Hill slash Dead by Daylight trivia.
566000	573000	There's also Silent Hill Ascension, which is a choose your own adventure sort of streaming series.
574000	580000	Hmm. So, well, you want to bring it back to DBD? I believe behavior is involved with that one.
580000	582000	Yes, behavior is involved with it.
582000	586000	But nothing to do with the four versus one game. It's just coincidence.
587000	598000	It's interactive. I wonder if it's going to be like some AR thing or if it's going to be like a group vote to see what happens next or
598000	602000	it says audience members can work together to impact the story at every turn.
603000	606000	So I wonder if it's going to be like a big, like massive voting thing.
607000	615000	Yeah, I it seems like a very ambitious thing because a part of me is kind of like, well, is it like a until dawn type of approach?
616000	622000	You know, where like you pick things in it, but it with the live chat, it really seemed like, oh, they're doing but I don't know, it would seem kind of
623000	634000	I don't want to say I don't want to use a lot of negative words. But like, I'm not sure I like the idea of just like the internet votes and we do that thing. Is that really innovative?
634000	637000	Like I wonder if there's a more to it.
637000	641000	I wonder if it isn't now you know, it would be innovative.
642000	650000	If that chat is like you the Twitch streamers Twitch chat influences your story and what's happening. That's a little more innovative to me.
650000	655000	But we I mean, the reality is we don't know we did the same thing with the quarry. Yeah, yeah.
656000	661000	A lot of streamers did. Yeah, that's true. That's true. So we don't know a lot right now, but it looks interesting.
664000	672000	I think it's gonna be be pretty neat. If you want to give your comments on the next feature.
673000	692000	Sure. Let's talk a little bit about Silent Hill F. So I don't know if y'all saw the trailer, let me put it up on the other screen. But so there's another Silent Hill that's going to be coming another game that they announced and it really, it doesn't have anything to do with the other games. So it's not like a remake or, you know, spin off or any of that, but it's, it's a whole new story.
692000	714000	And instead of being set in a, you know, Centralia, Pennsylvania type of town or whatever, it's it's actually Japan in the 1960s. And, you know, in the trailer, we don't see Pyramid Head, but we see like the, you know, kind of something's wrong with her scary schoolgirl carrying like an iron pipe or something.
714000	733000	And then you see this very interesting, like floral character towards the end of the video and her face falls off and it's very scary. So I gotta say I, I liked artistically where this was going. I have no idea what the F the game is. That's, that's maybe why they call it Silent Hill F because we don't know what the F the game is.
733360	737200	I liked when the announcement was in the stream. Everyone was like F's in chat.
737200	766680	Well, and then my other joke was I sure hope they put out an art box for Silent Hill F, the Silent Hill F art box, but we'll see. Alright, anyway, now that I've shown that I'm 12 years old. Anyhow, yeah, Silent Hill F, we don't know when it's coming out. But we do know some of the names that are associated with this, even if you don't know who they necessarily are, because a lot of streamers when they saw that the writer of the game was Ryukishi07 were like, Who? Who's that?
767360	796800	Well, you know, you probably may not know who Ryukishi07 is over here. But they did works on series such as When They Cry, Higurashi When, When They Cry, Umoniko When They Cry. And then I guess Higurashi is like a cult following of sorts has one of those online. So they're like a known like visual novel kind of artist, at least in Japan. And so I'm assuming maybe those you on the convention circuit and those that follow the Japanese culture and media a little
796800	816200	closer than than I do necessarily probably recognize the name. And then the creature and character design is by Kira in the trailer. So it is kind of interesting that it does seem to be some new names and some new blood pun intended into the Silent Hill franchise. But part of what makes me happy about the Silent Hill
816200	838320	Direct, like, number one, the whole thing had a low bar to begin with. Let's be real. So the fact that yes, Konami has given Silent Hill 2 to Bloober. They gave Silent Hill F to another studio. It's not being made internally. Who is making this one? Darn it. I forgot the name. But it was they I think they did like, the resident
838320	868080	code something. Yeah, they did. No code. It was no code. Yeah, they did the spin off games Resident Evil, the multiplayer stuff. So they haven't done like huge profile things. But I think that's interesting. And then we had of course, you know, we talked about that the one dark soccer just talked about was, you know, behavior entertainments evolved there. There's another one we didn't get into Silent Hill transmission. I think it was called the one that Annapurna is publishing that the developers of Oh, God, what was that scary horror game with the computer had like the 80s
868080	897920	graphics. I need to look in chat because you guys are going to know this. Yeah, Annapurna is more like a publisher. And Rama. So Rama who does follow Japanese culture a lot closely, mentioning that Oh, this is the person behind Higurashi. Rama says in chat, you are in for a tweet, especially if you like mind fucks. Well, you know, Silent Hill fans, they tend to like mind fucks. So this is gonna be pretty fucking good. It sounds like Thank you
897920	927880	Mike Deaf to remember the name of the game Stories Untold. So it's by the developer of Stories Untold is doing the transmission game. So yeah, this is what I wanted. I wanted Konami to take one of their big IPS and say, you know what, we don't know how to make games anymore. So we're gonna bring in outside talent to make games. And that's great. Honestly, this makes me excited for a Castlevania Direct, to be quite honest. I hope there's big things in store for that franchise next.
927920	947480	Now, was I completely like bouncing off the walls and ceilings at what I saw? No, because in all of these previews, we didn't see a single lick of gameplay in any of them. None of them showed gameplay, not even Silent Hill 2 showed gameplay. I mean, that's probably
947480	953200	Well, it's sort of, they sort of kind of showed what it would look like, because it's gonna be different camera.
953240	956840	It was in engine, but we don't know for sure. But,
956880	959200	Right. Yeah, but Akira Yamaoka.
959480	960280	Yeah, no.
960280	961120	Doing new music.
961520	977440	There's a lot of things to be very happy about. And I'm feeling a lot more positive about this than I was going into it. I don't want to make big proclamations that are too, too big, bigger, bigger than I trust Konami to fill into.
977720	992240	But I hope with as much bullshit. Well, I shouldn't use that word because it's all been deserved. So with as much shit as Konami has rightfully gotten online in the past few years for the direction their company has taken in many directions.
992560	1002680	I hope this is a sign that someone at the top finally heard the fucking message. And this is the start of a new creative direction for Konami.
1002680	1023920	I really, really hope again, I feel like I'm putting big pants out there that I'm not sure these business folks at Konami really know how to fill but I'm gonna hope I'm gonna wish thoughts and prayers that this is the beginning of a bold for them new creative direction for Konami and that would be that would make me very happy.
1024840	1048760	By the way, that what I'm saying that completely set because I know some of you will be like, but the arcade games are doing fine and DDR is great and sound voltage. I please a reminder. Konami's arcade division, which is the same as the slot machines that the pachinko's they're doing just fine. So all of that I'm not touching I'm talking about Konami home entertainment, who's doing the console games.
1048760	1075800	Yo, case set is gone, girl. They're gone. So you know, they shut all those offices down. So if this is the start of a new creative direction for Konami's and how they they plan to approach home entertainment. I'm very excited. So Questbuster in chat says I'd rather have Konami ask others to do something with their Titanic library of IP than wait for them to do it themselves. Yes to that.
1076560	1105680	Dark Tetsuya says yeah, I get you the criticism is towards the home division, whatever's less left of that. Yes, very much that part. Honestly, honest to God. Let's all be thankful. There was no mobile game announcement in this direct. There was no NFT game announcement in this direct. There was a you know, there's there's a lot of things to celebrate in this. So so let's let's take a moment to give let's get let's all take a moment to give some polite golf claps to
1105680	1121760	Konami for this silent is it being picked up by polite golf claps to Konami for this potentially creative new direction. And let's hope the games don't suck. But I you know what, out of all of them, one of them's got to be good.
1121760	1150000	Right? Yeah, I mean, and it's, they've kind of tried with like other game with their franchises already. They've tried several times have failed. So I'm hopeful that multiple different studios are going to be able to, you know, do this. I was sad to see I understand the reasoning because you know, they're never going to apologize. But sad to see though, that we still don't get a Kojima game, but it's fine.
1150480	1179640	Well, you know, on one hand, I think it could be very interesting for Kojima to have a Microsoft game. Because that appears to be the direction it's going in with the whole cloud and whatever it is he wanted to do with Stadia. But Stadia decided we'd rather make bad business decisions all day. So despite the fact that we have some pretty good technology, we're just gonna like make really bad decisions on how to use it. And so now Kojima is going to x cloud, I guess the second suitor. And
1179640	1209400	what you know, the runner up and doing his game there. I think that could be very interesting to have, you know, whatever scary, assumably thing he's doing there with the cloud, sort of to compete with the exclusiveness of Silent Hill two on PlayStation five. It just, I think I just, as a fan of all of the gaming companies, I'm glad that Microsoft is getting some serious, like, Japanese credit with having Kojima working with them, I think could be very interesting for the future.
1209400	1232040	What Xbox looks like. So we'll see. Yeah. All right, dark to see it says we are in the market for a series s. So we should be prepared for whatever Kojima is cooking up lol. And we again, we're assuming that that game is going to be exclusive. But if it's true that it leverages cloud technology, maybe in a way that Sony isn't quite set up to do yet, then yeah, I think it's probably it's gonna be a
1232040	1236000	a Microsoft, Microsoft now.
1236960	1242720	I love that PlayStation now. It's cutting edge PlayStation one technology.
1242760	1252920	I keep saying Xbox exclusive, but let's be real like Microsoft, a game pass for PC is a very real thing. And I believe whatever is put out will be a Microsoft exclusive, I think is a better way to put it.
1253120	1262680	Exactly. In the in the end, these console wars, you know what know the true winners are PC players. Because it's just like, I get everything. It's all good.
1263440	1292600	Having just bought this new PC, I'm eating so good these last few months when it comes to gaming. Like I, I don't even know right now if I need to get a PlayStation five, I'm gonna get what Alan and I were just talking about this yesterday. Because we were at Target. And I sort of, here's, here's the question Alan asked. So you know what he's thinking about? He said, Hey, what happened to the talk of you getting a PlayStation five? Is that like a holiday thing that you're going to try to do? So you know, you get which is very sweet that Alan's thinking about
1292600	1322480	that. But I'm like, well, I've sort of been holding off to see if they do a refresh. And I also am really holding off to see what happens when Final Fantasy 16 comes out. Because if they're going to do like a limited edition PlayStation five with like a Final Fantasy 16 controller or a Final Fantasy 16, you know, box or something like, I fucking want that I want that, like, and I'll, I'll have Shane get it for me. Because if anyone can win those fucking limited inventory games, it's him. And I'll be like, Shane, please, please, please, he'll do it. Because once
1322520	1336480	when he wants to be nice, he's nice. So he'll get me one of those. That's, that's where I want to go. By the way, didn't make our show world tonight. But since I brought it up, there was a new Final Fantasy 16 trailer this week. Did any of you see the new Final Fantasy 16 trailer?
1336880	1337160	Nope.
1337280	1338680	I read a bit about it.
1338760	1359040	Oh, it looks so good. Looks so I'm so like, now here, here's where I'm setting the bar too high is Final Fantasy 16. But it's so what, in my opinion, one of the best parts of Final Fantasy 14 was when you had a summon or you know that basically there's a part in the Heavens
1359040	1388960	Word content, I won't give you the context. So let's tell you what happens. Shiva, who you all know, is an infamous Final Fantasy summon, fights Ravana, who's one of the unique summons, basically, that was built for the Final Fantasy 14 universe, but he's really good. They fight each other. And Shiva in the storyline is actually has like a human for a host, or actually, I think she's technically an elf, but you know, just just put put high fantasy logic
1388960	1389600	into this. Okay.
1389640	1390360	Shenanigans.
1390400	1418360	Yeah. Shiva's in the body of what is otherwise, you know, a normal, you know, walker around the planet, so forth. So my point is, but she fights Ravana. It feels like they've made an entire game out of what was the coolest sequence in Final Fantasy 14 was those two summons fighting each other. So and it feels like you need to look at this new trailer, it's very much Oh, the summonings are living in people. And then they come out to fight each other. Like that seems to be where the story is going. But it's all Game of Thrones.
1418440	1434120	And very violent. Holy shit, like the newest trailer, like has a decapitated head like full. I mean, it's not it's cropped just enough where you don't see gore, but it's very clear what's happening. And it's like, you don't see this in a Final Fantasy game, usually. So
1434120	1436160	the tagline heads will roll.
1436200	1463880	Yeah, heads will roll Final Fantasy 16. So anyway, I'm very excited about that. Yeah. Why not? All the other headlines we're missing tonight. Mike Deft points out there's also new Pokemon Scarlet Violet news. Yes. I believe the media, the more mainstream media and the Pokemon influencers of the world because I know some streamers and some, you know, big Pokemon specific sites got to have like a one hour hands on with Gen nine and a lot of those impressions are
1463880	1492840	hitting the internet this week. What we're not seeing is what the third evolution of the starter forums look like. But we're getting some insight as to how the games actually were. I mean, there was there was no question I was gonna buy Gen nine. If they had come out and said it's literally just Gen eight with new Pokemon, I would have still bought it. You know why? Because I like Gen eight. So I'm all about it. I'm very excited. Yeah, there's this dude. Gosh, why don't we just why don't we just let chat pick all the news for us tonight? No, it's fine.
1493360	1522440	Bobby Black Wolf actually brings this up. And this was something I noticed too, speaking of Final Fantasy. Awesome games done quick, the game list has come out, not the full schedule, just the list of what games they're going to do. And guess what Final Fantasy 14 is going to be an awesome games done quick. How do you speed run an MMO? They are doing a very specific mode, they're doing something called Palace of the Dead, which is side content, I guess, for lack of a better term that you can do with one to four players.
1522440	1552400	But specifically, they are doing floors 171 to 180. These floors are actually harder than the floors that come after it. There's 200 floors, the whole thing, these are the hardest 10, you get through these, you're going to get through the rest of it. They're going to speed run solo machinist Palace Palace of the Dead 171 to 180. And it takes about an hour to go through. I'm not sure how long a speedrunner will take, maybe also an hour. But I think that's going to be very interesting. And I like the fact that they're going to spotlight a side mode in the game.
1552440	1582280	Essentially. So it's going to be very cool to see. So Bobby says the estimate is one hour. So yeah, that sounds about right. So very excited. Bobby also says no mouse keyboard only. I could, I could see how somebody is probably doing that, to be honest, like it is it harder? Yes. Is it impossible? No, it's not the same as like playing it blindfolded or something. But I mean, still kudos, just the fact they're going to get through that with a big audience watching. I don't want to undersell what this person is
1582280	1612200	doing. They're taking on a very big task, where a lot can go wrong, because there's a lot of randomly generated elements in that. So there's, you know, they're taking on a big thing. So I'm very excited to see it. Alright, let's talk about the things we took on this week in our gaming week. And we're going to talk a little bit about our gaming weeks. So Dark Soccer, usually I'd start with you and how was your gaming week, but I think you had some kind of like personal things about like what you're doing with your stream coming up and so forth you wanted to get into. Can you can you talk us
1612200	1612880	through some of that?
1614000	1635720	Yeah, there's a few things going on. So first and foremost, and I sent you a graphic for it. But I'm gonna start at the beginning, my mom went into the ER, I think I might have mentioned it last week. And they did a couple of cultures. She does have thrush as well as
1635720	1665540	multifocal pneumonia, meaning she's got different pockets of pneumonia in her lung, and her lungs are raw. But on top of that, they have to retest her for COVID because the culture that they that they took came back viral. So she is still in the hospital. And now the thing is, is that my mom lives on Social Security and a part time job. She has no insurance, she lives in Alabama. So you can
1665540	1694700	imagine how hard it's going to be for her after having just bought a house to make ends meet with the with a hospital bill like that. So I am, I've created a GoFundMe. And the link is on my Twitter at dark sakura. It's, I think it's my pinned post. But on top of that, on top of that, I'm running a momathon on
1694700	1714020	November 1, I'm going to be doing a 12 hour Dead by Daylight plus whatever stream, if I get tired of Debbie, although I still like to, you know, say that I can endure a full 12 hours of Dead by Daylight. But there's gonna be like some chatting and like watching some YouTube stuff,
1714020	1737140	we'll throw in some fun things. But I am going to be doing artwork as the grand prize for whoever donates the most individually, as well as offering up mini portraits. And I'll go outside of like Dead by Daylight, if you want like a portrait of like a character from the show or, or something, I'll figure it out.
1737420	1742180	And you did the pig artwork on your on the banner, right? Just to get a sense of what people
1742220	1743380	Oh, no, I didn't do that pig.
1743420	1744660	Oh, I thought you did. I'm sorry.
1744740	1749780	No, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I did this pig.
1750260	1760180	And for those Okay, so I'm sorry for those on the podcast feed. There's no way for me to explain a photo to you. But you can go to dark soccer's Twitter account at dark soccer, and I'm sure it's in her media tab somewhere.
1760340	1767140	Yeah, that that's actually official behavior artwork. So don't sue me behavior. I gotta pay for my mom.
1767740	1789820	I think they won't care. But yeah, they're big. But you have I do know I saw your artwork. Well, I saw it in person. But I also saw it on losing color stream who you know, if you don't know who that is, they are a very prolific Dead by Daylight streamer. They're very good at killer, specifically the nurse. And so you know, they're a twitch partner, and they they put that photograph, I think or sorry, I keep saying photograph, but like in the print, they put it
1789820	1794780	behind them on their stream. So you actually see that nurse. And that was you that did that. So it was pretty cool.
1795100	1819380	Yeah. And it was funny, like, a couple of times now when I've popped in to chat, like, I'll do like a raid every so often, you know, I tried to, to focus on smaller people, but I will also focus on my friends. And so I did a raid and and they're like, look at look at here's the picture again. And you know how that came about? He was on stream one day saying, Oh, what, you know, because he stopped using a green
1819380	1847700	screen and started like actually decorating the room. And they're saying, Oh, I would like I'd love to have some framed artwork. And I'm like, Wait a second, because I was looking for an excuse to get back into some of my drawing. I've got all those Copics over there. And I have and I had a frame. I actually had a frame to pack that I haven't used. This is like, why not? I'll make it a gift for one of my friends.
1848700	1874580	And I'm glad that I'm glad so glad he likes it so much. But yeah, I'll be doing something like that. A like a 12 by nine thing done in a Copic markers of whichever killer or survivor in your choice of cosmetic. Or, you know, if you're not a Debbie person, then talk to me, we'll, we'll, we'll figure something else out.
1874580	1904020	But I'm doing some many, many portraits as well as, as a gift, you know, not as a gift, but as a as a reward. And, you know, I'll change some stuff up. It doesn't have to be a shade of dead by daylight. But, but yeah, I am I'm definitely by the way, yeah, Copics are expensive, like they are super expensive.
1904580	1934540	And I have found very good deals on Copic markers. So that's how I've amassed my collection. But at any rate, I am doing a momathon at noon on November 1, to help raise money for my mother's medical bills. In other news, going back on the medical front. I'm sure all of y'all know my bestie, Finara. She was my college roommate.
1934940	1961100	I've known her for longer than some of you have been alive. She was the first person who came out to visit me when I moved to California. And yeah, you know, and she's she's been on hard times, but she and I have her permission to say so. So that's what I'm going into it. A few days ago, she was admitted to ICU because she she had been complaining of problems breathing.
1961940	1974740	And like she was going to come play, you know, dead by daylight with me and it would take her like a solid like 15 minutes to get from upstairs to her computer. And I was like, you sure you're okay. You don't have to play if you're feeling so crappy.
1974740	2004740	But it turned out she went in for a clot. It was either a heart or lung is what the immediate thought it was because, you know, heart issues can also cause respiratory distress. It turned out there was a like a clot near her heart. And so they, they they did a catheter, they got it out. She she finally told me she's able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, take care of her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know
2004740	2034740	do a few normal things. Now they moved her out of ICU. She is in a regular room. She's doing better. The hospital apparently lost the charger that I spent 50 bucks sending to her because she needed a phone charger.
2034740	2040020	Being released in the next couple of days. So, and again, for those that don't know the name,
2040020	2044660	like oftentimes, you know, when when we're live here at OLR, we're rating you after the show, and
2044660	2049700	you're playing Dead by Daylight, and she's usually there with you also playing. Yeah, I can't really
2049700	2055540	play because I have to go edit the show and get that posted. But you know, she's kind of been your
2055540	2060660	sidekick in a lot of those adventures. So well, she started off as my meat shield. When I started
2060660	2066340	playing Survivor, and then, and now she's my accountant, because she keeps tracks of all of the
2066980	2070900	challenges that that I've done. She watches her own. She's like, I'll watch yours too. Why not?
2071940	2077380	She also used to like track my inventory in Animal Crossing. She just, she loves spreadsheets. Fair
2077380	2087060	enough. But I mean, I've, we played D&D together back in the day. We watched, we would watch
2087060	2099540	anime, like at home, but on like AOL chat, you know. And we, she, she ran my AOL, AOL Facebook
2099540	2105780	Animal Crossing group. Oh, yeah, I think still keeps up with it. And so I would just like for
2105780	2116260	everyone to send Gwen Finara some positive thoughts or whatever you do. You know, she's
2116260	2121700	got good doctors. She's getting better. She'll be going home before too long. But I wanted to bring
2121700	2127460	that up because she has also been a long time supporter of the show. She's been a long time
2127460	2135140	supporter of me and is one of my best friends in the world. I was really, really worried.
2135140	2140020	Well, definitely sending, you know, healing vibes and our thoughts, you know, for a quick turnaround.
2140020	2144020	I'm glad she's where she needs to be with the hospital and getting the care she needs and,
2144020	2151700	you know, hoping for a quick speedy recovery. Yeah, but, and I appreciate it. And I'll probably
2151700	2159860	say more on my deal. But back to my mom, Momathon, November 1st, starting at noon Pacific time,
2159860	2166020	going to midnight should be time for anyone to come in. And if you want to play with me,
2166740	2171540	my queue is open. I'm always looking for friends. I've reached out to a few people already who said
2171540	2180740	that they would play with me. So some kind of big names. Anything else in your gaming week?
2180740	2188820	Sorry, should pivot over there. I know, Dead by Daylight, Cult of the Lamb, Final Fantasy V. I'm
2188820	2195140	still playing that. I'm pretty, I'm enjoying it. It's been so long since I beat it that
2195860	2199140	it's kind of like being reintroduced to the game again.
2200020	2205700	Like, it's almost like the first time. It's pretty, pretty fun. And, you know,
2205700	2210100	I've been playing my wordscapes. Oh, I had another encounter, speaking of games.
2210660	2215380	And that's with Boosteroid. Because, you know, I've been working, I've been using Boosteroid
2215380	2224820	as my replacement for Stadia so I can play Dead by Daylight through Steam. And I had
2224820	2231300	this thing going on. When I play in Safari and I pull it up, it doesn't go full screen.
2231300	2237540	It keeps my window the way I had it. When I do it in Chrome, it forces it into full screen,
2237540	2243060	which makes it really difficult for me to like watch my chat at the same time as playing the
2243060	2249780	game, you know? I mean, unless I want to bust out my iPad, but I do other things, right? So
2250100	2259540	I can use Safari. It's just that it'd be easier for me to do my window capture on a different
2259540	2268900	window, you know? So I was working actually with one of their representatives. Actually, I just,
2268900	2273460	you know, put out a question to them anyway to get this from going full screen and actually had
2273460	2279940	a long chat with one of their representatives. I was actually a person that is, I think,
2279940	2285700	running their Twitter. And we went over everything and basically it's not possible,
2285700	2290740	but they stuck with me and had other suggestions and other ways to try to trick it into going.
2291380	2299780	And just that sort of support, like personal support like that. And they were so nice about it
2300580	2304580	that, you know, and I sent a screen recording and everything and they're like, oh,
2304580	2310660	we like screen recordings. And I also found out that they may be coming out with a Mac version
2310660	2317860	of their software, like because they've got a Windows download client and they were
2318500	2325300	saying that a Mac client is in production. Yeah. So I got permission to give that little tidbit
2325300	2331860	out. So yeah. But the experience was great. And I'd say if anyone's looking for an alternative to
2331860	2339300	something like GeForce Now, definitely look at Boostroid. Their service is like, we didn't get
2339300	2346340	the problem solved, but they stuck with me to try. And that is almost as, yeah, that's almost as much
2346340	2352900	as getting it done. And that's it. All right. Well, Loki, I know we joked earlier it was pretty
2352900	2356740	much Minecraft, but any new, any new videos to talk about or anything in your gaming week?
2357620	2364180	No, I'm still working on the next one. So designing stuff for it. It's probably gonna be
2364180	2369620	multiple farms. I'm hoping to be able to start introducing the robot masters into it. I just got
2369620	2376420	one of the new one, one of the new ones. They're finishing up the design on stuff. So hopefully
2376420	2382500	they'll be coming soon. I'm having multiples of that design done because both of them came out
2382500	2390740	really good. So hopefully get shirts or something. And then I didn't really have much else. I did
2390740	2397540	want to mention, though, I watched a charity stream today. So one of the largest SMPs out
2397540	2403780	there for Minecraft, Hermitcraft, probably, you know, the most popular S&P that's out there,
2403780	2409940	have been going for like 10 years or so. They just did their first ever charity livestream for
2409940	2419540	Gamers Outreach, as was headed up by Good Times with Scar, and they raised over $423,000 for them.
2419540	2429380	And basically Gamers Outreach is a charity that brings those like mobile gaming, not really kiosks,
2429380	2437700	they're kind of like, it's like a monitor and, and the gaming console kind of on a rollable cart
2437700	2443380	that they can have in hospitals for kids that are sick. And since Good Times with Scar, he's got a
2443380	2448740	lot of health issues. He's always in the hospital for different things. You know, they're hoping
2448740	2453940	with that, the money that they have raised, at least that'll be another hundred or so units that
2453940	2458260	they'll be able to put into different hospitals and stuff. So I thought that was really cool.
2458260	2463940	So yeah, it's cool. Yep. All right. That's all I had. Awesome. Let me tell you about my gaming
2463940	2468180	week. Unfortunately, the game I've been playing the most this week, I'm not allowed to talk to
2468180	2474580	you guys about I really wish I could tell you what I've been putting in the hours for. But the devil
2474580	2479700	will get me if I tell you. All I can say is that if I could talk about it, I would have a lot of
2479700	2484020	nice things to say about it and where it's at in its current state. So but that's that's all I can
2484020	2491380	say right now. So otherwise, the games I can talk about I'm laughing because bonds 006 in chat is
2491380	2500660	saying Rob's trash talking and Overwatch two is a hoot. And yeah, I did I did play some Overwatch
2500660	2506260	two on a stream a little bit. And I was trash talking a little bit but mostly myself because
2506260	2510980	I'm really bad at it. But it was it was it's fun to learn. And you know what, you got to start
2510980	2515780	somewhere. And yeah, so I've been I've been having more fun with that series and I haven't a long
2515780	2522420	time I think the the little reboot was very, very good for it. Let's see what else have I
2522420	2527940	been playing? I still play no man's sky even though the drop campaign is done. I actually
2527940	2530980	played a little bit off stream last night and I might stream it again tomorrow. I don't know I
2530980	2534580	haven't decided what games I'm going to stream next week. So I might do another no man's sky
2534580	2539380	stream just because I'm having fun with the casual mode in it like the relaxed mode is is really fun
2539380	2544580	and it just kind of like you get to play the game without those immediate pressures of having to
2544580	2550820	like do certain things and grind a lot for them. So that that's great. I want to keep playing that
2550820	2556500	and continuing in Final Fantasy 14, which did have a minor content patch this week, they added a new
2556500	2561060	thing called variant dungeons in it. There's lots of criterion dungeons, but I haven't gotten to do
2561060	2565380	those yet. But the variant dungeon was very interesting. So it's like basically a dungeon
2565380	2570580	that's very large. And there are 12 different ways to complete the dungeon. But it's up to you and
2570580	2574980	your party how you want to do it. But you can also run it by yourself if you want to just do it
2574980	2579620	through with one person you can. So I thought that was a neat little side thing to add to it and
2579620	2585380	certainly is a little more interesting than just running the same two experts over and over again
2585380	2590820	in roulette. I kind of wish they would fuse the ideas and just have these expert dungeons be very
2590820	2594740	large and have different paths like but maybe that's where things are going. I don't know. But I
2594740	2600100	appreciate having the more diverse content in the game. I still I'm still working on my island. I'm
2600100	2603860	almost done getting all the cosmetics on my island. But I'm really excited that there should
2603860	2608820	be more with the island sanctuary stuff coming soon as well. So yeah, been keeping busy a lot
2608820	2615380	with my gaming week. Very excited. So chocobo crossing. chocobo crossing. Yeah, a little bit.
2615380	2620820	I don't really. I don't really see it as animal crossing as much. I think that's a but farm sim
2620820	2625620	that whole thing very much that I mean, as much as they can do in an existing MMO, but it's I,
2626340	2630820	I love it. And the cosmetic rewards I got were pretty cool. Like the mounts are really cute. So
2631860	2637300	now they just put in a new beast tribe daily thing though. And I need to do those mounts as well. So
2637300	2642020	yeah, just lots of great stuff going on in Final Fantasy 14. I know there was a joke at the start
2642020	2648180	of the show. It's the little bumps we play when we're live. We don't usually play them on the
2648180	2653460	podcast feed. But tonight was a joke about the Prime Minister of Britain and how you know she
2653460	2658180	quit after six weeks. And it was video games that we've played longer than she was Prime Minister.
2658180	2663220	And I actually put to do it I put it I was like I know I've spent like in the last 10 years that
2663220	2667860	this game has existed. I've absolutely racked up more than like what would six weeks be in hours
2667860	2673780	to be something like 120 hours. Like I have easily put in more than six weeks. No God, that's only
2673780	2682180	six of these more like 700 1000 hours probably. But anyway, I did my playtime 151 days I've spent
2682180	2688900	in Final Fantasy 14 151 days of game time. That's a that's a lot. That's a lot. That's a lot.
2690020	2697140	So anyway. All right. Let's move on. That's it for our gaming weeks. Let's talk about some other
2697140	2702020	things that are going on in the news. We'll start with Loki Oh, dark Tetsuya says she was Prime
2702020	2707860	Minister for 1008 hours. That's dark soccer. How many hours do you have in dead by daylight?
2708260	2710020	You're muted on Discord. I see the icon.
2712660	2716420	Less than that. Less than that. Oh, I thought maybe actually, yeah, I haven't. I don't know
2716420	2720340	that I've hit that. I mean, I can find out. I thought you'd hit the 1000 hours maybe. But
2721220	2724740	that's funny. I actually should probably check. So if there's a video game out there,
2724740	2728980	you've played for more than 1000 and eight hours. Congrats. You played a video game longer than she
2728980	2734500	was Prime Minister. So all right. Moving on. Let's get into some gaming news for the week.
2734500	2742020	So Microsoft is reportedly laid off hundreds of employees from its workforce across several
2742020	2751140	different divisions. There were, of course, some some of the subsidiaries as well, including
2751140	2759940	studio alpha, the Xbox division, the Business Insider article suggests it's less than 1000.
2760180	2765700	Business Insider article suggests it's less than 1000, but it is still several hundred.
2766740	2771780	In the course, Microsoft spokesperson has said that like all companies, we evaluate our business
2771780	2776740	priorities on a regular basis and make structural adjustments accordingly. We will continue to
2776740	2784260	invest in the I don't even care. It's just corporate speak. No idea why. I mean,
2785220	2792740	I don't know, restructuring, I guess. But it does suck to see people out of work.
2792740	2798020	Yeah, this is always a bummer of stuff to report on. I mean, it was the entire organization.
2798020	2803140	Remember, Microsoft does a lot of things, right? Windows, heck, HoloLens and things like that,
2803140	2807220	that never really got, you know, the retail thing, even though, you know, they're still using it for
2807220	2813140	other things. But, you know, so these layoffs could come from other parts of the organization,
2813540	2818900	not just, you know, Xbox, but it does sound like we do know that some Xbox was impacted.
2818900	2823860	But do we know if that's a dozen people? Do we know if that's 100 people? We don't totally know.
2824500	2828260	Bobby Black over chat says they probably reprioritize for the next financial year
2828260	2831620	and scale their workforce accordingly. Yes. And honestly, like,
2832420	2836660	maybe there it's part planning for the Activision Blizzard merger, probably not this soon out,
2836660	2840340	to be honest, but let's be honest, because it's not like, yeah, it's not guaranteed.
2840820	2845460	It's still going to get tied up in courts. But if that merger goes through, there's absolutely
2845460	2849860	going to be redundancies and it's, you know, it's not going to be fun to report on, but that's just
2849860	2854500	what's going to happen. You know, but that could be things like legal and, you know, it may not be
2854500	2859620	necessarily, you know, development. Yeah. I mean, we can't have two Bobby Kotex. I mean,
2859620	2863540	someone's got to go. Well, I can tell you who needs to go in that situation. But anyway,
2864100	2870500	um, yeah. So, you know, Microsoft, um, I don't know if I would take this aside of anything.
2870500	2873780	I think people are reading into this, like, you know, you know, there's the people on Twitter
2873780	2881060	that are like, Oh, Xbox flop confirmed. And it's like, put the car in a lower gear. Let's
2881060	2885860	critically think something we forget to do on social media. Sometimes does this necessarily
2885860	2890980	mean the end is coming? No, this could just be, you know, the result of other things shifting
2890980	2897140	around and doom and gloom. Yeah. Doom and gloom. The doom and gloom is when a bunch of games start
2897140	2902340	getting canceled out of Microsoft. Yeah. Yeah. Let's put it this way. It could have been worse.
2902340	2906580	They could have waited another month or so. And then the articles will be saying, and they did
2906580	2912820	it right before Christmas. What are these people going to like? So, yeah. Well still, I hope those
2912820	2916900	that were affected can find work, you know, maybe just Microsoft, such a huge company. Sometimes
2916900	2920740	with these things, they apply for a job somewhere else in the company and are able to keep their
2920740	2925860	time in. So hopefully, there's a lot of that whole thing going on. We'll see. Or plan a
2925860	2931140	different company and eventually become Microsoft because you get bought. All right. Speaking of the
2931140	2935860	lack of ability to critically think, you know, I've got to talk about this. I actually believe
2935860	2939140	it or not. I don't want to talk about this because I feel like I've talked about it enough on social
2939140	2945620	media this week. However, it's important to talk about the other half of this story that we only
2945620	2951460	knew half of last week. And that is, yes, the bayonet of three. Voice actress, Helena Taylor,
2951460	2955540	and everything that she brought up to the internet and how the internet rallied around her.
2956340	2960100	What did I say on last week's show? I said, I'm going to take an unpopular opinion here.
2960100	2965620	I meant, you know what? I've been blocked on social media. I've been unfollowed on social media
2965620	2970020	because I dared to take an unpopular opinion against the mob. Then you know what? I even went
2970020	2974020	so far last week is to say, what did I say last week? I'll give you an exact quote of what I said.
2974580	2979540	Helena Taylor is lying by omission. Guess what news came out this week?
2982100	2984820	Helena Taylor, omitted some things in her story.
2987780	2993140	Now look, I'm not always right. I'm not, and I'll be the first, I like to be a humble person,
2993140	2998260	but like on this one, I knew it didn't add up. And there's a lot of you out there, to be fair,
2998260	3002020	this isn't just me. There's a lot of you out there that knew it didn't add up, but we talked
3002020	3008100	about it on the show. Jamie said something in that video. Something in that video struck me
3008100	3015060	as off, right? And that's what it is. So as it turns out, according to journalistic reports,
3015060	3019860	Helena Taylor omitted some things, which would be lying by omission.
3022260	3027300	What happened? So Bloomberg did a report and Bloomberg learned through several different
3027300	3031620	sources than platinum, two different sources than platinum, and some actual documents that they
3031780	3036980	can't share because of confidentiality reasons, that Helena Taylor was actually offered three
3036980	3042660	to four K per session for five, four hour sessions. So her actual paycheck that she
3042660	3047700	was offered was somewhere between 15 to 20,000 to reprise the role of Bayonetta.
3048580	3054020	In response to this, Helena Taylor said, I want a six figure sum and residuals for the game.
3054580	3061060	Now look, I'm not here to argue and say she didn't deserve that. I understand that voice
3061060	3067620	actors and actresses are probably underpaid in this. To be fair, a lot of the people that
3067620	3072980	develop the games are also underpaid. And we know it is the executives, the Bobby Kotick's of the
3072980	3080740	world that are grossly overpaid. So there is some balancing that needs to be done in the industry.
3080740	3086420	You know, was the part of Bayonetta when you consider that that series does not break through
3086420	3092180	for Nintendo in the way it's an Animal Crossing or a Mario, you know, Bayonetta is kind of,
3092180	3097540	you know, it's it's making money, but it's not making oodles and oodles of money, right? So could
3097540	3102340	she was she worth six figures in that particular scenario? No, that's that's an argument for
3102340	3108420	another time. Charles Martinet doesn't even get six figure salary. So what makes her think that
3108420	3112980	she's gonna get that? So she's allowed to ask for what she thinks she's worth. They told her no.
3112980	3117060	Here's the other thing. But they still they still wanted to have her in the game.
3117620	3121540	And they said, you know what, so they started to look for someone to replace her.
3121540	3127300	They hired Jennifer Hale, they offered Helena Taylor a cameo in the game, which if you go back
3127300	3133060	to last week's show about the story spoilers, apparently in the game, start to add up a lot
3133060	3139620	like why would she only get a ah, maybe there's some fire and smoke and fire to those story
3139620	3143540	spoiler scenarios, but I will I won't re recap those because I know not everybody maybe wants
3143540	3147780	to hear those even though clearly it's something that happens in the opening segments of the game.
3147780	3156180	It's not a thing for the end. So they offered Helena Taylor to do one session, a cameo in the
3156180	3162580	game. And she also turned that down. So at the end of the day, did they offer her $4,000 to do
3162580	3170660	voice acting for Bayonetta? Yes. Did she omit the other offer they gave her? Yes. And did she do
3170660	3175300	damage to not just her cause, but all the voice actors and actresses out there fighting for more
3175300	3181380	money the way she put this whole thing together? I think she did. And it sucks. Now, of course,
3182100	3188900	Dark Soccer, you said this last week, and boy, oh boy, is this true. Sometimes when people feel
3188900	3194340	a certain way, even when they don't have all the facts, they dig their heels in. They can't
3194340	3199860	possibly have been wrong about this. And sure enough, there's so many people out there that are
3199860	3205540	saying, well, Bloomberg didn't produce the receipts. Bloomberg didn't show us, Bloomberg
3205540	3212660	needs to show us the letters. No, they don't. No, they don't. That's the journalistic- They don't
3212660	3218820	owe us an explanation at all. In fact, actually, internet people, something you need to learn about
3218820	3225460	life, nobody owes you shit. You need to learn that lesson real quick, or you're going to be
3225460	3231140	very disappointed as you walk through this life. Nobody owes you shit, especially- And also,
3231780	3236980	not everything is about you. That's right. You need to stop digging your heels in,
3236980	3242340	because here's the- And this is what I will absolutely watch people do. They will cherry pick
3242340	3246980	what Bloomberg articles, because Jason Schreier, sorry if I'm mispronouncing his name,
3246980	3251140	he has a pretty good track record about getting these insider stories. He obviously has very good
3251140	3254820	relations with people that are in the industry, and he's worked hard to get some of these inside
3254820	3259460	sources. You are not allowed to cherry pick which Bloomberg stories you will pick at face value
3259460	3265380	and which one you will not. Also, in addition to this, other journalists, there was at least one
3265380	3270100	other journalist working for another video game site who was independently also doing this,
3270100	3275300	who said, I can independently confirm what Jason is reporting on. He beat me to it.
3276100	3283220	So, I'm sorry. No, you don't get to see the receipts. You take the word as you took her
3283220	3287780	word, or you just- You need to admit you're digging your heels in too much on this.
3291220	3297620	Steven Toledo confirmed it too. So, multiple people are confirming there was more to this
3298260	3308660	story than she is leading on, period. You were emotionally manipulated by this woman.
3310740	3315860	And I've been emotionally manipulated by content on the internet quite often,
3315860	3321780	and I need to recognize when that's happening to me. So, I think there's a lot of people,
3321780	3326100	and to be fair, I would say there's a lot of people that when this news came out from
3326180	3332580	Bloomberg, they said, oh shit, lesson learned. I probably should have waited to hear the whole
3332580	3338900	story before. Okay, cool. I can admit when I'm wrong too. Let's learn together. Let's do better
3338900	3347060	next time. But those of you that are still digging your heels in on this, wake up. Bobby says she
3347060	3350820	doesn't ever want to do voice acting again anyway. She wants to go back to the theater and not talk
3350820	3355300	about this anymore. Yes, that was her response to Bloomberg. Because she got called the fuck out.
3356100	3361300	She also like destroyed her reputation too. She threw voice actors under the bus because
3361300	3366020	voice acting isn't her bread and butter. That's what Gigi Ramos said. I want to read this thread
3366020	3372820	on Twitter because honestly, this journalist on Twitter, her name is Catherine Cross and her
3372820	3376900	Twitter name is Quine Moon. I hope I said that right. I'm sorry if I didn't. I've heard Catherine
3376900	3381300	Cross before. I know she's a pretty prolific games journalist. She wrote an article that I think is
3381380	3389460	great. And you can see this over at wire.com. And I think she summed this up 100%. I retweeted this
3389460	3393220	on my account over at Mr. Rob Roberts. And I apologize to Catherine because I am going to read
3393220	3398500	this word for word. But I'm giving full credit to Catherine on this because she hit the nail on the
3398500	3402020	head and I think everybody needs to hear it. And I'm noticing this thing has only been retweeted
3402020	3410340	17 times. That is not enough. So if I may, in the words of Catherine Cross, Quine Moon over on
3410340	3414980	Twitter, I wrote about the unfortunate Helena Taylor affair and how it exposes the risks of
3414980	3420660	social media's demand for immediacy. A worthy cause was damaged, a veteran voice actor harassed,
3420660	3425620	all because people were emotionally manipulated into retweeting before thinking. The fragility
3425620	3430260	of personality driven politics is nowhere more apparent than on social media. And the risk of
3430260	3434820	depending on one's person's sympathetic story to drive a campaign is that if they turn out to have
3434820	3440580	acted in bad faith, the entire campaign can collapse. Social media demands urgency from us,
3440580	3444340	share now, think later. It's bitten well-meaning people in the ass many times before and it'll do
3444340	3451460	so again. And the really aggravating thing in this case is that Taylor's misleading claims
3451460	3458580	prevented us from talking about the fact that the true figure, some $15,000, is still far less than
3458580	3463700	one would expect for the voice actor or actress of a title character of a major franchise.
3464420	3471540	Can we talk about that part for a minute? Absolutely. Yes. Both of those things can be true.
3472100	3477380	Helena Taylor could not have been, may not have been paid enough money for what she
3477380	3482980	brought to that franchise. And she did a really shitty thing in the way she brought that up to
3482980	3489300	the rest of the internet. Continuing on the thread from Catherine Cross, just two tweets left,
3489300	3494660	bear with me here, but it's important. But it's always hard to pivot from a hot and heavy
3494660	3500180	personality-focused campaign to one focused only on the structural issues. You can't just go,
3500180	3507140	well, nevertheless, you lose momentum, supporters, time, and the headlines. Taylor was supposed to be
3507780	3513940	I'm sorry, I don't know this word, synodoch for the wider struggles of voice actors.
3514820	3520180	Had she told the truth, not made her campaign needlessly personal, for example,
3520180	3526020	telling Hale she had no right to sign Bayonetta merch, not demanded a boycott, the focus could
3526020	3533300	have been on the issues. Oh my God, so much that part. Snaps and kudos to Catherine for that thread.
3534180	3541060	I read it because everybody needs to hear it. There was a cause in here worth fighting for.
3541060	3547540	She did more damage to it because she was threatened by being replaced. And now when
3547540	3553540	you see this whole thing coming together, now when you realize she was offered money,
3553540	3558900	she said, no, they went and got somebody else and offered her a cameo in good faith still,
3558900	3565140	she realized what was happening. She was easily replaced by somebody else.
3565780	3568180	And this could threaten because she doesn't, go ahead.
3568980	3570580	Possibly somebody better.
3571780	3577620	And possibly that, but also, yes, somebody with certainly a deeper resume and somebody that gets
3577620	3584660	invited to more conventions than she historically has been. She saw that she may not have a place
3584660	3590500	and she was threatened by that, but that does not give her the right to manipulate people into
3590500	3598900	boycotting a game that so many people worked on. Why didn't she go to Jennifer privately and say,
3599700	3604900	why did you do this? Why did this happen? Can we talk about how to make this better for the
3604900	3611460	other people in our industry privately? Because Jennifer's fought that fight since 2016,
3611460	3618740	if not sooner. There were so many ways she could have done this, not on Twitter, but she did the
3618740	3631460	crappy thing and it sucks. But here's the thing, how can you personally help this cause? And I
3631460	3637300	would like to offer a suggestion because remember, Ms. Hale and so many other voice actors and
3637300	3642020	actresses out there, they go around to conventions and I've gone to my share of gaming conventions
3642020	3645540	and I do conventions in other circuits as well. I've talked about horror hosting and I've been,
3645540	3650180	we just had a horror convention this weekend and so forth. I can't tell you how often I overhear
3650180	3657940	at some of these conventions. Why does it cost $50 to get a selfie with this person? Do they
3657940	3666580	really think they're worth that much? They got paid what they're worth.
3666580	3673300	How dare you utter that phrase and then go on the internet and complain that voice actors are
3673300	3681060	not paid enough. I'm not saying you have to buy the selfie and you have to buy the autograph.
3681060	3688820	You choose what you do and you don't want to get, that's fine. But how dare you bitch about a person
3688820	3696260	asking what they believe they're worth when you're going to go online and fight for that,
3696260	3700980	but you're not willing to do it in person when it's your own wallet. I just need everybody to
3701060	3709300	consider that for a minute. That's all. And with that being said, I would like to talk about,
3709300	3713620	well, I would like to talk about the struggle of voice actors and voice actresses again.
3713620	3718580	I would like to revisit this issue, but as far as Helena Taylor is concerned,
3719940	3724580	she's clearly burned her bridge. She's fine with that. She's not going to work in this industry
3724580	3729700	again, at least not on a AAA game, maybe an indie game, but she's not going to work in this industry
3729700	3734020	again. She seems very much fine with that. I wish her the best of luck with theater. I hope she
3734020	3738260	learns something from this whole thing. If she doesn't get a part or something in it, don't
3738260	3746100	boycott the whole production, ma'am. Honestly, this is probably going to bite her in the ass
3746100	3754100	in the theater world as well. It just might. Those universes are related. Yeah, no, you're
3754100	3759140	very correct. You're very correct on that. Well, considering this is all over social media and
3759140	3762980	stuff, people are going to hear about it. It's not like it's within the industry. What did you
3762980	3770980	think was going to happen? All right, let's move on. I'm ready for another topic. I really have
3770980	3776020	so many more rants in me than talking about Bayonetta. All right, let's go on to talking
3776020	3785860	about The Sims, Loki. You mean me? I'm sorry. Yeah. At any rate, yeah, it's about The Sims.
3785860	3794260	Sims Summit just happened. Basically, it's a structured version of their monthly stream,
3795460	3800740	so they did sneak peeks, announcements, updates for the Sim community, and then there is some
3800740	3811380	big stuff going on in the world. They have a partnership with Overwolf, which will have
3812340	3818020	a destination for in-game creators to upload, host, and share their mods, custom content,
3818020	3822580	and all that's curated. It's under trial. More information will come out this year.
3823620	3833860	Also, Sims 5 has been teased, and that's actually going to include, so they say, multiplayer.
3834580	3842580	It's called Project Rene, as in Renaissance, because they want this to be a renewal or
3842580	3848660	rebirth of the series. It will have the ability to play solo or with others, and it will build
3848660	3853700	on the current foundations. They're showing the build tools, not just custom colors anymore,
3853700	3859380	but different patterns, and changing the shape of furniture, free placement of pillows,
3859460	3866020	free placement of items, and then playing with other people whenever you want to,
3866020	3871940	and an identical version of it that plays on mobile. They were even showing that you can
3871940	3878100	do your modifications on mobile and insert them into your game on your computer.
3878100	3890580	Also, though, for Sims 4, they are doing an update to babies and toddlers in 2023.
3892100	3892820	Oh, hooray.
3894180	3895940	Well, a lot of people are into The Sims.
3895940	3900180	Yeah, no, no. I'm talking about the babies and toddlers, specifically. But no, I mean,
3900820	3905780	you used to love The Sims. You kind of, I don't want to say fell off the wagon,
3905780	3908020	but your interest went elsewhere.
3908500	3911540	You know how much it would be to buy the entirety of Sims 4?
3912500	3915620	Oh, God. Well, the base game's free now, but that ain't enough. Like,
3915620	3920660	all the stuff they've come out with after that, probably thousands of dollars at this point.
3921620	3929220	Yeah, so if you buy, and this is actually as of, like, someone posted this two years ago.
3929220	3936580	The cost without the base game is just DLC up to two years ago with $789.59.
3938180	3939700	Yeah, I think it's more than that now.
3939700	3942820	Yeah, right. That's why I'm specifying two years ago.
3943940	3948500	You know, it's disgusting. And I'm kind of tired of it.
3948500	3951300	I've started playing Sims 4 again, just with the stuff that I have.
3952980	3959140	But I downloaded it. I'll put it that way. I just installed my mods and then I was like,
3959140	3959780	I don't want to play.
3960420	3964580	Well, let's talk about mods, shall we? I think Loki has a companion piece to this.
3965460	3972740	Yeah, so another thing that was announced during that whole Sims Hub thing or Sims Summit
3973300	3980020	is that they're going to be adding a, like, I guess, a central resource for mods as well,
3980020	3986500	kind of a more curated type of thing. They're going to only have certain vited mod makers to
3987300	3994500	be there. They're calling it the mod squad. And I guess it's supposed to be a safer,
3994500	3998180	more centralized way to download stuff, even though they do have the Sims resource.
3998180	4003060	But because that's just a Sims resource is a subscription service,
4003060	4004740	although it's not an expensive one.
4006340	4012180	Yeah, so they're now going to have this mod squad thing to allow people to upload
4012740	4017780	their modifications and stuff. I don't see how that's necessarily going to make it better.
4017780	4021460	Well, if you're worried about your child downloading nudie and sex mods for Sims,
4021460	4024820	the mod squad to the rescue to curate everything and make sure the
4024820	4026340	super adult stuff doesn't get in there.
4027540	4029780	Yeah, I guess that's good at least.
4029780	4034820	That's kind of what it is to me. But I guess there's also a part where, like, you know,
4034820	4039380	I kind of look at, like, what Bethesda did with, like, Skyrim and even the Doom games.
4039380	4043540	Like, they've been kind of embracing official mods, but it's, it's extremely limited,
4043540	4047060	but at least it gives people kind of like a taste of that some of the most popular stuff.
4047060	4050340	That's kind of what I kind of heard in this. Yeah, yeah.
4051700	4054980	Yeah, I'm probably still going to keep using the Sims resource because I
4056660	4058660	their stuff doesn't have anything attached to it.
4058660	4063620	Yeah. I mean, despite what they say, you can disable all cookies. And if you're
4063620	4068180	like, like me on a Mac Safari will remove the majority of that for you.
4068900	4074180	So and, and you get a wider range, like they're saying, Oh, we're picking and
4074180	4081140	choosing who we invite to this program. But I, and I can tell the avatars that
4081140	4085140	they used in their little video, those were body mods, absolute body mods.
4087780	4095060	But I don't like the way some stuff looks. And I have a feeling they would want to keep with
4095060	4101380	their branded look for Sims. Because the faces on there were total like Maxis faces.
4102580	4108580	But I get my mod so that they don't look like Sims, if that makes sense.
4109220	4112820	I can play Sims, but they don't look freaking weird.
4114580	4120500	All right. Well, I want to bring up another story here, going to another fourth game in a popular
4120500	4125460	series. And let's talk about the Resident Evil four remake, shall we? We talked about Silent
4125460	4131140	Hill earlier, but there was also a Resident Evil stream this week, Capcom did a Resident Evil four
4131140	4135940	remake stream, and confirmed the game is not just coming to PS5, even though Sony showed it off
4135940	4141300	first, it will be coming out for Xbox series S and X, it will also come out for PlayStation four.
4141300	4145220	And if you get the PlayStation four version, you could upgrade to PS5 for free. So that that's
4145220	4149780	pretty cool. So there's some new gameplay footage that came out as well. And we're playing some of
4149780	4154500	that live on our show. For those that are on the podcast feed, you can find this trailer anywhere,
4154500	4160420	you can see where the you know, it's all over YouTube. And it does, it does look really nice,
4160420	4165700	I gotta say, especially considering how what a big game Resident Evil four is in the franchise,
4165700	4169700	there's a lot of pressure for this game to be not just a good remake, like two and three,
4169700	4174900	but to really deliver on what people loved about four. So again, there was more screenshots,
4174900	4178340	there's also some special editions that they announced will be coming as well. I mean,
4178340	4182500	why not? A deluxe edition and a collector's edition all releasing when this comes out on
4182500	4187940	March 24 2023. The deluxe edition will have additional in game content, costume weapons,
4187940	4194260	a treasure map, the physical box only collector's edition also have physical map, art book,
4194260	4200020	a Leon figure, why not? And much more. So there's, you know, a lot of things that are in this.
4200020	4202340	So it's going to be what's your face less annoying?
4203140	4207620	Uh, who knows? Uh, well, Ada Wong still be fierce as hell, I'm sure.
4207620	4209140	Well, Ada's fierce at everything.
4210580	4217220	At least in the screenshot, she looks great. Uh, one thing that doesn't have fans quite as
4217220	4223060	excited was some of this news that came out about the dog. Um, you see in the original
4223060	4228820	Resident Evil four, there's a dog that you can save from a trap. But, uh, in the footage,
4229060	4233940	it was seen that the trap has already taken care of the dog. And it doesn't seem like you can
4233940	4238340	share the dog anymore. Uh, the dog was killed in a very gruesome way in the footage. And it's
4238340	4246020	pretty upsetting to see now. I, is it the same dog? I don't know. But anyway, I, you know what?
4246660	4248740	You can also just be the recording.
4248740	4253060	It could be. Well, and here's the other thing. It's, it's so interesting to me. Like I,
4254020	4258660	I'm like, I don't like to see dead dogs in video games either. And I don't like to see dead cats
4258660	4264420	at all. Dead people. I'm sure they did something wrong. Let them be killed. But when I see the
4264420	4270500	animals, I don't like it. I'm like, why can't they replace the dog with a person? That's where my
4270500	4280980	brain's at right now. But anyway, hopefully the video was a misdirect and you will still be able
4280980	4289540	to save the dog. Um, but the early footage does not look good. In fact, um, one of my favorite
4289540	4294980	reactions to this whole thing was the, um, Twitter account. Do you guys follow? Can you pet the dog
4294980	4303140	on Twitter? It's a really good Twitter account. And what they do is they actually, um, talk about
4303140	4308340	in different games. Uh, they answer the question, are you able to pet the dog or not? And in this
4308420	4314420	game, all they had to say about this was quite simply, um, what the fuck was all they said about
4314420	4320260	this? Oops. Sorry. Some additional noises coming in from the video there, but yeah,
4320260	4324420	all they had to say about that was what the fuck? I thought that was-
4324420	4325780	Say that about everything, every day.
4328180	4335380	So, all right. Um, yeah. Darktitsia in chat says, yeah, says it all. Pretty much. Let's just,
4335380	4339620	and Darktitsia says someone on Twitter claims it might be a misdirect. So here's hoping. Here's
4339620	4344020	hoping you can still save the dog, uh, just like you could in the original Resident Evil 4. But
4344020	4349860	yeah, I know those remakes are coming and people are very excited about it. Um, let's talk about
4349860	4355060	our next story. This might be a difficult one with some content warnings here for some folks to hear
4355060	4361220	about, but it's necessary to talk about, right Dark Sakura? Yeah. So I'm sure that a lot of
4361220	4369220	people have been following, um, the situation going on with, uh, Amaranth. Um, Amaranth, um,
4370260	4376820	had a stream where, uh, she recorded a phone conversation with her husband. She basically
4376820	4383300	had, you know, hidden the fact that she was married, presumably on his suggestion that it
4383300	4391060	would like help her brand and, and everything. Um, but she recorded a conversation with him
4391620	4398180	showing how abusive he was and talking about controlling her finances and cutting her off
4398180	4405860	from things and, and everything. So, um, she finally came out and talked about it. The,
4405860	4413620	the stream, uh, the, the video is available, uh, to see, um, on Twitch. It's still on her channel,
4413620	4422500	A-M-O-U-R-A-N-T-H, um, about 33 minutes in, uh, where it starts talking about, and it is talking
4422500	4428900	pretty heavily about abuse. Um, but, um, she's quoted saying, um, as for the husband situation,
4428900	4433860	some of you probably saw the other night he called me during a stream and I disappeared for like two
4433860	4438660	hours. Then I finally unmuted about an hour and a half into the call and I apologize if that was
4438660	4446420	hard to watch for people. I didn't really know what else to do. Um, and then apparently he heard
4446420	4453860	himself on the recording and like finally dug in what he sounds like. And so he's off getting help.
4454820	4460260	And then, and she says, uh, that she has access to all of her accounts and finances again,
4460820	4469060	and is seeking, uh, legal and emotional counsel. And I like this one too. I actually was watching
4469060	4473300	some of it. Um, I like this quote. I didn't think that many people would give a shit to be honest.
4473300	4477700	It's kind of crazy. Even haters like, damn, I fucking hate Amaranth, but you know what? I hope
4477700	4491300	she's okay. That's so nice. You know? Um, and so, uh, uh, I think that domestic abuse
4493060	4499140	is especially as a spouse that tries to control everything about your life. And I've watched my
4499140	4508100	mom go through this, you know, abuse isn't just being, you know, hit or injured. It's words,
4508100	4513940	it's actions, it's deeds, it's controlling. It's the sense of dominance where you feel
4514580	4522020	utterly powerless and it eats and eats and eats and eats at you. And, and I, I know this, I mean,
4522020	4527220	not with Dan. Dan's great. Um, besides that I could handle his ass if I wanted to. Um, I know
4528100	4534580	I always make the joke. He knows he makes the joke. But, um, but the, the thing is, is that
4534580	4539940	I grew up in a pretty abusive household. Um, I haven't made any secret of it, but you know,
4539940	4545060	I'm not going to go into extra detail. And a lot of it was emotional, uh, trying to control,
4545060	4555220	trying to dominate. Um, and I, I I've seen people go through it. I have gone through a degree of it
4555620	4564260	and it really just, I'm glad that she's out from, from under him, that hopefully him getting help
4564260	4572900	is actually what does the job. Um, and, uh, the police, now this is what's disgusting to me is
4572900	4577380	that she said that she'd gone to the police before to explain a situation, but they would not take
4577380	4584100	any action unless she had suffered physical harm. That's bullshit. Abuse is abuse.
4584340	4591300	Abuse is abuse. And if someone comes in saying, I don't feel safe in my home, you take care of it.
4591300	4596740	This is how people die is why don't another reason I don't trust the police. I'm just saying,
4597620	4605060	you know, I I've, I've seen it happen where a person will go over and over and say, Hey,
4605060	4610340	I'm not feeling safe or Hey, he's doing this or Hey, this is happening. And then finally
4610340	4616340	she ends up dead because police wouldn't do shit. Fucking disgusting. You know?
4617300	4621140	But anyway, can I just a quick aside, but it literally, and I know this is going to
4621140	4624420	come off weird, but like I have to say it, it kind of reminds me of the whole thing.
4624420	4628340	Cause you know, that, that Dahmer series on Netflix is all over the news. I refuse to
4628340	4632340	watch it. I know. I know. I completely understand why people have their reservations about that. But
4633060	4636980	I, one of the scenes I saw, I haven't seen the show, but I saw a scene. I really like
4636980	4642420	Niecy Nash who's in it. Um, and she plays a part and she's in a scene where she's trying to get
4642420	4647060	help for one of the victims, but police won't do anything about it because it didn't meet a certain
4647060	4652980	criteria. And it just like, like screaming internally, like knowing how that ends. Anyway,
4652980	4658980	I'm sorry. I don't mean to, but it's just like, it's like, you kind of see it happening there
4658980	4663620	too. And that situation is to see, we kind of look at it and go, why aren't we getting people
4663620	4669780	that are asking for help, help? And this is not uncommon. Yeah. This happens more often
4670580	4677460	than is advertised. This is just more, uh, uh, ingrained misogyny.
4678980	4686260	You know, it, the, they're not there to protect people. I'll just leave that there. Um, but one
4686260	4691220	thing that she said that really, you know, strikes a chord with me is that she says she's looking
4691300	4696660	forward to having friends again, sleeping, being able to wear clothes that she wants,
4697540	4701940	you know, take, and that she is going to take time to process things, spend time with her dogs,
4701940	4710100	uh, feel like a person. And I get that too. You know, after, after, um, my mom and my stepdad
4710100	4718100	divorced, I kind of had to figure out who I was, you know, out from under being scared all the
4718100	4728420	time. Um, so I want to also take this, uh, this moment to say that if you, anyone who
4728420	4735060	hears my voice, if you are in an emotionally abusive relationship, you can get help.
4736020	4741700	Um, you know, if you are cut off from your family and friends, or you're isolated,
4741940	4745540	if they've cut off your, your funding, take control of your finances,
4746180	4759220	um, that's abuse. That is abuse right there. Um, there are, um, there are, uh, there's a national
4759220	4766820	domestic violence hotline here in the US. In the UK, there's crisis text line. Um, UK also has
4766820	4774100	domestic and sexual abuse, uh, helpline as well, phone as well as email. And if you feel, um, that
4774100	4780980	you are in immediate danger and coming under harm, you contact emergency services, even if they don't
4780980	4786820	do anything, you'll have a paper trail. It has to be processed. And if they say, oh, we're not gonna,
4786820	4794180	you know, do anything, you ask them why they're refusing to, you know, to record the situation
4794260	4802020	and you seek legal counsel, if you can. There are plenty of pro bono legal services for domestic
4802020	4809300	abuse victims. And yeah, do it. You know what else I'm sadly reminded of when you talk about
4809300	4812900	the controlling of the finances and what she was doing and all that, I'm reminded of the Britney
4812900	4818980	Spears situation. And, um, that was abuse. Absolutely. And that was, but it was also
4818980	4827060	sanctioned by the government. The government gave that dad legal rights to do this. Like it's, it's,
4827060	4832260	it's, but I know, I know that the conservatorship is a whole nother thing, but I can't help but be
4832260	4838260	reminded as we talk about the system being set up to fail many of these individuals.
4838260	4846260	It's being set up to control women, to silence us and to, you know, keep the cisgender white male
4847220	4851460	in, in charge or white straight male, whatever Christian dude in charge,
4852260	4856740	because that is default in this country. Um, and I'm sure there's people out there
4856740	4859300	that are like, what the fuck are you doing talking about this? This is, is this really
4859300	4865540	about video games? Absolutely. On top of that, she's, she's a Twitch streamer.
4865540	4870740	Yeah. That's what I'm saying. There's, there's a lot into, I'm, I'm sure people didn't care for her
4871380	4877300	because maybe I don't, I don't know this streamer at all. This was the first I heard of Amaranth
4877300	4881380	and I saw the videos and, you know, I was like, Oh my gosh, this is, this is horrible. I hope she's
4881380	4884980	okay. It was like literally the thoughts going through my video. And I'm very glad to hear she's
4884980	4888740	where she needs to be. She's getting help. That makes me feel great. Just, you know, I don't know
4888740	4893780	her as a streamer. I'm not going to profess to know, but like, it appears that if she was
4893780	4899460	unpopular, perhaps people saw that it was a calculated presentation that she was putting out
4899460	4906260	on stream. Maybe what they didn't know is who was calculating it. And now a lot of that has come,
4906260	4911940	come to light now. I was to say all that aside, I think it just shows a deeper level that like
4911940	4917060	streamers, and this includes me, Loki and Jamie. This includes many of the people that you watch.
4917060	4923780	Streamers are real fucking people with real fucking people problems. And I go ahead. So I
4923860	4929780	don't mean to keep cutting. I had to cut out, um, a streamer out of my life for,
4931380	4935380	I'm not going to go too much into detail on it, but for being a very toxic and abusive
4936180	4942580	individual who pretty much is so self centered, they can't see how what they do affects other
4942580	4950980	people. And as someone who has been through, um, domestic abuse as a child, you know, both
4950980	4958820	emotional, everything. I hit that block button within five seconds. You don't be afraid to cut
4958820	4967380	someone out of your life if they are causing you distress. Well, and I'm also going to say,
4967380	4972580	you know, knowing that she is unpopular, quote, I'm using my quotey fingers and so forth.
4972580	4977460	She's unpopular. I'm sure. Well, there's clearly she said in that statement, even my haters. So
4977460	4983220	she has haters, right? My point is, and my point is, watch how much of that hate you're putting
4983220	4988340	out online, because we are real fucking people, right? And luckily, we don't have to deal with
4988340	4992340	that at the level. I mean, we've all dealt with it in one way or another. But Amaranth certainly
4992340	4997380	dealt with it a lot more. My point is, why put all that negativity out there in the first place?
4997380	5002100	Because you don't know what struggles people are having when the cameras are off. So it costs
5002100	5007780	nothing to be kind. Thank you. That's a very succinct way to put it. It costs nobodies to
5007780	5016340	be kind. My, my, my former manager at my job used to have this placard outside of this cubicle that
5016340	5024420	said be kind because everybody is fighting a hard battle. Yeah. So and that's why I think this is
5024420	5029220	more than appropriate to be discussing here, especially as Twitch culture is gaining more
5029220	5035460	and more. I mean, we just talked about yesterday, or sorry, not yesterday, last week, it felt like
5035460	5040900	yesterday, we just talked about last week, the death of a traditional gaming network.
5042260	5048820	Because it can't compete with where modern viewing eyes are going. And that's Twitch and YouTube and
5048820	5054900	those sorts of custom created things. There was a whole insider article on that G4 debacle this
5054900	5063620	week that was shared in our discord over at vognetwork.com. That was very enlightening. I
5063620	5069460	thought that whole article was very interesting. There's another factor to consider too. This goes
5069460	5076820	beyond just streaming but goes into the realm of like multiplayer games. Voice Chat is still
5077540	5086740	a very toxic environment for women and female presenting people who go into multiplayer chats.
5087380	5091940	Well, and you remember I got bullied off of Twitch once already I was on there in 2017.
5092820	5098260	But I mean, now I've got a really good supportive community, especially now that you know,
5098260	5099620	I've made those cuts.
5099620	5104260	Well, and you know, the OL army's got your back. You know, you always we have a we have a small by
5104260	5108740	Twitch standards, but loyal few and we heart you all so much for that.
5109780	5114900	Yeah, we absolutely do. But I mean, the other thing too is that always I have to remind myself
5114900	5119620	and this was something that it took me a while to learn after escaping that situation is that
5121700	5128420	the people who are like that they don't know you. They haven't taken the time to get to know you.
5128420	5136020	Why? Why let them hurt you? You know, if they're and if they're in your home,
5136580	5143380	and they're using what they know of you to be this person, then you owe it to yourself
5143380	5151300	to value yourself more than what then their words. If you're in a dangerous situation,
5151300	5156660	there are ways of getting out of it. There are places that will help you. There are ways of
5156740	5162900	hiding your location hiding your identity from people that would track you. The help is there.
5165620	5166660	All right, that's it.
5167460	5172420	Let's move on to some more stories. We'll go into our next story kind of going back to
5173220	5178100	some of the mainstream game news and some games that won't be around much longer. Right, Loki?
5178980	5183220	Yeah, it's just typical EA. So they're shutting that's all you need to say.
5183780	5188420	Oh, now in the news tonight. EA is being EA Thank you. See you next week.
5189060	5192660	They're shutting down. Well, I mean, to be fair, Ubisoft is the same thing.
5194100	5199460	Recently as well, but they're just as bad. So they're shutting down some old servers for
5199460	5207940	some older games that you may have played. So including, of course, we have, you know,
5207940	5212660	these are actually as of even last week, they already shut down some of the servers. So we
5212660	5218820	had army of two, the 40th day and army of two, the devil's cartel, as well as Dragon Age origins,
5218820	5224900	the multiplayer screenshots server has been shut down. November 9, they're going to be shutting
5224900	5229060	down the command and conquer red alert three command and conquer three Tiberium Wars and
5229060	5236100	command conquer three canes raft as well as mercenary to world in flames. That's those are
5236100	5241060	all going to be shut down November 9 on rush is going down, which is not even that old.
5241460	5251300	November 30. And then finally, January 19, they're going to be putting out was it mirrors edge NBA
5251300	5261620	jam on fire edition gatling gears and shank two are all going down. So that's, that's annoying.
5262500	5268020	So what this will how this will affect your games. Some of these you know, they're you're
5268980	5273140	just not gonna be able to play obviously online some of them it will block some of the achievements
5273140	5280420	that required you to be online in order to get those as well. So yeah, that kind of sucks. If
5280420	5285380	you're if you're looking to get those achievements. Some of those may be too late on but you know,
5286180	5290180	I'm used all the time dark to see and chat says well to be fair mirrors edge has been up since
5290180	5294900	2008. Don't encourage them. No, I mean, I get it. Nothing can really last forever in that regard.
5294900	5298980	But yeah, as Joe and Matt says, I was honestly surprised some of those servers are still up
5298980	5304900	mostly mirrors edge. The achievement aspect does suck. Yeah. So I mean, I think I like to think
5304900	5310180	developers have learned a lot since designing those earlier Xbox 360 style achievements like
5310180	5315060	you know, achievements have been in our in our industry for God probably 15 years now, right?
5315060	5320740	So I think developers for the most part of guidance gotten smarter at making more everlasting
5320740	5324820	achievements that don't necessarily require the game to you'll play in multiplayer mode.
5324820	5330820	There's still a few of those out there. But yeah, I feel like we're starting to see less of those
5330820	5335380	that really rely on the you know, multiplayer and online features because most games, you know,
5335380	5340100	especially if you're Babylon's fall. There's a lot of games that don't last even a year sometimes
5340100	5343540	find out the Final Fantasy mobile game. What the hell was that that one they just pulled out the
5343540	5349060	Final Fantasy seven spin off mobile. Yeah, I don't remember now, which clearly made an impact if I
5349060	5356420	can't even remember the fucking name. So anyway, mobile game Battle Royale Final Fantasy some Yeah.
5357700	5363140	All right. And Mike Defton chats is not even Prime Minister's last that long. Oh,
5363140	5369940	I love a good callback joke. Thank you very much. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about another
5369940	5373860	story which has to do with Microsoft and maybe something they're planning for in the future.
5374500	5379300	It is a branded mobile game store. But that's interesting to me because I go,
5379300	5384740	but Xbox and Microsoft tried to do the mobile phones and that didn't really last. They didn't
5384740	5390740	really get into that. So what exactly are they doing? Well, they have done a filing with UK's
5390740	5395540	Competition and Markets Authority or the CMA. And they're having to do this because they're
5395540	5399860	basically the CMA has a lot of questions about the Activision Blizzard merger, and it almost
5399860	5404660	looks like they don't want to approve it. So Xbox has kind of had to show a little bit about
5404660	5410660	what the plans are to do a next gen Xbox store that would be on mobile devices, as well as
5410660	5417460	console and PCs. And I see some of this today because like if you look like even on, you know,
5417460	5423060	Google or Apple, there is an Xbox app that allows you to interact with the store for your consoles
5423060	5427860	or your PC, like you can download game pass games, and like have them queue up. So they're there when
5427860	5432820	you get home and doing that through mobile. So it makes a little bit of sense that maybe Microsoft
5432820	5439060	is looking to kind of expand that into other games that are just game pass and maybe for mobile games
5439060	5443860	as well. I'm not sure how that works. I mean, because I'm pretty sure the rules of Apple,
5443860	5448820	at least if not maybe Google as well, would prevent them from doing that within an app.
5448820	5453140	But you can do anything through the web, which is where they went for their cloud based gaming. So
5453140	5457300	maybe it's going to be a web app. I don't know. But what we do know is that they're looking at
5457300	5463460	this for things like Call of Duty mobile, the more casual games, because remember, it's Activision
5463460	5469140	Blizzard King, and King really lives in this space like Candy Crush and that stuff too, right?
5469140	5474020	So it is something they're looking at. And they have said it will require a major shift in consumer
5474020	5479300	habits with the competition that's currently out there. They are going to apply the open app store
5479300	5485540	philosophy to the Xbox mobile shop, and so on and so on. So it's, it's interesting that they're going
5485540	5492100	this way. They're having to show this again, because of the merger that they want to do.
5492100	5495700	So we know some of their future plans in this, because they want to get through
5496500	5500900	the merger with the CMA and have that approved. Because there's a lot of talk about is it going
5500900	5505860	to be approved? And it sounds like if it's not approved, it's all Bobby Kotick's fault.
5506740	5508660	I don't understand how he is still.
5511380	5513460	There's someone who needs to be dropped into a pit.
5513940	5521140	Just, just fade into obscurity. Just honestly. So like the, that's the,
5521140	5527860	that's the person that needs to stick to theater is Bobby Kotick. My gosh. All right. Anyhow,
5528500	5533140	let's go back to a simpler time. I was gonna say a simpler time when there wasn't mobile games.
5533780	5538980	But actually, I don't think that's the case tonight. But let's roll the official bump, please.
5543460	5554500	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault
5554500	5559940	and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
5560660	5565780	And Dark Soccer, I have a feeling you're picking one of those games that we don't want to believe
5565780	5572260	is 10 years old, but it is, huh? Yeah, and I did it for you actually.
5572260	5578260	Oh, I do like this game. Yeah. So anyway, the game is Giana Sisters
5578260	5584420	Twisted Dreams. It was a platformer developed by Black Forest Games for Windows. And it is
5584420	5592740	the successor to the 1987 Commodore 64 title, The Great Giana Sisters, and a sequel to the
5592740	5599060	reimagining Giana Sisters DS. It's a crowdfunded game with Kickstarter, and it hits a goal of
5599060	5611060	$150,000. In addition to that Windows release, there's been a console port. There's other things
5611060	5616820	going on, a little drama, but we'll get to that in a second. So that's for the plot of the game.
5616820	5622980	Maria is abducted to the dream world, and a dragon is holding her prisoner, and Giana
5624660	5633940	has to go enter the dream world to get her. And so she can manipulate her dreams to switch between
5634900	5639860	dreams and be a cute or punk persona to deal with different things as she goes along.
5639860	5652980	So after Giana Sisters DS came out, Spellbound Entertainment went bankrupt, and Armin Gesserit
5652980	5660420	died. And so Black Forest Games was founded by key members from Spellbound and took over all
5660420	5668740	the Spellbound's assets, including all the intellectual property. So they worked on the
5668740	5679060	Giana Sisters title beginning in early 2011. There were conditions that were put on them in
5679060	5686500	order for the game to see a release, and so they wanted a lot cut out. So they were really working
5686500	5690340	on it. I mean, people kept thinking that it was a copycat of Super Mario Brothers, but they really
5691380	5697140	were trying to change it into something unique. And so it turned into what was called Project
5697140	5707060	Giana so they could transform. And so the world changes when she changes, and there's all kinds
5707060	5717780	of other stuff, different attacks that they have in each form. And what they did with this one,
5717780	5726260	they went for a 3D design instead of the DS's 2D design. And then they thought about shelving
5726260	5733780	the game so they could try to fund it themselves. But the Kickstarter was so successful that they
5733780	5738660	kept going, kept doing the crowdfunding, they kept making it happen, and they hit their goal on July
5738660	5749860	30th, 2012. So with the fundraiser, they announced Xbox Live Arcade and PSN support. The stretchy
5749860	5757140	goal was that it would be a 16-level release and a full version 20-level release at $200,000.
5758740	5764100	And if it hit the goal, there was going to be Ouya support for $300,000.
5764100	5765380	Oh no, not that.
5766100	5768340	Well, this is right when it came out.
5768340	5772980	I know. It's wild to me that we're talking about Kickstarter-backed games and the classic Game
5772980	5776420	of the Week segment, but it is 10 years old. It's just wild to me.
5776420	5778900	To be fair, at least it came out.
5780580	5784340	That's more than we can say about some other recent consoles.
5785940	5796340	As I was saying, they hit that goal and amassed a total of $186,159 on the official Kickstarter
5796340	5802980	and then reached $190,000 when PayPal pledges were added in. They had a livestream to celebrate
5803220	5806820	and they had interviews and all kinds of stuff.
5807700	5814340	On August 30th, 2012, Project Giana was among the first to be featured on Valve's Steam Greenlight.
5816500	5821540	October 15th, 2012, it was a fully greenlit for release on Steam.
5823540	5829140	Fans were invited to vote for their title to be used. So there was also Twisted Dream,
5829140	5831380	Giana's Twisted Dream, or Project Giana.
5831940	5837460	And so the game was revealed to be Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams on September 21st, 2012.
5838980	5845060	The music had the original composer for the first great Giana Sisters, Chris Hulsbeck,
5846180	5853540	and the Swedish heavy metal band Maschine Supremacy, and Fabian Del Priore, who worked
5853540	5857380	on Giana Sisters DS. And the soundtrack is actually really freaking good.
5858340	5862660	The CD was offered as a reward on the Kickstarter.
5863620	5870900	So as for the release, it was originally a digital release October 23rd, 2012. That's today.
5872340	5873140	Wow.
5873140	5874180	It's the anniversary.
5874180	5875140	Exactly. Wow.
5876180	5878500	Yeah. Did I time it or did I time it?
5878500	5879300	Timed it pretty well.
5880100	5887860	The DLC was released on September 26th, 2013 for Windows. And if you backed the Kickstarter,
5887860	5889220	you got it for free.
5889220	5891460	I did. Backed the Kickstarter.
5892500	5896180	Rise of the Alverlord could be purchased by itself as a standalone game.
5896740	5901540	On September 5th, 2013, Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams was released for the Wii U.
5901540	5906900	It was a physical director's cut for PS4 and Xbox One on December 12th, 2014.
5906900	5912260	And it included Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams Rise of the Alverlord.
5912980	5916340	That's O-W-L, if you think I'm saying it funny.
5916340	5922180	And then the Ultimate Edition was released on the Switch September 25th, 2018.
5923140	5927220	It had the director's cut and five more levels and cut scenes.
5928420	5934900	It was met pretty favorably. It got pretty decent scores. It looks beautiful.
5934900	5938580	People love that you can immerse yourself in the world.
5941060	5944580	At Destructoid, it was said that it was a labor of Euro love.
5947300	5951700	And they said it was very polished controls and excellent gameplay.
5952420	5954500	Lots of stuff to find in this game.
5955220	5960820	One of the things that I think is interesting, though, is that they promised a Mac and Linux
5960820	5968420	version after they did the Humble Indie Bundle 11 in February 2014, but hasn't been released.
5969220	5974660	And the Switch version was released by Handy Games, which is a THQ Nordic subsidiary.
5975460	5977460	And so that's it.
5978420	5980500	All right. Great pick.
5980500	5987780	Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, a game that literally barely makes the cut as a 10-year-old game.
5987780	5992660	But wow, it's just fascinating to think how far we've come in 10 years.
5992660	5995780	But this game still looks really good today, to be honest.
5996820	6000180	Yeah, it totally would fit in any sort of modern release.
6000180	6003300	Absolutely. And I've played this game a little bit before.
6004020	6008500	It's interesting. Giana Sisters, the original in Commodore 64, is really known for two things.
6008500	6013540	It's known for the Mario Brothers lawsuit because it took a lot of cues from Mario
6013540	6017700	Brothers and had a lot of various similarities to it, and even the name reminiscent of Mario
6017700	6022500	Brothers. And then the music. The music was incredible in the Commodore 64 version of the
6022500	6029380	game. Ask anybody who follows chiptunes of that era, like top 10 soundtracks from Commodore 64,
6029380	6031460	Giana Sisters is going to be on it every single time.
6032500	6037060	So it's interesting, but the game itself wasn't very good.
6038900	6042020	It's going to have its defenders. There's people that are going to say I'm wrong.
6042020	6049140	Too bad. It isn't very good. However, the sequel, the this one is a good game.
6049140	6054180	And because it came up, it wasn't just a Mario Brothers rip off, it came up with the whole idea
6054180	6062500	of the switching and all that stuff that I think works a lot better. So yeah, I think it works
6062500	6068580	great. And it just yeah, it just was a great game as a result. And it's interesting to see
6068580	6072820	a game that was the subject of a lawsuit and controversy back in the Commodore 64 games
6072820	6076660	really get like a second and even third life because the DS version was out there.
6076660	6079860	But then this one, I think a lot more people saw because of Kickstarter and
6079860	6081620	it's been given away. It's a true sequel.
6081620	6087700	Yeah, it's a real true sequel. And really evolved on the formula.
6087700	6093780	Yeah, for sure. All right, let's travel around and check out some rapid fire news.
6093780	6099460	And we'll start with Loki. Yeah. So we've been having this trend
6099460	6104180	lately where folks will decompile a game and then, well, they will decompile it.
6104180	6111780	They'll basically recreate the code from scratch, reverse engineer it. And so the next game to
6111780	6116900	fit that bill is going to be Perfect Dark, the original game that was out on Nintendo 64.
6117780	6129060	They have made they've been able to recreate the game, release a reverse engineer, I guess.
6129060	6135540	And now it is ported to PC. And you, of course, can, you know,
6136420	6140900	up the resolution, do all sorts of crazy stuff with that you wouldn't have been able to before.
6141460	6149140	And, you know, what they basically this is actually now a process that uses, I think,
6149140	6153460	the actual and I don't know if it uses the actual N64 ROM to revert.
6153460	6157380	You have to have the ROM and then reverse engineer it with that using a tool.
6158580	6163060	But either way, you end up being able to play it on PC and it runs negatively,
6163060	6167140	which is pretty awesome. So I'm sure that's out there on the web,
6167140	6172180	ready for Nintendo or actually, I don't know, it's a rare game, but maybe Nintendo will smack
6172180	6175380	it down. Maybe Microsoft smack it down. Somebody will smack it down.
6177460	6183220	And then there is a brand new Mortal Kombat game called Onslaught, which is coming out for mobile.
6183220	6191300	And it is a they call it a mobile exclusive cinematic story experience for the series.
6191300	6197060	Cool, I guess. Cool, if you're into mobile games.
6197060	6204740	Yeah, it's yeah, it's a reimagined Mortal Kombat into a strategic team based collection RPG with
6204740	6209780	fast. Yeah, it sounds like literally almost most of the mobile games out there. But yeah,
6209780	6216260	if you want one with a Mortal Kombat, you know, layer of paint on it. Here you go.
6216340	6216840	Enjoy.
6218980	6226180	Let's talk about Mario Party. Jason kind of mentioned it in the intro. Not to it's not
6226180	6230340	Mario Party three. It's actually Mario Party one. But do you remember the box art for the original
6230340	6236100	Mario Party? It made it look like it was Mario Party three, because the the way the box art was,
6236100	6239380	I have it. I have a copy of it here. I can show on the other screen real quick.
6239620	6244580	It had the dice on it. And so it looked like it was Mario Party three. I don't know. But it's
6244580	6251460	actually the original Mario Party. Mario Party one and two are coming out for the switch online
6251460	6258500	expansion pack. You know, the backwards compatible Nintendo 64 library. So pilot wing 64 just came
6258500	6263460	out this last month. And Nintendo has confirmed that Mario Party and Mario Party two are coming
6263460	6267860	out for the Switch Online expansion pack. And they're coming out for the Nintendo 64
6268260	6274580	and Mario Party two will be arriving on November 2. So if you are ready to ruin friendships online,
6275300	6280820	through playing online with the Nintendo Switch Online plan, you can you can do that. So if you
6280820	6285940	want to make enemies coast to coast, you have that ability through a Mario Party. Of course,
6285940	6290260	there's also Mario Party games that exist on Switch. But you know, if you want to classically
6290260	6295700	ruin friendships, you can do that with the original Mario Party one and two. In a little
6295700	6301700	bit more of a traditional game type of news also coming for the switch but also PlayStation five
6301700	6309780	Xbox series PlayStation four Xbox one is right in three cross Mikado maniacs. This is coming out on
6309780	6316580	February 23, 2023. It will be out in Japan for 3800 yen. There's also gonna be a 7200 yen limited
6316580	6324100	edition which has a diorama you know you need that to soundtrack CD and a special box. So this is
6324100	6329220	right in three, but it has background music remixes by artists that are produced by games
6329220	6333700	that are Akado like if you want to know like what is that whole name about? So you get basically
6333700	6339140	different music in there. Some of the artists include heavy metal right and reuse star for
6339140	6344180	those of you that follow on Konami series that might sound familiar to you. Daisuke Matsumoto,
6344180	6349060	so she hosts I and so on and so on. So there's a lot of cool stuff in there over 20 enhanced
6349060	6353700	background music tracks are coming which is pretty cool. So that is all coming out
6353700	6361460	on February 23. And darted see it says, I'm kind of hyped for this. I have the sequel right in four
6361460	6366260	cross Mikado. And they have some of their stuff on YouTube if you want to hear it. If you love heavy
6366260	6372660	metal, and who doesn't, this stuff is going to be your jam. So very cool. Alright, well, let's
6372660	6376900	travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner than right in
6376980	6385060	three cross Mikado. We have dungeons of aether, which is by the folks that made rivals of aether.
6385060	6393540	And that is coming out on PC mount in blade to banner Lord on PC PlayStation four PlayStation
6393540	6403060	five Xbox one and Xbox series. Victoria three on PC Mac and Linux. Yo, looks like your Marwari
6403780	6413780	lost in the dark on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four ace angler fishing spirits on
6414340	6421860	Nintendo Switch. We have aquarium on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four. It's a visual novel,
6421860	6430180	not a not a fish sim sorry. Decapo for fortunate departures on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four
6430980	6441860	gunfire reborn on Xbox one and Xbox series. Needy streamers overlord overload that is a weird
6441860	6448260	looking game. Needy streamer overlord overload not overlord. That's a whole different game.
6448260	6456900	Nintendo Switch sack boys big adventure on PC. We have signalists on PC, Nintendo Switch,
6456980	6464100	PlayStation four and Xbox one star ocean the divine force on PC, PlayStation four,
6464100	6470500	PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. Also, it appears that we have ace angler
6470500	6476340	fishing spirits on Nintendo Switch. I'm guessing these are different regions probably for that.
6479060	6485620	Also, we've got Bayonetta three, a game of no controversy whatsoever coming out on
6485620	6492340	Nintendo Switch. Call of Duty, Modern Warfare two. It's like I'm back several decades ago.
6494500	6499380	No, this is a new one, and that is on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one
6499380	6507860	and Xbox series and does look pretty good. Chris, let's see, we've got crystallize on PC,
6508820	6517460	dungeon munchies on PlayStation four and PlayStation five. Resident Evil reverse on
6518180	6526740	PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one. And Yamawari lost in the dark also coming out on PC,
6527620	6532420	Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four. I'm guessing this is also another region,
6532420	6536420	European release date. I don't know why that's on my release dates, but whatever.
6537060	6541220	All right, that is it. We're traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases on the
6541220	6546820	Nintendo Switch this week. We have Needy Girl Overdose, but it's in English, but it is getting
6546820	6551940	a Japanese release this week on the 27th. DC 4 Decapo, Fortunate Departures, also out in Japan
6551940	6557220	this week on the Switch. Ace Angler Fishing Spirits in an English and a multi-language
6557220	6562420	release, two separate releases. A game called Aquarium gets a release as well. There's also
6562420	6566420	a special Dead by Daylight, Sadako Rising, official Japanese version. So I'm assuming
6566420	6572180	that comes with the Ringu DLC that was, it's been out for some while, but it's just a re-release of
6572180	6576740	that because I think DVD is gaining popularity in Japan actually. And it's in part, thanks to some
6576740	6581860	of these characters they're including. A game called SnowRunner is getting a price reduction.
6581860	6587140	That's pretty cool. As well as a game called Signalus is coming out on the Switch this week
6587140	6592740	in Japan. There's also a split pad fit coming out for the Nintendo Switch. There's one for Gengar
6592740	6599380	and Pikachu. Oh, these are, oh, I see what this is. They're like joy cons that make your controller
6599380	6604100	like bigger. It's kind of neat. It makes the buttons kind of all in a different place. So
6604100	6610180	it's kind of neat. So that is coming out. If you, you know, you need better grips on your
6610180	6615380	Nintendo Switch, check that out in Japan this week. Also, of course, Bayonetta 3. Interesting
6615380	6620500	though, because earlier in the show, we were talking about, um, Japanese voice actors and
6620500	6628100	so forth. Uh, the release for Japan is marked as English. So I'm not sure if they did localization
6628100	6633460	for this. Uh, it may still be in English, uh, maybe with Japanese subtitles. Just,
6633460	6637780	I just noticed that on the releases, they do say this is in English. So kind of interesting,
6638340	6644180	but that is it for the Switch this week, going to the PlayStation 5, uh, and looking at the
6644180	6649460	releases there, Star Ocean, the Defying Force is out on October 27th, as well as again, the Dead
6649460	6653460	by Daylight, Sadako Rising is also on PlayStation 5, cause you know, that game's everywhere.
6653460	6659220	Uh, The Legend of Heroes, Kuro no Kiseuke 2 is out this week, uh, in Japan as well on the PlayStation
6659220	6666900	5. So pretty busy week, but understandable. It was a busy week in music as well. So it's a very
6666900	6672420	busy time. Um, I see Dark Sakura is just now sitting down. So I don't know if you want to do
6672500	6676820	Europe releases or you want me to. Oh, she's going to do it. Okay. So I'll turn it over to
6676820	6681940	Dark Sakura for the European releases. Uh, sorry about that. My voice is cutting out quite a bit
6681940	6687700	now. No worries. I just want to make sure you're okay to do it. No, I appreciate that. I appreciate
6687700	6696180	that very much. So, uh, for this week on the 25th for PlayStation and Xbox, we have Melt and Blade
6696180	6702260	2. We also have Miraculous Rise of the Sphinx also for Switch, add into that. On the 27th,
6702260	6707860	we have Star Ocean, The Divine Force on PlayStation, Xbox on the, on the big three,
6708500	6716900	Asterix Novelisk, um, on the 28th, Bayonetta 3 for Switch, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare for
6716900	6724900	Xbox, PlayStation, Resident Evil, uh, Village Gold Edition on the same, um, Slime Rancher,
6724900	6734980	Plortable Edition on, uh, October 28th. Um, also, uh, Do Not Open on PlayStation and
6735940	6743540	Cocomelon Play with JJ on October 28th for Switch. All right. We're going to have a few more stories
6743540	6748100	and then we're going to invite your calls, uh, tonight on our Discord, vognetwork.com
6748100	6754260	slash Discord. I'll pop one more. I forgot on, on the 30th, since we'll be airing that day,
6754260	6762740	um, Aeterna Noctis on PlayStation and Switch. All right. Cool. Uh, yeah. So we'll, uh, we'll
6762740	6766660	do a few more stories and then we're going to invite your calls over at vognetwork.com
6766660	6771700	slash Discord. I know there's been some talk, uh, on the Discord as well as Bobby was mentioning
6771700	6776020	on his show tonight about, are we going to be using Twitch guest star capabilities in the future?
6776020	6781060	The answer is more testing needs to be done to make sure that works, especially here. Um,
6781060	6785220	it's one thing for Bobby's show because it's just him. For us, I have to make sure that our guest
6785220	6790500	stars can also hear Dark Sakura and Loki. That is assuming we don't power the whole show through
6790500	6794580	guest star, which is also a possibility. So there's a lot of questions still to ask,
6794580	6799540	uh, as far as making all that work. Um, so for the time being, for now, for the foreseeable future,
6799540	6802740	we're going to keep it with our Discord and we do hope you will join our Discord. I know you're
6802740	6808980	probably in a million Discords. I promise we limit the use of at everyone to extremely minimal.
6808980	6812660	In fact, I can't think of the last time we've used it. So we really try not to send you pings,
6813300	6817220	uh, unless like, again, I can't think of the time in the past.
6817220	6822500	And to be fair, like, you know, it literally takes a second to shut that off anyways,
6822500	6828580	notification wise, like literally every Discord I go, I mute it immediately and I put, I disable
6828580	6832740	all those notifications. It takes like less than a second, especially streamer servers where they
6832740	6836420	need to ping the whole server when they go live. I understand why people to do that. It's important
6836420	6839700	for engagement, but Twitch already tells me when people goes live. So I don't, I don't need it
6839700	6843940	twice. So yeah. So just, I mean, like that shouldn't really be a thing to hold you back.
6843940	6848740	Yeah. All right. Let's move on. Uh, more stories, Loki.
6848740	6853540	Oh boy. Let's talk about Activision. Cause you know, I'm sure all good news. And so I had to
6853540	6858180	look up who this person was because I wasn't really sure at first, cause they didn't seem
6858180	6863940	very professional and good communications, but apparently they are the executive, uh,
6863940	6868580	vice president of corporate affairs and the chief communications officer, meaning that
6868580	6876660	their communication game is 100%. So this is Lulu Cheng, um, Missouri, and, uh, she just
6876660	6882900	joined the Activision team and she's already, already doing a bang up job by Activision
6882900	6888820	standards. So as you may remember, the we've had a few of the departments in there start to
6888820	6895700	unionize and there's been, of course, more talks about unionization as well. So, uh, she thought
6895700	6902660	it would be good to go into the Slack channels of these, um, employees and remind them that,
6902660	6910900	Hey, you know what? Um, you probably shouldn't be talking about, um, you know, you shouldn't
6910900	6916420	be talking about unionization because it's time consuming. It could prevent employees from getting
6916420	6925700	raises until a deal is reached. Um, of course that was met with lots of, um, pushback from
6925700	6931860	the employees as well. Um, this is after they're saying that we'd like a direct communication line
6931860	6935860	with these employees and stuff like that, and we want them to be able to communicate.
6935860	6942500	But of course, obviously they're just trying to stop the unionization is what they're trying to
6942500	6949220	do. Um, and then what's great is, you know, when called out on this, because she's actively
6949220	6954340	tweeting on, um, Twitter, for example, you know, they said, it's very funny to be an executive at
6954340	6959380	a $50 billion company and say, you're genuinely curious if there's some political or something
6959380	6964900	political about opposing unionization. And her takeaway from that is we're actually closer to
6964900	6973860	$60 billion. It's like tone deaf and stupid. Can you be, but apparently very, and that's,
6973860	6979780	which moves you forward at Activision, a video game executive clueless about the industry
6980340	6987060	on my internet. Um, when, when asked for comment about the situation, Activision spoke person,
6987060	6993380	and clearly not the chief communication officer lower down on the list. They're not quite up to
6993380	6997540	the Activision communication standards, but they did put out a statement saying both union and
6997540	7001700	both the union and company are allowed to share their perspectives on the pros and cons
7001700	7006500	of unionization. We deeply respect the right of every eligible employee to decide whether the
7006500	7012020	joining union have their vote counted. Yes. As we make veiled threats to them to prevent them from
7012020	7017620	joining a union. Yes. That that's, that's, that's their, their perspectives. I can't wait to hear
7017620	7022660	what the legal systems perspective is on all of this. So hopefully we'll get a resolution of that
7022660	7030740	pretty soon or Microsoft's perspective on if this person still needs to be employed. Uh, once the
7030740	7036420	merger goes through. All right. I'm sure Microsoft has their own spokespeople, uh, perfectly capable
7036420	7043220	of, um, you know, not tweeting, um, silly things anyway, but Hey, Twitter's probably going to be
7043220	7049460	dead after this week anyway. So what's the matter? Might as well, might as well get in those five
7049460	7056260	star tweets while you still can. I think it's going to happen. I I'm, I'm praying it doesn't
7056260	7061860	and look, I'm just saying it's not who's buying it. That is necessarily the bad news for me,
7061860	7066500	but I've already been very clear on the red line. If they reverse that ban, I'm out period,
7066500	7071940	not sharing the platform with a criminal. That's that's it. I'll be honest. We're sharing it with
7071940	7075540	a lot of other criminals. I know what you mean, but I'm not, not that, not that one.
7076340	7080260	Anyone who voted for that thing, anyone who enabled that thing and participated in the
7080260	7085220	riots against our Capitol. Yeah. They're all criminals. I know. So I just, yeah.
7085220	7088500	Questbuster says it was a great experiment while it lasted. Exactly. You know what,
7088500	7093060	if it's all over after this week, I look back fondly on 15 years and a lot of people that I
7093060	7098180	met and it'll be like, what's the next thing we're going to. We, we, we survived live journal,
7098900	7105140	dead journal, Zanga. We survived MySpace, Friendster. Somehow we're still surviving
7105140	7110020	Facebook. I don't know. I swear to God, I bring up Facebook on mobile. I'll see one post from a
7110020	7115620	friend and then it's suggested posts, sponsored posts, one post from a friend, suggested posts,
7115620	7122260	sponsored posts, one, it's like, why do I put up with this? Seriously? So social media in general.
7123060	7125940	Oh my God. Social media is due for a reckoning and it's coming.
7126740	7132260	So yeah, Bobby says, wait, you see posts from friends? Uh, when I say friends, I mean people
7132260	7136500	I met once at a party when I was intoxicated and we decided it would be a good idea to add each
7136500	7142020	other on Facebook. Uh, and now I see their thoughts on, you know, after they've moved
7142020	7145540	to, um, you know, the, another part of the country, but whatever.
7146500	7150020	I don't do Facebook at all. I honestly, I don't blame you.
7150900	7154980	Sia Tabiri in chat says, am I the only one who survived high five? Yes, you are.
7159380	7166660	I've tried a few other services by the way. I honestly, this is so silly. I miss LiveJournal.
7166660	7171460	I still have my account. I like that pillow fort until I signed up for it. And then it went down
7171460	7179780	for six months, like a week after I made my first post. All right, let's move on. I'm going to go
7179780	7184180	ahead and take this next story, which has to do with star Wars eclipse. And we have some more
7184180	7190020	updates on star Wars eclipse. Um, so, uh, star Wars eclipse is going to be apparently introduced.
7190020	7194500	This is the Quantic Dream RPG in star Wars. If you were not sure what I'm talking about here,
7194500	7200900	a new report from sacred symbols has talked about what is happening. This game was originally
7200900	7204500	announced at the game awards last year. So it's been a few months because you know, the game
7204500	7209540	awards 2022 is going to be here in a few weeks, believe it or not. So usually early December,
7209540	7216100	right? Um, the interesting thing about the sacred symbols report is that the game as far as I can
7216100	7222340	tell is not even in production yet. Yikes, if it's that far out, but all right. Uh, but apparently
7222340	7226820	there's some documents that talk about an overview of the game, main characters and the motivation.
7226820	7230980	The game is being co-written by David Cage and Adam Williams, and they've done other Quantic
7230980	7236180	Dream titles. So that would be a huge surprise. Uh, a character named Sarah is an athletic 30
7236180	7241060	something who is, uh, in a human like race, uh, that is apparently the lead of the game.
7241060	7246820	Uh, but the race in the, uh, that Sarah is from the Zaron is apparently new to the star Wars
7246820	7251380	universe, or at least hasn't been seen in star Wars before. Uh, they pride themselves on political
7251380	7255300	and military aggression and similar to what you'd find elsewhere in star Wars. There's little
7255300	7258980	difference between males and females when it comes to roles and responsibilities, but there's an
7258980	7264580	interesting wrinkle. When a Zaron marries, their nuptials carry interesting military implications
7264580	7272100	as they become one governing unit that works together. What? All right. Come on sci-fi.
7272900	7277300	Uh, this is a problem because Sarah, a fanatical true believer in the violence and criminality
7277300	7282260	regularly demonstrated by her empire is married to a character named Zendo who has a far softer
7282260	7286900	touch. Part of the game seems to evolve around these two characters and their relationship.
7287540	7292820	Alrighty. And lightsabers. And that star Wars eclipse in a nutshell, at least what the early
7292820	7300020	reports are saying. All right. But we'll see. I mean, it's obviously still very early on. And if
7300020	7304260	you, if you think you're waiting a long time for elder scrolls six, just wait on this one.
7305380	7310900	All right. Meanwhile, Loki. Oh, I'm sure you're so excited to talk about this.
7310900	7319300	How them mighty have fallen. Like I remember seeing will, right. Talk about, um,
7320580	7324820	oh gosh, spore way back in the day. The last big game he did.
7325460	7331300	If I don't think he's done a big game since 2008. So that it's been a while. That game really got
7331300	7336100	shit. I don't think that game was great or anything, but it wasn't as bad as people make
7336100	7339380	it out to be. I think it was a fine game. Sports a fight. It shouldn't be, it shouldn't have been
7339380	7345860	his last game he ever made, but the internet ran him off as they usually do. Well now he's back and
7345860	7353620	he's pitching a brand new project that he's working on called Vox verse. It is a game with
7353620	7361620	voxel based characters that walk around and do things. And, um, also there's going to be, uh,
7361620	7368260	apparently it ties to, I think these are based off of NFTs already and you can buy virtual real
7368260	7373300	estate using real money. Now he should be right off the internet for this. I'm just kidding.
7373300	7378820	And I'm just kidding. Yeah. So, uh, apparently, yeah, the vox characters are sold by a crypto
7378820	7387700	firm called, um, gala games. It was spent $25 million funding vox verse. Um, you know,
7388660	7394660	we'll write said that he does. I don't want to really, I don't really want to be in the business
7394660	7402260	of selling NFTs. Um, I have, he says, I, the reason he's interested in blockchains, I have,
7402260	7409540	I want to have a secure transactions for content creators and yeah.
7411060	7416180	It's an interesting perspective. I will give him that. And I can see, you know,
7416180	7420660	he's trying to distance himself from the whole NFT thing. Cause I think even in the interview,
7420660	7425540	like he wasn't saying it, it was the rep other representative that was saying that or whatever.
7425540	7429060	And I think he's kind of trying to distance himself. So like, I will give him,
7431460	7437540	I mean, I don't see myself playing this game. No, I'll give it a chance. Like, just like,
7437540	7442180	I'll say like, you know, okay. Is the game good? Question mark. And if the game's good, then,
7442180	7445460	you know, I'm willing to try playing it and see like what this is all about. But I just,
7446020	7452660	the, all these NFT, none of them are good. None of them. And I'll tell you what, every time
7453380	7458500	I get spam at the OLR account, it's some fucking NFT thing. We're getting tagged in.
7458500	7463060	It's like, again, Intel NFTs can get away from the entire criminality about them.
7464660	7469300	They're never going to be looked at seriously by anyone. So I will say,
7469300	7474420	Will Wright is at least being intelligent in trying to distance himself from that term NFT
7474420	7479620	and instead be like, I want a secure marketplace for creators to be able to transact with each
7479620	7483620	other. And hey, this one's already built, so I'm going to leverage it. Like, so I'm willing
7483620	7493940	to give him at least a shred of like my time, but I just don't, I, you know, seeing the game
7493940	7499060	screenshots and all this early on, it looks so generic though, but whatever. We'll see what it,
7499060	7504980	we'll see when it comes out, if it comes out, even if it ever gets done or the NFTs lose their
7504980	7509460	value. And then they just, you know, they have no money to fund it anymore. It feels like crypto's
7509460	7514660	gone to a place it's never going to recover from anyway. I'm just going to make an NFT of my tongue
7516020	7522580	and sell it to prove a point. You probably could. I'll do it to prove a point. All right.
7522580	7526980	What's the point? You getting money from a sucker? That's the point. Pretty much that's the point.
7527220	7534180	All right. I'm actually going to embed it in very tiny text in the same color. A sucker bought this.
7535620	7541140	All right. Well, let's talk one more story here tonight. A follow-up to a story a couple of weeks
7541140	7546980	ago, we were, when we were talking about Google and Stadia and the final days of Google Stadia.
7546980	7552340	And one question that came up was, well, what about that guy who spent 6,000 hours in Red Dead?
7552340	7557620	Is he screwed? And the answer came out this week. No, that player is not screwed.
7559860	7566580	An update came out from Rockstar Games saying, we are pleased to confirm that all active Stadia
7566580	7572020	players who played Red Dead Online within the last 30 days prior to Stadia announcing their shutdown
7572020	7578340	will be able to carry over any earned RDO dollars, Red Dead Online bucks, gold bars, XP, roll XP,
7578340	7583220	and roll tokens to another existing account on either PC, Xbox One or PlayStation four.
7583220	7588260	Players will just need to have the target game account linked to their Rockstar Social Club
7588260	7591620	account. So honestly, very similar process to what Dark Soccer has been going through with
7591620	7597140	DBD. It's Red Dead Online. That's not a single player game. Yeah. Right. But, but here's the
7597140	7602580	thing. Oh yeah, that's right. It's not a single player game. You're right. There is. No, they're
7602580	7607140	talking about, they're talking about the, their, their, their fantasy books. I thought this was
7607460	7611700	the, okay, well, that's a whole other thing then, is it? Well, the other thing I caught
7611700	7616820	is that it had to be the last 30 days that you played it. So you had to be a regular player of
7616820	7622580	this, or why do they have to limit it to just 30 days? Good, good, good Lord. Probably because
7622580	7628100	that's how far their backups go or something like that. And maybe they only retain data for that
7628100	7635060	long or something. Just with other games, Ubisoft confirmed that they are working with transfers to
7635060	7639780	PC through Ubisoft Connect. Bungie and IO Interactive are also working with Destiny and
7639780	7644660	Hitman players about their games. So, you know, the game makers are trying to, you know, get the
7644660	7650340	Stadia loyal back on their feet on another platform. But sometimes the restrictions are
7650340	7654340	a little silly. I still can't wait to see if Dark Soccer basically got her entire Dead by Daylight
7654340	7659380	collection bought and paid for by Google. Wait a second. I actually have a little bit more
7659380	7663220	about the Dead by Daylight thing. Just a discovery that I've made on two fronts.
7663220	7673380	O-R-L-Y. Okay, so for Epic players, they're reporting that same 30-day deal that the
7673940	7681620	Red Dead folks are seeing. Now, I had, now remember how it was saying that your arc
7681620	7687780	cells were not transferable between one and the other? I had used up as much as I could
7687780	7695860	on my Steam side when I bought some. And then, like I had like 10. And then I've been,
7696980	7703300	I was doing the Rift on my Stadia version, you know, getting those arc cells, spending them to
7703300	7712100	advance the Rift because I want to use them up. And I was left with like 95. And I logged into my
7712660	7721300	Steam one using Boostroid and I checked it and I had 95 arc cells there unless it was a big,
7721300	7727540	you know, coincidence. But I tested something. I got some more arc cells. I spent them. I did
7727540	7733780	stuff with them. I was left with 60. When I logged into my Stadia account, I had 60.
7734420	7738980	Oh, interesting. I have not seen my achievements carried over,
7738980	7742980	but I should probably check my, I'll check my Steam account right now.
7745060	7750820	But I'm hoping that they get the merge thing. I'm actually going to be testing it out
7750820	7760020	probably in a week or so to see if the merge is working. Let me take a look at my Steam library,
7760020	7763940	see what my achievements are. But I'll tell you in a second.
7764260	7770020	All right. Well, that was the last slot of news story we have for the night. So this is the part
7770020	7774100	where we open it up to you all. If you want to participate with our show tonight, I think there
7774100	7776980	were a couple of people that said they wanted to call in. So I'll give them a moment to get
7776980	7783220	over to our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord. If you want to join the green room
7783220	7788020	so you can be on tonight's show, head on over there. Again, that's over at vognetwork.com
7788020	7795780	slash discord. And you can also send us an email. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place
7795780	7801060	to send us an email if you want to talk about something on the show. But as I understand,
7801060	7807780	we have no emails tonight. So you can also tweet us, twitter.com slash O-L-R. I don't think I saw
7807780	7811700	a lot of tweet. I've been fighting out spam every time I go in there. And I bet if I go in there
7811700	7818020	again, there'll be more. And I report every single one. And now hearing that you know who
7818020	7827620	wants to reduce the workforce by 75% so that those reports are going to go literally nowhere. I hope
7827620	7831780	y'all are right. I hope something happens in the last minute to stop that deal because it's a lose
7831780	7836820	lose proposition. He's going to lose money on it when people abandon ship because his ideas for
7836820	7842900	that platform are not smart. But so I did check by the way. And I only have six achievements.
7843620	7852580	So no, well, there's the expert survivor, master survivor, and then the, the old prestige levels.
7853300	7858980	There's still time, we'll see what happens. All right, so let's move on. We do have somebody in
7858980	7862580	the green room waiting to be on the show. So let's welcome them to the show. Hello,
7862580	7864020	you're on orange on radio. Who's this?
7864980	7867620	Greetings one at all is the one and only Rama.
7867620	7871620	Rama, it's so good to hear from you. How are you? Cheers.
7872580	7873940	How is everybody tonight?
7875380	7879700	Good. Yeah, it's it's always a little sad when it's Sunday, because like, oh,
7879700	7884580	it's the end of the weekend. But I'm happy to be here doing or talking to all of you.
7884580	7888740	I'm happy to see that there's even one person who shows up in chat. So there's a lot to be
7888740	7889300	happy about.
7889700	7894100	I'm all about that. And, um, let's just cut right to the chase.
7894900	7899860	Oh, I just I'm also happy that I was completely 100% correct on that band at a three voice actor
7899860	7902020	thing, which I think you're calling it to talk about tonight.
7902980	7905860	Hold on, hold on. I gotta have a little drink about that.
7907540	7912900	They can put please sip some tea. Actually, I have some tea here as well. I will I will sip on my
7912900	7918340	tea. Let's let's spill some tea together. Oops, I spilled a little tea. Let's do that here on
7918740	7919860	here on tonight's OLR.
7921220	7928180	This is the first time I've called in where I had to have to have a drink with what I had to say,
7928180	7933620	because I'm like, I'm gonna need a drink for this. And don't worry, it's just pure coffee,
7933620	7942820	because that's what runs me 24 73 65. Now, I want to talk about how you mentioned people getting
7942820	7947620	mad about voice actors asking for, you know,
7947620	7952260	Oh, yes, the selfies and the autographs. Oh, yes.
7954820	7960100	I'm going to tell you this right now. Those who complain are entitled sobs plain as day.
7962660	7969780	Now, I can tell you, you can go to a comic at one time, you go to a comic convention.
7969780	7974820	It was like it was in grown all the guests there you have to pay for an autograph.
7974820	7981380	You go to an anime convention. The autographs everything were free. Now,
7981380	7988020	you go to a Gen Con of convention, not Gen Con itself, but a convention that covers
7988020	7994740	anime, sci fi, fancy all of that. It used to be where if they were strictly anime,
7995460	8002660	free autographs, everyone had to pay. It's changed. Now it's like most conventions regardless
8003300	8008100	of the genre that it is, the guests appear, and you have to pay for the autographs.
8008100	8014020	And the weebs are crying about it because they feel the money that they have spent on getting
8014020	8019460	to the con buying their ticket, getting their hotel room and buying all that swag or their
8019460	8026340	favorite anime or video game. But they don't want to shut out a $20 bill to get an autograph by that
8026340	8033300	actor who voiced their favorite anime or video game. One of my close friends is a voice actor.
8034180	8041460	I saw him at a convention. I got two autographs from him. And I bought them. I did not ask for
8041460	8048340	free. I've known him for 10 plus years. I still bought them because I'm not just a friend. I'm a
8048340	8053700	supporter of his work. So you don't go to a Starbucks your friend works at and say, Hey,
8053700	8057460	give me free coffee because you work here. So I deserve free coffee.
8057460	8059780	My friends used to give me free coffee when they worked at Starbucks.
8059780	8061460	You're not helping. You're not helping.
8061460	8064820	I know I'm not helping. But it's a fair point.
8064820	8070500	It's a difference. If I say that to you, come by, I'll hook you up. That's a different story.
8070500	8077300	Yeah, no. And do you know what? I have been very hashtag blessed. Because when I say hashtag
8077300	8080740	blessed, I don't make it sound like I'm getting on the stage thanking God for my award and that
8080740	8086820	whole thing. I'm very hashtag blessed to have met so many diverse people throughout the nation,
8086820	8092820	thanks to OLR, that there are people that have hooked me up with things. I don't want to flex.
8092820	8100660	But I'm just going to say, I really am thankful for the opportunities that doing something like
8100660	8101620	this. My work discount for friends.
8103300	8105220	People from the show, people I met through the show.
8105220	8108820	It's too bad that I spent 18 years in health insurance and couldn't get anyone a discount,
8108820	8112980	but it is what it is. So I don't work there anymore, which is why I'm willing to say that.
8112980	8117700	Anyway, also real quick aside, I just want to say I don't usually acknowledge these live at the end
8117700	8123460	of the show. I usually talk about the gift subs and the biddies. But there is a hype train going
8123460	8128260	on in the chat right now. And Bobby Black Wolf donated five gift subs, which was very kind of
8128260	8134820	him to do. And then an anonymous person decided to one up him and do 10 gift subs. So whoever did
8134820	8139380	that, that was very kind of you. Thank you. All of you. I mean, whether it was one gift sub,
8139380	8144900	100 biddies, 500 biddies, all of you, just the fact that you do that and allow us to
8144900	8147940	be a legitimate business, putting this on and pay our legal fees every year,
8148500	8153700	sponsor conventions, things like that. I just want to take a minute to say, just fucking thank you.
8153700	8157540	Like, I mean that so much. Thank you. Thanks, Ram. I just saw you chip in there too.
8157540	8158420	Sorry about that one.
8159620	8163700	Get your emotes. What are we up to now? I haven't covered up. What is it? Level?
8163780	8167060	Oh, fuck. We're level five. Damn. All right. Thank you all.
8167060	8171780	I've seen a level 13 hype train. It'd be great if we can make one.
8171780	8173780	Oh, nice try. All right.
8175780	8177060	You can't blame a girl for trying.
8177060	8181780	I know you can't blame anyone for trying. All right. I, you know what? And even if you can't
8181780	8188340	afford, I cannot stress this enough. Y'all being here is donation enough for me. And especially
8188340	8192980	those of you that spread the word on social media and that sort of thing. I see that and just thank
8192980	8200900	you for all of that. I mean, the money's nice too, but I just want to be clear. All right. Anyway,
8202420	8206260	let's move on. I'm sorry, Ram. I interrupted a thought of yours while
8207300	8207860	Quite all right.
8209140	8215540	And I'll admit I was one of those. I was kind of pissed. I had to pay for autographs because I was,
8215540	8221780	it's not because I was entitled. It's what I'm used to is to animate culture, but you have to
8221780	8226900	learn to adapt and move on. Yes. It kind of sucks. You have to pay for an autograph,
8226900	8232580	but you know what that means? That means the voice actor will end up getting a lower
8233460	8239140	one-time cost for period con appearance, but they able to make more money on the autographs,
8239140	8247700	which allows the con to get more guests. That's true. That is true because, um, guests have to
8247700	8253300	have that minimum guarantee of how much they sell and a con can't get a big name guest that
8253300	8258500	they can't guarantee that they're going to allow that. Because if the celeb doesn't make that money,
8258500	8263700	the con has to reimburse them basically like, sorry, you came out here and didn't get your
8264740	8268260	multi-thousand dollar minimum, depending on who it is, it can be a multi-thousand dollar minimum.
8269300	8272900	So yeah, anyway, not to do too much inside baseball, but it's just one of those things
8272900	8282660	where it's like, if you, you know, again, if you think Helena Taylor was being underpaid at 20,000
8282660	8286260	or whatever it was they offered her to do Bayonetta, then fucking don't complain when
8286260	8291780	she charges you 40 bucks for a selfie. You're giving her the money you believe she's entitled to.
8294260	8299860	Rob, at this point, the hell with insider baseball, the people need to know. It's gotten to that
8299940	8306100	point. Yeah. It's got, let's go back to the, uh, the height of the pandemic. You had to open up
8306100	8310180	the books and tell people, this is why the concept happened. This is why this is not happening.
8310980	8316580	It's becoming public knowledge and people need to know there are more people, more voice actors
8316580	8322740	talking about, they're not getting paid enough. You know, I know voice actors who are Twitch
8322740	8327700	streaming, YouTube streaming. I mean, because in a way, because of the pandemic, we got more
8327700	8332020	critical role and that was started by Matt Mercer and a bunch of other voice actors.
8332020	8335860	Can I say as a quick aside, I owe you 75 cents because I've used the term
8335860	8338820	pandemic three times this week. So I now owe you three quarters.
8339380	8343940	Actually, you don't owe me three quarters. Those, those three quarters want to my best friends,
8343940	8347700	Patty and Steph. Okay. Two of the most ladies ever.
8347700	8350980	I miss Patty love Patty. I have, I met Steph.
8351780	8356020	Oh no, this is a different Patty and Steph. Oh, okay. Oh, I thought it was okay. Well,
8356260	8361060	I'm still going to declare my love for Patty. Okay. So I just, I did that one's on the house.
8363060	8367380	I'm sure other Patty and Steph, I would love to any, any friend of Rama's a friend of mine.
8367940	8370900	Well, they are the ones that made the glow in the dark fog patches.
8371780	8377940	Oh, okay. Then I do like them. Yes. Jamie knows Patty and Steph because they,
8377940	8380740	they do Debbie delight together. Sometimes if I'm not mistaken.
8381540	8388340	I, yeah, I'm starlet. I know them starlet creation.
8388340	8394260	They're absolutely delightful people. We haven't actually got, no, we, I did with starlight too,
8394260	8400100	which I don't sure which of them that is, but we did play, um, a little bit of Debbie together is
8400100	8407140	actually, no, it fell apart, but we tried to, but delightful people and, and regulars in my stream.
8407140	8411380	Yeah, for sure. And anyway, sorry, back to the, back to the topic of hands. Sorry,
8411380	8416340	we didn't know it's cool, but I'll always give a shout out to great people. But, um, the, uh,
8416340	8419780	you know, we were talking a little bit last week, we were reflecting on Twitch con, which was two
8419780	8423780	weeks ago. Right. And we were reflecting on the drag show, which was, you know, really a highlight
8423780	8429460	of Twitch con for, especially those of us in the LGBTQ plus community, you know, is very, um,
8430740	8435220	very, uh, great for us. And the fact that they were highlighting performers who didn't make
8435220	8440420	their careers off of drag race or what have you. And again, again, I have nothing but love in my
8440420	8445220	heart for those people, but I love that they spotlight people that again, we're not able to
8445220	8451620	perform in local clubs. And so they turned to Twitch to, you know, get that income that they
8451620	8457060	were missing from doing the club stuff and really built up a international following on a place like
8457060	8462420	Twitch. So, yeah, I mean, during the pandemic, a lot of, you know, voice actors and people that
8462420	8466820	were, you know, out jobs and so forth, we're, we're turning to Twitch to do that. And that's
8466820	8472740	why Twitch has really exploded, you know, in the last few years. So. Yep. Yep. All right. Anyway,
8472740	8476420	Rama, I gotta let you go. Cause we have one more caller waiting, but, um, any other thoughts before
8476420	8484180	we let you go? Pay people for what they're worth. And if you have, and if you don't feel your worth
8484180	8489300	is being paid, there are other ways of handling the situation with tact and respect. And another
8489300	8493460	way I might phrase that pay people what they're worth, but pay me first. I'm just kidding.
8494820	8503540	Just kidding. Girl. And that's all I have to say about that. You all take care of yourselves and
8503540	8508340	each other. It's always a delight to hear from you. Uh, I hope it's not too cold there. You're
8508340	8513780	wearing a jacket indoors. It must be very cold there. Something like that. It's like basically,
8514580	8521060	you know how there's four seasons in New York city, there's about 12 and fall just went to
8521060	8524740	hell with you. I'm out and winter's like, yo, what's good. And I'm just like,
8526260	8530020	Rama, you ever want to come to California for an extended visit? Look at that nice comfy couch.
8530020	8533620	Look at that nice comfy couch behind me here on the, the, uh, voice keys network.
8533620	8539220	I have, I have a full on height of bed. Uh, wait, that couch used to be mine.
8539940	8546660	I don't know. I don't know if I've mentioned this, but my job gives us mandatory three
8546660	8552660	weeks paid vacation and two weeks out of the year at the end of the year, the office is closed.
8552660	8556100	I've kind of canceled plans to go to Florida. So anything's plausible.
8558180	8560740	Come visit. We'll do, we'll do, we'll go do something fun.
8561860	8564500	I'll take you to a gay bar. We'll have the best time. I assure you.
8565380	8568820	But I want you to know it's been at least three,
8568820	8572180	four years since I've been to a gay bar. We'll take you to the Depot.
8573140	8577940	We will drive down and say hello to Victoria. Yes.
8580420	8584980	That's what I'm talking about right there. And then we'll go to see Victoria,
8584980	8589780	but I had stuff to do. All right. Now we really have to let you go to get to this other cause
8589780	8592900	now we're talking about people that the listeners are like, who the fuck are these people? All right,
8593620	8600420	have a good one. My friend. All right, let's get to another call. We're going to bring someone
8600420	8603620	else in here real quick. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
8604340	8605540	Hello, Shane.
8606180	8608340	Shane. It's been a while since we've heard from you. How are you?
8609300	8610660	I'm fine.
8610660	8612100	All right. Uh, what's on your mind tonight?
8612740	8619460	Pokemon as usual. I mean, of course now in all fairness, I talked about Pokemon earlier in the
8619460	8623940	show. So if you're, if you're here to yell at me for not bringing up Pokemon, uh, you should have
8623940	8629780	been here earlier. Uh, no, it doesn't matter when you talk about it's when I talk about it,
8629780	8633940	that counts. All right. How are we feeling about gen nine, Shane?
8633940	8638500	Oh, so excited. So excited. So they did, uh, I mean, I don't know what you talked about,
8638500	8643380	so I'm like, I just briefly mentioned the media tour this week for influencers and stuff that they
8643380	8647460	were showing the first hour of the game or whatever it is. Oh, it's not even the first
8647460	8652420	hour. They just got to play an hour. It kind of threw them in randomly. But, um,
8653380	8658740	the thing I want to talk about, the most important thing is the music. Well, it's not the most
8658740	8663060	important thing, but it's the most important thing really to come out of this like influencer media
8663060	8669380	tour. And I sent you a link so you could play the little clip that, uh, is awesome.
8669380	8673940	I can, but the problem is, um, dark soccer and Loki and yourself won't be able to hear it. Just
8673940	8675780	the listeners will be able to hear it when I do that.
8676420	8679460	Oh, well, all right. Everybody should still hear it.
8679460	8682980	All right. Well, forgive me for a moment. Cause I just need to change the shot real quick. Cause
8682980	8686500	I'm going to open a private discord screen. So I don't want to show, cause I don't know,
8686500	8689460	Lord knows what else we've been talking about in there. So let me just pull this up real,
8689460	8697460	uh, real quick. Um, and then I can, oops. Well, I guess we were talking about PT. Weren't we,
8697460	8701540	um, hold on. Let me try that again. Way to make that private.
8701780	8708100	Yeah. After going through all that. And I love that. What a shock after, after all that, it's
8708100	8711940	like, Oh, the, the secret conversation, Robin Shay, we're having, we're about PT. All right.
8714500	8716900	Let's see. All right. So I'm going to play this. Hold on. Let me, uh,
8718100	8722180	so this is music that we need to hear this battle wild Pokemon music. And I have never
8722180	8728260	heard this before, by the way. Yes. So wait, I'll set it up. So it's the music that plays
8729220	8734820	when you run into a Pokemon in the wild and it doesn't sound like Pokemon music there. That's
8734820	8739540	my, that's my setup. Okay. Let me, uh, I'm going to check out a little bit with apologies to dark
8739540	8743300	soccer and Loki. Cause we don't have that. It's like 10 seconds. It's nothing.
8752180	8755620	Are we going to get copyright strike? Cause I'm playing this music. I need to talk over it. Don't
8756260	8759140	I? Um, Oh God, these Pokemon are so cute though.
8761380	8765940	That's I mean, it's a good song, but I'm not sitting here going like, Oh my God,
8765940	8768820	is this, is this a song I need to hear? That's kind of like the funky little.
8769380	8776420	Yeah. So this is nothing like how it's, it's like jazzy persona five-y sort of like,
8776420	8778340	okay. I see what you mean. I see what you mean.
8778340	8782180	Yeah. No, it's amazing. It's absolutely amazing.
8782180	8786420	It's nowhere near the level of the gym battle song in the last game. That's,
8786420	8791300	that was, that was S tier music. That was S tier music for Pokemon was the gym.
8791300	8797060	No, it was. You're right. And this is like S plus. Um, and same with like,
8797060	8805540	I own those theme is really good too. I just like having many games with the same sort of,
8805540	8810820	with the exception of like, you know, the gym music from last gen, like very similar sounding
8812180	8818420	I don't know, everything in the game. It's just, it's really refreshing that they, they put like
8818420	8823620	a really good piece of music that kind of bucks the trend as something you're going to hear quite
8823620	8830180	often. And it's just, it's so good. It's going to make that thousand plus hours I'm going to spend
8830180	8834660	in each game. Like probably not as monotonous as it could have been.
8835620	8842500	Okay, but what song is better that song? Or I was waiting to see if you'd even let me say the
8842500	8847300	alternative before you just say that song. Okay, what song is better that song or close in the
8847300	8855220	distance from home as he for 14? They're not even like, you can't compare that. That's like
8855220	8864180	comparing. It's like comparing Del Taco to a flame and y'all. It's like, they're both really good in
8864260	8871620	their own ways. But like, you just can't because I don't always want a filet mignon. Sometimes I need
8871620	8876100	like a crunchy. Sometimes you want you sometimes you want a taco and crinkle fries. I understand.
8876100	8883300	Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I don't know this. Like, I didn't really expect previews to drop this week.
8883300	8888260	It looks amazing. Everybody that played it. I guess there were some like technical issues,
8888260	8894340	but it's a Pokemon game. What do you expect? But people just were like, genuinely happy. And
8894340	8898740	a lot of the things that they couldn't talk about made them very happy, which annoys the crap out of
8898740	8904740	me. But whatever. It's fine. I understand. I understand playing a game you really enjoy,
8904740	8907940	and you really want to talk about it, but you can't. I understand that very well this week.
8907940	8915700	Yes. But I was gonna say the icon on your Discord is Quaxley, one of the starter Pokemon,
8915700	8920660	but we still don't know what Quaxley's final form looks like. And how nervous are you on a scale
8920660	8929220	one to 10? 40 billion. Like, I don't want to get screwed over like I did with Popplio. And I just
8929220	8936340	feel like I'm going to. And I don't really have a true backup yet. Like, at least with Popplio,
8936340	8942740	Rowlet was great. Like, Decidueye is awesome. But I mean, from the leaked stuff that I won't
8942740	8948740	talk about, I don't really know what I'm gonna do. Okay. What's your dream? Like,
8948740	8953620	if you got to design Quaxley's third form, what would what would the dream evolution look like
8953620	8962820	for you? Um, I say punk rock doc duck. Dog. He just gets from duck to dog. It's clearly
8962820	8969860	going to be a fighting type humanoid duck. I mean, that's, that's obviously the perfect choice.
8969860	8975300	It would look like Donald Duck, but with a fatter ass. I have seen a lot of Howard,
8975300	8979540	the duck Howard, the duck is the No, because that scared me as a kid. I can't have that.
8981380	8986740	No, I I've seen a lot of fan art, like speculation on what it could be. And I've seen a lot of really
8986740	8994740	good matador designs. And I like that. I think if you're going to stick with like the Spain
8994740	9000500	influence, I think that would be really cool. Okay, I like that. That would be pretty cool.
9000500	9008260	So yeah. All right. A malador because mallard matador doing something like that,
9008260	9015780	or a pirate named like swash duckler. You just came up with that a malador like you
9015780	9020020	could literally work at Pokemon making Pokemon with talent like that. That's really good. I
9020100	9025540	like way better than the job I'm doing now. So I'm bored. I'll make pun names all day long.
9029860	9033140	Oh, that's so good. I can't wait for this and Silent Hill. Even if you crapped on it,
9033140	9037060	it still looks I didn't crap on it. We talked to actually pretty positively about it. What
9037940	9042340	do you what do you do? What are you lying about? I was in the bath. I don't know. I'm just gonna
9042340	9047060	say what I assume happened. You know what they say about people that assume
9047060	9052660	I'm about to set the record gay right now. Uh, Shane, is the new James hot or not?
9054180	9059460	Depends on the like scene now. Now who's backtracking now who's backtracking?
9059460	9068020	I never I never agreed with you fully. Like, I just said I showed you his Instagram. And I said
9068020	9074260	that sometimes he has wonky hair. And there's a couple times where his face is a little strange,
9074260	9079700	but sometimes it looks fine. So it's okay. And they still have time to fix it because we don't
9079700	9085940	have a release year even. So that's true. That's true, too. Yeah. And that and man,
9085940	9091140	this week was good for horror games and resonable for remake, which I've never played, but I somehow
9091140	9097540	pre ordered the collector's edition. I don't know what happened there. Um, it's it's very exciting,
9097540	9106100	like, three, four ish Silent Hills. Yeah. Dog. Oh, do you think it's a misdirect?
9106740	9111620	I hope it is. But also, I didn't even know that was a thing until I saw a clip about it. I was
9111620	9115860	like, I would have gone in ignorant and like, Oh, just part of the scenery. I didn't know that.
9116420	9121620	In the original one, he was somebody you could help. And so I better be able to help him or like
9121620	9124660	parry something with my gun. Like, I don't know, ever killed him.
9124980	9129300	Rocket. Oh, my God. Something just occurred to me. We talked about Silent Hill. And now we're
9129300	9135620	talking about this dog. What if in the movie, we find a random Shiba Inu running around?
9136420	9141940	That that would be the dog ending after credits. That would be the best post credit like like
9141940	9144980	Marvel could never with a post credit sequence that good.
9146660	9153060	I nominate my Shiba Inu puppy. Although there there is I did not watch the entire 90 minute
9153060	9157540	presentation. But apparently there was merchandising, merchandising. And apparently
9157540	9164660	there is a like dog ending like, like, whole setup you can actually buy. And so I was like,
9164660	9167380	Okay, that is pretty cute. Did you already pre order it?
9168100	9169060	No, no.
9170420	9171460	Because I need this.
9171460	9173380	Yes. Somebody find the link, please. And drop it.
9174500	9177700	I'll be honest, I did not see it up for pre order yet because I did go to their
9178340	9186900	site shortly after the transmission ended. And I saw, like the stuffed animal Shiba Inu.
9186900	9190500	And I did not see I think they said it was a coin bank. I did not see that.
9190500	9192980	As Joe and Matt says it isn't the discord somewhere. So yeah,
9193700	9198340	actually, since we brought up Silent Hill, let me ask you real quick about that. Because I know
9198340	9202260	you're you love Silent Hill. And you know, you brought a lot of those games to my attention, too.
9202820	9208340	Um, I'm curious your thoughts on Silent Hill F and the kind of very different direction they
9208340	9209300	appear to be going with that.
9210420	9218180	It's hard to say because they, I mean, all they did was show a little CG with no context,
9218180	9224420	except we do know it's it's set in Japan, and it's set in the 1960s. Yeah. So I mean,
9224420	9228660	they can literally do anything I was talking with one of my friends about this, who was like,
9228660	9234180	Oh, but it has to be in Silent Hill to be a Silent Hill. Like, four wasn't in Silent Hill
9234180	9239460	or was in Ashfield. Like, you just need somebody with a connection there. And who's to say there's
9239460	9246980	no connection, like somebody visited? Or I've seen people say like, the white Claudia flower comes
9246980	9251460	from this maybe. So there's like, a lot of different ways you could connect it and it's
9251460	9255700	still fine. I feel like it's gonna tie into the lore somehow, ultimately, but I like the look and
9255700	9260420	the aesthetic they're going for, even though yes, we didn't see one actual frame of game. So yeah,
9260420	9265620	and whatever the developer, the only frame of reference I have for them is Resident Evil
9265620	9273060	reverse. So I'm a little concerned. But then I mean, I could say the same for Bloomberg team,
9273060	9277380	or I could, I don't know the other two studio. Oh, wait, one's dead by daylight. And then the other
9277380	9281860	is, well, it's like four different studios behaviors, just one of them. So yeah, that's
9281860	9286180	true. But I really quickly want to say thank you as you 100 Matt actually dropped the link in chat
9286180	9293540	to the coin bank. So it's Silent Hill to Enu. And I guess is the official name of that ending coin
9293540	9299940	back bank statue. So but the price is TBD, it is going to come out 2023 in Japan, but it does say
9299940	9305620	other areas TBD. So they're planning to release at least in other areas. So that's pretty cool.
9305620	9310100	But yeah, it was tweeted out with most important Silent Hill announcement and, you know,
9310100	9316580	understandable relatable. That's just like the the pyramid. They showed at the beginning of
9316580	9321300	this merchandise thing is really amazing. But it's like, here's all the Japanese information.
9321300	9327060	It may come somewhere else. But maybe Oh, no, yet. I'm like, man, I would love that.
9327700	9332820	I need this. I know I kind of wanted to anyway, I'm Shane, we're about at the end of showtime. So
9332820	9338020	do you have any other final thoughts for us before we let you go? No. Okay, well, then,
9338020	9346820	bye. Bye. All right. Thank you, Shane, as always, for coming on the show. Let's wrap it all up here
9346820	9351540	tonight at Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you all, of course, for listening to our show. We appreciate

9374660	9378580	everybody's final thoughts and wrap it all up. So DarkSakura, I'll let you go first because I
9378580	9384020	know you're streaming some Debbie tonight. Don't forget the momathon on November 1st.
9384020	9391220	Help me help out my mom. Same name, DarkSakura underscore O-L-R. You're on Twitch. I really
9391220	9394980	appreciate any help you can help me with my mom. You're also very smart to do that on what is
9394980	9402340	payday for a lot of people. Well, I picked a day that I was off work. Fair enough. All right.
9402340	9407220	Later taters. Bye DarkSakura. Have a good one. All right. Loki, your final thoughts for us tonight.
9407940	9413380	Trees are hard to make. What's hard to make? Trees. Oh, trees are hard to make. You have
9413380	9418500	to wait a long time for them to grow. Especially cyber trees. They are very hard to design.
9419300	9424820	Uh, my final thought is, uh, next week is Halloween weekend. I hope you all have a fun
9424820	9428260	because let's be real. Halloween is on a Monday. So most of you are going to do your, you know,
9428260	9432660	spooky shit on a Saturday. So I hope you all have fun. I will be hosting a now sold out
9432660	9436580	performance of Rocky Horror Picture Show here in Sacramento. I'm very excited about it. Uh,
9436580	9441940	and I hope whatever you all are doing for your spooky Saturday day, I hope you all have fun.
9441940	9446740	Be safe. Uh, make good choices. If you make bad ones, at least know the risks.
9447300	9451540	Uh, that's it for us tonight here at Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you all so much for watching
9451540	9457780	the show. Um, have a great week and we will see you next time to talk about, uh, all the
9457780	9461300	late breaking news. Uh, I'm sure again, cause it's been a lot of that in October. It's been
9461300	9464900	late breaking news, October. So have a good one everybody. We'll see you in seven days.
9464900	9466100	Have a wonderful week. Good night.
