WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.780
I hope you have broadband and aren't close to your download cap because you're going

00:12.780 --> 00:16.860
to be downloading an entire quadruple layer Blu-ray XL disc's worth of content before

00:16.860 --> 00:20.620
you can play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2-2. Start the game a few hours before you want

00:20.620 --> 00:24.220
to play or plan on doing something else while you wait. The amount of data on the physical

00:24.220 --> 00:27.980
disc? 72 megs. Why even manufacture the disc?

00:27.980 --> 00:31.220
This is the First World Gamers Only Update. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts,

00:31.220 --> 00:34.660
Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.660
Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.660 --> 00:44.460
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:44.460 --> 00:52.680
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode

00:52.680 --> 01:02.280
number 935 of our program for tonight, October the 30th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and

01:02.280 --> 01:07.520
I am joined every week here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle,

01:07.520 --> 01:12.960
games and stuff with my co-host, sadly not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers,

01:12.960 --> 01:17.120
although I just saw her pop up into chat, but she's not joining us live tonight. You've

01:17.120 --> 01:20.260
probably caught on the past couple of weeks. She's been dealing with some issues with her

01:20.260 --> 01:26.900
voice. I'm not at liberty to say all the nuts and bolts of what's going on unless she wants to say

01:26.900 --> 01:31.660
in chat, but I do know she is on doctor ordered rest. She'll be fine, but she's under doctor's

01:31.660 --> 01:38.260
orders not to do too much talking. So doing a three hour podcast is a little bit much. However,

01:38.260 --> 01:42.660
she will be joining us in a prerecorded Classic Game of the Week segment a little later in the

01:42.660 --> 01:48.460
program. So in the meantime, though, of course, we are joined every week by Techmaster Loki. Hi,

01:48.460 --> 01:54.820
Loki. Hey, how's it going? Good. How are you? Pretty good. Good. Of course, we do tape live

01:54.820 --> 02:01.860
every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network. Nine o'clock Eastern,

02:01.860 --> 02:06.980
six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And you can join us live or you can

02:06.980 --> 02:11.580
barge on in the room as it appears. DarkSakura's just done throwing throwing off my scenes a

02:11.580 --> 02:18.380
little bit. Hi. I just wanted to come in long enough to say hi to everybody and say I'm still

02:18.380 --> 02:24.660
alive. Good. Yeah. The tone would have been much different if you weren't I'm not sure there would

02:24.660 --> 02:31.860
have been a show tonight. Happy Halloween. Hi. Happy Halloween. It's a it's a mess over here. I

02:31.860 --> 02:38.820
have to paint a gravestone at some point. Spooky. So did you want to give a little more insight

02:38.820 --> 02:47.340
what's going on? Yeah. So I went to ear nose and throat specialist and I got to see my larynx. I

02:47.340 --> 02:55.460
took a picture of it. I've got inflammation on my larynx and there is the flap that's like right

02:55.460 --> 03:05.260
above it in the neck has got some damage to it, something that can heal up. So on Wednesday, I

03:05.260 --> 03:15.100
speak to a speech therapist to see if I'm fine to come off the voice rest or if they need me to

03:15.220 --> 03:22.020
continue or do reduce talking. So like I haven't even been doing my Dead by Daylight streams. I've

03:22.020 --> 03:33.420
just been playing RPGs because I don't have to talk. So I I've been gesturing a lot. But right

03:33.420 --> 03:40.460
now, this is about as good as my voice has sounded in the last couple of weeks. If I keep talking,

03:40.820 --> 03:46.900
it will, of course, vanish into the abyss. Well, obviously, you probably just need to keep resting

03:46.900 --> 03:52.540
it and hopefully everything goes all right. And, you know, we look forward to hearing how your

03:52.540 --> 03:57.500
recovery keeps going. Yeah. And I'm not on cam because I'm totally in my pajamas. It's totally

03:57.500 --> 04:04.380
fine. All right. Well, thank you for hopping in and saying hello. We'll hear from you through the

04:04.380 --> 04:08.500
magic of prerecorded bits a little later in the show. Hey, I put a lot of work into that, so

04:08.500 --> 04:16.140
people better like it. All right. All right. All right. Where was I? Loki, yes. When I was

04:16.140 --> 04:21.420
introducing you, I was going to say, because, again, we do tape live, we have the video and

04:21.420 --> 04:27.860
sometimes you play things behind you on video. And I actually got really excited when I saw what

04:27.900 --> 04:32.220
game you had going behind you tonight. But for the sake of the podcast listeners who can't see the

04:32.220 --> 04:36.580
game or for those watching live who don't know what it is, can you tell us what you have playing

04:36.580 --> 04:42.660
behind you and why? I have Sim Ant playing behind me. And the reason for that is because they don't

04:42.660 --> 04:51.940
have an Ant-Man video game because a new trailer came out for Quantumania. So, OK, nice, nice. No,

04:51.940 --> 04:57.340
I loved Sim Ant. That was one of my favorite games for sure. Yeah, it wasn't one that I played, but

04:57.340 --> 05:04.740
my friends had it. So, OK, nice. I also want to just kind of give a weird like FYI. So like some

05:04.740 --> 05:09.380
of my OBS settings got all messed up because I made a transition with my personal streams, which

05:09.380 --> 05:16.380
share with the same account to do some Spotify stuff that doesn't get cease and desisted on my

05:16.380 --> 05:20.740
personal streams. It's nothing here for using for Orange Islands right now. But my point is a lot of my

05:20.740 --> 05:25.340
sound settings got screwed up and I had to redo everything. So please let me know if the sound

05:25.340 --> 05:32.060
seems off to you and I will try my best to fix it. Like for me, I hear Loki quiet. But when I see the

05:32.060 --> 05:37.140
little meters that I'm looking, he's like probably at a level that's almost above where I'm at. So

05:37.460 --> 05:42.060
I'm assuming everything is fine. Yeah. OK, Bobby Blackwell, he would say something if it was off and

05:42.060 --> 05:47.700
he says sounds fine for me. So I'm going with it. So it's just the wonders of having to change

05:47.700 --> 05:55.100
things every now and then. That's for sure. So. All right, let's see, I guess we'll get right into

05:55.100 --> 05:59.140
our kickoff topic for tonight. Loki, did you want to tell us about what's going on? And I got to

05:59.140 --> 06:04.940
say, there isn't like for being Halloween week and everything. There is a lot of news this week, I

06:04.940 --> 06:06.580
gotta say in the gaming world. So

06:07.020 --> 06:11.620
we're in the middle of the fourth, well, almost the end of the fourth quarter, actually. So there's

06:11.620 --> 06:13.300
not going to be a whole ton.

06:13.620 --> 06:16.740
Well, but well, I mean, there's some big game releases still coming because

06:16.740 --> 06:17.180
November

06:17.180 --> 06:23.220
I keep all the secrets for one more month. So then we can release them all for the Game Wars

06:23.220 --> 06:27.340
Game Wars. I'll say there's always, you know, big announcements Game Wars. There's still some big

06:27.340 --> 06:31.860
game releases coming. You know, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is a huge release that a lot of people

06:31.860 --> 06:38.100
are looking forward to. God of War Ragnarok is on the horizon. Although apparently it leaked. So look

06:38.100 --> 06:44.740
out internet for spoilers because they're out there. So that's on the horizon. And of course,

06:44.740 --> 06:49.420
this week Bayonetta 3, a game that was in the news a lot the last couple weeks, maybe not for the

06:49.420 --> 06:54.580
reasons it wanted to be. But, you know, I won't get into that now. But I know a lot of people are

06:54.580 --> 06:58.740
looking forward to Bayonetta 3 and that's finally out, you know, so so we are getting into that

06:58.740 --> 07:02.460
time of year where all the games are releasing. But because of that, we just don't have a lot of

07:02.460 --> 07:06.860
news about what the future holds as far as you know, games go. There's a few things here and

07:06.860 --> 07:11.380
there. But I just noticed generally when I was, you know, looking at the show world tonight, in a

07:11.380 --> 07:14.980
way I was kind of like, you know what, if Dark Sakura has to miss a week, I don't know if we had

07:14.980 --> 07:19.180
enough stories for all three of us. If she was here this week, I'd be we'd be really, really

07:19.180 --> 07:26.060
pushing it. But if you all have any, you know, questions, comments, tonight is the night for

07:26.060 --> 07:32.780
tangent trains. So by all means, shout them out in our Twitch channel over twitch.tv slash vog

07:32.820 --> 07:38.700
network. So yeah, and I see Fanara is in chat as well. I'm glad to see you're doing better Fanara

07:39.700 --> 07:46.420
who's also kind of resting up right now. Fifth Dream in chat says OMG, less than three weeks to

07:46.420 --> 07:54.780
Pokemon SV. I'm gonna pee. Now the question is Fifth Dream. Are you getting Pokemon S or Pokemon

07:54.780 --> 07:56.540
V? And of course, I mean, are you getting scarlet?

07:56.540 --> 07:58.820
Are you going number one? Are you going number two?

08:01.820 --> 08:05.340
Maybe that'll be Gen 10. Pokemon poo and Pokemon pee.

08:07.740 --> 08:13.340
They can't say pee and poo. They'll have to like come up with names that are not quite that but you

08:13.340 --> 08:13.660
know.

08:16.580 --> 08:21.140
Fifth Dream says violet all the way. You're not really a Pokemon person though. Are you Loki?

08:23.540 --> 08:34.540
Casual like the last one I played was let's play Pikachu and me is it was okay. I finished it. My

08:34.540 --> 08:41.300
son played the last one. And we'll probably get this one too. I buy him a lot of like the switch

08:41.300 --> 08:50.100
games. I got him hooked on Enter the Gungeon though. I'm a good father. So you know, I was

08:50.100 --> 08:56.340
pleased to see him playing that. But yeah, it also picked up since it's not my game week, it's his

08:56.980 --> 09:02.020
picked up the new Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope game. So he's been playing that too.

09:02.020 --> 09:08.340
Nice. All right, cool. Cool. Let's see. Also looking in our chat room at some other comments

09:08.340 --> 09:14.740
here. Mike Deaf says I still haven't decided what version to get. Yeah, I was asked about it this

09:14.740 --> 09:21.140
weekend, which one I'm getting. And I'm like, I think I'm getting Scarlet because like 90% of

09:21.140 --> 09:26.180
people I know are getting Violet because of the hot professor. And I do appreciate a hot professor,

09:26.180 --> 09:30.420
but I also appreciate having the version that has the exclusives everyone else wants. So I can be

09:30.420 --> 09:36.420
popular. So I might get Pokemon Scarlet just for that reason. And actually I like the ghost dog.

09:36.420 --> 09:43.460
I like the prehistoric professor too, to be honest. So no, I don't know who it is when you

09:43.460 --> 09:48.980
say ghost dog. We still don't know the final Evos of the base Pokemon in the game. There's still a

09:48.980 --> 09:55.140
lot to look forward to. Let's see. Jaskren in chat in response to the question which Pokemon version

09:55.140 --> 10:00.980
are you getting says Pokemon gun. Remember those memes when we had Pokemon sword and shield and we

10:00.980 --> 10:07.700
never got Pokemon gun? Where where that's a great goal. Where is Pokemon gun? It's just there. It's

10:07.700 --> 10:13.140
not going to be Pokemon gun. It'll be Pokemon trebuchet. And it's just not out yet. They have

10:13.140 --> 10:23.620
to do that. Let's see. I also E3VL in chat says I wish they stuck with one version like Arceus.

10:23.620 --> 10:29.540
And I honestly, truth, I'm almost more excited about a sequel for that game. Well,

10:30.420 --> 10:36.420
let's let's have an honest moment. I need to go back and beat that game. I was really into it.

10:36.420 --> 10:41.300
And then the moving happened. You might remember that was right around the time of the year I moved

10:41.300 --> 10:48.260
and I completely derailed from all of that. Okay, so I need to go back and finish Arceus at some

10:48.260 --> 10:54.260
point. Um, I was hoping there would be some DLC or something that would motivate that but nope,

10:54.260 --> 10:58.980
we never did get that. So I'm almost more excited about a sequel to that game than anything else.

10:59.700 --> 11:04.420
Um, Mike Defton chat says we were just used to double dipping by by now with

11:04.420 --> 11:09.940
Nintendo. It's just an acceptable thing that we allow. Mike Defton chat says we

11:09.940 --> 11:14.100
already had our chance of Pokemon gun with fifth gen being based on the United States.

11:14.500 --> 11:18.580
Oh, flow blow, but he can make that joke. He's in Mexico. I know that so he can make fun of us for

11:18.580 --> 11:24.500
sure. And well, we never said it had to be Pokemon handgun. It could be Pokemon potato gun. You know,

11:24.500 --> 11:31.300
there's a lot of different types of guns. So it could be Pokemon blow gun. Water got water pistol

11:31.300 --> 11:37.300
emoji could be a lot of things. So Bobby Blackwolf chat says I'm sadly not interested in Scarlet

11:37.300 --> 11:40.900
Violet. I did get sword and finished it. That's interesting to me, Bobby, because

11:41.540 --> 11:48.500
I the amount that I loved sword and shield will shield specifically, and finish that

11:48.500 --> 11:55.380
is like part of my big motivator why I'm so in on Scarlet and violet. And I can tell you how this is

11:55.380 --> 11:59.860
different. So we all know my friend Shane, who frequently guests on this show and what a Pokemon

11:59.860 --> 12:06.660
maniac he is right. You all know this, right? Here's the thing. Usually, for most Pokemon games,

12:06.660 --> 12:10.340
Shane is having to say, Are you gonna get it? Are you gonna get it to be so cool? You got to get it

12:10.340 --> 12:13.380
which version are you gonna get? Well, you should get this one because I'm getting this one. We can

12:13.380 --> 12:17.140
trade to do that. Like usually he's having to do all that with the releases. I'm like, Alright,

12:17.140 --> 12:22.020
fine. Yes. Yes. I'll get the Pokemon game. Yes. This time, he kind of started that same thing.

12:22.020 --> 12:25.860
Like, hey, are you gonna get Pokemon Gen nine? I'm like, Yeah, I'm definitely getting it. I

12:25.860 --> 12:28.900
definitely want to get Pokemon Scarlet. And I definitely want to play the game to completion.

12:28.900 --> 12:35.380
And he's just kind of like, Oh, great. Yeah, cool. It's kind of like, wait, wait, you mean,

12:35.380 --> 12:40.420
I don't need to convince you this time? It's like, no, I actually enjoyed the last gen of

12:40.420 --> 12:46.260
Pokemon that all of the longtime fans seem to hate. I enjoyed it so much that I don't need

12:46.260 --> 12:51.300
convincing to get the next gen. I want it because it's it's apparently more of the same formula.

12:51.300 --> 12:58.340
So that's that. Bobby Blackwolf says I've already played a Pokemon on Switch. So not really looking

12:58.340 --> 13:05.220
for more of the same. Oh, but have you played Pokemon on Switch? Oh, led. Well, so I just need

13:05.620 --> 13:12.740
what I need to do is I clearly not need to just send Shane Bobby Blackwolf phone number. That's

13:12.740 --> 13:21.860
what I need to do. All right. Anyway, all right. We got derailed from the kickoff topic gaming

13:21.860 --> 13:26.340
lobbyists. Like I said, tonight's the night to get derailed. So let's get into the real kickoff

13:26.340 --> 13:31.140
topic tonight. Loki, you want to take this on? It's about prices, right? The price is right. The

13:31.140 --> 13:37.140
price is wrong. It's it's about just kind of the inevitability at some point. And it's not even

13:37.140 --> 13:44.740
necessarily a confirmation of prices going up. But basically, you know, with Sony raising the price

13:44.740 --> 13:52.340
of I don't know if they necessarily they had to raise the price of their games. But they did,

13:52.340 --> 14:00.660
because they they say it warranted $70, whatever. And of course, with like, say, the meta quest,

14:00.740 --> 14:06.660
you know, to going up in price and stuff like that, stuff obviously is getting more expensive.

14:06.660 --> 14:16.420
And according to Microsoft, you know, they spoke to was it Phil Spencer, who had said, you know,

14:16.420 --> 14:21.860
we've held price on our console, we've held price on games and our subscriptions. I don't think

14:21.860 --> 14:26.100
we'll be able to do that forever. I do think at some point, we'll have to raise some prices on

14:26.100 --> 14:34.260
certain things, obviously, probably the subscriptions. But, I mean, it's not going to

14:34.260 --> 14:39.060
happen this holiday, he says, obviously, I mean, obviously, and we're already in the holiday.

14:40.020 --> 14:45.220
Makes perfect sense. So maybe next year, the prices will go up slightly. I mean, honestly,

14:45.220 --> 14:50.260
if you think about it, though, like, when's the last time that they raised the cost of Game Pass

14:50.260 --> 14:55.460
or Xbox Live or something like that? It's been a few years. And when you have like streaming

14:55.460 --> 14:59.380
services, like, you know, Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, and stuff like that, I think raising the

14:59.380 --> 15:06.260
prices, you know, at least once a year, I'm not surprised that this is going up. And it may even

15:06.260 --> 15:13.300
be like a marginal thing. Will they raise the price of their games? Maybe if the market demand,

15:13.300 --> 15:17.700
like if they're able to do that, like, I don't think a lot of game companies are doing it.

15:17.700 --> 15:25.060
It's basically Activision. I don't know if EA is selling their games for $70. I hope not,

15:25.060 --> 15:31.780
because it's not worth it. And Sony. I mean, those are the three that I can think of that are

15:31.780 --> 15:40.500
selling their games for $70. And sometimes I think that's warranted. Like, I was some of the,

15:40.500 --> 15:45.620
you know, first party Sony games, I could see how they could get away with that. Call of Duty

15:45.620 --> 15:51.460
Modern Warfare 2, probably not. They're probably not worth $70. I don't see the value there.

15:51.940 --> 15:58.660
But I guess we'll have to see. Definitely not Madden, but Madden was sold, I think,

15:58.660 --> 16:05.220
for $70. That's certainly not worth it. So it's just a matter of what the consumers will pay for.

16:05.220 --> 16:07.940
I mean, and I get it that they're saying that things are getting more expensive,

16:07.940 --> 16:13.860
but I don't buy that. Like, I get it that you can charge more upfront for it, but you're also,

16:13.860 --> 16:18.820
you know, charging on the back end with all these game passes and season passes and DLC and all

16:18.820 --> 16:23.620
this stuff that's shoved in there. And a lot of times game mechanics built around just all

16:23.620 --> 16:27.780
of this stuff in the first place. So even though, like, people like to make the stupid argument and

16:27.780 --> 16:34.180
the wrong argument that, oh, games have never been cheaper. That's not true, because when I

16:34.180 --> 16:41.780
was buying a game back in 2005 for the Xbox 360, they didn't really have a ton of DLC or anything

16:41.780 --> 16:47.060
like that available at the time. And certainly no game passes. So when you're getting a $60 game,

16:47.380 --> 16:52.180
it was pretty much complete. You would have some bug fixes every now and then, but it certainly

16:52.180 --> 16:56.580
wouldn't be this game comes out. Oh, hey, it's half finished. Let's have a roadmap of how we're

16:56.580 --> 17:01.460
going to complete our game. It's like, well, you know, perhaps you should have finished it before

17:01.460 --> 17:07.940
you sold it. I mean, that's how it used to be. So yes, things will probably get more expensive. But

17:07.940 --> 17:12.660
at the same time, you know what, though, like one thing we are hearing from just the general public

17:13.620 --> 17:19.060
is, yeah, everything's getting more expensive, but you know what's not going up my salary.

17:19.060 --> 17:24.260
And so you can charge more for those games, but less people are going to buy it. And eventually,

17:24.260 --> 17:29.460
what you're going to get is you're going to get it's going to move towards piracy is going to be

17:29.460 --> 17:33.380
what's going to happen with all these different streaming services splitting off with their own

17:33.380 --> 17:38.420
content. All these game companies, you know, charging more for their games when their games

17:38.420 --> 17:44.580
come out and they're unfinished and just buggy as hell or just a mess. Yeah, people are going

17:44.580 --> 17:51.300
to lose trust in you and they're just going to move to piracy. But I mean, do whatever you think

17:51.300 --> 17:55.060
is good for your company. It just doesn't necessarily mean everybody's going to follow suit

17:55.060 --> 17:59.140
with that. Well, and with multiplayer games being as popular as they are, that's going to be a very

17:59.140 --> 18:02.420
hard thing to pirate. I mean, they always have been because the minute those things talk to the

18:02.420 --> 18:07.140
servers, they're going to be able to suss out if it's a pirate version or not. So you know, which

18:07.140 --> 18:10.660
is also why a lot of single player games were having multiplayer elements for some time and

18:10.660 --> 18:15.220
still continue to. So by the way, I just want to point out Bobby Blackwell researched your EA

18:15.220 --> 18:22.740
question and points out that FIFA 23 is $70 on Steam. I can guarantee that's not worth it. Not

18:22.740 --> 18:29.460
worth it on Steam on Steam. Come on. Like, console, you might be able to get away with that on PC.

18:29.460 --> 18:35.460
Are you serious? Like, I don't. Please don't buy the game for $70. It is not worth $70.

18:36.260 --> 18:43.140
I guarantee you it's mostly recycled from last year. I, again, I'm sympathetic to the game.

18:43.140 --> 18:47.940
I mean, like, I'm not saying I love the idea of the games going up to $70. But like, I understand

18:47.940 --> 18:52.100
it, especially as we're sitting here going, you know, we just had a big debate on the show a

18:52.100 --> 18:57.220
couple weeks ago and across the entire internet about our voice actors being paid enough, right?

18:57.220 --> 19:00.820
We just went through that whole thing. And I realized that voice actors, you know, need to

19:00.820 --> 19:04.100
make more money. And that money's got to come from somewhere. And I realized the people working and

19:04.100 --> 19:07.940
making the games should have a good quality life. And that money's got to come from somewhere.

19:07.940 --> 19:14.020
However, and I want to make this clear, I think the executive salaries are where a good chunk of

19:14.020 --> 19:18.420
that ought to come from. I know it won't because that's just the way society works.

19:18.420 --> 19:23.380
And I would totally make that argument for like, a lot of other games, maybe Sony might be a good

19:23.380 --> 19:28.660
argument for that $70. And you know, whereas a lot of other games are really well polished when they

19:28.660 --> 19:33.460
come out. And God of War Ragnarok is excellent game is going to be it's going to be hard to

19:33.460 --> 19:39.060
argue that God of War Ragnarok is not worth $70. Like apparently, it's 50 solid hours of gameplay.

19:39.060 --> 19:45.780
It's not a game that's going to be loaded up with, you know, cosmetic packs and all this BS. Like

19:45.780 --> 19:50.020
God of War Ragnarok, I think is a good example of a game that can get away with charging $70. And

19:50.020 --> 19:55.380
it's hard to complain about it. Yeah. Whereas EA is recycling the game that they had from last year,

19:55.380 --> 20:00.580
adding minimal features to it and making billions of dollars off of micro transactions from their

20:00.580 --> 20:05.220
FIFA Ultimate Team series. So don't give me Oh, they're there. I'm sure that all those people

20:05.220 --> 20:10.100
that work for EA are probably starving and stuff like that, because they're not being paid enough.

20:10.100 --> 20:14.020
But it's not because they don't have the money to do it. They have so much money that they don't

20:14.020 --> 20:18.340
even know what to do with yet it can't. No amount of money they seem to throw at their game can't

20:18.340 --> 20:23.060
make it good. So I don't know what the problem is there. They just probably don't care. Because

20:23.060 --> 20:28.740
even if they just turn out the same crap as last year, they'll still make billions of dollars. So

20:28.820 --> 20:33.860
the the the community has spoken, we will buy whatever crap you put out,

20:33.860 --> 20:37.860
no matter for how much you charge for it. And we'll pay even more money on the back end,

20:37.860 --> 20:44.020
because we got to have our FIFA Ultimate Team. We're, you know, I, we keep having this discussion

20:44.020 --> 20:49.940
about the $70 game, the $70 game. And I think the reality is, there are so many ways to price a game

20:49.940 --> 20:55.860
now in 2022. That like, I think the $70 game is sort of like, it's just this weird, like,

20:55.860 --> 21:01.140
it's an option. But it's not like where all of the games are going. For example, Overwatch 2,

21:01.140 --> 21:07.620
25 million people are playing Overwatch 2, that is technically a free game. But we all know it's

21:07.620 --> 21:11.620
free with a giant asterisk if you want to get any of the cool stuff. Same thing with something like

21:11.620 --> 21:16.980
Fortnite, which is one of the biggest games in the galaxy right now. Free with an asterisk. Pokemon Go

21:16.980 --> 21:22.260
free with an asterisk. Like that's another way to price games. You can do monthly subscription.

21:22.260 --> 21:26.500
It doesn't work for a lot of games, but Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft, say hello.

21:26.500 --> 21:30.900
You can do, you know, the monthly subscription type of model. You can do a cheap, you can do a

21:30.900 --> 21:38.340
hybrid. You can do a cheap as fuck base game that is then loaded with, you know, um, maybe not like

21:38.340 --> 21:44.020
a ton, like, like just a lot of add-ons. Dead by Daylight is a great example of that. $20 game,

21:44.020 --> 21:49.380
loaded with add-ons that are, that it's hard to say aren't, you know, that don't bring value.

21:49.380 --> 21:54.100
They do, but there's, you know, just a lot. Fifth Dream in chat says, why food games are

21:54.100 --> 21:58.100
technically free, but cost deliver in your soul to play as well. I believe you're talking about

21:58.100 --> 22:04.420
Genshin Impact, which is free with an asterisk. So again, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just pointing out

22:04.420 --> 22:10.740
$70 is like, we keep saying the, the industry says the industry is not all on a $70 game.

22:10.740 --> 22:15.860
The reality is there are all sorts of pricing now in the industry and you have to decide,

22:15.940 --> 22:18.180
is it worth it or is it not? How bad do you want to play the game?

22:18.180 --> 22:23.060
That's my point is they make the, the argument that they're making that they say they justify

22:23.060 --> 22:30.420
$70 is the quality of the game. So I better see the quality of that game when you're charging $70

22:30.420 --> 22:37.860
for it. And the problem is it, the quality doesn't, it's not an upgrade from a $60 game.

22:37.860 --> 22:43.780
The same with FIFA. Like when it was a $50 game and went to a $60 game,

22:44.420 --> 22:49.540
it didn't increase in quality. It's the same stuff they've been pulling for years,

22:49.540 --> 22:55.780
and it's just ridiculous. Sony can charge $70 for a game and it's easier to digest because

22:56.660 --> 23:00.260
their quality is there. If you can see the quality in their work.

23:00.260 --> 23:06.340
Quite honestly, if Final Fantasy 16 were $99 and 99 cents, I would probably still be buying it.

23:06.340 --> 23:10.740
Well, I mean, that's fine, whatever you find value in, you know, with that. But I,

23:10.740 --> 23:18.260
I think it's ridiculous, but you know, to that point though, you know, we look at the cost of

23:18.260 --> 23:23.620
games, but that's not how necessarily we are digesting these games as well. So like, for

23:23.620 --> 23:29.620
example, there's X-Box game pass. So, you know, that they're seeing right now is accounting for

23:29.620 --> 23:37.860
15% of Microsoft's gaming revenue as of right now. I'm kind of surprised it's that low to be honest,

23:38.340 --> 23:44.420
but then I think about the globe. I think about the globe and I wonder, is that 15% globally or

23:44.420 --> 23:49.060
15% in the US? Because I bet it would be higher if you were to look at the US only, but if it's

23:49.060 --> 23:53.780
globally, I sort of understand why there's a lot of countries around the world that probably are

23:53.780 --> 24:00.180
still on physical media and not ready to have the network infrastructure to download a ton, a ton of

24:00.180 --> 24:05.140
games through something like game pass. So that's kind of where the 15% makes more sense to me is on

24:05.140 --> 24:13.860
a global level. And they're saying that it's not necessarily expected to increase either. They're

24:14.660 --> 24:20.020
saying, I don't think it's going to get bigger than that. I think the overall revenue grows. So

24:20.020 --> 24:25.700
15% of a bigger number, but we don't have this future where I think 50 to 70% of our revenue

24:25.700 --> 24:30.500
comes from subscriptions. That's interesting. Well, maybe in a future where games are 70 and

24:30.500 --> 24:37.780
$80, that might be a better deal because we don't have rental services anymore.

24:37.780 --> 24:42.980
I haven't paid full price for a Microsoft game in five years because I've been on game pass

24:42.980 --> 24:48.420
and I don't have to. But since we've been talking about price increase, price increase,

24:48.420 --> 24:52.340
we talk about subscription prices going up and game pass is highly likely to go up.

24:52.980 --> 24:57.620
Just a word of advice. Again, everybody's financial situation is different. So not everybody

24:57.620 --> 25:02.180
may be in a position where they can do this, but I would just kind of plant the seed of,

25:02.180 --> 25:07.380
if you can do this, I would highly advise you with Black Friday on the horizon.

25:07.380 --> 25:11.380
We know we're going to see some deep discounts. We almost always around this time of year around

25:11.380 --> 25:18.020
the holiday, see some type of discount on PlayStation network, as well as Xbox game pass.

25:18.020 --> 25:23.700
If you can, I would load up on a year or even two, whatever you can afford and kind of like

25:23.700 --> 25:27.380
lock in your rate because it's inevitable that those are going to go up and you'll probably

25:27.380 --> 25:31.380
be able to get a lower rate because of Black Friday sales. There might be limitations and

25:31.380 --> 25:36.100
weird things like that, but I would, and again, I'm talking about you dropping a couple hundred

25:36.100 --> 25:41.300
dollars at once, which is certainly not feasible for everyone. If your situation calls for it

25:41.300 --> 25:45.300
though, and you sort of know like I'm in it for the long haul with game pass, that's me.

25:45.300 --> 25:49.220
I'm in it for the long haul with game pass. I know I will be on game pass for a very long time.

25:49.220 --> 25:54.660
So I'm going to be looking around to probably load up on two or three years of game pass.

25:55.220 --> 26:01.380
And I know a lot of you out there loaded up a lot of game pass. Bobby Black Wolf confirms

26:01.380 --> 26:07.780
you can only front load up to three years of game pass, but you still can. And I think the

26:07.780 --> 26:14.740
clock is running out for many of you that got that three years right out the gate. I think what 2023,

26:14.740 --> 26:20.340
maybe 2024 for some of you, but I think 2023 is about where that clock is going to end for

26:20.420 --> 26:25.700
many of you. Um, so you might want to load up on another three years. It just, it just, I mean,

26:25.700 --> 26:31.300
again, it depends on your situation. Um, but I would just think about that as an option.

26:31.300 --> 26:35.540
If you are a heavy game pass user or PlayStation network, to be quite honest,

26:35.540 --> 26:39.140
I'm sure those prices will go up as well eventually. Maybe not as fast, but eventually

26:41.940 --> 26:46.580
just something to think about. All right. Uh, let's take a moment to talk a little bit about

26:46.660 --> 26:50.500
our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week on

26:50.500 --> 26:55.860
X-Box or otherwise. So, uh, dark soccer is not joining us tonight. Uh, but I will start with

26:55.860 --> 27:02.980
Loki then play Minecraft. It's I know shocking, shocking. Um, we live stream last night too.

27:02.980 --> 27:07.780
I forgot to post up about that. I was in, um, I was just saying, I didn't see that.

27:08.740 --> 27:13.220
It wasn't me streaming, but it was, it was a server made this streaming.

27:13.300 --> 27:21.060
I was participating with that. Um, but yeah, I did a, a rather, it's a semi-large build

27:21.060 --> 27:27.380
that will be in a next episode here. Hopefully very soon. Um, I was trying to get back down

27:27.380 --> 27:31.060
the weekly. It's been two weeks already, but we're not going to make it four weeks. So

27:32.020 --> 27:36.100
we'll get there. It's just, I have the, some editing stuff I got to do.

27:36.100 --> 27:39.540
We said it's another big build like your, um, Mega Man.

27:39.540 --> 27:43.220
Not that big. No, not as big as the octopus. That that that's ridiculous. No,

27:43.940 --> 27:48.820
regular, regular large bills. Okay. Ridiculous. Like 200,000 partially ridiculous.

27:49.460 --> 27:53.700
No, it looks nice. It's really cool. It's the centerpiece of one of the,

27:54.340 --> 28:00.660
the robot masters areas. So it's, um, pretty cool looking. And it actually is from

28:01.220 --> 28:07.780
Mega Man as well. It's from a game I haven't played. Um, it's a Mega Man zero two, but

28:08.340 --> 28:13.540
it's a, it's a giant tree. All right. But yeah, that's, that's pretty much it.

28:14.580 --> 28:19.140
Uh, let's see my gaming week. Um, yeah, I was a little busy with like show hosting this weekend

28:19.140 --> 28:23.140
and stuff. So, um, I haven't had as much time for games. So I have been playing dead by daylight.

28:23.140 --> 28:27.540
I streamed a little bit about that the other night, um, because they are doing a big, uh,

28:27.540 --> 28:31.460
blood point push in the game right now. So just, you know, uh, I've been working on

28:31.460 --> 28:37.700
prestiging more survivors. So I prestiged both Kate and somebody else this last week. Was it

28:37.700 --> 28:42.020
Nia? No, I think it was somebody else, but yeah, I prestiged two more survivors this last week.

28:42.020 --> 28:46.580
Uh, Oh, Elodie, I think was one of them that I prestiged. So, um, I'm, I'm just working on trying

28:46.580 --> 28:51.060
to prestige all the survivors. Uh, maybe I'll play killer at some point, but the game has been in

28:51.060 --> 28:54.500
this weird place where the survivors have been getting all the bonuses now in the shorter queue

28:54.500 --> 28:59.780
times. Whereas six months ago, it was, uh, very different. So, uh, I've been working on that,

28:59.780 --> 29:05.060
uh, still playing Final Fantasy 14. I still am obsessed with the farming sim mode in that game,

29:05.060 --> 29:09.780
the island sanctuary. I now have earned every single cosmetic that you can get right now in

29:09.780 --> 29:15.540
the island sanctuary. And so what I'm doing, I am just stockpiling the currency to just instantly

29:15.540 --> 29:19.860
buy whatever's next. When they put out the new content, I'm hoping they don't outsmart me and

29:19.860 --> 29:23.940
make it a different currency. I'm really frightened. They're going to do that so that I save up like

29:23.940 --> 29:28.820
200,000 of the island calories and then I can't even use them or I can always buy materia or

29:28.820 --> 29:33.300
something with them, but we'll see. So that's going on. Um, SSG100 Matt in chat says gaming

29:33.300 --> 29:37.620
week Overwatch 2 with a new Junkenstein event going on. I actually did check that out as well.

29:37.620 --> 29:43.460
I, I haven't played a lot of Overwatch 2, but I did the new Junkenstein event just once just to,

29:43.460 --> 29:47.620
you know, say that I did it and pick up the easy cosmetics and whatever battle pass points,

29:47.620 --> 29:52.020
whatever you, I'm thinking my battle pass like level 11. I've barely played any Overwatch, but

29:52.340 --> 29:57.300
I've done, I've done a little bit. Yeah. I also noticed, uh, that the skill like it,

29:57.300 --> 30:02.100
this one is harder than the last one was, uh, the, the original event that's, you know,

30:02.100 --> 30:05.060
several years old at this point, you can still play the original if you want to,

30:05.060 --> 30:08.580
that's still in the game. But yeah, the new one was harder because you had to, you know,

30:08.580 --> 30:13.940
go exploring and it's not always obvious where you need to go is, is a little more challenging. So,

30:13.940 --> 30:19.940
um, I've also been playing that. Um, but otherwise I didn't really dabble in anything new this week,

30:19.940 --> 30:26.020
to be honest. Um, just kind of the old reliables, uh, until, uh, probably, probably it'll stay that

30:26.020 --> 30:30.340
way until maybe Pokemon Scarlet and violet. I do kind of want to pick up bandana three. I just,

30:30.340 --> 30:35.700
I don't know if I have the time, but my, my hosting and weekend stuff clears up significantly next

30:35.700 --> 30:41.860
month. So, um, I'll have a little more time for games at that point. Um, I, we're not going to be

30:41.860 --> 30:45.780
here on OLR. At least I won't be, I, I don't know if Loki at our cyber want to do something, but I

30:45.780 --> 30:50.180
won't be here in two weeks, uh, veterans day weekend because I'll be out on vacation and kind

30:50.180 --> 30:57.300
of like after that point, I get freed up a lot. So, um, I'll have more time to sink into catching

30:57.300 --> 31:05.460
up on backlog games and the games that come out, uh, this, this, uh, over the next, uh, few weeks.

31:05.460 --> 31:09.700
And so the holiday releases, uh, quest buster and chat says, I'm having a lot of fun with bandana

31:09.700 --> 31:14.260
three. Uh, me, she says, I'm hoping to get two copies of bandana three for shits and giggles,

31:14.260 --> 31:20.420
digital and physical, uh, Jaskren and chat says gaming week, mass effect. One first time play

31:20.420 --> 31:25.060
through all on the steam deck. Uh, yeah, that's cool. I'm assuming that's like the legendary

31:25.060 --> 31:29.380
edition. Maybe that's neat. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says I'm considering getting bandana three

31:29.380 --> 31:34.180
because I was told you don't really have to have played two to understand it. I played one when it

31:34.180 --> 31:38.260
originally came out, but it's been a while. I am also under that understanding that number three,

31:38.260 --> 31:43.700
you don't need to know the first two games that well to understand. So you don't, you don't need

31:43.700 --> 31:49.060
a deep understanding of those. So that's pretty cool. So we'll see. Oh yeah. No man's sky. I have

31:49.060 --> 31:52.740
been dabbling in that game a little bit as well. I see you all know that I play that game way too

31:52.740 --> 31:59.620
much, but it's, I love the new relaxed modes. I really do. So good times. All right. Let's get

31:59.620 --> 32:05.220
into some more gaming news and what's going on throughout the industry. What little there is a

32:05.220 --> 32:11.140
lot of updates on other stories, but, uh, Loki, what do you have for us? It's hard to keep track

32:11.140 --> 32:16.580
of all these different lawsuits, but this is going hearkening back to the first lawsuit for

32:16.580 --> 32:23.300
Activision Blizzard regarding the poor treatment of their employees. Um, so this is from the

32:23.300 --> 32:28.820
California civil rights department, which was previously known as the California department

32:28.820 --> 32:35.860
of fair employment and housing. Um, so they're basically, uh, Activision is trying to get the

32:35.860 --> 32:43.140
case thrown out again, basically saying that because of these, the cases, because of this

32:43.140 --> 32:53.620
case, they have suffered, um, bad PR, I guess it is, it is, um, is tarnished their reputation,

32:54.740 --> 33:03.620
uh, of a company that's about to get acquired. I'm sorry that your reputation is tarnished because

33:03.620 --> 33:09.380
people found out that you harassed your employees. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, but that's what they're trying

33:09.380 --> 33:16.660
to make the argument. I don't think, Oh, obviously it's, it's not succeeding, but yep. So Activision

33:16.660 --> 33:25.060
was like the truth hurts. And for that reason, we shouldn't be sued. Uh, but yeah, so the case

33:25.060 --> 33:32.020
is still moving ahead. It is supposed to take place, um, into 2023, I think at some point.

33:32.980 --> 33:38.500
All right. That's going to be interesting to see how that's timed with the merger. If the merger

33:38.500 --> 33:42.020
is allowed to go through, a lot of people think that Europe is going to shut down that merger and

33:42.020 --> 33:46.660
it may not actually happen. That could be very interesting. So be interesting. I would, I would

33:46.660 --> 33:50.980
be curious if Microsoft might try to buy a part of Activision Blizzard, if that gets stopped,

33:50.980 --> 33:56.420
like Microsoft's like, we'll just take Blizzard. Thanks. Right. It's kind of weird though. Like I

33:56.420 --> 34:01.860
especially find it funny when we hear about Sony making the argument that, Oh, they'll have an

34:02.180 --> 34:09.060
unfair advantage with exclusives. It's like, dude, you do the same thing. Shut the hell up.

34:09.060 --> 34:13.940
Like, can you, this is literally your game plan. Well, they're doing it too. Now it's not fair.

34:15.220 --> 34:22.420
We want to do it first. I don't know. Corporations got to hate him.

34:24.820 --> 34:30.100
All right. Uh, well earlier in the show I had brought up Genshin impact. Um, this is,

34:30.100 --> 34:33.060
I tried Genshin impact. I gotta be honest. I couldn't get into it,

34:33.060 --> 34:38.740
but I know a lot of people love this game. They love Genshin impact and they play the

34:38.740 --> 34:43.460
shit out of this game. Uh, unfortunately Genshin impact has had a bit of a data breach,

34:43.460 --> 34:50.340
uh, that has happened. Um, and so, uh, people's, uh, information could be at risk. So I hope you

34:50.340 --> 34:56.500
all are changing your passwords. That's for sure. Uh, let's see. I want to mention, uh,

34:56.500 --> 35:02.740
what is happening here. Unfortunately, the first thing I tried to go to the site wouldn't work.

35:02.740 --> 35:08.420
So I'm trying to quickly get into an alternate site that talks about what's happening here.

35:09.140 --> 35:18.980
Um, all right. Sorry. All earlier this week, uh, Genshin impact, uh, HoYo verse had a data breach

35:18.980 --> 35:23.380
and big batches of information were shared online to talk about the details of new characters,

35:23.380 --> 35:30.580
quests, and events from 3.3 until 3.8. Uh, there were DMCA strike to poach that came out of the

35:30.580 --> 35:35.940
data breach. Uh, so, uh, you know, you never know what's going to change there. Uh, although, uh,

35:35.940 --> 35:40.660
one of the leakers on Twitter had a change of heart saying after further consideration with

35:40.660 --> 35:45.460
friends, I decided to remove all my tweets from today just to be safe to make it clear.

35:45.460 --> 35:49.620
I do not condone what other methods in which the data was obtained and I was not involved in

35:49.620 --> 35:56.180
obtaining nor distributing the original data. Um, uh, apparently, uh, 36 weeks of content,

35:56.180 --> 36:01.300
uh, that is coming out for the game. We're all impacted by the breach and this information.

36:01.300 --> 36:06.100
Um, so to correct something I said a moment ago, I apologize, but no, uh, usernames and passwords

36:06.100 --> 36:11.860
have been put at risk yet, but I would say the logic says if they got in there and looked at

36:11.860 --> 36:16.900
some of this stuff, they probably got access to other stuff too. That's just not being acknowledged

36:16.900 --> 36:21.940
yet. So I would say, you know what, change your passwords anyway. I had a good habit.

36:21.940 --> 36:28.260
It's a good thing to do. And then quest buster says that, uh, it was, uh, some QA and employee

36:28.260 --> 36:34.100
info that was included in that as well. What was taken out from that. So, um, Bobby Blackwolf does

36:34.100 --> 36:38.740
say I never gave a username and password to them. It was attached to my PSN account. So hopefully

36:38.740 --> 36:42.980
for most people that did a type of link thing, it would be okay, but I'm sure there are people that

36:43.060 --> 36:48.900
have an account directly through the company as well. Um, possibly playing on PC or something. So

36:48.900 --> 36:53.220
it would be good to stay on top of that information. Uh, it is interesting though

36:53.220 --> 36:58.740
that most like web browsers and stuff will now tell you if a password was in a data leak. Have

36:58.740 --> 37:02.820
you, have you seen this? And like, I don't, I think Chrome does it. And I think, uh, some of

37:02.820 --> 37:06.740
the others do too, maybe edge, but like when you try to use a password on a website, if it's

37:06.740 --> 37:11.620
something that was in a data breach, it actually pops up and says this password was found in a data

37:11.620 --> 37:16.180
breach. You shouldn't use it. So it's interesting that it compares all that right out the gate.

37:16.180 --> 37:20.020
Try it, try it next time you sign up for a website, just put your password in as password,

37:20.020 --> 37:24.660
don't save it, but just put, put in something silly, uh, and, and see how the alert comes up.

37:24.660 --> 37:29.380
Bobby Blackwolf says Firefox does it too. I think that's very interesting how, um, they will help

37:29.380 --> 37:35.940
people, uh, not pick, uh, bad passwords in that regard. So remember use, use mixed words,

37:36.660 --> 37:42.820
mixed case, mixed letters, jumbles, punctuation numbers, uh, all that goes a long way. Don't use

37:42.820 --> 37:47.460
the name of pets, or if you are going to use the name of the pet, combine it with other things that

37:47.460 --> 37:55.860
don't make sense. Do your favorite pet, favorite food, you know, favorite cousin with, uh, some

37:55.860 --> 38:00.580
random capitalization and some numbers of significance to you. Uh, or Jaskren in chat

38:00.580 --> 38:05.060
says use a password manager. Absolutely. Uh, then you only have to remember one password,

38:05.060 --> 38:10.100
which is still sometimes a challenge for me. That's for sure. The password managers, man,

38:10.100 --> 38:14.820
they're, they're sure helping us. Every website now is like, you have to have a minimum of eight

38:14.820 --> 38:18.500
characters to this website. For this website, you have to have a minimum of eight, but no more than

38:18.500 --> 38:23.620
20, but you have to have at least one that's a punctuation and you can use numbers, but you can't

38:23.620 --> 38:29.460
use the number three. It's like every website has their own wild rules to them. So, uh, yeah,

38:29.460 --> 38:34.660
password managers are great. That's for sure. All right, moving on. Uh, this is very interesting

38:34.660 --> 38:41.140
about where the industry is headed, right? Um, yeah, well, it it's, I don't know if it's

38:41.140 --> 38:47.540
unexpected because we've seen this before with different games having partial or parts of their

38:47.540 --> 38:52.260
game that, well, it's kind of actually the opposite. So you may remember a while back,

38:52.260 --> 38:58.180
we had the whole issue where DLC was on the disc and people were upset about that. Well, what if

38:58.180 --> 39:04.260
the DLC isn't on the disc and the game isn't on the disc as well? The disc is just, I guess the

39:04.420 --> 39:13.540
memento, a memento with a key to go download the game. Um, but yes. Yes. Um, so modern warfare two,

39:14.260 --> 39:21.220
uh, the Blu-ray disc that they have contained 72 megs of data. That's like enough to fit on AC

39:21.220 --> 39:28.740
ROM. Um, not even on a Blu-ray. I don't know why they pressed it onto a Blu-ray disc, but they did.

39:28.740 --> 39:34.020
And it allows it's basically forcing players to connect to the internet and download a hundred

39:34.020 --> 39:39.700
plus gigabytes of data. So that's great. So like, even though you didn't want to buy the

39:39.700 --> 39:45.540
game digitally because, Hey, I have bandwidth caps and I can't really do that. Activision says,

39:45.540 --> 39:51.140
you know what? We don't care what you like. You paid $70 for a game. So you get to pay

39:51.140 --> 39:57.380
those overdraft fees or whatever for going over your bandwidth caps. It's it's the Activision gift

39:57.380 --> 40:03.700
that keeps on giving. And so you're going to have to download all of that data for the game. Um,

40:04.580 --> 40:11.940
I guess to protect from spoilers or something. Well, I mean the God award team like literally

40:11.940 --> 40:16.340
tweeted earlier. So what are the reps literally tweeted earlier today? I kind of wish we'd gone

40:16.340 --> 40:22.020
this route because now a retailer leaked their game two weeks early and all of the spoilers

40:22.020 --> 40:27.460
are out there now. That's a problem though. And I could definitely speak to this. Uh,

40:27.460 --> 40:31.940
that's a problem because you ship your stuff too early to mass market retailers

40:31.940 --> 40:36.020
is the problem. And, and the, all the time people always are going to get accused like

40:36.020 --> 40:42.740
the small mom and pop shops of breaking street dates to, um, get a competitive advantage over

40:42.740 --> 40:48.980
their competitors. And they do. But the thing is though, is those mom and pop stores aren't buying

40:48.980 --> 40:55.060
direct from Activision. They are buying from a distributor who doesn't even get the copies of

40:55.060 --> 41:01.220
the game until like the week of, and barely gets them to them by street date. So it's leaking two

41:01.220 --> 41:08.180
weeks early. It's because the dumb assholes at Activision decided to ship the game that early.

41:08.180 --> 41:14.100
So you have yourself to blame, or in this case it would be Sony. You have yourself to blame

41:14.660 --> 41:20.100
for shipping it that early. That's your own damn fault. Sorry, but it is if you didn't send out

41:20.100 --> 41:29.460
the door, can't get leaked. Um, but in this case, so this is absolutely stupid. Once again, $70 game

41:29.460 --> 41:34.980
and you're making me download the whole game. Why, why even make a physical version of it?

41:34.980 --> 41:38.500
What is the point? This sucks for game preservation as well, because

41:39.140 --> 41:45.060
when Activision inevitably takes down the server, how am I going to get my game? You know, like it

41:45.060 --> 41:50.500
in the future, it's just awful. Um, Bobby, Bobby lack of in chat does have a good point about the,

41:50.500 --> 41:54.340
because you had said, you know, why even bother with a Blu-ray when it's the size can fit on a

41:54.340 --> 41:59.220
CD. Uh, they press it that way because Xbox and PS five can't play games off a DVD or CD,

41:59.220 --> 42:02.420
which makes sense. I mean, they might be able to read them to play the music or the movie,

42:02.420 --> 42:07.140
but they're not trained to boot games off of them. I get that. I mean, basically,

42:07.700 --> 42:14.020
but why, like, I would just put card in the box at this point. Like what's the point? Like, I mean,

42:14.020 --> 42:20.900
seriously that like, what's the point anyways, for this, I guess. So I don't even know.

42:20.900 --> 42:29.700
It's just dumb. Yeah. I, I, I, you know, with a game like call of duty specifically,

42:30.340 --> 42:34.980
I know that a big chunk of that is multiplayer and you're going to have to be online for

42:34.980 --> 42:42.660
multiplayer anyway. So I'm kind of like, I'm not, I'm not like surprised that like, you have to be

42:42.660 --> 42:46.020
online to download all the patches and all the things like that. And that, you know, you're not

42:46.020 --> 42:50.820
going to get a lot of play off the disc. Although I know, yes, there is a single player campaign to

42:50.820 --> 42:56.180
as well. I know, but I know a lot of people play a multiplayer, but I also, you know, I'm also

42:56.180 --> 43:00.580
spoiled now with lack of bandwidth caps. And that's something that was strongly something

43:00.580 --> 43:05.220
that affected me, you know, six months ago. And this would tick me off because a big reason why

43:05.220 --> 43:10.900
I would buy things physically was because I don't want to download like 80 gigabytes. And that's

43:10.900 --> 43:16.500
what pissed me off about legendary edition. Or just like even, even just think about your

43:16.500 --> 43:20.020
customer. I mean, obviously they're not thinking about the customer. They could, they see them as a

43:20.020 --> 43:24.340
wallet, so it doesn't matter. They don't think of them as people, but like, aside from that,

43:24.980 --> 43:30.820
so not only am I going to now have to like, say I bought this day one or whatever, midnight launch

43:30.820 --> 43:36.740
or whatever, even if they do that anymore, I'm going to go home and I can't play the game because

43:36.740 --> 43:45.220
I have to download 100 gigabytes for this. And, and the latest patch that they have, it's reported,

43:45.220 --> 43:51.460
it's over 150 gigabytes large when you include the campaign and multiplayer. So not only am I

43:51.460 --> 43:55.380
going to download the game, but then if it patches again, I'm gonna have to download another hundred,

43:55.380 --> 44:00.660
some gigs. Do they not know the reality that we live in? People have bandwidth caps. It's,

44:00.660 --> 44:07.460
we don't live in a gigabit world where everybody has lightning fast, you know, fiber internet and

44:07.460 --> 44:11.620
can just download whatever because they have unlimited data caps. If we lived in that world,

44:11.700 --> 44:16.740
this would be no problem whatsoever, but we don't live in that world. And it doesn't work. What

44:16.740 --> 44:22.980
about here's a weird idea. What about somebody that doesn't have a great internet connection?

44:22.980 --> 44:27.380
So they're downloading it two megabits per second, or they're downloading it at, you know,

44:28.100 --> 44:33.540
DSL speeds or something like that. Well, I hope you can, I guess I'll play it next weekend when

44:33.540 --> 44:38.020
it's done downloading. I mean, like a lot of military guys and gals like to play this game.

44:38.020 --> 44:42.340
And, uh, the internet connection is usually pretty shitty, uh, overseas. So.

44:43.220 --> 44:51.860
It is just such, it's so cell science. Like what, what costs can we cut so that we make more money?

44:51.860 --> 44:56.980
So the shareholders make more money is all that they, that's all they look at. They don't care

44:56.980 --> 45:03.220
about the quality of the game. It's just about how much money we can make. Um, Bobby was some

45:03.220 --> 45:08.180
more points in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And, you know, I do see this side

45:08.180 --> 45:13.380
of this, um, saying the disc is the key to unlock the game as well. It needs to be in the console.

45:13.380 --> 45:17.700
You can still resell the disc and you won't be able to play it without the disc. This means the

45:17.700 --> 45:22.180
resale market is still available for this game and the code, et cetera. It doesn't work that way. It

45:22.180 --> 45:28.500
does. And I will say to that, you know, comments credit, it does put aside one of my big problems

45:28.500 --> 45:32.980
with, you know, buying digital versus buying physical is that when you buy a game digital,

45:32.980 --> 45:37.540
you can't resell it. It has no equity. It doesn't have any type of collectible value,

45:37.540 --> 45:42.100
essentially, unless you're into digital collectibles, which, you know, um, I would

45:42.100 --> 45:47.140
say the mass market, when you look at things like NFTs is rejecting, um, you know, digital

45:47.140 --> 45:53.940
collectibles. So we've seen many stories about how, uh, the game industry specifically, they've

45:53.940 --> 45:59.620
been trying to make NFTs the next big thing and the, the, the gamers are rejecting it, which I

45:59.620 --> 46:04.260
appreciate and so forth. But my point is, is that, you know, because I like having those

46:04.260 --> 46:10.180
physical collectibles, at least as much as this method sucks, it does still play into the old

46:10.180 --> 46:16.260
system of the disc is the game and you can resell that and it has value, blah, blah, blah, blah,

46:16.260 --> 46:20.020
you know? So that part of it I get, but if I had a bandwidth cap, I'd be pissed.

46:20.660 --> 46:26.820
Yeah, but it's not $70 anymore because now you're caught, you're charging me the electricity to

46:26.820 --> 46:32.420
download the thing. You're charging me the bandwidth I have, so possibly exceeding it.

46:32.420 --> 46:39.220
You are costing me more time because I anticipated to be able to play this after,

46:39.220 --> 46:45.460
you know, obviously downloading an update patch, which is fine. You know, it's acceptable at this

46:45.460 --> 46:51.380
point. So it's, it's a lot more than $70 at this point. And then they're probably going to shove

46:51.380 --> 46:58.420
microtransactions and DLC and battle passes and all that other crap down your throat.

46:59.460 --> 47:05.860
So like, I don't feel bad when they say, Oh, we're charging $70 for our game and people don't want

47:05.860 --> 47:09.620
to buy it. I mean, people are still going to buy it because there are people that will just buy

47:10.420 --> 47:16.340
Call of Duty every year. It doesn't matter what they put out. But whatever. I mean, it's

47:18.340 --> 47:25.220
people, what I think it's upsetting about this is that people probably who are buying this don't

47:25.220 --> 47:29.060
know this until they've already bought it. It's not like something that they disclose like, Hey,

47:30.260 --> 47:35.940
you're gonna have to download. Well, it may be in tiny ass fucking print on the back of the box.

47:36.580 --> 47:40.820
requires internet, will you and that requires internet connection to download full game or

47:40.820 --> 47:43.300
something like that. It'll be in tiny ass fucking print on the back of the box.

47:45.060 --> 47:47.940
I think they should at least put like the campaign on there or something like that.

47:47.940 --> 47:51.700
They've done that in the past where the multiplayer is, you know,

47:51.700 --> 47:56.820
later on, because the servers will come online later or something like that you download it

47:56.820 --> 48:03.540
later. And I think that's somewhat acceptable, because then at least I'm not having to spend

48:03.540 --> 48:08.660
as much of my data as I would if I was to buy digitally. But once again, it's like,

48:10.580 --> 48:15.140
why buy it physically? And then I get it. Yeah, you can resell it later on. But do really people

48:15.140 --> 48:22.660
hassle with that. I don't know if a lot of people do anymore. Like, it's trading is not worth it.

48:22.660 --> 48:29.860
And to sell it online. Sure, you can do it. But is a hassle. So I don't know. I don't think I don't

48:29.860 --> 48:36.900
know if the use market is really what it used to be. But well, Activision sucks. What are you

48:36.900 --> 48:44.020
gonna do? Bobby says the PS five version has requires content download in small print on the

48:44.020 --> 48:50.660
bottom of the front of the box. So it's there, but it's, it's easily missable. Yeah, but most

48:50.660 --> 48:55.460
people don't mean that it's like, like content download, you may think, oh, that that means a

48:55.460 --> 48:59.860
part of the game. It doesn't mean the whole game. Like, I don't know. It's not. It's not

48:59.860 --> 49:05.380
specifically say, you will have to download this whole game. Like, and that's, I don't know,

49:05.380 --> 49:09.540
whatever. Who cares? I'm not the target demographic for this at the moment. So it's fine.

49:10.260 --> 49:15.620
All right. Well, let's move on and talk about orange right in chat says it should be as obvious

49:15.620 --> 49:20.100
as those switch games that don't even have the game card in it. Well, speaking of the switch,

49:20.900 --> 49:29.220
you can now use those controllers on various Apple devices. There was an update that will now use

49:29.220 --> 49:33.060
allow the Apple devices to use the classic controllers from the Nintendo switch.

49:33.060 --> 49:38.900
So you can use the N 64 classic controller, you can use that Sega Mega Drive Genesis classic

49:38.900 --> 49:42.900
controller, you can use the Super Nintendo classic controller, the NES classic controller,

49:42.900 --> 49:49.860
and you can use them with any device that runs either Mac OS 13, iOS 16, TV OS 16. So you know,

49:49.860 --> 49:56.340
pretty much, you know, any Apple device in the last couple years, the joy cons and switch pro

49:56.340 --> 50:01.940
controller that was already there. This is something for those, you know, special unique

50:01.940 --> 50:08.020
controllers, but also pretty cool. Like, you know, I know people have, you know, snuck in some

50:08.020 --> 50:14.100
emulation sometimes onto the Apple system. So those controllers can come in handy if you're

50:14.100 --> 50:19.780
managed to grab some of those things before they got pulled. Or, you know, even with retro inspired

50:20.420 --> 50:25.700
games, having these classic controllers can be a lot of fun, that's for sure. Also worth pointing

50:25.700 --> 50:29.620
out, you can also if you don't, if you don't want to use Nintendo controllers, you can still use

50:29.620 --> 50:34.420
Xbox series controllers, the dual sense, you can use a dual shock, you can go back and use an Xbox

50:34.420 --> 50:40.260
one controller. There are a lot of other devices that will work with the Apple devices. But

50:40.260 --> 50:48.820
interestingly enough, still no official Apple joystick. They tout a lot of compatibility with

50:48.820 --> 50:53.860
third party devices, but never an official one, which is just interesting. Unless I guess you

50:53.860 --> 50:59.060
count maybe the remote for the TV, but I don't really count that. Just it's always interesting

50:59.060 --> 51:04.980
to me how for whatever reason, they haven't really looked behind that rock. I'm just surprised

51:04.980 --> 51:09.940
because it would be very easy to make a shell that the phone could snap into and it would be a lot

51:09.940 --> 51:14.900
like a switch. But maybe because there's varying sizes of phones, I don't know. But I would think

51:14.900 --> 51:20.420
you could have a stretchy thing. But I guess it's whatever they don't want to do it. So

51:22.580 --> 51:28.660
but a lot of people own a Nintendo switch or one of those many other devices I just named that it

51:28.660 --> 51:34.020
also works with. So that is something you can do. Bobby Blackwell also points out anything's

51:34.020 --> 51:41.140
possible with 3d printers. It's true. It's true. All right. Let's move on. We have some more

51:41.140 --> 51:48.740
stories. Let's get to Loki. Yeah, so there's this game called the stores closed, which is an SCP

51:51.060 --> 51:56.660
infinite store survival game. So basically, it's this big procedurally generated

51:57.300 --> 52:06.660
furniture store. The problem is that the outside of the store has yellow lettering against a solid

52:06.660 --> 52:14.580
blue store. And so IKEA believes it looks like it looks too much like IKEA. And clearly, I mean,

52:15.940 --> 52:20.020
I think it's supposed to be slightly inspired by IKEA, but it's not supposed to be IKEA.

52:20.020 --> 52:25.300
It's more of like kind of the joke where you can wander through IKEA and kind of get lost a little

52:25.300 --> 52:29.940
bit, because they're really big and winding stores. True. So I think that's where they've

52:29.940 --> 52:35.060
kind of taken the inspiration from it. But the game itself looks pretty cool. You actually are

52:35.060 --> 52:40.260
like trapped inside the store and you have to avoid the staff who turn into giant monsters at

52:40.260 --> 52:48.820
night. And then you build of bases or forts out of the furniture. Which I love that. It's like

52:48.820 --> 52:55.220
it's got like, yeah, you forever end up having to live in a 310 square foot space, like the

52:55.860 --> 53:01.060
models in IKEA, you know, show you how here's how to live within 400 square feet or whatever,

53:01.060 --> 53:06.340
you know, you know, yeah, it's like that. But so yeah, they're basically there's a lawyer from

53:06.340 --> 53:14.260
IKEA had contacted them saying that they need to stop infringing on IKEA stores. They said that

53:14.980 --> 53:19.220
our client has learned that you're developing a video game the store is closed, which uses

53:19.220 --> 53:24.180
without our clients authorization indica associated with the famous IKEA stores.

53:24.820 --> 53:29.860
So blue and yellow, I guess the blue the game uses a blue and yellow sign with a

53:29.860 --> 53:36.820
Scandinavian name on the outside or on the store on a blue box like building yellow vertical

53:36.820 --> 53:42.180
stripes shirts identical to those worn by IKEA personnel. A great path on the floor furniture

53:42.180 --> 53:46.260
looks like IKEA furniture into which is funny though because the developers like I just bought

53:46.260 --> 53:54.260
a I just bought a cheap furniture pack on like the unity assets store for this. This is all

53:54.900 --> 54:01.300
foregoing or they're basically saying all foregoing immediate suggests that the game

54:01.300 --> 54:08.180
takes place in an IKEA store. Like unfortunately, he's probably gonna have to change the way like

54:08.820 --> 54:13.700
the outside of the store looks which is weird because you don't ever see it. It's only in the

54:13.700 --> 54:21.380
menu like the start menu. But I mean, obviously, he's not gonna fight it. You know, $25 billion.

54:22.180 --> 54:27.140
Yeah, I but I think IKEA is doing a pretty shitty thing here. You know, I also, you know,

54:27.140 --> 54:30.900
somebody I already know somebody's type in the comment, they have to chase their trademarks,

54:30.900 --> 54:37.060
or they they might. He's not calling it. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm with pod culture. It doesn't just

54:37.060 --> 54:42.740
fall under parody. Like, wouldn't you can't you do something that's similar, but it's also

54:42.740 --> 54:48.100
distinctly different. And like, he didn't call it IKEA. He called it something else. And he didn't

54:48.100 --> 54:52.420
lift the actual brand names. He's calling them something else. And I think it's very obvious

54:52.420 --> 54:57.700
when you look at the fact like it's a horror game, that any reasonable person would know that like,

54:57.700 --> 55:04.020
when you actually go to IKEA, you're not going to be having a horror experience. Like I in Dark

55:04.020 --> 55:11.460
Saga is still in China. It falls under parody. Yeah. And brings up when the in the 90s. And

55:11.460 --> 55:17.220
Marvel Comics, McDonald's was called Mac food. Yeah, and pop culture says they should embrace

55:17.220 --> 55:23.060
it instead run with it. I mean, they can, but I don't know because you know what they're doing

55:23.060 --> 55:27.700
here. I don't know if I would call it Streisand effect. I don't think it's quite that. But I would

55:27.700 --> 55:32.500
say this game now is getting all of this additional media coverage that it would not have gotten if

55:32.500 --> 55:36.820
IKEA didn't send this letter. I'm not sure that's exactly Streisand effect. But it's it's it's in

55:36.820 --> 55:42.260
the same family. And it's in the he could probably just change outside of that store to make it look

55:42.260 --> 55:46.580
slightly different. So it doesn't it's not like IKEA. It doesn't really matter. But

55:47.220 --> 55:55.220
but I think it's weird Al does an album cover that is really similar to, you know, an established

55:55.220 --> 55:59.700
like, you know, what the what was his album that how the Michael Jackson parodies on it that looked

55:59.700 --> 56:04.580
just like the bad album? Like, come on. He does this all the time with his album covers. And it's

56:04.580 --> 56:10.740
like, you know, people understand. It's, it's a joke. It's a parody. Like a reasonable person

56:10.740 --> 56:14.900
understands the difference. That's true. Dark soccer does say he had a good relationship with

56:14.900 --> 56:18.900
Michael Jackson. That's true. I'd heard that Michael Jackson, like allowed him to use the same

56:18.900 --> 56:26.420
set, even. So he did fair, fair, but come on. It's still that even if he didn't, if he,

56:27.620 --> 56:31.860
you know, we all know that Coolio had a problem with it. And there was really nothing that could

56:31.860 --> 56:37.700
be done. Yes, they made amends and so forth. Yes, that all got, you know, resolved later on,

56:37.700 --> 56:43.700
but it was an issue at first, right? So it's just, you know, I just I don't understand why

56:43.700 --> 56:50.740
he can't just say suck it like it's parody. This falls and plus, if I isn't this being I believe

56:50.740 --> 56:58.340
the lawyer. So the company is in Sweden. The lawyer is in New York, but the game makers in

56:58.340 --> 57:07.300
Europe. So how are you gonna how are you gonna fight that? I don't think you do. Yeah. So I just

57:08.580 --> 57:12.740
I think these lawyers did this game maker a favor at the end of the day, to be quite honest.

57:13.860 --> 57:18.500
Yeah, we'll see. I mean, it's definitely gotten a lot more publication than it would have. But I

57:18.500 --> 57:23.300
hope the creator like I guess if they feel a need to change the color, make it you know what,

57:23.300 --> 57:27.460
honestly, make it a yellow store with blue lettering. And then that's it. Don't change

57:27.460 --> 57:33.780
anything else. Don't change anything else. And just say it's very, God, shut up. All right.

57:33.780 --> 57:41.140
Let's talk about Digital Eclipse, which is a company that has made a lot of great

57:41.140 --> 57:44.180
retro kind of revival sorts of games. You know, they've published a lot of

57:44.980 --> 57:50.180
I want to say they did a lot of the Castlevania stuff recently with Konami and so forth. They've

57:50.180 --> 57:55.620
been doing, you know, retro packages and stuff like that on modern consoles for a long time.

57:55.620 --> 57:59.300
Most recently, they did the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Cowabunga collection.

57:59.940 --> 58:07.460
They put out a new game for Halloween. But it's actually not a classic game. This is a new game

58:07.460 --> 58:13.780
that's retro inspired. So it's a game called Candy Creeps. And you can play it with one or two

58:13.780 --> 58:20.820
players. And it's a retro arcade like performer, platformer, excuse me, where you take you go out

58:20.820 --> 58:27.220
against the pump king who stole candy. Oh, no. And you have to do like Mario Brothers, the original,

58:27.780 --> 58:32.420
like jumping on, like, you know, stomping heads and things like that. So apparently this is the

58:32.420 --> 58:37.620
first in what Digital Eclipse is going to do as an arcade line. And they're just calling it

58:37.620 --> 58:43.860
New Games Inspired by Classic 80s Arcade Vibes. So that's kind of neat. If you want to get it,

58:43.860 --> 58:52.260
it will cost you $4.99 US dollars on itch.io. Or if you sign up for the Digital Eclipse

58:52.260 --> 58:57.140
mailing list by tomorrow, Halloween, which might actually be today for many of you listening on

58:57.140 --> 59:01.620
the podcast, you can get it for free. So you can sign up for the Digital Eclipse mailing

59:01.620 --> 59:05.700
list by doing that. The URL, unfortunately, is a little long. So you'll probably have to Google

59:05.700 --> 59:10.420
it because I can't read it out here to you. But that is the way you can get it free or just check

59:10.420 --> 59:16.020
it out on itch.io if you want as well. So yeah, I think that's, that's, hey, I'm all about a free

59:16.020 --> 59:23.780
game. And I like a retro game, right? So it all works. So, well, speaking of retro games,

59:23.780 --> 59:27.460
I think this is a good opportunity to get into our next segment.

59:38.180 --> 59:43.700
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

59:43.700 --> 59:48.580
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

59:57.300 --> 01:00:05.140
Hello and welcome to the classic game of the week. This game, appropriately, is Halloween

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:12.260
for the Atari 2600. It was developed by Micrographic Image, published by Wizard

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:21.540
Video, designed by Tim Martin and Robert Barber. It was released on the Atari 2600 in October 1983.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:32.500
And it is based off of the 1978 horror movie of the same name. The interesting thing about this

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:38.660
game is that it doesn't have any of the characters named, including the killer. You just sort of have

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:45.860
to assume it's Michael Myers, even though the cover art for the box is the movie poster.

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:54.500
So the way that you play this game is that you play a babysitter who has to save children

01:00:54.500 --> 01:01:02.500
from a knife wielding killer. So what you do is you have to take them to safe rooms located

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:09.780
at both ends of each floor of the house and or by stabbing the killer with the knife.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:17.140
If it can be found, you advance by either rescuing five children or stabbing the killer twice.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:22.980
As the levels progress, the killer gets faster and faster and it's game over when all of your

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:29.300
three lives are lost. Now, there was some controversy about this game. Number one,

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:38.020
this game had gore. Well, Atari 2600 level gore, but gore nonetheless. There were these scenes

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:44.180
where after one of the victims is stabbed that blood is showing actually squirting from their

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:54.660
body. For Atari 2600, that's gore. And people were really put off by that. They thought it was too

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:04.180
violent. Many retailers refused to carry the game. And the other game released by Wizard Video,

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:08.740
the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, also after a horror movie around the same time.

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:17.140
They actually ran out of money and went bankrupt. So while they were shipping out some of the games,

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:21.940
they didn't have labels on them. Instead, they had masking tape that said Halloween

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:26.740
handwritten on it. A lot of retailers rejected the game because of this.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:33.460
And while it wasn't a great game, it really isn't. It was still better received than the

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:40.660
Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And because the limited numbers of it is now a highly valued item amongst

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:47.780
Atari collectors. Trust me, look on eBay and look at what they go for. And if you have one of these,

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:51.380
give it to me. I'm kidding. Actually, no, I'm not. Send it to me. I want it,

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:56.580
even though it's not a great game. But that is our classic game of the week,

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:01.060
Halloween. And as for all of y'all, Happy Halloween.

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:08.580
All right. There it is the classic game of the week, Halloween on the Atari 2600,

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:14.580
which I have to admit, I forgot that they did a Halloween on the Atari 2600. I completely forgot.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:21.780
I know some of the classic movie based Atari 2600 games like E.T.

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:28.500
But I forgot there was Halloween. So there's that. Dark Soccer is actually in chat saying,

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:34.660
I worked really hard on that. They know it was nice, especially for those that were able to

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:39.220
see the visuals here live on Twitch. But it still works on the podcast feed as well. But yeah, so

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:44.180
Jamie's actually teased that she might do more of those prerecorded so she can do some more

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:48.660
fun stuff with the visuals there. So, you know, if you liked that, tell Jamie you want to see more.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:54.660
Fifth Dream also says pork meat. And also, we could probably put those videos on our

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:58.820
YouTube channel. Hint, hint. So that, you know, a little something extra, you know,

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:06.340
on there. So something to think about. Fifth Dream says Porky's. Oh, God. Yeah, that was a

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:13.380
terrible movie. And yeah, I forgot there was that game as well. My gosh, my gosh. All right. Anyway,

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:17.860
all right. We're going to get right back into it and travel around the industry and check out some

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:25.780
other news going on quite rapidly and rapid fire news. So, yes, Loki and rapid Witcher news. We

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:31.700
have the news that Henry Cavill is going to be not appearing in the fourth season of The Witcher

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:37.140
on Netflix, probably because he's going to be Superman again. And so instead we're getting

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:45.140
Liam Hensworth. And nobody's excited about that. But Superman, that's good.

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:50.180
Why? Why do we hate him? Besides the fact he's Miley Cyrus's ex? Like,

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:55.300
is there celebrity gossip I'm missing? I don't know. Probably it's he's not as cool as Henry

01:04:55.300 --> 01:05:01.220
Cavill. But man, I don't care. I didn't watch any of the seasons of The Witcher, so it doesn't

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:07.060
matter to me. I know some people very depressed about this news. I get it. Like, it's weird to

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:11.700
change the star right in the middle of the show. You don't see that happen a lot. I mean, it's

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:18.260
happened before. Well, I think the new Witcher is not supposed to have Gerald either. It's supposed

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:25.060
to be a different Witcher. So maybe they do that. And I don't know. And the chat is pointing out

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:30.340
this is because Henry Cavill is going to be busy as Superman. Yes. Right. Exactly. I mean,

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:35.380
I'm probably not supposed to. I don't know. I don't follow movies enough. But apparently,

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:39.220
Superman shows up in one of these recent DC movies. And it's very obvious. Well,

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:44.740
we just had the news recently, right? Like, one of those big directors on that had done the Marvel

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:49.860
side of the house, right? Is now going to be over like a new DC movie because everybody,

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:54.660
everybody knows the DC movies. Not great. But like, they're restructuring that whole thing.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:06:00.660
I think I was reading somewhere, right? James Gunn, thank you. And pot culture says he did

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:08.260
do some DC as well. Yeah, he did the last Suicide Squad movie. And I liked that. I liked that movie.

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:12.900
It was pretty good. What I watched, Wonder Woman, I hear was a big exception to Wonder

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:18.660
Woman movies are pretty good. Yeah, the Wonder Woman movies are good. Would I watch more DC

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:25.940
because of that? Probably not. I hear that. Shazam is pretty good.

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:35.140
Yeah, I don't know about Black Adam. Some people like Black Adam. But once again,

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:39.460
this is so funny. sj 100. Matt and Chad says Liam Liam Hensworth

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:43.780
is to Chris Hemsworth as Billy Baldwin is to Alec Baldwin ouch.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:47.380
Ouch.

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:54.260
Well, we're gonna say are you saying as Eric Roberts is to Julia Roberts? Is that what you're

01:06:54.260 --> 01:07:04.660
saying? Anyway, go ahead. We're getting a remake of the very first Witcher game in Unreal five.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:11.300
So that's going to be worked on as well by CG product red. So that sounds cool.

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:16.180
Maybe I'll have Liam Hemsworth as a drought. No one.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.860
Maybe not. If you're Liam Hemsworth, though, how excited are you?

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:29.220
Like you're, you're having a great week. If you're just give him a chance, I guess. I don't know.

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:36.740
But yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's talk about the arcade archives series, which, you know,

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:41.540
is on Nintendo Switch, and I believe ps4 and therefore bs5 by association, you know,

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:47.620
there are a lot of there's over 100 games in the arcade archive series, and they're still coming.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.540
And just recently announced another game that we're going to be seeing in arcade archives is

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:59.060
ordain. ordain is a game that was released in Japanese arcades in 1988. It's it's similar in

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:05.220
some aspects to Parodius. But in ordain, you are playing a professor that takes to the skies to

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:10.500
rescue his kidnapped sweetheart, who's been deducted by his rival. So yeah, get very,

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:16.820
very standard 80s storyline there. But yeah, it's very, very colorful little shooter type game. So

01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:21.620
it's cute. There was a port on the PC engine. But since of course, this is the arcade archives,

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:27.620
we are talking about the arcade version. So yeah, this is actually also the first time this game has

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:32.180
shown up in the West. It has never been on a Namco collection of any sort or anything like that. So

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:37.540
that's kind of interesting, too. So pretty cool. All right, let's travel around the world and check

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:42.660
out some games you're going to be able to get this week as well. That one is one I think that's

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.740
coming out very soon digitally. But what's coming to the more traditional game stores lucky this

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:53.140
week. We have lonesome village on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation five and Xbox series.

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:58.980
Doraemon story of seasons friends of the great kingdom on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation

01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:10.260
five. Sumiko, Grashi, Mina de rhythm party on Nintendo Switch. We have the chant on PC,

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:20.420
PlayStation five and Xbox series, ghost song on PC, Iron Man VR on PC, harvest Stella on

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:28.740
PC and Nintendo Switch. Nikkei goddess of victory on Android and iOS. And that's it.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:36.180
All right. Let's go over to Japan and check out some of the releases that are coming out over

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:41.460
there. And then I'll ask Loki to do the UK dates with Dark Soccer out this week. But coming out in

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:47.460
Japan, we have on the Nintendo Switch we have Sumiko, Grashi, Mina de rhythm party, which I

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:51.700
think I heard Loki mentioned as well. That is a game that's coming out. I wonder what kind of

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:58.020
rhythm party it is. It looks like it looks like they're all singing in this game. You press

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:02.660
buttons and shake the joy cons to the rhythm of the music. Well, that sounds like samba de amigo

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:06.020
or something. That sounds like it could be fun. That's really the only major release on the

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:12.260
Nintendo Switch this week. Yeah, it does look a little like bear things. Going over to the

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:17.620
PlayStation five this week we have Doraemon story of seasons friends of the great kingdom

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:23.140
that is out from Bandai Namco this week on the PS five and that is that's really the only major

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:28.420
release in Japan this week. It's kind of a slow week in Japan. I will say though next week. Where's

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:32.740
Tiger Claw? Tiger Claw? Where are you? Tiger Claw? Pay attention because next week in Japan,

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:38.100
and I think this actually might be the entire world as well. But I noticed that Sonic Frontiers

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:41.620
is November 8. And that's gonna be that's gonna be a big one for some people. So

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:48.020
worldwide as a worldwide release. So check that out. November 8. All right. How about the UK

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:55.140
Loki and in lieu of Dark Sakura not being here tonight? The UK we've got train sim world three

01:10:55.140 --> 01:11:04.180
on PlayStation and Xbox horsetails on PlayStation and the switch. The chance is that never mind.

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:09.060
Just go ahead. Keep reading. I don't know. It doesn't say it's Emerald Valley Ranch. So

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:16.820
I don't think no, I don't think that that is Sarah Jessica Parker. Okay. Actually,

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:26.020
the chant on PlayStation and Xbox we have a tourney am Noctis on PlayStation and the switch

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:33.860
humankind heritage edition on PlayStation. We have death's door on PlayStation and switch

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:42.580
harvest Stella on the switch brats flaunt your fashion on PlayStation, Xbox and the switch.

01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:50.340
It takes two on the switch Ghostbusters spirits unleashed collector's edition on the PlayStation.

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:55.620
And that's it. All right. We have a few more stories for you. And then we're going to be

01:11:55.620 --> 01:12:01.940
opening up our discord server to some phone calls. If you want to give us a call over at vog

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.860
network.com slash discord. And even if you don't want to call us, if you're listening on the

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:10.180
podcast feed, for example, you're not here live tonight, you can always leave some messages and

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:14.020
some notes in the orange launch radio channel or any of our discussion channels throughout the

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:19.300
week. I do read and actively participate in the OLR chat. So and I know Loki has an eye on that

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:24.500
too. Dark soccer, dark soccer makes a cameo once in a while the discord server, but she's there too.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.740
And so you know, if you want to chat with us throughout the week, you can do that over the

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:34.580
discord server. So I just urge y'all to join, we limit our use of at everyone. In fact,

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:39.220
we don't use it. So don't worry about that type of spam, even though it is good,

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:42.980
whenever I joined a new discourse or anytime I joined a new discourse or that's the first thing

01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:47.460
I turn off. And I think anyone out there who's considering setup, setting up a discord server,

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:53.060
please realize the app feature has been ruined for everybody. So I would just assume any discord

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:56.820
server you set up those features are not going to do any good because everybody's turning them off

01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:01.780
now. So something to think about anyway. Moving on, we're gonna get back into a few news stories.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:06.020
Unfortunately, these are not the great kind of news stories here. We've had some passings in our

01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:10.260
industry this week. But let's take a moment to remember and acknowledge those that we've lost

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:19.140
this last week, Loki. Yeah, we have Reiko Kodama, who was a developer at Sega. She had worked on

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:27.220
quite a few different things, including Phantasy Star, Skies of Acadia, Alex Kidd, Sonic.

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.260
This is like the golden age of Sega, like all those games, right?

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:40.580
Yeah. So she started with the company back in 1984. And pretty much worked on a lot of stuff

01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:48.660
during like the pixel art days, I guess. So gosh, she was labeled the first lady of RPGs.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:55.300
And award a Pioneer Award at GBC 2018. I heard the way that we kind of found out

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:59.780
about this was because they put us very small tribute to her in the Mega Drive 2

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:04.740
that came out recently, the mini, the new like Genesis, yeah, to that hold the Sega Mini 2

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:10.420
thing that came out recently. And they put a small tribute and somebody had actually tweeted going,

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:15.460
you know, usually when you say in memory of so and so that per and they actually confirmed

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:22.180
she unfortunately passed away. So that's sad. Yeah, she was 59. That's way too young.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:28.260
That's too bad. And speaking of way too young, someone on the more contemporary side of games,

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:34.340
someone you probably heard if you ever played the game Death Stranding also passed away just within

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:41.380
the last couple days. The frontman of the band Low Roar, his name was Ryan Karajia. I hope I

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:46.740
said that right, passed away at the age of 40. That's Oh my gosh, I mean, that's our age. So

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:52.100
that's really depressing. And this was confirmed, unfortunately, via the band social media pages.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:59.300
Hideo Kojima, of course, the mind behind Death Stranding, really pouring out the condolences

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:05.460
on Twitter about the vocalist of this game, or excuse me, the vocalist of Low Roar, because of

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:13.220
the impact that the music had on Death Stranding. The song All Keep Coming played in the very first

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:18.660
trailer for Death Stranding. A song called Don't Be So Serious was one of the first tracks you would

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.940
hear during the opening scene of the game. I guarantee you, if you've heard the song,

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.860
you've ever played the game like, Oh, this, I remember this, the first time I heard this song,

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:33.300
so it's very, very important in setting the tone for that game. So yeah, on Low Roar social media

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:39.940
post, they paid tribute to Kara Zizia, calling him the driving force behind Low Roar, crediting

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:45.620
him for music and lyrics and his haunting voice, which again, if you've heard the songs, very,

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:50.740
very unfortunate. They did mention that they did record their sixth studio album, and that would

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:57.060
be the last project from Ryan and it will be released when it's ready. No date there. So

01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:02.740
uh, in the statement of tweet, a series of tweets, Hideo Kojima said, you know, expressed his shock

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:08.820
over this saying the game would not have been complete Death Stranding without Low Roar's music.

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:15.860
So very sad. So kind of a, you have a classic, uh, game maker and a contemporary game contributor

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:22.340
really, you know, on both ends there, unfortunately losing both this week. So that stinks. Uh, we have

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:27.620
a few more stories in the meantime. Uh, Loki, I'm curious about this next one. This sounds

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:34.100
interesting. Yeah. So Sega is looking to do an intend, don't, and that is, they're going to make

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:43.460
making a super game. That's going to be coming out by March, 2026. Um, this is a super game project

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:48.900
that they don't really, they're not really talking about it, but apparently it's some large scale

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:55.540
game that they're working on. Uh, one key to achieving this goal is whether we can, uh, draw

01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:00.340
together a large community involving not only players, also streamers who stream the game and

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.820
viewers who watch their videos, that kind of community expands the further development game

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:09.700
content, adding value to the game. It's unimagined by developers sparking broader movement, which

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:14.820
they can draw on even more user base, blah, blah, blah. Um, sounds to me something like, uh,

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:19.860
you know, very like a sandbox type, you know, like a Minecraft or like a Fortnite or something

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:26.900
like that, where there's kind of a growing progression of content for the game driven by

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:33.700
fans of it and stuff. So interesting. Don't know what that would be, but it's,

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:39.460
it's very ambitious then it's not something we're going to see anytime soon, but neat.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:48.580
I don't know what it's about.

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:01.540
Oh, I'm sorry. My mic's been off this whole time. Oh my gosh. Uh, I was, I was, uh,

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:06.740
sorry for the awkward silence there, but, um, I was typing. I try to mute myself when I type

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:11.220
so that the clicking doesn't come through and I'm not always successful. So I was just joking that,

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:15.940
the next step now is to get an announcement of the announcement because that's, that's the first

01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:21.060
thing we have to do. Right. And I'm very curious about, um, what this game is all about. So yeah,

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:26.100
it's, it's hype before that we even know what they're hyping up. Yeah, exactly. Right. All

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:33.220
right. Um, last and least, um, tonight, uh, I said I was really done talking about this,

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:37.700
but unfortunately the news keeps coming and I have to mention what happened this week in the

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:44.500
Bayonetta voice actor saga. Yes, I'm going back to that topic. Here's what happened this week.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.780
So Helena Taylor, of course, you know, she said in some tweets this week,

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.260
my posts have hit a nerve with people. Low pay resonates, not just in the gaming industry,

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:57.940
but in the wider world beyond all over the planet to do it, donate your boycott money.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:03.860
There are many small local charities that can help. And there were some traditional charities

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:07.940
that were there, like some food banks and some organizations that helped with the homeless and

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:12.180
things like that. Uh, there were some other organizations that were in there as well. She said

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:17.860
that these were organizations. She contributed her supplemental income from her convention

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:25.540
appearance. I think singular too. Um, but anyway, it was very interesting. Some of the other, uh,

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:30.020
charities that were mentioned here, uh, the student pizza fund for the London Academy of Music

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:34.580
and Dramatic Arts. That's fine. Pet welfare groups. Sure. But there was another interesting

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:42.340
one that stood out. Billboards for life. This is an organization that makes roadside propaganda

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:48.020
with, uh, it's basically anti-abortion propaganda. For example, um, fetuses that are showing in the

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:54.660
praying position, uh, quotes that say I could dream before I was born and so forth. Um, so

01:19:55.460 --> 01:20:02.980
Helena Taylor is using her campaign to, um, urge people to donate to an anti-abortion, uh, charity,

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:07.780
which there's not, I mean, some people would agree with that, but, um, there are a lot of other

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:14.180
people that would not agree with that stance. Um, so it's, um, you know, again, it's a lot of people

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:20.580
are sort of questioning what exactly was her motivation with this whole thing and so forth.

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:24.900
I really have nothing else to say on all of this. I, I'm just going to point to,

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:32.900
I done said it already three weeks ago here on this show, and I told you then, um, if this was

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:40.180
the tweet that finally woke you up to what's going on, congratulations. Um, I accept apologies in the

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:46.660
form of Venmo and cash app payments. I'm just kidding. Tell a friend about the show. That's

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:52.020
all we really want to happen here at orange launch radio, but needless to say, when I said

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:58.500
she would never work in the game industry again, she's not going to now I do like this and thank

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:03.860
you quest buster for pointing this out because this is very, uh, very important to point out

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:09.940
the, another voice actress within Bayonetta three, Anna Brisbane, she voices a new character named

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:14.260
Viola, and she was able to kind of, you know, unmask this week. Cause the game is now out.

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:22.100
She can say, yes, I did this. She did a charity run raising $5,000 for various trans rights groups.

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:29.460
And I, I, that is a very well, well, it's a great cause to begin with. And I don't, I don't,

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:35.620
you know, I don't want to make, uh, these charity organizations, you know, any sort of like, I don't

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:42.980
even want to use the word joke, but my point is this is very much a tongue in cheek kind of,

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:47.780
I think, counterpoint to a lot of what we've been talking about these last three weeks.

01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:53.460
And I think this is Anna Brisbane sort of coming out and saying, don't worry. I'm not like her.

01:21:55.380 --> 01:22:00.180
I really think it is, but she's not saying that, but she's saying that.

01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:06.820
So, uh, but congrats to Anna Brisbane on that role. Uh, and, uh, Bayonetta three's been getting

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:10.580
pretty good reviews across the board. I'm not sure it's quite as up there as Bayonetta two,

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:14.900
but to still be even in the eighties, high eighties at that and getting some perfect

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:19.540
review scores from some websites on your third game is still pretty good. So, um,

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:26.100
I, I congratulations to Anna Brisbane, of course, Jennifer Hale, uh, uh, congratulations to platinum

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:30.580
on the, you know, games release and all that stuff. Uh, and none for Helena Taylor. Bye.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:36.580
All right. That's it. That's all the news we had for tonight. So now we want to invite

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:40.340
one last minute story. If you want. Yes, of course, because I was going to say,

01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:43.860
we usually would read some emails here to participate at orange,

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:49.460
lot of trader.com, but guess what? We still don't have emails. I'm starting to wonder if anyone

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:55.060
emails anymore. We get the occasional from Y Y R Ziba or entertainment. I'm not here to name names.

01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:59.940
I'm just saying. I only noticed there's probably less than five people that have emailed us in the

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:03.780
past like six months. And this is why I always threatened to get rid of the mailbag segment.

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:08.340
But at the same time, I don't really have anything where people are engaging to replace it with.

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:17.860
So that's why the mailbag still lives on for now, but now seeking engagement platform to get more

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:23.300
voices on the show through. So if you have some thoughts, I'm very curious. Uh, Bobby says he

01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:29.460
has breaking news. I'd be very curious to hear that. Oh, that's great news. Guess what? Bobby

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:34.900
just breaking on the show. Do you do if you want to hop in the green room, Bobby,

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:42.340
or just barge on in, I don't give a shit and tell us here live on air. You can tell us if you want.

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:45.860
I'll read it if you don't want to do it for whatever reason. Uh, Loki though, what's your,

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.660
what's your last minute topic here? Well, not to be Debbie downer here, but, um,

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:57.620
Adriana Chechik has returned back to stream since her accident at TwitchCon where she broke her back

01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:03.300
in two places. Right. Um, she talked a little bit about her recovery and also gave the bad news

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:09.620
saying that unfortunately at the time she didn't know that she was pregnant at the time of the

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:18.260
injury and surgery. She lost Loki. That's horrible. Oh, I wish you'd warned me. That's Oh, that's

01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:24.660
awful. Oh my God. I think that definitely the people behind TwitchCon have to pay for that

01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:29.300
for sure. They need to, somebody needs to answer for that.

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:36.580
Holy moly. Cause I mean, not only could you have killed like some of the adults there,

01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:41.460
but you did, you did kill somebody. So it's just, it's horrible.

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:47.220
I literally have no words and I'm about to just press the end of the show button. So

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:53.140
anyway, um, do you have anything else please to, to palette reset or something that's,

01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:57.460
that's really, that's, that's, that's hard. I saw a cool picture of, uh, somebody that made us,

01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:01.700
uh, one of those century bots from portal out of a pumpkin. That was fun. Okay. Yeah.

01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:07.460
As soon as Matt says someone throw a pie, uh, Loki, go hit yourself in the face of the pie,

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:12.900
please. All right. Actually, here, here's, uh, we're going to welcome Bobby Black Wolf on, um,

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:16.100
because I know Bobby had just got some really good news and I definitely want to hear like,

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:22.020
what's going on. So hi, Bobby, are you there? Yeah, I am. Hang on. Give me a second here.

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:25.940
Cause I haven't done this pie before. I know. No, I don't think you've been on our side of

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:29.620
the house in quite a while. So, and I got to make sure you're very loud, but that's okay. It's,

01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:34.820
it's on my side, not your side. All right. Oh, Bobby's coming through a video. Great.

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:40.180
Here we go. Hi, how are you? Yeah. All right. Post-show area. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:45.540
I'm great. So the chat knows your news, but the podcast listeners don't yet. So tell me,

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:49.860
tell me the news. Cause I think this is really exciting. Yeah. So I just got the email

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:56.340
literally like, what is Gmail saying here? Uh, three minutes ago, three minutes ago. Uh,

01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:01.140
but, uh, I am one of the 22 volunteers selected to be a host for awesome games done quick 2023.

01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:08.660
Applause. Applause. Congratulations. Cause it's never guaranteed. It is never guaranteed. You,

01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:14.340
uh, you re audition every time, which is good because, um, then we'd never get any new blood in

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:20.420
and there are people that have auditioned, you know, or there are people who've hosted

01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:26.100
HDQ in the past, maybe done seven or eight events that can't get in anymore. Uh, and it's, but,

01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:30.180
and it's a good thing that we let new blood come in because some people are like, well, you know,

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:35.140
why don't they just have like a set of hosts that they trust that can do, you know, that are there

01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:40.020
all the time. There are only 22 spots in that list is longer than 22 people. So how do you pick

01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:49.140
from the 22 trusted veterans on, you know, when you have more than 22. So I am, I am, uh,

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:53.780
I am thrilled and excited and I have to probably be posting on social media tonight. So I wanted

01:26:53.780 --> 01:27:00.180
to give you the heads up here on board scope. I'm very excited. That's great. And so for,

01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:04.420
for your audience who probably does, don't know what you actually have to do to audition. Uh,

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:08.820
and I can, I can talk a little bit about it, but I don't want to get too much into it, but, uh,

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:13.060
we're not even at an hour and a half. So by all means, give us a peek behind the curtain.

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:18.900
We got time. Absolutely. Um, so, uh, essentially what they have you do is they give you a video

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:26.420
file and you then they say, okay, here's a list. Here's some sponsor blurbs and here's a bunch of

01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:31.380
donations. They give that to you in, in, in like a Google doc and there's a video and the video

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:36.260
has two minutes of just nothing. That's the time between games. And then the first six minutes of

01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:41.300
a speed run. And during the speed run, the runner will be like, okay, now let's throw, you know,

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:44.820
let's have some donations and you're supposed to read some donations. So they're checking

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:52.740
how you structure your two minutes of you talking and then how you determine which donations to read

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:58.580
and what you say during the speed run. And they'll even say, uh, the runner is looking for us,

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:02.260
this specific community member, they're a friend. They want to hear their donation.

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:06.340
They'll say things like, you know, we're really trying to push for this or please, you know,

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:12.500
promote this part, you know, this prize or this, you know, this upcoming speed run, a bonus game,

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:17.380
whatever. Uh, they'll actually, they'll tell you that. And then you put in that thing, uh,

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:24.420
your eight minutes you uploaded is an unlisted YouTube video. And then they get, uh, 20 amazing

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:30.660
volunteers. I almost said suckers, but 20 amazing volunteers or 25 amazing volunteers or something.

01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.980
They have to listen to everybody's audition and they watch everybody's audition and then they

01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:40.900
score them on several subjective and objective things. So there's scores about, you know,

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:44.820
you get an extra point. If you read this donation, you lose a point. If you read this donation,

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:49.380
then it all averages together. But they also have some subjective things. Were they energetic? What's

01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:57.220
their tonal voice like stuff like that? 112 auditions. Each audition is about eight minutes

01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:03.940
long. Oh my gosh. And they selected 22. Congratulations. There were 17. There were

01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:10.500
17 judge volunteers. I'm getting to this part of the email. They send stats. Um, and, uh, yeah.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:16.980
And it's basically, it's a score out of 50. Uh, the 22 people had to score 42 out of 50. What'd

01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:21.940
you get? What'd you get? I don't know. They don't tell me what I get yet. Okay. Um, I have to

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.780
actually ask, I can get feedback and then I get like the judge's comments and so I can figure out

01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:32.580
what I'm going to work on. Uh, but, uh, the high score was 45.8. Oh, so nobody, nobody gets a

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:36.580
perfect score. No, no, nobody's ever gotten a perfect score. I think like one time somebody

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:42.340
got like over a 46, but usually like in the 45 is your high score. So there is, there's only like

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:49.380
three points separating first and number one and number 22. And then there are six backups

01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:55.220
who scored more than 41 points, but less than 42. And that was six. So there were six people

01:29:55.220 --> 01:30:01.380
that placed in the 41. And the first time I did this SGDQ 2020, I was in that backup group. Yeah.

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:07.460
I had just missed the cutoff line, but still that's great because you've done every single

01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:12.740
one since. So, but I know, I know you work on your craft and you listen to the feedback and you've,

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:16.820
um, you know, kind of talked to others within the community and I'm sure you all kind of, you know,

01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:20.340
talk about what works and what doesn't work. And that just helps I'm sure at the end of the day.

01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:27.060
So, yeah. Yeah. And the downside of, of, of the hosting audition process and, you know, I'm not,

01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:33.540
I don't mind talking about this is that it really helps that I've done it, done the actual event

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:37.220
because there's lots of things the judges look for that they don't tell you. And you'd only know if

01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:43.300
you ever did an event. And so that's why you do see a lot of the same people hosting in every each

01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:47.540
event. It's because once you've done one, you know what the judges are looking for and you know,

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:52.740
the little two things to put in that they don't tell you necessarily in the audition documents.

01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:56.980
Yeah. And I don't, I didn't, you know, people should not listen to that comment and read into

01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:01.700
it. Like, Oh, it's, it's rigged. That's not it. It's just that, you know, as again, you talked

01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:05.860
about that there was a subjectiveness to the energy. How do you know the appropriate level

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:11.140
of energy? Well, either you've listened to a lot of the, you know, in, in the past, because

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:16.180
certainly if somebody was over energetic, you know, you know, if you're talking about,

01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:20.660
let's talk about the prevent cancer foundation, you know, it's like, maybe that's a little too

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:26.340
much energy. Yeah. Yeah. But how do you know that? Unless you like, listen, you get that feedback

01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:30.340
and that sort of thing. So I, you know, again, cause, cause when you say it that way, there's,

01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:35.220
there's going to be people that will read into that, that, Oh, it's rigged. Cause you know,

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:38.660
you know how the internet works with the conspiracies. Yes. But it's not rigged.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:45.620
It's just, it's on the job experience helps. Yes. Yeah. And yeah. And so a lot of people

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:49.460
will sit there and they'll like redo theirs and stuff. And I will say mine wasn't the first take.

01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:54.260
They don't ask for your first take. They let you watch the video. You can see what the timing is

01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:58.340
supposed to be. You can read through the donations because they don't want you reading every donation

01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:02.100
because they throw in things that you shouldn't read on the air. And they're like, can you,

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:08.100
what's your judgment? And me doing this, my show and working with you and working with VOG,

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:12.820
doing this for 17 years, having to read chat comments in real time and react on the air

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:20.500
has helped a lot for sure with that. For sure. So, so I'm, I'm thrilled that I got in. I don't

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:25.380
know, like now I've got to tell them what I'm interested in hosting because the game list is

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:32.100
out 14. I know I, well, so that's, that's probably going to be an in-demand one though. It's going

01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:39.060
to be very in demand. So there's like Froude who I've hosted many things before. He didn't get in

01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:44.740
and I don't think there's any Yakuza runs in anyway. I'll have to check. Well, I mean,

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:49.140
I also understand they got to, they got to mix it up. They can't have the same thing every year.

01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:54.500
And also this is the, this is the one that is going to be virtual because it's virtual again.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:33:00.740
Yeah. We talked about, you know, a few weeks ago that they had to kind of not be in Florida

01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:05.860
anymore for a variety of reasons. And that is a risk that they're taking with that. So,

01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:09.780
and that's why there were over a hundred auditions. The, for SGDQ, I think there were

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:16.020
only like 90 something auditions. So because anybody around the world can, can be in your,

01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:21.140
you're now, you know, I was competing against people in Australia that wouldn't have been able

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:25.540
to make it to, to America. Couldn't afford to make it to America, you know, cause that's a lot of

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:31.060
money. They were able, they were in the mix and other people who probably still aren't comfortable

01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:35.780
with large gatherings, they were in the mix. So, you know, it was, it was a lot, it was probably

01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:40.980
a tougher competition this time around. So I'm just very thankful that I, that I get to work

01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:45.700
with them again. Very curious to see what summer looks like too, you know, with, you know, I know

01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:50.180
it's a ways out, but just, just very curious to see how that shapes up in light of what happened

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:54.340
with this one. But I know it's still going to be great. It's still the virtual ones have been

01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:59.300
awesome. A lot of people kind of think they should keep mixing the virtual with the in-person ones,

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:03.540
or at least, you know, have some out. So it's, it's cool that we are getting that. And yeah,

01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:07.460
I'm, I'm thrilled you get to be involved with that again. And very curious to see what you end

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:11.380
up posting, especially since there is no Yakuza one that would certainly have you with it.

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:15.780
Right. Yeah. There, there are some games in there and I've also gotten to meet people that I think

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:20.420
that are running and stuff. So I may be able to, you know, now that I've actually been a part of

01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:24.740
the community for, you know, a couple of times now, and I've gotten to meet some of the runners,

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:28.100
either working with them in the past or meeting them in Minneapolis when I was there.

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:35.140
You know, I, I may, you know, have some people that want me there. So that's, that's some runners

01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:39.540
that would, cause runners can ask for a specific host as well. It's not just one way. That's great.

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:44.580
So, so we'll see. The summer one will most likely be at that same hotel in Minneapolis. They're

01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:50.580
pretty happy with that arrangement. So it's, it's just, where is Awesome Games Done Quick 2024 going

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:55.860
to be? Because I think some of the stuff, the reason they moved it from Virginia to Florida was

01:34:55.860 --> 01:35:00.900
a, they wanted to be near a major airport and also they wanted it less likely that winter

01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:06.340
weather was going to affect it because it was happening in mid January. So it would be snowing

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:11.460
in Virginia and it's hard for people to get around if they're not from the area. Like I didn't want

01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:17.060
to drive up there, you know, that's why I loved magfest in March that one time. Cause it was after

01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:23.060
all the winter weather stuff. I'm so now, as she says, move it to Atlanta. Wink, wink. I have a

01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:29.620
better idea. I'm just going to say it doesn't rain anymore here in, uh, you know, lovely Los Angeles

01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:36.580
or San Diego or Las Vegas would all be excellent choices that are all near major airports. I'm just

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:43.300
saying yes, but also what they're looking at is the cost. Well, but I, I would still argue Vegas

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:48.020
is always cheap, cheap hub, but yeah, I get it. I get it. They got to find the right match.

01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:52.500
And I, and I know people are saying move it to Atlanta and I'd love that too. Um,

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:57.220
because obviously we can handle it here. It's just the thing I worry about and I don't want

01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:02.820
to get into details or go on, go on about this, but, uh, Georgia has its own political problems.

01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:09.700
And so I'm not sure if the games done quick organization, which I have said is progressive

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:14.980
to a fault sometimes. Uh, I don't know if they would be comfortable being in Georgia. They

01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:19.380
wouldn't be comfortable being in Texas. So if this is the line that they're going to take,

01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:24.500
I can't see them coming to Georgia right now. And that's again, why Vegas jumps out at me

01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:29.060
as Vegas is more purple or Nevada is more of a purple state, right? So it's, it's, it's a

01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:34.100
very well-known swing state. So I, I, I kind of feel like, I don't know, Vegas, Vegas just

01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:38.900
is the solution to everything. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah. How about Georgia's purple too,

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:45.060
but it's just true, but the rules, we have the laws that are on the books can, can fair,

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:51.140
have some people take second, you know, not want to come here. Yeah, I get it. So we're,

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:55.780
we're working on it. I live here. We're working on it. Early voting is open right now in many

01:36:55.780 --> 01:37:03.620
States. It is here too. So I reminds I got to fill out my ballot. So yeah, I already did mine.

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:07.940
All right. Well, Bobby, I appreciate you coming back. I come in over on our show and giving us

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:13.060
that breaking news. And again, congratulations. They're lucky to have you, um, really look forward

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:17.140
to seeing what your trajectory and your path through that look, looks like and what games

01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:21.300
you're going to be involved with. So I'm looking forward to it. All right, Bobby, you take care.

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:26.900
Thanks for joining us tonight. Thank you. All right. Bye. All right. Always good to hear from

01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:31.220
Mr. Black Wolf here on OLR. He's good enough to have me on a show every week to promote what

01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:35.780
we're doing here. So I have no problem having him here. Uh, if you want to be on orange on radio,

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:39.460
you can hop in our green room, but you better do it real quick. Cause, uh, I'm about to think

01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:44.660
there's no calls that want to come, uh, in, uh, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:49.940
vog network. A lot of, uh, echoing of the go vote, uh, statements, Jaskren saying, go vote.

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:54.580
Dark to see us saying indeed already sent ours out with voting. Good, good. Okay. S Jonah Matt has a

01:37:54.580 --> 01:38:02.100
good question for us. What are your favorite TV Halloween specials on the Paul and Halloween

01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:09.940
special? Uh, my favorite specials on TV for Halloween are always the Simpsons Halloween

01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:14.420
episodes. The tree house, the new one that they have coming out now with the anime Simpsons,

01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:19.460
the death note. Yeah. I mean, I need to watch that tonight. Isn't it? Or is it next week? Yeah.

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:23.780
It's tonight. So, um, that looks awesome. But yeah, the Simpsons Halloween specials

01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:29.540
are always great. That's a really good answer. Um, that's good. Um, I don't know. I get more,

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:35.300
I don't really get into a lot of the Halloween ones. I mean, I always love a good Elvira

01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:38.820
appearance on television, but you know, she, Cassandra Peterson, isn't really performing

01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:43.860
that part. Like it's a very special occasion. She does, um, Elvira at this point. Um, I was

01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:48.900
going to say one other one. It's not TV, but since we live in the age of YouTube, uh, red

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:55.860
letter media's Halloween specials, their, um, best of the worst, all these, um, stuff is always good.

01:38:56.820 --> 01:39:00.500
Um, I'm looking in chat at some of the comments here as the show and Hunter Matt says they

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:04.740
brought back David S. Pumpkins last night. I forgot about that. That's good. Zen monkey

01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:10.340
11 says the worst, which that's a good pick is too. We love Tim Curry in that one. Uh,

01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:13.780
dark soccer is saying I'm going to be the Halloween special by playing Cenobite.

01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:23.940
You open the box. I came, so, uh, where will play night was good. It's short. It's only like 50

01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:30.180
minutes. Nice. All right. Uh, Dr. Sia says the great pumpkin Charlie Brown picked it up on DVD

01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:37.940
because I noticed it stopped airing on TV. Nice. All right. All right. Well, nobody else is in the

01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:41.780
green room, so guess what? We're going to wrap it up. We're done. We're out of here. We're gonna say

01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:46.180
good night. Good night. Let's get people's final thoughts and get on out of here for the night.

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:51.540
Um, Loki, what's your final thought? Oh, actually, wait, before I, before I get that, let me of

01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:55.540
course say as always, thank you so much for listening to orange launch radio. Thank you

01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:58.980
for being here tonight. Even though it was a little bit of a shorter show, we were down to

01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:04.500
host. It happens kind of a slower news week, but thank you for being here and being a part of the

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:08.660
community, whether you're here with us live or you are on our podcast feed throughout the week.

01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:12.740
We appreciate it. We'd love to hear from more podcast people, be it on our Twitter at OLR or

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:16.340
our mailbag. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend or

01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:19.780
two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:24.660
a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air, uh, in order to, uh, have them. So, uh,

01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:29.700
yeah, uh, a nice five star review wherever you found this show that goes an awful long way. So,

01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:36.020
uh, we really appreciate those. And, um, yeah, I, uh, I don't know what else to say. Uh, we won't

01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:39.700
be here in two weeks, but we definitely will be here next week. So we will see you all again next

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:45.620
week, uh, with another episode of the show. Now I'll go over to Loki and get your final thought

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:54.500
tonight. Um, go subscribe to my channel, I guess, low gal are at, um, YouTube. Great. They're going

01:40:54.500 --> 01:41:00.100
to be getting those. Uh, was it the, I don't know that they call on them now, but it's basically like

01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:06.900
a, a new URL thing that they're doing. Not nicknames, but it's like something I don't

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:16.260
know what they call it. Uh, aliases or something, right? Yes. Um, let's see. Um, oh dark soccer

01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:22.820
wants to remind people about the marathon that she's doing, uh, and I, I, I I'm okay. It was,

01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:27.060
I was about to say, is that still happening in light, but, uh, dark soccer does want to point

01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:33.140
out it's moved to February 15th in light of her own, uh, voice issues. It was going to be Tuesday,

01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:37.700
but she's just knocking it back two weeks. So, um, heads up on that. Uh, that is going to be

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:44.020
on February 15th from noon to midnight, 12 to 12. So, uh, check that out. A dark soccer. Again,

01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:47.540
she talked more about that on last week's show, but that is for, uh, to support some of the

01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:51.460
medical issues. Her mother's been going through, uh, recently. So if you want more on that list

01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:58.340
last week, but the date has changed to February 15th, uh, doctor's orders on that. Um, my final

01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:02.820
thought tonight. Um, I don't, I mean, I could plug my stuff, but I do that all the time. I

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:08.420
would just say I'm, I'm feeling really good about the show last night. I did live Rocky horror. The

01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:13.220
crowd was fantastic. I have been loving hosting and I've been getting to do a lot more of it

01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:18.420
this year because the last two years have been asked with COVID for live events. So I'm just

01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:22.820
really happy to be in the swing of that again. Oh, I'll tell you, I have not even said this on

01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:27.220
Twitter or anywhere. Cause I just found about it. I found out about it last night. I am hosting

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:32.980
another non horror event here locally. This is going to be a fun one. Loki, you could bring the

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:39.140
kids to this one. It's this kind of event. So I'm not saying you have to go, but, uh, December 10th

01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:44.740
here, I am going to be hosting a life or not life screening, but a screening of the movie home

01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:51.220
alone from the nineties. So, and we actually, yeah, we actually have one of the stars of the

01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:54.580
movie, not Macaulay Coke. And I'm sorry to say, it's not gonna be there, but, uh, one of the other

01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:59.300
kids, Angela Goethals, I think is the celebrity's name. She is going to be in attendance. So, and

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:03.780
it's a, they're calling it a non horror screening, uh, from love horror events. So it's going to be

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:08.260
a holiday thing. Um, so I'm really, really, really excited to do that. That's going to be December

01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:13.780
10th. So I guess that's my plug here locally for those of you in SAC love horror events.com. If

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:18.740
you want to see, um, all, I mean, it could be a horror screen if you, if you believe in the whole,

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:24.900
um, home alone in the saw universe thing. Well, and then if you look at a lot of like,

01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:29.940
what was, you know, like the, the, the, yeah, the traps that, you know, he was setting up for those

01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:34.100
burglars, it is kind of messed up. If you think about it, it could be a little bit scary. Um,

01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:39.620
I will also say they are doing a screening of sleepaway camp, the camp, uh, 1980s, uh,

01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:45.060
movie classic and the Angela or Felicia Rose will be in attendance for that one. Um, I am not

01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:48.500
hosting it. Unfortunately it is the same weekend. I'm out of town. It's the same weekend. We don't

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:52.740
have a show, but I just, I think it's really cool. They're doing that. So yeah, lots of fun

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:57.780
shows there. So anyway, um, that's it. We're out of here for tonight. Thank you again for, uh,

01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:01.460
staying up late with us and, uh, we'll see you in seven days. We'll do this all again. Hopefully

01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:05.220
dark soccer is clear to come back with us next week and we can all be together again to talk

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:10.740
about video games. Have fun playing games this week. Everyone. Good night. You've been listening
