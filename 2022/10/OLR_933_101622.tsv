0	14360	This week, Meta is pushing the Metaverse even further, and the term Metaverse is going
14360	16560	to be the only successful thing about Meta's initiative.
16560	21040	The legions of people who paid $1500 to Microsoft for an AR headset can do it again, now paying
21040	24320	Meta for what seems like good hardware and a sad lump of software.
24320	27640	Remember, a console is only as good as its games, and hardware is only as good as the
27640	28840	software you run on it.
28840	32440	This is my sarcasm dripping punditry, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie
32440	35720	Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35720	38280	Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
38280	46040	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
46040	48160	where every gamer has a voice.
48160	55960	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back and live once again with episode number 933
55960	60680	of our show for tonight, October the 16th of 2022.
60680	64120	We're back after not being here last week.
64120	68160	Dark Soccer and I were at TwitchCon, and I can't believe it's been an entire week since
68160	69160	TwitchCon.
69160	70160	It almost feels like an eternity ago.
70160	71160	But let me say hello.
71160	75320	Of course, I'm Rob Roberts, and over there, of course, is the previously mentioned Dark
75320	76880	Soccer, or Jamie Summers.
76880	77880	Hello.
77880	78880	Hi.
78880	79880	Hi.
79880	82680	I understand your voice is not in tip top shape tonight, but that has nothing to do
82680	83680	with TwitchCon.
83680	84680	Right?
84680	85680	That's, or maybe, I don't know.
85680	92760	I had a sinus infection, and I can't put the thing on over my headphones, but it's part
92760	93760	of my cosplay.
93760	94760	Yeah.
94760	98160	So for those that are listening on our podcast feed, because we do tape live every Sunday
98160	102620	night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network right after the Bobby Blackwolf
102620	106160	show at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, so you can watch us live.
106160	110680	But if you, of course, listen on the podcast feed, which is available on Spotify, iTunes,
110680	114680	all the major podcast platforms, you don't get the visuals, sadly.
114680	120360	But Dark Soccer was showing off a little bit of her pig cosplay, Pig being the killer from
120360	123860	Dead by Daylight, that's from the Saw franchise in movies.
123860	125640	So yeah.
125640	129360	So I will come back in just a moment, Dark Soccer, we'll talk more about TwitchCon.
129360	132840	But first, I have to say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
132840	133840	Hi, Loki.
133840	134840	Hello.
134840	135840	Did you have-
135840	136840	Pig being the pig from Babe.
136840	138240	It's a really weird game.
138240	140840	No, she was not cosplaying as that.
140840	144280	How was your week off?
144280	145280	Busy.
145280	146280	Yeah?
146280	147280	It's just working on video.
147280	150160	I was gonna say, you're pushing the Minecraft theme even harder.
150160	151880	I saw you put out another video.
151880	154880	You were doing like a team stream yesterday, right?
154880	156480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
156480	163000	So we did kind of a commentary stream on the Minecraft live stuff.
163000	166900	So they do their event and they have like all their announcements and everything.
166900	170540	So we did a co-stream with that.
170540	172000	Nice, nice.
172000	177420	So tell us quickly, what's the latest video about over on your YouTube channel, Loki O
177420	180340	L R on YouTube, if you're not already following which I'm doing.
180340	181340	So my latest-
181340	182340	Yep, yep.
182340	190260	So my latest Channel 64 episode, it revolves around me trying to try out for Sheriff because
190260	195460	there's Sheriff tryouts in our town of No Water because there's pillagers constantly
195460	199220	attacking so we need a Sheriff to like wrangle those up.
199220	202380	And so I'm not prepared.
202380	206620	And so in order to get prepared and do a lot in a short amount of time, you have to have
206620	208060	a montage.
208060	211100	And so I have a montage and it's hilarious.
211100	212100	So there's that.
212100	214940	And then I build a multi-item sorting system.
214940	220860	So big storage rooms, store everything because it's very key to get that all organized.
220860	224820	It makes projects in the future like way easier.
224820	227420	And there's a lot of lore, there's some lore thrown in there as well.
227420	229020	But it's pretty funny.
229020	233900	Jess 7X is in our chat right now saying best intro ever, massive 80s montage box.
233900	235260	Yes, Jess 6, yes.
235260	240900	In fact, I have Jess 6's latest video playing behind me as well because I would like to
240900	246940	showcase his stuff as well to your friend of mine on the Channel 64 SMP and does some
246940	251320	just incredible builds and just really entertaining content as well.
251320	252740	So go check him out as well.
252740	253740	Okay.
253740	256380	We just had an Illidan moment though.
256380	258900	You are not prepared.
258900	260460	From the old school Warcraft trailer?
260460	261460	Yes.
261460	266780	It's funny because so like, not to spoil too much, but like, it's basically we've been
266780	270620	thrown around, there's like this tiny little bit of lore that like kind of got introduced
270620	275980	in Arrington's video who's also on our server.
275980	279720	And so then I incorporated something with that as well.
279720	281840	And then now I incorporate something else with it.
281840	289020	So it's basically these, we're finding this hidden, like technology buried in the desert
289020	290020	type of stuff.
290020	294200	And so there's this quantum battery thing that keeps coming up that I ended up using
294200	297000	to almost like give myself superpowers for a little bit.
297000	301240	That's what the whole point is like, I don't actually train, I suck at everything.
301240	306280	But with the power of cheating, if you're a quantum battery, I'm able to do a bunch
306280	307280	of crazy stuff.
307280	309800	But yeah, it makes for a very entertaining montage.
309800	313020	So definitely check it out because it took forever to put that together.
313020	314880	All right, will do.
314880	320020	Okay, so I want to get into okay, so here's, here's the wild thing going on tonight.
320020	323820	There is so much breaking news happening today, like get out the duct tape, we have so much
323820	326000	breaking news that needs to be fixed.
326000	332160	So like, usually we do like one kickoff topic or one lead topic before we do our gaming
332160	333160	weeks.
333160	336280	I think we literally have five things to talk about for you to our gaming weeks tonight.
336280	340320	So but that's fine, because there's a little less gaming news overall this week, because
340320	341740	it all dropped today.
341740	344400	So we're gonna, we're gonna get into it here in a moment here.
344400	347720	I do want to say one more time, though, for the audience this week.
347720	349840	Please excuse our voices.
349840	351720	Dark soccer mentioned she's sick.
351720	354440	I hosted a show here live last night, which was great.
354440	358040	I know some of you know that I on the side do some live theater and variety show hosting.
358040	362420	We had a huge show last night, but it also kind of affected my voice.
362420	364840	So Loki on the other hand is just good.
364840	366560	But but yeah, I can feel it.
366560	367560	I have allergies.
367560	370160	So I'm fine.
370160	371160	For the most part.
371160	372320	We're all old and broken.
372320	374240	So please just bear with us.
374240	377380	Yeah, Dan was in the same state as me.
377380	381760	And I mean, I think we might have both had like a cold but typically when I get a cold
381760	384320	it evolves into a sinus infection.
384320	388520	And if they don't catch it quick for me, I get bronchitis really easily.
388520	393240	So I'm on the hardcore antibiotics right now, which has the plus side of giving me good
393240	394800	skin for like a month.
394800	395800	All right.
395800	398540	Well, let's talk a little bit about our trip to TwitchCon.
398540	404720	So because we do have so much other news to talk about, I would drive Yeah, I don't want
404720	408720	to talk about like every single streamer we met because that's that's too much.
408720	413920	But how about maybe like, overall, let's start here overall.
413920	417080	What were your thoughts on TwitchCon?
417080	420340	And what were like your top three things from TwitchCon?
420340	429560	So overall in top three, fucking big, but I'd say because I didn't get to go to really
429560	434580	any of the panels because of shenanigans, I'll put it that way.
434580	437500	Because I could have gone to a panel, but I was planning for something else.
437500	440260	And then that got swept out from under me.
440260	448980	So I I'd say my top things are seeing all the charities represented.
449620	454100	Lots of networking opportunities to that was really great.
454100	459140	And then just getting to put faces, well, I mean, all of them, I already saw faces,
459140	466740	getting to put physical bodies, flesh, getting to put flesh face to the flesh.
466740	471060	But but like just getting to see all these people I've made friends with and getting
471060	476700	to see people I've already met again, you know, like like Nick and a few people.
476740	485740	Just getting to see people, to meet my friends, you know, who have, you know,
485740	491460	spent the last year getting to know and seeing just how real a lot of them are online.
491460	495380	You know, just about everybody was how I expected them to be.
495380	502100	Few people were quieter than I expected them to be, but most everybody was pretty genuine.
502100	507140	You know, it was very, very crowded, though.
507140	517740	I mean, it's a it's already a big place, but like I think they're.
517740	521500	I got a little bit late, got in a little bit late because I like sleep,
521500	524460	and that made it easier for me to get through the prescreening.
524460	529660	I like the idea of having the bands, but I think they could have had some sort
529660	535020	of different deployment system for it.
535020	538300	They were giving away those extra swag bags at the end of the con.
538300	540100	By the way, I got like two more of them.
540100	544820	It was funny for those that aren't aware, the wristbands were like the covid screening check,
544820	549980	like either you had a negative test or you were vaccinated.
549980	553300	But yeah, like they gave you these bands and like they didn't.
553300	556700	You had to wear it basically for three days straight like you.
556700	558580	So I just kept the thing on for three days.
558580	562020	I felt gross, like it felt like I was wearing a life alert or something.
562020	563380	It wasn't that gross.
563380	566540	I mean, seriously, it was easy to clean off.
566540	567900	You know, it was plastic.
567900	569220	It felt weird.
569220	571060	I've done it before for other cons.
571060	573140	It's not that big of a deal for me.
573140	579420	It was. But I certainly enjoyed cosplaying, but there weren't a lot of other cosplayers.
579420	581740	There was a few big ones like the Big Daddy.
581740	583820	Did you see? I did. Yeah.
583820	587580	And a reptar.
587580	595140	That was like an inflatable costume, you know, the artist room was really great,
595140	600540	except I don't know, it was I don't mind a lot of original stuff,
600540	605060	but I was seeing like some of the same fandoms represented over and over,
605060	607620	not necessarily the things that I wanted to see.
607620	613420	And then, of course, there was like the the pervy booths, which I'm not into.
613420	619500	I mean, there. I also just an overhearing because I mean,
619500	625860	I'll I'll predominantly the folks I hung out with were were gay and non-binary people.
625860	631100	And there was not enough eye candy for for the gay men.
631100	636540	I'm just going to say or the women who were into male bodies, I guess.
636540	642260	You know, it was very heavily marketed to the straight male gaze,
642260	644940	which is disgusting.
644940	649500	But there was a lot of like funny stuff, a lot of cute art represented,
649500	656420	a lot of really good, serious artists like the the the person that did the oil paintings of the scenes.
656420	658460	Did you go by that? I did. Yeah.
658460	664140	I talked to the there's a person who did hand thrown ceramics live on stream.
664140	669060	And I'm going to be putting in a commissioned order soon for my swear jar,
669060	674140	which is the more I swear, you know, the more money I have to put in there because swearing is awesome.
674140	678940	And that'll get me rich quick. But he was he's he's from Tennessee.
678940	682100	We chatted about, you know, Waffle House for a little bit.
682100	687660	And and they're a D&D person. They're like, yeah, we've got the fifth edition.
687660	694020	So I was like, I play second. And I got this look of.
694020	703860	You must like pain, like, no, I like calculators and sheets and having an actual use for, you know, a D4.
703860	712340	But or D3, but. Overall, people were mostly pleasant.
712340	717700	Got to actually the drag show. Oh, my fucking God, it was great.
717700	726260	And London was London Bradshaw. To do something that geared toward.
726260	729500	Mental health. Yeah, I loved it.
729500	735060	I love the representation of very impressive friends. I love London anyway.
735060	742700	And Marisol had a wonderful Marisol Awards. I felt sorry for poor deer because.
742700	746980	I don't know, it's like a first time presenting and I know how nerve nerve wracking that can be.
746980	749580	And with a crowd like that. Yeah.
749580	754340	A hosting in front of your computer is not quite the same as hosting in front of a live crowd.
754340	757700	And I'm not saying that in a shady way. I'm just saying it.
757700	761020	Yeah. Yeah. Under the circumstances, it was amazing.
761020	767060	Yeah. Everything you would expect there. It's just I think some things just it's it's hard to jump in.
767060	772140	You know, and I'm talking as somebody who does do live hosting in front of lots of people last night.
772140	777780	And it's one of those things was like that. I didn't I didn't just my first 20 times on stage were not beautiful.
777780	781300	You know, it's just you have to grow into that. It takes it takes practice like anything else.
781300	784700	Right. So it's probably hard to jump into that at TwitchCon for the first time.
784700	790860	My thing is forget there's people. Yeah, I mean, you've seen me do panels.
790860	798980	I'm kind of the same way with everything that I do. But I also I mean, I have I've done performances and solos and ensembles.
798980	807100	So I had that to bolster me for those things. But but I mean, over overall.
807100	812260	And we're going to address some of the worst parts of the con.
812260	817300	And I saw that shit coming, but I'm going to leave that be for a moment.
817300	823620	Like when we first walked by that particular thing that we're going to address, I said, oh, that's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
823620	828340	And then I wanted to kind of do it because I love American gladiators.
828380	833220	But I digress. I did network with a lot of people, different companies.
833220	838740	I got to play the new PSO2, which is OK.
838740	841820	They're like, so how long have you been playing Phantasy Star?
841820	850380	I'm like, since the Japanese beta of Phantasy Star online, the old one on Dreamcast.
850380	862060	Oh. That was funny, like and I'm sorry, just on a purely petty, selfish.
862060	868740	What's what I'm thinking of? I guess kind of like tooting my own heart thing.
868740	875140	My skincare routine is completely paid off because nobody believed my age.
875140	880580	I felt especially the person who asked me if I was 26.
880580	888540	Thank you. Yeah, off by 20 years, we were definitely some of the old we were definitely some of the older people at TwitchCon, but not the oldest.
888540	894180	I saw some other folks there that were clearly older than we were and props to them.
894180	898380	I hope I still have the drive to do that stuff when I'm in my 50s and 60s.
898380	903740	I did meet up with the folks from Mix It Up Bot and they they're awesome.
904620	915300	We talked a bit about Mac support and talk about Stadia going down and how moving to Boosteroid for things and just talk about more Mac integration for some of those things.
915300	918300	And I've offered to beta test a few things.
918300	924540	Met up with the guy who created Blerp, which is what I use for sound redeems on my channel now.
924540	934540	And it's just got to meet like a lot of creators who do behind the scenes stuff as much as the people in front of the camera.
934540	938260	And people don't understand when you start streaming.
938260	945340	I mean, you don't need a lot to start. You basically need either a computer or a phone or a console.
945340	951460	A lot of consoles have now. Yeah, I talk to people who do phone streaming, stream their games from their phones.
951460	954140	I have the apps for it. I just haven't bothered.
954140	958580	But people who do, they're just chatting streams all directly through their phones or their iPad.
958580	965300	And you don't need a lot. You don't need a lot of money to start.
965300	970900	It's free applications. You remember how shitty my first webcam was.
970900	979420	But I mean, for me, I've done 90 percent of my graphics, video editing and music on my channel.
979420	982820	It's a lot of work. Imagine having to pay somebody for that.
982820	990100	But these apps that mix it up, they don't make anything off of it. It's free and it's really good.
990100	996460	Not like using some of the extreme labs where they charge you a premium for shit you can get for free online.
996460	1006060	So kudos to them. The stream, what is it, the stream Raiders people had like a stream pirates thing.
1006060	1010740	It was kind of cool. Oh, that's that's their new thing, their new game that they're showing off.
1010740	1022580	But I just liked meeting more of the people who do stuff to support streamers and they have a thankless job mostly.
1022580	1032420	And y'all are the lifeblood of a successful streamer. And kudos to all of you who do this stuff from behind the scenes.
1032420	1036780	Transitioning from that into some of my thoughts on the show floor and stuff,
1036780	1042700	I thought like, you know, as far as what I got out of the show floor and some of the exhibits and so forth,
1042700	1046580	I actually found I had a very similar experience to the very first time I went to TwitchCon.
1046580	1052780	Because remember, our voiceover guy, Jason, invited me on a whim the first year and I went to TwitchCon for a day.
1052780	1055860	And I wasn't very immersed in Twitch culture. I knew about it.
1055860	1061740	But I learned a lot about like streaming and some of the like behind the scenes stuff is very informative.
1061740	1066180	That that first year I went, I would say from that perspective, I got a similar thing.
1066180	1071340	I think there were a lot of things on the show floor that were meh, like, you know, like the the foam pit,
1071340	1076340	which yes, we'll talk more about in a minute, like just some silly stuff, like the giant games were kind of fun.
1076340	1079580	The giant Wendy's booth, which you know, okay, cool.
1079580	1084060	Wendy's is a sponsor and they were given away grape frosty is this like a limited time thing?
1084060	1084460	Ew.
1084460	1087420	I mean, but I'm diabetic. I can't have them anyway.
1087420	1091020	The Capital One thing there too, but Twitch has a partnership with them.
1091020	1094740	But I get it. They're all sponsors and they're paying for it. So they get a little space.
1094740	1099900	There was the Velveeta booth and that was great. They had a ball pit with Velveeta.
1099900	1103020	Yeah. So so little packets of Velveeta shells and cheese.
1103020	1108020	You know, and there were a few game companies like Sega was there, obviously, with the fantasy star
1108020	1113180	and they were showing off the like a dragon, like reboot of the Dreamcast game and all that.
1113180	1121580	And then they like Street Fighter six definitely had a presence there because there's no, I watched others play, but I didn't want to wait.
1121580	1125900	Honestly, playing on a hand controller was kind of crappy.
1125900	1133940	I gave up after one match because it hurt playing on the the the eight button controller, though, that was fun.
1133940	1136860	Yeah. And the new girl, Kimberly, is great. Let's hope that later.
1136860	1142660	So so so like my top things, I would say I loved the drag show.
1142660	1146700	You know, obviously, Dark Soccer and I have our drag spinoff talks and so forth.
1146700	1160660	But I was I was just so happy that they spotlighted that type of queer content literally front and center right after the opening ceremony of the opening keynote, which I I'm not going to say the opening keynote was a letdown.
1160660	1162580	I thought the charity donations were nice.
1162580	1166300	I thought, you know, there was a lot of like, OK, yay, Twitch type of stuff built into it.
1166460	1169580	But I was very surprised how little wows there were in it.
1169580	1174660	And I'm I'm really shocked at how Amazon clearly seems to operate as a siloed company.
1174900	1178300	And I this is something that if I ran Amazon, I don't.
1178980	1185340	But if I ran Amazon, I would really be trying to break down some of these silos because Amazon feels like an incredibly siloed company to me.
1185540	1191460	And you see that when Twitch talks about being charged by their own company for bandwidth and how much that whole thing costs.
1192100	1203620	And I think this opening keynote, like what a missed opportunity to showcase Amazon Luna or anything relating to Prime Gaming or anything related to, you know, other types of nerd content.
1203660	1213500	Like, I was just shocked at how much Amazon fails to utilize things that might be relevant and exciting to their captive audience that paid to be there.
1214340	1218860	So I think it's a big fail on not Twitch's part, Amazon's part.
1219500	1222420	And that's that's Amazon operating in silos.
1222420	1228220	And I think they're going to regret not taking advantage of that type of stuff sooner, to be quite honest, in my opinion.
1229460	1231620	But back to the drag show, the good news.
1231740	1239140	I was so happy that they spotlighted something like that front and center because I loved the Twitch kind of like put their metaphorical weight behind that.
1239260	1251540	And the importance that something like Twitch was to the drag community who remember lost bars and clubs for at least a year, if not longer, which is a big income source for many of these folks.
1251780	1256220	And I also kind of love the fact that the drag people they were showcasing.
1256460	1265180	And this is this is absolutely no shade to the fabulous queens that are on this platform as a result of larger exposure on a show like Drag Race.
1265340	1270940	I love Ongina, Detox, very talented Trixie Mattel even streams on here once in a while.
1270940	1272860	These are all fantastic people.
1273140	1276700	However, I love that none of them were involved in the drag show.
1276860	1282300	And the focus was really on people that really made their headway on Twitch.
1282420	1287340	You could argue that Bitch Puddin kind of because she was the winner of Dragula season two.
1287620	1302100	But I do think Bitch Puddin sort of has that card of hey, I threw that weight from winning Dragula behind putting on these digital shows and using my name and my resources to bring everyone else exposure.
1302100	1305780	And for that reason, she absolutely deserved a seat at that table.
1305780	1307740	And I thought she did a great job hosting.
1308460	1311860	Yeah, and I do think that she was a fantastic choice of a host.
1311860	1314580	Yes, you need that big name as a host.
1314620	1315820	No notes, no notes.
1315820	1316620	I'm yeah.
1316780	1319540	And I love that they showcased queens.
1319660	1321340	I think there were two kings.
1321380	1323820	There's non binary individual in there as well.
1323820	1325420	I love that kind of ran the gamut.
1325580	1328820	I loved you know, some of the performances were so so good.
1329020	1333860	Rose Evergreen, Alan Vanmotor, like was like that was amazing.
1334140	1337580	And that does and if you haven't seen it, it's all on the video on demand.
1337580	1339180	And just, it was just fun.
1339180	1341980	And it was fun to be in the room and feel that energy and so forth.
1342100	1357820	And like you said, London Bradshaw, I thought their approach to the whole thing and really, really utilizing AV, all the other performers did things that were elevated like club and like RuPaul worked the world types of things on a big stage.
1357980	1360260	Again, nothing wrong with that.
1360260	1361540	It was fantastic.
1361700	1381220	What London did, incorporating the AV intelligently and intentionally into their act, and giving a shout out to so many other people through that method and tying that all into the overarching thing about what the pandemic did to our mental health and how Twitch was able to tie into that.
1381420	1386220	I mean, gold star tens, tens, tens across the board.
1386220	1387700	I don't know what the fuck you else to say.
1387900	1390500	Like, that was incredible.
1390500	1392140	And I'm so happy with what they did.
1392820	1394500	And really, everybody, everybody did great.
1394660	1400660	Well, and on top of that, as just as a streamer, London is hilarious.
1400660	1404580	I mean, doing a lot more GTA roleplay stuff lately.
1404580	1404940	Yeah.
1404940	1408580	But just absolutely wonderful to watch.
1408580	1412380	And back when they were doing DBD, that was also a lot of fun.
1413900	1415580	Let's see if I'm looking at a top three.
1415580	1419180	So that would definitely be like, one of my top number to have like top 11.
1419180	1421940	I know one of my other top would be Well, here's the thing.
1421940	1431100	And here's in general, what I like about TwitchCon is that I like the element of, hey, let's all agree, we're going to be in the same place at the same time.
1431460	1435820	And let's be real, you didn't need Twitch necessarily to do that.
1436020	1439740	I'm sure we all well, sorry, let me backtrack.
1439980	1443820	Twitch, yes, was instrumental in us all meeting each other.
1444300	1447140	But we didn't necessarily need them to put on the party.
1447140	1453060	And we knew we know so many people that went and didn't really go to TwitchCon.
1453060	1457380	They were just like, gonna be in San Diego and hang out with folks that weekend or what have you.
1457380	1459580	Still pissed about missing the Kim Petras concert.
1459940	1460580	Oh, yeah.
1460580	1461980	I mean, it's whatever.
1461980	1464300	It's, you know, I think that was-
1464300	1467340	A spaghetti factory, although I understand, but still are.
1467460	1468500	I, yeah.
1468500	1471100	Anyway, it was Cheesecake Factory, not spaghetti factory.
1472380	1473420	90 minute wait.
1473460	1474420	We were quoted 60.
1474420	1478340	But anyway, I'm not I'm not going to go full Chad on this program.
1478740	1479980	So it is what it is.
1479980	1480380	They were short staff.
1480380	1481780	We already had a Karen there anyway.
1481780	1482140	Yeah.
1483340	1483900	Let's see.
1483900	1488020	I also really enjoyed the panels that I did go to.
1489180	1490700	I'm sad about the one I missed.
1490700	1492020	They're well, they're all online.
1492020	1493580	You can go watch them all on demand.
1493580	1494060	And I thought-
1494060	1498500	The tax one was, I thought, really a good one to have.
1498980	1500940	Some of them could have done better.
1500980	1504540	Again, just because you're great on Twitch doesn't mean you're great
1504540	1507580	in front of a crowd and you have to prepare for a panel in a certain way.
1507900	1512340	I went to a panel that I felt was two really good panels
1512340	1516260	smushed into one panel where the two panels kind of attacked each other
1516260	1519780	and no message stood out as a result.
1520020	1523580	So there were things, there's definitely room for improvement in that regard.
1523740	1525580	But there were some good panels that I went to.
1525580	1527940	Actually, I thought the one that was the most fascinating was the one
1527940	1531700	that Twitch staff put on themselves about how to get recognized
1531700	1536820	on the Twitch platform and, you know, what kind of goes into getting discovered.
1536820	1538740	And there was a lot that I like kind of knew.
1538740	1541660	But one big takeaway I got from that panel was
1542420	1547420	schedule your streams best you can, which is something I don't like doing
1547420	1550820	because I don't like kind of committing in that regard
1550820	1553060	because I don't want Twitch to be my third job.
1553420	1555380	I want Twitch to be a fun thing in the side.
1555380	1556860	But my God-
1556860	1558740	And I started from the get go.
1558740	1561780	Twitch is leaning into those so much.
1561780	1565060	And like, for an example, for those of you that are watching live on Twitch
1565060	1568580	right now, like there's this new shout out feature that you can use.
1568580	1570980	So you can shout out another streamer.
1571180	1573580	So if I were to actually do a shout out here
1574260	1576380	and I'm going to do that in the chat so you can see this,
1577260	1579980	it'll actually show
1579980	1583860	that here's here they are and here's the follow button to follow them.
1584020	1586020	Now, I don't think Bobby had any stream schedule.
1586020	1587020	I shouted out Bobby.
1587020	1590380	So I don't think he has any streams actually scheduled that are coming up.
1590380	1592900	But if he does, you would see it right there below.
1592900	1595860	So you can like bookmark it and know it's coming up and so forth.
1595860	1599620	So it's it's like that is now the new like native shout out feature
1599620	1600180	that's built in.
1600180	1601940	So you don't have to use Nightbot or anything like that.
1601940	1605060	But like they're also showing schedules of people you follow,
1605060	1606580	like on the front page.
1606580	1609300	That's something they're going to be adding and so on and so on.
1609460	1613420	So I just I you know, again, I don't love the idea of scheduling everything,
1613420	1614820	but I'm going to try
1614820	1617060	because I think this is a really important thing to be leveraging.
1618420	1620220	So that was something I got out of a panel.
1620220	1622340	And then I guess that's three things.
1622340	1624020	That was, you know, the people, the panel.
1624020	1627140	So here's here's here's the thing.
1627980	1631740	Would I pay the two hundred dollars to go to TwitchCon again?
1632820	1634060	I'm not sure.
1634060	1637060	I'm not sure I needed to be there all three days.
1637460	1640940	And maybe part of that is because I use the trip as an excuse
1640940	1643500	to see my muggle friends who have nothing to do at Twitch.
1644140	1648140	You know, as like my one of my closest friends who used to be my roommate
1648380	1651500	back when this show was in the garage studio, when we were on Justin TV.
1651740	1654140	My roommate from that era lives in San Diego now.
1654340	1657740	So we met up in Hillcrest for brunch one day and had nothing to do at TwitchCon.
1657740	1659660	And I enjoyed doing things like that, too.
1659660	1662460	And so I kind of feel like, you know what I would like.
1662460	1665100	And I think back to the year I went with Jason
1665500	1667780	and I was like, I got a lot out of one day.
1667940	1670500	I got a lot out of just walking the show floor and doing the one day.
1670700	1674340	So I feel like next year, maybe I'll do all three days.
1674940	1678460	But like, I would get a lot out of just going for one day
1678860	1682380	and doing as many panels as I can and making sure I pick the day
1682380	1686780	that the drag showcase is also on is the day I would want to attend the convention.
1688180	1690700	But yeah, I'm doing all three again.
1692100	1695660	As far as meeting people, I was also kind of surprised
1695660	1697860	like how quickly I met people.
1698100	1701700	And like, there's just this nature of people.
1702300	1704540	This is a big lesson I learned, a big lesson I learned.
1705220	1708780	There is a nature for people, even when meeting in person,
1709100	1711300	to hang out within their clicks.
1711300	1713260	And I'm not using that in a negative way.
1713260	1715540	I completely understand.
1715540	1717100	People are introverted.
1717100	1719420	People are extroverted introverts and so forth.
1719420	1721060	It takes a lot.
1721060	1723180	Not everybody can reach out to somebody
1723180	1726020	the same way they can online when they're necessarily in person.
1726060	1730060	And people gravitate towards hanging within their clicks in person.
1730300	1734180	So I sort of felt like for that reason, I wasn't really mingling
1734380	1737820	with people that I've kind of lurked in their streams for a long time.
1738340	1740260	And that was a big lesson to me.
1740260	1742700	I need to stop lurking in streams.
1742700	1746740	That set me back when it came to really meeting and talking to people
1746940	1751380	and like being able to chat with people like wholeheartedly at TwitchCon,
1751380	1754900	because and a lot of this is because, you know, I own it
1755180	1758980	for a long time before I lived in this place and I lived at the old house.
1758980	1763060	It was easy for me to watch Twitch on the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One,
1763180	1765020	where it's very difficult to chat.
1765020	1766420	You don't chat with a controller.
1766420	1769620	Yes, I can get out my phone and chat that way, but that's a pain in the butt.
1769620	1770780	I don't want to do that.
1770780	1774340	So I need to make sure that I lurk less
1774540	1778340	and talk more, even if it's hi, lol, nice play
1778340	1782740	or the number one thing that streamers love making clips.
1782980	1784540	Make a clip of a good moment.
1784540	1786620	Streamers will remember you for that. That's for sure.
1786900	1791220	So that's that's kind of a big thing I took away for me is that
1791460	1794860	I need to make sure I'm participating in Twitch and not just lurking,
1794860	1798580	because then when it comes to stuff like this, like people don't have a lot
1798580	1799500	to talk about.
1799500	1802500	And it's you know, it's just something I just kind of notice.
1802900	1805260	And I think that's one thing where I feel like Twitch might be able
1805260	1808300	to improve a con the next year and make it a little more attractive.
1808580	1811060	Even though yes, Dark Soccer, I understand like the networking.
1811060	1814140	I think you use networking in a way of like meeting and mingling
1814140	1815180	with the people that you you know,
1815180	1818740	because you you've done that immersion in Twitch culture in a way I did it.
1818740	1821540	And I will fully, fully, you know, say that up front.
1822700	1825340	I think where Twitch could have done better
1825700	1829980	is create more intentional places to network with new people.
1830260	1834540	And I thought one place to do that would have been the LGBTQ meetup
1834540	1836140	the first day.
1836500	1839140	It was just a room full of clicks.
1839140	1841420	Again, I'm not using that in a negative context.
1841420	1844300	I understand people want to meet their viewers and their peoples
1844300	1846020	and the people they raid all the time for the first time.
1846020	1849700	How much better would an event have been that was designed
1849700	1854380	to intentionally meet and greet new LGBTQ streamers
1854380	1857100	you haven't worked with before or whatever?
1857100	1860780	You know, that's that's the content for me, for you out there listening.
1860780	1863900	If you're not a part of the LGBT community, what if that is like,
1863900	1865660	you know, Latin streamers?
1865660	1869220	I know how to meet up Asian-American Pacific Islander streamers
1869220	1870900	had their own meet up.
1870940	1873060	San Diego locals had their own meet up.
1873060	1875300	There is a group that you fit into somewhere in there.
1875300	1878380	And I think if those have been more intentionally networking events
1878580	1882660	and like somebody could have been on a microphone and been like, OK,
1882780	1884980	pick a card when you go into the room.
1884980	1886140	Now go to a table.
1886140	1888420	All of the diamonds over here, all of the hearts over here.
1888620	1890940	Tell us, give us the elevator pitch about your stream.
1890940	1892420	OK, now we're going to mix it up.
1892420	1893580	All the aces go over here.
1893580	1895340	All the twos go over here. All the threes go over here.
1895340	1898060	Tell us about a video game you really enjoy streaming and why.
1898260	1901780	And like have those prompt topics to like really get people talking and mingling.
1902420	1907540	How much better would that have been to really meet and grow your network?
1908060	1911060	And that's why it's like Twitch speed dating.
1911060	1914380	But, you know, without the dating, it is maybe that's what they needed.
1914500	1916940	Sort of mentorship program.
1916940	1920020	I think they did have that, but it was so popular
1920020	1922860	and in a small room and not a spotlight in the con.
1922860	1925340	I doubt people knew it was there, to be honest.
1925940	1931820	I am. So, oh, pod culture sounds like a cool way to mix.
1931820	1937180	Look, Twitch, I humbly nominate myself to run some of your networking panels next year
1937180	1941180	because not to give away the job of what I do for a living,
1941180	1945900	but like this sort of how to meet new people on the first day at a new job, let's say
1947180	1949020	is something I'm very well versed in.
1949020	1952980	So anyway, I just I think that's the opportunity.
1953100	1956060	Twitch Con is great for networking with the people you already know.
1956060	1958620	Twitch Con today is not great for networking with people you don't.
1959380	1962060	I think that you should reach out to them and offer.
1962060	1964220	I really do. I'll do that.
1964420	1966180	I will. Bobby, clip it.
1966180	1967020	Hold me accountable.
1968460	1969860	I'll be on your ass for it.
1969860	1970740	I think it's a great idea.
1970740	1972180	No, I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
1972180	1975620	All right. So let's talk about we've been alluding to it.
1975660	1978140	Let's talk about that thing that did make the news.
1978140	1980340	So I'm sure you've heard.
1980340	1987300	But in case you haven't, Twitch Con, Lenovo, they're all in a bit of hot water
1987300	1991340	because there was a booth that they had set up that resulted in some major injuries.
1991900	1993540	They had an American gladiator.
1993540	1997580	If you remember the game Joust from American Gladiators, where people stand up on pedestals
1997580	2002180	and kind of knock themselves around with big foam sticks, they had this thing set up.
2002180	2004540	It was almost like shield style.
2004740	2009540	Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, all right, this was set up and then there was a big foam pit
2009540	2011780	that you would fall into, you know, you get knocked down.
2011780	2013300	But here's the thing.
2013300	2017780	That foam pit, I mean, for that type of fall looked a little bit shallow.
2018540	2021980	I'm not sure a bunch of foam cubes are really going to break the fall
2021980	2025140	the way a foam mat would.
2025140	2030700	It's actually very deceptive because they use cubes like that for jumping.
2031540	2033860	Actually, I'll use something that you've seen Drag Race.
2034460	2037300	Sure. And they use a deep foam pit to catch people.
2037300	2042700	They do it sometimes for for larger falling stunts because it's a more
2043420	2044740	what's the word I'm thinking of?
2046220	2049460	It'll conform a little bit more to the shape of a body.
2049740	2054020	Right. However, it was deceptive.
2054020	2057580	If you go by it and how elevated it looked like it was,
2058100	2062020	it seemed like it was deeper than it was.
2062020	2065740	But even so, I was saying that that's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
2065740	2067980	People are going to hurt themselves.
2067980	2071220	Someone's going to punch someone in the face with that thing
2071220	2073700	and break their glasses into their eyeball or something.
2073700	2076820	I'm I'm thinking of Carrie, too.
2076860	2079460	But anyway, the way they're supposed to be set up is they're supposed to be
2079460	2083460	at least like four to six feet deep with the foam cubes and have like
2083900	2087460	almost like a trampoline on the bottom, like some sort of thing that has give.
2087780	2090300	Whereas this looked like it was about two feet.
2091220	2094980	Maybe it was and solid concrete in the bottom.
2095460	2097660	Now, granted.
2097660	2100380	I would say that, especially for
2101460	2103900	Adriana, the girl who broke her back.
2103900	2106700	Yeah, I was I was going to get to that, but we don't want to tangent.
2106700	2109540	So let me just say a notable streamer, Adriana Czeclik,
2110060	2112380	suffered a back injury on Sunday.
2112500	2114460	And it was, you know, the videos everywhere.
2114460	2117580	And, you know, I did a full on cheerleader jump off that thing.
2117580	2118460	Yeah, she did.
2118460	2122660	But, you know, she thought it was safe to, you know, a safe landing there. Right.
2122940	2124780	So but she wasn't the only one that hurt herself.
2124780	2127340	So if you think, you know, she was silly for jumping off,
2127980	2129820	she really wasn't the only one that hurt herself.
2129820	2133380	Locke Van Ness sent a tweet with a picture of her in a wheelchair
2133740	2137060	recovering from an injury that she sustained and so on and so on.
2137060	2140300	In a statement, there were other people.
2140300	2143340	Yeah. In a statement, Twitch said, We are aware of the incidence of Twitch
2143340	2146460	com visitors who sustained injuries in the gladiator game soft foam pit
2146460	2147700	at the Lenovo booth.
2147700	2150140	The area has since been closed for any further use
2150140	2152620	while we work with event organizers to look into the incidents.
2152940	2154900	Well, that's probably a long time.
2154900	2156700	They probably should have done that after the first incident.
2156700	2158700	But it is what it is, I guess.
2158700	2160140	That's that's what they said.
2160140	2165900	And I don't think the waivers are going to do either company a lick of good.
2166340	2168820	No, it's negligence.
2168820	2171900	They didn't follow proper procedure.
2173940	2177060	I mean, granted, and this is just the side note.
2177260	2178860	I don't think I would have done a full on
2178860	2182060	cheerleader jump into this ambiguous pile of foam.
2182540	2186060	Mm hmm. But at the same time,
2186780	2190140	I'll admit it look deceptively deep. Yeah.
2191500	2193580	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says waivers don't matter
2193580	2195140	when there's negligence in building the thing.
2195140	2197580	And yeah, I think that's what it's really going to come down to, to be honest.
2198380	2199860	Now, the other side.
2199860	2202740	This is also why, by the way, conventions have to carry insurance.
2203060	2206340	So I mean, here's the at the end of the day, people are like,
2206340	2208300	is Twitch going to go bankrupt because of these lawsuits?
2208700	2211860	They're insured trust in that whole thing.
2211860	2216620	However, it TwitchCon premiums, TwitchCon ticket prices
2216620	2218780	will go up next year to cover the new insurance premiums.
2218820	2220580	That's where this goes.
2221020	2223900	Well, but at any rate, though, you saw the Wendy's side, right,
2223900	2225940	where they had just like the long half tube,
2226700	2232620	and it gave more surface area and it was a more on the level.
2232620	2234740	They weren't well elevated above it.
2234740	2239020	It would have been just like, you know, stumbling on a path if someone fell.
2239940	2242980	That one, I think, was better handled.
2242980	2246700	And I don't think a lot of people got really injured off of the Wendy's one.
2247060	2251380	Yeah, because it I mean, there was some people really going at each other,
2251980	2256660	but it was a lot more to code, I think.
2256940	2258260	I'm just going to break it down.
2258260	2260820	I think those types of physical challenge things are corny
2260820	2263420	and not needed on the TwitchCon for in the first place.
2263420	2265460	Maybe I'm just the wrong audience. I'm too old.
2265460	2267020	You know, OK, boomer or whatever.
2267020	2268260	Heard on the balloon game.
2268260	2271340	I just I think that type of stuff just is a waste of space,
2271340	2272980	to be quite honest, on the TwitchCon floor.
2272980	2276020	It's also very negligent anyways, because like imagine like
2276020	2280260	so we had her jump in into the pit, but like.
2281220	2285540	People are known to dive into those things like someone could have died
2285540	2287660	in that thing. Yeah. So
2288980	2290860	well, we'll see what develops, because I mean,
2290860	2292340	there's certainly going to be a lawsuit.
2292340	2293300	There hasn't been one yet.
2293300	2296420	And I don't know who's if she, Adriana does it or what.
2296460	2297740	They all do it a class action.
2297740	2298620	I don't know. They're there.
2298620	2299820	There will be lawsuits.
2299820	2301740	There will be and there will be settlements as a result.
2301740	2304140	And we will never find out the details because that is how these things
2304140	2306180	always go. Yeah. Count on it.
2306780	2309300	Breaking your back like that is a lifelong injury.
2309300	2310860	She's going to be dealing with that forever.
2310860	2313860	She already says she has nerve damage done to her bladder because of it.
2314580	2316940	They have to fuse bones
2318700	2321060	in. She's undergone several surgeries already.
2321060	2323580	Like it's horrible. That's ridiculous. Yeah.
2324900	2325980	All right. Well,
2326020	2328820	I hope she is able to recover as much as possible
2328820	2331140	in the coming days and weeks and so forth.
2331140	2332460	And that's really unfortunate.
2332460	2336020	And one one of the others was about this balloon game.
2336020	2338180	And I'm sure we've all played it, you know, with our friends.
2338180	2341220	We just try to keep the balloon in the air.
2342060	2344180	But there were other people who got injured with that
2344180	2347300	because there were obstacles in the room in the form of furniture.
2347940	2352580	And I saw people just diving over shit to try to get that.
2352580	2356780	And it just it just wasn't great.
2357460	2359940	S.H.A. 100 Matt says, I mean, they couldn't do a dunk
2359940	2362540	your favorite streamer in the dunk tank for charity.
2363020	2366100	Sure, sure. Put it in the Wendy's booth and dunk them in a great frosty.
2366100	2366940	No, I'm kidding.
2366940	2371220	That would not be good.
2371220	2373380	That would not be good here.
2373380	2376340	Look, for example, the stream Raiders people, Captain TV,
2376540	2381620	they had a makeshift like Plinko game that was clearly put together
2381620	2386220	in someone's spare time to give away T-shirts that I fully endorse.
2386220	2388100	That's that's how you do it.
2388100	2391180	A cheesy little Price is Right rip off game.
2391460	2392580	Nobody's going to be.
2392580	2396460	That is how you do something to get people over in your booth.
2396860	2398420	Or they guess that sound effect,
2398420	2400780	the way they played a game I really never played.
2401780	2404500	Sound effect, but oh, that was the blurb.
2404780	2408020	That was the blurb booth.
2408020	2408940	I didn't see that.
2408940	2411500	You had to guess three sound effects and you got to spin a wheel.
2411940	2414700	And they started off with Skyrim, of which I've played once.
2416980	2421500	But but I I that was how I got in touch with the creator
2421500	2424220	and we ended up chatting for a good minute.
2424420	2426260	There was a booth that had a makeshift press
2426260	2428460	your luck game that got my attention instantly.
2428460	2430740	But now and I'm going to be honest and sorry to those,
2431100	2432780	I couldn't tell you who they were.
2432780	2436340	I knew they said they were promoting something that was like a OBS,
2436340	2438540	but better because it had built in games and stuff.
2438740	2442460	But the demo they showed me like did not show me any of the built in games.
2442460	2444660	They had me play a makeshift press your luck.
2444940	2447500	And then it was like whatever squares I would land on would be things
2447500	2449780	they would show me, like make your own GIF and things like this.
2449780	2454420	And I was like, I thought I was excited because I was like,
2454420	2456980	oh, I would love to do like a vog game night with press
2456980	2459060	your luck and video game trivia, like tell me more.
2459060	2462020	And that's not the impression I got from that booth at all.
2462300	2465380	So maybe I maybe I read it wrong.
2465380	2466100	I need to look into it.
2466100	2469100	I didn't even see that, nor did I see the Plinko.
2469340	2470780	I mean, it's just it was way in the corner.
2470780	2473340	It was tucked away in the congested things were.
2473340	2478340	And I'm also sad, though, that I mean, they're just
2479580	2482180	I think that the traffic could have also been better
2482580	2485900	routed and that they needed more exits on the.
2486140	2488500	I mean, they opened them up later, but the first day they didn't.
2489260	2493740	The the way they routed traffic in the building was ridiculous, too.
2493780	2498100	Like you had to walk all the way down, loop around, come back.
2498100	2500100	Like it was just all all this extra walking.
2500100	2502780	There was another escalator and an open elevator.
2503020	2506060	Oh, my gosh. But it was all the way on the ballroom side.
2506140	2509500	I can't believe San Diego Comic-Con is at that same convention center.
2509500	2512380	Like now that I've been there, I'm like, how did they do Comic-Con here?
2512700	2514300	This I felt like that place was too.
2514300	2516100	I mean, granted, they probably weren't using it all.
2516100	2517340	But I know they weren't using it all.
2517340	2520020	But it's like this place felt small to me.
2520020	2522660	But for something like that. But anyway, I digress.
2522780	2524940	We have a lot of other news to get into.
2524940	2527940	So if you want to hear more about TwitchCon, I know Dark Soccer
2527940	2529260	has talked about it on her stream.
2529260	2532140	I've talked about it on my stream. And of course, I barely have.
2533140	2537740	We'll, you know, talk about whatever you want and gossip more later in the week.
2538220	2542020	For now, though, we have a lot of breaking news, as I mentioned before.
2543460	2547700	Just a couple hours ago, a pretty big one that just a pretty big,
2547700	2551380	big bombshell that just landed variety deadline.
2551420	2555140	These are, you know, newspapers and traditional magazines
2555140	2558300	that report on things that are going on in the TV and film industry.
2558300	2559980	They're pretty renowned in Hollywood.
2559980	2563820	And they've announced that G4 is shutting down.
2564620	2566940	Now, there's no end date.
2566940	2570100	There's no there's not going to be a nice send off this time.
2570100	2572980	Like there was the first time G4 is done effective immediately.
2573620	2576900	Forty five staff members of G4 TV unfortunately lost their jobs.
2577580	2580820	And some of them found out because this letter that apparently
2580820	2585860	Comcast spectator chairman and CEO Dave Scott cited
2585860	2589620	or distributed, not everybody had received yet,
2590460	2593660	which just goes to show the incompetence of management once again,
2593860	2596140	ruining something that was a nice thing for some people.
2596300	2599820	And from the get go, this whole fucking thing was confusing.
2600100	2602820	Like and I've said this before, and I know I know G4 had it says,
2602820	2605340	I'm not knocking the programming.
2605820	2609540	I'm knocking the way it was managed by Comcast. Once again.
2610220	2612980	Why the fuck wasn't it a dedicated network on Peacock?
2613380	2616740	Like, how siloed is the company running?
2616740	2618500	Or did they even have it streaming available?
2618500	2619540	That was the thing. It was weird.
2619540	2621420	It was like this is only on cable.
2621420	2624060	But it wasn't actual G4 on Pluto.
2624060	2628260	It was like a selections of G4 on like it didn't make sense.
2628780	2632500	Like and then it was like you had some stuff on YouTube or Twitch.
2632620	2635900	It was like like because we have we know we have to compete with that crowd.
2636060	2638620	But we also want to be a traditional cable network.
2638740	2641020	What the fuck are you G4?
2641980	2644100	It was a problem from the beginning. I'm sorry.
2644100	2646540	I know the network had fans. I know people that work there.
2646540	2648420	I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be a bitch.
2648620	2653460	It's just it was mismanaged from the beginning.
2653780	2655900	And it's and this is this.
2655940	2658220	This is the sad end to it all.
2658340	2659860	And I'm sorry to the fans.
2660020	2667620	But this should also be a warning for all cable traditional networks as far as I'm concerned.
2668180	2672380	Because this is just accelerated because G4 is related to tech.
2672780	2674340	But you know where the eyes are going.
2674780	2676220	The eyes are going online.
2676380	2677860	The eyes are going to YouTube.
2678020	2680020	The eyes are going to the streaming services.
2680180	2683100	Traditional cable does not have much time left.
2683100	2691860	And as I've said so many times before on this show, the more widespread 5G gets, more and more people are going to cut the cord with cable.
2691860	2693380	I don't have traditional cable anymore.
2693820	2695500	I've made that no secret on this show.
2695900	2697980	Something I haven't talked about a lot on this show.
2697980	2698900	I'm going to bring this up.
2699500	2708900	When I was young, long time ago, old man Roberts, seven when I was 16, 17, 18 years old, I had a public access television show.
2709860	2712100	Does anyone know what a public access show is today?
2713700	2714580	15 Wayne's World.
2714580	2717780	You all do because you were also 15, 16 when I was.
2718140	2721580	But very few people even know what a public access show is these days.
2721620	2722180	Why?
2722220	2723340	Go watch Wayne's World.
2723420	2724300	Yeah, Wayne's World.
2724540	2727100	Although Wayne's World wasn't exactly what we were doing.
2727100	2731660	But and I also understand public access still exists in some very large markets.
2731820	2739540	But you have to understand public access is as niche of a thing as artists releasing their albums on cassette tapes in the year 2022.
2739700	2741860	That's the kind of niche thing public access is.
2743060	2746780	People are doing it again, but the same way they're doing vinyl and it is very niche.
2746780	2747780	But it's a niche, right?
2747780	2748860	It's hilarious.
2748860	2755500	So but that's the thing is that public access doesn't exist anymore.
2755500	2759020	For the most part, 99% doesn't exist anymore.
2759060	2759620	Why?
2760060	2762180	Because it all went to YouTube.
2762700	2767900	You do everything online or Twitch or one of the other video on demand competitors that's out there.
2768020	2776220	Like the novelty of having your own show on television and learning how to edit tapes, you know, do editing a tape that that's all gone.
2776220	2779340	You have computer programs that are very easily available to do all of that now.
2779340	2781060	You don't need to use fancy equipment anymore.
2781580	2782260	That is true.
2782260	2783300	It's all free, too.
2783660	2785500	Some of it is that Lightroom is.
2785820	2787180	Yeah, there's there's a bunch that do that.
2787940	2788540	Da Vinci.
2788820	2790140	Yeah, Resolve is a good one.
2791700	2794260	Anybody that has an Apple device already has iMovie.
2794420	2800620	You know, there's that VXJ6V in chat says Tom Green started to show on public access before fame.
2800620	2803660	Yeah, there was another one that moved to MTV.
2804580	2809300	That was actually a lot of their like 90s content shifted over from public access.
2809300	2811660	I want to say Siffle and Ollie was a public access thing, too.
2811660	2812380	I may be wrong.
2812660	2813900	It sure felt like one, though.
2815540	2818660	Zen Monkey 11 says it wasn't mismanaged just ahead of its time.
2818660	2819660	They had a good thing going.
2819660	2820700	It will be back soon.
2820980	2823060	I'm sorry, as I know you were a fan.
2823060	2824820	I'm going to agree to disagree with you on this.
2824820	2825820	It was mismanaged.
2826340	2829340	And if you want to see my proof.
2830980	2831900	Go read the article.
2832820	2834540	This news is the proof.
2834580	2835580	It was mismanaged.
2835700	2837260	And I'm sorry, I know you are a fan.
2837260	2838980	And that's a hard thing to say.
2838980	2848460	And I'm not going to many of those people, especially the ones that are full time Twitch streamers, pro wrestlers in the industry somewhere else, they will absolutely bounce back do their own thing.
2848580	2852140	There's going to be plenty of content in that same vein that you will be able to watch.
2852220	2856180	But Comcast could not wrangle that into a traditional television channel.
2856180	2860180	And my proof is what we just talked about.
2861100	2866900	So let's see other in chat.
2867100	2870540	Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says this shutdown was especially mismanaged.
2870660	2874660	Everyone got fired at three thirty on a Sunday, and most of them learned about it through Twitter articles.
2874660	2876340	That's the height of mismanagement.
2876340	2876980	Thank you.
2877100	2883100	That is thank you for putting that succinctly as a tangible example of yes, there was mismanagement going on.
2883700	2886060	And so that's that's that's what it is.
2886900	2890500	But again, I think a lot of those talented people will bounce right back.
2890620	2899820	And probably what are what are most people doing when their shows and so forth on traditional cable get canceled?
2899820	2900460	What do they do?
2900620	2901820	They go start a podcast.
2902180	2903980	They start a YouTube and file for unemployment.
2904020	2909340	They start a or they spin off something on to like a streaming service or something like that.
2909340	2927180	Or are they I mean, these are very talented individuals that should be able to do something outside of, you know, cable TV or how you have people like Leo Laporte, who they're still doing this week in tech, just, you know, not on tech TV.
2927180	2929620	They're on their own network that they've made example.
2929940	2930220	Yeah.
2930500	2934700	And that's that's where many of these talented folks are ultimately going to end up.
2934700	2941220	And I encourage those of you that were fans of G4, please support them wherever they go and wherever they end up.
2941660	2942740	That's the best thing you can do.
2944180	2946540	All right, um, continued breaking news tonight.
2947140	2949340	Earlier, actually, it's a few hours old at this point.
2949340	2951300	But Loki, why don't you break this one down?
2951300	2953860	What we have an announcement of announcement, right?
2954460	2972420	Konami dusted off their Twitter account to basically let us know that the latest updates for the Silent Hill series will be revealed during the Silent Hill transmission on Wednesday, October 19th at 2pm Pacific Standard Time or Daylight Time.
2972940	2984260	Um, I'm expecting disappointment because of Konami, but I will check it out just to see what it is.
2984260	2987900	But like, my expectations can't be lower.
2988420	2994660	Yeah, I've been saying for a while now it's time for Konami to shit or get off the pot when it comes to Silent Hill.
2994660	2999860	So I'm really glad we're going to get an information dump on October 19th.
3000260	3004460	But, you know, we'll I have my expectations are also very low.
3005300	3007980	But I would love to be proven wrong.
3007980	3013100	I think the best thing that can happen in this scenario is Konami teaming up with the right partners.
3013620	3021780	For example, there's that long standing rumor that they've partnered up with the Bloober team, the ones that did the medium that to do like a new Silent Hill two vision or what have you.
3022340	3026380	Now, I know people have their opinions when it comes to that studio and the medium and so forth.
3026380	3033700	But I think those types of partnerships and putting the established IP in the hands of people that can actually do things with it, I think is the right way to go.
3033740	3038060	So I think in my opinion, that would be the best possible thing that comes out of this news.
3038060	3039300	So we'll see.
3039300	3043820	I yeah, and I'm with Darktitsvia in chat, I'll reserve judgment till I see what it is.
3044140	3048580	And big same, you know, I'm willing to give them the benefit of going into it with an open mind.
3049260	3052020	Tigerklonchat says it'll be a Silent Hill casino game.
3052100	3054220	If you get three pyramid heads, you win the jackpot.
3054340	3061340	Yeah, obviously, there's casino and pachico jokes aplenty online with this and rightfully so Konami has earned every one of those jokes.
3061500	3070340	However, just yeah, this this is this is going to be something I would say worst case scenario is a mobile game.
3070740	3071660	But there's going to
3074180	3075180	that's or you're wrong.
3075180	3076900	They could get much worse than that.
3076900	3082420	I honestly truly don't think it will be I do think Konami with this hype and so forth.
3082420	3084300	This is not about pachinko or casino.
3084580	3086660	This is about a game.
3086900	3088180	It could be a mobile game.
3088380	3091860	But I, you know, again, whether smoke there's fire, right?
3091860	3093940	And we've heard the rumors of a reboot.
3093940	3106780	We've heard the rumors of, you know, going back and revisiting Silent Hill 2, especially when you consider Silent Hill 2 has been propped up into the year 2022 2021 through Dead by Daylight and other revivals of the IP.
3106780	3108580	Through merchandising and so forth.
3109340	3110140	Three and two.
3110140	3110820	Three and two.
3110820	3111700	Yes, you're right, of course.
3111700	3113180	Because, yeah, with with Cheryl.
3113180	3114260	Because of Heather Cheryl.
3114300	3114620	Yeah.
3114820	3121580	So but but my point still stands, you know, is that like Silent Hill is still kind of, you know, been bolstered up and so forth.
3121580	3124020	And so there's there's a reason to revisit those older games.
3124260	3125380	So let's let's see.
3125380	3128940	I do think there is going to be an actual game.
3130500	3131100	And we'll see.
3131100	3133180	I hope they put it in the right hands, you know.
3133180	3146660	Yeah, but but like the last Metal Gear game, the last Contra game that they've made, the Silent Hill remake that they did a remaster.
3146660	3149500	I know the remaster track record is not good.
3149500	3157260	And what's the the soccer games that they have that allegedly one of the rumors was that that team is working on this.
3158060	3160740	Yike, I just like there's like, that's true.
3160740	3161300	Forget it.
3161620	3162260	Forget it.
3162940	3164580	I can't imagine a good outcome.
3164580	3168060	Loki, the thing all those things have in common, they've all been developed internally.
3168420	3172420	And that's why I have reservations about the sweet code and HD remix, to be quite honest.
3173260	3177500	I would say that looks better than anything else so far.
3177500	3179380	So maybe some lessons have been learned.
3179380	3180100	I don't know.
3180100	3183780	Maybe they're not working off of broken code like the Silent Hill 3 one was.
3184140	3186980	But I'm sorry, my hesitations are completely justified.
3187220	3188420	So let's see.
3188420	3189220	Prove me wrong.
3189380	3191900	I, I would love nothing more than to be wrong.
3192500	3193700	Yeah, I would love to be wrong.
3193700	3194020	Please.
3194020	3194500	Love to be wrong.
3194500	3195540	Please let me be wrong.
3196020	3196340	Yeah.
3198420	3202940	TigerClawnChat says Konami saw how successful the TMNT Kawabunga collection was.
3202940	3205060	What if it was some type of Silent Hill collection?
3205580	3207140	They already tried that, remember?
3207340	3213260	And they couldn't because they didn't want to go into the voice actor agreements from two and three.
3213460	3215780	They redid with all new voice actors.
3215780	3217940	And it wasn't the voice acting alone.
3217940	3221220	But the two and three redos that when they did revisit that were terrible.
3221740	3226460	Well, the fact that they were missing the game code, the finished game code for three.
3226780	3227860	Yeah, so.
3227860	3236340	So they had to work off of an earlier build and we could it still had a lot of the glitches that had been fixed for the final release.
3236380	3241780	Yeah, I but but yeah, if that's where they're going to go is that somebody is going to rebuild Silent Hill from scratch.
3241780	3243380	Hell, all four of the original games.
3243780	3244940	Justice for the room.
3244940	3246140	I hope it was good.
3246140	3249740	I hope they go about it like the way that Resident Evil has been like.
3249740	3250860	Yeah, that's a good.
3250860	3252180	That's a great way to do that.
3252180	3255180	Let's do that with Silent Hill would be fantastic.
3255180	3256820	Yeah, I would be all about that.
3256820	3257580	Absolutely.
3257580	3258220	Absolutely.
3258540	3258940	All right.
3259140	3268580	Well, I brought up voice actors for a reason, because the actual kickoff story tonight that we had slotted before all this breaking news was something that has taken social media by storm.
3268900	3274140	I have a lot to say on this, but Loki is I'm going to let you cover the facts of this scenario.
3274140	3275740	And then I'm just a warning.
3275780	3277540	I have a lot to say, Loki.
3277540	3296100	So Helena Taylor had come out, I believe it was on Twitter and posted a few videos on Twitter talking about how she wasn't doing the voice for Bayonetta three, and that she wanted folks to boycott the game.
3296100	3306300	The reason for that is because the final offer that Platinum Games gave her for her performance for the whole game was $4,000.
3306700	3313500	Mind you, this is a company that's made hundreds of millions of dollars off of the franchise so far.
3314940	3319100	The going rate for voice acting anyways is about 1000.
3319100	3333420	I think David Hayter came out and said something about what was it like $1,000 per hour, you know, is kind of like the bare minimum like going rate for like the voice acting of that caliber or something like that.
3333700	3339700	So there's no way to be able to record the entire dialogue for a whole game in four hours or four sessions.
3341100	3346260	So it's basically it was a way to kind of force her out because they couldn't fire her.
3346980	3355180	So instead, they're offering her a salary that she's obviously not going to take in basically forcing her to quit.
3355420	3364620	And then of course, now they're getting Jennifer Hale to come in to do the voice acting and you can't tell me that she's cheaper than $4,000.
3364940	3369660	She's not. It's I don't know what the reasoning was with pushing her out.
3369660	3385020	But basically that it's kind of interesting to like with Jennifer Hale, because I think she also like was a big proponent of like the voice actors, like a union and everything and kind of pushing for that.
3385020	3393780	So like this kind of hear about what's going on and someone being pushed out and then someone else coming in to just, oh, do the role like that's a little weird.
3396780	3397620	Yeah, yeah.
3398860	3401140	So here's the thing.
3401740	3409180	There's a lot of talk on Twitter about this $4,000 and paying Helena what she's worth and you know, all of this.
3409940	3412900	And I do I do agree with a lot of that.
3413140	3423820	You know, Helena, you know, as the voice actors, her Bayonetta deserves a sum of money that is representative of this character that she's been asked to come back and portray for the third time.
3424020	3425660	So that part I do agree with.
3426340	3430420	And so there's that you as I was watching the videos, here's the thing.
3430620	3440740	I think a lot of people talking about this on social media haven't bothered to watch the videos, her videos and hear the words out of her mouth directly because there was a lot in it that kind of surprised me.
3441380	3444860	And here's where I have an opinion that I think differs from the norm.
3445820	3447100	And I'm willing to stand by it.
3447100	3459580	I have been unfollowed on Twitter already because of this opinion, because people are so tied to these headlines that they believe in and I truly believe have lost the ability somewhere along the way to critically think.
3460340	3461300	But it is what it is.
3461300	3464940	I can't force engagement on any platform and best of luck to you.
3464940	3468740	And I hope things in your tunnel vision, la la land go wonderfully.
3469740	3474460	My viewpoint is that Helena Taylor is lying by omission in these videos, and I'm going to tell you why.
3475620	3482340	In the first and second video, as I watch them, she's explaining the process that she went through.
3482340	3486860	She had to audition again for the role because it's been a few years.
3486860	3490460	You have to make sure the voice level is still there and so forth, which all makes sense.
3491020	3500780	She talks about appealing to Kamaya to get more money, and she was offered this insultingly low $4,000, which can't even pay for certain things and so forth.
3500780	3505620	And in those first two videos, I am completely like with her and I'm like, yeah, that's shitty.
3505620	3506380	What the fuck?
3506380	3513860	Like, yeah, she's earned certainly a much larger paycheck than, you know, if $4,000 is the base, she really deserves much more than that.
3513980	3528740	I mean, granted, I know that voice actors and actresses can supplement income quite greatly with the convention circuit and signing autographs and making appearances and doing all of that.
3528740	3531580	However, she shouldn't have to rely on that.
3531580	3533900	She should be able to get a decent paycheck.
3535300	3536700	Then the third video happens.
3536700	3549060	In the third video, she talks about her replacement, and she says, and about the new girl, hold on.
3550620	3557620	Surely she knows at this point because it is well documented that her replacement is Jennifer fucking Hale.
3557620	3568020	The new girl, that was a patronizing comment towards her replacement, who is a veteran and a respected person in this industry.
3568020	3582660	And that was the first thing that made me raise my eyebrow going, wait a minute, I thought the voice actor circle of actors and actresses was very tight knit, and that she, you know, they all know each other and they all get along and they all support each other and it's like a big family, right?
3582660	3588220	I also noticed that Helena Taylor hasn't done a lot of convention appearances.
3588220	3590260	She appeared at a convention in Phoenix.
3590260	3595100	I noticed other voice actors and actresses in Bayonetta have shown up, even some of them here locally.
3596420	3599260	That struck me as a curiosity.
3599940	3600460	That's all.
3600460	3615260	Then she goes on to say, in a very backhanded compliment, while I wish her the best of luck, she has no right to sign things as Bayonetta, or do things as the character that I've created.
3618260	3622620	Jennifer Hale doesn't need to sign things as Bayonetta.
3622620	3627420	Jennifer Hale has a resume that goes far beyond Bayonetta.
3630220	3634420	You, Helena Taylor, may need that supplemental income.
3635420	3636620	Jennifer Hale does not.
3637420	3640620	You're threatened by Jennifer Hale coming in and taking this role.
3640620	3642020	That's what I got from this video.
3642620	3648020	And then the proverbial cherry on top of the sundate is the fourth video.
3648420	3653420	She starts telling a tale from the Bible about Lazarus.
3654420	3658220	She's comparing her situation to a story out of the Bible.
3658820	3666220	But if you go in and you look at Helena Taylor's like tweets, it should be no surprise that she's quite religiously influenced.
3666220	3670820	She likes tweets from homophobic pastors like Joel Osteen in her history.
3673420	3674420	Here's the thing.
3675420	3686420	Again, I was with her on those first two videos, but when she started shading Jennifer Hale, and that's what that third video was, I said, no, there's more to this story than this.
3686420	3695420	And I'm going back to something Loki said here about the whole, you know, they purposely offered her a lowball figure to get her out the door.
3696420	3706420	And that's this, this, you know, again, I don't know why if they just wanted her out the door, why didn't they just flunk her audition, they could have done that.
3706420	3712420	There is talk out there and I don't, I don't know if this is true, this may be considered spoilery.
3712420	3720420	There is talk out there that the Bayonetta character was supposed to be killed in the beginning of Bayonetta 3 and replaced with like an alternate Bayonetta.
3720420	3733420	So like this whole game was designed, so it is potential, if that ends up being the plot, that she was only offered so much money to do the role because Bayonetta as we know her is only in the game for a few minutes.
3733420	3744420	And if that's the case, does $4,000 seem like such an ugly sum, or is matching the sum you were paid for a prior game actually kind of a nice thing to do?
3744420	3748420	Now again, until we know the plot of the game, we don't know if any of that is true.
3748420	3762420	However, going back to the third video, Helena Taylor had no problem breaking her NDA, shading Jennifer Taylor, and casually saying, if there is a spinoff game that comes out with Jean, you shouldn't support it.
3762420	3765420	So just casually mentioning that there's a spinoff game.
3765420	3775420	Helena, why is Platinum Games trying to keep developing games without you? Is it possible you are difficult to work with?
3775420	3785420	And again, I don't know Helena Taylor. Perhaps she's a nice person. I'm a little put off by some of the things she said in her fourth video and some of the tweets she likes, but you know what, I'm willing to have an open mind.
3785420	3791420	But is there the possibility that Helena Taylor is difficult to work with?
3791420	3811420	So why are we all rushing to her side without even considering there is another element to the story? Because the other thing, a person like that knows how to milk sympathy for what they want.
3811420	3822420	It's called being a Karen. And I'm sorry, especially in that fourth video, I saw some, I was getting BKE from Helena Taylor.
3822420	3833420	They're also, it's like you were saying a minute ago, there are other factors to consider and people are very bandwagon-y.
3833420	3842420	They see people that they respect jumping to conclusions and they jump to the conclusions as well.
3843420	3859420	And it's just how people are. People are followers. And what we need to do is people need to stop learning. People need to stop being followers and start being thinkers.
3859420	3862420	Yes. 100% this.
3863420	3875420	Start looking, I'm going to use an analogy, okay? I've been on this 70s movie's kick and I just watched Logan's run again. I don't know if you know how that movie ends.
3875420	3889420	Well, here's a 40-year spoiler. They're trapped in this world where everyone has to die at 30. And so these two people get out, they learn there's an outside world and that you can keep living and they come back.
3889420	3902420	And the thing that the computer system had them go out to learn, they keep refuting with real life thing and the computer breaks because the truth conflicts with its preconceived notions.
3902420	3914420	And I think that that's how people get. That once they have latched onto an idea, they're going to keep rolling with it no matter how wrong they are and not look for anything outside of their echo chamber.
3914420	3919420	They want to be right and they want to be angry.
3919420	3926420	They unfollowed me from Twitter because they didn't like what I had to say about maybe Helena Taylor is not the angel she paints herself to be in this situation.
3926420	3932420	I watched her videos and I was just disgusted within five seconds. I was like, I don't care. Jennifer Hill's a good voice actor.
3933420	3945420	It's kind of also like, though, we have a ton of stories about like corporations in the gaming sector doing things that are unfair to their employees.
3945420	3952420	So it is a very believable scenario that they may be trying to push her out because of some reasoning.
3952420	3962420	And that's why people don't necessarily look further into it because it's like, okay, yeah, this is like the fifth story this week that we've heard about companies screwing over their employees.
3962420	3966420	It's just very believable at this point.
3966420	3970420	And I want to make myself clear on something and I want to illustrate this with a comment from chat here.
3970420	3973420	So Mike Defton in our chat says, I've said it on Twitter and on Discord.
3973420	3978420	What we should take about this whole ordeal is voice actors get shafted a lot, fair treatment and pay to them.
3978420	3987420	I want to make sure I stress this. In those first two videos, I was with her and I said, yes, voice actors don't get paid enough.
3987420	3991420	Yes, the voice of Bayonetta should be paid more money for the success of the game.
3991420	3993420	Yes, yes, all of those things can be true.
3993420	4004420	Voice actors need to be respected, especially now that we're getting into this realm of like live capture and so forth and all the stuff I talked about, you know, after the Red Dead Redemption panel that I did to Dragon Con and so forth.
4004420	4007420	Yes, we need to make sure we're paying actors their fair work.
4007420	4024420	However, Helena Taylor lost me when she started shading Jennifer fucking Hale, who, by the way, Internet, before you, if you have called Jennifer Hale a scab in this whole thing, I need you to stop and look at your life and look at your choices and ask yourself if you know how to critically think.
4024420	4025420	Look at her record.
4025420	4027420	Look at her fucking record.
4027420	4034420	Jennifer Hale in 2016 was fighting for voice actor unionization rights.
4034420	4040420	I can't believe the fucking nerve of some of you people on Twitter, the way you're going after Jennifer Hale.
4040420	4044420	Do you think she fucking knew about any of this?
4044420	4047420	God, it's disgusting.
4047420	4055420	And here's the thing, I think that's the one person we would all love to hear from in this scenario is Jennifer Hale.
4055420	4063420	However, guess what? She doesn't need half or want to say a goddamn thing.
4063420	4067420	And every single one of us, including myself, needs to live with that.
4067420	4072420	Jennifer Hale does not owe a comment on this entire issue.
4072420	4080420	However, that all being said, Jennifer Hale is saying things in her own way.
4080420	4082420	She's liking some tweets.
4082420	4090420	She can't say things because of her NDA, but she can like some things, such as a tweet that read,
4090420	4094420	Helena understandably declined and then later Jennifer Hale was cast in the role.
4094420	4098420	I don't know how much Jennifer was paid, but I imagine it was likely more than what Helena was offered.
4098420	4101420	Why? That's up to platinum to answer, not Jennifer.
4101420	4102420	I agree with that.
4102420	4104420	Jennifer Hale definitely hasn't done anything wrong here.
4104420	4109420	After looking into the situation, it sounds like Helena was offered around the base SAG-AFTRA rate per session,
4109420	4113420	which is still insulting and a low ball for a returning main character in a game this popular.
4113420	4118420	Jennifer liked that tweet even after Helena shaded her, which I thought was a very nice thing to do.
4118420	4125420	Another tweet that Jennifer liked. I agree with this.
4125420	4132420	I loved Bayonetta's voice in the first two games, but boycotting is not the way to go since it disrespects Jennifer when she had nothing to do with this.
4132420	4137420	I definitely want voice actors to be paid better, but there are other ways to handle this. Yes.
4137420	4141420	And then look at this tweet that Jennifer liked. This is the one I really want to highlight.
4141420	4146420	I don't doubt this for one second, talking about Jennifer is a staunch advocate of VA rights.
4146420	4154420	The first part of Helena's tweets made perfect sense and I agree, but I think she was very unprofessional when talking about Jennifer.
4154420	4158420	What happened to her isn't Jennifer's fault.
4158420	4165420	And I think her like on that tweet says a lot of what I just said.
4168420	4174420	So all I'm going to say is it's very tempting to run with a headline sometimes.
4174420	4179420	And I've been guilty of this too. And this is a good reminder for me.
4179420	4184420	But this is why I stopped and said, you know what? These videos, they're only like five minutes. Let me watch.
4184420	4186420	I want to hear what she has to say about it.
4186420	4192420	There was that moment in that third video where I went, this doesn't add up.
4192420	4194420	Something's off.
4194420	4206420	The shade is unnecessary, spilling and breaking the NDA so fragrantly, basically daring platinum games to come after her is unnecessary.
4206420	4212420	Questbuster in our chat room says there's also the cultural context of platinum as a Japanese company.
4212420	4218420	They may have felt the offer allowed both to save face a big deal in countries like Japan, especially in business.
4218420	4223420	Perhaps they were obligated to offer her the role, but ultimately didn't want to or want her.
4223420	4224420	Yeah.
4224420	4225420	So.
4225420	4229420	Anyway, that that that makes perfect sense.
4229420	4232420	I mean, that is pretty standard.
4232420	4238420	I mean, not just in dealing with a role or something, but in dealing with people.
4239420	4242420	And that's when someone is expected to decline.
4242420	4245420	And that's to circle back. That's what I want to say.
4245420	4249420	When I said at the beginning, I believe Helena Taylor is lying by omission.
4249420	4258420	The part that she is admitting, either because she truly doesn't know it or I think she does, but she's leaving this part out is she's difficult to work with.
4258420	4269420	And I think, again, that fourth video and I think I think there's there in the way she shaded somebody in an industry that should be close.
4269420	4271420	I think there's a lot to say there.
4271420	4274420	I.
4274420	4276420	I have heard.
4276420	4282420	There have been some disappearing tweets from people, and I'm not talking about Kamiya.
4282420	4284420	I understand Kamiya on Twitter as a whole.
4284420	4286420	Look, I'm just I'm not going to go there.
4286420	4290420	I already said Platinum Games is not without their own issues in this whole thing.
4290420	4298420	I'm not forgiving them. I'm not saying they were in the right, but I am saying maybe there's something to this whole thing.
4298420	4305420	However, I have heard of some other deleted tweets from people who may be in the know.
4305420	4308420	There's more to this story that we don't know yet.
4308420	4313420	What what what are some of those tweets? Because I went to bed.
4314420	4329420	Basically, that just pouring a little gasoline on the fire of she's leaving stuff out, that there's there's more to the story that than she's leading on, that she's she knows what she's doing to stroke the sympathy lights and all this stuff.
4329420	4333420	This is this is a calculated move on her part.
4333420	4338420	Yeah, I think she's I think she's threatened by her appearances on the convention circuit.
4338420	4342420	I think that's what this all boils down to. I think she's threatened because she's not getting the convention bookings.
4342420	4347420	Jennifer Hale does. I think her I think I think that someone's jelly.
4347420	4351420	Yeah, I do. So we'll see. We'll see.
4351420	4357420	But I again, I you know, again, it's one of those things where it's like, if I'm an asshole, when we find this whole thing is said and done, then fine.
4357420	4362420	But I don't I again, I think the proof is in the way Helena said these things.
4362420	4365420	And I think what you see Jennifer Hale liking on Twitter.
4366420	4368420	He has a lot of insight as well.
4368420	4370420	So.
4370420	4371420	All right.
4371420	4374420	Let's see.
4374420	4376420	Other comments in chat.
4376420	4380420	DJ Ramesh does point out Helena is also UK based, so she won't get a lot of bookings here.
4380420	4383420	That is that is true. It's harder to bring somebody out from over there.
4383420	4390420	Let's see. A Zen Monkey 11 says difficult to work with. Don't you mean get paid less?
4390420	4392420	There is an interesting trend.
4392420	4394420	I'm sure you've heard of quiet quitting.
4394420	4398420	Look up a trend called quiet firing.
4398420	4403420	Because I think some of that is what you're talking about here.
4403420	4405420	So.
4405420	4412420	Bonds 006 says I view almost everything I see online regarding social media with calculated intent. Sure.
4412420	4420420	But is it why? Why couldn't she have done videos that said, hey, here's the reason I'm not coming back as Bayonetta.
4420420	4422420	I was only offered 4000 to play the role.
4422420	4426420	I feel after the first two games made this amount of money, I was entitled to more money.
4426420	4432420	And this is the you know, this is you know what this this wage 4000 is minimum wage.
4432420	4438420	And I felt what I brought to the character Bayonetta was minimum wage and ended it there.
4438420	4442420	I think she would have had she would have had my support.
4442420	4447420	But she didn't end it there. That's the problem.
4447420	4453420	All right. Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
4453420	4457420	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
4457420	4466420	A little eventful. I played, of course, Dead by Daylight, but I played offline because I couldn't stream with no voice.
4466420	4472420	I started Final Fantasy five last night again on a quiet stream this time.
4472420	4481420	And I had forgotten quite a bit about it. And I'm kind of glad for it because it makes the experience new and fresh for me again.
4481420	4494420	I played some pinball and I played like this phone runner cookie game at TwitchCon.
4494420	4501420	But I also played Street Fighter six and fuck it's good.
4501420	4506420	I mean, I'll admit I'm not great at it.
4506420	4514420	I actually played the controller, not the controller, but with the joystick one LC and I played.
4514420	4519420	And well, it kicked my butt because I was trying to figure out moves.
4519420	4525420	But my verdict is that Kimberly is a great addition to the roster.
4525420	4530420	She's sort of like what what Sakura is to Ryu.
4530420	4540420	Kimberly is to Gai, like the successor to the Bushin Ryu style.
4540420	4546420	And so she plays a lot like Gai, but with like this flair and this fun to it.
4546420	4554420	And and like she's got this extra color palette that's all like spray paint. Really, really good.
4554420	4562420	I played Chin Lee. She's Chin Lee. Boring. She's always fucking boring.
4562420	4570420	I played I played Ryu, which I mean, again, Ryu. But he was my first video game crush.
4570420	4576420	Ryu is my man. And oh, my God. Like, I think I put a picture up on my Twitter not long ago.
4576420	4583420	I'll have to find it. You can see the pores in his skin like it's that well done.
4583420	4592420	Of course, none of the women have pores. How dare we have pores. But but he's just rendered so beautiful.
4592420	4603420	I mean, the game is gorgeous. The control scheme, getting used to that new counter system.
4603420	4606420	It's all right. It wasn't really that bad with a dedicated button.
4607420	4622420	It's absolutely a game that you should have a at least a six button controller for or even an eight button so that you can map your your charging buttons and your your counters.
4622420	4630420	Learning the counters was kind of interesting. But overall, I mean, it's it's such a good game.
4630420	4637420	Oh, my God. I haven't been this excited about a Street Fighter game since Street Fighter four.
4637420	4642420	And and yeah, I know that that my girl's going to be in DLC probably at some point.
4642420	4649420	So another way to phrase that is you were not a fan of Street Fighter five because you just said it was your four and then six.
4649420	4655420	So just just just say it. Five five was not your D. Even numbers, y'all.
4655420	4660420	Those are good. But because honestly, I wasn't the biggest fan of Street Fighter three.
4660420	4664420	I seem to like like all the the even numbered ones in the Street Fighter series.
4664420	4669420	It's very Star Trek movies and still super pissed that.
4669420	4678420	Well. That was something of that they took the Street Fighter four soundtrack off of Apple Music.
4678420	4682420	Very sad about that. Very bitter. Had one of the best soundtracks.
4682420	4689420	What else did I play, though? I played my word game.
4689420	4697420	And I did because because we weren't here last week, I did beat Final Fantasy four.
4697420	4703420	But but yeah, that's about. Oh, and I played.
4703420	4712420	I played something else. Oh, I played some Bejeweled, believe it or not.
4712420	4716420	I actually had a lot of fun. It's been a while since I played it.
4716420	4729420	And you know me and my little puzzle droppy games. So also also I I've been spending a little bit more time with Boosteroid
4729420	4734420	and there's a chance I may be picking up Fortnite. Oh, wow.
4734420	4740420	Yeah, because it's not first person. I mean, I absolutely cannot run Overwatch two.
4740420	4746420	There's just no way I can do it. No way. I because it's not on any of the emulator,
4746420	4751420	you know, Windows things that won't run on Parallels on an M1 Mac.
4751420	4760420	And I really was looking kind of looking forward to playing it now that things have shifted a bit with company.
4760420	4767420	But yeah, there's also a vague chance I might be going back to Star Trek online. Oh, how random.
4767420	4775420	But that's fun. I kind of miss it. And I miss playing with because I was in a fleet with a bunch of Scotsman.
4775420	4779420	How cute. Because I was playing like at the weird times the morning.
4779420	4785420	Well, one of them is an English guy that lives in Edinburgh is an architect, decent friend.
4785420	4791420	And and I'd gotten in with with their fleet and we just kept playing.
4791420	4797420	I kind of miss it. But mostly what I miss is just being bored and hanging out on DS9.
4797420	4805420	So there's stuff going on in there. And oh, yeah, Cult of the Lamb, of course.
4805420	4813420	Which I've just been I'm getting ready to beat the game will not beat the game, but do the thing.
4813420	4817420	I do the thing. All right.
4817420	4821420	Loki, let's go to your hearing week.
4821420	4828420	Well, I mean, Minecraft. So I did want to talk about a little bit about what was in Minecraft Live.
4828420	4832420	So this was interesting this year.
4832420	4841420	Normally, the way it goes is they will announce the next update, kind of show off what the theme is and what they're doing and that type of stuff.
4841420	4849420	The problem is that in the last few years, they've fallen behind and really.
4849420	4855420	If I guess that not over promised, but they didn't deliver on what their promises were.
4855420	4863420	So, for example, going back to 117 Caves and Cliffs, they had to split that up in the two parts.
4863420	4869420	And I'm sure a lot of it has to do with COVID, obviously, and that delayed everything.
4869420	4878420	Plus the retooling of how chunks generate and adding that world height and the world depth to it.
4878420	4882420	It complicated things and redoing how all the caves and stuff were.
4882420	4885420	So it took them two updates to get that out.
4885420	4897420	And then the last update, which was 119, the wild update, they had promised like, oh, yeah, we're going to go back to all these biomes and kind of breathe new life into them and make them all feel diverse and do all this stuff.
4897420	4901420	And they showed the mangrove swamps, which get added to the game.
4901420	4908420	They showed off the deep dark, which was supposed to have been in caves and cliffs two updates ago.
4908420	4917420	And then they showed off concept art for these birch forests that they're supposed to update, but they did never get around to that.
4917420	4932420	So instead of delivering on their promises, they swung the pendulum the completely opposite direction and didn't reveal much of anything in this one.
4932420	4934420	They don't have a name for the update.
4934420	4946420	They didn't really see what their theme is for it, except some vague stuff on Twitter about inclusiveness and representation and and storytelling, which.
4946420	4952420	Like that could be just anything like it really that's not a direction.
4953420	4955420	We're getting camels, which is cool, I guess.
4955420	4956420	OK, cool.
4956420	4968420	Hanging signs, bamboo wood now has a new block type and bookshelves you can put books inside of.
4968420	4975420	That's kind of it, like it's all this random stuff that doesn't really fit together.
4975420	4984420	It's cool, some of it, but in the mob vote, we got this new mob called the Sniffer, which is like this prehistoric turtle dog looking thing.
4984420	4987420	It's kind of weird, but they did that.
4987420	4993420	But like, we don't know what they're bringing to the game, which is kind of frustrating.
4993420	4995420	And it's frustrating a lot of the community as well.
4995420	4998420	I understand like they don't want to disappoint people.
4998420	5005420	And it's cool that all this stuff that they are talking about arguing snapshots that are probably coming out in the next week or two.
5005420	5010420	But it would be nice to see, like, here's what we're trying to do.
5010420	5011420	Like, here's the theme that we have in mind.
5011420	5015420	But here's the stuff that we have done from this right now.
5015420	5017420	They're just not showing a lot.
5017420	5019420	So it's hard to get excited about things.
5019420	5020420	So that was just the main line stuff.
5020420	5025420	They showed off more Minecraft Legends footage, which I'm still kind of mixed on.
5025420	5028420	It looks all right, but like, I'm not like super excited to play that.
5028420	5031420	Not really much for dungeons either.
5031420	5034420	And then what else?
5034420	5039420	They had some weird thing about Minecraft Lego, but didn't really like show any new sets or anything.
5039420	5042420	It was just completely random nonsense that was in there.
5042420	5044420	It's just weird.
5044420	5045420	Just it felt weird.
5045420	5051420	But most of the week, aside from just the Minecraft stuff, it's been working on my episode.
5051420	5059420	So I got that out earlier this week, which it'd been I'm trying to get back to doing one a week type of thing.
5059420	5060420	We'll see.
5060420	5062420	But I'm trying to get back to that again.
5062420	5064420	All right.
5064420	5065420	Let's see my gaming week.
5065420	5071420	So I've played a little bit of a jumble of games, the usual stuff and playing Final Fantasy 14, of course.
5071420	5076420	Dead by Daylight has that cute little Halloween event in it, which is, you know, it's cute.
5076420	5079420	I'm hearing a lot of rumors about the new killer and survivor.
5079420	5084420	So I'm hoping we get to see those before too long because I'm super curious to see what they're going to add with that.
5084420	5092420	But then going back and revisiting old favorites, I got back on my No Man's Sky bullshit because the 4.0 update happened.
5092420	5095420	But I didn't even I never came out of nowhere.
5095420	5098420	A Twitch drops campaign started on Friday and I was like, what?
5098420	5105420	So I ended up doing a stream on Friday to help people get their drops for the game, especially with it coming out on Nintendo Switch.
5105420	5112420	Unfortunately, with the show yesterday that was taking up most of my day and then, of course, tonight's OLR, I haven't been able to stream this weekend.
5112420	5117420	But I'll do one more stream tomorrow on the last day of drops on Monday because there's some really good ones for Monday.
5117420	5124420	So I'll do a stream then and been exploring the and I keep joking and calling it the Bobby Black Wolf mode.
5125420	5136420	If you don't know the long running VoG network in joke, there was some problems and some controversy when the game Borderlands 2 came out because they had a character that had a BFF mode in it.
5136420	5152420	And it was long story short, it was interpreted as a long standing motif that female characters and women need help in video games, which as we all know, is not true because
5153420	5156420	women make up more than half the game press.
5156420	5168420	But when Bobby Black Wolf actually interviewed the developers on his show, he kind of asked the question about that whole thing and asked for their side of it and so forth.
5168420	5172420	And he said that they could rename BB mode or whatever it was to Bobby Black Wolf mode.
5172420	5176420	So now we call the easy mode in games Bobby Black Wolf mode because he plays games on easy mode.
5176420	5179420	So No Man's Sky added a Bobby Black Wolf mode to it.
5179420	5188420	We should not shame anybody. You know why we shouldn't be like, let's be honest, like I get home at the end of the day, and I may not necessarily want to be challenged in the game.
5188420	5197420	I just want to have fun. You know what, and that's and that's why they have difficulties because if your fun is you want to be challenged in something, you can choose to do that or you can choose not to do that.
5197420	5201420	It's however you want it, however you have your fun.
5201420	5214420	Yeah, that was it. Thank you, fifth dream. It was something like it was girlfriend mode was in one of the comments that was said not that set up the whole that was that was some years old controversy. Sorry, I'm a little rusty, but that's where the Bobby Black Wolf mode comment came from.
5214420	5226420	So anyway, I actually played the game a little bit on stream in in relaxed mode is what it's really called. And I actually I was really enjoying myself because yeah, sometimes you just want to play easy mode.
5226420	5240420	And it was actually really nice to have the base where it's like you don't have to make power for your base, you just automatically have power in your base. I don't have to worry about getting attacked by pirates. You know that it's different from creative mode because you're still going through the motions of actually playing the game.
5240420	5254420	But you don't like have to micromanage as much or and so to kind of take that out of it is actually it leads to some kind of fun things. I would still play the game on even hardcore once in a while just for the difficulty to do achievements and things like that.
5254420	5282420	But the game didn't lose anything for introducing relaxed mode. And I really think it's smart for them to have introduced custom mode, where you make your own fucking rules. If you want to do the survivability on planets, but eliminate pirates and space battles, you can do it that way. You can play this part of its relax this part of its normal, but I want permadeath. You can do that. And what I like about it is that all of those modes except for permadeath are mixed together.
5282420	5311420	So if you play permadeath, you're going to be in your own instance of the game when it comes to multiplayer. But otherwise, all the modes are mixed together. So you can play with your friends the way you want to play. And I think that's pretty rad. So kudos, I No Man's Sky is just the game that keeps on giving. It's great. I haven't played the switch version myself. It's $60. I don't know about charging that for a game that's been out for a while. But okay, like it is, it's hard to say the value isn't there after all the support over the years. So y'all make your own choices when it comes to how important is you to get that game.
5312420	5341420	portable and all that stuff. But um, yeah, I Yeah, if you haven't checked out No Man's Sky yet, make it a point to do so it's great. I played a little bit of speaking of like new stuff, new stuff. I played a little bit of Overwatch two, there was some launch hiccups and so forth. But I played a little bit with Alan, we played some and it's um, you know, it's it's similar to Overwatch one in a lot of ways, obviously, except they change the team comps, which kind of changed the nitty gritty of the game. And you know, the kind of the flow of the game.
5342420	5372380	of how fast people are dying, how it's more important than ever to really group up, you know, things of that. But for the most part, as far as there's that, like that experience of, you know, quick team combat. Yeah, I had a good time. You know, I like these games right now. I like these dead by daylights, these over watches. I'm kind of surprised I haven't gotten back into fortnight yet, but Alan just got super into it. So I'm probably do. But the thing I'm liking about these games right now. The palette resets every 20 minutes, because a new game start every everything starts over. And it's a new game.
5372420	5400260	game again. And that's kind of what I like about streaming, especially these games and watching streams of these games, because it's easy to just hop right in again. Right. So I think that part's pretty cool. Anyway, that's a little bit about my gaming week. So we have some more news to get into. So we're gonna kick it off with Loki getting into the news this week. Because, again, I know we just talked about like five things at the top of the show. But here's the actual like what happened during the week and not all like three hours before the show.
5400260	5427260	So this is going back to a story that we talked about a few weeks ago, about a contract worker that was terminated, allegedly, wrongfully, because they had questioned or asked about unions, I guess. So apparently, there has been a settlement that was reached with this individual for the amount of $25,910 with interest. And it's been a long time since we've had a contract worker that was terminated, allegedly, wrongfully, because they had questioned or asked about unions, I guess.
5430260	5450260	And it's supposed to be paid to through Aston Carter, which is the hiring agency that Nintendo uses. But of course, it has to be, I think, agreed upon with there's one other group that had to make the agreement with that. But it sounds like that this is going to be concluding with that settlement.
5450260	5459260	So I guess they're not good. Maybe there's smoke where there is fire there since, you know, maybe they had a case. That's why they're paying them out.
5459260	5483260	So it's very clear that, you know, Nintendo's got problems of their own. And that's not even the things we were talking about earlier in the show. Like this is just like, when it comes to their employees, they unfortunately, and it goes back to what we said from the very beginning when it started with Activision Blizzard, this is an industry wide problem. And there's a lot of people in the industry that need to be held accountable.
5483260	5501260	So now, granted, what's happening with Nintendo, there's there are some differences here, but with the union busting and so forth, like, that's not cool. Obviously, we know that. And so it's nice to see that, you know, the, the the laws on the workers side in this case. So, you know, you can be a fan of Nintendo and still say what they're doing here. Not cool. Not cool.
5501260	5529260	All right, before we get into our next story, I have some more breaking news. And it ties to something we were just talking about. Dark Sakura, did you know this? You just wrote a tweet. I support Jennifer Hale. She is an advocate of voice actor rights and Helena was ridiculously unprofessional in her videos, and she broke NDA. Jennifer is innocent in this. Look at facts and learn to think critically. Five likes.
5529260	5552260	Really? One of them, Jennifer Hale. Oh, shit. In the last 20 minutes. I didn't look. Oh, that's nice. I love her. Hmm. She's such a sweetie. Hmm. And that makes me happy. Hmm. Moving on. Yeah. Hey, I'm part of the drama now.
5552260	5567260	No, you don't want to be Twitter's main character tomorrow. But, um, no, but I'm, I'm doing a screenshot. Huh? And I've met her. She's so nice. She likes my Grey Warden costume.
5567260	5591260	She's obviously bound by an NDA. And she can't say things, but she can still say a lot. And I'm telling them just again, like, we all have been watching this industry for a very long time. And there's just sometimes there's a certain way the tea leaves flow together. Anyway. All right, moving on. Let's talk about Street Five as if we can.
5591260	5615260	Move on. Let's talk about Street Fighter six. I just I just moved the darn title of the stream clicking around too much. All right. No. Street Fighter six has some pretty cool accessibility features that are built into it. And this is, you know, one of those things where it's like, oh, cool, you know, Street Fighter five didn't necessarily bring all this, but it really seems like Street Fighter six is bringing a lot to this, too.
5615260	5640260	the table. They're bringing up some sound accessibility to help visually impaired players. By the way, this is all coming out of the beta because the beta recently happened for the game or might still be going on. I'm not sure I wasn't in it. But I know a lot of this information is because of the beta that's underway right now. But you can actually get spoken signals in the game for the menu system and select screens, and then customizable sound options during the fight. So you can actually get spoken signals in the game.
5640260	5670220	the menu system and select screens, and then customizable sound options during the fight. So you can actually get sound for like distance, whether a strike actually connected or was blocked, drive gauge when it gains up or it burns when a player does a jump attack alternate sounds if you cross the opponent. So that's pretty cool. You can also use a slider system to adjust the volume of every element of the fight. So maybe you don't want the music to be so loud or things like that. Yeah, that's all that's all things that you can change. So
5670220	5700140	that's really cool for accessibility and having some more of those visual cues have sound effects. So also, what's kind of cool, Street Fighter six is going to have customizable, a new challenger screen. So that's kind of cute. You know, when you put in remember back in Street Fighter two, you put in a new quarter and you hit the start button and it says says do do do do do do here comes a new challenger. Well, now you can actually customize these screens, you could have a different character in it. You can combine effects and
5700140	5729860	colors to kind of, you know, bring a little excitement to the online matches as you drop in and so forth. So I imagine a lot of these cosmetics are going to be things that you earn through in game credits. Maybe things you purchase. I don't know, we don't know yet. So I can't I can't really say that. But there is that. And of course, there is character creator mode in Street Fighter six. So finally, one of my favorite parts of Soul Calibur comes to Street Fighter six. There is that and of course, there are some very zany fighters that are showing up as a
5729860	5748580	result of that. So yeah, you can you can have different thickness and characters, hand size, abdomen bulge, different colors for everything. Muscle definition gets a three way slider. So you all know people are going wild in Street Fighter six.
5748580	5750300	I've seen some freakish things.
5750420	5779460	Yeah, so imagination. A lot of you have it out there in the gaming community. So yeah, so um, but I'm, I'm really excited to play Street Fighter six, that's for sure. So one of these days, I'll get around to it when the actual game comes out. Huh? All right. Moving on. Let's go to the next story. Look, sorry, I just I'm still reeling from that literal late breaking news about what we were just talking about and how it's it's like playing out in real time. Very interesting, isn't it? All right.
5779940	5781100	Moving on Loki.
5782100	5811060	So meta has revealed its brand new VR headset, the meta quest Pro, it's $1,500. And it's best, I guess, I'm trying to see what the the extra details are with it. I know that they're not necessarily targeting gamers for this, but more of they're looking at using this as a full on metaverse work tool, like almost like a PC that you would
5811060	5831380	work with. It's still too expensive. Um, but yeah, I think it has like the better tracking and of course, a more powerful processor in it or whatever. But I ain't paying $1,500 for a VR headset. I don't see how they're gonna sell this.
5831500	5858500	That is way too much money for a medium that hasn't broken through in the mainstream and quite the way it needs to to justify this kind of cost. I have it's growing has eye tracking expression tracking as well, which I guess will be used for more they said more expressive avatars. Maybe funded rent rendering or whatever with the eye tracking as well. But this I think it's too too expensive.
5858500	5887940	This is the Mercedes Benz of VR devices. And Bobby Blackwell points out they want to sell to businesses not casuals and businesses will pay. And I I understand I understand but I still think I'm not sure. You know, and even in my day work, I've seen like VR and how they want to integrate VR into that. And I understand like, let's say, let's say you want to teach somebody industrial like things and using a new factory thing in the factory.
5888500	5916780	But it's, you know, it's something you can't really learn in a book, but at the same time, it's dangerous equipment. And it's really hard to show somebody in real life. Like VR can kind of be a bridge to help teach somebody about those sorts of things. So I get that like a $1,500 device is definitely aimed at the business in that capacity. However, it's something that you said, Loki is something I'm not sure Bobby heard this about this story either. There's some story floating around there about meta.
5917780	5946740	That there was a business meeting about this type of device, and how how do we market this device to people, you know, and get people to pay it. And there was discussion about, well, people are getting their student loans forgiven. So now they'll have that extra money. And we need to market this device towards people that are getting student loans forgiven. And I'm like, now, granted, there's a lot of big grain of salt to take with that sort of story. Yeah. But at the same time, I kind of look at a company like meta and can I
5946740	5956340	go? Can I see Zuckerberg saying something ridiculous like that? Can I see rich people completely out of touch with the rest of the world? Yes.
5956340	5985340	If you're hell bent on like, if you think that, like, you need to spend 1500 for gaming and VR, I implore you to probably consider the PlayStation VR two and the PlayStation five if you want to go that route, and you probably still would have like $500 to spare on top of that. And you're probably gonna get a better experience altogether. Because like I'm telling you right now, if you spend $1,500 on that to go into the metaverse, which no one is using, by the way,
5986980	5989340	or at least a horizon worlds thing. I
5989940	5991020	that it's Yeah,
5991620	6005340	you horizon worlds and that whole I'm sorry, you're talking about the horizon zero dawn spin off on PlayStation, right? No, no, no, no, the horizon worlds as in the VR, like 3d chat. I don't even think that is that meta has
6005340	6009180	Oh, that's what that's called. I thought that was just called metaverse that
6009180	6021420	whole No, no, no meta metaverse is a thing that's like calling the internet like it. They want to go well metaverse that's us because we named ourselves meta and it's still so clever. It's stupid. But like,
6021420	6051140	just I'm sorry, I get what you're saying. Like PlayStation and like the horizon zero dawn spin off in VR looks 25 2000 times more interesting than fucking fake Zuckerberg talking to fake people in their little fake world chat service that whatever they're calling it horizon metaverse it just looks it looks like 90s chat avatar fuck it looks like that Commodore 64 chat thing that people were doing on the 300 baud modems 30 years ago, there's
6051140	6057260	nothing revolutionary about it. And it looks like a waste of time and money and resources to be quite honest.
6057540	6080820	There's gosh, I don't even remember the games called now but there's a free game that you can play on VR that has like a bunch of these little mini games in there. It's like I want to say it's a game room or something but it's not game room because that's that's PlayStation thing but there's something like that. It's like a VR game room. That looks better than this and that's that's you
6080820	6100060	know, a free thing and you can play that with just any old headset like honestly like I wouldn't spend more than a few hundred dollars on a headset because especially like let's just say you want to go all out and spend that kind of money it's going to be outdated in a few years like you've just dumped that money and they're like well it's like a PC
6100060	6102700	chat is pinch hitting with rec room by the way Logie
6102780	6120140	rec room Yes, thank you. That's what I see. So it just looks awful. Like it's in this is meta like I don't trust them at all. Like honestly wouldn't trust them. Look at it look at a valve index maybe or something like that. Save yourself some money.
6120140	6150100	bonds 006 and chat says do we get a Rob's rant? No, I don't think so. Because I've made my distaste of Facebook getting into this space in the first place and gaming in general and so forth. And, you know, I understand why they bought Oculus I don't think, you know, I you know, whatever I have no, there's no rant for me. And I you know, Bobby does make a good point that like professionally, there might be something here. I still think meta is trying to target it beyond that based on you know, those other things.
6150340	6180060	But it's not like I have a rant in general about VR. I will absolutely pick up the PlayStation VR two on the PlayStation five when it comes out because that's going to have the stuff I'm I want to play. Because I'll tell you fake Zuckerberg and chatting with him in that space looks like a waste of my fucking time. And that's the rant you'll get is that they just like again, a game is only as good as our system is always good as the games that are on it and all that all that stuff, right? This, there's nothing here for me, but maybe that's okay that there's
6180060	6183420	nothing here for me. But good luck to meta making money.
6183860	6193260	And they're pushing that like the Microsoft Office Suite is coming to to this device like, okay, well, aside from like having like virtual
6193260	6194740	get better for free.
6194740	6224020	Like, why would you spend 1500 dollars to just do office in VR? Like, I can't imagine how that's gonna increase productivity at all. It's not it's gonna be in plus you're wearing the hat, you're gonna wear the headset for eight hours in a day. Well, one, the battery is not gonna support it. Number one. And number two, that would give you such a migraine. And it would be super inefficient. Like, I just don't see the point of it.
6225460	6228180	Cyberpathy is not a thing yet. It won't do any good.
6229300	6243300	It's just like, just don't spend the money. Like, if you're a business looking to get into VR for like, you know, like these training things that like Rob was talking about, like, you can do it for cheaper. Like you could so do it for cheaper and not use meta.
6243460	6273220	Yeah. All right. Anyhow, good thoughts and prayers to meta. All right, moving on. Let's talk about something. This actually came up in the last week, we were out last week, remember, because we were talking about TwitchCon. But we had, you know, the new Mario trailer came out. And I think there are some things we still want to say about it, even though it's last week's news. And I think the reactions and so forth are continuing into this week. So let me ask
6273220	6276820	the panel and all of you in chat. What do you think?
6279460	6284420	I think it looks great. Like people have a problem with Chris Pratt's voice in it because it sounds
6284420	6289300	like Chris Pratt. I loved him in like the Lego movie and the other stuff that he's done.
6289300	6295620	And like you're judging his performance based on literally seconds of audio.
6297220	6298420	I just don't like Chris Pratt.
6299300	6303220	That's fine. You don't have to like Chris Pratt, but like, I don't think it's going to be
6303860	6307220	like horrible. I don't think it's going to completely ruin the movie.
6308500	6312580	They're trying to like it seems like people are trying to get and I get it. They want Charles
6312580	6318340	Martinet to do the voice for Mario. And maybe there's a reason why they're not doing that,
6318340	6322980	because he's in the movie is playing the other characters. And it's probably because Mario's
6322980	6326660	dad, I'm telling you, that's the cameo he's going to end up as Mario's dad.
6326900	6334660	I mean, it's. I don't know, but like, I don't find like Chris Pratt super annoying in this.
6334660	6341940	I think that like Jack Black is Bowser is friggin awesome. Like it just he stole the trailer,
6341940	6346660	like just absolutely stand out. I think it looks good. I think it looks good. I'm excited to see
6346660	6353060	it. Like I said, we let's just like at least see some more footage of this other than judging it
6353860	6358820	by just his interpretation of it. Like, I get it. It's going to be different. Like,
6360100	6364100	but just give it a chance. Like what what people are trying to do is they're like, see,
6364100	6368340	we did this with Sonic. We're going to fix the game. We're going to fix the movie. We're going
6368340	6372020	to complain and complain until they change the voice and make it Charles Martinet.
6373620	6380100	I just don't think it needs it. I love Charles Martinet. I think he's fantastic. I think two
6380100	6386580	hours of that, you know, turned up because that's a lot of, you know, dialed up to 11 that
6386580	6390660	performance. I think two hours of that would be a bit much. I think he would know. I think he's
6390660	6394900	professional enough to know how to tone it down for a movie. Yes. Have some restraint. He would
6394900	6400340	be able to like dial it back and stuff because it's not just a video game. Like, I think he
6400340	6406340	could do it. And I get it. Like it's you don't even need a big actor. Like if the thought is,
6406340	6410820	oh, we need to get Chris Pratt in here. So people come see the movie. Yeah. It's a Super Mario movie.
6410820	6415220	Like no one's going to care that it's Chris Pratt doing the voice or like kids aren't going to care.
6415220	6420420	Oh, I only want to see that Chris Pratt movie. You know, it's like they're coming to see Mario.
6420420	6427380	That's what it is. I like the trailer more than you might think I did. I'm actually with Tiger
6427380	6431940	Claw with something he said in chat here. This might surprise you, but I actually am. I'm really
6431940	6437060	big on this. Tiger Claw says the new Super Mario movie looks like what if Nintendo made a new Mario
6437060	6442260	game in 4k? Because the attention to detail on Bowser is just astounding. We're so used to
6442260	6447460	these characters in such a way. Because Nintendo always draws these characters with less details.
6447460	6452020	And for me, Tiger Claw hit it on the head. If not, if nothing else, this trailer makes me
6452020	6456420	incredibly frustrated. Nintendo can't get with the fucking times when it comes to current gaming
6456420	6460580	hardware. And I get it. That's their vision. That's not where they want. That's not necessarily
6460580	6464660	where they want to be. Maybe they want to do this for the movies. Nintendo is not going to cry for
6464660	6468260	me because they're just going to laugh and laugh and laugh while they're rolling in that Uncle
6468260	6476100	Scrooge Money pit. But yeah, it makes me go, fuck, I wish this was a game. You know? But yeah,
6476100	6480260	Jack Black as Bowser was good. The whole thing with the penguins and that whole sequence was cute.
6481700	6486100	Chris Pratt, you know, in the interest of fairness, you're right, we didn't get enough of
6486100	6489700	him. But this was your chance to show it off. And I think they blew it.
6490500	6498020	I am to be fair, like, it also it doesn't help that he like sold it. Like, you know, I've,
6498020	6504980	I've really like, come up with this unique voice. It's like, it's just your voice. Like, like, and
6504980	6509620	let's be honest, like the Lego movie and stuff. I love the Lego movie and I love them it and stuff,
6509620	6514580	but it's just Chris Pratt's voice. Like, it's not like he's doing anything unique with it.
6514580	6520020	Jack Black is Bowser. I don't hear Jack Black in that. Like, that just sounds like a completely
6520020	6525620	unique character. Keegan-Michael Kay as Toad was as Toad. That's gonna be awesome. And even Charlie
6525620	6531940	Day as Luigi. I love it. I think it's gonna be great. I'm gonna give it a chance. For those that
6531940	6537380	are just oversaturated with Chris Pratt, which I'm kind of there too, although I like all the
6537380	6541700	other people in the movie. So I feel like I'm just going to tolerate it. But I think DJ Rama S has a
6541700	6544900	great idea. Dark Soccer, I don't know if you've heard this one because I know you've, you've,
6544900	6549460	you've had your fill of Chris Pratt, but DJ Rama S said, check out the trailer in a different
6549460	6555460	language because some of the other voice actors in the other languages are different. And so I
6555460	6560180	was like, Oh yeah, the French one sounds good. Yeah. Watching the Mario movie in Japanese might
6560180	6566180	actually be super interesting. So I thought that was an interesting sort of way to enjoy the movie,
6566180	6572980	even if you don't want to hear Chris Pratt. So fifth dream in chat says Danny DeVito for Mario.
6572980	6576900	No, no, no, no. They're, they are saving him for the Zelda movie so he can play Tingle. Remember?
6577780	6579780	Danny DeVito for Wario.
6582020	6586820	That would be such a good sequel. That would be such a good sequel. All right.
6588900	6593780	DJ Rama S in chat says the fact that the Brazilian and German Marios gave Mario an Italian accent.
6594740	6598740	All right. Let's move on. I know that was last week's news, but people, let's be real. People
6598740	6602580	are still talking about it this week. And yeah, there's some things from last week we had to get
6602580	6607940	out. All right. Moving on. Loki. I feel like this, this story keeps coming up over and over again.
6607940	6613460	It's like the onion layers keep unpeeling and the situation gets worse, right? Loki? Because I feel
6613460	6618580	like we've reported on this like three times, but it's worse. This was last month. So 2k had,
6619460	6625380	they had a data breach when hackers were able to get access to their support desk. And
6626900	6632340	they were basically impersonating the official channel in order to get a hold of people's data.
6633220	6639940	And at, at the time they weren't sure what had been taken, but now, now they know.
6641620	6645780	So it says that there was an email sent out to those who were affected by
6646660	6651700	no indication of any financial information or passwords held on our systems were compromised.
6652580	6655540	They were just able to get hold of, you know, the non-important stuff like, you know,
6655540	6660340	some personal data that was recorded when you contacted us for support, including your email
6660340	6667220	address, help desk ID, gamer tag, and console details. You know, not important stuff, of course.
6667780	6675380	Um, and that data had been put up for sale online. So everybody that's been affected
6675380	6683140	will be receiving, um, a request to reset their passwords, um, and also keep an eye on their
6683140	6689620	account for suspicious activity. I'm like, do I have a 2k account? I don't even know.
6689620	6694500	Like, I guess I need to just play borderlands. You may have one with the original borderlands. Yeah.
6695220	6698340	Yeah. I'm thinking the civilization games. I don't know if I need it.
6699220	6701300	So like we haven't, I don't think I've ever contacted.
6702180	6708260	I know I haven't. So probably not. Okay. Good to know. All right. Well, uh, one of the other
6708260	6712180	big things that came up in the past couple of weeks, but, um, it's continuing on into this
6712180	6717060	week, of course, is Overwatch two's launch. Uh, and some of the news we got this week is that
6717060	6722820	Blizzard is going to be doing, uh, their apology tour 2022 for some of the aspects of, uh,
6722820	6729140	Overwatch two's launch. Look, here's the thing. Here's the thing. If you were pissed off at what
6729140	6734100	happened with Overwatch two, the first day, clearly you've never been around for a game when it
6734100	6739060	launches and it's, it's launch day ever before. I think it's the other stuff though. Like,
6739060	6746260	like the fact that they're requiring you to have an actual phone to like to be able to log in or
6746260	6751940	like the fact that they did backtrack on that. If you've played the game in 2021, that that would,
6751940	6755780	that would, uh, reactivate your account for, since you don't need a phone to tie it to it.
6755780	6760420	So that was one of the things that they changed after the launch. Um, but some of the other things
6760420	6763780	are going to do to sorta like, you know, entice fans to keep checking it out, you know what,
6763780	6768260	but here's, here's the thing at the end of the day, they're not exactly crying because they
6768260	6773140	also are touting 25 million people have played the game so far. So this has definitely pushed the
6773140	6778260	game Overwatch, you know, in general, back to the forefront of a lot of gamers minds.
6778260	6781940	So blizzard's doing okay. You know, as far as this whole thing's concerned,
6782580	6786260	because I think people wanted to check it out. I'm not sure necessarily the people are continuing
6786260	6790980	with it. I'll be very curious what it looks like in a month for sure. But some ways that
6790980	6794980	blizzard is going to try to sweeten it up a little bit. They're going to do some double match XP
6794980	6800020	weekends, which will help you, uh, level through your battle pass even quicker. If you log in
6800020	6805620	between October 25th and the end of season one, you can get a captain Reaper, legendary skin,
6806180	6810340	and a health pack weapon charms. Those are kind of the, I think the weapon charms are all new
6810340	6813460	and they're pretty cool. Uh, those are automatically added to your collection.
6813460	6817540	If you log in within that period of time, uh, blizzard's also talking about more stability
6817540	6821220	updates. Uh, there's going to be another patch this week and there'll be looking for other
6821220	6825540	issues and bugs as they come up. So, um, that's, that's all good. You know, again,
6825540	6829700	I had a good time when I played the other night, I actually was really happy. My account merge
6829700	6837300	finished. And so I got all of the skins from my PC, my Xbox that like the week that they were
6837300	6842260	doing it free, like a free trial. I played it and I got some rare stuff and a PlayStation I had on
6842260	6846980	PlayStation as well. And I had some rare skins. Those are all finally merged. So I was like,
6846980	6851300	shit, I actually have a lot of skins in this game from just having like played it on several
6851300	6857780	different devices previously. So that, that alone made Overwatch two for me, like worth checking
6857780	6864340	out is always like, Oh damn, I still have a lot of, um, cosmetics and things to mess around with.
6864340	6872420	And Sombra is still a lot of fun to play. Just saying. All right. Let's go back to a classic
6872420	6879300	time when you did not need a, uh, cell phone in order to, uh, play a fun game, mostly because
6879300	6882500	cell phones didn't really exist yet. Uh, let's go into this next segment.
6887780	6898340	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
6898340	6903300	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
6905220	6912020	And Dark Sakura, what is the classic handheld of the month? Because once a month you mix it up and
6912020	6919140	do a handheld beer, going the Coleco route and going for the Coleco tabletop arcade collection,
6919780	6929700	which I always, always wanted and never could get. Um, my, my, uh, cousin had, had one and it was,
6930580	6939060	they were, they were fine. So, um, the, these were made and released in 1982 by Coleco,
6939060	6948180	same Coleco of the ColecoVision and the Coleco Adam. Um, they were mini arcade cabinet replicas
6948980	6955380	and, uh, they were pretty, pretty cool. Um, they'd had success with their electronic
6955380	6960740	quarterback in the past and with, you know, the different successes that they had with
6960740	6967060	those systems, they decided to do the miniature tabletop arcade games. They had licenses from Sega
6967620	6974180	Midway and Nintendo. They did their first four, which was Pac-Man, Donkey Kong,
6974740	6981380	Galaxian and Frogger. They were an instant hit. They sold over 3 million units by the end of the
6981380	6994740	year. And Pac-Man sold 1.5 million units alone and they expanded it in 1983. They did, uh,
6994740	7001220	Ms. Pac-Man, Donkey Kong Jr. and Zaxxon. Um, they were marketed as the arcade games that you can
7001220	7007700	take with you. They used it, used a VFD, a vacuum fluorescent display. So it was really high quality
7007700	7018820	for its day and really just nice. They, um, they, the ones that Atari was doing were, you know,
7018820	7025620	especially on the 2600, they're pretty crude versions. Cliko ones were, were a step above
7025620	7036100	that. They were in production from 1982, 1983 and discontinued in 1984. They, uh, they were preceded
7036100	7042820	by the Cliko head to head series and they were the last, uh, from what I can tell that Cliko made.
7042820	7049300	They did have two in process that were, uh, ended up unreleased and canceled. There was supposed to
7049300	7058500	be Berserk and Omega Race. But I mean, like I had seen these in movies and the Zaxxon one was pretty
7058500	7068020	freaking big. And you know, like I said, my, um, my cousin had one and I like, it was the second
7068020	7073780	generation of them. The ones that came out in 93 were bigger, wider screens. But you know, there's
7073780	7079460	just something pretty special about these. You know, it was your own little mini arcade cabinet
7079460	7085700	and we have an outgrown dad arcade one up. So I don't have one sitting behind me right now or
7085700	7090740	anything. I don't have three of them on the floor, not the cabinet like you have, but the smaller
7091540	7099700	tabletop ones. But I mean, it was, it really was just miles ahead of what anyone else was
7099700	7106820	doing at the time. You know, good on Cliko for making them, although, you know, they,
7106820	7113620	they went into their own home console business too. And I must say that the Cliko vision
7114340	7124420	was also well above what Atari was doing. Cliko vision and the Atari 5200 are probably the
7124420	7130100	closest comparison for game versions. Although I do still think Cliko vision versions of some
7130100	7134420	of these games are better, but going back to the handhelds, they were cool. If you can find them,
7134420	7143460	holy shit. Yeah, right guys, if you guys find a Galaxian, give it to me. The end.
7143460	7151940	All right. There it is the classic handheld of the month. I had a friend who had these and they
7151940	7156500	were so cool. Like again, yeah, you have to remember this was 1982. You know, the tech
7156500	7162020	and these things for the time was awesome. They may look look really rudimentary now. But like,
7162020	7167060	this was this was it like when we were kids. Yeah, this is a contemporary of some of the
7167060	7173380	other ones that I've mentioned. And this was way, way ahead of its time, especially with the nature
7173380	7177860	of the display that it used. And yeah, maybe Donkey Kong looks like a purple blob. But it's
7177860	7183860	playable. Yeah, it's playable. Tiger Claw is dropping some links in chat over archive.org,
7183860	7188900	where you can actually play the games online. You know, granted, it's not quite the same thrill
7188900	7193380	playing it in a browser window is like playing the little device and so forth. But it's a it's
7193380	7200580	a nice little way to, you know, kind of remember what it was archive.org slash details slash hh
7200580	7207300	underscore C D Kong will get you to Donkey Kong. That's what search and from the hour just do a
7207300	7212180	web search. And from there, I'm sure you can find all the others. So pretty cool. All right. Great
7212180	7217140	pick dark soccer. Thanks for sharing. All right. I can't believe we only have two handhelds left.
7217140	7219860	And then we have to start thinking about what are you gonna do in 2023?
7220740	7226820	Fuck me. All right. Um, I'll take some suggestions. Hit me up on the twatters.
7227620	7233860	Sorry, the twitters. And DM me your suggestions. I'll like the best one and take credit for it.
7233860	7235380	Yeah. Getting getting getting.
7236180	7243860	I have I have an eye. Can I can I pitch my idea? Sure. Okay. So this might be a little weird. I
7243860	7246340	don't know. I'd have to see what the what the listeners think about this. But that's why I'm
7246340	7250660	going to pitch it live. So instead of the classic game of the week, every month, you're going to
7250660	7258100	pick one game that's destined to be a classic. They're all eventually going to be classic.
7258100	7263220	They're all getting old time. I guess that's true by your rules of a classic game of the week.
7263220	7268020	You've got you've covered some pretty crap games. So anything can be a classic game of the week. It
7268020	7271300	just has to be, you know, something that's impacted us in one way or another for better
7271300	7279060	or for worse. So highlight company shut down by EA. Stop. Oh, classic game studio. Ah,
7279700	7286100	that might be interesting. We'll see. All right. Classic mod. Maybe. I don't know. We'll see. All
7286100	7290660	right. There could be some fun things. All right. Tweeter tweet. I know you all are in chat, but
7290660	7294580	we'll forget after the show tonight. Send dark soccer tweet. Those last much longer.
7294580	7299140	Do me a tweet. All right. Even even though her Twitter gonna blow up tonight. All right.
7300100	7303460	Well, my Twitter's already done been blowing up, so whatevs.
7304180	7308100	All right. Moving on. Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other
7308100	7311460	news around the industry that's happening this week. Loki.
7312420	7317780	Yeah, there was a promotional video that came out from Valve showing off the steam deck.
7318500	7324260	Unfortunately, they said the quiet part out loud that the steam deck is a great device to use for
7324260	7333620	emulation. And they had a Yuzu featured in there. The switch emulator in their video. Whoops. They
7333620	7341220	have now fixed that problem, but it is funny to see that, you know. It's well known for
7342340	7350420	play switch games on the steam deck. It's like a big switch. And then the final fantasy seven
7350420	7358660	battle royale game, the final seven first soldier is going to be shutting down January 11th, 2023.
7359460	7366420	Launched last year and apparently wasn't popular enough for Square Enix to keep it going. So
7367220	7374100	they will be shutting it down. I forgot that this even came out.
7376100	7378660	I did too, and that's probably part of the problem, to be honest.
7379620	7386500	Yeah. All right. Moving on. Sorry. I just a really funny one that just came up in Chat Dark Sakura.
7386500	7392180	The classic classic game of the week segment where we go back and we pick a segment that's
7392180	7399780	10 years or older and re-air it. What I might be. I'll tell you actually what I'm thinking
7399780	7406660	about doing is classic game All-Stars. Okay. Oh, okay. Like Dragula Titans,
7406660	7410420	Drag Race All-Stars. We're the best of the best compete.
7411060	7418340	And more than that, I'm thinking what we do is all three of us pick one the week before.
7420500	7426900	And we have, or we put it on Twitter and we have our listeners vote.
7426900	7429540	Are you talking about a classic game royale?
7430500	7438740	I am. We start off, we each pick a game, keeping it on the same system.
7438740	7444100	Classic cage match would throw it way back. Classic gaming cage match.
7444100	7449700	Oh, I think we got to do that. A classic cage match. Oh, that's good.
7449700	7456420	So we announced the games the week before the cage match. We put up a vote on our Twitter.
7456420	7461940	And so how do we make it so that Loki's game doesn't win every single month?
7461940	7466900	Well, we don't say whose game is what we just put the three games based on the game.
7468180	7476180	And then there's a review. Then reveal yourself who picked what game? Ah, okay. All right.
7476180	7480580	And also, it's really awesome because I pulled that out of my ass right the moment I said it.
7480580	7484340	And SS Joe and her mat says got to have a theme for every month. And I
7484340	7489620	say we let a listener pick the theme. No, I pick it. This is my second.
7491140	7494340	Okay, you pick the theme. But I'll be happy to take suggestions.
7498020	7502420	Don't take this from me. No, it's I love it. The classic cage
7502420	7507220	match is great. It's a great classic gaming cage match. Classic gaming cage match. Oh,
7507700	7514020	we've already picked before. It can be Why not? Why not? All right.
7514020	7518660	I have a pretty extensive list. All right. I'm excited. 2023 needs to
7518660	7523220	hurry up and get here. All right. In the meantime, oh, I shit I have a rapid fire
7523220	7530660	story. I'm supposed to talk about Hello. Oh, yes. CD Projekt Red is making a sequel to Cyberpunk
7530660	7536020	2077. There's a part of me that says of course they are but at the same time the way that game
7536020	7541700	was received may actually be a little bit surprising. So there were some slightly better
7541700	7546820	now. Yeah, there were some slides. Well, and to throw back a couple weeks ago, we were talking
7546820	7553940	about Google stadia. Let us not forget for the stadia people. This game was fine. It was always
7553940	7559700	fine. So it's just interesting how that's all worked out. Anyway, um, CD Projekt is still
7559700	7564020	super pissed. I know I know I'm so no, I'm more pissed that they're putting out a cloud gaming
7564020	7571060	system now. I didn't even hear about that. What? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'll find the details. Go
7571060	7576580	ahead. Okay, find the details. But but let me finish for you interrupt. All right. So CD
7576580	7581780	Projekt is doing a new they were announcing upcoming projects. So in a slide they talked
7581780	7587460	about this interesting because they were revealing project names, such as project Canis Majoris,
7587460	7592100	which is a story driven single player open world RPG within the Witcher universe.
7592100	7595780	So I mean, it sounds like the Witcher four, but it could be a spin off game, who knows.
7596340	7602020	But then there was a game called Project Orion, cyberpunk 2077 sequel that will prove the full
7602020	7608660	power and potential of the cyberpunk universe. So in so they're gonna they're gonna try again,
7608660	7613780	I wonder if they aren't going to recycle the engine to make a new game to try to save on dev
7613780	7619860	time, that would be a very smart thing to do. Now that they've figured things out. I found the thing
7619860	7627700	by the way, go ahead. So there, Google is doing Chromebooks built for cloud gaming.
7629140	7637380	They're working with Acer, Asus and Lenovo. And this came out on the 11th of this month,
7638100	7642820	just after the stadia thing, which proves to me that this has nothing to do with stadia
7642820	7651460	management. This came from higher up at Google. I can see it no other way.
7651460	7656500	Yeah. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some things we'll be seeing a lot
7656500	7661380	sooner than the classic cage match of the month. The world release dates. Loki, what's coming out
7661380	7668740	in the US? We have a Plague Tale Requiem on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation five and Xbox series.
7668820	7670820	It's on Game Pass, by the way, I've been looking forward to it.
7671620	7678100	Ghostbusters spirits unleashed on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.
7679060	7684820	Them's fighting herds, I think coming out of early access on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four,
7684820	7690100	PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series. The people who did fight of animals, is it? No.
7690900	7696740	It's the one that was going to be the my little pony fighting game, but then they had to make it
7696740	7703620	not legally distinct by a little pony fighting game. So now that's coming out.
7703620	7705700	I mean, it's all things considered.
7708020	7719380	Last hero of nostalgia on PC, Xbox one, Xbox series. The last worker on PC. We have uncharted
7719380	7728740	Legacy of Thieves collection also on PC. We've got Dragon Quest 10 online, all in one package,
7728740	7735060	version one through six. That's the name on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.
7735780	7743940	We have the Jackbox Party Pack nine on PC, Mac and Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four,
7743940	7749620	PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series, Cestadia. I don't know about that. And Luna.
7751700	7759380	We've got Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope on Nintendo Switch, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher
7759380	7770340	on Nintendo Switch. And let's see, Warhammer 40,000, Shootas, Blood and Teeth. And that's
7770420	7776340	going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series,
7777220	7784020	Gotham Knights on PC, PlayStation five and Xbox series, New Tales from the Borderlands on PC,
7784020	7790340	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series, Persona five,
7790340	7797220	Royale on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. That is it.
7798100	7805220	Oh, is that all? All right. Moving over to Japan on the Nintendo Switch, Ultra Kaiju Monster
7805220	7810900	Rancher is out this week on the 20th of October as is Space Marshals collection.
7811940	7816420	Not the Space Marshals is not ringing a bell, but there were three Space Marshals games. I don't
7816420	7821140	know why this doesn't ring a bell, but yeah, Space Marshals one, two and three in a collection on the
7821140	7826900	Switch. Let's see. We also have a Harmonia getting a English release, but it is in Japan. It's just
7826900	7832900	not localized. There's also Lego Brawls is out in Japan this week. This is pretty cool. A Dragon
7832900	7838180	Quest 10 online all in one package with versions one through six. So it's basically like a Uber
7838180	7843860	version of Dragon Quest 10. That is out on the Switch in Japan this week as well. And if we move
7843860	7852980	over to Oh, of course, I should. Sorry, nevermind. We'll go over to the PlayStation five. And I will
7853060	7860580	mention Lego Brawls, Human Fall Flat are both out there as well. And PlayStation five gets a Gran
7860580	7867860	Turismo seven bundle. So they're actually releasing a Gran Turismo seven, like PlayStation five. Is
7867860	7874660	that just did they just do a different? No, I think it's literally just the same old console
7874660	7881380	with the game. Okay. All right. I thought I thought they would do like a special controller or
7881380	7886660	something but doesn't look like it. All right. Also on the PlayStation five, Persona five,
7886660	7892340	The Royal is out in Japan this week on the 21st. How about Europe Dark Soccer?
7894100	7902740	On 18th on Xbox, we have a Plague Tale Requiem. Also on the 18th, we have them's Fighting Hearts
7902740	7910420	and Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed. On the 20th, we have Mario plus Rabid Sparks of Hope on Switch
7910420	7916500	and also on Switch Matchpoint Tennis Championships Legend Edition. On the 21st for
7916500	7922820	PlayStation and Xbox, we have Gotham Knights. And adding Switch to that we have Persona five Royal,
7923540	7931620	also Fell Seal Arbiter's Mark, New Tales from the Borderlands, also on the 21st.
7934660	7940100	Excellent. We have to send a little ASMR. I'm very sorry because I hate ASMR.
7940100	7942980	No, we talked about it at the beginning of the show. You're a little under the weather
7942980	7948980	and it's affecting your voice. So let's have Loki and I take a couple headlines here and then we'll
7948980	7953620	get to the listener roundtable tonight. So Loki, what do you have to talk about with us?
7957460	7968340	All right. It's another week, another lawsuit, right? So Activision now has another lawsuit
7969220	7978100	that is talking about more sexual harassment allegations. Revenge porn is another part of this
7978100	7982500	as well. Which is illegal in the state of California, by the way, where, you know,
7982500	7985940	Blizzard's located. I don't know what studio this is, but yeah.
7985940	7993220	So this was filed in LA by an unnamed former employee of the company and targets Activision
7993220	8000260	Blizzard along with the former manager of this employee, Miguel Vega. And they alleged that
8000260	8006740	Activision Blizzard's failure to curb sexist and harassing conduct emboldened the manager
8006740	8014980	to abuse belittle and insult of the one making this claim, making comments about her about oral
8014980	8020820	sex masturbation and orgasms threatening her job. If she would not consent to sex, mocking her
8020820	8027140	breasts comment are commenting on other females, employees, attractiveness, also repeatedly threat
8027140	8037540	to expose a compromising photo of her as well. And then apparently one, the, they were, she
8037540	8046180	reported her concerns. They immediately opened an investigation and Mr. Vega was terminated within
8046180	8058820	10 days, according to Activision. Also it says that, I mean, it's just, it's just sexual harassment.
8058820	8065860	It goes into more details about like groping and attempting sexual harassment, you know, abuse and
8065860	8075860	just terrible shit. Yep. So I got nothing. This is, this is a problem that needs to be, I mean,
8076660	8082660	at least he was fired pretty immediately, but, uh, it should have happened before any of this and
8082660	8087700	recognized before any of this ever happened. So, I mean, it's one of those things like, I, I, I
8087700	8092100	don't know what nice thing to say about this because there is nothing nice about it, but I will
8092100	8098660	say it's an industry problem and we need to, and probably goes beyond the video game industry too.
8098660	8105060	And shitty people need to stop coming to power. Well, right. And these people are, you know,
8105060	8108340	it seems like we're hearing about more and more of these people at the company. It's not like
8108340	8116740	one-offs almost because they're just seeing leadership above them kind of doing the same
8116740	8122660	thing or condoning this behavior. And so, like they said, it emboldens them to just continue
8122660	8131140	it on and starts at the top. Right. I agree. That's why I've been screaming until I
8131140	8137060	turned blue. Bobby Kotick has no place in this industry. And every day he still sits at the top
8137060	8143540	of a major company is disgusting. Moving on. I need something lighthearted and fun. Loki,
8143540	8145620	please change the topic to something completely different.
8146660	8156180	Uh, yes. So apparently, uh, the, there was a Kingdom Hearts TV series that, um, was
8156180	8162580	supposed to come out and then they got canceled. So the series was directed and developed by
8162580	8175940	discovery. Um, it was no Disney TV. And apparently, um, he back in 2018, or I guess
8175940	8182820	recently he's was in a serious car crash, I guess in January that almost cost him his life. So he
8182820	8188020	figured that he wanted to, uh, share the work with the world. Um, you know, put it out there
8188020	8194660	in case anything bad happened to him. Um, he posted the video it's been pulled off the internet
8194660	8201460	or at least his channel, but I mean, search for lost Kingdom Hearts pilot animatic, and you can
8201460	8208500	check it out and it kind of shows, you know, just an animatic for what the pilot episode would have
8208500	8216180	been. And it's, it's looks like, yeah. I mean, I could see this being like kind of a Saturday
8216180	8220900	morning cartoon type thing. Yeah. I'm surprised Disney never, I'm surprised Disney never tried
8220900	8224980	to make Kingdom Hearts more mainstream. And yeah, it was super easy to find.
8224980	8229940	You know, I've, I've complained about this on the show before, and I think Dark Soccer,
8229940	8234500	you brought it up and Loki probably mentioned it too, is that, you know, when we were really
8235140	8239940	obsessed with Disneyland and I'm saying that and realizing, oh, and Dark Soccer just went on Monday
8239940	8244580	after TwitchCon. Did you see anything Kingdom Hearts related in the parks?
8245460	8251300	I did. Oh, oh, all right. I saw people wearing, wearing shirts and I bought pins.
8251860	8255460	Okay. I've already bought, there were already a few Kingdom Hearts pins and
8256020	8259060	there were, um, I want to say I saw some ornaments.
8259060	8263700	Yeah. But you know, I just, and especially 10 years ago and when, you know, Kingdom Hearts,
8263700	8266260	when there wasn't a Kingdom Hearts three yet and one and two were still,
8266260	8269940	I was always surprised in the parks. There's a Sora mascot in Japan.
8270980	8276420	Right. But not here. I'm, I'm still always kind of like blown away that Disney did not
8276420	8280260	really throw more weight behind Kingdom Hearts. And I just assume some of that must've been
8280260	8283460	complications with the square agreement and just what they could and couldn't do.
8283460	8290100	But it's just so wild to me that Disney, I mean, yeah, I just purchase everything. I'm
8290100	8293540	surprised. I just don't know why they didn't put more weight into Kingdom Hearts, you know?
8294420	8297300	Like if they wanted to, they could just buy Square Enix and be like, okay,
8297300	8301300	we own you now that we can do whatever we want with this. I mean, like, I don't know.
8302180	8306900	Um, dartitsuyu in chat says, I do remember seeing Sora and interventions. I think the last time I
8306900	8311540	went was 2005. Yeah. The intervention building, which by the way, I think it's a restaurant now.
8311540	8314500	Didn't you say that? It is. Yeah. It was a skyline terrace.
8314500	8318820	So before that, uh, it was, you know, it was America Sings years and years ago,
8318820	8323140	but then it was a building that was like showing exhibitions of, of like science and they,
8323140	8326900	I think they did Marvel photo ops for a bit. I don't think it was ever America Sings.
8327460	8333060	I thought it was, it was like America, not America Sings, America 3d or something.
8333620	8341700	It was, it was, um, it had like this 3d like, um, uh, crap. What was that? An incredible journey
8341700	8353780	body thing, but it had that was another thing in there. But, um, but they had like lots of stuff
8353780	8358900	sponsored by like DuPont and different industrial things. Cause they were the donors for the park.
8360180	8365140	And so that's what the innovations building was for. But I do remember for a short time to go
8365140	8369540	back to dartitsuyu's comment, they, they did show like video gamey things in there. I remember Xbox
8369540	8373780	360 connect was like a thing they were showing in there and they would like the Disneyland game
8373780	8378580	was on connect. Remember that that was definitely in the interventions building. So I think they
8378580	8383700	Sora was probably in there tied to like video games or the future, you know, type of thing that
8383700	8388260	was in there. So yeah, they probably had like a big, you know, Sora standee or something that
8388260	8394900	sat in there. So it makes sense. All right. Well, speaking of Disney, I didn't, uh, totally mean to,
8394900	8397940	to try it, but I guess when you bring up kingdom hearts, you're going to, um,
8399220	8406020	there's going to be some new features coming to Disney dreamlight valley, which a lot of people,
8406020	8410740	especially a lot of streamers have been getting into. Uh, I still am kind of like,
8410740	8414420	eh, it's early access. I'll wait until they've, they've fleshed it out a little more with some
8414420	8420100	features and some of the features that they're going to be working on include interacting with
8420100	8425540	your animal companions. And this all came out in an interview, uh, that was, uh, happening on,
8425540	8429620	I guess the official Twitter feed, there was a survey and, uh, the survey asked,
8429620	8435620	do you want to be able to interact with your animal companions? Uh, that is so they,
8435620	8439700	they wrote a tweet that said, Hey, valley villagers, we've been wondering, would you
8439700	8444500	like to be able to interact with your animal companions? And the choices were yes, yes,
8444500	8450580	or yes, in the next update. So, uh, pretty much way of confirming, uh, that that's going to be
8450580	8454900	happening, uh, there. So yeah, Disney, uh, dreamlight valley is going to be able to, uh,
8454900	8461140	pet your pets. So, uh, they'll have to update the website. Can you pet the dog? Although I don't
8461140	8465860	mean, I don't know if that means you can pet goofy, but just like your, your animal companions,
8465860	8470900	but we'll find out, maybe you can pet goofy as well. I don't know. So that tweet is already
8470980	8477620	starting an argument. The what? My tweet has already started a bit of a fuss. Oh boy.
8477620	8485700	I love it. All right. Meanwhile, come visit my Twitch channel to hear me say more about it.
8485700	8491860	What if they interpreted it as kicking them? And they'd be like, this is what you voted for.
8491860	8501540	What? What are you even saying? All right. Oh, kicking the animals. That's mean. Yeah,
8501540	8506820	that's mean. Who would vote for that? You should, whoever voted for that gets instantly blocked.
8506820	8511620	That's what should happen. And pet whichever cat that is talking. Oh, uh, that is, uh,
8511620	8519860	I think that's smush in the background. So. All right. Uh, let's, uh, let's move on and get into
8519860	8524500	the listener round table, where we invite you to email the show every week. Participate
8524500	8529460	at orange lounge, radio.com. I don't think we got emails this week though, if I recall correctly,
8529460	8532260	but I'll check with dark soccer. I know your voice is out. If I need to get in there and
8532260	8535940	read something, I can, but I don't even look, I'm sorry. I don't think we have anything to be
8535940	8541860	honest. Um, that's okay. Peek in there and let me know. Um, and if I need to jump in there, I will.
8541860	8548660	Usually all those get forwarded to my personal email too. One second. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
8548660	8553300	but again, if you want to email us for a future week, you sure can participate at orange lounge,
8553300	8560500	radio.com is the place to send those emails. All right. I didn't think so. Okay. Um, maybe you have
8560500	8567220	further questions or thoughts on Twitch con or the variety of, uh, uh, kickoff topics we had tonight,
8567220	8573700	uh, starting off the show, we will also invite your calls, uh, via our discord channel. Uh,
8573700	8579540	if you want to join our discord vog network.com slash discord, uh, is the place to chat with us
8579540	8582980	throughout the week. And it was, it was really active today with everything that's been going
8582980	8588020	on in the industry. If I may real quick. Yeah, of course. Um, I, I wanted to say this at the
8588020	8595220	start. My mom had to go into the ER. Um, and turns out she has a multifocal pneumonia. It just means
8595220	8599700	she's got different pockets of pneumonia in her lungs and she's in the hospital right now. And I
8599700	8606900	would greatly appreciate some positive sent her way. Absolutely. Absolutely. Send, send in some
8607700	8614660	positive feelings and keeping you on my thoughts. All right. Um, let's, uh, as I was saying,
8614660	8619700	we go to discord vog network.com slash discord. And if you want to call us live, you sure can in
8619700	8624020	the green room. And we actually have someone in the green room waiting to come on and join the
8624020	8629860	show right now. So let's get to it. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who is this? It is the
8629860	8635700	one and only DJ Ron mess. How's everybody doing tonight? I am doing great except this, uh, four
8635700	8640900	shot I have is completely messed up on Twitch. So I apologize for that. I will fix it. But, uh,
8640900	8644660	Rama wants to tell us what's on your mind tonight. You were just on Bobby show. You must have a lot
8644660	8650500	to say. Yes. I understand the whole redoing whole layout I've been doing. I'm working on a brand
8650500	8655220	new revision from my, from my Twitch stream. So fantastic. And this is my own fault. What
8655220	8662180	happened is when I designed this, it was, um, it was, uh, made for, uh, the Twitch window being
8662180	8668500	minimized and now it's like, it has to be maximized so you can see everybody. So there's
8668500	8673700	like, are you trying to say something? We should talk. If you're doing a redesign, we should talk.
8674740	8679620	Okay. I kind of doing something rough, but once I get it together, I'll send it your way. We can
8679620	8684580	plot something. Oh, I was like, why does dark soccer looks so smushed? But it's because Rama
8684580	8688980	is covering her. All right. Well, the podcast listeners are like, what are you even talking
8688980	8693540	about? I'm trying to fix a visual disaster right now. All right. That's all I'm doing. But when
8693540	8698100	doing a thing, when it's done, I don't have to do it again. This is very much a fuck it. We'll do it
8698100	8704180	live moment, but let's talk to you. Rama live. What is on your mind tonight? My friend. I wanted
8704180	8711300	to talk about what's going on with G four TV, but that can wait. Nothing. You know that. Wait. You
8711300	8717700	know what? You know what the G's stand for in G four. Gotcha. Going, going, going gone.
8719700	8724980	Yeah. I'm sorry. That's in poor taste. I'm sorry. I, but, but I can't help it. I can't, I can't
8724980	8732100	help. Look, I, I grieve through the use of humor. So it doesn't stand for G. I'm surprised it took
8732100	8739540	this long. Rama. What did you want to talk about tonight? Oh, this whole hello Taylor,
8739540	8748580	Jennifer Hale thing. Oh, sure. Sure. Girl. Okay. As you all know, I've been part of sort of part
8748580	8753300	of voice acting industry for awhile in the ways of knowing voice actors, hanging out with them,
8753300	8760180	interviewing general conversations with them. Yeah. And before I say anything,
8760980	8768260	every voice actor should be paid their worth. They should be paid royalties based off of the physical
8768260	8773700	copies being sold. The number of streams are being people watching streams with their voices
8773700	8781860	and so forth. Yep. Right. Right off the bat, like a TV actor or a movie actor. Yeah, exactly. And
8781860	8789140	it's interesting. I was interviewing a voice actor about that earlier today, but I want to pre I
8789140	8795140	appreciate y'all at OLR, Bobby and everybody in the discord chat breaking all of this down because
8795140	8799300	I'm at a convention. I had no idea what was going on. I'm picking it up piece by piece
8799300	8804580	as I'm figuring this out. Yeah. There's a little bit more to it because you know how they say
8804580	8810180	there are two sides to every story. Absolutely. Actually, there are four sides to every story.
8810180	8815380	I thought you were gonna say three, but yeah. What you said, what they said, what the people
8815380	8821700	think, and the truth. And by the time we get to here, nobody cares about this. Did you say what
8821700	8826740	we get to hear? What the people think? Is this what you said? Rama? Basically? Yeah. For those
8826740	8830260	on the podcast feed, he was using his fingers. And when he got to what the people think it was the
8830260	8835460	middle finger. So I just was re emphasizing that people think that's a good one. I always I've
8835460	8841700	heard your side my side in the truth. But that in this particular case, absolutely what the people
8841700	8848660	think is, is huge here. Yeah. What you said about this is correct, but because Helena Taylor
8848660	8852260	voice has been, nobody wants to hear nothing else. This is no different from another
8853060	8857380	drama with another voice actor that's going on. I've already mentioned that person's name in the
8857380	8863140	chat. Google it. When you see it, get some coffee, some soda, some popcorn. The transcripts are
8863140	8869140	wonderful, but that's besides the point. There is definitely more to this than what, than what
8869140	8876820	we're seeing here. I mean, how can you be so bitter at after that comment? I went and looked
8876820	8885540	at her IMDB. I'm just like, uh huh. I can see why she's bitter, but it was completely and totally
8885540	8892980	uncalled for. Go on, Rob. You know, you want to say, I can see it on your face. I just, that was
8892980	8899380	what you said was incredibly fucking shady. And I just had to, had to just stew in that for a
8899380	8906500	minute. But no, I get it. I get it. Maybe shady, but am I wrong? And you know what?
8906500	8914500	Show me the lie. Let's shade and shade alike. Exactly. And the fact of the matter is she's
8914500	8919460	trying to get people to boycott this game. That ain't happening. That's, you know, and you bring
8920260	8928420	I'm sorry. I support voice acting industry the absolute way that I can. Yeah. I am one of those
8928420	8932740	who will download fan subs, but when it becomes commercially available for me to watch it,
8932740	8937780	I will delete the fan subs. I will watch it streaming. I will buy the DVDs. I will buy
8937780	8944020	merge from it. I will support any way possible. I enjoy Bayonetta. I'm going to support this
8944020	8948660	because there's more to the what's going on. I am not canceling my pre-order. Not after the hell I
8948660	8953140	went through to get it the first time around. I'm not, I will. I will. I am not boycotting the game
8953860	8961620	based on one perspective alone until we know what the truth is here because that's it's playing
8961620	8969060	right into this. She's yeah. I, again, there's just a lot of stuff here, but what stinks Rama
8969060	8973860	is that there are a lot of people you say there, there are people on Twitter who are saying they're
8973860	8977300	going to boycott now, granted, how many of them were never going to buy it in the first place?
8977300	8981540	Probably a lot. Let's be real. This is how Twitter acts. People, people put on a front,
8981540	8984820	on Twitter all the time to look so fucking impressive. And it's like,
8984820	8990020	when you get to a certain age or I don't know when it's like, you see you, it's so transparent.
8990020	8995300	People's, you know, things, it's so transparent. You didn't cancel a pre-order. You're never going
8995300	8999620	to fucking buy it in the first place. You're not impressing anybody. I see right through you.
9000420	9004900	Now I'm sure there were some legitimate people. Show me your receipt. Yeah. And some people
9004900	9008660	did screenshot and show the receipt. I saw that too. I'm sure there's some that did,
9008660	9013540	but that isn't to say they're not going to go buy it anyway, but let's, let's see what happens
9013540	9020020	when more facts come out. Right. Now something similar happened. This is about within the last
9020020	9024740	month or so voice X, my name was Kyle McCarley. He put a video on his YouTube about a situation
9024740	9030820	where he's a voice of mob and mob cycle 100. Basically they were going to go into season three
9030820	9036340	and it was going to be non-union. So, you know, the rates and the pay is totally different.
9036980	9042900	He reached out to crunchy roll and the studio can we figure something out here so that we can have
9042900	9050020	the original cast to do this. It kind of fell upon deaf ears and he says, I'm not doing the role,
9050660	9056500	but in doing so in his video, he tells everybody, you know, continue to support as a whole,
9056500	9061460	you know, don't stop because of me, you know, continue to support, which is something I can
9061460	9067220	get behind. If I can't be part of a project because XYZ reason, I don't want people to
9067220	9072820	stop supporting said project because I'm not there. Because if you, even though I'm not there,
9072820	9077860	if you continue to support it, it could do something else, make your voice be heard. You
9077860	9084900	know, let me ask a question. I'm curious what you all think on this. Do you think Nintendo of Europe
9085620	9091940	goes to the length to sue Helena in court for trying to start a boycott of this game and
9091940	9097060	breaking her NDA? Do you think they sue her for defamation and breaking the NDA? Do they go to
9097060	9102500	that length? I honestly don't see it. They're just going to be like, okay, business as usual.
9102500	9108500	Now, if it's now after the game comes out, if they if the projections are lower than expected,
9109460	9116020	maybe. But that might fall under platinum games instead of Nintendo. But we'll see.
9116020	9122180	Well, it gets tricky when she's in the UK and platinum is in Japan. So I'm not you know,
9122180	9127460	and I'm not going to profess to be a legal expert on what country is that enforced under
9127460	9133780	and such and such. So my assumption is Nintendo did fund the game. So they but but but let me say,
9134660	9138900	do does whoever she signed the NDA with, which I guess would be platinum games,
9138900	9143380	so maybe they have a UK entity. So does platinum games sue Helena in Europe?
9144820	9151780	I honestly don't know. I honestly feel I think this is gonna be like a wait and see.
9151780	9157940	Let's see what come here has to say. That's it. Let's hear their side of the story before we
9157940	9161700	decide everybody's been giving him shit because he blocks everyone on Twitter, which I mean,
9161700	9165860	I'm not excusing his behavior. He's always been a dick. But that's like his personality is being
9165860	9169540	a dick. And I'm not saying being a dick should be a personality. But it's just one of those things
9169540	9176420	where it's like, I the only thing I found interesting was he did call it out in English,
9176420	9180900	and you know how much he fucking hates tweets in English. That is in lines with his character. And
9180900	9184100	he said in English, Damn it, I wish I had the tweet in front of me. But he fucking
9184100	9190980	works. Yeah, it's basically like, I want to find the tweet now because it's important.
9191700	9197620	It may be it may be screenshot it because I've seen it around. Yeah. But also to throw in there
9197620	9204820	about Helen Taylor's voice work. I can tell you this now, up into the pandemic. Oh, all the
9204820	9210420	police act if I may, if I may while it's in front of me, his tweet, sad and deplorable about the
9210420	9216260	attitude of untruth. That's what all I can tell now. And then he says, by the way, beware of my
9216260	9220580	rules where don't tweet at me in English or I'll block you and all the dicky things he's famous
9220580	9224740	for. But you know what, say what you will about Kamiya. I understand being addiction be a
9224740	9228500	personality, especially in the gaming industry where we have plenty of it already. However,
9228500	9233380	the fact that he did tweet that and say, he basically said she's lying. So he's saying
9233380	9240500	she's lying. So I'm very curious to see, you know, but again, I don't know if it's ever
9240500	9243380	in a place where we do see it unless it comes out in court documents.
9243380	9251140	Again, I honestly don't see it going to that length unless what she does causes a ripple
9251140	9258340	effect in the sales of the game. But let me just finish it with this and I'll be on my merry
9258340	9264420	little way. Yes, I did throw shade at her at the work that she's on IMDb because sometimes when you
9264420	9270500	put yourself out there, it's going to happen. But when it comes to voice acting up into the pandemic,
9271140	9275940	you had to be in the studio for it. So there really aren't that many.
9277460	9284100	All the anime is in the UK is being dubbed here in the US. So as she really wanted to get up there,
9284100	9290260	she would have to move from the UK to the US now during the pan at the beginning and the height of
9290260	9298740	the pan. Damn it. I know. Damn it. Yep. The pan. Damn it. They bought expensive microphones,
9298740	9303620	digital interfaces, upgraded internet connections so that they can do it virtually.
9304900	9312420	And if you watch some anime on Crunchyroll, Netflix, Funimation, high dive between I'd say
9313620	9323220	late 2000, late 2022, like 2021, you know, last 18 months or so, you probably couldn't tell.
9323220	9327540	You really couldn't tell that it was being done at home. But now that because restrictions have
9327620	9331940	been lifted and so forth and various companies owning certain companies, it's like,
9331940	9334660	well, we're not doing that remote anymore. You're going to have to come in.
9337140	9340980	The breaking news just won't stop. I didn't realize this happened until I think you or
9340980	9345220	somebody in chat said something about it. But, you know, we were talking about Kamiya and how
9345220	9349780	he basically was blocking everyone on Twitter. Twitter ended up restricting him. He deleted his
9349780	9356340	Twitter during tonight's show. As of two hours ago, he reactivated. So he's written a few tweets
9356340	9360820	since then. The first one he wrote says or translates to resurrection with a, you know,
9360820	9365780	little 8-bit graphic of a Phoenix. Then he writes, Good morning, everyone. It's still
9365780	9370180	Parasite Shimada mode. So he's basically saying, I'll still block you, bitch, is what I'm reading
9370180	9382020	out of that. Kamiya is very, yeah. Again, it's, yeah. He says, I've seen people repeatedly delete
9382020	9386420	and reactivate their accounts for some time. But after actually doing it, I feel like I
9386420	9389860	understand a little more. It's a sense of liberation, isn't it? And look at this,
9389860	9394580	the first reply, bah, maybe you should delete your account again or pay your voice actors.
9394580	9399700	Jennifer Hale got paid. That's what's happening. Everybody's taking
9399700	9403220	hell on his side and attacking without hearing the other side. This goes back to what I said
9403220	9411780	about the four sides. Yeah. I'm just seeing if there's anything else kind of, uh, don't
9411780	9417540	tweet me. I don't care. He should, he should turn off his replies. He should just turn that
9417540	9419780	off so people can actually message him. Maybe you should get someone on people
9419780	9423060	tweeting back at him. I don't know. I guess. I don't know. Just don't check your notifications,
9423060	9427540	dude. I don't know. Anyway, I'm not, again, and I want to make sure this is clear from the beginning
9427540	9431540	because I don't want people to be like, Rob Roberts said on OLR, he was taking Platinum Games
9431540	9439540	side. No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that there, I'm saying that what Helena is claiming
9439540	9445060	is not instantly the truth. And that I think she was pretty shady. And some of the things she said
9445060	9449700	that clue me into the fact that there is more going on. And again, there are more sides to
9449700	9455140	the story than what Helena is saying that I will own, you know, and some people are saying that
9455700	9464980	she did on this under duress, anger, and I get that. I, but I also feel if I put out a video
9464980	9472100	like that, just throwing everybody under the bus and casually spilling news of a spinoff game.
9472100	9477060	Yeah. I think like sometime late, I would do a follow up apologizing for my actions
9477060	9480100	and telling people that I was upset or something like that. I didn't see that.
9480900	9487700	No, I haven't seen that. And for, and I will add for some, and some people have said,
9488260	9493140	$4,000 is a lot of money for very little work. She should be thankful.
9493140	9495620	Okay. Voice acting is a lot of work.
9495620	9502580	Yes. Oh yeah. Again, that may be the base pay. And you may, I'm just saying you could be
9503700	9511060	the most pain in the ass voice actor out there, but regardless of how much of an asshole you are,
9511060	9515380	if you are, if you had that type of a demand for your voice and everything,
9515380	9519380	you're going to get more than the base money. I can tell you that right now.
9519780	9526100	Yeah. The other thing that I wanted to say, I don't remember if you said it or someone in
9526100	9530740	chat said it, but basically the fact that she's not going to be working with platinum games ever
9530740	9537380	again. I get, if she, if she broke NDA here. She burned those bridges.
9537380	9540500	She didn't just burn a bridge with platinum games. She's not going to work in, she's not going to
9540500	9545460	work in this industry again. You remember earlier how you said about voice actors are a bit of a
9545460	9550740	tight knit community. Yeah. I could tell you that. Is Jennifer fucking Hale the bridge you
9550740	9560420	want to burn right now, girl? I mean, she's such a sweet person. I mean, Jennifer is not,
9560420	9567140	not the sort of bitch. All right. Um, Rama, any quick final thoughts before we wrap up?
9567780	9573300	Oh, oh, oh, no, that, that, that's it. That's it. Have a good one. It's always great to hear from
9573300	9577220	you. And I encourage everyone to check out anime jam session, uh, where I, this story
9577220	9581300	will probably come up over there because it voice actor kind of crosses lines a little bit.
9582020	9587620	Actually, no. Uh, this week we're talking about the convention we just came back from,
9587620	9592900	which is why I'm wearing my, uh, sailor Venus soccer Jersey. Um, we just came back from a con
9592900	9599380	called AAC, another anime convention. Good, clever name. All right. Well,
9599380	9603540	we'll tune in for that on Tuesday. Uh, always appreciate hearing from you. Rama, uh, take care.
9603540	9606660	Have a great one. Okay. You too. You all take care of yourselves and each other. All right.
9608500	9612100	All right. Well, with that, we're going to wrap things up here. We're almost, uh,
9612100	9615140	well, two hour, 45 minutes, but still we've been on the air for a little bit. So
9615140	9619940	we're going to wrap up here and, uh, get on out of here for the night. Thank you all for being here,
9619940	9624100	especially after week break last week. Really appreciate that. Um, we're going to go around
9624100	9627940	and get our base final thoughts. I do want to thank you all for being here as I do every week.
9627940	9631620	Thank you for being here. If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, tell a friend or two about the
9631620	9635620	show. Help us spread the word. Um, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
9635620	9639700	but we need more voices here so we can get some voices on air and so forth. Uh,
9641060	9646500	everything goes a long way. Word of mouth reviews, five star reviews, shout outs, uh,
9646500	9650340	and all that good stuff. Raids. Uh, we really appreciate that. So thank you. Thank you. Thank
9650340	9656020	you. Um, let's, uh, let's wrap it on up. Um, you are streaming tonight, right? Dark soccer,
9656020	9661380	even with the voice issues, right? Okay. I, I am. Um, uh, I'll, I won't be talking much.
9661380	9666180	Um, but I plan on doing this in Debbie tonight. The Halloween event's still going on. I've got
9666180	9671780	all the stuff unlocked though. Oh, good, good. I still need to earn it. I would come play with you,
9671780	9676580	but I'm, I'm a day behind. I'm micromanaging my island 14. So that's probably where I'll be after
9676580	9682580	the show after publishing the show, which takes time too. So I can't, uh, intoxicated,
9682580	9688580	said he might play with me and Gwen. So reach out. Okay, cool. All right. Uh, any last thoughts
9688580	9695300	before we, uh, say goodnight? Oh, I need to go visit a sea witch about getting my voice back.
9696580	9702340	All right. Good luck with that. Bye. Later taters. I hope that sea witch is a drag queen
9702340	9711140	and not Melissa McCarthy. Just saying. All right. Bye. All right. Uh, Loki, your final thought
9711140	9719220	tonight? Um, hoping to get to play, um, return the monkey Island this week. Maybe a little bit,
9719220	9725780	at least. Yeah. Check that out. It'd be fun. Uh, my final thought is, um, being a cheap plug for
9725780	9730580	my personal stream, uh, at Rob Roberts here on Twitch. Uh, I will be playing no man's sky
9730580	9734980	tomorrow, uh, continuing on in Bobby Black Wolf mode. We're going to build some more base. We're
9734980	9738500	going to hopefully explore some things we haven't been able to get to before because the game can
9738500	9742660	move a lot faster now that you don't have to grind as much. So I'm really excited about that.
9742660	9748100	And, um, let's see. Uh, I also, on Wednesday, I'll probably be playing some overwatch too.
9748100	9752100	I'm going to try to co-stream that with husband. Um, if I can't do that on Wednesday, then, um,
9752100	9756580	you know, do something. So, uh, just a cheap plug for my personal channel. Thank you so much. Oh,
9756580	9762500	and also, also just on a like personal local note, um, I got to host that show last night with, um,
9762500	9765780	the screen queen score less the burlesque variety troop that I work with. And we had
9765780	9771620	the Boulay brothers, um, who host a Dracula as our headliners, um, and featured, and, um,
9771620	9776420	a lot of just kind words after the show that made me feel really good about my hosting ability and
9776420	9780500	like what I'm doing and so forth. So I just, I just want to say like, I really have felt that
9780500	9786020	love yesterday and on into it's, it's made me in a really good mood today, especially with, um, as,
