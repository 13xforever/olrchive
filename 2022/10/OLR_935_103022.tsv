0	12780	I hope you have broadband and aren't close to your download cap because you're going
12780	16860	to be downloading an entire quadruple layer Blu-ray XL disc's worth of content before
16860	20620	you can play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2-2. Start the game a few hours before you want
20620	24220	to play or plan on doing something else while you wait. The amount of data on the physical
24220	27980	disc? 72 megs. Why even manufacture the disc?
27980	31220	This is the First World Gamers Only Update. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts,
31220	34660	Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34660	36660	Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
36660	44460	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
44460	52680	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode
52680	62280	number 935 of our program for tonight, October the 30th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and
62280	67520	I am joined every week here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle,
67520	72960	games and stuff with my co-host, sadly not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers,
72960	77120	although I just saw her pop up into chat, but she's not joining us live tonight. You've
77120	80260	probably caught on the past couple of weeks. She's been dealing with some issues with her
80260	86900	voice. I'm not at liberty to say all the nuts and bolts of what's going on unless she wants to say
86900	91660	in chat, but I do know she is on doctor ordered rest. She'll be fine, but she's under doctor's
91660	98260	orders not to do too much talking. So doing a three hour podcast is a little bit much. However,
98260	102660	she will be joining us in a prerecorded Classic Game of the Week segment a little later in the
102660	108460	program. So in the meantime, though, of course, we are joined every week by Techmaster Loki. Hi,
108460	114820	Loki. Hey, how's it going? Good. How are you? Pretty good. Good. Of course, we do tape live
114820	121860	every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network. Nine o'clock Eastern,
121860	126980	six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And you can join us live or you can
126980	131580	barge on in the room as it appears. DarkSakura's just done throwing throwing off my scenes a
131580	138380	little bit. Hi. I just wanted to come in long enough to say hi to everybody and say I'm still
138380	144660	alive. Good. Yeah. The tone would have been much different if you weren't I'm not sure there would
144660	151860	have been a show tonight. Happy Halloween. Hi. Happy Halloween. It's a it's a mess over here. I
151860	158820	have to paint a gravestone at some point. Spooky. So did you want to give a little more insight
158820	167340	what's going on? Yeah. So I went to ear nose and throat specialist and I got to see my larynx. I
167340	175460	took a picture of it. I've got inflammation on my larynx and there is the flap that's like right
175460	185260	above it in the neck has got some damage to it, something that can heal up. So on Wednesday, I
185260	195100	speak to a speech therapist to see if I'm fine to come off the voice rest or if they need me to
195220	202020	continue or do reduce talking. So like I haven't even been doing my Dead by Daylight streams. I've
202020	213420	just been playing RPGs because I don't have to talk. So I I've been gesturing a lot. But right
213420	220460	now, this is about as good as my voice has sounded in the last couple of weeks. If I keep talking,
220820	226900	it will, of course, vanish into the abyss. Well, obviously, you probably just need to keep resting
226900	232540	it and hopefully everything goes all right. And, you know, we look forward to hearing how your
232540	237500	recovery keeps going. Yeah. And I'm not on cam because I'm totally in my pajamas. It's totally
237500	244380	fine. All right. Well, thank you for hopping in and saying hello. We'll hear from you through the
244380	248500	magic of prerecorded bits a little later in the show. Hey, I put a lot of work into that, so
248500	256140	people better like it. All right. All right. All right. Where was I? Loki, yes. When I was
256140	261420	introducing you, I was going to say, because, again, we do tape live, we have the video and
261420	267860	sometimes you play things behind you on video. And I actually got really excited when I saw what
267900	272220	game you had going behind you tonight. But for the sake of the podcast listeners who can't see the
272220	276580	game or for those watching live who don't know what it is, can you tell us what you have playing
276580	282660	behind you and why? I have Sim Ant playing behind me. And the reason for that is because they don't
282660	291940	have an Ant-Man video game because a new trailer came out for Quantumania. So, OK, nice, nice. No,
291940	297340	I loved Sim Ant. That was one of my favorite games for sure. Yeah, it wasn't one that I played, but
297340	304740	my friends had it. So, OK, nice. I also want to just kind of give a weird like FYI. So like some
304740	309380	of my OBS settings got all messed up because I made a transition with my personal streams, which
309380	316380	share with the same account to do some Spotify stuff that doesn't get cease and desisted on my
316380	320740	personal streams. It's nothing here for using for Orange Islands right now. But my point is a lot of my
320740	325340	sound settings got screwed up and I had to redo everything. So please let me know if the sound
325340	332060	seems off to you and I will try my best to fix it. Like for me, I hear Loki quiet. But when I see the
332060	337140	little meters that I'm looking, he's like probably at a level that's almost above where I'm at. So
337460	342060	I'm assuming everything is fine. Yeah. OK, Bobby Blackwell, he would say something if it was off and
342060	347700	he says sounds fine for me. So I'm going with it. So it's just the wonders of having to change
347700	355100	things every now and then. That's for sure. So. All right, let's see, I guess we'll get right into
355100	359140	our kickoff topic for tonight. Loki, did you want to tell us about what's going on? And I got to
359140	364940	say, there isn't like for being Halloween week and everything. There is a lot of news this week, I
364940	366580	gotta say in the gaming world. So
367020	371620	we're in the middle of the fourth, well, almost the end of the fourth quarter, actually. So there's
371620	373300	not going to be a whole ton.
373620	376740	Well, but well, I mean, there's some big game releases still coming because
376740	377180	November
377180	383220	I keep all the secrets for one more month. So then we can release them all for the Game Wars
383220	387340	Game Wars. I'll say there's always, you know, big announcements Game Wars. There's still some big
387340	391860	game releases coming. You know, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is a huge release that a lot of people
391860	398100	are looking forward to. God of War Ragnarok is on the horizon. Although apparently it leaked. So look
398100	404740	out internet for spoilers because they're out there. So that's on the horizon. And of course,
404740	409420	this week Bayonetta 3, a game that was in the news a lot the last couple weeks, maybe not for the
409420	414580	reasons it wanted to be. But, you know, I won't get into that now. But I know a lot of people are
414580	418740	looking forward to Bayonetta 3 and that's finally out, you know, so so we are getting into that
418740	422460	time of year where all the games are releasing. But because of that, we just don't have a lot of
422460	426860	news about what the future holds as far as you know, games go. There's a few things here and
426860	431380	there. But I just noticed generally when I was, you know, looking at the show world tonight, in a
431380	434980	way I was kind of like, you know what, if Dark Sakura has to miss a week, I don't know if we had
434980	439180	enough stories for all three of us. If she was here this week, I'd be we'd be really, really
439180	446060	pushing it. But if you all have any, you know, questions, comments, tonight is the night for
446060	452780	tangent trains. So by all means, shout them out in our Twitch channel over twitch.tv slash vog
452820	458700	network. So yeah, and I see Fanara is in chat as well. I'm glad to see you're doing better Fanara
459700	466420	who's also kind of resting up right now. Fifth Dream in chat says OMG, less than three weeks to
466420	474780	Pokemon SV. I'm gonna pee. Now the question is Fifth Dream. Are you getting Pokemon S or Pokemon
474780	476540	V? And of course, I mean, are you getting scarlet?
476540	478820	Are you going number one? Are you going number two?
481820	485340	Maybe that'll be Gen 10. Pokemon poo and Pokemon pee.
487740	493340	They can't say pee and poo. They'll have to like come up with names that are not quite that but you
493340	493660	know.
496580	501140	Fifth Dream says violet all the way. You're not really a Pokemon person though. Are you Loki?
503540	514540	Casual like the last one I played was let's play Pikachu and me is it was okay. I finished it. My
514540	521300	son played the last one. And we'll probably get this one too. I buy him a lot of like the switch
521300	530100	games. I got him hooked on Enter the Gungeon though. I'm a good father. So you know, I was
530100	536340	pleased to see him playing that. But yeah, it also picked up since it's not my game week, it's his
536980	542020	picked up the new Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope game. So he's been playing that too.
542020	548340	Nice. All right, cool. Cool. Let's see. Also looking in our chat room at some other comments
548340	554740	here. Mike Deaf says I still haven't decided what version to get. Yeah, I was asked about it this
554740	561140	weekend, which one I'm getting. And I'm like, I think I'm getting Scarlet because like 90% of
561140	566180	people I know are getting Violet because of the hot professor. And I do appreciate a hot professor,
566180	570420	but I also appreciate having the version that has the exclusives everyone else wants. So I can be
570420	576420	popular. So I might get Pokemon Scarlet just for that reason. And actually I like the ghost dog.
576420	583460	I like the prehistoric professor too, to be honest. So no, I don't know who it is when you
583460	588980	say ghost dog. We still don't know the final Evos of the base Pokemon in the game. There's still a
588980	595140	lot to look forward to. Let's see. Jaskren in chat in response to the question which Pokemon version
595140	600980	are you getting says Pokemon gun. Remember those memes when we had Pokemon sword and shield and we
600980	607700	never got Pokemon gun? Where where that's a great goal. Where is Pokemon gun? It's just there. It's
607700	613140	not going to be Pokemon gun. It'll be Pokemon trebuchet. And it's just not out yet. They have
613140	623620	to do that. Let's see. I also E3VL in chat says I wish they stuck with one version like Arceus.
623620	629540	And I honestly, truth, I'm almost more excited about a sequel for that game. Well,
630420	636420	let's let's have an honest moment. I need to go back and beat that game. I was really into it.
636420	641300	And then the moving happened. You might remember that was right around the time of the year I moved
641300	648260	and I completely derailed from all of that. Okay, so I need to go back and finish Arceus at some
648260	654260	point. Um, I was hoping there would be some DLC or something that would motivate that but nope,
654260	658980	we never did get that. So I'm almost more excited about a sequel to that game than anything else.
659700	664420	Um, Mike Defton chat says we were just used to double dipping by by now with
664420	669940	Nintendo. It's just an acceptable thing that we allow. Mike Defton chat says we
669940	674100	already had our chance of Pokemon gun with fifth gen being based on the United States.
674500	678580	Oh, flow blow, but he can make that joke. He's in Mexico. I know that so he can make fun of us for
678580	684500	sure. And well, we never said it had to be Pokemon handgun. It could be Pokemon potato gun. You know,
684500	691300	there's a lot of different types of guns. So it could be Pokemon blow gun. Water got water pistol
691300	697300	emoji could be a lot of things. So Bobby Blackwolf chat says I'm sadly not interested in Scarlet
697300	700900	Violet. I did get sword and finished it. That's interesting to me, Bobby, because
701540	708500	I the amount that I loved sword and shield will shield specifically, and finish that
708500	715380	is like part of my big motivator why I'm so in on Scarlet and violet. And I can tell you how this is
715380	719860	different. So we all know my friend Shane, who frequently guests on this show and what a Pokemon
719860	726660	maniac he is right. You all know this, right? Here's the thing. Usually, for most Pokemon games,
726660	730340	Shane is having to say, Are you gonna get it? Are you gonna get it to be so cool? You got to get it
730340	733380	which version are you gonna get? Well, you should get this one because I'm getting this one. We can
733380	737140	trade to do that. Like usually he's having to do all that with the releases. I'm like, Alright,
737140	742020	fine. Yes. Yes. I'll get the Pokemon game. Yes. This time, he kind of started that same thing.
742020	745860	Like, hey, are you gonna get Pokemon Gen nine? I'm like, Yeah, I'm definitely getting it. I
745860	748900	definitely want to get Pokemon Scarlet. And I definitely want to play the game to completion.
748900	755380	And he's just kind of like, Oh, great. Yeah, cool. It's kind of like, wait, wait, you mean,
755380	760420	I don't need to convince you this time? It's like, no, I actually enjoyed the last gen of
760420	766260	Pokemon that all of the longtime fans seem to hate. I enjoyed it so much that I don't need
766260	771300	convincing to get the next gen. I want it because it's it's apparently more of the same formula.
771300	778340	So that's that. Bobby Blackwolf says I've already played a Pokemon on Switch. So not really looking
778340	785220	for more of the same. Oh, but have you played Pokemon on Switch? Oh, led. Well, so I just need
785620	792740	what I need to do is I clearly not need to just send Shane Bobby Blackwolf phone number. That's
792740	801860	what I need to do. All right. Anyway, all right. We got derailed from the kickoff topic gaming
801860	806340	lobbyists. Like I said, tonight's the night to get derailed. So let's get into the real kickoff
806340	811140	topic tonight. Loki, you want to take this on? It's about prices, right? The price is right. The
811140	817140	price is wrong. It's it's about just kind of the inevitability at some point. And it's not even
817140	824740	necessarily a confirmation of prices going up. But basically, you know, with Sony raising the price
824740	832340	of I don't know if they necessarily they had to raise the price of their games. But they did,
832340	840660	because they they say it warranted $70, whatever. And of course, with like, say, the meta quest,
840740	846660	you know, to going up in price and stuff like that, stuff obviously is getting more expensive.
846660	856420	And according to Microsoft, you know, they spoke to was it Phil Spencer, who had said, you know,
856420	861860	we've held price on our console, we've held price on games and our subscriptions. I don't think
861860	866100	we'll be able to do that forever. I do think at some point, we'll have to raise some prices on
866100	874260	certain things, obviously, probably the subscriptions. But, I mean, it's not going to
874260	879060	happen this holiday, he says, obviously, I mean, obviously, and we're already in the holiday.
880020	885220	Makes perfect sense. So maybe next year, the prices will go up slightly. I mean, honestly,
885220	890260	if you think about it, though, like, when's the last time that they raised the cost of Game Pass
890260	895460	or Xbox Live or something like that? It's been a few years. And when you have like streaming
895460	899380	services, like, you know, Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, and stuff like that, I think raising the
899380	906260	prices, you know, at least once a year, I'm not surprised that this is going up. And it may even
906260	913300	be like a marginal thing. Will they raise the price of their games? Maybe if the market demand,
913300	917700	like if they're able to do that, like, I don't think a lot of game companies are doing it.
917700	925060	It's basically Activision. I don't know if EA is selling their games for $70. I hope not,
925060	931780	because it's not worth it. And Sony. I mean, those are the three that I can think of that are
931780	940500	selling their games for $70. And sometimes I think that's warranted. Like, I was some of the,
940500	945620	you know, first party Sony games, I could see how they could get away with that. Call of Duty
945620	951460	Modern Warfare 2, probably not. They're probably not worth $70. I don't see the value there.
951940	958660	But I guess we'll have to see. Definitely not Madden, but Madden was sold, I think,
958660	965220	for $70. That's certainly not worth it. So it's just a matter of what the consumers will pay for.
965220	967940	I mean, and I get it that they're saying that things are getting more expensive,
967940	973860	but I don't buy that. Like, I get it that you can charge more upfront for it, but you're also,
973860	978820	you know, charging on the back end with all these game passes and season passes and DLC and all
978820	983620	this stuff that's shoved in there. And a lot of times game mechanics built around just all
983620	987780	of this stuff in the first place. So even though, like, people like to make the stupid argument and
987780	994180	the wrong argument that, oh, games have never been cheaper. That's not true, because when I
994180	1001780	was buying a game back in 2005 for the Xbox 360, they didn't really have a ton of DLC or anything
1001780	1007060	like that available at the time. And certainly no game passes. So when you're getting a $60 game,
1007380	1012180	it was pretty much complete. You would have some bug fixes every now and then, but it certainly
1012180	1016580	wouldn't be this game comes out. Oh, hey, it's half finished. Let's have a roadmap of how we're
1016580	1021460	going to complete our game. It's like, well, you know, perhaps you should have finished it before
1021460	1027940	you sold it. I mean, that's how it used to be. So yes, things will probably get more expensive. But
1027940	1032660	at the same time, you know what, though, like one thing we are hearing from just the general public
1033620	1039060	is, yeah, everything's getting more expensive, but you know what's not going up my salary.
1039060	1044260	And so you can charge more for those games, but less people are going to buy it. And eventually,
1044260	1049460	what you're going to get is you're going to get it's going to move towards piracy is going to be
1049460	1053380	what's going to happen with all these different streaming services splitting off with their own
1053380	1058420	content. All these game companies, you know, charging more for their games when their games
1058420	1064580	come out and they're unfinished and just buggy as hell or just a mess. Yeah, people are going
1064580	1071300	to lose trust in you and they're just going to move to piracy. But I mean, do whatever you think
1071300	1075060	is good for your company. It just doesn't necessarily mean everybody's going to follow suit
1075060	1079140	with that. Well, and with multiplayer games being as popular as they are, that's going to be a very
1079140	1082420	hard thing to pirate. I mean, they always have been because the minute those things talk to the
1082420	1087140	servers, they're going to be able to suss out if it's a pirate version or not. So you know, which
1087140	1090660	is also why a lot of single player games were having multiplayer elements for some time and
1090660	1095220	still continue to. So by the way, I just want to point out Bobby Blackwell researched your EA
1095220	1102740	question and points out that FIFA 23 is $70 on Steam. I can guarantee that's not worth it. Not
1102740	1109460	worth it on Steam on Steam. Come on. Like, console, you might be able to get away with that on PC.
1109460	1115460	Are you serious? Like, I don't. Please don't buy the game for $70. It is not worth $70.
1116260	1123140	I guarantee you it's mostly recycled from last year. I, again, I'm sympathetic to the game.
1123140	1127940	I mean, like, I'm not saying I love the idea of the games going up to $70. But like, I understand
1127940	1132100	it, especially as we're sitting here going, you know, we just had a big debate on the show a
1132100	1137220	couple weeks ago and across the entire internet about our voice actors being paid enough, right?
1137220	1140820	We just went through that whole thing. And I realized that voice actors, you know, need to
1140820	1144100	make more money. And that money's got to come from somewhere. And I realized the people working and
1144100	1147940	making the games should have a good quality life. And that money's got to come from somewhere.
1147940	1154020	However, and I want to make this clear, I think the executive salaries are where a good chunk of
1154020	1158420	that ought to come from. I know it won't because that's just the way society works.
1158420	1163380	And I would totally make that argument for like, a lot of other games, maybe Sony might be a good
1163380	1168660	argument for that $70. And you know, whereas a lot of other games are really well polished when they
1168660	1173460	come out. And God of War Ragnarok is excellent game is going to be it's going to be hard to
1173460	1179060	argue that God of War Ragnarok is not worth $70. Like apparently, it's 50 solid hours of gameplay.
1179060	1185780	It's not a game that's going to be loaded up with, you know, cosmetic packs and all this BS. Like
1185780	1190020	God of War Ragnarok, I think is a good example of a game that can get away with charging $70. And
1190020	1195380	it's hard to complain about it. Yeah. Whereas EA is recycling the game that they had from last year,
1195380	1200580	adding minimal features to it and making billions of dollars off of micro transactions from their
1200580	1205220	FIFA Ultimate Team series. So don't give me Oh, they're there. I'm sure that all those people
1205220	1210100	that work for EA are probably starving and stuff like that, because they're not being paid enough.
1210100	1214020	But it's not because they don't have the money to do it. They have so much money that they don't
1214020	1218340	even know what to do with yet it can't. No amount of money they seem to throw at their game can't
1218340	1223060	make it good. So I don't know what the problem is there. They just probably don't care. Because
1223060	1228740	even if they just turn out the same crap as last year, they'll still make billions of dollars. So
1228820	1233860	the the the community has spoken, we will buy whatever crap you put out,
1233860	1237860	no matter for how much you charge for it. And we'll pay even more money on the back end,
1237860	1244020	because we got to have our FIFA Ultimate Team. We're, you know, I, we keep having this discussion
1244020	1249940	about the $70 game, the $70 game. And I think the reality is, there are so many ways to price a game
1249940	1255860	now in 2022. That like, I think the $70 game is sort of like, it's just this weird, like,
1255860	1261140	it's an option. But it's not like where all of the games are going. For example, Overwatch 2,
1261140	1267620	25 million people are playing Overwatch 2, that is technically a free game. But we all know it's
1267620	1271620	free with a giant asterisk if you want to get any of the cool stuff. Same thing with something like
1271620	1276980	Fortnite, which is one of the biggest games in the galaxy right now. Free with an asterisk. Pokemon Go
1276980	1282260	free with an asterisk. Like that's another way to price games. You can do monthly subscription.
1282260	1286500	It doesn't work for a lot of games, but Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft, say hello.
1286500	1290900	You can do, you know, the monthly subscription type of model. You can do a cheap, you can do a
1290900	1298340	hybrid. You can do a cheap as fuck base game that is then loaded with, you know, um, maybe not like
1298340	1304020	a ton, like, like just a lot of add-ons. Dead by Daylight is a great example of that. $20 game,
1304020	1309380	loaded with add-ons that are, that it's hard to say aren't, you know, that don't bring value.
1309380	1314100	They do, but there's, you know, just a lot. Fifth Dream in chat says, why food games are
1314100	1318100	technically free, but cost deliver in your soul to play as well. I believe you're talking about
1318100	1324420	Genshin Impact, which is free with an asterisk. So again, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just pointing out
1324420	1330740	$70 is like, we keep saying the, the industry says the industry is not all on a $70 game.
1330740	1335860	The reality is there are all sorts of pricing now in the industry and you have to decide,
1335940	1338180	is it worth it or is it not? How bad do you want to play the game?
1338180	1343060	That's my point is they make the, the argument that they're making that they say they justify
1343060	1350420	$70 is the quality of the game. So I better see the quality of that game when you're charging $70
1350420	1357860	for it. And the problem is it, the quality doesn't, it's not an upgrade from a $60 game.
1357860	1363780	The same with FIFA. Like when it was a $50 game and went to a $60 game,
1364420	1369540	it didn't increase in quality. It's the same stuff they've been pulling for years,
1369540	1375780	and it's just ridiculous. Sony can charge $70 for a game and it's easier to digest because
1376660	1380260	their quality is there. If you can see the quality in their work.
1380260	1386340	Quite honestly, if Final Fantasy 16 were $99 and 99 cents, I would probably still be buying it.
1386340	1390740	Well, I mean, that's fine, whatever you find value in, you know, with that. But I,
1390740	1398260	I think it's ridiculous, but you know, to that point though, you know, we look at the cost of
1398260	1403620	games, but that's not how necessarily we are digesting these games as well. So like, for
1403620	1409620	example, there's X-Box game pass. So, you know, that they're seeing right now is accounting for
1409620	1417860	15% of Microsoft's gaming revenue as of right now. I'm kind of surprised it's that low to be honest,
1418340	1424420	but then I think about the globe. I think about the globe and I wonder, is that 15% globally or
1424420	1429060	15% in the US? Because I bet it would be higher if you were to look at the US only, but if it's
1429060	1433780	globally, I sort of understand why there's a lot of countries around the world that probably are
1433780	1440180	still on physical media and not ready to have the network infrastructure to download a ton, a ton of
1440180	1445140	games through something like game pass. So that's kind of where the 15% makes more sense to me is on
1445140	1453860	a global level. And they're saying that it's not necessarily expected to increase either. They're
1454660	1460020	saying, I don't think it's going to get bigger than that. I think the overall revenue grows. So
1460020	1465700	15% of a bigger number, but we don't have this future where I think 50 to 70% of our revenue
1465700	1470500	comes from subscriptions. That's interesting. Well, maybe in a future where games are 70 and
1470500	1477780	$80, that might be a better deal because we don't have rental services anymore.
1477780	1482980	I haven't paid full price for a Microsoft game in five years because I've been on game pass
1482980	1488420	and I don't have to. But since we've been talking about price increase, price increase,
1488420	1492340	we talk about subscription prices going up and game pass is highly likely to go up.
1492980	1497620	Just a word of advice. Again, everybody's financial situation is different. So not everybody
1497620	1502180	may be in a position where they can do this, but I would just kind of plant the seed of,
1502180	1507380	if you can do this, I would highly advise you with Black Friday on the horizon.
1507380	1511380	We know we're going to see some deep discounts. We almost always around this time of year around
1511380	1518020	the holiday, see some type of discount on PlayStation network, as well as Xbox game pass.
1518020	1523700	If you can, I would load up on a year or even two, whatever you can afford and kind of like
1523700	1527380	lock in your rate because it's inevitable that those are going to go up and you'll probably
1527380	1531380	be able to get a lower rate because of Black Friday sales. There might be limitations and
1531380	1536100	weird things like that, but I would, and again, I'm talking about you dropping a couple hundred
1536100	1541300	dollars at once, which is certainly not feasible for everyone. If your situation calls for it
1541300	1545300	though, and you sort of know like I'm in it for the long haul with game pass, that's me.
1545300	1549220	I'm in it for the long haul with game pass. I know I will be on game pass for a very long time.
1549220	1554660	So I'm going to be looking around to probably load up on two or three years of game pass.
1555220	1561380	And I know a lot of you out there loaded up a lot of game pass. Bobby Black Wolf confirms
1561380	1567780	you can only front load up to three years of game pass, but you still can. And I think the
1567780	1574740	clock is running out for many of you that got that three years right out the gate. I think what 2023,
1574740	1580340	maybe 2024 for some of you, but I think 2023 is about where that clock is going to end for
1580420	1585700	many of you. Um, so you might want to load up on another three years. It just, it just, I mean,
1585700	1591300	again, it depends on your situation. Um, but I would just think about that as an option.
1591300	1595540	If you are a heavy game pass user or PlayStation network, to be quite honest,
1595540	1599140	I'm sure those prices will go up as well eventually. Maybe not as fast, but eventually
1601940	1606580	just something to think about. All right. Uh, let's take a moment to talk a little bit about
1606660	1610500	our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week on
1610500	1615860	X-Box or otherwise. So, uh, dark soccer is not joining us tonight. Uh, but I will start with
1615860	1622980	Loki then play Minecraft. It's I know shocking, shocking. Um, we live stream last night too.
1622980	1627780	I forgot to post up about that. I was in, um, I was just saying, I didn't see that.
1628740	1633220	It wasn't me streaming, but it was, it was a server made this streaming.
1633300	1641060	I was participating with that. Um, but yeah, I did a, a rather, it's a semi-large build
1641060	1647380	that will be in a next episode here. Hopefully very soon. Um, I was trying to get back down
1647380	1651060	the weekly. It's been two weeks already, but we're not going to make it four weeks. So
1652020	1656100	we'll get there. It's just, I have the, some editing stuff I got to do.
1656100	1659540	We said it's another big build like your, um, Mega Man.
1659540	1663220	Not that big. No, not as big as the octopus. That that that's ridiculous. No,
1663940	1668820	regular, regular large bills. Okay. Ridiculous. Like 200,000 partially ridiculous.
1669460	1673700	No, it looks nice. It's really cool. It's the centerpiece of one of the,
1674340	1680660	the robot masters areas. So it's, um, pretty cool looking. And it actually is from
1681220	1687780	Mega Man as well. It's from a game I haven't played. Um, it's a Mega Man zero two, but
1688340	1693540	it's a, it's a giant tree. All right. But yeah, that's, that's pretty much it.
1694580	1699140	Uh, let's see my gaming week. Um, yeah, I was a little busy with like show hosting this weekend
1699140	1703140	and stuff. So, um, I haven't had as much time for games. So I have been playing dead by daylight.
1703140	1707540	I streamed a little bit about that the other night, um, because they are doing a big, uh,
1707540	1711460	blood point push in the game right now. So just, you know, uh, I've been working on
1711460	1717700	prestiging more survivors. So I prestiged both Kate and somebody else this last week. Was it
1717700	1722020	Nia? No, I think it was somebody else, but yeah, I prestiged two more survivors this last week.
1722020	1726580	Uh, Oh, Elodie, I think was one of them that I prestiged. So, um, I'm, I'm just working on trying
1726580	1731060	to prestige all the survivors. Uh, maybe I'll play killer at some point, but the game has been in
1731060	1734500	this weird place where the survivors have been getting all the bonuses now in the shorter queue
1734500	1739780	times. Whereas six months ago, it was, uh, very different. So, uh, I've been working on that,
1739780	1745060	uh, still playing Final Fantasy 14. I still am obsessed with the farming sim mode in that game,
1745060	1749780	the island sanctuary. I now have earned every single cosmetic that you can get right now in
1749780	1755540	the island sanctuary. And so what I'm doing, I am just stockpiling the currency to just instantly
1755540	1759860	buy whatever's next. When they put out the new content, I'm hoping they don't outsmart me and
1759860	1763940	make it a different currency. I'm really frightened. They're going to do that so that I save up like
1763940	1768820	200,000 of the island calories and then I can't even use them or I can always buy materia or
1768820	1773300	something with them, but we'll see. So that's going on. Um, SSG100 Matt in chat says gaming
1773300	1777620	week Overwatch 2 with a new Junkenstein event going on. I actually did check that out as well.
1777620	1783460	I, I haven't played a lot of Overwatch 2, but I did the new Junkenstein event just once just to,
1783460	1787620	you know, say that I did it and pick up the easy cosmetics and whatever battle pass points,
1787620	1792020	whatever you, I'm thinking my battle pass like level 11. I've barely played any Overwatch, but
1792340	1797300	I've done, I've done a little bit. Yeah. I also noticed, uh, that the skill like it,
1797300	1802100	this one is harder than the last one was, uh, the, the original event that's, you know,
1802100	1805060	several years old at this point, you can still play the original if you want to,
1805060	1808580	that's still in the game. But yeah, the new one was harder because you had to, you know,
1808580	1813940	go exploring and it's not always obvious where you need to go is, is a little more challenging. So,
1813940	1819940	um, I've also been playing that. Um, but otherwise I didn't really dabble in anything new this week,
1819940	1826020	to be honest. Um, just kind of the old reliables, uh, until, uh, probably, probably it'll stay that
1826020	1830340	way until maybe Pokemon Scarlet and violet. I do kind of want to pick up bandana three. I just,
1830340	1835700	I don't know if I have the time, but my, my hosting and weekend stuff clears up significantly next
1835700	1841860	month. So, um, I'll have a little more time for games at that point. Um, I, we're not going to be
1841860	1845780	here on OLR. At least I won't be, I, I don't know if Loki at our cyber want to do something, but I
1845780	1850180	won't be here in two weeks, uh, veterans day weekend because I'll be out on vacation and kind
1850180	1857300	of like after that point, I get freed up a lot. So, um, I'll have more time to sink into catching
1857300	1865460	up on backlog games and the games that come out, uh, this, this, uh, over the next, uh, few weeks.
1865460	1869700	And so the holiday releases, uh, quest buster and chat says, I'm having a lot of fun with bandana
1869700	1874260	three. Uh, me, she says, I'm hoping to get two copies of bandana three for shits and giggles,
1874260	1880420	digital and physical, uh, Jaskren and chat says gaming week, mass effect. One first time play
1880420	1885060	through all on the steam deck. Uh, yeah, that's cool. I'm assuming that's like the legendary
1885060	1889380	edition. Maybe that's neat. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says I'm considering getting bandana three
1889380	1894180	because I was told you don't really have to have played two to understand it. I played one when it
1894180	1898260	originally came out, but it's been a while. I am also under that understanding that number three,
1898260	1903700	you don't need to know the first two games that well to understand. So you don't, you don't need
1903700	1909060	a deep understanding of those. So that's pretty cool. So we'll see. Oh yeah. No man's sky. I have
1909060	1912740	been dabbling in that game a little bit as well. I see you all know that I play that game way too
1912740	1919620	much, but it's, I love the new relaxed modes. I really do. So good times. All right. Let's get
1919620	1925220	into some more gaming news and what's going on throughout the industry. What little there is a
1925220	1931140	lot of updates on other stories, but, uh, Loki, what do you have for us? It's hard to keep track
1931140	1936580	of all these different lawsuits, but this is going hearkening back to the first lawsuit for
1936580	1943300	Activision Blizzard regarding the poor treatment of their employees. Um, so this is from the
1943300	1948820	California civil rights department, which was previously known as the California department
1948820	1955860	of fair employment and housing. Um, so they're basically, uh, Activision is trying to get the
1955860	1963140	case thrown out again, basically saying that because of these, the cases, because of this
1963140	1973620	case, they have suffered, um, bad PR, I guess it is, it is, um, is tarnished their reputation,
1974740	1983620	uh, of a company that's about to get acquired. I'm sorry that your reputation is tarnished because
1983620	1989380	people found out that you harassed your employees. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, but that's what they're trying
1989380	1996660	to make the argument. I don't think, Oh, obviously it's, it's not succeeding, but yep. So Activision
1996660	2005060	was like the truth hurts. And for that reason, we shouldn't be sued. Uh, but yeah, so the case
2005060	2012020	is still moving ahead. It is supposed to take place, um, into 2023, I think at some point.
2012980	2018500	All right. That's going to be interesting to see how that's timed with the merger. If the merger
2018500	2022020	is allowed to go through, a lot of people think that Europe is going to shut down that merger and
2022020	2026660	it may not actually happen. That could be very interesting. So be interesting. I would, I would
2026660	2030980	be curious if Microsoft might try to buy a part of Activision Blizzard, if that gets stopped,
2030980	2036420	like Microsoft's like, we'll just take Blizzard. Thanks. Right. It's kind of weird though. Like I
2036420	2041860	especially find it funny when we hear about Sony making the argument that, Oh, they'll have an
2042180	2049060	unfair advantage with exclusives. It's like, dude, you do the same thing. Shut the hell up.
2049060	2053940	Like, can you, this is literally your game plan. Well, they're doing it too. Now it's not fair.
2055220	2062420	We want to do it first. I don't know. Corporations got to hate him.
2064820	2070100	All right. Uh, well earlier in the show I had brought up Genshin impact. Um, this is,
2070100	2073060	I tried Genshin impact. I gotta be honest. I couldn't get into it,
2073060	2078740	but I know a lot of people love this game. They love Genshin impact and they play the
2078740	2083460	shit out of this game. Uh, unfortunately Genshin impact has had a bit of a data breach,
2083460	2090340	uh, that has happened. Um, and so, uh, people's, uh, information could be at risk. So I hope you
2090340	2096500	all are changing your passwords. That's for sure. Uh, let's see. I want to mention, uh,
2096500	2102740	what is happening here. Unfortunately, the first thing I tried to go to the site wouldn't work.
2102740	2108420	So I'm trying to quickly get into an alternate site that talks about what's happening here.
2109140	2118980	Um, all right. Sorry. All earlier this week, uh, Genshin impact, uh, HoYo verse had a data breach
2118980	2123380	and big batches of information were shared online to talk about the details of new characters,
2123380	2130580	quests, and events from 3.3 until 3.8. Uh, there were DMCA strike to poach that came out of the
2130580	2135940	data breach. Uh, so, uh, you know, you never know what's going to change there. Uh, although, uh,
2135940	2140660	one of the leakers on Twitter had a change of heart saying after further consideration with
2140660	2145460	friends, I decided to remove all my tweets from today just to be safe to make it clear.
2145460	2149620	I do not condone what other methods in which the data was obtained and I was not involved in
2149620	2156180	obtaining nor distributing the original data. Um, uh, apparently, uh, 36 weeks of content,
2156180	2161300	uh, that is coming out for the game. We're all impacted by the breach and this information.
2161300	2166100	Um, so to correct something I said a moment ago, I apologize, but no, uh, usernames and passwords
2166100	2171860	have been put at risk yet, but I would say the logic says if they got in there and looked at
2171860	2176900	some of this stuff, they probably got access to other stuff too. That's just not being acknowledged
2176900	2181940	yet. So I would say, you know what, change your passwords anyway. I had a good habit.
2181940	2188260	It's a good thing to do. And then quest buster says that, uh, it was, uh, some QA and employee
2188260	2194100	info that was included in that as well. What was taken out from that. So, um, Bobby Blackwolf does
2194100	2198740	say I never gave a username and password to them. It was attached to my PSN account. So hopefully
2198740	2202980	for most people that did a type of link thing, it would be okay, but I'm sure there are people that
2203060	2208900	have an account directly through the company as well. Um, possibly playing on PC or something. So
2208900	2213220	it would be good to stay on top of that information. Uh, it is interesting though
2213220	2218740	that most like web browsers and stuff will now tell you if a password was in a data leak. Have
2218740	2222820	you, have you seen this? And like, I don't, I think Chrome does it. And I think, uh, some of
2222820	2226740	the others do too, maybe edge, but like when you try to use a password on a website, if it's
2226740	2231620	something that was in a data breach, it actually pops up and says this password was found in a data
2231620	2236180	breach. You shouldn't use it. So it's interesting that it compares all that right out the gate.
2236180	2240020	Try it, try it next time you sign up for a website, just put your password in as password,
2240020	2244660	don't save it, but just put, put in something silly, uh, and, and see how the alert comes up.
2244660	2249380	Bobby Blackwolf says Firefox does it too. I think that's very interesting how, um, they will help
2249380	2255940	people, uh, not pick, uh, bad passwords in that regard. So remember use, use mixed words,
2256660	2262820	mixed case, mixed letters, jumbles, punctuation numbers, uh, all that goes a long way. Don't use
2262820	2267460	the name of pets, or if you are going to use the name of the pet, combine it with other things that
2267460	2275860	don't make sense. Do your favorite pet, favorite food, you know, favorite cousin with, uh, some
2275860	2280580	random capitalization and some numbers of significance to you. Uh, or Jaskren in chat
2280580	2285060	says use a password manager. Absolutely. Uh, then you only have to remember one password,
2285060	2290100	which is still sometimes a challenge for me. That's for sure. The password managers, man,
2290100	2294820	they're, they're sure helping us. Every website now is like, you have to have a minimum of eight
2294820	2298500	characters to this website. For this website, you have to have a minimum of eight, but no more than
2298500	2303620	20, but you have to have at least one that's a punctuation and you can use numbers, but you can't
2303620	2309460	use the number three. It's like every website has their own wild rules to them. So, uh, yeah,
2309460	2314660	password managers are great. That's for sure. All right, moving on. Uh, this is very interesting
2314660	2321140	about where the industry is headed, right? Um, yeah, well, it it's, I don't know if it's
2321140	2327540	unexpected because we've seen this before with different games having partial or parts of their
2327540	2332260	game that, well, it's kind of actually the opposite. So you may remember a while back,
2332260	2338180	we had the whole issue where DLC was on the disc and people were upset about that. Well, what if
2338180	2344260	the DLC isn't on the disc and the game isn't on the disc as well? The disc is just, I guess the
2344420	2353540	memento, a memento with a key to go download the game. Um, but yes. Yes. Um, so modern warfare two,
2354260	2361220	uh, the Blu-ray disc that they have contained 72 megs of data. That's like enough to fit on AC
2361220	2368740	ROM. Um, not even on a Blu-ray. I don't know why they pressed it onto a Blu-ray disc, but they did.
2368740	2374020	And it allows it's basically forcing players to connect to the internet and download a hundred
2374020	2379700	plus gigabytes of data. So that's great. So like, even though you didn't want to buy the
2379700	2385540	game digitally because, Hey, I have bandwidth caps and I can't really do that. Activision says,
2385540	2391140	you know what? We don't care what you like. You paid $70 for a game. So you get to pay
2391140	2397380	those overdraft fees or whatever for going over your bandwidth caps. It's it's the Activision gift
2397380	2403700	that keeps on giving. And so you're going to have to download all of that data for the game. Um,
2404580	2411940	I guess to protect from spoilers or something. Well, I mean the God award team like literally
2411940	2416340	tweeted earlier. So what are the reps literally tweeted earlier today? I kind of wish we'd gone
2416340	2422020	this route because now a retailer leaked their game two weeks early and all of the spoilers
2422020	2427460	are out there now. That's a problem though. And I could definitely speak to this. Uh,
2427460	2431940	that's a problem because you ship your stuff too early to mass market retailers
2431940	2436020	is the problem. And, and the, all the time people always are going to get accused like
2436020	2442740	the small mom and pop shops of breaking street dates to, um, get a competitive advantage over
2442740	2448980	their competitors. And they do. But the thing is though, is those mom and pop stores aren't buying
2448980	2455060	direct from Activision. They are buying from a distributor who doesn't even get the copies of
2455060	2461220	the game until like the week of, and barely gets them to them by street date. So it's leaking two
2461220	2468180	weeks early. It's because the dumb assholes at Activision decided to ship the game that early.
2468180	2474100	So you have yourself to blame, or in this case it would be Sony. You have yourself to blame
2474660	2480100	for shipping it that early. That's your own damn fault. Sorry, but it is if you didn't send out
2480100	2489460	the door, can't get leaked. Um, but in this case, so this is absolutely stupid. Once again, $70 game
2489460	2494980	and you're making me download the whole game. Why, why even make a physical version of it?
2494980	2498500	What is the point? This sucks for game preservation as well, because
2499140	2505060	when Activision inevitably takes down the server, how am I going to get my game? You know, like it
2505060	2510500	in the future, it's just awful. Um, Bobby, Bobby lack of in chat does have a good point about the,
2510500	2514340	because you had said, you know, why even bother with a Blu-ray when it's the size can fit on a
2514340	2519220	CD. Uh, they press it that way because Xbox and PS five can't play games off a DVD or CD,
2519220	2522420	which makes sense. I mean, they might be able to read them to play the music or the movie,
2522420	2527140	but they're not trained to boot games off of them. I get that. I mean, basically,
2527700	2534020	but why, like, I would just put card in the box at this point. Like what's the point? Like, I mean,
2534020	2540900	seriously that like, what's the point anyways, for this, I guess. So I don't even know.
2540900	2549700	It's just dumb. Yeah. I, I, I, you know, with a game like call of duty specifically,
2550340	2554980	I know that a big chunk of that is multiplayer and you're going to have to be online for
2554980	2562660	multiplayer anyway. So I'm kind of like, I'm not, I'm not like surprised that like, you have to be
2562660	2566020	online to download all the patches and all the things like that. And that, you know, you're not
2566020	2570820	going to get a lot of play off the disc. Although I know, yes, there is a single player campaign to
2570820	2576180	as well. I know, but I know a lot of people play a multiplayer, but I also, you know, I'm also
2576180	2580580	spoiled now with lack of bandwidth caps. And that's something that was strongly something
2580580	2585220	that affected me, you know, six months ago. And this would tick me off because a big reason why
2585220	2590900	I would buy things physically was because I don't want to download like 80 gigabytes. And that's
2590900	2596500	what pissed me off about legendary edition. Or just like even, even just think about your
2596500	2600020	customer. I mean, obviously they're not thinking about the customer. They could, they see them as a
2600020	2604340	wallet, so it doesn't matter. They don't think of them as people, but like, aside from that,
2604980	2610820	so not only am I going to now have to like, say I bought this day one or whatever, midnight launch
2610820	2616740	or whatever, even if they do that anymore, I'm going to go home and I can't play the game because
2616740	2625220	I have to download 100 gigabytes for this. And, and the latest patch that they have, it's reported,
2625220	2631460	it's over 150 gigabytes large when you include the campaign and multiplayer. So not only am I
2631460	2635380	going to download the game, but then if it patches again, I'm gonna have to download another hundred,
2635380	2640660	some gigs. Do they not know the reality that we live in? People have bandwidth caps. It's,
2640660	2647460	we don't live in a gigabit world where everybody has lightning fast, you know, fiber internet and
2647460	2651620	can just download whatever because they have unlimited data caps. If we lived in that world,
2651700	2656740	this would be no problem whatsoever, but we don't live in that world. And it doesn't work. What
2656740	2662980	about here's a weird idea. What about somebody that doesn't have a great internet connection?
2662980	2667380	So they're downloading it two megabits per second, or they're downloading it at, you know,
2668100	2673540	DSL speeds or something like that. Well, I hope you can, I guess I'll play it next weekend when
2673540	2678020	it's done downloading. I mean, like a lot of military guys and gals like to play this game.
2678020	2682340	And, uh, the internet connection is usually pretty shitty, uh, overseas. So.
2683220	2691860	It is just such, it's so cell science. Like what, what costs can we cut so that we make more money?
2691860	2696980	So the shareholders make more money is all that they, that's all they look at. They don't care
2696980	2703220	about the quality of the game. It's just about how much money we can make. Um, Bobby was some
2703220	2708180	more points in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And, you know, I do see this side
2708180	2713380	of this, um, saying the disc is the key to unlock the game as well. It needs to be in the console.
2713380	2717700	You can still resell the disc and you won't be able to play it without the disc. This means the
2717700	2722180	resale market is still available for this game and the code, et cetera. It doesn't work that way. It
2722180	2728500	does. And I will say to that, you know, comments credit, it does put aside one of my big problems
2728500	2732980	with, you know, buying digital versus buying physical is that when you buy a game digital,
2732980	2737540	you can't resell it. It has no equity. It doesn't have any type of collectible value,
2737540	2742100	essentially, unless you're into digital collectibles, which, you know, um, I would
2742100	2747140	say the mass market, when you look at things like NFTs is rejecting, um, you know, digital
2747140	2753940	collectibles. So we've seen many stories about how, uh, the game industry specifically, they've
2753940	2759620	been trying to make NFTs the next big thing and the, the, the gamers are rejecting it, which I
2759620	2764260	appreciate and so forth. But my point is, is that, you know, because I like having those
2764260	2770180	physical collectibles, at least as much as this method sucks, it does still play into the old
2770180	2776260	system of the disc is the game and you can resell that and it has value, blah, blah, blah, blah,
2776260	2780020	you know? So that part of it I get, but if I had a bandwidth cap, I'd be pissed.
2780660	2786820	Yeah, but it's not $70 anymore because now you're caught, you're charging me the electricity to
2786820	2792420	download the thing. You're charging me the bandwidth I have, so possibly exceeding it.
2792420	2799220	You are costing me more time because I anticipated to be able to play this after,
2799220	2805460	you know, obviously downloading an update patch, which is fine. You know, it's acceptable at this
2805460	2811380	point. So it's, it's a lot more than $70 at this point. And then they're probably going to shove
2811380	2818420	microtransactions and DLC and battle passes and all that other crap down your throat.
2819460	2825860	So like, I don't feel bad when they say, Oh, we're charging $70 for our game and people don't want
2825860	2829620	to buy it. I mean, people are still going to buy it because there are people that will just buy
2830420	2836340	Call of Duty every year. It doesn't matter what they put out. But whatever. I mean, it's
2838340	2845220	people, what I think it's upsetting about this is that people probably who are buying this don't
2845220	2849060	know this until they've already bought it. It's not like something that they disclose like, Hey,
2850260	2855940	you're gonna have to download. Well, it may be in tiny ass fucking print on the back of the box.
2856580	2860820	requires internet, will you and that requires internet connection to download full game or
2860820	2863300	something like that. It'll be in tiny ass fucking print on the back of the box.
2865060	2867940	I think they should at least put like the campaign on there or something like that.
2867940	2871700	They've done that in the past where the multiplayer is, you know,
2871700	2876820	later on, because the servers will come online later or something like that you download it
2876820	2883540	later. And I think that's somewhat acceptable, because then at least I'm not having to spend
2883540	2888660	as much of my data as I would if I was to buy digitally. But once again, it's like,
2890580	2895140	why buy it physically? And then I get it. Yeah, you can resell it later on. But do really people
2895140	2902660	hassle with that. I don't know if a lot of people do anymore. Like, it's trading is not worth it.
2902660	2909860	And to sell it online. Sure, you can do it. But is a hassle. So I don't know. I don't think I don't
2909860	2916900	know if the use market is really what it used to be. But well, Activision sucks. What are you
2916900	2924020	gonna do? Bobby says the PS five version has requires content download in small print on the
2924020	2930660	bottom of the front of the box. So it's there, but it's, it's easily missable. Yeah, but most
2930660	2935460	people don't mean that it's like, like content download, you may think, oh, that that means a
2935460	2939860	part of the game. It doesn't mean the whole game. Like, I don't know. It's not. It's not
2939860	2945380	specifically say, you will have to download this whole game. Like, and that's, I don't know,
2945380	2949540	whatever. Who cares? I'm not the target demographic for this at the moment. So it's fine.
2950260	2955620	All right. Well, let's move on and talk about orange right in chat says it should be as obvious
2955620	2960100	as those switch games that don't even have the game card in it. Well, speaking of the switch,
2960900	2969220	you can now use those controllers on various Apple devices. There was an update that will now use
2969220	2973060	allow the Apple devices to use the classic controllers from the Nintendo switch.
2973060	2978900	So you can use the N 64 classic controller, you can use that Sega Mega Drive Genesis classic
2978900	2982900	controller, you can use the Super Nintendo classic controller, the NES classic controller,
2982900	2989860	and you can use them with any device that runs either Mac OS 13, iOS 16, TV OS 16. So you know,
2989860	2996340	pretty much, you know, any Apple device in the last couple years, the joy cons and switch pro
2996340	3001940	controller that was already there. This is something for those, you know, special unique
3001940	3008020	controllers, but also pretty cool. Like, you know, I know people have, you know, snuck in some
3008020	3014100	emulation sometimes onto the Apple system. So those controllers can come in handy if you're
3014100	3019780	managed to grab some of those things before they got pulled. Or, you know, even with retro inspired
3020420	3025700	games, having these classic controllers can be a lot of fun, that's for sure. Also worth pointing
3025700	3029620	out, you can also if you don't, if you don't want to use Nintendo controllers, you can still use
3029620	3034420	Xbox series controllers, the dual sense, you can use a dual shock, you can go back and use an Xbox
3034420	3040260	one controller. There are a lot of other devices that will work with the Apple devices. But
3040260	3048820	interestingly enough, still no official Apple joystick. They tout a lot of compatibility with
3048820	3053860	third party devices, but never an official one, which is just interesting. Unless I guess you
3053860	3059060	count maybe the remote for the TV, but I don't really count that. Just it's always interesting
3059060	3064980	to me how for whatever reason, they haven't really looked behind that rock. I'm just surprised
3064980	3069940	because it would be very easy to make a shell that the phone could snap into and it would be a lot
3069940	3074900	like a switch. But maybe because there's varying sizes of phones, I don't know. But I would think
3074900	3080420	you could have a stretchy thing. But I guess it's whatever they don't want to do it. So
3082580	3088660	but a lot of people own a Nintendo switch or one of those many other devices I just named that it
3088660	3094020	also works with. So that is something you can do. Bobby Blackwell also points out anything's
3094020	3101140	possible with 3d printers. It's true. It's true. All right. Let's move on. We have some more
3101140	3108740	stories. Let's get to Loki. Yeah, so there's this game called the stores closed, which is an SCP
3111060	3116660	infinite store survival game. So basically, it's this big procedurally generated
3117300	3126660	furniture store. The problem is that the outside of the store has yellow lettering against a solid
3126660	3134580	blue store. And so IKEA believes it looks like it looks too much like IKEA. And clearly, I mean,
3135940	3140020	I think it's supposed to be slightly inspired by IKEA, but it's not supposed to be IKEA.
3140020	3145300	It's more of like kind of the joke where you can wander through IKEA and kind of get lost a little
3145300	3149940	bit, because they're really big and winding stores. True. So I think that's where they've
3149940	3155060	kind of taken the inspiration from it. But the game itself looks pretty cool. You actually are
3155060	3160260	like trapped inside the store and you have to avoid the staff who turn into giant monsters at
3160260	3168820	night. And then you build of bases or forts out of the furniture. Which I love that. It's like
3168820	3175220	it's got like, yeah, you forever end up having to live in a 310 square foot space, like the
3175860	3181060	models in IKEA, you know, show you how here's how to live within 400 square feet or whatever,
3181060	3186340	you know, you know, yeah, it's like that. But so yeah, they're basically there's a lawyer from
3186340	3194260	IKEA had contacted them saying that they need to stop infringing on IKEA stores. They said that
3194980	3199220	our client has learned that you're developing a video game the store is closed, which uses
3199220	3204180	without our clients authorization indica associated with the famous IKEA stores.
3204820	3209860	So blue and yellow, I guess the blue the game uses a blue and yellow sign with a
3209860	3216820	Scandinavian name on the outside or on the store on a blue box like building yellow vertical
3216820	3222180	stripes shirts identical to those worn by IKEA personnel. A great path on the floor furniture
3222180	3226260	looks like IKEA furniture into which is funny though because the developers like I just bought
3226260	3234260	a I just bought a cheap furniture pack on like the unity assets store for this. This is all
3234900	3241300	foregoing or they're basically saying all foregoing immediate suggests that the game
3241300	3248180	takes place in an IKEA store. Like unfortunately, he's probably gonna have to change the way like
3248820	3253700	the outside of the store looks which is weird because you don't ever see it. It's only in the
3253700	3261380	menu like the start menu. But I mean, obviously, he's not gonna fight it. You know, $25 billion.
3262180	3267140	Yeah, I but I think IKEA is doing a pretty shitty thing here. You know, I also, you know,
3267140	3270900	somebody I already know somebody's type in the comment, they have to chase their trademarks,
3270900	3277060	or they they might. He's not calling it. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm with pod culture. It doesn't just
3277060	3282740	fall under parody. Like, wouldn't you can't you do something that's similar, but it's also
3282740	3288100	distinctly different. And like, he didn't call it IKEA. He called it something else. And he didn't
3288100	3292420	lift the actual brand names. He's calling them something else. And I think it's very obvious
3292420	3297700	when you look at the fact like it's a horror game, that any reasonable person would know that like,
3297700	3304020	when you actually go to IKEA, you're not going to be having a horror experience. Like I in Dark
3304020	3311460	Saga is still in China. It falls under parody. Yeah. And brings up when the in the 90s. And
3311460	3317220	Marvel Comics, McDonald's was called Mac food. Yeah, and pop culture says they should embrace
3317220	3323060	it instead run with it. I mean, they can, but I don't know because you know what they're doing
3323060	3327700	here. I don't know if I would call it Streisand effect. I don't think it's quite that. But I would
3327700	3332500	say this game now is getting all of this additional media coverage that it would not have gotten if
3332500	3336820	IKEA didn't send this letter. I'm not sure that's exactly Streisand effect. But it's it's it's in
3336820	3342260	the same family. And it's in the he could probably just change outside of that store to make it look
3342260	3346580	slightly different. So it doesn't it's not like IKEA. It doesn't really matter. But
3347220	3355220	but I think it's weird Al does an album cover that is really similar to, you know, an established
3355220	3359700	like, you know, what the what was his album that how the Michael Jackson parodies on it that looked
3359700	3364580	just like the bad album? Like, come on. He does this all the time with his album covers. And it's
3364580	3370740	like, you know, people understand. It's, it's a joke. It's a parody. Like a reasonable person
3370740	3374900	understands the difference. That's true. Dark soccer does say he had a good relationship with
3374900	3378900	Michael Jackson. That's true. I'd heard that Michael Jackson, like allowed him to use the same
3378900	3386420	set, even. So he did fair, fair, but come on. It's still that even if he didn't, if he,
3387620	3391860	you know, we all know that Coolio had a problem with it. And there was really nothing that could
3391860	3397700	be done. Yes, they made amends and so forth. Yes, that all got, you know, resolved later on,
3397700	3403700	but it was an issue at first, right? So it's just, you know, I just I don't understand why
3403700	3410740	he can't just say suck it like it's parody. This falls and plus, if I isn't this being I believe
3410740	3418340	the lawyer. So the company is in Sweden. The lawyer is in New York, but the game makers in
3418340	3427300	Europe. So how are you gonna how are you gonna fight that? I don't think you do. Yeah. So I just
3428580	3432740	I think these lawyers did this game maker a favor at the end of the day, to be quite honest.
3433860	3438500	Yeah, we'll see. I mean, it's definitely gotten a lot more publication than it would have. But I
3438500	3443300	hope the creator like I guess if they feel a need to change the color, make it you know what,
3443300	3447460	honestly, make it a yellow store with blue lettering. And then that's it. Don't change
3447460	3453780	anything else. Don't change anything else. And just say it's very, God, shut up. All right.
3453780	3461140	Let's talk about Digital Eclipse, which is a company that has made a lot of great
3461140	3464180	retro kind of revival sorts of games. You know, they've published a lot of
3464980	3470180	I want to say they did a lot of the Castlevania stuff recently with Konami and so forth. They've
3470180	3475620	been doing, you know, retro packages and stuff like that on modern consoles for a long time.
3475620	3479300	Most recently, they did the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Cowabunga collection.
3479940	3487460	They put out a new game for Halloween. But it's actually not a classic game. This is a new game
3487460	3493780	that's retro inspired. So it's a game called Candy Creeps. And you can play it with one or two
3493780	3500820	players. And it's a retro arcade like performer, platformer, excuse me, where you take you go out
3500820	3507220	against the pump king who stole candy. Oh, no. And you have to do like Mario Brothers, the original,
3507780	3512420	like jumping on, like, you know, stomping heads and things like that. So apparently this is the
3512420	3517620	first in what Digital Eclipse is going to do as an arcade line. And they're just calling it
3517620	3523860	New Games Inspired by Classic 80s Arcade Vibes. So that's kind of neat. If you want to get it,
3523860	3532260	it will cost you $4.99 US dollars on itch.io. Or if you sign up for the Digital Eclipse
3532260	3537140	mailing list by tomorrow, Halloween, which might actually be today for many of you listening on
3537140	3541620	the podcast, you can get it for free. So you can sign up for the Digital Eclipse mailing
3541620	3545700	list by doing that. The URL, unfortunately, is a little long. So you'll probably have to Google
3545700	3550420	it because I can't read it out here to you. But that is the way you can get it free or just check
3550420	3556020	it out on itch.io if you want as well. So yeah, I think that's, that's, hey, I'm all about a free
3556020	3563780	game. And I like a retro game, right? So it all works. So, well, speaking of retro games,
3563780	3567460	I think this is a good opportunity to get into our next segment.
3578180	3583700	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
3583700	3588580	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
3597300	3605140	Hello and welcome to the classic game of the week. This game, appropriately, is Halloween
3605140	3612260	for the Atari 2600. It was developed by Micrographic Image, published by Wizard
3612260	3621540	Video, designed by Tim Martin and Robert Barber. It was released on the Atari 2600 in October 1983.
3622340	3632500	And it is based off of the 1978 horror movie of the same name. The interesting thing about this
3632500	3638660	game is that it doesn't have any of the characters named, including the killer. You just sort of have
3638660	3645860	to assume it's Michael Myers, even though the cover art for the box is the movie poster.
3646820	3654500	So the way that you play this game is that you play a babysitter who has to save children
3654500	3662500	from a knife wielding killer. So what you do is you have to take them to safe rooms located
3662500	3669780	at both ends of each floor of the house and or by stabbing the killer with the knife.
3669780	3677140	If it can be found, you advance by either rescuing five children or stabbing the killer twice.
3677860	3682980	As the levels progress, the killer gets faster and faster and it's game over when all of your
3682980	3689300	three lives are lost. Now, there was some controversy about this game. Number one,
3690020	3698020	this game had gore. Well, Atari 2600 level gore, but gore nonetheless. There were these scenes
3698020	3704180	where after one of the victims is stabbed that blood is showing actually squirting from their
3704180	3714660	body. For Atari 2600, that's gore. And people were really put off by that. They thought it was too
3714900	3724180	violent. Many retailers refused to carry the game. And the other game released by Wizard Video,
3724180	3728740	the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, also after a horror movie around the same time.
3730340	3737140	They actually ran out of money and went bankrupt. So while they were shipping out some of the games,
3737140	3741940	they didn't have labels on them. Instead, they had masking tape that said Halloween
3741940	3746740	handwritten on it. A lot of retailers rejected the game because of this.
3748180	3753460	And while it wasn't a great game, it really isn't. It was still better received than the
3753460	3760660	Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And because the limited numbers of it is now a highly valued item amongst
3760660	3767780	Atari collectors. Trust me, look on eBay and look at what they go for. And if you have one of these,
3767780	3771380	give it to me. I'm kidding. Actually, no, I'm not. Send it to me. I want it,
3772100	3776580	even though it's not a great game. But that is our classic game of the week,
3777140	3781060	Halloween. And as for all of y'all, Happy Halloween.
3784420	3788580	All right. There it is the classic game of the week, Halloween on the Atari 2600,
3789140	3794580	which I have to admit, I forgot that they did a Halloween on the Atari 2600. I completely forgot.
3795300	3801780	I know some of the classic movie based Atari 2600 games like E.T.
3802420	3808500	But I forgot there was Halloween. So there's that. Dark Soccer is actually in chat saying,
3808500	3814660	I worked really hard on that. They know it was nice, especially for those that were able to
3814660	3819220	see the visuals here live on Twitch. But it still works on the podcast feed as well. But yeah, so
3819860	3824180	Jamie's actually teased that she might do more of those prerecorded so she can do some more
3824180	3828660	fun stuff with the visuals there. So, you know, if you liked that, tell Jamie you want to see more.
3829940	3834660	Fifth Dream also says pork meat. And also, we could probably put those videos on our
3834660	3838820	YouTube channel. Hint, hint. So that, you know, a little something extra, you know,
3838820	3846340	on there. So something to think about. Fifth Dream says Porky's. Oh, God. Yeah, that was a
3846340	3853380	terrible movie. And yeah, I forgot there was that game as well. My gosh, my gosh. All right. Anyway,
3853380	3857860	all right. We're going to get right back into it and travel around the industry and check out some
3857860	3865780	other news going on quite rapidly and rapid fire news. So, yes, Loki and rapid Witcher news. We
3865780	3871700	have the news that Henry Cavill is going to be not appearing in the fourth season of The Witcher
3871700	3877140	on Netflix, probably because he's going to be Superman again. And so instead we're getting
3877140	3885140	Liam Hensworth. And nobody's excited about that. But Superman, that's good.
3885940	3890180	Why? Why do we hate him? Besides the fact he's Miley Cyrus's ex? Like,
3890180	3895300	is there celebrity gossip I'm missing? I don't know. Probably it's he's not as cool as Henry
3895300	3901220	Cavill. But man, I don't care. I didn't watch any of the seasons of The Witcher, so it doesn't
3901220	3907060	matter to me. I know some people very depressed about this news. I get it. Like, it's weird to
3907060	3911700	change the star right in the middle of the show. You don't see that happen a lot. I mean, it's
3911700	3918260	happened before. Well, I think the new Witcher is not supposed to have Gerald either. It's supposed
3918260	3925060	to be a different Witcher. So maybe they do that. And I don't know. And the chat is pointing out
3925060	3930340	this is because Henry Cavill is going to be busy as Superman. Yes. Right. Exactly. I mean,
3930580	3935380	I'm probably not supposed to. I don't know. I don't follow movies enough. But apparently,
3935380	3939220	Superman shows up in one of these recent DC movies. And it's very obvious. Well,
3939220	3944740	we just had the news recently, right? Like, one of those big directors on that had done the Marvel
3944740	3949860	side of the house, right? Is now going to be over like a new DC movie because everybody,
3949860	3954660	everybody knows the DC movies. Not great. But like, they're restructuring that whole thing.
3954740	3960660	I think I was reading somewhere, right? James Gunn, thank you. And pot culture says he did
3960660	3968260	do some DC as well. Yeah, he did the last Suicide Squad movie. And I liked that. I liked that movie.
3968260	3972900	It was pretty good. What I watched, Wonder Woman, I hear was a big exception to Wonder
3972900	3978660	Woman movies are pretty good. Yeah, the Wonder Woman movies are good. Would I watch more DC
3979460	3985940	because of that? Probably not. I hear that. Shazam is pretty good.
3989140	3995140	Yeah, I don't know about Black Adam. Some people like Black Adam. But once again,
3995140	3999460	this is so funny. sj 100. Matt and Chad says Liam Liam Hensworth
3999460	4003780	is to Chris Hemsworth as Billy Baldwin is to Alec Baldwin ouch.
4004580	4007380	Ouch.
4009860	4014260	Well, we're gonna say are you saying as Eric Roberts is to Julia Roberts? Is that what you're
4014260	4024660	saying? Anyway, go ahead. We're getting a remake of the very first Witcher game in Unreal five.
4024660	4031300	So that's going to be worked on as well by CG product red. So that sounds cool.
4031300	4036180	Maybe I'll have Liam Hemsworth as a drought. No one.
4039140	4041860	Maybe not. If you're Liam Hemsworth, though, how excited are you?
4042500	4049220	Like you're, you're having a great week. If you're just give him a chance, I guess. I don't know.
4049220	4056740	But yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's talk about the arcade archives series, which, you know,
4056740	4061540	is on Nintendo Switch, and I believe ps4 and therefore bs5 by association, you know,
4061540	4067620	there are a lot of there's over 100 games in the arcade archive series, and they're still coming.
4067620	4071540	And just recently announced another game that we're going to be seeing in arcade archives is
4072100	4079060	ordain. ordain is a game that was released in Japanese arcades in 1988. It's it's similar in
4079060	4085220	some aspects to Parodius. But in ordain, you are playing a professor that takes to the skies to
4085220	4090500	rescue his kidnapped sweetheart, who's been deducted by his rival. So yeah, get very,
4090500	4096820	very standard 80s storyline there. But yeah, it's very, very colorful little shooter type game. So
4096820	4101620	it's cute. There was a port on the PC engine. But since of course, this is the arcade archives,
4101620	4107620	we are talking about the arcade version. So yeah, this is actually also the first time this game has
4107620	4112180	shown up in the West. It has never been on a Namco collection of any sort or anything like that. So
4112180	4117540	that's kind of interesting, too. So pretty cool. All right, let's travel around the world and check
4117540	4122660	out some games you're going to be able to get this week as well. That one is one I think that's
4122660	4126740	coming out very soon digitally. But what's coming to the more traditional game stores lucky this
4126740	4133140	week. We have lonesome village on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation five and Xbox series.
4133780	4138980	Doraemon story of seasons friends of the great kingdom on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation
4138980	4150260	five. Sumiko, Grashi, Mina de rhythm party on Nintendo Switch. We have the chant on PC,
4150260	4160420	PlayStation five and Xbox series, ghost song on PC, Iron Man VR on PC, harvest Stella on
4160420	4168740	PC and Nintendo Switch. Nikkei goddess of victory on Android and iOS. And that's it.
4170500	4176180	All right. Let's go over to Japan and check out some of the releases that are coming out over
4176180	4181460	there. And then I'll ask Loki to do the UK dates with Dark Soccer out this week. But coming out in
4181460	4187460	Japan, we have on the Nintendo Switch we have Sumiko, Grashi, Mina de rhythm party, which I
4187460	4191700	think I heard Loki mentioned as well. That is a game that's coming out. I wonder what kind of
4191700	4198020	rhythm party it is. It looks like it looks like they're all singing in this game. You press
4198020	4202660	buttons and shake the joy cons to the rhythm of the music. Well, that sounds like samba de amigo
4202660	4206020	or something. That sounds like it could be fun. That's really the only major release on the
4206020	4212260	Nintendo Switch this week. Yeah, it does look a little like bear things. Going over to the
4212260	4217620	PlayStation five this week we have Doraemon story of seasons friends of the great kingdom
4218260	4223140	that is out from Bandai Namco this week on the PS five and that is that's really the only major
4223140	4228420	release in Japan this week. It's kind of a slow week in Japan. I will say though next week. Where's
4228420	4232740	Tiger Claw? Tiger Claw? Where are you? Tiger Claw? Pay attention because next week in Japan,
4232740	4238100	and I think this actually might be the entire world as well. But I noticed that Sonic Frontiers
4238100	4241620	is November 8. And that's gonna be that's gonna be a big one for some people. So
4241700	4248020	worldwide as a worldwide release. So check that out. November 8. All right. How about the UK
4248020	4255140	Loki and in lieu of Dark Sakura not being here tonight? The UK we've got train sim world three
4255140	4264180	on PlayStation and Xbox horsetails on PlayStation and the switch. The chance is that never mind.
4264180	4269060	Just go ahead. Keep reading. I don't know. It doesn't say it's Emerald Valley Ranch. So
4269060	4276820	I don't think no, I don't think that that is Sarah Jessica Parker. Okay. Actually,
4277700	4286020	the chant on PlayStation and Xbox we have a tourney am Noctis on PlayStation and the switch
4286900	4293860	humankind heritage edition on PlayStation. We have death's door on PlayStation and switch
4294420	4302580	harvest Stella on the switch brats flaunt your fashion on PlayStation, Xbox and the switch.
4303860	4310340	It takes two on the switch Ghostbusters spirits unleashed collector's edition on the PlayStation.
4311300	4315620	And that's it. All right. We have a few more stories for you. And then we're going to be
4315620	4321940	opening up our discord server to some phone calls. If you want to give us a call over at vog
4321940	4325860	network.com slash discord. And even if you don't want to call us, if you're listening on the
4325860	4330180	podcast feed, for example, you're not here live tonight, you can always leave some messages and
4330180	4334020	some notes in the orange launch radio channel or any of our discussion channels throughout the
4334020	4339300	week. I do read and actively participate in the OLR chat. So and I know Loki has an eye on that
4339300	4344500	too. Dark soccer, dark soccer makes a cameo once in a while the discord server, but she's there too.
4344500	4348740	And so you know, if you want to chat with us throughout the week, you can do that over the
4348740	4354580	discord server. So I just urge y'all to join, we limit our use of at everyone. In fact,
4355220	4359220	we don't use it. So don't worry about that type of spam, even though it is good,
4359220	4362980	whenever I joined a new discourse or anytime I joined a new discourse or that's the first thing
4362980	4367460	I turn off. And I think anyone out there who's considering setup, setting up a discord server,
4367460	4373060	please realize the app feature has been ruined for everybody. So I would just assume any discord
4373060	4376820	server you set up those features are not going to do any good because everybody's turning them off
4376820	4381780	now. So something to think about anyway. Moving on, we're gonna get back into a few news stories.
4381780	4386020	Unfortunately, these are not the great kind of news stories here. We've had some passings in our
4386020	4390260	industry this week. But let's take a moment to remember and acknowledge those that we've lost
4390260	4399140	this last week, Loki. Yeah, we have Reiko Kodama, who was a developer at Sega. She had worked on
4399140	4407220	quite a few different things, including Phantasy Star, Skies of Acadia, Alex Kidd, Sonic.
4409220	4412260	This is like the golden age of Sega, like all those games, right?
4412980	4420580	Yeah. So she started with the company back in 1984. And pretty much worked on a lot of stuff
4420580	4428660	during like the pixel art days, I guess. So gosh, she was labeled the first lady of RPGs.
4429140	4435300	And award a Pioneer Award at GBC 2018. I heard the way that we kind of found out
4435300	4439780	about this was because they put us very small tribute to her in the Mega Drive 2
4440740	4444740	that came out recently, the mini, the new like Genesis, yeah, to that hold the Sega Mini 2
4444740	4450420	thing that came out recently. And they put a small tribute and somebody had actually tweeted going,
4450420	4455460	you know, usually when you say in memory of so and so that per and they actually confirmed
4455460	4462180	she unfortunately passed away. So that's sad. Yeah, she was 59. That's way too young.
4462180	4468260	That's too bad. And speaking of way too young, someone on the more contemporary side of games,
4468260	4474340	someone you probably heard if you ever played the game Death Stranding also passed away just within
4474340	4481380	the last couple days. The frontman of the band Low Roar, his name was Ryan Karajia. I hope I
4481380	4486740	said that right, passed away at the age of 40. That's Oh my gosh, I mean, that's our age. So
4486740	4492100	that's really depressing. And this was confirmed, unfortunately, via the band social media pages.
4492660	4499300	Hideo Kojima, of course, the mind behind Death Stranding, really pouring out the condolences
4499300	4505460	on Twitter about the vocalist of this game, or excuse me, the vocalist of Low Roar, because of
4505460	4513220	the impact that the music had on Death Stranding. The song All Keep Coming played in the very first
4513220	4518660	trailer for Death Stranding. A song called Don't Be So Serious was one of the first tracks you would
4518660	4521940	hear during the opening scene of the game. I guarantee you, if you've heard the song,
4521940	4525860	you've ever played the game like, Oh, this, I remember this, the first time I heard this song,
4525860	4533300	so it's very, very important in setting the tone for that game. So yeah, on Low Roar social media
4533300	4539940	post, they paid tribute to Kara Zizia, calling him the driving force behind Low Roar, crediting
4539940	4545620	him for music and lyrics and his haunting voice, which again, if you've heard the songs, very,
4545620	4550740	very unfortunate. They did mention that they did record their sixth studio album, and that would
4550740	4557060	be the last project from Ryan and it will be released when it's ready. No date there. So
4557540	4562740	uh, in the statement of tweet, a series of tweets, Hideo Kojima said, you know, expressed his shock
4562740	4568820	over this saying the game would not have been complete Death Stranding without Low Roar's music.
4568820	4575860	So very sad. So kind of a, you have a classic, uh, game maker and a contemporary game contributor
4575860	4582340	really, you know, on both ends there, unfortunately losing both this week. So that stinks. Uh, we have
4582420	4587620	a few more stories in the meantime. Uh, Loki, I'm curious about this next one. This sounds
4587620	4594100	interesting. Yeah. So Sega is looking to do an intend, don't, and that is, they're going to make
4594100	4603460	making a super game. That's going to be coming out by March, 2026. Um, this is a super game project
4603460	4608900	that they don't really, they're not really talking about it, but apparently it's some large scale
4608900	4615540	game that they're working on. Uh, one key to achieving this goal is whether we can, uh, draw
4615540	4620340	together a large community involving not only players, also streamers who stream the game and
4620340	4624820	viewers who watch their videos, that kind of community expands the further development game
4624820	4629700	content, adding value to the game. It's unimagined by developers sparking broader movement, which
4629700	4634820	they can draw on even more user base, blah, blah, blah. Um, sounds to me something like, uh,
4634820	4639860	you know, very like a sandbox type, you know, like a Minecraft or like a Fortnite or something
4639860	4646900	like that, where there's kind of a growing progression of content for the game driven by
4646900	4653700	fans of it and stuff. So interesting. Don't know what that would be, but it's,
4653700	4659460	it's very ambitious then it's not something we're going to see anytime soon, but neat.
4664820	4668580	I don't know what it's about.
4677300	4681540	Oh, I'm sorry. My mic's been off this whole time. Oh my gosh. Uh, I was, I was, uh,
4681540	4686740	sorry for the awkward silence there, but, um, I was typing. I try to mute myself when I type
4686740	4691220	so that the clicking doesn't come through and I'm not always successful. So I was just joking that,
4692180	4695940	the next step now is to get an announcement of the announcement because that's, that's the first
4695940	4701060	thing we have to do. Right. And I'm very curious about, um, what this game is all about. So yeah,
4701060	4706100	it's, it's hype before that we even know what they're hyping up. Yeah, exactly. Right. All
4706100	4713220	right. Um, last and least, um, tonight, uh, I said I was really done talking about this,
4713220	4717700	but unfortunately the news keeps coming and I have to mention what happened this week in the
4718580	4724500	Bayonetta voice actor saga. Yes, I'm going back to that topic. Here's what happened this week.
4724500	4727780	So Helena Taylor, of course, you know, she said in some tweets this week,
4727780	4732260	my posts have hit a nerve with people. Low pay resonates, not just in the gaming industry,
4732260	4737940	but in the wider world beyond all over the planet to do it, donate your boycott money.
4737940	4743860	There are many small local charities that can help. And there were some traditional charities
4743860	4747940	that were there, like some food banks and some organizations that helped with the homeless and
4747940	4752180	things like that. Uh, there were some other organizations that were in there as well. She said
4752740	4757860	that these were organizations. She contributed her supplemental income from her convention
4757860	4765540	appearance. I think singular too. Um, but anyway, it was very interesting. Some of the other, uh,
4765540	4770020	charities that were mentioned here, uh, the student pizza fund for the London Academy of Music
4770020	4774580	and Dramatic Arts. That's fine. Pet welfare groups. Sure. But there was another interesting
4774580	4782340	one that stood out. Billboards for life. This is an organization that makes roadside propaganda
4782340	4788020	with, uh, it's basically anti-abortion propaganda. For example, um, fetuses that are showing in the
4788020	4794660	praying position, uh, quotes that say I could dream before I was born and so forth. Um, so
4795460	4802980	Helena Taylor is using her campaign to, um, urge people to donate to an anti-abortion, uh, charity,
4802980	4807780	which there's not, I mean, some people would agree with that, but, um, there are a lot of other
4807780	4814180	people that would not agree with that stance. Um, so it's, um, you know, again, it's a lot of people
4814180	4820580	are sort of questioning what exactly was her motivation with this whole thing and so forth.
4820580	4824900	I really have nothing else to say on all of this. I, I'm just going to point to,
4825540	4832900	I done said it already three weeks ago here on this show, and I told you then, um, if this was
4832900	4840180	the tweet that finally woke you up to what's going on, congratulations. Um, I accept apologies in the
4840180	4846660	form of Venmo and cash app payments. I'm just kidding. Tell a friend about the show. That's
4846660	4852020	all we really want to happen here at orange launch radio, but needless to say, when I said
4852020	4858500	she would never work in the game industry again, she's not going to now I do like this and thank
4858500	4863860	you quest buster for pointing this out because this is very, uh, very important to point out
4864420	4869940	the, another voice actress within Bayonetta three, Anna Brisbane, she voices a new character named
4869940	4874260	Viola, and she was able to kind of, you know, unmask this week. Cause the game is now out.
4874260	4882100	She can say, yes, I did this. She did a charity run raising $5,000 for various trans rights groups.
4882820	4889460	And I, I, that is a very well, well, it's a great cause to begin with. And I don't, I don't,
4889460	4895620	you know, I don't want to make, uh, these charity organizations, you know, any sort of like, I don't
4895620	4902980	even want to use the word joke, but my point is this is very much a tongue in cheek kind of,
4902980	4907780	I think, counterpoint to a lot of what we've been talking about these last three weeks.
4907780	4913460	And I think this is Anna Brisbane sort of coming out and saying, don't worry. I'm not like her.
4915380	4920180	I really think it is, but she's not saying that, but she's saying that.
4921540	4926820	So, uh, but congrats to Anna Brisbane on that role. Uh, and, uh, Bayonetta three's been getting
4926820	4930580	pretty good reviews across the board. I'm not sure it's quite as up there as Bayonetta two,
4930580	4934900	but to still be even in the eighties, high eighties at that and getting some perfect
4934900	4939540	review scores from some websites on your third game is still pretty good. So, um,
4939540	4946100	I, I congratulations to Anna Brisbane, of course, Jennifer Hale, uh, uh, congratulations to platinum
4946100	4950580	on the, you know, games release and all that stuff. Uh, and none for Helena Taylor. Bye.
4951460	4956580	All right. That's it. That's all the news we had for tonight. So now we want to invite
4957060	4960340	one last minute story. If you want. Yes, of course, because I was going to say,
4960340	4963860	we usually would read some emails here to participate at orange,
4963860	4969460	lot of trader.com, but guess what? We still don't have emails. I'm starting to wonder if anyone
4969460	4975060	emails anymore. We get the occasional from Y Y R Ziba or entertainment. I'm not here to name names.
4975060	4979940	I'm just saying. I only noticed there's probably less than five people that have emailed us in the
4979940	4983780	past like six months. And this is why I always threatened to get rid of the mailbag segment.
4983860	4988340	But at the same time, I don't really have anything where people are engaging to replace it with.
4988340	4997860	So that's why the mailbag still lives on for now, but now seeking engagement platform to get more
4997860	5003300	voices on the show through. So if you have some thoughts, I'm very curious. Uh, Bobby says he
5003300	5009460	has breaking news. I'd be very curious to hear that. Oh, that's great news. Guess what? Bobby
5009460	5014900	just breaking on the show. Do you do if you want to hop in the green room, Bobby,
5016100	5022340	or just barge on in, I don't give a shit and tell us here live on air. You can tell us if you want.
5022340	5025860	I'll read it if you don't want to do it for whatever reason. Uh, Loki though, what's your,
5025860	5030660	what's your last minute topic here? Well, not to be Debbie downer here, but, um,
5030660	5037620	Adriana Chechik has returned back to stream since her accident at TwitchCon where she broke her back
5037620	5043300	in two places. Right. Um, she talked a little bit about her recovery and also gave the bad news
5043300	5049620	saying that unfortunately at the time she didn't know that she was pregnant at the time of the
5049620	5058260	injury and surgery. She lost Loki. That's horrible. Oh, I wish you'd warned me. That's Oh, that's
5058260	5064660	awful. Oh my God. I think that definitely the people behind TwitchCon have to pay for that
5065620	5069300	for sure. They need to, somebody needs to answer for that.
5071620	5076580	Holy moly. Cause I mean, not only could you have killed like some of the adults there,
5076580	5081460	but you did, you did kill somebody. So it's just, it's horrible.
5083220	5087220	I literally have no words and I'm about to just press the end of the show button. So
5087220	5093140	anyway, um, do you have anything else please to, to palette reset or something that's,
5093140	5097460	that's really, that's, that's, that's hard. I saw a cool picture of, uh, somebody that made us,
5097460	5101700	uh, one of those century bots from portal out of a pumpkin. That was fun. Okay. Yeah.
5102660	5107460	As soon as Matt says someone throw a pie, uh, Loki, go hit yourself in the face of the pie,
5107460	5112900	please. All right. Actually, here, here's, uh, we're going to welcome Bobby Black Wolf on, um,
5112900	5116100	because I know Bobby had just got some really good news and I definitely want to hear like,
5116100	5122020	what's going on. So hi, Bobby, are you there? Yeah, I am. Hang on. Give me a second here.
5122020	5125940	Cause I haven't done this pie before. I know. No, I don't think you've been on our side of
5125940	5129620	the house in quite a while. So, and I got to make sure you're very loud, but that's okay. It's,
5129620	5134820	it's on my side, not your side. All right. Oh, Bobby's coming through a video. Great.
5134820	5140180	Here we go. Hi, how are you? Yeah. All right. Post-show area. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
5141460	5145540	I'm great. So the chat knows your news, but the podcast listeners don't yet. So tell me,
5145540	5149860	tell me the news. Cause I think this is really exciting. Yeah. So I just got the email
5149940	5156340	literally like, what is Gmail saying here? Uh, three minutes ago, three minutes ago. Uh,
5156340	5161140	but, uh, I am one of the 22 volunteers selected to be a host for awesome games done quick 2023.
5163540	5168660	Applause. Applause. Congratulations. Cause it's never guaranteed. It is never guaranteed. You,
5168660	5174340	uh, you re audition every time, which is good because, um, then we'd never get any new blood in
5174340	5180420	and there are people that have auditioned, you know, or there are people who've hosted
5180420	5186100	HDQ in the past, maybe done seven or eight events that can't get in anymore. Uh, and it's, but,
5186100	5190180	and it's a good thing that we let new blood come in because some people are like, well, you know,
5190180	5195140	why don't they just have like a set of hosts that they trust that can do, you know, that are there
5195140	5200020	all the time. There are only 22 spots in that list is longer than 22 people. So how do you pick
5200580	5209140	from the 22 trusted veterans on, you know, when you have more than 22. So I am, I am, uh,
5209140	5213780	I am thrilled and excited and I have to probably be posting on social media tonight. So I wanted
5213780	5220180	to give you the heads up here on board scope. I'm very excited. That's great. And so for,
5220180	5224420	for your audience who probably does, don't know what you actually have to do to audition. Uh,
5224420	5228820	and I can, I can talk a little bit about it, but I don't want to get too much into it, but, uh,
5229460	5233060	we're not even at an hour and a half. So by all means, give us a peek behind the curtain.
5233060	5238900	We got time. Absolutely. Um, so, uh, essentially what they have you do is they give you a video
5238900	5246420	file and you then they say, okay, here's a list. Here's some sponsor blurbs and here's a bunch of
5246420	5251380	donations. They give that to you in, in, in like a Google doc and there's a video and the video
5251380	5256260	has two minutes of just nothing. That's the time between games. And then the first six minutes of
5256260	5261300	a speed run. And during the speed run, the runner will be like, okay, now let's throw, you know,
5261300	5264820	let's have some donations and you're supposed to read some donations. So they're checking
5265460	5272740	how you structure your two minutes of you talking and then how you determine which donations to read
5272740	5278580	and what you say during the speed run. And they'll even say, uh, the runner is looking for us,
5278580	5282260	this specific community member, they're a friend. They want to hear their donation.
5282260	5286340	They'll say things like, you know, we're really trying to push for this or please, you know,
5286340	5292500	promote this part, you know, this prize or this, you know, this upcoming speed run, a bonus game,
5292500	5297380	whatever. Uh, they'll actually, they'll tell you that. And then you put in that thing, uh,
5297380	5304420	your eight minutes you uploaded is an unlisted YouTube video. And then they get, uh, 20 amazing
5304420	5310660	volunteers. I almost said suckers, but 20 amazing volunteers or 25 amazing volunteers or something.
5310660	5314980	They have to listen to everybody's audition and they watch everybody's audition and then they
5314980	5320900	score them on several subjective and objective things. So there's scores about, you know,
5320900	5324820	you get an extra point. If you read this donation, you lose a point. If you read this donation,
5324820	5329380	then it all averages together. But they also have some subjective things. Were they energetic? What's
5329380	5337220	their tonal voice like stuff like that? 112 auditions. Each audition is about eight minutes
5337220	5343940	long. Oh my gosh. And they selected 22. Congratulations. There were 17. There were
5343940	5350500	17 judge volunteers. I'm getting to this part of the email. They send stats. Um, and, uh, yeah.
5350500	5356980	And it's basically, it's a score out of 50. Uh, the 22 people had to score 42 out of 50. What'd
5356980	5361940	you get? What'd you get? I don't know. They don't tell me what I get yet. Okay. Um, I have to
5361940	5365780	actually ask, I can get feedback and then I get like the judge's comments and so I can figure out
5365780	5372580	what I'm going to work on. Uh, but, uh, the high score was 45.8. Oh, so nobody, nobody gets a
5372580	5376580	perfect score. No, no, nobody's ever gotten a perfect score. I think like one time somebody
5376580	5382340	got like over a 46, but usually like in the 45 is your high score. So there is, there's only like
5382340	5389380	three points separating first and number one and number 22. And then there are six backups
5390100	5395220	who scored more than 41 points, but less than 42. And that was six. So there were six people
5395220	5401380	that placed in the 41. And the first time I did this SGDQ 2020, I was in that backup group. Yeah.
5402100	5407460	I had just missed the cutoff line, but still that's great because you've done every single
5407460	5412740	one since. So, but I know, I know you work on your craft and you listen to the feedback and you've,
5412740	5416820	um, you know, kind of talked to others within the community and I'm sure you all kind of, you know,
5416820	5420340	talk about what works and what doesn't work. And that just helps I'm sure at the end of the day.
5420340	5427060	So, yeah. Yeah. And the downside of, of, of the hosting audition process and, you know, I'm not,
5427060	5433540	I don't mind talking about this is that it really helps that I've done it, done the actual event
5433540	5437220	because there's lots of things the judges look for that they don't tell you. And you'd only know if
5437220	5443300	you ever did an event. And so that's why you do see a lot of the same people hosting in every each
5443300	5447540	event. It's because once you've done one, you know what the judges are looking for and you know,
5447540	5452740	the little two things to put in that they don't tell you necessarily in the audition documents.
5452740	5456980	Yeah. And I don't, I didn't, you know, people should not listen to that comment and read into
5456980	5461700	it. Like, Oh, it's, it's rigged. That's not it. It's just that, you know, as again, you talked
5461700	5465860	about that there was a subjectiveness to the energy. How do you know the appropriate level
5465860	5471140	of energy? Well, either you've listened to a lot of the, you know, in, in the past, because
5471140	5476180	certainly if somebody was over energetic, you know, you know, if you're talking about,
5476180	5480660	let's talk about the prevent cancer foundation, you know, it's like, maybe that's a little too
5480660	5486340	much energy. Yeah. Yeah. But how do you know that? Unless you like, listen, you get that feedback
5486340	5490340	and that sort of thing. So I, you know, again, cause, cause when you say it that way, there's,
5490340	5495220	there's going to be people that will read into that, that, Oh, it's rigged. Cause you know,
5495220	5498660	you know how the internet works with the conspiracies. Yes. But it's not rigged.
5498660	5505620	It's just, it's on the job experience helps. Yes. Yeah. And yeah. And so a lot of people
5505620	5509460	will sit there and they'll like redo theirs and stuff. And I will say mine wasn't the first take.
5509460	5514260	They don't ask for your first take. They let you watch the video. You can see what the timing is
5514260	5518340	supposed to be. You can read through the donations because they don't want you reading every donation
5518340	5522100	because they throw in things that you shouldn't read on the air. And they're like, can you,
5522100	5528100	what's your judgment? And me doing this, my show and working with you and working with VOG,
5528100	5532820	doing this for 17 years, having to read chat comments in real time and react on the air
5532820	5540500	has helped a lot for sure with that. For sure. So, so I'm, I'm thrilled that I got in. I don't
5540500	5545380	know, like now I've got to tell them what I'm interested in hosting because the game list is
5545380	5552100	out 14. I know I, well, so that's, that's probably going to be an in-demand one though. It's going
5552100	5559060	to be very in demand. So there's like Froude who I've hosted many things before. He didn't get in
5559060	5564740	and I don't think there's any Yakuza runs in anyway. I'll have to check. Well, I mean,
5564740	5569140	I also understand they got to, they got to mix it up. They can't have the same thing every year.
5569140	5574500	And also this is the, this is the one that is going to be virtual because it's virtual again.
5574500	5580740	Yeah. We talked about, you know, a few weeks ago that they had to kind of not be in Florida
5580740	5585860	anymore for a variety of reasons. And that is a risk that they're taking with that. So,
5585940	5589780	and that's why there were over a hundred auditions. The, for SGDQ, I think there were
5589780	5596020	only like 90 something auditions. So because anybody around the world can, can be in your,
5596020	5601140	you're now, you know, I was competing against people in Australia that wouldn't have been able
5601140	5605540	to make it to, to America. Couldn't afford to make it to America, you know, cause that's a lot of
5605540	5611060	money. They were able, they were in the mix and other people who probably still aren't comfortable
5611060	5615780	with large gatherings, they were in the mix. So, you know, it was, it was a lot, it was probably
5615780	5620980	a tougher competition this time around. So I'm just very thankful that I, that I get to work
5620980	5625700	with them again. Very curious to see what summer looks like too, you know, with, you know, I know
5625700	5630180	it's a ways out, but just, just very curious to see how that shapes up in light of what happened
5630180	5634340	with this one. But I know it's still going to be great. It's still the virtual ones have been
5634340	5639300	awesome. A lot of people kind of think they should keep mixing the virtual with the in-person ones,
5639300	5643540	or at least, you know, have some out. So it's, it's cool that we are getting that. And yeah,
5643540	5647460	I'm, I'm thrilled you get to be involved with that again. And very curious to see what you end
5647460	5651380	up posting, especially since there is no Yakuza one that would certainly have you with it.
5651380	5655780	Right. Yeah. There, there are some games in there and I've also gotten to meet people that I think
5655780	5660420	that are running and stuff. So I may be able to, you know, now that I've actually been a part of
5660420	5664740	the community for, you know, a couple of times now, and I've gotten to meet some of the runners,
5664740	5668100	either working with them in the past or meeting them in Minneapolis when I was there.
5669380	5675140	You know, I, I may, you know, have some people that want me there. So that's, that's some runners
5675140	5679540	that would, cause runners can ask for a specific host as well. It's not just one way. That's great.
5679540	5684580	So, so we'll see. The summer one will most likely be at that same hotel in Minneapolis. They're
5684580	5690580	pretty happy with that arrangement. So it's, it's just, where is Awesome Games Done Quick 2024 going
5690580	5695860	to be? Because I think some of the stuff, the reason they moved it from Virginia to Florida was
5695860	5700900	a, they wanted to be near a major airport and also they wanted it less likely that winter
5700900	5706340	weather was going to affect it because it was happening in mid January. So it would be snowing
5706340	5711460	in Virginia and it's hard for people to get around if they're not from the area. Like I didn't want
5711460	5717060	to drive up there, you know, that's why I loved magfest in March that one time. Cause it was after
5717060	5723060	all the winter weather stuff. I'm so now, as she says, move it to Atlanta. Wink, wink. I have a
5723060	5729620	better idea. I'm just going to say it doesn't rain anymore here in, uh, you know, lovely Los Angeles
5729620	5736580	or San Diego or Las Vegas would all be excellent choices that are all near major airports. I'm just
5736580	5743300	saying yes, but also what they're looking at is the cost. Well, but I, I would still argue Vegas
5743300	5748020	is always cheap, cheap hub, but yeah, I get it. I get it. They got to find the right match.
5748580	5752500	And I, and I know people are saying move it to Atlanta and I'd love that too. Um,
5752500	5757220	because obviously we can handle it here. It's just the thing I worry about and I don't want
5757220	5762820	to get into details or go on, go on about this, but, uh, Georgia has its own political problems.
5763780	5769700	And so I'm not sure if the games done quick organization, which I have said is progressive
5769700	5774980	to a fault sometimes. Uh, I don't know if they would be comfortable being in Georgia. They
5774980	5779380	wouldn't be comfortable being in Texas. So if this is the line that they're going to take,
5779380	5784500	I can't see them coming to Georgia right now. And that's again, why Vegas jumps out at me
5784500	5789060	as Vegas is more purple or Nevada is more of a purple state, right? So it's, it's, it's a
5789060	5794100	very well-known swing state. So I, I, I kind of feel like, I don't know, Vegas, Vegas just
5794660	5798900	is the solution to everything. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah. How about Georgia's purple too,
5798900	5805060	but it's just true, but the rules, we have the laws that are on the books can, can fair,
5805060	5811140	have some people take second, you know, not want to come here. Yeah, I get it. So we're,
5811140	5815780	we're working on it. I live here. We're working on it. Early voting is open right now in many
5815780	5823620	States. It is here too. So I reminds I got to fill out my ballot. So yeah, I already did mine.
5823620	5827940	All right. Well, Bobby, I appreciate you coming back. I come in over on our show and giving us
5827940	5833060	that breaking news. And again, congratulations. They're lucky to have you, um, really look forward
5833060	5837140	to seeing what your trajectory and your path through that look, looks like and what games
5837140	5841300	you're going to be involved with. So I'm looking forward to it. All right, Bobby, you take care.
5841300	5846900	Thanks for joining us tonight. Thank you. All right. Bye. All right. Always good to hear from
5846900	5851220	Mr. Black Wolf here on OLR. He's good enough to have me on a show every week to promote what
5851220	5855780	we're doing here. So I have no problem having him here. Uh, if you want to be on orange on radio,
5855780	5859460	you can hop in our green room, but you better do it real quick. Cause, uh, I'm about to think
5859460	5864660	there's no calls that want to come, uh, in, uh, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash
5864660	5869940	vog network. A lot of, uh, echoing of the go vote, uh, statements, Jaskren saying, go vote.
5869940	5874580	Dark to see us saying indeed already sent ours out with voting. Good, good. Okay. S Jonah Matt has a
5874580	5882100	good question for us. What are your favorite TV Halloween specials on the Paul and Halloween
5882100	5889940	special? Uh, my favorite specials on TV for Halloween are always the Simpsons Halloween
5889940	5894420	episodes. The tree house, the new one that they have coming out now with the anime Simpsons,
5894420	5899460	the death note. Yeah. I mean, I need to watch that tonight. Isn't it? Or is it next week? Yeah.
5899460	5903780	It's tonight. So, um, that looks awesome. But yeah, the Simpsons Halloween specials
5903780	5909540	are always great. That's a really good answer. Um, that's good. Um, I don't know. I get more,
5909540	5915300	I don't really get into a lot of the Halloween ones. I mean, I always love a good Elvira
5915300	5918820	appearance on television, but you know, she, Cassandra Peterson, isn't really performing
5918820	5923860	that part. Like it's a very special occasion. She does, um, Elvira at this point. Um, I was
5923860	5928900	going to say one other one. It's not TV, but since we live in the age of YouTube, uh, red
5928900	5935860	letter media's Halloween specials, their, um, best of the worst, all these, um, stuff is always good.
5936820	5940500	Um, I'm looking in chat at some of the comments here as the show and Hunter Matt says they
5940500	5944740	brought back David S. Pumpkins last night. I forgot about that. That's good. Zen monkey
5944740	5950340	11 says the worst, which that's a good pick is too. We love Tim Curry in that one. Uh,
5950340	5953780	dark soccer is saying I'm going to be the Halloween special by playing Cenobite.
5953780	5963940	You open the box. I came, so, uh, where will play night was good. It's short. It's only like 50
5963940	5970180	minutes. Nice. All right. Uh, Dr. Sia says the great pumpkin Charlie Brown picked it up on DVD
5970180	5977940	because I noticed it stopped airing on TV. Nice. All right. All right. Well, nobody else is in the
5977940	5981780	green room, so guess what? We're going to wrap it up. We're done. We're out of here. We're gonna say
5981780	5986180	good night. Good night. Let's get people's final thoughts and get on out of here for the night.
5986180	5991540	Um, Loki, what's your final thought? Oh, actually, wait, before I, before I get that, let me of
5991540	5995540	course say as always, thank you so much for listening to orange launch radio. Thank you
5995540	5998980	for being here tonight. Even though it was a little bit of a shorter show, we were down to
5998980	6004500	host. It happens kind of a slower news week, but thank you for being here and being a part of the
6004500	6008660	community, whether you're here with us live or you are on our podcast feed throughout the week.
6008660	6012740	We appreciate it. We'd love to hear from more podcast people, be it on our Twitter at OLR or
6012740	6016340	our mailbag. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend or
6016340	6019780	two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has
6019780	6024660	a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air, uh, in order to, uh, have them. So, uh,
6024660	6029700	yeah, uh, a nice five star review wherever you found this show that goes an awful long way. So,
6029700	6036020	uh, we really appreciate those. And, um, yeah, I, uh, I don't know what else to say. Uh, we won't
6036020	6039700	be here in two weeks, but we definitely will be here next week. So we will see you all again next
6039700	6045620	week, uh, with another episode of the show. Now I'll go over to Loki and get your final thought
6045620	6054500	tonight. Um, go subscribe to my channel, I guess, low gal are at, um, YouTube. Great. They're going
6054500	6060100	to be getting those. Uh, was it the, I don't know that they call on them now, but it's basically like
6060100	6066900	a, a new URL thing that they're doing. Not nicknames, but it's like something I don't
6066900	6076260	know what they call it. Uh, aliases or something, right? Yes. Um, let's see. Um, oh dark soccer
6076260	6082820	wants to remind people about the marathon that she's doing, uh, and I, I, I I'm okay. It was,
6082820	6087060	I was about to say, is that still happening in light, but, uh, dark soccer does want to point
6087060	6093140	out it's moved to February 15th in light of her own, uh, voice issues. It was going to be Tuesday,
6093140	6097700	but she's just knocking it back two weeks. So, um, heads up on that. Uh, that is going to be
6097700	6104020	on February 15th from noon to midnight, 12 to 12. So, uh, check that out. A dark soccer. Again,
6104020	6107540	she talked more about that on last week's show, but that is for, uh, to support some of the
6107540	6111460	medical issues. Her mother's been going through, uh, recently. So if you want more on that list
6111460	6118340	last week, but the date has changed to February 15th, uh, doctor's orders on that. Um, my final
6118340	6122820	thought tonight. Um, I don't, I mean, I could plug my stuff, but I do that all the time. I
6122820	6128420	would just say I'm, I'm feeling really good about the show last night. I did live Rocky horror. The
6128420	6133220	crowd was fantastic. I have been loving hosting and I've been getting to do a lot more of it
6133220	6138420	this year because the last two years have been asked with COVID for live events. So I'm just
6138420	6142820	really happy to be in the swing of that again. Oh, I'll tell you, I have not even said this on
6142820	6147220	Twitter or anywhere. Cause I just found about it. I found out about it last night. I am hosting
6147220	6152980	another non horror event here locally. This is going to be a fun one. Loki, you could bring the
6152980	6159140	kids to this one. It's this kind of event. So I'm not saying you have to go, but, uh, December 10th
6159140	6164740	here, I am going to be hosting a life or not life screening, but a screening of the movie home
6164740	6171220	alone from the nineties. So, and we actually, yeah, we actually have one of the stars of the
6171220	6174580	movie, not Macaulay Coke. And I'm sorry to say, it's not gonna be there, but, uh, one of the other
6174580	6179300	kids, Angela Goethals, I think is the celebrity's name. She is going to be in attendance. So, and
6179300	6183780	it's a, they're calling it a non horror screening, uh, from love horror events. So it's going to be
6183780	6188260	a holiday thing. Um, so I'm really, really, really excited to do that. That's going to be December
6188260	6193780	10th. So I guess that's my plug here locally for those of you in SAC love horror events.com. If
6193780	6198740	you want to see, um, all, I mean, it could be a horror screen if you, if you believe in the whole,
6198740	6204900	um, home alone in the saw universe thing. Well, and then if you look at a lot of like,
6204900	6209940	what was, you know, like the, the, the, yeah, the traps that, you know, he was setting up for those
6209940	6214100	burglars, it is kind of messed up. If you think about it, it could be a little bit scary. Um,
6214100	6219620	I will also say they are doing a screening of sleepaway camp, the camp, uh, 1980s, uh,
6219620	6225060	movie classic and the Angela or Felicia Rose will be in attendance for that one. Um, I am not
6225060	6228500	hosting it. Unfortunately it is the same weekend. I'm out of town. It's the same weekend. We don't
6228500	6232740	have a show, but I just, I think it's really cool. They're doing that. So yeah, lots of fun
6232740	6237780	shows there. So anyway, um, that's it. We're out of here for tonight. Thank you again for, uh,
6237780	6241460	staying up late with us and, uh, we'll see you in seven days. We'll do this all again. Hopefully
6241460	6245220	dark soccer is clear to come back with us next week and we can all be together again to talk
6245220	6250740	about video games. Have fun playing games this week. Everyone. Good night. You've been listening
