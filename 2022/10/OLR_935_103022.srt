1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,780
I hope you have broadband and aren't close to your download cap because you're going

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,860
to be downloading an entire quadruple layer Blu-ray XL disc's worth of content before

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,620
you can play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2-2. Start the game a few hours before you want

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,220
to play or plan on doing something else while you wait. The amount of data on the physical

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,980
disc? 72 megs. Why even manufacture the disc?

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,220
This is the First World Gamers Only Update. Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts,

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,660
Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,660
Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:44,460
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:52,680
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:02,280
number 935 of our program for tonight, October the 30th of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,520
I am joined every week here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle,

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,960
games and stuff with my co-host, sadly not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers,

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,120
although I just saw her pop up into chat, but she's not joining us live tonight. You've

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,260
probably caught on the past couple of weeks. She's been dealing with some issues with her

16
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:26,900
voice. I'm not at liberty to say all the nuts and bolts of what's going on unless she wants to say

17
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,660
in chat, but I do know she is on doctor ordered rest. She'll be fine, but she's under doctor's

18
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:38,260
orders not to do too much talking. So doing a three hour podcast is a little bit much. However,

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,660
she will be joining us in a prerecorded Classic Game of the Week segment a little later in the

20
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,460
program. So in the meantime, though, of course, we are joined every week by Techmaster Loki. Hi,

21
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:54,820
Loki. Hey, how's it going? Good. How are you? Pretty good. Good. Of course, we do tape live

22
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:01,860
every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network. Nine o'clock Eastern,

23
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,980
six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And you can join us live or you can

24
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,580
barge on in the room as it appears. DarkSakura's just done throwing throwing off my scenes a

25
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,380
little bit. Hi. I just wanted to come in long enough to say hi to everybody and say I'm still

26
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,660
alive. Good. Yeah. The tone would have been much different if you weren't I'm not sure there would

27
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,860
have been a show tonight. Happy Halloween. Hi. Happy Halloween. It's a it's a mess over here. I

28
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,820
have to paint a gravestone at some point. Spooky. So did you want to give a little more insight

29
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:47,340
what's going on? Yeah. So I went to ear nose and throat specialist and I got to see my larynx. I

30
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:55,460
took a picture of it. I've got inflammation on my larynx and there is the flap that's like right

31
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:05,260
above it in the neck has got some damage to it, something that can heal up. So on Wednesday, I

32
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:15,100
speak to a speech therapist to see if I'm fine to come off the voice rest or if they need me to

33
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:22,020
continue or do reduce talking. So like I haven't even been doing my Dead by Daylight streams. I've

34
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:33,420
just been playing RPGs because I don't have to talk. So I I've been gesturing a lot. But right

35
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:40,460
now, this is about as good as my voice has sounded in the last couple of weeks. If I keep talking,

36
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,900
it will, of course, vanish into the abyss. Well, obviously, you probably just need to keep resting

37
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,540
it and hopefully everything goes all right. And, you know, we look forward to hearing how your

38
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,500
recovery keeps going. Yeah. And I'm not on cam because I'm totally in my pajamas. It's totally

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,380
fine. All right. Well, thank you for hopping in and saying hello. We'll hear from you through the

40
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,500
magic of prerecorded bits a little later in the show. Hey, I put a lot of work into that, so

41
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:16,140
people better like it. All right. All right. All right. Where was I? Loki, yes. When I was

42
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,420
introducing you, I was going to say, because, again, we do tape live, we have the video and

43
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,860
sometimes you play things behind you on video. And I actually got really excited when I saw what

44
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,220
game you had going behind you tonight. But for the sake of the podcast listeners who can't see the

45
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,580
game or for those watching live who don't know what it is, can you tell us what you have playing

46
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,660
behind you and why? I have Sim Ant playing behind me. And the reason for that is because they don't

47
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:51,940
have an Ant-Man video game because a new trailer came out for Quantumania. So, OK, nice, nice. No,

48
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,340
I loved Sim Ant. That was one of my favorite games for sure. Yeah, it wasn't one that I played, but

49
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:04,740
my friends had it. So, OK, nice. I also want to just kind of give a weird like FYI. So like some

50
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,380
of my OBS settings got all messed up because I made a transition with my personal streams, which

51
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:16,380
share with the same account to do some Spotify stuff that doesn't get cease and desisted on my

52
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,740
personal streams. It's nothing here for using for Orange Islands right now. But my point is a lot of my

53
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,340
sound settings got screwed up and I had to redo everything. So please let me know if the sound

54
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:32,060
seems off to you and I will try my best to fix it. Like for me, I hear Loki quiet. But when I see the

55
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,140
little meters that I'm looking, he's like probably at a level that's almost above where I'm at. So

56
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,060
I'm assuming everything is fine. Yeah. OK, Bobby Blackwell, he would say something if it was off and

57
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,700
he says sounds fine for me. So I'm going with it. So it's just the wonders of having to change

58
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:55,100
things every now and then. That's for sure. So. All right, let's see, I guess we'll get right into

59
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,140
our kickoff topic for tonight. Loki, did you want to tell us about what's going on? And I got to

60
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,940
say, there isn't like for being Halloween week and everything. There is a lot of news this week, I

61
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,580
gotta say in the gaming world. So

62
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,620
we're in the middle of the fourth, well, almost the end of the fourth quarter, actually. So there's

63
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,300
not going to be a whole ton.

64
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,740
Well, but well, I mean, there's some big game releases still coming because

65
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,180
November

66
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,220
I keep all the secrets for one more month. So then we can release them all for the Game Wars

67
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,340
Game Wars. I'll say there's always, you know, big announcements Game Wars. There's still some big

68
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,860
game releases coming. You know, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is a huge release that a lot of people

69
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,100
are looking forward to. God of War Ragnarok is on the horizon. Although apparently it leaked. So look

70
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,740
out internet for spoilers because they're out there. So that's on the horizon. And of course,

71
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,420
this week Bayonetta 3, a game that was in the news a lot the last couple weeks, maybe not for the

72
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,580
reasons it wanted to be. But, you know, I won't get into that now. But I know a lot of people are

73
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,740
looking forward to Bayonetta 3 and that's finally out, you know, so so we are getting into that

74
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,460
time of year where all the games are releasing. But because of that, we just don't have a lot of

75
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,860
news about what the future holds as far as you know, games go. There's a few things here and

76
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,380
there. But I just noticed generally when I was, you know, looking at the show world tonight, in a

77
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,980
way I was kind of like, you know what, if Dark Sakura has to miss a week, I don't know if we had

78
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,180
enough stories for all three of us. If she was here this week, I'd be we'd be really, really

79
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:26,060
pushing it. But if you all have any, you know, questions, comments, tonight is the night for

80
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,780
tangent trains. So by all means, shout them out in our Twitch channel over twitch.tv slash vog

81
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,700
network. So yeah, and I see Fanara is in chat as well. I'm glad to see you're doing better Fanara

82
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:46,420
who's also kind of resting up right now. Fifth Dream in chat says OMG, less than three weeks to

83
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:54,780
Pokemon SV. I'm gonna pee. Now the question is Fifth Dream. Are you getting Pokemon S or Pokemon

84
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,540
V? And of course, I mean, are you getting scarlet?

85
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,820
Are you going number one? Are you going number two?

86
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,340
Maybe that'll be Gen 10. Pokemon poo and Pokemon pee.

87
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,340
They can't say pee and poo. They'll have to like come up with names that are not quite that but you

88
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,660
know.

89
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,140
Fifth Dream says violet all the way. You're not really a Pokemon person though. Are you Loki?

90
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:34,540
Casual like the last one I played was let's play Pikachu and me is it was okay. I finished it. My

91
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:41,300
son played the last one. And we'll probably get this one too. I buy him a lot of like the switch

92
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:50,100
games. I got him hooked on Enter the Gungeon though. I'm a good father. So you know, I was

93
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,340
pleased to see him playing that. But yeah, it also picked up since it's not my game week, it's his

94
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,020
picked up the new Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope game. So he's been playing that too.

95
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:08,340
Nice. All right, cool. Cool. Let's see. Also looking in our chat room at some other comments

96
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:14,740
here. Mike Deaf says I still haven't decided what version to get. Yeah, I was asked about it this

97
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:21,140
weekend, which one I'm getting. And I'm like, I think I'm getting Scarlet because like 90% of

98
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,180
people I know are getting Violet because of the hot professor. And I do appreciate a hot professor,

99
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,420
but I also appreciate having the version that has the exclusives everyone else wants. So I can be

100
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,420
popular. So I might get Pokemon Scarlet just for that reason. And actually I like the ghost dog.

101
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:43,460
I like the prehistoric professor too, to be honest. So no, I don't know who it is when you

102
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,980
say ghost dog. We still don't know the final Evos of the base Pokemon in the game. There's still a

103
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:55,140
lot to look forward to. Let's see. Jaskren in chat in response to the question which Pokemon version

104
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,980
are you getting says Pokemon gun. Remember those memes when we had Pokemon sword and shield and we

105
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,700
never got Pokemon gun? Where where that's a great goal. Where is Pokemon gun? It's just there. It's

106
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,140
not going to be Pokemon gun. It'll be Pokemon trebuchet. And it's just not out yet. They have

107
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:23,620
to do that. Let's see. I also E3VL in chat says I wish they stuck with one version like Arceus.

108
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,540
And I honestly, truth, I'm almost more excited about a sequel for that game. Well,

109
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,420
let's let's have an honest moment. I need to go back and beat that game. I was really into it.

110
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,300
And then the moving happened. You might remember that was right around the time of the year I moved

111
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:48,260
and I completely derailed from all of that. Okay, so I need to go back and finish Arceus at some

112
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:54,260
point. Um, I was hoping there would be some DLC or something that would motivate that but nope,

113
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,980
we never did get that. So I'm almost more excited about a sequel to that game than anything else.

114
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,420
Um, Mike Defton chat says we were just used to double dipping by by now with

115
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,940
Nintendo. It's just an acceptable thing that we allow. Mike Defton chat says we

116
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,100
already had our chance of Pokemon gun with fifth gen being based on the United States.

117
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,580
Oh, flow blow, but he can make that joke. He's in Mexico. I know that so he can make fun of us for

118
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:24,500
sure. And well, we never said it had to be Pokemon handgun. It could be Pokemon potato gun. You know,

119
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,300
there's a lot of different types of guns. So it could be Pokemon blow gun. Water got water pistol

120
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,300
emoji could be a lot of things. So Bobby Blackwolf chat says I'm sadly not interested in Scarlet

121
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,900
Violet. I did get sword and finished it. That's interesting to me, Bobby, because

122
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:48,500
I the amount that I loved sword and shield will shield specifically, and finish that

123
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:55,380
is like part of my big motivator why I'm so in on Scarlet and violet. And I can tell you how this is

124
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,860
different. So we all know my friend Shane, who frequently guests on this show and what a Pokemon

125
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:06,660
maniac he is right. You all know this, right? Here's the thing. Usually, for most Pokemon games,

126
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,340
Shane is having to say, Are you gonna get it? Are you gonna get it to be so cool? You got to get it

127
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,380
which version are you gonna get? Well, you should get this one because I'm getting this one. We can

128
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,140
trade to do that. Like usually he's having to do all that with the releases. I'm like, Alright,

129
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,020
fine. Yes. Yes. I'll get the Pokemon game. Yes. This time, he kind of started that same thing.

130
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,860
Like, hey, are you gonna get Pokemon Gen nine? I'm like, Yeah, I'm definitely getting it. I

131
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,900
definitely want to get Pokemon Scarlet. And I definitely want to play the game to completion.

132
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:35,380
And he's just kind of like, Oh, great. Yeah, cool. It's kind of like, wait, wait, you mean,

133
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,420
I don't need to convince you this time? It's like, no, I actually enjoyed the last gen of

134
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:46,260
Pokemon that all of the longtime fans seem to hate. I enjoyed it so much that I don't need

135
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,300
convincing to get the next gen. I want it because it's it's apparently more of the same formula.

136
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:58,340
So that's that. Bobby Blackwolf says I've already played a Pokemon on Switch. So not really looking

137
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:05,220
for more of the same. Oh, but have you played Pokemon on Switch? Oh, led. Well, so I just need

138
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,740
what I need to do is I clearly not need to just send Shane Bobby Blackwolf phone number. That's

139
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:21,860
what I need to do. All right. Anyway, all right. We got derailed from the kickoff topic gaming

140
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,340
lobbyists. Like I said, tonight's the night to get derailed. So let's get into the real kickoff

141
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,140
topic tonight. Loki, you want to take this on? It's about prices, right? The price is right. The

142
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:37,140
price is wrong. It's it's about just kind of the inevitability at some point. And it's not even

143
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:44,740
necessarily a confirmation of prices going up. But basically, you know, with Sony raising the price

144
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:52,340
of I don't know if they necessarily they had to raise the price of their games. But they did,

145
00:13:52,340 --> 00:14:00,660
because they they say it warranted $70, whatever. And of course, with like, say, the meta quest,

146
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,660
you know, to going up in price and stuff like that, stuff obviously is getting more expensive.

147
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:16,420
And according to Microsoft, you know, they spoke to was it Phil Spencer, who had said, you know,

148
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,860
we've held price on our console, we've held price on games and our subscriptions. I don't think

149
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,100
we'll be able to do that forever. I do think at some point, we'll have to raise some prices on

150
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:34,260
certain things, obviously, probably the subscriptions. But, I mean, it's not going to

151
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,060
happen this holiday, he says, obviously, I mean, obviously, and we're already in the holiday.

152
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,220
Makes perfect sense. So maybe next year, the prices will go up slightly. I mean, honestly,

153
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,260
if you think about it, though, like, when's the last time that they raised the cost of Game Pass

154
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,460
or Xbox Live or something like that? It's been a few years. And when you have like streaming

155
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,380
services, like, you know, Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, and stuff like that, I think raising the

156
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:06,260
prices, you know, at least once a year, I'm not surprised that this is going up. And it may even

157
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:13,300
be like a marginal thing. Will they raise the price of their games? Maybe if the market demand,

158
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,700
like if they're able to do that, like, I don't think a lot of game companies are doing it.

159
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:25,060
It's basically Activision. I don't know if EA is selling their games for $70. I hope not,

160
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:31,780
because it's not worth it. And Sony. I mean, those are the three that I can think of that are

161
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:40,500
selling their games for $70. And sometimes I think that's warranted. Like, I was some of the,

162
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,620
you know, first party Sony games, I could see how they could get away with that. Call of Duty

163
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,460
Modern Warfare 2, probably not. They're probably not worth $70. I don't see the value there.

164
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:58,660
But I guess we'll have to see. Definitely not Madden, but Madden was sold, I think,

165
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:05,220
for $70. That's certainly not worth it. So it's just a matter of what the consumers will pay for.

166
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,940
I mean, and I get it that they're saying that things are getting more expensive,

167
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,860
but I don't buy that. Like, I get it that you can charge more upfront for it, but you're also,

168
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,820
you know, charging on the back end with all these game passes and season passes and DLC and all

169
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,620
this stuff that's shoved in there. And a lot of times game mechanics built around just all

170
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,780
of this stuff in the first place. So even though, like, people like to make the stupid argument and

171
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:34,180
the wrong argument that, oh, games have never been cheaper. That's not true, because when I

172
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,780
was buying a game back in 2005 for the Xbox 360, they didn't really have a ton of DLC or anything

173
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:47,060
like that available at the time. And certainly no game passes. So when you're getting a $60 game,

174
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,180
it was pretty much complete. You would have some bug fixes every now and then, but it certainly

175
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,580
wouldn't be this game comes out. Oh, hey, it's half finished. Let's have a roadmap of how we're

176
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,460
going to complete our game. It's like, well, you know, perhaps you should have finished it before

177
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:07,940
you sold it. I mean, that's how it used to be. So yes, things will probably get more expensive. But

178
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,660
at the same time, you know what, though, like one thing we are hearing from just the general public

179
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:19,060
is, yeah, everything's getting more expensive, but you know what's not going up my salary.

180
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,260
And so you can charge more for those games, but less people are going to buy it. And eventually,

181
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,460
what you're going to get is you're going to get it's going to move towards piracy is going to be

182
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,380
what's going to happen with all these different streaming services splitting off with their own

183
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,420
content. All these game companies, you know, charging more for their games when their games

184
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:44,580
come out and they're unfinished and just buggy as hell or just a mess. Yeah, people are going

185
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:51,300
to lose trust in you and they're just going to move to piracy. But I mean, do whatever you think

186
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,060
is good for your company. It just doesn't necessarily mean everybody's going to follow suit

187
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,140
with that. Well, and with multiplayer games being as popular as they are, that's going to be a very

188
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,420
hard thing to pirate. I mean, they always have been because the minute those things talk to the

189
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,140
servers, they're going to be able to suss out if it's a pirate version or not. So you know, which

190
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,660
is also why a lot of single player games were having multiplayer elements for some time and

191
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,220
still continue to. So by the way, I just want to point out Bobby Blackwell researched your EA

192
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:22,740
question and points out that FIFA 23 is $70 on Steam. I can guarantee that's not worth it. Not

193
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:29,460
worth it on Steam on Steam. Come on. Like, console, you might be able to get away with that on PC.

194
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,460
Are you serious? Like, I don't. Please don't buy the game for $70. It is not worth $70.

195
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:43,140
I guarantee you it's mostly recycled from last year. I, again, I'm sympathetic to the game.

196
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,940
I mean, like, I'm not saying I love the idea of the games going up to $70. But like, I understand

197
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,100
it, especially as we're sitting here going, you know, we just had a big debate on the show a

198
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,220
couple weeks ago and across the entire internet about our voice actors being paid enough, right?

199
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,820
We just went through that whole thing. And I realized that voice actors, you know, need to

200
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,100
make more money. And that money's got to come from somewhere. And I realized the people working and

201
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,940
making the games should have a good quality life. And that money's got to come from somewhere.

202
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:14,020
However, and I want to make this clear, I think the executive salaries are where a good chunk of

203
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,420
that ought to come from. I know it won't because that's just the way society works.

204
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,380
And I would totally make that argument for like, a lot of other games, maybe Sony might be a good

205
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,660
argument for that $70. And you know, whereas a lot of other games are really well polished when they

206
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,460
come out. And God of War Ragnarok is excellent game is going to be it's going to be hard to

207
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:39,060
argue that God of War Ragnarok is not worth $70. Like apparently, it's 50 solid hours of gameplay.

208
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:45,780
It's not a game that's going to be loaded up with, you know, cosmetic packs and all this BS. Like

209
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,020
God of War Ragnarok, I think is a good example of a game that can get away with charging $70. And

210
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:55,380
it's hard to complain about it. Yeah. Whereas EA is recycling the game that they had from last year,

211
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,580
adding minimal features to it and making billions of dollars off of micro transactions from their

212
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,220
FIFA Ultimate Team series. So don't give me Oh, they're there. I'm sure that all those people

213
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,100
that work for EA are probably starving and stuff like that, because they're not being paid enough.

214
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,020
But it's not because they don't have the money to do it. They have so much money that they don't

215
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,340
even know what to do with yet it can't. No amount of money they seem to throw at their game can't

216
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,060
make it good. So I don't know what the problem is there. They just probably don't care. Because

217
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,740
even if they just turn out the same crap as last year, they'll still make billions of dollars. So

218
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,860
the the the community has spoken, we will buy whatever crap you put out,

219
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,860
no matter for how much you charge for it. And we'll pay even more money on the back end,

220
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:44,020
because we got to have our FIFA Ultimate Team. We're, you know, I, we keep having this discussion

221
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,940
about the $70 game, the $70 game. And I think the reality is, there are so many ways to price a game

222
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,860
now in 2022. That like, I think the $70 game is sort of like, it's just this weird, like,

223
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:01,140
it's an option. But it's not like where all of the games are going. For example, Overwatch 2,

224
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,620
25 million people are playing Overwatch 2, that is technically a free game. But we all know it's

225
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,620
free with a giant asterisk if you want to get any of the cool stuff. Same thing with something like

226
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,980
Fortnite, which is one of the biggest games in the galaxy right now. Free with an asterisk. Pokemon Go

227
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,260
free with an asterisk. Like that's another way to price games. You can do monthly subscription.

228
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,500
It doesn't work for a lot of games, but Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft, say hello.

229
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,900
You can do, you know, the monthly subscription type of model. You can do a cheap, you can do a

230
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:38,340
hybrid. You can do a cheap as fuck base game that is then loaded with, you know, um, maybe not like

231
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:44,020
a ton, like, like just a lot of add-ons. Dead by Daylight is a great example of that. $20 game,

232
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:49,380
loaded with add-ons that are, that it's hard to say aren't, you know, that don't bring value.

233
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,100
They do, but there's, you know, just a lot. Fifth Dream in chat says, why food games are

234
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,100
technically free, but cost deliver in your soul to play as well. I believe you're talking about

235
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,420
Genshin Impact, which is free with an asterisk. So again, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just pointing out

236
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,740
$70 is like, we keep saying the, the industry says the industry is not all on a $70 game.

237
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,860
The reality is there are all sorts of pricing now in the industry and you have to decide,

238
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,180
is it worth it or is it not? How bad do you want to play the game?

239
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,060
That's my point is they make the, the argument that they're making that they say they justify

240
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:30,420
$70 is the quality of the game. So I better see the quality of that game when you're charging $70

241
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:37,860
for it. And the problem is it, the quality doesn't, it's not an upgrade from a $60 game.

242
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:43,780
The same with FIFA. Like when it was a $50 game and went to a $60 game,

243
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,540
it didn't increase in quality. It's the same stuff they've been pulling for years,

244
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:55,780
and it's just ridiculous. Sony can charge $70 for a game and it's easier to digest because

245
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,260
their quality is there. If you can see the quality in their work.

246
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:06,340
Quite honestly, if Final Fantasy 16 were $99 and 99 cents, I would probably still be buying it.

247
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,740
Well, I mean, that's fine, whatever you find value in, you know, with that. But I,

248
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:18,260
I think it's ridiculous, but you know, to that point though, you know, we look at the cost of

249
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:23,620
games, but that's not how necessarily we are digesting these games as well. So like, for

250
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,620
example, there's X-Box game pass. So, you know, that they're seeing right now is accounting for

251
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:37,860
15% of Microsoft's gaming revenue as of right now. I'm kind of surprised it's that low to be honest,

252
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:44,420
but then I think about the globe. I think about the globe and I wonder, is that 15% globally or

253
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:49,060
15% in the US? Because I bet it would be higher if you were to look at the US only, but if it's

254
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,780
globally, I sort of understand why there's a lot of countries around the world that probably are

255
00:23:53,780 --> 00:24:00,180
still on physical media and not ready to have the network infrastructure to download a ton, a ton of

256
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,140
games through something like game pass. So that's kind of where the 15% makes more sense to me is on

257
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:13,860
a global level. And they're saying that it's not necessarily expected to increase either. They're

258
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:20,020
saying, I don't think it's going to get bigger than that. I think the overall revenue grows. So

259
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,700
15% of a bigger number, but we don't have this future where I think 50 to 70% of our revenue

260
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,500
comes from subscriptions. That's interesting. Well, maybe in a future where games are 70 and

261
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:37,780
$80, that might be a better deal because we don't have rental services anymore.

262
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,980
I haven't paid full price for a Microsoft game in five years because I've been on game pass

263
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:48,420
and I don't have to. But since we've been talking about price increase, price increase,

264
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,340
we talk about subscription prices going up and game pass is highly likely to go up.

265
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,620
Just a word of advice. Again, everybody's financial situation is different. So not everybody

266
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,180
may be in a position where they can do this, but I would just kind of plant the seed of,

267
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,380
if you can do this, I would highly advise you with Black Friday on the horizon.

268
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,380
We know we're going to see some deep discounts. We almost always around this time of year around

269
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:18,020
the holiday, see some type of discount on PlayStation network, as well as Xbox game pass.

270
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:23,700
If you can, I would load up on a year or even two, whatever you can afford and kind of like

271
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,380
lock in your rate because it's inevitable that those are going to go up and you'll probably

272
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,380
be able to get a lower rate because of Black Friday sales. There might be limitations and

273
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,100
weird things like that, but I would, and again, I'm talking about you dropping a couple hundred

274
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,300
dollars at once, which is certainly not feasible for everyone. If your situation calls for it

275
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,300
though, and you sort of know like I'm in it for the long haul with game pass, that's me.

276
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,220
I'm in it for the long haul with game pass. I know I will be on game pass for a very long time.

277
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,660
So I'm going to be looking around to probably load up on two or three years of game pass.

278
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,380
And I know a lot of you out there loaded up a lot of game pass. Bobby Black Wolf confirms

279
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,780
you can only front load up to three years of game pass, but you still can. And I think the

280
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:14,740
clock is running out for many of you that got that three years right out the gate. I think what 2023,

281
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,340
maybe 2024 for some of you, but I think 2023 is about where that clock is going to end for

282
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,700
many of you. Um, so you might want to load up on another three years. It just, it just, I mean,

283
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,300
again, it depends on your situation. Um, but I would just think about that as an option.

284
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,540
If you are a heavy game pass user or PlayStation network, to be quite honest,

285
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,140
I'm sure those prices will go up as well eventually. Maybe not as fast, but eventually

286
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,580
just something to think about. All right. Uh, let's take a moment to talk a little bit about

287
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,500
our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week on

288
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,860
X-Box or otherwise. So, uh, dark soccer is not joining us tonight. Uh, but I will start with

289
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:02,980
Loki then play Minecraft. It's I know shocking, shocking. Um, we live stream last night too.

290
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,780
I forgot to post up about that. I was in, um, I was just saying, I didn't see that.

291
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,220
It wasn't me streaming, but it was, it was a server made this streaming.

292
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:21,060
I was participating with that. Um, but yeah, I did a, a rather, it's a semi-large build

293
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:27,380
that will be in a next episode here. Hopefully very soon. Um, I was trying to get back down

294
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,060
the weekly. It's been two weeks already, but we're not going to make it four weeks. So

295
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,100
we'll get there. It's just, I have the, some editing stuff I got to do.

296
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,540
We said it's another big build like your, um, Mega Man.

297
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,220
Not that big. No, not as big as the octopus. That that that's ridiculous. No,

298
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,820
regular, regular large bills. Okay. Ridiculous. Like 200,000 partially ridiculous.

299
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,700
No, it looks nice. It's really cool. It's the centerpiece of one of the,

300
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:00,660
the robot masters areas. So it's, um, pretty cool looking. And it actually is from

301
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,780
Mega Man as well. It's from a game I haven't played. Um, it's a Mega Man zero two, but

302
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,540
it's a, it's a giant tree. All right. But yeah, that's, that's pretty much it.

303
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,140
Uh, let's see my gaming week. Um, yeah, I was a little busy with like show hosting this weekend

304
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,140
and stuff. So, um, I haven't had as much time for games. So I have been playing dead by daylight.

305
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,540
I streamed a little bit about that the other night, um, because they are doing a big, uh,

306
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,460
blood point push in the game right now. So just, you know, uh, I've been working on

307
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:37,700
prestiging more survivors. So I prestiged both Kate and somebody else this last week. Was it

308
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,020
Nia? No, I think it was somebody else, but yeah, I prestiged two more survivors this last week.

309
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,580
Uh, Oh, Elodie, I think was one of them that I prestiged. So, um, I'm, I'm just working on trying

310
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,060
to prestige all the survivors. Uh, maybe I'll play killer at some point, but the game has been in

311
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,500
this weird place where the survivors have been getting all the bonuses now in the shorter queue

312
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,780
times. Whereas six months ago, it was, uh, very different. So, uh, I've been working on that,

313
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:05,060
uh, still playing Final Fantasy 14. I still am obsessed with the farming sim mode in that game,

314
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,780
the island sanctuary. I now have earned every single cosmetic that you can get right now in

315
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:15,540
the island sanctuary. And so what I'm doing, I am just stockpiling the currency to just instantly

316
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,860
buy whatever's next. When they put out the new content, I'm hoping they don't outsmart me and

317
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,940
make it a different currency. I'm really frightened. They're going to do that so that I save up like

318
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,820
200,000 of the island calories and then I can't even use them or I can always buy materia or

319
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,300
something with them, but we'll see. So that's going on. Um, SSG100 Matt in chat says gaming

320
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,620
week Overwatch 2 with a new Junkenstein event going on. I actually did check that out as well.

321
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:43,460
I, I haven't played a lot of Overwatch 2, but I did the new Junkenstein event just once just to,

322
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,620
you know, say that I did it and pick up the easy cosmetics and whatever battle pass points,

323
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,020
whatever you, I'm thinking my battle pass like level 11. I've barely played any Overwatch, but

324
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,300
I've done, I've done a little bit. Yeah. I also noticed, uh, that the skill like it,

325
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,100
this one is harder than the last one was, uh, the, the original event that's, you know,

326
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,060
several years old at this point, you can still play the original if you want to,

327
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,580
that's still in the game. But yeah, the new one was harder because you had to, you know,

328
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:13,940
go exploring and it's not always obvious where you need to go is, is a little more challenging. So,

329
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,940
um, I've also been playing that. Um, but otherwise I didn't really dabble in anything new this week,

330
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:26,020
to be honest. Um, just kind of the old reliables, uh, until, uh, probably, probably it'll stay that

331
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,340
way until maybe Pokemon Scarlet and violet. I do kind of want to pick up bandana three. I just,

332
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,700
I don't know if I have the time, but my, my hosting and weekend stuff clears up significantly next

333
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,860
month. So, um, I'll have a little more time for games at that point. Um, I, we're not going to be

334
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,780
here on OLR. At least I won't be, I, I don't know if Loki at our cyber want to do something, but I

335
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,180
won't be here in two weeks, uh, veterans day weekend because I'll be out on vacation and kind

336
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:57,300
of like after that point, I get freed up a lot. So, um, I'll have more time to sink into catching

337
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:05,460
up on backlog games and the games that come out, uh, this, this, uh, over the next, uh, few weeks.

338
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,700
And so the holiday releases, uh, quest buster and chat says, I'm having a lot of fun with bandana

339
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,260
three. Uh, me, she says, I'm hoping to get two copies of bandana three for shits and giggles,

340
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:20,420
digital and physical, uh, Jaskren and chat says gaming week, mass effect. One first time play

341
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,060
through all on the steam deck. Uh, yeah, that's cool. I'm assuming that's like the legendary

342
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,380
edition. Maybe that's neat. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says I'm considering getting bandana three

343
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,180
because I was told you don't really have to have played two to understand it. I played one when it

344
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,260
originally came out, but it's been a while. I am also under that understanding that number three,

345
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,700
you don't need to know the first two games that well to understand. So you don't, you don't need

346
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,060
a deep understanding of those. So that's pretty cool. So we'll see. Oh yeah. No man's sky. I have

347
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,740
been dabbling in that game a little bit as well. I see you all know that I play that game way too

348
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:59,620
much, but it's, I love the new relaxed modes. I really do. So good times. All right. Let's get

349
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:05,220
into some more gaming news and what's going on throughout the industry. What little there is a

350
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:11,140
lot of updates on other stories, but, uh, Loki, what do you have for us? It's hard to keep track

351
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,580
of all these different lawsuits, but this is going hearkening back to the first lawsuit for

352
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:23,300
Activision Blizzard regarding the poor treatment of their employees. Um, so this is from the

353
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:28,820
California civil rights department, which was previously known as the California department

354
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:35,860
of fair employment and housing. Um, so they're basically, uh, Activision is trying to get the

355
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:43,140
case thrown out again, basically saying that because of these, the cases, because of this

356
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:53,620
case, they have suffered, um, bad PR, I guess it is, it is, um, is tarnished their reputation,

357
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:03,620
uh, of a company that's about to get acquired. I'm sorry that your reputation is tarnished because

358
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:09,380
people found out that you harassed your employees. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, but that's what they're trying

359
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:16,660
to make the argument. I don't think, Oh, obviously it's, it's not succeeding, but yep. So Activision

360
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:25,060
was like the truth hurts. And for that reason, we shouldn't be sued. Uh, but yeah, so the case

361
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:32,020
is still moving ahead. It is supposed to take place, um, into 2023, I think at some point.

362
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:38,500
All right. That's going to be interesting to see how that's timed with the merger. If the merger

363
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,020
is allowed to go through, a lot of people think that Europe is going to shut down that merger and

364
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,660
it may not actually happen. That could be very interesting. So be interesting. I would, I would

365
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,980
be curious if Microsoft might try to buy a part of Activision Blizzard, if that gets stopped,

366
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:56,420
like Microsoft's like, we'll just take Blizzard. Thanks. Right. It's kind of weird though. Like I

367
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:01,860
especially find it funny when we hear about Sony making the argument that, Oh, they'll have an

368
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:09,060
unfair advantage with exclusives. It's like, dude, you do the same thing. Shut the hell up.

369
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,940
Like, can you, this is literally your game plan. Well, they're doing it too. Now it's not fair.

370
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:22,420
We want to do it first. I don't know. Corporations got to hate him.

371
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:30,100
All right. Uh, well earlier in the show I had brought up Genshin impact. Um, this is,

372
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,060
I tried Genshin impact. I gotta be honest. I couldn't get into it,

373
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,740
but I know a lot of people love this game. They love Genshin impact and they play the

374
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:43,460
shit out of this game. Uh, unfortunately Genshin impact has had a bit of a data breach,

375
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:50,340
uh, that has happened. Um, and so, uh, people's, uh, information could be at risk. So I hope you

376
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:56,500
all are changing your passwords. That's for sure. Uh, let's see. I want to mention, uh,

377
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:02,740
what is happening here. Unfortunately, the first thing I tried to go to the site wouldn't work.

378
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:08,420
So I'm trying to quickly get into an alternate site that talks about what's happening here.

379
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:18,980
Um, all right. Sorry. All earlier this week, uh, Genshin impact, uh, HoYo verse had a data breach

380
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,380
and big batches of information were shared online to talk about the details of new characters,

381
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:30,580
quests, and events from 3.3 until 3.8. Uh, there were DMCA strike to poach that came out of the

382
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:35,940
data breach. Uh, so, uh, you know, you never know what's going to change there. Uh, although, uh,

383
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,660
one of the leakers on Twitter had a change of heart saying after further consideration with

384
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,460
friends, I decided to remove all my tweets from today just to be safe to make it clear.

385
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,620
I do not condone what other methods in which the data was obtained and I was not involved in

386
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:56,180
obtaining nor distributing the original data. Um, uh, apparently, uh, 36 weeks of content,

387
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,300
uh, that is coming out for the game. We're all impacted by the breach and this information.

388
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:06,100
Um, so to correct something I said a moment ago, I apologize, but no, uh, usernames and passwords

389
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:11,860
have been put at risk yet, but I would say the logic says if they got in there and looked at

390
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:16,900
some of this stuff, they probably got access to other stuff too. That's just not being acknowledged

391
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,940
yet. So I would say, you know what, change your passwords anyway. I had a good habit.

392
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:28,260
It's a good thing to do. And then quest buster says that, uh, it was, uh, some QA and employee

393
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,100
info that was included in that as well. What was taken out from that. So, um, Bobby Blackwolf does

394
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,740
say I never gave a username and password to them. It was attached to my PSN account. So hopefully

395
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,980
for most people that did a type of link thing, it would be okay, but I'm sure there are people that

396
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,900
have an account directly through the company as well. Um, possibly playing on PC or something. So

397
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,220
it would be good to stay on top of that information. Uh, it is interesting though

398
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,740
that most like web browsers and stuff will now tell you if a password was in a data leak. Have

399
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,820
you, have you seen this? And like, I don't, I think Chrome does it. And I think, uh, some of

400
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,740
the others do too, maybe edge, but like when you try to use a password on a website, if it's

401
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:11,620
something that was in a data breach, it actually pops up and says this password was found in a data

402
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,180
breach. You shouldn't use it. So it's interesting that it compares all that right out the gate.

403
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,020
Try it, try it next time you sign up for a website, just put your password in as password,

404
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,660
don't save it, but just put, put in something silly, uh, and, and see how the alert comes up.

405
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,380
Bobby Blackwolf says Firefox does it too. I think that's very interesting how, um, they will help

406
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:35,940
people, uh, not pick, uh, bad passwords in that regard. So remember use, use mixed words,

407
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,820
mixed case, mixed letters, jumbles, punctuation numbers, uh, all that goes a long way. Don't use

408
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,460
the name of pets, or if you are going to use the name of the pet, combine it with other things that

409
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:55,860
don't make sense. Do your favorite pet, favorite food, you know, favorite cousin with, uh, some

410
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,580
random capitalization and some numbers of significance to you. Uh, or Jaskren in chat

411
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:05,060
says use a password manager. Absolutely. Uh, then you only have to remember one password,

412
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,100
which is still sometimes a challenge for me. That's for sure. The password managers, man,

413
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,820
they're, they're sure helping us. Every website now is like, you have to have a minimum of eight

414
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,500
characters to this website. For this website, you have to have a minimum of eight, but no more than

415
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,620
20, but you have to have at least one that's a punctuation and you can use numbers, but you can't

416
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:29,460
use the number three. It's like every website has their own wild rules to them. So, uh, yeah,

417
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,660
password managers are great. That's for sure. All right, moving on. Uh, this is very interesting

418
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:41,140
about where the industry is headed, right? Um, yeah, well, it it's, I don't know if it's

419
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:47,540
unexpected because we've seen this before with different games having partial or parts of their

420
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,260
game that, well, it's kind of actually the opposite. So you may remember a while back,

421
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:58,180
we had the whole issue where DLC was on the disc and people were upset about that. Well, what if

422
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:04,260
the DLC isn't on the disc and the game isn't on the disc as well? The disc is just, I guess the

423
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:13,540
memento, a memento with a key to go download the game. Um, but yes. Yes. Um, so modern warfare two,

424
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:21,220
uh, the Blu-ray disc that they have contained 72 megs of data. That's like enough to fit on AC

425
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:28,740
ROM. Um, not even on a Blu-ray. I don't know why they pressed it onto a Blu-ray disc, but they did.

426
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:34,020
And it allows it's basically forcing players to connect to the internet and download a hundred

427
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,700
plus gigabytes of data. So that's great. So like, even though you didn't want to buy the

428
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:45,540
game digitally because, Hey, I have bandwidth caps and I can't really do that. Activision says,

429
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:51,140
you know what? We don't care what you like. You paid $70 for a game. So you get to pay

430
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:57,380
those overdraft fees or whatever for going over your bandwidth caps. It's it's the Activision gift

431
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:03,700
that keeps on giving. And so you're going to have to download all of that data for the game. Um,

432
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:11,940
I guess to protect from spoilers or something. Well, I mean the God award team like literally

433
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,340
tweeted earlier. So what are the reps literally tweeted earlier today? I kind of wish we'd gone

434
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:22,020
this route because now a retailer leaked their game two weeks early and all of the spoilers

435
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:27,460
are out there now. That's a problem though. And I could definitely speak to this. Uh,

436
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,940
that's a problem because you ship your stuff too early to mass market retailers

437
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,020
is the problem. And, and the, all the time people always are going to get accused like

438
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:42,740
the small mom and pop shops of breaking street dates to, um, get a competitive advantage over

439
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:48,980
their competitors. And they do. But the thing is though, is those mom and pop stores aren't buying

440
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:55,060
direct from Activision. They are buying from a distributor who doesn't even get the copies of

441
00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:01,220
the game until like the week of, and barely gets them to them by street date. So it's leaking two

442
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:08,180
weeks early. It's because the dumb assholes at Activision decided to ship the game that early.

443
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:14,100
So you have yourself to blame, or in this case it would be Sony. You have yourself to blame

444
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:20,100
for shipping it that early. That's your own damn fault. Sorry, but it is if you didn't send out

445
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:29,460
the door, can't get leaked. Um, but in this case, so this is absolutely stupid. Once again, $70 game

446
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,980
and you're making me download the whole game. Why, why even make a physical version of it?

447
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,500
What is the point? This sucks for game preservation as well, because

448
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:45,060
when Activision inevitably takes down the server, how am I going to get my game? You know, like it

449
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:50,500
in the future, it's just awful. Um, Bobby, Bobby lack of in chat does have a good point about the,

450
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,340
because you had said, you know, why even bother with a Blu-ray when it's the size can fit on a

451
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:59,220
CD. Uh, they press it that way because Xbox and PS five can't play games off a DVD or CD,

452
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,420
which makes sense. I mean, they might be able to read them to play the music or the movie,

453
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,140
but they're not trained to boot games off of them. I get that. I mean, basically,

454
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:14,020
but why, like, I would just put card in the box at this point. Like what's the point? Like, I mean,

455
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:20,900
seriously that like, what's the point anyways, for this, I guess. So I don't even know.

456
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:29,700
It's just dumb. Yeah. I, I, I, you know, with a game like call of duty specifically,

457
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,980
I know that a big chunk of that is multiplayer and you're going to have to be online for

458
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:42,660
multiplayer anyway. So I'm kind of like, I'm not, I'm not like surprised that like, you have to be

459
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,020
online to download all the patches and all the things like that. And that, you know, you're not

460
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,820
going to get a lot of play off the disc. Although I know, yes, there is a single player campaign to

461
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:56,180
as well. I know, but I know a lot of people play a multiplayer, but I also, you know, I'm also

462
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,580
spoiled now with lack of bandwidth caps. And that's something that was strongly something

463
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:05,220
that affected me, you know, six months ago. And this would tick me off because a big reason why

464
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,900
I would buy things physically was because I don't want to download like 80 gigabytes. And that's

465
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:16,500
what pissed me off about legendary edition. Or just like even, even just think about your

466
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,020
customer. I mean, obviously they're not thinking about the customer. They could, they see them as a

467
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,340
wallet, so it doesn't matter. They don't think of them as people, but like, aside from that,

468
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,820
so not only am I going to now have to like, say I bought this day one or whatever, midnight launch

469
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:36,740
or whatever, even if they do that anymore, I'm going to go home and I can't play the game because

470
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:45,220
I have to download 100 gigabytes for this. And, and the latest patch that they have, it's reported,

471
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:51,460
it's over 150 gigabytes large when you include the campaign and multiplayer. So not only am I

472
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,380
going to download the game, but then if it patches again, I'm gonna have to download another hundred,

473
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,660
some gigs. Do they not know the reality that we live in? People have bandwidth caps. It's,

474
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:07,460
we don't live in a gigabit world where everybody has lightning fast, you know, fiber internet and

475
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,620
can just download whatever because they have unlimited data caps. If we lived in that world,

476
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,740
this would be no problem whatsoever, but we don't live in that world. And it doesn't work. What

477
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,980
about here's a weird idea. What about somebody that doesn't have a great internet connection?

478
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,380
So they're downloading it two megabits per second, or they're downloading it at, you know,

479
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:33,540
DSL speeds or something like that. Well, I hope you can, I guess I'll play it next weekend when

480
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:38,020
it's done downloading. I mean, like a lot of military guys and gals like to play this game.

481
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,340
And, uh, the internet connection is usually pretty shitty, uh, overseas. So.

482
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:51,860
It is just such, it's so cell science. Like what, what costs can we cut so that we make more money?

483
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:56,980
So the shareholders make more money is all that they, that's all they look at. They don't care

484
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:03,220
about the quality of the game. It's just about how much money we can make. Um, Bobby was some

485
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:08,180
more points in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And, you know, I do see this side

486
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:13,380
of this, um, saying the disc is the key to unlock the game as well. It needs to be in the console.

487
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,700
You can still resell the disc and you won't be able to play it without the disc. This means the

488
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,180
resale market is still available for this game and the code, et cetera. It doesn't work that way. It

489
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:28,500
does. And I will say to that, you know, comments credit, it does put aside one of my big problems

490
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,980
with, you know, buying digital versus buying physical is that when you buy a game digital,

491
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,540
you can't resell it. It has no equity. It doesn't have any type of collectible value,

492
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:42,100
essentially, unless you're into digital collectibles, which, you know, um, I would

493
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:47,140
say the mass market, when you look at things like NFTs is rejecting, um, you know, digital

494
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:53,940
collectibles. So we've seen many stories about how, uh, the game industry specifically, they've

495
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:59,620
been trying to make NFTs the next big thing and the, the, the gamers are rejecting it, which I

496
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:04,260
appreciate and so forth. But my point is, is that, you know, because I like having those

497
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:10,180
physical collectibles, at least as much as this method sucks, it does still play into the old

498
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:16,260
system of the disc is the game and you can resell that and it has value, blah, blah, blah, blah,

499
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,020
you know? So that part of it I get, but if I had a bandwidth cap, I'd be pissed.

500
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:26,820
Yeah, but it's not $70 anymore because now you're caught, you're charging me the electricity to

501
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:32,420
download the thing. You're charging me the bandwidth I have, so possibly exceeding it.

502
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:39,220
You are costing me more time because I anticipated to be able to play this after,

503
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:45,460
you know, obviously downloading an update patch, which is fine. You know, it's acceptable at this

504
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:51,380
point. So it's, it's a lot more than $70 at this point. And then they're probably going to shove

505
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:58,420
microtransactions and DLC and battle passes and all that other crap down your throat.

506
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:05,860
So like, I don't feel bad when they say, Oh, we're charging $70 for our game and people don't want

507
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:09,620
to buy it. I mean, people are still going to buy it because there are people that will just buy

508
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:16,340
Call of Duty every year. It doesn't matter what they put out. But whatever. I mean, it's

509
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:25,220
people, what I think it's upsetting about this is that people probably who are buying this don't

510
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:29,060
know this until they've already bought it. It's not like something that they disclose like, Hey,

511
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:35,940
you're gonna have to download. Well, it may be in tiny ass fucking print on the back of the box.

512
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,820
requires internet, will you and that requires internet connection to download full game or

513
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,300
something like that. It'll be in tiny ass fucking print on the back of the box.

514
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,940
I think they should at least put like the campaign on there or something like that.

515
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,700
They've done that in the past where the multiplayer is, you know,

516
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,820
later on, because the servers will come online later or something like that you download it

517
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:03,540
later. And I think that's somewhat acceptable, because then at least I'm not having to spend

518
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,660
as much of my data as I would if I was to buy digitally. But once again, it's like,

519
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,140
why buy it physically? And then I get it. Yeah, you can resell it later on. But do really people

520
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:22,660
hassle with that. I don't know if a lot of people do anymore. Like, it's trading is not worth it.

521
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:29,860
And to sell it online. Sure, you can do it. But is a hassle. So I don't know. I don't think I don't

522
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:36,900
know if the use market is really what it used to be. But well, Activision sucks. What are you

523
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:44,020
gonna do? Bobby says the PS five version has requires content download in small print on the

524
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:50,660
bottom of the front of the box. So it's there, but it's, it's easily missable. Yeah, but most

525
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,460
people don't mean that it's like, like content download, you may think, oh, that that means a

526
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:59,860
part of the game. It doesn't mean the whole game. Like, I don't know. It's not. It's not

527
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:05,380
specifically say, you will have to download this whole game. Like, and that's, I don't know,

528
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,540
whatever. Who cares? I'm not the target demographic for this at the moment. So it's fine.

529
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,620
All right. Well, let's move on and talk about orange right in chat says it should be as obvious

530
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,100
as those switch games that don't even have the game card in it. Well, speaking of the switch,

531
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:29,220
you can now use those controllers on various Apple devices. There was an update that will now use

532
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,060
allow the Apple devices to use the classic controllers from the Nintendo switch.

533
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:38,900
So you can use the N 64 classic controller, you can use that Sega Mega Drive Genesis classic

534
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,900
controller, you can use the Super Nintendo classic controller, the NES classic controller,

535
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:49,860
and you can use them with any device that runs either Mac OS 13, iOS 16, TV OS 16. So you know,

536
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:56,340
pretty much, you know, any Apple device in the last couple years, the joy cons and switch pro

537
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:01,940
controller that was already there. This is something for those, you know, special unique

538
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:08,020
controllers, but also pretty cool. Like, you know, I know people have, you know, snuck in some

539
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:14,100
emulation sometimes onto the Apple system. So those controllers can come in handy if you're

540
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:19,780
managed to grab some of those things before they got pulled. Or, you know, even with retro inspired

541
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:25,700
games, having these classic controllers can be a lot of fun, that's for sure. Also worth pointing

542
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,620
out, you can also if you don't, if you don't want to use Nintendo controllers, you can still use

543
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:34,420
Xbox series controllers, the dual sense, you can use a dual shock, you can go back and use an Xbox

544
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:40,260
one controller. There are a lot of other devices that will work with the Apple devices. But

545
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:48,820
interestingly enough, still no official Apple joystick. They tout a lot of compatibility with

546
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:53,860
third party devices, but never an official one, which is just interesting. Unless I guess you

547
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:59,060
count maybe the remote for the TV, but I don't really count that. Just it's always interesting

548
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:04,980
to me how for whatever reason, they haven't really looked behind that rock. I'm just surprised

549
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,940
because it would be very easy to make a shell that the phone could snap into and it would be a lot

550
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:14,900
like a switch. But maybe because there's varying sizes of phones, I don't know. But I would think

551
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:20,420
you could have a stretchy thing. But I guess it's whatever they don't want to do it. So

552
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:28,660
but a lot of people own a Nintendo switch or one of those many other devices I just named that it

553
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:34,020
also works with. So that is something you can do. Bobby Blackwell also points out anything's

554
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:41,140
possible with 3d printers. It's true. It's true. All right. Let's move on. We have some more

555
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:48,740
stories. Let's get to Loki. Yeah, so there's this game called the stores closed, which is an SCP

556
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:56,660
infinite store survival game. So basically, it's this big procedurally generated

557
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:06,660
furniture store. The problem is that the outside of the store has yellow lettering against a solid

558
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:14,580
blue store. And so IKEA believes it looks like it looks too much like IKEA. And clearly, I mean,

559
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,020
I think it's supposed to be slightly inspired by IKEA, but it's not supposed to be IKEA.

560
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:25,300
It's more of like kind of the joke where you can wander through IKEA and kind of get lost a little

561
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:29,940
bit, because they're really big and winding stores. True. So I think that's where they've

562
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:35,060
kind of taken the inspiration from it. But the game itself looks pretty cool. You actually are

563
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:40,260
like trapped inside the store and you have to avoid the staff who turn into giant monsters at

564
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:48,820
night. And then you build of bases or forts out of the furniture. Which I love that. It's like

565
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:55,220
it's got like, yeah, you forever end up having to live in a 310 square foot space, like the

566
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:01,060
models in IKEA, you know, show you how here's how to live within 400 square feet or whatever,

567
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,340
you know, you know, yeah, it's like that. But so yeah, they're basically there's a lawyer from

568
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:14,260
IKEA had contacted them saying that they need to stop infringing on IKEA stores. They said that

569
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:19,220
our client has learned that you're developing a video game the store is closed, which uses

570
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:24,180
without our clients authorization indica associated with the famous IKEA stores.

571
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:29,860
So blue and yellow, I guess the blue the game uses a blue and yellow sign with a

572
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:36,820
Scandinavian name on the outside or on the store on a blue box like building yellow vertical

573
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:42,180
stripes shirts identical to those worn by IKEA personnel. A great path on the floor furniture

574
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,260
looks like IKEA furniture into which is funny though because the developers like I just bought

575
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:54,260
a I just bought a cheap furniture pack on like the unity assets store for this. This is all

576
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:01,300
foregoing or they're basically saying all foregoing immediate suggests that the game

577
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:08,180
takes place in an IKEA store. Like unfortunately, he's probably gonna have to change the way like

578
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,700
the outside of the store looks which is weird because you don't ever see it. It's only in the

579
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:21,380
menu like the start menu. But I mean, obviously, he's not gonna fight it. You know, $25 billion.

580
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:27,140
Yeah, I but I think IKEA is doing a pretty shitty thing here. You know, I also, you know,

581
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,900
somebody I already know somebody's type in the comment, they have to chase their trademarks,

582
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:37,060
or they they might. He's not calling it. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm with pod culture. It doesn't just

583
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:42,740
fall under parody. Like, wouldn't you can't you do something that's similar, but it's also

584
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:48,100
distinctly different. And like, he didn't call it IKEA. He called it something else. And he didn't

585
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:52,420
lift the actual brand names. He's calling them something else. And I think it's very obvious

586
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:57,700
when you look at the fact like it's a horror game, that any reasonable person would know that like,

587
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:04,020
when you actually go to IKEA, you're not going to be having a horror experience. Like I in Dark

588
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:11,460
Saga is still in China. It falls under parody. Yeah. And brings up when the in the 90s. And

589
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:17,220
Marvel Comics, McDonald's was called Mac food. Yeah, and pop culture says they should embrace

590
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:23,060
it instead run with it. I mean, they can, but I don't know because you know what they're doing

591
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:27,700
here. I don't know if I would call it Streisand effect. I don't think it's quite that. But I would

592
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,500
say this game now is getting all of this additional media coverage that it would not have gotten if

593
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,820
IKEA didn't send this letter. I'm not sure that's exactly Streisand effect. But it's it's it's in

594
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:42,260
the same family. And it's in the he could probably just change outside of that store to make it look

595
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,580
slightly different. So it doesn't it's not like IKEA. It doesn't really matter. But

596
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:55,220
but I think it's weird Al does an album cover that is really similar to, you know, an established

597
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:59,700
like, you know, what the what was his album that how the Michael Jackson parodies on it that looked

598
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:04,580
just like the bad album? Like, come on. He does this all the time with his album covers. And it's

599
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:10,740
like, you know, people understand. It's, it's a joke. It's a parody. Like a reasonable person

600
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,900
understands the difference. That's true. Dark soccer does say he had a good relationship with

601
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,900
Michael Jackson. That's true. I'd heard that Michael Jackson, like allowed him to use the same

602
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:26,420
set, even. So he did fair, fair, but come on. It's still that even if he didn't, if he,

603
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:31,860
you know, we all know that Coolio had a problem with it. And there was really nothing that could

604
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:37,700
be done. Yes, they made amends and so forth. Yes, that all got, you know, resolved later on,

605
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:43,700
but it was an issue at first, right? So it's just, you know, I just I don't understand why

606
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:50,740
he can't just say suck it like it's parody. This falls and plus, if I isn't this being I believe

607
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:58,340
the lawyer. So the company is in Sweden. The lawyer is in New York, but the game makers in

608
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:07,300
Europe. So how are you gonna how are you gonna fight that? I don't think you do. Yeah. So I just

609
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,740
I think these lawyers did this game maker a favor at the end of the day, to be quite honest.

610
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:18,500
Yeah, we'll see. I mean, it's definitely gotten a lot more publication than it would have. But I

611
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:23,300
hope the creator like I guess if they feel a need to change the color, make it you know what,

612
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,460
honestly, make it a yellow store with blue lettering. And then that's it. Don't change

613
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:33,780
anything else. Don't change anything else. And just say it's very, God, shut up. All right.

614
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:41,140
Let's talk about Digital Eclipse, which is a company that has made a lot of great

615
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:44,180
retro kind of revival sorts of games. You know, they've published a lot of

616
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:50,180
I want to say they did a lot of the Castlevania stuff recently with Konami and so forth. They've

617
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:55,620
been doing, you know, retro packages and stuff like that on modern consoles for a long time.

618
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,300
Most recently, they did the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Cowabunga collection.

619
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:07,460
They put out a new game for Halloween. But it's actually not a classic game. This is a new game

620
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:13,780
that's retro inspired. So it's a game called Candy Creeps. And you can play it with one or two

621
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:20,820
players. And it's a retro arcade like performer, platformer, excuse me, where you take you go out

622
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:27,220
against the pump king who stole candy. Oh, no. And you have to do like Mario Brothers, the original,

623
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:32,420
like jumping on, like, you know, stomping heads and things like that. So apparently this is the

624
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:37,620
first in what Digital Eclipse is going to do as an arcade line. And they're just calling it

625
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:43,860
New Games Inspired by Classic 80s Arcade Vibes. So that's kind of neat. If you want to get it,

626
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:52,260
it will cost you $4.99 US dollars on itch.io. Or if you sign up for the Digital Eclipse

627
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:57,140
mailing list by tomorrow, Halloween, which might actually be today for many of you listening on

628
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:01,620
the podcast, you can get it for free. So you can sign up for the Digital Eclipse mailing

629
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:05,700
list by doing that. The URL, unfortunately, is a little long. So you'll probably have to Google

630
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:10,420
it because I can't read it out here to you. But that is the way you can get it free or just check

631
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:16,020
it out on itch.io if you want as well. So yeah, I think that's, that's, hey, I'm all about a free

632
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:23,780
game. And I like a retro game, right? So it all works. So, well, speaking of retro games,

633
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,460
I think this is a good opportunity to get into our next segment.

634
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:43,700
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

635
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:48,580
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

636
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:05,140
Hello and welcome to the classic game of the week. This game, appropriately, is Halloween

637
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:12,260
for the Atari 2600. It was developed by Micrographic Image, published by Wizard

638
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:21,540
Video, designed by Tim Martin and Robert Barber. It was released on the Atari 2600 in October 1983.

639
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:32,500
And it is based off of the 1978 horror movie of the same name. The interesting thing about this

640
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:38,660
game is that it doesn't have any of the characters named, including the killer. You just sort of have

641
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:45,860
to assume it's Michael Myers, even though the cover art for the box is the movie poster.

642
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:54,500
So the way that you play this game is that you play a babysitter who has to save children

643
01:00:54,500 --> 01:01:02,500
from a knife wielding killer. So what you do is you have to take them to safe rooms located

644
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:09,780
at both ends of each floor of the house and or by stabbing the killer with the knife.

645
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:17,140
If it can be found, you advance by either rescuing five children or stabbing the killer twice.

646
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:22,980
As the levels progress, the killer gets faster and faster and it's game over when all of your

647
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:29,300
three lives are lost. Now, there was some controversy about this game. Number one,

648
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:38,020
this game had gore. Well, Atari 2600 level gore, but gore nonetheless. There were these scenes

649
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:44,180
where after one of the victims is stabbed that blood is showing actually squirting from their

650
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:54,660
body. For Atari 2600, that's gore. And people were really put off by that. They thought it was too

651
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:04,180
violent. Many retailers refused to carry the game. And the other game released by Wizard Video,

652
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:08,740
the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, also after a horror movie around the same time.

653
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:17,140
They actually ran out of money and went bankrupt. So while they were shipping out some of the games,

654
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:21,940
they didn't have labels on them. Instead, they had masking tape that said Halloween

655
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:26,740
handwritten on it. A lot of retailers rejected the game because of this.

656
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:33,460
And while it wasn't a great game, it really isn't. It was still better received than the

657
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:40,660
Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And because the limited numbers of it is now a highly valued item amongst

658
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:47,780
Atari collectors. Trust me, look on eBay and look at what they go for. And if you have one of these,

659
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:51,380
give it to me. I'm kidding. Actually, no, I'm not. Send it to me. I want it,

660
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,580
even though it's not a great game. But that is our classic game of the week,

661
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:01,060
Halloween. And as for all of y'all, Happy Halloween.

662
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:08,580
All right. There it is the classic game of the week, Halloween on the Atari 2600,

663
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:14,580
which I have to admit, I forgot that they did a Halloween on the Atari 2600. I completely forgot.

664
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:21,780
I know some of the classic movie based Atari 2600 games like E.T.

665
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:28,500
But I forgot there was Halloween. So there's that. Dark Soccer is actually in chat saying,

666
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:34,660
I worked really hard on that. They know it was nice, especially for those that were able to

667
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:39,220
see the visuals here live on Twitch. But it still works on the podcast feed as well. But yeah, so

668
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,180
Jamie's actually teased that she might do more of those prerecorded so she can do some more

669
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:48,660
fun stuff with the visuals there. So, you know, if you liked that, tell Jamie you want to see more.

670
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:54,660
Fifth Dream also says pork meat. And also, we could probably put those videos on our

671
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,820
YouTube channel. Hint, hint. So that, you know, a little something extra, you know,

672
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:06,340
on there. So something to think about. Fifth Dream says Porky's. Oh, God. Yeah, that was a

673
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:13,380
terrible movie. And yeah, I forgot there was that game as well. My gosh, my gosh. All right. Anyway,

674
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:17,860
all right. We're going to get right back into it and travel around the industry and check out some

675
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:25,780
other news going on quite rapidly and rapid fire news. So, yes, Loki and rapid Witcher news. We

676
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:31,700
have the news that Henry Cavill is going to be not appearing in the fourth season of The Witcher

677
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:37,140
on Netflix, probably because he's going to be Superman again. And so instead we're getting

678
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:45,140
Liam Hensworth. And nobody's excited about that. But Superman, that's good.

679
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:50,180
Why? Why do we hate him? Besides the fact he's Miley Cyrus's ex? Like,

680
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:55,300
is there celebrity gossip I'm missing? I don't know. Probably it's he's not as cool as Henry

681
01:04:55,300 --> 01:05:01,220
Cavill. But man, I don't care. I didn't watch any of the seasons of The Witcher, so it doesn't

682
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:07,060
matter to me. I know some people very depressed about this news. I get it. Like, it's weird to

683
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:11,700
change the star right in the middle of the show. You don't see that happen a lot. I mean, it's

684
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:18,260
happened before. Well, I think the new Witcher is not supposed to have Gerald either. It's supposed

685
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:25,060
to be a different Witcher. So maybe they do that. And I don't know. And the chat is pointing out

686
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:30,340
this is because Henry Cavill is going to be busy as Superman. Yes. Right. Exactly. I mean,

687
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:35,380
I'm probably not supposed to. I don't know. I don't follow movies enough. But apparently,

688
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:39,220
Superman shows up in one of these recent DC movies. And it's very obvious. Well,

689
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:44,740
we just had the news recently, right? Like, one of those big directors on that had done the Marvel

690
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:49,860
side of the house, right? Is now going to be over like a new DC movie because everybody,

691
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:54,660
everybody knows the DC movies. Not great. But like, they're restructuring that whole thing.

692
01:05:54,740 --> 01:06:00,660
I think I was reading somewhere, right? James Gunn, thank you. And pot culture says he did

693
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:08,260
do some DC as well. Yeah, he did the last Suicide Squad movie. And I liked that. I liked that movie.

694
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:12,900
It was pretty good. What I watched, Wonder Woman, I hear was a big exception to Wonder

695
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:18,660
Woman movies are pretty good. Yeah, the Wonder Woman movies are good. Would I watch more DC

696
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:25,940
because of that? Probably not. I hear that. Shazam is pretty good.

697
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:35,140
Yeah, I don't know about Black Adam. Some people like Black Adam. But once again,

698
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:39,460
this is so funny. sj 100. Matt and Chad says Liam Liam Hensworth

699
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:43,780
is to Chris Hemsworth as Billy Baldwin is to Alec Baldwin ouch.

700
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:47,380
Ouch.

701
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:54,260
Well, we're gonna say are you saying as Eric Roberts is to Julia Roberts? Is that what you're

702
01:06:54,260 --> 01:07:04,660
saying? Anyway, go ahead. We're getting a remake of the very first Witcher game in Unreal five.

703
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:11,300
So that's going to be worked on as well by CG product red. So that sounds cool.

704
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:16,180
Maybe I'll have Liam Hemsworth as a drought. No one.

705
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,860
Maybe not. If you're Liam Hemsworth, though, how excited are you?

706
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:29,220
Like you're, you're having a great week. If you're just give him a chance, I guess. I don't know.

707
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:36,740
But yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's talk about the arcade archives series, which, you know,

708
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:41,540
is on Nintendo Switch, and I believe ps4 and therefore bs5 by association, you know,

709
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:47,620
there are a lot of there's over 100 games in the arcade archive series, and they're still coming.

710
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:51,540
And just recently announced another game that we're going to be seeing in arcade archives is

711
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:59,060
ordain. ordain is a game that was released in Japanese arcades in 1988. It's it's similar in

712
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:05,220
some aspects to Parodius. But in ordain, you are playing a professor that takes to the skies to

713
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:10,500
rescue his kidnapped sweetheart, who's been deducted by his rival. So yeah, get very,

714
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:16,820
very standard 80s storyline there. But yeah, it's very, very colorful little shooter type game. So

715
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:21,620
it's cute. There was a port on the PC engine. But since of course, this is the arcade archives,

716
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:27,620
we are talking about the arcade version. So yeah, this is actually also the first time this game has

717
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:32,180
shown up in the West. It has never been on a Namco collection of any sort or anything like that. So

718
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:37,540
that's kind of interesting, too. So pretty cool. All right, let's travel around the world and check

719
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:42,660
out some games you're going to be able to get this week as well. That one is one I think that's

720
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:46,740
coming out very soon digitally. But what's coming to the more traditional game stores lucky this

721
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:53,140
week. We have lonesome village on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation five and Xbox series.

722
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:58,980
Doraemon story of seasons friends of the great kingdom on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation

723
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:10,260
five. Sumiko, Grashi, Mina de rhythm party on Nintendo Switch. We have the chant on PC,

724
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:20,420
PlayStation five and Xbox series, ghost song on PC, Iron Man VR on PC, harvest Stella on

725
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:28,740
PC and Nintendo Switch. Nikkei goddess of victory on Android and iOS. And that's it.

726
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:36,180
All right. Let's go over to Japan and check out some of the releases that are coming out over

727
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:41,460
there. And then I'll ask Loki to do the UK dates with Dark Soccer out this week. But coming out in

728
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:47,460
Japan, we have on the Nintendo Switch we have Sumiko, Grashi, Mina de rhythm party, which I

729
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:51,700
think I heard Loki mentioned as well. That is a game that's coming out. I wonder what kind of

730
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:58,020
rhythm party it is. It looks like it looks like they're all singing in this game. You press

731
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:02,660
buttons and shake the joy cons to the rhythm of the music. Well, that sounds like samba de amigo

732
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:06,020
or something. That sounds like it could be fun. That's really the only major release on the

733
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:12,260
Nintendo Switch this week. Yeah, it does look a little like bear things. Going over to the

734
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:17,620
PlayStation five this week we have Doraemon story of seasons friends of the great kingdom

735
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:23,140
that is out from Bandai Namco this week on the PS five and that is that's really the only major

736
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:28,420
release in Japan this week. It's kind of a slow week in Japan. I will say though next week. Where's

737
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:32,740
Tiger Claw? Tiger Claw? Where are you? Tiger Claw? Pay attention because next week in Japan,

738
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:38,100
and I think this actually might be the entire world as well. But I noticed that Sonic Frontiers

739
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,620
is November 8. And that's gonna be that's gonna be a big one for some people. So

740
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:48,020
worldwide as a worldwide release. So check that out. November 8. All right. How about the UK

741
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:55,140
Loki and in lieu of Dark Sakura not being here tonight? The UK we've got train sim world three

742
01:10:55,140 --> 01:11:04,180
on PlayStation and Xbox horsetails on PlayStation and the switch. The chance is that never mind.

743
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:09,060
Just go ahead. Keep reading. I don't know. It doesn't say it's Emerald Valley Ranch. So

744
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:16,820
I don't think no, I don't think that that is Sarah Jessica Parker. Okay. Actually,

745
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:26,020
the chant on PlayStation and Xbox we have a tourney am Noctis on PlayStation and the switch

746
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:33,860
humankind heritage edition on PlayStation. We have death's door on PlayStation and switch

747
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:42,580

748
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:50,340
It takes two on the switch Ghostbusters spirits unleashed collector's edition on the PlayStation.

749
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:55,620
And that's it. All right. We have a few more stories for you. And then we're going to be

750
01:11:55,620 --> 01:12:01,940
opening up our discord server to some phone calls. If you want to give us a call over at vog

751
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:05,860
network.com slash discord. And even if you don't want to call us, if you're listening on the

752
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:10,180
podcast feed, for example, you're not here live tonight, you can always leave some messages and

753
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:14,020
some notes in the orange launch radio channel or any of our discussion channels throughout the

754
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:19,300
week. I do read and actively participate in the OLR chat. So and I know Loki has an eye on that

755
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:24,500
too. Dark soccer, dark soccer makes a cameo once in a while the discord server, but she's there too.

756
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,740
And so you know, if you want to chat with us throughout the week, you can do that over the

757
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:34,580
discord server. So I just urge y'all to join, we limit our use of at everyone. In fact,

758
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:39,220
we don't use it. So don't worry about that type of spam, even though it is good,

759
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:42,980
whenever I joined a new discourse or anytime I joined a new discourse or that's the first thing

760
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:47,460
I turn off. And I think anyone out there who's considering setup, setting up a discord server,

761
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:53,060
please realize the app feature has been ruined for everybody. So I would just assume any discord

762
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:56,820
server you set up those features are not going to do any good because everybody's turning them off

763
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:01,780
now. So something to think about anyway. Moving on, we're gonna get back into a few news stories.

764
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:06,020
Unfortunately, these are not the great kind of news stories here. We've had some passings in our

765
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:10,260
industry this week. But let's take a moment to remember and acknowledge those that we've lost

766
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:19,140
this last week, Loki. Yeah, we have Reiko Kodama, who was a developer at Sega. She had worked on

767
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:27,220
quite a few different things, including Phantasy Star, Skies of Acadia, Alex Kidd, Sonic.

768
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:32,260
This is like the golden age of Sega, like all those games, right?

769
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:40,580
Yeah. So she started with the company back in 1984. And pretty much worked on a lot of stuff

770
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:48,660
during like the pixel art days, I guess. So gosh, she was labeled the first lady of RPGs.

771
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:55,300
And award a Pioneer Award at GBC 2018. I heard the way that we kind of found out

772
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:59,780
about this was because they put us very small tribute to her in the Mega Drive 2

773
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:04,740
that came out recently, the mini, the new like Genesis, yeah, to that hold the Sega Mini 2

774
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:10,420
thing that came out recently. And they put a small tribute and somebody had actually tweeted going,

775
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:15,460
you know, usually when you say in memory of so and so that per and they actually confirmed

776
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:22,180
she unfortunately passed away. So that's sad. Yeah, she was 59. That's way too young.

777
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:28,260
That's too bad. And speaking of way too young, someone on the more contemporary side of games,

778
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:34,340
someone you probably heard if you ever played the game Death Stranding also passed away just within

779
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:41,380
the last couple days. The frontman of the band Low Roar, his name was Ryan Karajia. I hope I

780
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:46,740
said that right, passed away at the age of 40. That's Oh my gosh, I mean, that's our age. So

781
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:52,100
that's really depressing. And this was confirmed, unfortunately, via the band social media pages.

782
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:59,300
Hideo Kojima, of course, the mind behind Death Stranding, really pouring out the condolences

783
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:05,460
on Twitter about the vocalist of this game, or excuse me, the vocalist of Low Roar, because of

784
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:13,220
the impact that the music had on Death Stranding. The song All Keep Coming played in the very first

785
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:18,660
trailer for Death Stranding. A song called Don't Be So Serious was one of the first tracks you would

786
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:21,940
hear during the opening scene of the game. I guarantee you, if you've heard the song,

787
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:25,860
you've ever played the game like, Oh, this, I remember this, the first time I heard this song,

788
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:33,300
so it's very, very important in setting the tone for that game. So yeah, on Low Roar social media

789
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:39,940
post, they paid tribute to Kara Zizia, calling him the driving force behind Low Roar, crediting

790
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:45,620
him for music and lyrics and his haunting voice, which again, if you've heard the songs, very,

791
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:50,740
very unfortunate. They did mention that they did record their sixth studio album, and that would

792
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:57,060
be the last project from Ryan and it will be released when it's ready. No date there. So

793
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:02,740
uh, in the statement of tweet, a series of tweets, Hideo Kojima said, you know, expressed his shock

794
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:08,820
over this saying the game would not have been complete Death Stranding without Low Roar's music.

795
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:15,860
So very sad. So kind of a, you have a classic, uh, game maker and a contemporary game contributor

796
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:22,340
really, you know, on both ends there, unfortunately losing both this week. So that stinks. Uh, we have

797
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:27,620
a few more stories in the meantime. Uh, Loki, I'm curious about this next one. This sounds

798
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:34,100
interesting. Yeah. So Sega is looking to do an intend, don't, and that is, they're going to make

799
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:43,460
making a super game. That's going to be coming out by March, 2026. Um, this is a super game project

800
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:48,900
that they don't really, they're not really talking about it, but apparently it's some large scale

801
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:55,540
game that they're working on. Uh, one key to achieving this goal is whether we can, uh, draw

802
01:16:55,540 --> 01:17:00,340
together a large community involving not only players, also streamers who stream the game and

803
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:04,820
viewers who watch their videos, that kind of community expands the further development game

804
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:09,700
content, adding value to the game. It's unimagined by developers sparking broader movement, which

805
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:14,820
they can draw on even more user base, blah, blah, blah. Um, sounds to me something like, uh,

806
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:19,860
you know, very like a sandbox type, you know, like a Minecraft or like a Fortnite or something

807
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:26,900
like that, where there's kind of a growing progression of content for the game driven by

808
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:33,700
fans of it and stuff. So interesting. Don't know what that would be, but it's,

809
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:39,460
it's very ambitious then it's not something we're going to see anytime soon, but neat.

810
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:48,580
I don't know what it's about.

811
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:01,540
Oh, I'm sorry. My mic's been off this whole time. Oh my gosh. Uh, I was, I was, uh,

812
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:06,740
sorry for the awkward silence there, but, um, I was typing. I try to mute myself when I type

813
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:11,220
so that the clicking doesn't come through and I'm not always successful. So I was just joking that,

814
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:15,940
the next step now is to get an announcement of the announcement because that's, that's the first

815
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:21,060
thing we have to do. Right. And I'm very curious about, um, what this game is all about. So yeah,

816
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:26,100
it's, it's hype before that we even know what they're hyping up. Yeah, exactly. Right. All

817
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:33,220
right. Um, last and least, um, tonight, uh, I said I was really done talking about this,

818
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:37,700
but unfortunately the news keeps coming and I have to mention what happened this week in the

819
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:44,500
Bayonetta voice actor saga. Yes, I'm going back to that topic. Here's what happened this week.

820
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,780
So Helena Taylor, of course, you know, she said in some tweets this week,

821
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:52,260
my posts have hit a nerve with people. Low pay resonates, not just in the gaming industry,

822
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:57,940
but in the wider world beyond all over the planet to do it, donate your boycott money.

823
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:03,860
There are many small local charities that can help. And there were some traditional charities

824
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:07,940
that were there, like some food banks and some organizations that helped with the homeless and

825
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:12,180
things like that. Uh, there were some other organizations that were in there as well. She said

826
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:17,860
that these were organizations. She contributed her supplemental income from her convention

827
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:25,540
appearance. I think singular too. Um, but anyway, it was very interesting. Some of the other, uh,

828
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:30,020
charities that were mentioned here, uh, the student pizza fund for the London Academy of Music

829
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:34,580
and Dramatic Arts. That's fine. Pet welfare groups. Sure. But there was another interesting

830
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:42,340
one that stood out. Billboards for life. This is an organization that makes roadside propaganda

831
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:48,020
with, uh, it's basically anti-abortion propaganda. For example, um, fetuses that are showing in the

832
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:54,660
praying position, uh, quotes that say I could dream before I was born and so forth. Um, so

833
01:19:55,460 --> 01:20:02,980
Helena Taylor is using her campaign to, um, urge people to donate to an anti-abortion, uh, charity,

834
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:07,780
which there's not, I mean, some people would agree with that, but, um, there are a lot of other

835
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:14,180
people that would not agree with that stance. Um, so it's, um, you know, again, it's a lot of people

836
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:20,580
are sort of questioning what exactly was her motivation with this whole thing and so forth.

837
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,900
I really have nothing else to say on all of this. I, I'm just going to point to,

838
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:32,900
I done said it already three weeks ago here on this show, and I told you then, um, if this was

839
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:40,180
the tweet that finally woke you up to what's going on, congratulations. Um, I accept apologies in the

840
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:46,660
form of Venmo and cash app payments. I'm just kidding. Tell a friend about the show. That's

841
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:52,020
all we really want to happen here at orange launch radio, but needless to say, when I said

842
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:58,500
she would never work in the game industry again, she's not going to now I do like this and thank

843
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:03,860
you quest buster for pointing this out because this is very, uh, very important to point out

844
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:09,940
the, another voice actress within Bayonetta three, Anna Brisbane, she voices a new character named

845
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:14,260
Viola, and she was able to kind of, you know, unmask this week. Cause the game is now out.

846
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:22,100
She can say, yes, I did this. She did a charity run raising $5,000 for various trans rights groups.

847
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:29,460
And I, I, that is a very well, well, it's a great cause to begin with. And I don't, I don't,

848
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:35,620
you know, I don't want to make, uh, these charity organizations, you know, any sort of like, I don't

849
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:42,980
even want to use the word joke, but my point is this is very much a tongue in cheek kind of,

850
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:47,780
I think, counterpoint to a lot of what we've been talking about these last three weeks.

851
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:53,460
And I think this is Anna Brisbane sort of coming out and saying, don't worry. I'm not like her.

852
01:21:55,380 --> 01:22:00,180
I really think it is, but she's not saying that, but she's saying that.

853
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:06,820
So, uh, but congrats to Anna Brisbane on that role. Uh, and, uh, Bayonetta three's been getting

854
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:10,580
pretty good reviews across the board. I'm not sure it's quite as up there as Bayonetta two,

855
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:14,900
but to still be even in the eighties, high eighties at that and getting some perfect

856
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:19,540
review scores from some websites on your third game is still pretty good. So, um,

857
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:26,100
I, I congratulations to Anna Brisbane, of course, Jennifer Hale, uh, uh, congratulations to platinum

858
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:30,580
on the, you know, games release and all that stuff. Uh, and none for Helena Taylor. Bye.

859
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:36,580
All right. That's it. That's all the news we had for tonight. So now we want to invite

860
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:40,340
one last minute story. If you want. Yes, of course, because I was going to say,

861
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:43,860
we usually would read some emails here to participate at orange,

862
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:49,460
lot of trader.com, but guess what? We still don't have emails. I'm starting to wonder if anyone

863
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:55,060
emails anymore. We get the occasional from Y Y R Ziba or entertainment. I'm not here to name names.

864
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:59,940
I'm just saying. I only noticed there's probably less than five people that have emailed us in the

865
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,780
past like six months. And this is why I always threatened to get rid of the mailbag segment.

866
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:08,340
But at the same time, I don't really have anything where people are engaging to replace it with.

867
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:17,860
So that's why the mailbag still lives on for now, but now seeking engagement platform to get more

868
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:23,300
voices on the show through. So if you have some thoughts, I'm very curious. Uh, Bobby says he

869
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:29,460
has breaking news. I'd be very curious to hear that. Oh, that's great news. Guess what? Bobby

870
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:34,900
just breaking on the show. Do you do if you want to hop in the green room, Bobby,

871
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:42,340
or just barge on in, I don't give a shit and tell us here live on air. You can tell us if you want.

872
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:45,860
I'll read it if you don't want to do it for whatever reason. Uh, Loki though, what's your,

873
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:50,660
what's your last minute topic here? Well, not to be Debbie downer here, but, um,

874
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:57,620
Adriana Chechik has returned back to stream since her accident at TwitchCon where she broke her back

875
01:23:57,620 --> 01:24:03,300
in two places. Right. Um, she talked a little bit about her recovery and also gave the bad news

876
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:09,620
saying that unfortunately at the time she didn't know that she was pregnant at the time of the

877
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:18,260
injury and surgery. She lost Loki. That's horrible. Oh, I wish you'd warned me. That's Oh, that's

878
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:24,660
awful. Oh my God. I think that definitely the people behind TwitchCon have to pay for that

879
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:29,300
for sure. They need to, somebody needs to answer for that.

880
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:36,580
Holy moly. Cause I mean, not only could you have killed like some of the adults there,

881
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:41,460
but you did, you did kill somebody. So it's just, it's horrible.

882
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:47,220
I literally have no words and I'm about to just press the end of the show button. So

883
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:53,140
anyway, um, do you have anything else please to, to palette reset or something that's,

884
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:57,460
that's really, that's, that's, that's hard. I saw a cool picture of, uh, somebody that made us,

885
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,700
uh, one of those century bots from portal out of a pumpkin. That was fun. Okay. Yeah.

886
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:07,460
As soon as Matt says someone throw a pie, uh, Loki, go hit yourself in the face of the pie,

887
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:12,900
please. All right. Actually, here, here's, uh, we're going to welcome Bobby Black Wolf on, um,

888
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:16,100
because I know Bobby had just got some really good news and I definitely want to hear like,

889
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:22,020
what's going on. So hi, Bobby, are you there? Yeah, I am. Hang on. Give me a second here.

890
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:25,940
Cause I haven't done this pie before. I know. No, I don't think you've been on our side of

891
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:29,620
the house in quite a while. So, and I got to make sure you're very loud, but that's okay. It's,

892
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:34,820
it's on my side, not your side. All right. Oh, Bobby's coming through a video. Great.

893
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:40,180
Here we go. Hi, how are you? Yeah. All right. Post-show area. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

894
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:45,540
I'm great. So the chat knows your news, but the podcast listeners don't yet. So tell me,

895
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:49,860
tell me the news. Cause I think this is really exciting. Yeah. So I just got the email

896
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:56,340
literally like, what is Gmail saying here? Uh, three minutes ago, three minutes ago. Uh,

897
01:25:56,340 --> 01:26:01,140
but, uh, I am one of the 22 volunteers selected to be a host for awesome games done quick 2023.

898
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:08,660
Applause. Applause. Congratulations. Cause it's never guaranteed. It is never guaranteed. You,

899
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:14,340
uh, you re audition every time, which is good because, um, then we'd never get any new blood in

900
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:20,420
and there are people that have auditioned, you know, or there are people who've hosted

901
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:26,100
HDQ in the past, maybe done seven or eight events that can't get in anymore. Uh, and it's, but,

902
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:30,180
and it's a good thing that we let new blood come in because some people are like, well, you know,

903
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:35,140
why don't they just have like a set of hosts that they trust that can do, you know, that are there

904
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:40,020
all the time. There are only 22 spots in that list is longer than 22 people. So how do you pick

905
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:49,140
from the 22 trusted veterans on, you know, when you have more than 22. So I am, I am, uh,

906
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:53,780
I am thrilled and excited and I have to probably be posting on social media tonight. So I wanted

907
01:26:53,780 --> 01:27:00,180
to give you the heads up here on board scope. I'm very excited. That's great. And so for,

908
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:04,420
for your audience who probably does, don't know what you actually have to do to audition. Uh,

909
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:08,820
and I can, I can talk a little bit about it, but I don't want to get too much into it, but, uh,

910
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:13,060
we're not even at an hour and a half. So by all means, give us a peek behind the curtain.

911
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:18,900
We got time. Absolutely. Um, so, uh, essentially what they have you do is they give you a video

912
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:26,420
file and you then they say, okay, here's a list. Here's some sponsor blurbs and here's a bunch of

913
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:31,380
donations. They give that to you in, in, in like a Google doc and there's a video and the video

914
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:36,260
has two minutes of just nothing. That's the time between games. And then the first six minutes of

915
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:41,300
a speed run. And during the speed run, the runner will be like, okay, now let's throw, you know,

916
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:44,820
let's have some donations and you're supposed to read some donations. So they're checking

917
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:52,740
how you structure your two minutes of you talking and then how you determine which donations to read

918
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:58,580
and what you say during the speed run. And they'll even say, uh, the runner is looking for us,

919
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:02,260
this specific community member, they're a friend. They want to hear their donation.

920
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:06,340
They'll say things like, you know, we're really trying to push for this or please, you know,

921
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:12,500
promote this part, you know, this prize or this, you know, this upcoming speed run, a bonus game,

922
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:17,380
whatever. Uh, they'll actually, they'll tell you that. And then you put in that thing, uh,

923
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:24,420
your eight minutes you uploaded is an unlisted YouTube video. And then they get, uh, 20 amazing

924
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:30,660
volunteers. I almost said suckers, but 20 amazing volunteers or 25 amazing volunteers or something.

925
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:34,980
They have to listen to everybody's audition and they watch everybody's audition and then they

926
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:40,900
score them on several subjective and objective things. So there's scores about, you know,

927
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:44,820
you get an extra point. If you read this donation, you lose a point. If you read this donation,

928
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:49,380
then it all averages together. But they also have some subjective things. Were they energetic? What's

929
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:57,220
their tonal voice like stuff like that? 112 auditions. Each audition is about eight minutes

930
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:03,940
long. Oh my gosh. And they selected 22. Congratulations. There were 17. There were

931
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:10,500
17 judge volunteers. I'm getting to this part of the email. They send stats. Um, and, uh, yeah.

932
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:16,980
And it's basically, it's a score out of 50. Uh, the 22 people had to score 42 out of 50. What'd

933
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:21,940
you get? What'd you get? I don't know. They don't tell me what I get yet. Okay. Um, I have to

934
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:25,780
actually ask, I can get feedback and then I get like the judge's comments and so I can figure out

935
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:32,580
what I'm going to work on. Uh, but, uh, the high score was 45.8. Oh, so nobody, nobody gets a

936
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:36,580
perfect score. No, no, nobody's ever gotten a perfect score. I think like one time somebody

937
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:42,340
got like over a 46, but usually like in the 45 is your high score. So there is, there's only like

938
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:49,380
three points separating first and number one and number 22. And then there are six backups

939
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:55,220
who scored more than 41 points, but less than 42. And that was six. So there were six people

940
01:29:55,220 --> 01:30:01,380
that placed in the 41. And the first time I did this SGDQ 2020, I was in that backup group. Yeah.

941
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:07,460
I had just missed the cutoff line, but still that's great because you've done every single

942
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:12,740
one since. So, but I know, I know you work on your craft and you listen to the feedback and you've,

943
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:16,820
um, you know, kind of talked to others within the community and I'm sure you all kind of, you know,

944
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:20,340
talk about what works and what doesn't work. And that just helps I'm sure at the end of the day.

945
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:27,060
So, yeah. Yeah. And the downside of, of, of the hosting audition process and, you know, I'm not,

946
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:33,540
I don't mind talking about this is that it really helps that I've done it, done the actual event

947
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:37,220
because there's lots of things the judges look for that they don't tell you. And you'd only know if

948
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:43,300
you ever did an event. And so that's why you do see a lot of the same people hosting in every each

949
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:47,540
event. It's because once you've done one, you know what the judges are looking for and you know,

950
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:52,740
the little two things to put in that they don't tell you necessarily in the audition documents.

951
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:56,980
Yeah. And I don't, I didn't, you know, people should not listen to that comment and read into

952
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:01,700
it. Like, Oh, it's, it's rigged. That's not it. It's just that, you know, as again, you talked

953
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:05,860
about that there was a subjectiveness to the energy. How do you know the appropriate level

954
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:11,140
of energy? Well, either you've listened to a lot of the, you know, in, in the past, because

955
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:16,180
certainly if somebody was over energetic, you know, you know, if you're talking about,

956
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:20,660
let's talk about the prevent cancer foundation, you know, it's like, maybe that's a little too

957
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:26,340
much energy. Yeah. Yeah. But how do you know that? Unless you like, listen, you get that feedback

958
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:30,340
and that sort of thing. So I, you know, again, cause, cause when you say it that way, there's,

959
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:35,220
there's going to be people that will read into that, that, Oh, it's rigged. Cause you know,

960
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:38,660
you know how the internet works with the conspiracies. Yes. But it's not rigged.

961
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:45,620
It's just, it's on the job experience helps. Yes. Yeah. And yeah. And so a lot of people

962
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:49,460
will sit there and they'll like redo theirs and stuff. And I will say mine wasn't the first take.

963
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:54,260
They don't ask for your first take. They let you watch the video. You can see what the timing is

964
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:58,340
supposed to be. You can read through the donations because they don't want you reading every donation

965
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:02,100
because they throw in things that you shouldn't read on the air. And they're like, can you,

966
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:08,100
what's your judgment? And me doing this, my show and working with you and working with VOG,

967
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:12,820
doing this for 17 years, having to read chat comments in real time and react on the air

968
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:20,500
has helped a lot for sure with that. For sure. So, so I'm, I'm thrilled that I got in. I don't

969
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:25,380
know, like now I've got to tell them what I'm interested in hosting because the game list is

970
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:32,100
out 14. I know I, well, so that's, that's probably going to be an in-demand one though. It's going

971
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:39,060
to be very in demand. So there's like Froude who I've hosted many things before. He didn't get in

972
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:44,740
and I don't think there's any Yakuza runs in anyway. I'll have to check. Well, I mean,

973
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:49,140
I also understand they got to, they got to mix it up. They can't have the same thing every year.

974
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:54,500
And also this is the, this is the one that is going to be virtual because it's virtual again.

975
01:32:54,500 --> 01:33:00,740
Yeah. We talked about, you know, a few weeks ago that they had to kind of not be in Florida

976
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:05,860
anymore for a variety of reasons. And that is a risk that they're taking with that. So,

977
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:09,780
and that's why there were over a hundred auditions. The, for SGDQ, I think there were

978
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:16,020
only like 90 something auditions. So because anybody around the world can, can be in your,

979
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:21,140
you're now, you know, I was competing against people in Australia that wouldn't have been able

980
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:25,540
to make it to, to America. Couldn't afford to make it to America, you know, cause that's a lot of

981
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:31,060
money. They were able, they were in the mix and other people who probably still aren't comfortable

982
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:35,780
with large gatherings, they were in the mix. So, you know, it was, it was a lot, it was probably

983
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:40,980
a tougher competition this time around. So I'm just very thankful that I, that I get to work

984
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:45,700
with them again. Very curious to see what summer looks like too, you know, with, you know, I know

985
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:50,180
it's a ways out, but just, just very curious to see how that shapes up in light of what happened

986
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:54,340
with this one. But I know it's still going to be great. It's still the virtual ones have been

987
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:59,300
awesome. A lot of people kind of think they should keep mixing the virtual with the in-person ones,

988
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:03,540
or at least, you know, have some out. So it's, it's cool that we are getting that. And yeah,

989
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:07,460
I'm, I'm thrilled you get to be involved with that again. And very curious to see what you end

990
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:11,380
up posting, especially since there is no Yakuza one that would certainly have you with it.

991
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:15,780
Right. Yeah. There, there are some games in there and I've also gotten to meet people that I think

992
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:20,420
that are running and stuff. So I may be able to, you know, now that I've actually been a part of

993
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:24,740
the community for, you know, a couple of times now, and I've gotten to meet some of the runners,

994
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:28,100
either working with them in the past or meeting them in Minneapolis when I was there.

995
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:35,140
You know, I, I may, you know, have some people that want me there. So that's, that's some runners

996
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:39,540
that would, cause runners can ask for a specific host as well. It's not just one way. That's great.

997
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:44,580
So, so we'll see. The summer one will most likely be at that same hotel in Minneapolis. They're

998
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:50,580
pretty happy with that arrangement. So it's, it's just, where is Awesome Games Done Quick 2024 going

999
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:55,860
to be? Because I think some of the stuff, the reason they moved it from Virginia to Florida was

1000
01:34:55,860 --> 01:35:00,900
a, they wanted to be near a major airport and also they wanted it less likely that winter

1001
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:06,340
weather was going to affect it because it was happening in mid January. So it would be snowing

1002
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:11,460
in Virginia and it's hard for people to get around if they're not from the area. Like I didn't want

1003
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:17,060
to drive up there, you know, that's why I loved magfest in March that one time. Cause it was after

1004
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:23,060
all the winter weather stuff. I'm so now, as she says, move it to Atlanta. Wink, wink. I have a

1005
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:29,620
better idea. I'm just going to say it doesn't rain anymore here in, uh, you know, lovely Los Angeles

1006
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:36,580
or San Diego or Las Vegas would all be excellent choices that are all near major airports. I'm just

1007
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:43,300
saying yes, but also what they're looking at is the cost. Well, but I, I would still argue Vegas

1008
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:48,020
is always cheap, cheap hub, but yeah, I get it. I get it. They got to find the right match.

1009
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:52,500
And I, and I know people are saying move it to Atlanta and I'd love that too. Um,

1010
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:57,220
because obviously we can handle it here. It's just the thing I worry about and I don't want

1011
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:02,820
to get into details or go on, go on about this, but, uh, Georgia has its own political problems.

1012
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:09,700
And so I'm not sure if the games done quick organization, which I have said is progressive

1013
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:14,980
to a fault sometimes. Uh, I don't know if they would be comfortable being in Georgia. They

1014
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:19,380
wouldn't be comfortable being in Texas. So if this is the line that they're going to take,

1015
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:24,500
I can't see them coming to Georgia right now. And that's again, why Vegas jumps out at me

1016
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:29,060
as Vegas is more purple or Nevada is more of a purple state, right? So it's, it's, it's a

1017
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:34,100
very well-known swing state. So I, I, I kind of feel like, I don't know, Vegas, Vegas just

1018
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:38,900
is the solution to everything. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah. How about Georgia's purple too,

1019
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:45,060
but it's just true, but the rules, we have the laws that are on the books can, can fair,

1020
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:51,140
have some people take second, you know, not want to come here. Yeah, I get it. So we're,

1021
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:55,780
we're working on it. I live here. We're working on it. Early voting is open right now in many

1022
01:36:55,780 --> 01:37:03,620
States. It is here too. So I reminds I got to fill out my ballot. So yeah, I already did mine.

1023
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:07,940
All right. Well, Bobby, I appreciate you coming back. I come in over on our show and giving us

1024
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:13,060
that breaking news. And again, congratulations. They're lucky to have you, um, really look forward

1025
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:17,140
to seeing what your trajectory and your path through that look, looks like and what games

1026
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:21,300
you're going to be involved with. So I'm looking forward to it. All right, Bobby, you take care.

1027
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:26,900
Thanks for joining us tonight. Thank you. All right. Bye. All right. Always good to hear from

1028
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:31,220
Mr. Black Wolf here on OLR. He's good enough to have me on a show every week to promote what

1029
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:35,780
we're doing here. So I have no problem having him here. Uh, if you want to be on orange on radio,

1030
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:39,460
you can hop in our green room, but you better do it real quick. Cause, uh, I'm about to think

1031
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:44,660
there's no calls that want to come, uh, in, uh, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash

1032
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:49,940
vog network. A lot of, uh, echoing of the go vote, uh, statements, Jaskren saying, go vote.

1033
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:54,580
Dark to see us saying indeed already sent ours out with voting. Good, good. Okay. S Jonah Matt has a

1034
01:37:54,580 --> 01:38:02,100
good question for us. What are your favorite TV Halloween specials on the Paul and Halloween

1035
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:09,940
special? Uh, my favorite specials on TV for Halloween are always the Simpsons Halloween

1036
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:14,420
episodes. The tree house, the new one that they have coming out now with the anime Simpsons,

1037
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:19,460
the death note. Yeah. I mean, I need to watch that tonight. Isn't it? Or is it next week? Yeah.

1038
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:23,780
It's tonight. So, um, that looks awesome. But yeah, the Simpsons Halloween specials

1039
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:29,540
are always great. That's a really good answer. Um, that's good. Um, I don't know. I get more,

1040
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:35,300
I don't really get into a lot of the Halloween ones. I mean, I always love a good Elvira

1041
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:38,820
appearance on television, but you know, she, Cassandra Peterson, isn't really performing

1042
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:43,860
that part. Like it's a very special occasion. She does, um, Elvira at this point. Um, I was

1043
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:48,900
going to say one other one. It's not TV, but since we live in the age of YouTube, uh, red

1044
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:55,860
letter media's Halloween specials, their, um, best of the worst, all these, um, stuff is always good.

1045
01:38:56,820 --> 01:39:00,500
Um, I'm looking in chat at some of the comments here as the show and Hunter Matt says they

1046
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:04,740
brought back David S. Pumpkins last night. I forgot about that. That's good. Zen monkey

1047
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:10,340
11 says the worst, which that's a good pick is too. We love Tim Curry in that one. Uh,

1048
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:13,780
dark soccer is saying I'm going to be the Halloween special by playing Cenobite.

1049
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:23,940
You open the box. I came, so, uh, where will play night was good. It's short. It's only like 50

1050
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:30,180
minutes. Nice. All right. Uh, Dr. Sia says the great pumpkin Charlie Brown picked it up on DVD

1051
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:37,940
because I noticed it stopped airing on TV. Nice. All right. All right. Well, nobody else is in the

1052
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:41,780
green room, so guess what? We're going to wrap it up. We're done. We're out of here. We're gonna say

1053
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:46,180
good night. Good night. Let's get people's final thoughts and get on out of here for the night.

1054
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:51,540
Um, Loki, what's your final thought? Oh, actually, wait, before I, before I get that, let me of

1055
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:55,540
course say as always, thank you so much for listening to orange launch radio. Thank you

1056
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:58,980
for being here tonight. Even though it was a little bit of a shorter show, we were down to

1057
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:04,500
host. It happens kind of a slower news week, but thank you for being here and being a part of the

1058
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:08,660
community, whether you're here with us live or you are on our podcast feed throughout the week.

1059
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:12,740
We appreciate it. We'd love to hear from more podcast people, be it on our Twitter at OLR or

1060
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:16,340
our mailbag. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend or

1061
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:19,780
two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has

1062
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:24,660
a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air, uh, in order to, uh, have them. So, uh,

1063
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:29,700
yeah, uh, a nice five star review wherever you found this show that goes an awful long way. So,

1064
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:36,020
uh, we really appreciate those. And, um, yeah, I, uh, I don't know what else to say. Uh, we won't

1065
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:39,700
be here in two weeks, but we definitely will be here next week. So we will see you all again next

1066
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:45,620
week, uh, with another episode of the show. Now I'll go over to Loki and get your final thought

1067
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:54,500
tonight. Um, go subscribe to my channel, I guess, low gal are at, um, YouTube. Great. They're going

1068
01:40:54,500 --> 01:41:00,100
to be getting those. Uh, was it the, I don't know that they call on them now, but it's basically like

1069
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:06,900
a, a new URL thing that they're doing. Not nicknames, but it's like something I don't

1070
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:16,260
know what they call it. Uh, aliases or something, right? Yes. Um, let's see. Um, oh dark soccer

1071
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:22,820
wants to remind people about the marathon that she's doing, uh, and I, I, I I'm okay. It was,

1072
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:27,060
I was about to say, is that still happening in light, but, uh, dark soccer does want to point

1073
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:33,140
out it's moved to February 15th in light of her own, uh, voice issues. It was going to be Tuesday,

1074
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:37,700
but she's just knocking it back two weeks. So, um, heads up on that. Uh, that is going to be

1075
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:44,020
on February 15th from noon to midnight, 12 to 12. So, uh, check that out. A dark soccer. Again,

1076
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:47,540
she talked more about that on last week's show, but that is for, uh, to support some of the

1077
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:51,460
medical issues. Her mother's been going through, uh, recently. So if you want more on that list

1078
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:58,340
last week, but the date has changed to February 15th, uh, doctor's orders on that. Um, my final

1079
01:41:58,340 --> 01:42:02,820
thought tonight. Um, I don't, I mean, I could plug my stuff, but I do that all the time. I

1080
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:08,420
would just say I'm, I'm feeling really good about the show last night. I did live Rocky horror. The

1081
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:13,220
crowd was fantastic. I have been loving hosting and I've been getting to do a lot more of it

1082
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:18,420
this year because the last two years have been asked with COVID for live events. So I'm just

1083
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:22,820
really happy to be in the swing of that again. Oh, I'll tell you, I have not even said this on

1084
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:27,220
Twitter or anywhere. Cause I just found about it. I found out about it last night. I am hosting

1085
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:32,980
another non horror event here locally. This is going to be a fun one. Loki, you could bring the

1086
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:39,140
kids to this one. It's this kind of event. So I'm not saying you have to go, but, uh, December 10th

1087
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:44,740
here, I am going to be hosting a life or not life screening, but a screening of the movie home

1088
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:51,220
alone from the nineties. So, and we actually, yeah, we actually have one of the stars of the

1089
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:54,580
movie, not Macaulay Coke. And I'm sorry to say, it's not gonna be there, but, uh, one of the other

1090
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:59,300
kids, Angela Goethals, I think is the celebrity's name. She is going to be in attendance. So, and

1091
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:03,780
it's a, they're calling it a non horror screening, uh, from love horror events. So it's going to be

1092
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:08,260
a holiday thing. Um, so I'm really, really, really excited to do that. That's going to be December

1093
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:13,780
10th. So I guess that's my plug here locally for those of you in SAC love horror events.com. If

1094
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:18,740
you want to see, um, all, I mean, it could be a horror screen if you, if you believe in the whole,

1095
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:24,900
um, home alone in the saw universe thing. Well, and then if you look at a lot of like,

1096
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:29,940
what was, you know, like the, the, the, yeah, the traps that, you know, he was setting up for those

1097
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:34,100
burglars, it is kind of messed up. If you think about it, it could be a little bit scary. Um,

1098
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:39,620
I will also say they are doing a screening of sleepaway camp, the camp, uh, 1980s, uh,

1099
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:45,060
movie classic and the Angela or Felicia Rose will be in attendance for that one. Um, I am not

1100
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:48,500
hosting it. Unfortunately it is the same weekend. I'm out of town. It's the same weekend. We don't

1101
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:52,740
have a show, but I just, I think it's really cool. They're doing that. So yeah, lots of fun

1102
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:57,780
shows there. So anyway, um, that's it. We're out of here for tonight. Thank you again for, uh,

1103
01:43:57,780 --> 01:44:01,460
staying up late with us and, uh, we'll see you in seven days. We'll do this all again. Hopefully

1104
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:05,220
dark soccer is clear to come back with us next week and we can all be together again to talk

1105
