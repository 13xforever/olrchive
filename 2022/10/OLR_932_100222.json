{"text": " Flashback, November 2019. The world hasn't yet had its great withdrawal, and yours truly produced a segment for Episode 799 of this show, expressing concern about the long-term viability of Google Stadia. Flash forward to today, and Stadia is headed towards the Google graveyard, announced just hair under its third anniversary. I hate to say I told you so, but I said twelve and a half minutes of things. This is the apparently important story, now it's time for your hostess. Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and not Google Stadia news. Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice. Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with Episode number 932 of our show for tonight, October the 2nd of 2022. I cannot believe it is already October, but here we are. It is officially Halloween season and pumpkin season. Nobody can stop us. From a pumpkin spice latte now, except maybe, except maybe the one and only dark soccer or Jamie Summers. Hi, Jamie. Hi. Can you believe it? Next week, we are going to be at TwitchCon. How are you feeling about that? I am feeling stressed. Why stressed? Cosplay. She's literally threading needles as we are live on the air. No, I'm not threading a needle. Sorry, it looks like it from the tiny camera shot. I am. Well, these are crochet hooks, but they're going to be my pig weapon. Oh, okay. Knitting needles. So, I am trying to get this super glue tape, and I got, I cut the wrong length off. So, I have to cut another one. All right. Well, I have a lot I want to talk to you about here this week, but first I want to make sure I introduce the one and only tech master, Loki. Hello. And you might not find Loki at TwitchCon this weekend, unfortunately, but you might not find Loki at TwitchCon this weekend. Unfortunately, but you will find him lost in Minecraft, making big build videos, which by the way, I do want to say hello to the chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network. That's VOG network, because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the voice of geeks network. That's again twitch.tv slash vog network, and you can chat along with the show to where pixel pockets are. in chat saying, Hey, Loki, your 300,000 blocks build video was awesome. I just watched it this morning. And it looks like that's what's playing behind you now as we are live on Twitch. But for those that can't see on the podcast feed, why don't you tell us a little bit about this video that you made? Yeah, so I, I've been doing like, for those who may not have heard, like, I've been doing a Minecraft season with channel 64 SMP, and I've been building in like a Mega Man theme type thing. So because Mega Man is not really something that people have done as far as the theme goes, and you have lots of steampunk casts and stuff like that, but it's not really something that people have done. Cyberpunk that type of stuff. So I thought this would be kind of unique. So some of the things I've been doing have been covering different redstone farms or mob farms with giant builds. So I did like a few weeks ago. Anko, which is the giant angler fish from Mega Man 2. Well, this one was the giant robotic octopus from Mega Man 5 from Wave Man stage. So this is Octoper. And because as you can see, well, if you're watching the video, you can see that the farm is very tall, it required everything to be, you know, scale it up to fit. everything inside. And so it ended up being 300,000 blocks. This is incredible. How do you do the timelapse? Like, again, I'm sorry to the podcast, but we're watching a video of him building it where it's on a timelapse, and it looks really cool. And this time, how do you do this, Megan? Oh, it's a fun mod. So there's a mod called replay mod, which allows you to basically record your gameplay in Minecraft, and then you can set up virtual cameras and all that stuff to spin it around and everything. So this timelapse, I had 18 different clips over the course of like, I think only timelapse about 18 hours of it, it did take about 80 hours to do it. But some of it like was, you know, before I even started doing timelapse, like draining out the ocean to do the parts that were under the water, because I had to sink the whole build down, like 30 blocks into the ocean just to be able to fit it all in there. But yeah, it was a lot of fun. It took a long time, like a month worth of time to do it. resource gathering ended up being 185 shulker boxes worth of materials, which is insane. My last big project was a mountain and that was 200,000 blocks and a lot of that was just grass because you know, it's a mountain. But yeah, I don't know if I'll do anything as big this season. I mean, this is probably gonna be the biggest build in there, but I'm definitely worth it. working on more builds that will eventually culminate into like a giant, a big build altogether. So hopefully, you'll be able to do that very soon. Well, again, for those on the podcast feed, I really have to stress to because you know, we were taping live on Twitch, we can show the video and it's like, wow, this is really impressive, like the amount of work that goes into this. So I really urge those of you on the podcast feed who can't see this right now. Check out Loki's video over on YouTube at Loki o lr. That's just l o k i o l r. So check that out. Alright, it came out really well. It's also been hard to like do some of these creatures or different like robots because really like in the game and it outside of the game, like because this is based off the manual art. But there's like really only like three pictures of this. There's a picture from a comic book. There's the manual and then there's the sprite. And so it's just trying to figure out how to translate that the 3d was incredibly difficult. I think the design process was incredibly difficult. Oh my god. I mean, the way okay, that even makes it more impressive the way you kind of had to incorporate your own 3d artistry into that because there's so little reference material. That's incredible. Loki. Good for you. Yeah, it's a lot of fun, though. tweeted at Capcom or so I mean, I doubt the you know, because Minecraft is not their game. I've been pimping the hell out of this. Oh, good. Mega Man subreddits, all the different Minecraft stuff. Good. It doesn't really it doesn't help too much in the views. But like, yeah, it's cool. I think, you know, people enjoy it. I'll find it eventually. Oh, well, army do your thing. Help Loki's video I get get seen by the folks that need to see it because it's it's damn impressive. And that's right. Make that monster grow. All right. Um, so we're gonna get into tonight's kickoff topic. And so I'm I'm well aware many of you out there that listen to the show already follow gaming news. See, you probably know exactly what we're going to talk about here because here on orange launch radio, dark Sakura has been quite the advocate and user and proponent and in honest to God in many ways, poster girl for Google Stadia. I would argue on Twitch, you have carved a niche of yourself on being a Stadia streamer. And if you haven't heard the news, because I know there we do have some some more casual folks that listen to the show that do get some gaming updates from the show. The the short line of this is Google Stadia shutting down. They're going to be pulling the plug on Google Stadia. And so I'm sure many of you are wondering, how's dark Sakura doing? So dark Sakura, how are you doing? And tell us more. I'm obviously giving the quick story. But tell us a little more. What's happening? How are you doing? I am going to start with the what's happening part of it. Okay. So I'm at work in the office my first day back completely at work. I'm laughing because what's happening isn't what's happening with Google Stadia. It's what's happening with me. No, I'm reading the backstory on how I found out. Picture it, Sicily. Now keep in mind, I work with our intern-ish Drew. And we sit on the same row. We're in office the same day. So I went over and was chatting with Drew and talking about Dead by Daylight. And I'm like, yeah, you should play with me. I'll act as your meat shield, you know, blah, blah, blah. And then behind me, our coworker, Bonnie, he turns around and says, oh, yeah, they just posted that they're, they're canceling Stadia. I'm like, no, they're not. They just did all this stuff for it. They have all this support. They just did other language patches, you know, then opening new servers and blah, blah, blah. He's like, I'm like, where did you see this from? It's like, oh, it was on Twitter. I was like, oh, I don't believe it. Which is good. That's good. That's how you should react to things you see on Twitter. Well, and then he's like, oh no, there's a link going right to Google's press release. I'm like, oh the fuck. And I'm like, no, no. And I went over and looked it up and fuck, it's on the New York Times. So I, I was sitting there and a little bit going, how am I going to rebuild my computer? Is my computer worth rebuilding? Should I just buy anyone? Oh shit. That's $3,000 I don't have. And I basically spent like the entire rest of the game, the day thinking, how the fuck am I going to keep playing Dead by Daylight? Cause I can play a bunch of other stuff. And then I was thinking about the Nvidia service and the game looks like shit on Nvidia. If you want to do the free service, it's a, you get an hour to play. If you do the middle of the road, you get six hours and very little in the way of upscaling. And then if you do the premium, yeah, you get the 4k and, and this, but it's still eight hours of gaming. So it is timed and it's 20 bucks. And I'm like, no. And so I was basically like, what do I do? What do I do? What do I do? And I was going on and checking my prospect, my prosper Pro cross Pro get, Oh, you know, the word I'm talking about. Um, yes. So, um, and right now they have account merging disabled due to a bug, but I'll get to that in a minute. Um, and then I remembered this like service that was only in the UK for a while and I went to check it out and it, it actually is good. Um, it's called boosteroid. So I made sure boost droid would work. I can actually play other games than what's on destroy because it will link my, uh, my whole steam account. So I'm going to try VHS on it, but I have an alternative not to fear. I've got something that will, will tie me over. So, um, at any rate, what is going on? Is it Google has stated that they will shutter the game service? Um, in January, it will shut down on January 18th, as stated by Phil Harrison, their vice president general manager. Um, he actually did the whole blog post about it. Um, and he said it hasn't gained the traction with users that we expected. So we've made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service bitch. That is all your fault. It could have. Anyway, now this is the statement that, that actually really has me thinking that they are well and truly star sorry about it, because not many companies do this when they end any of their online services. They will, and this is, I'm, I'm reading this actually directly from the New York times reputable, you know, Google will refund all game hardware purchases made through the Google store, as well as game purchases made in the Stadia store. Now, when I went further to look at that, they have also stated that they are refunding all add-ons purchased. Do you know how much I've spent on dead by daylight? I was about to say, am I understanding correctly? Like, and this, this is not a call out post, but if you've watched dark soccer streams, it is quite obvious. You have spent hundreds of dollars on dead by daylight. And if I'm understanding, there's a little bit more, I actually watched a stream that said how much each the whole game would have cost with all the DLC and the cosmetics that went with them. It was something like 300 bucks. If I'm understanding correct, because Google Stadia is refunding all that money. And because you get to process progression, this all over to steam, essentially Google paid for you to have a dead by daylight deluxe account at this point. Pretty much. So let me actually find it. Cause I've got their FAQ up directly from Google. Okay. So can I just say for anyone that ever gave dark soccer shit for being the Stadia streamer on Twitch, guess what? Google just fucking comped it. Google just Google, Google bought it with what money? I don't know. Cause this is, you know, Stadia has now literally made Google no money. And I do agree. It's, it's a nice thing they're doing. They didn't have to do it. It's probably best they are doing it, or there would have been a lot, a lot of fun, potentially a big, big negative. I think this could quite easily go the other way, but it is, it is wild. And our, our chat is lighting up. Loco Poco is like jackpot. DJ Rob S is like Jamie came out the winner, Bobby Blackwolf talking about people, you know, teasing you for being a Stadia streamer going the last laugh all the way to the bank. Hell yeah. Well on top of that too. All right. I'm going to read the part of the FAQ. Will I get a refund? What is available for a refund? We will be offering refunds for all Stadia hardware purchases, Stadia controller, founder's edition, premier edition, and play and watch with Google TV packages made through the Google store and software transactions, games, and add on purchases through the Stadia store. Stadia pro subscriptions are not eligible for a refund. However, you will be able to continue playing your games in pro without further charges until the final wind down date. Next part. Do I have to return my hardware to get a refund? Most hardware purchases, as said above, made directly from Google will not need to be returned. More details on how to obtain a refund for your Stadia hardware purchases will be posted here in the coming weeks. And their goal is to have the majority of those refunds back by January 18th. I'm trying to just, we, all right. I just got billed for my subscription because Bobby was mentioning, he got billed and I just got billed today. If you see, you may still see a bill on your regular billing cycle, um, um, that all pro subscription charges anytime or after September 29th, 2022, will be refunded as our refund process continues. So what this means for me is that all, and this is how I'm translating this. I'm willing to be wrong. Every piece of DLC that I have bought for Dead by Daylight, the game, all the other games that I bought, including Cyberpunk and a good number of other games that I, I paid a decent amount for to play. I'll be getting the money back for that. All of the RX cells that I have bought. And I ha I admit I have a problem with RX cells. I probably spent a good 400 total in the last year and a half on RX cells because my survivors must be pretty. Um, that's coming back. I'm expecting to get anywhere between 600 to a grand back. I really don't know how much I spent. I'm like, I could honestly see Google sending you a check for a thousand dollars. I can honestly see that, which is, which is wild to me in a good way. And I don't know if they're doing the refund by check or if they're returning it back to your, your normal billing. So I don't actually, I think mine bills out of my Apple card. So maybe that will all go into my Apple cash. Who knows? But at any rate, I, I am completely, look up Poco. Um, they said that it is for anything bought through the Google store. Uh, so if you bought a stadia thing at target, they can't, they can't do anything with that. Basically. Uh, I am linking the FAQ for those in chat. Um, but I think if you go to support.google.com slash stadia, you'll be able to get directly to the FAQ. Um, so, um, so, oh, and as for anyone who's pre-ordered anything, all future pre-orders will be canceled and you will not be charged. If we're already charged, you will be refunded your payment. Um, I have, I paid with a gift card and I've thrown it away. How do I get my refund? They'll send out an email that says, choose a new form of payment. So yeah, there, I think that they're letting you choose how you want your refund to come. If you want it to just be credited to a bank account or, or something like that. So, so at least Google's doing quote unquote, the right thing, which, you know, again, many companies would have not done. So, you know, as much as, you know, I think there's a lot of things to tear into about Google about this whole thing. And we'll get to that. At least there's this nicety here that, you know, I could see most companies probably wouldn't have done at least to this extent. I mean, the fact that you're getting the refunds on, you know, the, the cosmetics and add-ons and stuff. But I mean, this also was a big fear for people going to Google in the first or Stadia, excuse me, in the first place was you watch Netflix, pull movies from the service. You watch Amazon, pull stuff from the cloud, and you can no longer watch it on your account. And there was a lot of people that were nervous about Stadia because what happens if Stadia closes? Am I just up shit Creek? And I think the nice thing here is, well, Google has answered. No, we're going to make good. But, but that means this entire three years of Stadia, if I'm understanding this correctly, this entire three years of Stadia, Google has only made money now off those $10 a month pro subscriptions. That's the only thing they're keeping. Otherwise they, they, they, they have lost a significant amount of money on this. So wondering if they are, if they've done the math and plan to break relatively even, but I don't think that they are. Cause the majority of the extra money coming in was from those add-ons and bonuses. Wow. Now here, here is actually just going back to where this works out for me, is that because I have my steam account and I've already, I've owned dead by daylight on steam for a while, my steam account and my Stadia account. And if I had an Epic account, it would be there too. I'll link to behavior. I have them linked. And when they get this bug fixed, I'll be able to have my, uh, my progression sink again, the quote merge function. This means that while I will be refunded for all of this stuff, I'm keeping it on steam. I tested things, all my stuff was there, like pretty much item for item, except for the RX cells, which I had 20, so no big. And, um, my achievements, the only achievements that it gave me were the ones that it could read off of my account, meaning my prestige levels, my character levels and the new prestige system. So, um, I, I don't know. Um, we'll see how, how that works out. Um, but thankfully I can, I can keep playing until I can afford a new computer or have it rebuild or some kind soul wants to give me a computer. I'm not, I'm not too proud to say. I offered up the old machine I had and you can salvage whatever you want to get out of that. Probably. I streamed dead by daylight off of it. It just wasn't the greatest, but you could probably Frankenstein a better machine from some other kind people as well. Get this. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to eat. Um, I can play an ultra through, um, boost droid. Oh, that's awesome. But that's, that's the, that's the cool stuff that cloud gaming is supposed to do. Right? So I want to, I want to shift here a little bit from the conversation about, you know, so it's, it sounds like if you're worried for dark Sakura, don't worry, she's laughing all the way to the bank, but I've got to imagine there's a part of you that's still frustrated on how much positive promo you've kind of tried to put out there for Stadia. I mean, hell didn't just last week, two weeks ago on the show, you were on a Stadia focused podcast. And I imagine that individual who I know listens to OLR. Hello. And I, I'm thinking of you during this difficult time and all of you that have evangelized Stadia and tried to tell people who have been saying since the beginning, Google sucks and is not going to give this platform what it needs. And many of you, you know, you tried your damnedest to go against that headwind and say, but there's something here. There's something here. And sure enough, at the end of the day, Google says, here it is. Here it is. Google delivers the punchline that all of the skeptics were worried about from day one. They weren't going to take the amount of time it needed to invest into it. So I'm curious how you're feeling on that front. Business. I don't really, once I found my alternative, I was actually okay with it. Um, and I mean, and while it was active, it did everything I said it was doing. Right. Right. And if some decision came from the powers that be that they, uh, wanted to end it, that's not on me. I, I advocated for what it was at the time. Mm hmm. And once it was over, it was over. And I'm sure I can't be mad about something that it's not just affecting me, something that's, I mean, I, I, I really, and it could just be that I was a little bit overwhelmed by it, you know, and, and, you know, it's easier sometimes to just shut down the emotional centers than to focus energy on it. Um, but I'm not, I'm not mad. I'm not mad. It is what it is. What's the point of being mad about it. I can't do anything about that. Yeah. Um, by the way, for those who are, um, uh, in the chat room, I am posting a link from my Twitter of comparing what stadia looked like versus boost droid. And I think it's interesting. You bring up the boost droid thing because I think there were probably, honestly, a lot of people that have listened to this show over the years and heard the positive things that you had to say about stadia, who I think realized, and I think this is important to say too. I think all of us, whether we were skeptical and, and, and for me personally, I was always skeptical of Google's business end of it, but the technical end of it, you didn't have to sell me on the technical end of it. Like when I played destiny two and stadia and stuff, I was like, dang, this looks really good. Like for, for a clap, like for considering it's streaming, it's like, it's like an interactive YouTube that looks really good. Like the technical end of stadia never bothered me. My only reservation about stadia was exactly the whole, I do not want to give them money only to have them pull the service in three years. Now I knew what I was doing though. And I, I, I could have never foreseen that Google would give all the money back. I don't think anybody could have called that. So, I mean, again, kudos to Google on that ad, but there's still a part of me that says, how the fuck does Phil Harrison have a job right now? How did he, how did he have the office to write that memo? How does he have a job? I don't think it was his decision. Oh, it probably, no, you're right. It probably wasn't, but I think his decisions have not always been good and have ultimately led to this. His lack of making it a profitable service is also what, you know, it impacted the fact that, yes. And we, we, and now we've heard about decisions that Phil Harrison himself made that probably weren't wise. And one of them was the fact that Hideo Kojima apparently offered a sequel to Death Stranding to Google that they turned down. What? Because Google did not believe that single-player games were worth the investment. That, that is a huge bonehead move that Phil Harrison is absolutely responsible for. And there's other game companies out there that have already learned this lesson that, yes, people do want single-player content and are actually kind of turned off by multiplayer content that gets segmented into games and so forth. So I absolutely, there are things that Phil Harrison did that shot this company in the foot or this, this branch of this company in the foot. Absolutely. Thankfully, whoever decided to pull the plug at Google, whether that was at the very top, the CEO himself, or, you know, whatever, had the good sense to refund the money so that there isn't, you know, an angry mob. You know, we, we can be kind of cool and collected because, all right, well, at least those investments I'm getting back, it didn't work out. But like Google, Google lost a lot of money on this. And how Phil Harrison stays employed in this industry at all after, after constant missteps, let's not forget Phil Harrison was at Atari during their years. He was at PlayStation during the launch of the PlayStation three. He was at Microsoft during the launch of the Xbox one. Both of those were disasters. Phil Harrison has, this was the greatest quote I saw in an article, and I'm sorry, I don't have the article in front of me. So I can't remember who wrote it. Phil Harrison has been failing upwards for years in this industry and how the fuck does he keep getting away with it? Anyway, I had to say that piece because, and that's, that's the important thing. And that's where my brain is with Google Stadia. The tech was always great. The management was always a disaster. And how apropro, how apropro that we're digging out all of those launch photos from GDC of the Dreamcast, the Power Glove and ET on the Atari 2600, where people are like, what the fuck do all those things have to do with each other? Oh, well, the Dreamcast and the Power Glove, maybe they were ahead of their time a little bit, but it was, and I would, I would, here's my argument. I would actually say all of those three things ended up being very prophetic towards Google Stadia, all three of them. Here's how Sega Dreamcast technology that was just too ahead of its time. If the, if the Dreamcast had just landed a little later, it probably would have taken off even larger and been bigger. Power Glove again, ahead of its time. And I know what you might be thinking. The Power Glove was kind of a joke. It was a peripheral. You know what? Well, what is the PlayStation move? Isn't the PlayStation move essentially what the Power Glove thought it was on the NES? I would say yes, the Power Glove, or at least the concept of the Power Glove was ahead of its time. Now what does ET on the Atari 2600 have to do at Google Stadia? Gross incompetent management flopping hard because that's what ET on the Atari 2600 was, was yeah, sure. HSW can turn around ET on the Atari 2600 in six weeks, just give him an extra bag of cocaine and he'll be just fine and make it happen. And boy, oh boy, allegedly, boy, oh boy, he made it happen, but at what risk? Because that get management had to have that game out for the holiday season on a certain day, which in fact, we've learned years later, if a video game is good, you can launch a video game outside of the holiday season and it will still make a ton of money. So all three of those things, in my opinion, ended up being very prophetic about Google Stadia. Anyway, sorry, I had to get my feelings out about this because I'm just blown away at what an absolute disaster this didn't have to be for Google. And going back to Dark Sakura, because you are our Stadia girl, is that I think there's probably a lot of people out there that were going, well, what's next for Dark Sakura? So what cloud does Dark Sakura go to? Does she go to xCloud? Does she go to Luna? And you've kind of answered it. You're going to do this boosteroid thing, which I had never actually heard of it until you said it. I have a Luna account, but I don't think Dead by Daylight is on it. And if they brought it out and then let me link it to my behavior account, I might actually go that route. Streaming it would certainly be a fuck of a lot easier. Quickly, Amazon or Twitch has a very large convention coming up in the very immediate future. And they will be tapped into a very large audience of gamers. And if perhaps they wanted to make a big move with a service that they have that caters to gamers, especially in light of something Google just fucking handed them on a silver platter this week. This would be the time to do it. So yeah, but but but Rob, haven't you heard cloud services are very expensive at you know, it's not like we have a cloud service company we could just go to and get those services for cheaper. We're Twitch. We can't do that. It's just too expensive. You're right. I'm an idiot. Anyway, back to our soccer. You know what? I don't I don't have to play anything else either. Or pay for anything more if Luna had all of these things because it's free with my my prime account. And I'm shocked that Luna doesn't have dead by daylight considering Amazon Prime has a thing with dead by day. I'm telling you, I'm telling you, if Amazon doesn't make a big fucking move next weekend with Luna, they are fools. And that that can absolutely be true. Well, they have like the SNK games that I love. They have the Mega Man collection, the Jackbox collection, the Yakuza game, Star Wars Pinball, Tetris Effect, Sonic Mania. I'm looking through this. They have grid. They have potion permit. Just a bunch of stuff on here and Okami. I'm actually going to. Yeah, I'm just saying isn't it fascinating that we're sitting here going and what are we doing? We're talking about the future of cloud gaming that Google just decided this week. You know what? Even though there is a future of cloud gaming ahead, we're going to throw in the towel with Stadia. And I again, I am still I am still convinced despite whatever criticisms I've had of Stadia in the past because of its business model, not its tech, I still believe cloud gaming is absolutely, absolutely where this industry is headed. And once 5G becomes much more prevalent, you're going to see it a lot, lot more. And it's just it's what a disaster that Google can't see that. So I did check and it's not on there, but Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes are on there. Luna and on Luna. Yeah. And medium. Blair Witch game, a few other things on there, like one of the games that I was super happy about control is on there are type dimensions. Yeah. You know, if you want to watch me cry, Killer Queen Black. I mean, there's there's some really good stuff. Luna's a decent setup. It's a decent start. If Amazon would just put some promotional oomph behind it, because I feel like nobody includes Luna in the conversation at all. Personally, I personally think the people that are leveraging cloud gaming the smartest way right now is Microsoft and that maybe I have a Microsoft bias. I don't know. And the reason why I say that is because I think they are leveraging cloud gaming very, very well into their model. They game pass. And that's what Microsoft, Microsoft believes game passes the future of gaming, because by including cloud gaming with game pass, I think that is a very smart thing for them to do. That's why I think Microsoft is but but Microsoft doesn't have everything either. You know, there's there's certainly places you can be critical of them. I just think the way they've been inching into cloud gaming is the way to do it. And now Microsoft has a Hideo Kojima project coming that apparently has to be cloud powered somehow. You can now now some dots come together and there's an aha moment that Kojima took his pitch to Google Stadia and took it to Microsoft who saw the value in it instead. And this is why Phil Harrison can go kick rocks, because he's going to miss out on something big that Microsoft's going to get now because there's no room in gaming for single player gaming anymore. What a what a fool. What an absolute fool. There are so many single player games on here, by the way. Like, I'm actually looking through the retro channel, too. And oh, my God, there's so many good things on here. Anyway, I don't want to ignore chat either. I'm curious, chat about your thoughts with Google Stadia. And, you know, where your head is out with all this. As you know, Matt in chat says, Google only measures success in billions. Stadia was successful, but in the millions that doesn't work for Google. They only want to bet small for high return. And we were all saying this from day one that Google was just doing this too soon. I think Google Google misstep this from the beginning because I think that they had been a little smarter about instead of trying to sell a store, trying to sell a subscription. And I do know they did go there. They did talk about Stadia Pro. They did talk about the the ten dollars a month and the games that were included with it. That should have been the lead when they launched Stadia. And it wasn't. And they let that lead get out from under them. And that was a critical error from the beginning, in my humble opinion. Questbuster in chat says, from one perspective, Stadia is the 3DO of cloud gaming. Great technology ahead of its time, left to win a war all by itself. Marketing, what's that? Mike Deff says, Google Stadia was planned to launch in Mexico and other Latin American countries this year. That's not happening now. LOL. What a hugely missed opportunity to open up these games to other countries where the games aren't always readily available. Now, I understand the internet infrastructure also may not always be readily available, but there are plenty of places where it is. And so it's interesting that Google, again, didn't even give that a chance. And now another thing they're going to lose to Microsoft and whoever else decides to stay in Nvidia and whoever else decides to stay in this race. Because I think if I'm understanding correctly, a key element of this Boostroid thing that you're going to is that Boostroid isn't really a store or a service. All it's doing, it's kind of more like Nvidia. It's like Nvidia, but you are playing through their servers. So that's the service that you're taking right there. The thing is that unlike Nvidia, when I closed my game, like when I was done testing Dead by Daylight on it, I had full access to the other stuff on my Steam account and immediately launched Hooked On You, which wasn't among their list. Although it only gave me something like 20 gigs, I guess, allotment for the game. So I couldn't go and install Mass Effect. But I could do Mass Effect separately and load that up. But I don't want to do that because I'm relying on my save files. Yeah, understandable. Shehulk10 in chat says, Stadia should have sold to PlayStation or Xbox. Well, my understanding is Google's still kind of keeping that technology in their back pocket. And we have to remember, one of the places they do make money and still run is YouTube. So Google's probably going to hang on to that technology for themselves. Although, a fanboy dream would be, oh, well, Sony has their cloud service now for PlayStation. Xbox has their cloud service now for Microsoft. Google should go sell their cloud to Nintendo. But they're so- You wouldn't know what to do with that. Exactly. Nintendo wouldn't know what to do with it. Nintendo would not know what to do with it, even though honestly, they have a brilliant use case with the Switch and the fact that they are selling cloud service gaming on the Switch with games like Control and the Resident Evil remakes and all this stuff. Nintendo could absolutely leverage the Stadia technology, but they wouldn't know what to do with it. Yeah, Bobby says Nintendo already has cloud gaming though. But it's a footnote in Nintendo's book, at least in this country. It's not technically Nintendo that's using its third parties that are using different cloud technology for each of their games. So it's not like some central thing. And honestly, cloud gaming for Nintendo would be fine because especially when you're talking about like the Nintendo online stuff where we're talking NES ROMs, like I could I could cough more data over the air than one of those ROM files would take. It's just like you could literally anything could stream that stuff when it comes to the Nintendo online stuff. But yeah, they wouldn't use it in a meaningful way for sure. Questbuster and chats as I mentioned this on Bobby stream, but when Ubisoft dropped the immortal Phoenix demo on the service, I tried it and it worked great. Really wish they could have provided more demos like that one felt like they missed out on the opportunities those could have opened up. There are there actually were a lot of demos on Google Stadia, but they did a terrible job marketing them only the only the hardcore fans knew about that stuff because I see our soccer nodding like yeah, there's a lot of demos on that service. And even the game I talked about last week that yards revenge, all of those all of those like Atari reimagined games had demos on Google Stadia. But how many of us really knew about that outside the stadia bubble? A lot of those Yeah, we're just they would send out the marketing announcements to people who are already on stadia. Say hey, you're on stadia play this demo like no, I don't want to play that demo when in fact Google knew and had easy access to gaming influencers on YouTube that could have carried the message a lot better. But alas, I'm I'm not the one running Google Stadia Phil Harrison is. So the other thing is that I still think the majority of the content creators were going to be on Twitch anyway. YouTube has YouTube certainly has enough to make it to do things with for sure. So the other thing I wanted to say with the comment that quest buster talked about with the demos is that I think you know, it's it's also like the times I have personally really benefited from cloud gaming was that because when I did have a bandwidth cap, see, I'm fucking spoiled. Now I'm a spoiled bitch now. That's why cloud gaming doesn't fit in for me. Because I have a new computer. I have gigabit internet that has no cap. I'm a spoiled bitch now technologically. But when I didn't have that just a year ago when I was at the old place that had metered connection and a computer that wasn't cutting edge, like cloud gaming was actually really great to trial games without having to download a 70 gigabyte game to actually see do I like this game before I commit to all of that bandwidth to download it, I think was great. I would imagine you'd be using more bandwidth by streaming. But not 30 minutes to test it, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I was, you know, the, the, when I would play for 30 minutes to test something, it was a negligible impact on my cap. Certainly much more than the gigabytes it took to download the game otherwise. But now I don't care, you know, but, um, I'd still be curious what cloud gaming can do because my technology isn't gonna last forever. So I would be very curious in five years when my machine is not cutting edge anymore. I'd be very curious how cloud gaming can fill in those gaps technologically, but you know, we'll see in a few years, I guess. So, all right. Um, we're almost an hour into the show. I want to make sure we move on with other topics, but Dark Soccer, I want to let you have any final words or last words on this Google Stadia topic, because you have been the voice of Stadia on this show for as long as, you know, you first played Dead by Daylight on the service. Meh. Fair enough. All right. Let's move on then to how is your gaming week? And let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week. By the way, just on a quick aside, my Elgato stream deck works again because they put out the magic, yes, I know I could have patched it myself like three weeks ago. I'm kind of lazy though, outside of Sunday nights, but they put out the, everything is magically patched with the new OBS and the steam stream deck though. Just, just if you've been holding off and lazy as well, everything works again with OBS and the stream deck. So the patch went out, just so you know. All right. Anyway, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week. Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? Um, I played Dead by Daylight. I signed up for the Meet Your Maker demo, um, which is the new behavior game in the works. Trying to figure out how to take this thing apart to make my knife eject. Um, I've been working on a lot of cosplay, speaking of video game stuff, just a lot of cosplay. And I did a, I did, hold on. I did this for our friend Losing Color. Oh, that's really, that's, uh, if for those in the podcast feed, it's a drawing that I'm assuming Dark Soccer did herself of, uh, the nurse from Dead by Daylight, you know, one of the Matsuri collection, one of her particular cosmetics. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so I've had a bit more of a creative week in regards to, I need some pliers, uh, to playing games. Um, just doing other things related to them. Um, I beat Final Fantasy four last night. Um, and so I'm going to be moving on to Final Fantasy five after TwitchCon. Oh, cool. Um, and really it's, uh, oh, and Cult of the Lamb, of course, which I'm finally ready to, to fight, uh, the one who waits. So we'll see how that goes. All right. Um, but yeah, that's, that's pretty much it. Okay. Loki, I have a feeling we got a lot of your gaming week at the top of the show, but I'll ask anyway, how was your gaming week? Uh, it's been mostly just Minecraft stuff. It's actually, I mean, it's been Minecraft, but I haven't working on a ton of things because I put out the video at the beginning of the week. So most of it's the, uh, what we call the, uh, the post upload blues. It's where you kind of wander around aimlessly doing like just nothing because you don't know what to work on next. Um, so I'm working on a storage system is what I'm doing now. So I've got, I'm digging out under the mountain that I'm going to be building my mega basin to put a storage system because, um, I felt that that helped me a lot when it came to playing on nerd craft, where I built basically the same storage system, um, and keeping organized. Cause before that on collision MC, uh, I did not build the source system and I regretted it because it took like five times as long to gather materials. It's just, okay, where did I leave it? Which chest was it in? You know, that type of thing. And on the note of collusion MC, unfortunately they had to shut down their server for their second season. Um, the end of this month or last month, I guess at this point. Uh, so that was unfortunate, but at least we've got a world download and everything and not, you know, I wish them the best of luck. It was fun playing on there. They were my first, my first SMP. So it was great, but you know, the same thing happened with the first season. There was Pete, the player base kind of dropped off sharply in the beginning and then never came back in the second season. The same thing happened, but there's a few cool bases out of there. Someone built like a, it was a K2 mountain built a giant ice castle in a mountain. It kind of looked like a from frozen or something super awesome. So I got to take screenshots of that and share those with some people and stuff, but yep. It was fun. It was fun checking that out. All right. Uh, my gaming week, I've played some of the stuff I usually play like Diablo three. I got past Paragon 800, which is kind of a landmark because that's when you have all of the points and all of the Paragon categories, and you just keep gaining one of your main stats over and over again. So it's a kind of interesting landmark there. Uh, so there's that. And then, I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14, of course. I did some streaming of that the other night, just, uh, you know, getting the latest, getting the latest and greatest gear for my character and all that good stuff. I've also been playing Dead by Daylight. Um, I actually, that for the first time, you may find this hard to believe, but for the first time I finished a Tome. Not that I got all the way to level 75. I didn't put in enough hours to do that, but I got to the end of the fourth page of the challenges. And I've actually never done that before in the year. Plus I've been playing Dead by Daylight. So that was kind of neat. Um, that, that was a miracle. And it was actually on stream. That was one of the challenges I had to do was escape through the hatch intentionally. And for those that play Dead by Daylight, I put together a build specifically to do this. And I use the new Ada Wong perk that, um, when you're the last one, yeah, no, not a wiretap, a low profile, the one with the high heels on it. When you are the last one standing in the match, you would lose your scratch marks and blood pools for 90 seconds. The only thing I didn't realize about that perk is that if the next to last survivor gets hooked and you're still alive, your perk activates, but the hatch isn't open yet. I had to wait for that person to pass away before I could actually start hunting for the hatch, which I found, and it was right by the door. Spirit closed the hatch, ran back to the door. I ran to the hatch cause I brought my whole idea. I didn't want to bring in a key cause I knew the killer would target me because they saw that I had a key. I brought Plunderer's Instinct and dug up a key in the basement cause like nine times out of 10, you get a purple or pink key in the basement. So I dug up a key and then Spirit came back to the hatch. As I'm opening it, I get through the hatch with a half second to spare. And you see me on stream going, whoa, like that was colos, colos. That would have earned a get shitted on. Yeah, yeah, for sure. For sure. So I did it and I got through the whole thing. So the whole thing was on my Twitch feed. That was pretty fun that I was able to stream that. Other games that I've been playing this week, I played a little bit of Splatoon 3, just a little bit, not enough to really talk about because I was at a work thing this week that actually took a lot of my attention on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and I brought Splatoon as something to play in the hotel. I played for maybe 20 minutes tops. So I have much more to come with Splatoon 3. I don't have a lot to talk about right now. I'm going to try to play some more of that this week before TwitchCon. Here's a game I randomly got into. Here's why I didn't play Splatoon 3, because Rob did that whole thing where it's like, ooh, shiny, here's something else I'm going to play and get sucked into for the entire weekend. So this is random. It's a game I've played before, but it's now on Xbox Game Pass, and it's one of those games where I'm like, ooh, I wonder how that would look on my new computer with the 4K setup and all of that. So I played Death Stranding, which is now on Xbox or PC Game Pass on my computer. It looks so fucking good. Walking has never looked better. It is so good looking. And I don't know if that's just because when you play something on your computer, it's right on that monitor in front of you. You see the textures in a way that I don't always see it on my TV, but it is gorgeous, gorgeous. And I didn't realize it's a good spooky October game to play. There was a really good jump scare in a scene I was doing with the whole, the BTs or whatever they're called. But anyway, yeah, I've been so- I thought the scene with Conan O'Brien was pretty scary. I played quite a bit of that game when it first came out, and I remembered very little of it, like as far as the plot goes. And because, you know, a Hideo Kojima game, it has like a four hour introduction and the whole thing is like, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, there was that, oh yeah, I remember this part. It was a lot of like rediscovery. But again, just playing and walking through those landscapes and the beautiful HDR 4K with the hipster music soundtrack playing behind you. I was like, this is nice. This is a nice thing. This is, this is, this is what chill vibes mean, except for the spooky scary parts. When you're in the chill vibes part, it's great. So yeah, Death Stranding is, it's really, if you have Xbox Game Pass, go visit it. And it is very weird, by the way, to fire up Xbox Game Pass, launch the game and then see the splash screen Sony Interactive Entertainment presents, even though it has the 505 games logo too, it still says so it's like Sony in my Xbox. Yeah. It's more likely than you think. So you got Sony in my Xbox. I know it's just, it's wild. D'Artestia says, I wanted to get into it. Just frustrated me every time I played. Don't forget, there is a Bobby Black Wolf mode that helps. You can set the game in very, very easy, which helps a lot. It doesn't make it perfect, but you, you also never die in that game. Don't forget not to spoil the plot too much, but there's something about the plot where you actually, you can't, you can't be killed. You can get frustratingly reset, but you can't be killed. So there is that for what it is. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, MLB The Show players are used to it, has the whole Marvel-esque logo too. Yeah. Yeah. The, the, I know with MLB The Show on Xbox, it's always a wild thing to see, but that's, that's the agreement, right? So anyway, that's been my gaming week. So, uh, with that, uh, just, I would say here, and usually at this point, we talk about any, um, show, uh, updates and changes you need to know about. And that is, we will not be here next week. Dark Soccer and I both are going to TwitchCon in San Diego. Um, and so we'll not be here on Sunday cause the convention is actually through Sunday. And, um, I don't come home till Monday and Dark Soccer, I think is still at Disney on Monday. So, um, we won't be here on Sunday. Loki might do a stream. I don't know, but Bobby Black, Bobby Black Wolf will be here at VOG Network over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, still doing his show. And we certainly encourage all of you. Um, uh, I want to say locals. That's not what I'm thinking of all of you, uh, regulars to check out Bobby's show on Sunday night. Um, even though we won't be here with anything new, but we'll be back in two weeks to talk all about TwitchCon. If I can't talk Dark Soccer into maybe doing a special VOG stream earlier in the week where we just talk about TwitchCon, we'll have to maybe see. We can do that. See, I've, I mean, maybe we could even like, do like a little audio thing while we're there. We've got an Airbnb and I'm sure you would be more than welcome to drop by for whatever we do. Yeah. I don't see why not. We can figure something out. We're going to that and we're going to, to the brunch on a Saturday, right? Maybe. I think so. Oh, through. Yes. Yes. That one. Yes. Yeah. So we'll, we'll have opportunities to do stuff while we're there. Oh, for sure. All right. Um, so there we go. We probably should try to get a bunch of streamers to make little, even though we don't use bumpers, that's usually a Bobby Black Wolf thing. Um, we should get streamers to make bumpers for our show. You can always put one in. We can always put them in the beginning before the, um, when we're live, we have that little, um, you can't do that on television inspired, uh, parody intro. We can always do something before that, that introduces the show. I don't know. We'll, we'll talk about it. If it is still Cult of Lambchop. Cult of Lambchop was your favorite? You didn't like tonight's? I didn't see it. Oh, well, okay. I don't always get to see them. I don't usually play these on the show, but just for Dark Sakura. Death Stadia will not be seen tonight so that we can bring you this special presentation. You see, because Death Stranding was on my brain. It's actually, it's actually gotten layers because then you, then you get to the layer of, Oh, and Stadia was actually pitched a Death Stranding project that they passed on and so on and so on. All right. That's that strong leadership from that Phil Harrison. Death Stranding? Nah. Nah. Don't need that. I can't believe they never even tried putting the original game on the service to see like, like a smarter executive would have said, well, why don't we put Death Stranding on the service? And if it meets these benchmarks, then we move forward with a sequel, but they didn't even, was Death Stranding ever on Stadia? I don't think it was. I'm pretty sure what, yeah. See? Hmm. Hmm. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. We have some more gaming news to get into. Loki, why don't you kick us off with some gaming news tonight? All right. So it is the year 2022 and we are going into the fourth quarter and well, it's not surprising to see games be put out at $70. We're now seeing them being put out at $70 more frequently to which I say, why? Well, I know why agreed. Um, but they, why should we expect, pay for this for $70? For example, uh, Bethesda just recently put out Skyrim, uh, the anniversary edition on to the Nintendo switch for $70. Um, so the anniversary edition though, I'm pretty sure, um, it wasn't $70. I mean, they originally had, okay, so there's a digital anniversary edition that had some additional perks with it. I guess it's $70, but I mean, the game's been out for so long. It's Skyrim already came out on the switch as it is. And obviously they didn't give it the special edition treatment because, well, I don't think the switch could run the special edition anyways with the HD or graphics and that type of stuff, but it's only 10 AP. Okay. Um, so I'm not sure where they think they can command that kind of money on this game, especially how old it is, dude. But it's on a Nintendo plot. This literally feels like Bethesda saying you got to pay the troll toll because this is now coming out on the Nintendo. Well, it's been out on Nintendo, but it's like, Oh, now this is a all in one edition and you got to pay the troll toll because it's it's on Nintendo. Here's the best part about it though. You're going to love this. So to buy the anniversary edition on the PlayStation five or Xbox series X or S where, you know, these games probably look the best. It's only $50. And the next gen upgrades for those platforms were free as well. So if you bought it like on, you know, a PlayStation four or something like that, you get it for free on PlayStation five. Um, I don't understand. It's not like that they have to pay money to publish this physically. Cause it's a digital version of the game. So why I'm guessing it's because the, the regular version of Skyrim, for whatever reason on Nintendo, like this is Skyrim on the switch is still $60. Why, why is it still $60? Like that game is like 20 bucks at most on most platforms. There's no reason it should be $60. A Nintendo game. I understand them not dropping the price. I still have problems with it, but at least that's understandable. Like super Mario Odyssey Skyrim is been out since 2011 re-released so many times. There is no reason that that should still be the same price. It was when it came out. So I want to just don't buy it. I want to address. Yeah. I want to address a comment and chat because fifth dream in chat says funny. I don't remember when they told me it was mandated. I buy it. Oh no. I mean, it's, it's absolutely not mandated that you buy it. Here's the problem. And so if we're making it sound like it is mandated, you buy it. Here's the problem. This won't sell because everybody's laughing at the $70. I'm sure there are some very loyal Nintendo Skyrim people that will buy it. It's going to have a very niche audience. Otherwise this is not going to sell and we all know it's not going to sell by the way, pay attention to what the kickoff topic was tonight. We're all looking at the business model going. This is ridiculous. And they're not going to sell any and what's going to happen as a result. Bethesda is then going to go and look at this and say, Oh, our games don't sell on the Nintendo switch. Well, we shouldn't really continue to develop for Nintendo. Our games are selling over here, but we don't want to put the resources into Nintendo switch because our games don't sell on Nintendo switch. So there's that, but then, okay, so that's yourself. You play and it's so many times, you know, this you're, you're making fun of me and rolling your eyes at me, all of you at home, because you absolutely know, I am right time and time again, executives play themselves. It's like they get no feedback. They have nobody in their ear that actually consumes this stuff. It should like, let's put it this way. If let's say, for example, if Skyrim is still $60 on the switch, my first question would be, why haven't we dropped the price of that game yet? Because that came out years ago. It can't be a top selling game on the switch right now. That deserves a discount. Then you put out the game, you know, say you put out the game of the year edition anniversary edition or wherever like that, then you could maybe charge I'd say 50 bucks for that. I don't even think it's worth full price for Skyrim at this point, because it's been out for so long. Like maybe then you can put it out with all the bells and whistles for $60. $70 is pushing it a lot, especially for a switch game. And I would understand if like Skyrim had never been on the switch. And we're putting out Skyrim, the regular edition for 60 bucks, and then we're going to have this anniversary edition for 70 launching beside it, that would make a little bit more sense. I would still say it's too damn expensive for Skyrim to be on switch. But like, that would make more sense. This doesn't make any sense. Now, moving away from Skyrim, wait, can I get some comments in chat? Zen monkey 11 says, Believe it or not, there are some gamers that only have a switch and they don't PC game either. Completely valid. However, if I was one of those people, I those people are literally being taken advantage of. Like, no wonder there's piracy. Not that I would ever advocate for that. But no wonder there's piracy. Tigerclaw in chat says I can see why because of the convenience of being able to take it anywhere. Yeah. And at the end of the day, if you want to spend $70 on that, go off. I'm not telling you not to do it. I'm just saying the amount of people that are willing to do it is not going to be enough to move the needle in a way that's going to impress Bethesda. And, you know, Tigerclaws poking fun at take it from Rob, who is known for rebuying the Mass Effect games every time they release a new edition. You know what console didn't get the Mass Effect trilogy though, but, you know, drag me, expose me. That's fine. But even if it was a Mass Effect game that I bought again on the switch, which by the way, I wouldn't at $70 for the trilogy on switch, I wouldn't. It's not worth it to me to do it again because the trilogy is lacking multiplayer. Why did I buy Mass Effect three as many times as I did so I could play multiplayer with people on that platform because Mass Effect was never cross platform. And I usually got it on sales or discounts where I was like 20 bucks so I can play with my friends on PlayStation three. Sure, I'll do it. So there are some key differences here. But even putting that aside, and let's just say I'm ridiculous, and I'm going to buy Mass Effect trilogy again on switch, I am not enough to move the needle. And so that like, you know, I would argue that, you know, you're saying seven, someone's saying $70 is fine because, you know, it's the price of being able to play a portable Bethesda didn't design this portable system, they're just publishing on it. All the other third party publishers out there aren't charging $70 for their games, or their game of the year edition of these games that come out later on. So it's ridiculous to think that they should be able to charge that. And that's fine. You go, you know what, you can make an experiment. And maybe that's what they're doing. Hey, let's experiment with Skyrim. Let's see if we charge $70 for it if we sell it. And then if it doesn't sell, then they can mark it down later on and make it look like it's an even bigger discount. But they're really charging the same price they would have charged for it anyways, whatever. I'm gonna make a quote, there's a sucker born every second. And those suckers are buying next gen games in the fourth quarter, because we're going to have even more companies. And it's your usual bad sub or bad offenders when it comes to $70 games, putting these out. So for example, we have Gotham Knights coming out October 25, charging $70. No, thank you don't want that game. It looks like garbage. Call of Duty Modern Warfare Two. Well, Activision has been charging $70 for their games. I'm telling you right now those 10 extra dollars aren't going to investigating all the corrupt behavior that's in their company or any of the sexual harassment charges or anything like that. So that's money wasted right there. God of War Ragnarok Sony's just sniffing their own asshole with that. I don't know why they think that they deserve an extra $10 for that. Whatever. Fine. The crystal protocol. No, no, I don't think so. And then we have four spoken Dead Island to Hogwarts legacy, Wild Hearts, and Skull and Bones. I'm gonna tell you right now, like if we're charging an extra $10 because you're saying that development on these games is going to cost even more. I better expect a fucking perfect game from you guys. I'm not expecting this buggy shit and this roadmap to putting out a semi complete game from all you stupid fucking companies. And that goes for Activision doubly. Sony, I don't have a problem with them. I know I'm sure their games will be fine. But they're in their own ballpark with charging $70 for their own games. That doesn't make any sense. Gotham Knights Warner Brothers, I don't trust them. I just these games better be damn perfect is all I'm saying for $70 that you're upping the expectation because you're putting a premium on there. So I expect premium QA, I expect premium coding, I expect premium everything on this. If you're going to charge a premium, I expect the premium product. I don't expect a roadmap. I don't want a premium roadmap telling me how you're gonna fix your game that you're rushed out because you just wanted some money before the holiday. Because this is what I'm saying. This ties perfectly into a comment in chat, which is a fair read. fifth dream in chat says and then we complain about worker wages and crunch. Hmm. Okay, then if that is going to change, and like Loki said, if we're going to get the value for all of that, then fine. You know that then all right, things are slowly increasing across the board anyway, inflation is a thing. But that's $70 better. Like if I spend $70 and I get cyberpunk 2077 on the PlayStation four. That wasn't quality chair. Well, I'm going to choose my words carefully. Don't reorder any quality check was ignored. I'm going to be pissed. So if the thing is between like and I totally agree with that perspective, but my concern is this extra $10 probably isn't actually going to fix that. If it does, then you know what, I'm a lot less hot. But I feel like with all the stories we're still hearing from what's going on in the industry. This isn't going to change. And not to mention, it's not just $10 premium. That's just the starting cost. They still are going to be pushing all their DLC, all their season passes, all of that nonsense that they normally plagued with these games. And they're always complaining. Oh, well, we don't have enough money from these. Yet they're like making billions and billions of dollars off of this. I don't believe you. It goes back to a running theme for tonight is that some of those games have a lot riding on it, things like, you know, for spoken and so those other games you mentioned there, that like this higher price point may be the thing that pushes people to say, you know what, no, I'm not going to pre order. I'm not going to do that. And then squares going to go back and say, oh, and we all know, we all fucking know, the company that said Tomb Raider was not a success is going to come back and say for spoken didn't sell enough copies. I wonder why that happened. Well, I mean, they won't take the blame themselves. It'll probably be something themselves. It'll be something stupid. Like they'll be like, oh, it's because it was a female protagonist. And there's so many chauvinist pigs out there. It must be that reason. Not because we charge $70 for our game or anything like that. I mean, I don't know. But all I'm saying though, is in a world where we have these companies, and it's it's time after time after time where they release buggy products, I just can't pre order anymore. And honestly, if it's digitally, you shouldn't be pre ordering it. Like you can order that right up to when it comes out. There's no need to buy it early. Because it's not a guarantee. It's absolutely not a guarantee that you're going to get a working product, let alone a product that is good. And I just, I don't know, you want to know the funny thing about gamers. All of this is true. Everything that we have been saying, at least for us, you know, our perspectives are the is is is the truth is the gospel. All this is is it but at the same time, when Final Fantasy 16 comes out, oh, bitch, I'll plunk down $500 for the edition that comes with a PlayStation five that's branded the ultra ultra digital edition was dumb at dumb ass costumes that are involved so I can dress like snow from Final Fantasy 13 or whatever ridiculous things they put in there like the cup cup noodle extra edition that just just it give us all of your money and give it to us now edition but absolutely 100% will be true I will be there paying for it because I am a consumer whore but also but also but also creative creative unit three has a proven track record for me and the the staff and the talent that's behind that game I'm trusting to make a good game as they already have one out on the market well and also to go along with that as well though like when we're talking about like those extra editions and stuff like that that's a different thing they're charging 70 and they're not giving you anything else so that's why I'm saying it's like like just do yourself the favor like I mean you you don't have to listen to anybody you can do whatever you want your adults out there like do whatever you want but like it's just it makes sense and like especially since we're talking about it being a recession and wages aren't as good as they used to be and stuff like that that means your dollar is should be even more valuable to you and because of that then maybe you need to take the time and just say hey you know what let's not get caught up in the FOMO let's just take a breath wait for the reviews to come out and see what they say see if the game is you know a game that it is actually functioning and it actually is at least something worth your money because that's really what it comes down to is you know you don't want to buy a product Saints Row and then regret it later on because it's absolute garbage you want to buy a game and be able to enjoy it and so you should at least do that much for yourself yes and who's putting down that hundred dollars for the Theatrhythm Digital Deluxe Edition but at least you know what you're getting for that you're getting like enough like content to justify the price yeah this is this is like well we just want seventy dollars because it's call of duty like yeah i mean no no thank you i mean god of war like i hear it's a great game i'm sure it's gonna be a good game do i think they need to be raising the price for that eh not really but you know what when a god of war game comes out we don't go oh it was a buggy crappy mess you know that they have to roadmap the patch at all if you can wait six months one year that game will be included in playstation's little premiere service absolutely or even better like hey you know what here's an even better idea oh i'm sorry it's just real quick building on that microsoft why aren't they a part of this conversation because they're trying to pass because the game pass exactly and at the end of the day that's where the industry is going anyway so all the this whole discussion is going to be outdated anyway because that game pass that's where the industry's going subscription i don't have to worry about seventy dollar call of duty because i get it for free with my game pass subscription if i want um i don't know like i don't we talk about this all the time like with the different things that they do like it feels like it's a broken record honestly and us talking about it is literally going to do nothing for the industry they're not going to be like oh wow i didn't think about it like that they're just they want money i mean it is going to be they're going to keep pushing it until people had enough and we'll see how far that goes seven dollars gas bobby kotick's listening right now oh oh that loki oh that loki he's got you know what we gotta we gotta fix this i will stop sexually harassing people now i've been brought to my senses i don't i don't want to laugh at that because it's not a laughing matter but uh it's it's yeah like they're they're not going to change their tone because of a couple of people with a podcast no unfortunately not all right well speaking of the house of activision blizzard they have a pretty big game coming up and that is overwatch 2 um overwatch 2 is actually coming out tuesday because today is the last full day you can play the game they're gonna take it down for a day is it overwatch tuesday actually no loki like what a missed opportunity maybe they should be listening to you at least i don't see i don't see it here maybe it is you gotta like you gotta think as a company like can we work a pun into it because that's gotta be the first question you gotta work out ever ssj100 matt in chat has the perfect two-word response for you dad stop all right anyway um overwatch 2 is launching on october 4th unlike the previous conversation overwatch 2 is going to be free to play um it's a different model than the original overwatch now yes there's going to be a battle pass system yes there's going to be other stuff that's that's built in to get your don't worry they're coming for your wallet in other ways but the base game will be free to play and as we also talked about in a prior week if you did not own the original overwatch you're going to have to earn the heroes which is going to take you a bit of time in the game but there's a rhyme and a reason for that too because you don't want these you know smurf accounts that are just created to you know raffle stomp noob teams uh so they have to put some time in to uh unlock the heroes so okay anyway but i want to talk about moderation tools because when it comes to online multiplayer games i know this news might shock you but sometimes there are toxic environments in these games and dark soccer you have something to say i was like no there's no no never no and overwatch has had its share of toxicity over the years but in all seriousness overwatch 2 is looking at some new moderation tools to look at curbing the abusive and disruptive player behavior you you will have to have a phone number linked to every account so if you want to play this game you're going to have to give them your phone number so that when you're a bad boy blizzard can call you and yell at you no that's actually not what they're doing but uh it's that whole two-factor authentication right and what's also interesting about this the game will be doing audio transcriptions of what's because we have that technology now right if you've ever been on like a zoom call or something that does the automated captions right away we're at that point where it can transcribe the show like as it's going so um which by the way we really need to look into that technology for this show i i keep meaning to do it i apologize the problem i've had with all of the ones that i've seen so far is that they tie into a singular sound source but the way this show is staged we have multiple sound sources i am on a microphone dark sakura and loki are on desktop capture so if somebody knows a captioning system that works with multiple intakes please pass it my way rob at vog network.com and i will look into implementing it because it's something that's long overdue for this show anyway that being said we know that this is something that they um do as they do the um audio transcriptions so that's going to be a part of overwatch too so if there is a reported interaction then uh it's in the audio transcript so it allows them to kind of read what happened right right there uh this is called the defense matrix which is a little tongue-in-cheek name because that is also the name of one of diva's avail abilities in overwatch um again the the phone number uh can only be linked to one account you can't use it to make another account so that's going to be easier to make it ban people i mean sure you could get a burner phone or something that isn't exactly an easy thing to do so it is going to make it a little harder that's for sure um so yeah uh blizzard said in a statement once the audio recording has been transcribed to text it's quickly deleted as the file's sole purpose is to identify potentially disruptive behavior the text file is then deleted no later than 30 days after the audio transcription for all those of you that relay confidential information over overwatch or i don't know maybe erp on overwatch's voice chat what y'all do is y'all's business i'm just saying blizzard does not plan to keep those logs unless it is reported and you're erping in front of an audience who's not consenting to that then you might be reported for that so uh that is not going to roll out the day of the launch though they're saying that will be in the weeks after launch as far as the audio transcriptions will go so um there you go uh the general chat feature is also being removed from overwatch 2 no more chat room for you to plug your twitch or say gg easy uh and that whole type of thing so um rest in piss to that feature quite frankly because i don't think any good ever came out of that feature i think there's still party chat and those sorts of things but uh the general chat is gone and no one cried that day all right like i like i mean i didn't play overwatch because the game made me motion sick as fuck but i i always liked you know a postgame chat as long as people were respectful but i understand that not everybody will be yeah like my hat oh it's coming together look at that again uh i'm sorry to the podcast listeners for the visuals we got to be careful but uh you've got your little uh pig trap or it's that's one of those um saw traps that's the movie is infamous for uh that you wow you've actually built that into a hat that's cool look at you yeah i actually ended up buying the prop because um like the the cheaper rubber mask because i wasn't gonna have time to build the whole thing but i have like a like plastic and foam nails and stuff to attach to it and i've got all the paints and everything i just needed and i actually had to cut out the gears myself it's gonna need some touch up on tuesday and then it should be assembled you're gonna get a lot of people because with all the dead by daylight streamers there'll be did i say dad by daylight dead by daylight streamers that'll be there um you're gonna get a lot of people that want a picture just make sure they take a card when they get a picture well i'm not doing the cosplay contest because this is sort of last minute but um i'm also working on my knife for for julie oh fun legion nice um but i've already got the mask part of uh of that hat done i just accidentally used gloss uh lacquer on it instead of uh matt um before we get to the next story i want to read from chat pod culture talking about the phone number requirement for overwatch says the problem with this is that they send a text to your number if you want to update your number and will not let you if you don't enter that code how can you enter the damn code if you no longer have the number to which mike def says that's why you update it but i also get it if you don't have access to the old phone anymore because you have a new phone now i know with a lot of cell phone changes yeah but hopefully blizzard has a process for that but it can be annoying when it takes multiple days and a lot of times they're like yeah send us your id and all this like personal information and get your account back and it's kind of like i shouldn't have to do that you know like just like ask me my mom's maiden name and my name of my first pet and let me reset it geez or send something to my email or verify it another way you know so but i get it that is frustrating all right anyway moving on uh we got more stories to get to so let's go to dark sakura all right so in other news there has been uh an unknown silent hill game rated in uh in the korea region um it's called the short message according to this korean rating system that's the game rating and administration committee of korea um gave a rating to an unannounced game called silent hill the short message um they don't really know what the game is or what platform it's going to be on some people think it might be like another playable teaser um or it could also be like one of their uh um like a e-game type things like one of the the little phone games um the publisher was listed as uniana um who did konami's a free to play soccer game e-football 2023 um oh no oh no oh no run away so um they uh it could be a mobile game a spin-off um but they also there there's also a thought that because uniana also does arcade cabinets that it might be an arcade game i mean there's just so much speculation out here um take it spitter take it spitter um and then of course then there were all those the the leaks of you know like the the the girl made out of pictures and some of the other things so you know the the various screenshots that were leaked so we don't we don't know um but we'll see we'll see what happens of it i mean it would be it would be nice to have a mainline silent hill game you know like a legit one but yeah we've been waiting before coaching yeah i i i would just at this way it's the same problem i have at the suikoden remaster like or i shouldn't say problem reservation i think is a better word konami's doing it in house i have reservations because konami's been a broken company for several years now so i mean maybe i i will be super happy to be wrong i know no one will be happier than me to be wrong on that and to really enjoy those c code and remasters i'm worried not every hd remaster is a good one secret of mana so even the silent hill 3-1 wasn't great because then you they lost the code so anyway mike tefton chat says silent hill a short message that message fuck you suckers uh i'm i'm on board that it's probably a modal mobile title hence the short message but um we'll see i mean i visual novel that would be kind of fun it's hard to fuck up the visual novel well i realize we talk about everything that's going on in gaming culture we have to report on things like this there is a part of me that's just like i'm just exhausted of rumors i'm exhausted of these rumors that are coming up like konami shit or get off the pot shit or get off the pot i am sick of waiting for this silent hill thing like but at the same time i say that at the same time i'm like but also take the time to make it good so i hope that when they're ready to announce this they have teamed up with the right company to rescue the franchise and only then will it have been worth the wait that company is volition moving on to our next story uh anyways um nintendo our next nintendo employee i should say has filed a lawsuit um alleging that they uh apparently that the nintendo is anti-union um which we've kind of heard this before so on april 15th there was an anonymous employee who filed a complaint against nintendo and the contracting company astin carter with the national labor relations board uh apparently they said that they were fired from nintendo um after asking about noa's stance on labor unions well right they're not gonna say yay unions um but that is technically retaliation um so you know nintendo has commented where the claim which is filed with the national labor relations board by a contractor who's terminated for disclosure of confidential information and for no other reason is what they say so it's it's a matter of you know what the contractor said versus what nintendo is saying um we'll see how that plays out but i would not be surprised that they're anti-union because there's been a lot of not great stuff coming out about nintendo over the few weeks and i think there's a lot of people that want to deny not nintendo not nintendo nintendo is a japanese based company they can't they don't have the same problems that the uh u.s based companies do and it's they have completely different problems but there exists it's it's it's a rude awakening for a lot of people that again all of these problems we have talked about at length on this show it is it is an industry-wide problem nature of really business in general i mean companies in particular don't really want to be held that accountable for the responsibility that they have to their employees and it's just a sick sad truth all right let's move on and i'm going to talk about uh this next story here uh which has to do with netflix creating their own game studio in house as you know netflix has been slowly testing the waters when it comes to games and kind of doing their own uh uh gaming service i don't think they have a lot of huge huge games on it yet but i know they have a few um but they are forming an in-house game studio the studio was built in helsinki finland to create world-class original games uh we haven't we are has we'll see we'll see uh we don't know what the games are we only know that marco lastika uh a alumnus of zinga and ea those are those are two companies that those would be two red flags right there love to see that on those county at home they will uh marco will service the director um so they're saying i know of a guy i know guy that might be able to uh join you know he's uh recently become available after uh you know the shutdown of a certain stadia that phil harrison man i i got good feelings about him growling in my heart anyway um helsinki is uh home to some good game talent at least in netflix press release they're very excited to share that next games who developed the walking dead mobile title uh netflix by the way bought them in march uh netflix also purchased other developers boss fight and night school studio who created the game oxen free uh but this you know it'll take all these studios to build something new yeah that that one i go okay that's that's a good acquisition um you're not going to see whatever this uh studio makes for years and then it will get one season and then immediately cancelled um that's just in the press no obviously i added that part but again i'm just saying netflix and google have some very similar reputations here so if anyone from netflix happens to be listening they're not but i'm going to say it anyway you have to leave things in the oven long enough for them to bake fully through and it is not going to happen the first time and if you are not ready to accept that risk then close the studio down tomorrow and give all those people very lovely packages because you wasted their fucking time if you're not willing to make that commitment don't do this yep six seasons and a movie it doesn't just apply to that other show that i know everybody's talking about this week it should apply to netflix investments in gaming you better commit to six seasons and a movie for this gaming studio that's all i have to say yep all right this what just people oh my god i'm just like i'm done okay we're gonna go to our next story by the way i need to run to the potty so i will be right back so dark soccer i guess you can relieve your may i please have a bio break we will be right no we i will be right back we will be moving on to the next story without me all right so um well e3 says they're happening again they're gonna do a show open to the public for two days on june 13th 2023 um and so it's gonna be between june 13th and june 16th at the la convention center as usual it will be open to the public starting on the 15th um and there will be partner showcases that will start on the 11th um they wanted to do a digital only one but then they said no um and now they're saying that they want to do a revitalized physical and digital e3 experience um they recruited the esa recruited help of read pop that also worked with pax egx and star wars celebration um but i i don't i don't want to deal with it i'm not going i mean and the esa is also still kind of like on shaky ground after the deal with leaking all that contact information so i don't know how i feel about it i mean honestly i kind of feel a big bunch of nothing about it but we'll see i mean it's not going to be what it used to be that's for sure i never be what it was i i still don't think you're going to have just because they're doing a physical version doesn't mean that you're going to have a lot of uh studios still coming back to it you know you still got you know intended doing their own thing ea is still probably not going to do a thing um i think activision had bowed out for a while although with microsoft that might be a little bit different scenario um yeah i just i don't know i don't know it it's not going to be the same as you remember it's basically what it is i i would like an award convention or something and i get it that they're going to have the industry thing but like i don't know i can't imagine that that's needed anymore considering that the industry has survived just as long without e3 like e3 didn't just all of a sudden you know too little to stop the plans oh we can't sell games now because e3 stopped i mean i don't think that it's needed i i'm back and and e e3 is just leaning into what everyone always assumed it was and it's just becoming another comic con another i mean literally they got the company with pax to do it which by the way is why i want nothing to do with it yeah yeah so i i you know and if you all have listened to the show long enough i don't need to get into it tonight you all know my issues with repop um and for all i know does repop produce twitch con because i'm kind of going against you know my thing i don't know if they do or not but um i it's my my desire to see my twitch friends is is greater than any grudge i have against repop but over the again this is all about what happened to me at pax east and bobby several years ago and yes i hold grudges for a very long time um but as far as the e3 show goes like this is just turning into what the show probably should have turned into eight years ago to survive um and i i just think at this point you know it's it's sure it'll come back and it probably is going to be somewhat successful it's just not going to be the same e3 from 2005 2006 and that's okay um the industry is kind of past that now so i think we just end up giving people the show they thought they were going to get last time um sj100 matt in chat says kencha hall will apparently be used for the business portion of the show kencha hall i believe is a parking lot now so i don't think they're going to put it in the parking lot um or a parking structure of some sort but i remember that there was um oh thank god dj rama says reed pop is not connected to twitch con there's still some safe things in this world um but um i'm so dramatic unnecessarily me um is it me am i the drama um uh but e3 always had two very distinct halls there was the west hall and there was north hall i think it was and like i remember south was oh south hall and west hall and nintendo was always in one and sony and microsoft were always in the other at least during the big years and so you know it was all kind of spread out and you had the traffic going back and forth but you know what there was always an industry only area anyway it was upstairs and for many years we could never get in there until the one year that we went as acknowledged gaming media uh was i think the first vog network year which was the last year that we went we went as acknowledged gaming media we got to go to some of the press events that were upstairs and let me tell you there's more stuff upstairs i mean it wasn't in giant rooms it was in think more like hotel ballrooms but still you would go into places and it'd be like they'd have kiosks of games to play that they weren't even showing downstairs because there were things that were maybe under nda or you know for whatever reason they did not want to show to the quote-unquote general public who wasn't even invited the unwashed masses yes that's a much better way of putting it the unwashed masses so i got into some when i went with krista when she was working for lucas arts yeah but that was before she moved to japan yeah so anyway i hope those that go to e3 have fun so there it is i just realized on the sidebar i completely misprinted and i said ea returns to la well maybe maybe they'll put on their show across the street again who knows i was gonna say not not at e3 but they'll probably you know they'll put out something else somewhere all right moving on uh who we on now loki yeah um so this is funny uh gamestop the company that's well known for their pre-orders are having trouble with their pre-orders apparently it's it's a mess with um shortages and negative inventory and whatnot uh because of a software change and so right now the gamestop subreddit has been flooded with different staff members complaining about computer issues ranging from their their inventory searches their pre-order histories being wiped out right before they get shipments um and apparently there's a the problem is with an sap software conversion that involves merging multiple databases together including sales customer service logistics and more yeah i know how merging databases goes that that is not fun that is not fun and it is prone to breaking um inventory system or the inventory in our systems are unreliable right now we are receiving shipments from the warehouse that do not even appear on our receiving list and so they've got us opening boxes recording the inventories emailing them back to inventory control it took me the better part of my day just to process four boxes this way that's not good um they're saying um unfortunately pre-orders became a key metric to the stores and they're being graded on uh when you cancel a pre-order it actually puts the store in a negative count when an employee said their uh theirs was negative 22 people are actually getting in trouble over this so yeah people are are um canceling their pre-orders because they were shorted on copies of nba 2k 23 and the collectible pre-orders and they didn't arrive in time and so because they're canceling the store gets penalized so then the employees get penalized for something that game stops problem i certainly hope that they don't hold those employees accountable for their mess up but they probably will and we wonder why that ship is also sinking don't we that is a ship that is halfway in the water already that is this mayday mayday all right um i want to quickly hop backwards because i was corrected by ssj100 matt and chat and i actually did not know this to be the case but uh actually linked to got the receipts and linked to the website of the la convention center where yes indeed kensha hall is still a thing that exists and that they run out and it's it's in the same place it always was so i i know i this surprises remember there's a parking lot i hooked up to kent kenshaw it connects you can see too it's very small on the screen but it says to parking ab to parking cd i'm still convinced because they do put cars in there if you look at the main website they they showed like a card show or a car show in there or something like that at one point um so there we go there's cars in kenshaw hall there so they they can bring cars in there i swear though that's what it looks like empty too i think what it is and why the confusion is there um is that there was one e3 i remember thinking oh rip kenshaw hall and you could see and we peeked through the doors and we could see there were just a bunch of cars parked in there and i was like oh it's a parking lot now so maybe they used it as a parking lot for like the booth employees or like staff or something like that it was probably like a a parking lot so that people that were working the show had a place to get right in the building or something they probably used it as that that particular year so but that's interesting thanks i mean i'm i'm happy to be wrong um so that's interesting that maybe that will be a spot so who knows um and sha100 matt says well if this e3 isn't successful the ball pit will be parked in kenshaw hall yes the ball pit will be in kenshaw hall if nothing else that's what reid pop's bringing in for the fans actually kenshaw hall will be the fan hall and it will be a cosplay competition and a ball pit and then the rest of the show will be open to industry only all right um pixel paka says for anime expo the artist alley takes place in the parking lot it's not very pleasant to be in that space though all right anyhow imagine uh let's move on to this story which has to do with the playstation loyalty program which we've talked about on this show before but we finally know that the loyalty program will be launching on october 5th it's already launched overseas in uh asia asia regions but it's going to be launching here it's playstation stars and then australian and europeans will be getting access to this on october 13th um the program is free you get some extra benefits if you're a playstation plus member uh you can access stars on the playstation app on mobile if you want you know everything that's there again there's a lot of very similar things to what you see going on um not just with microsoft's reward programs but with like the platinum points on nintendo which i got some interesting uh graphic icons and stuff this week which is cool um anyway you get rewards and playstation stars by doing activities and campaigns from like playing a game to being the first to get a platinum trophy in your region or something like that you get loyalty points and you get digital collectibles which have been clarified they are not nfts and other certain products so uh anyway i'll be i'll be curious to see what this really looks like when it rolls out and you know how they they do it in the region here and because i'd be honest i haven't been firing up my playstation 4 a lot um i've just been kind of waiting on the whole final fantasy to get a playstation 5 so the playstation is like my least used console today anyway i'm wondering if this will maybe give me some incentive to come back so we'll see all right anyhow let's move on to our next segment um when we talk about we talk about a time when um there there there was no incentive to to sign up for a loyalty program maybe you got a magazine uh but that was it we'll go into our next segment right now and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week and dark sakura what did you pick for the game this week dan picked chibi robo because i couldn't decide what to choose so chibi robo is an adventure game that first came out on the gamecube in japan on july 23rd to the 5th 23rd 2005 and in north america february 8th 2006 and in uh europe on may 20 uh 26 2006 um it was re-released also for the we in japan on june 11th 2009 so chibi robo so chibi robo um is uh an adventure platforming game done by bondi and skip limited done for the gamecube and it was originally conceived to be a point and click adventure and it was put on hold until miyamoto himself gained interest in the title and overhauled it you play as a 10 centimeter tall robot named chibi robo owned by the sanderson family and you have him going around the household and collecting happy points by doing different tasks like uh housework and solve various problems for the family and uh interact with living toys in the house action consumes energy so you have to go and recharge using outlets you carry your plug around with you um it is it's it was given to their eight-year-old daughter and the mom isn't happy about it um because of how much money the dad spends and so there's just all kinds of shenanigans i don't really want to go too much into it so basically you go around collecting happy points um you do good deeds for the family and the toys in the home and so you uh so you can also find other things to collect including moolah which is the currency and you gain happy points by cleaning up messes and disposing of trash and scrubbing footprints you can interact uh with them like i said solve problems for the family you have uh the robo television as the speaker um all kinds of interesting stuff goes on and you have three collectibles in the game one is stickers you get through the game by doing tasks or quests or mini games you get frog rings which you collect and give to jenny who's the the daughter you get happy points and stickers from that and the third is crayons which you can put in a crayon box for more happy points yeah you do have to plug into the electrical outlet or connect to the citrus soft chibi pc um and you can do that to purchase items and power ups with your moolah or scrap metal to make utilibots to help with everything going on in the house um so anyway as far as the development um it was announced in 2003 with publishing rights held by bandai um they originally wanted to do uh jean 2003 in japan in 2004 in north america um and the beta version uh had chibi robo defending the home of his inventor from burglars um and it was very different it was point and click you know like i mentioned earlier and uh you know and it just went into development hell you know limbo it was on hold and then miyamoto was like hey let's do this instead and everyone's like yeah so um the director um nishi kenny g um has other development credits uh under his belt like chrono trigger uh moon remix rpg adventure and incredible crisis i love incredible crisis um and was the right person to bring in for this um and the overall thing was that it was cheerful they wanted the experience to be cheerful no weird surprises or anything unexpected but that it would use or quote ordinary things to enhance the adventure of daily life um the music was done by uh taniguchi uh hirohumi um by doing different sound patterns and motifs for each character human voices for the system sounds um different phrases uh woodwind electronic music the music the soundtrack was really pretty awesome uh the cd uh was released with 142 page guidebook uh published by um shogakukun uh in august uh 2005 in japan um at any rate uh it was very well rated um famitsu gave it 35 out of 40 um eurogamer gave it eight eight of 10 ig and 8.2 of 10 it was really fairly decently received some of the opinions of the gameplay were a little bit mixed some people thought it was fun and rewarding and some people are just like eh and then some people like the constant sense of discovery um and found that the the difficulty level is quite flexible um uh now uh jeremy zoss of game informer was pretty displeased with it um and he said it was not a platform but more of a 3d adventure game composed entirely of fetch quest and repetitive menial labor but his opinion doesn't count um but anyway um as far as its legacy there was a sequel in 2007 for the ds called chibi robo park patrol that had a different chibi robo in a park you know fixing up a park um there was a sequel actually nintendo had a deal with walmart for the exclusive rights to the game um this another sequel in ds was okai chibi robo happy richi osoji um it was in japan 2009 with chibi robo vacuuming dirt for money in the home of an adult jenny uh the original chibi robo was re-released um as part of new play control a selection of we remakes of gamecube games um and it had special we remote uh controls for the game um there is a uh a fourth game chibi robo photo finder which was released in 2013 for 3ds and then uh the fifth game of the series was chibi robo ziplash released october 2015 for the nendo 3 nintendo 3ds um and i i didn't get to play this i watched people play it i actually think i played like a little bit of the japanese version but i always thought it was really cute and i love just how adorable our little mascot is i actually you know got the uh the amiibo just because i thought he was so cute um but yeah um it it was fairly well received by people with taste and there you go that's your classic game is chibi robo all right chibi robo the classic game of the week now um before we get back to the show i want to read some comments from chat this first one about the pick um ssu 100 matt in chat says the narrative in my mind of how this conversation went down for this pick was uh jamie yelling from across the house dan game of the week pick now and dan fuck i don't know chibi robo actually isn't too far from hell it's like it's like you live there we were at a wedding and we had just finished a wedding and dan wasn't feeling so great so we were getting to the car to say what we were going to do and i was like oh crap i haven't thought of a classic game dan pick one um what's the criteria 10 years old or older i want something maybe 2000s and he's like have you done chibi robo i don't know check the wiki no all right we'll do that one good job that's really it and thank you to the people that maintain the wiki for giving a resource that we in turn refer to quite often and making sure we don't duplicate um let's say some other comments on the game dart totsuya says never played it but a cute concept for sure uh fifth dream says reminds me a little of katamari damashi style wise yeah uh pixel pakas is a fan saying chibi robo is fantastic so there you go your classic game of the week good pick pass our pass our compliments to dan all right and then thanks man and then make him buy you a coffee all right you did buy me a coffee so he knows he knows all right all right moving on by penera let's talk about some other news going on in the industry but fast it's rapid fire news loki yes there's a fun fan game that's been um not released but it these footage of it has been put out by reimagine games it's a youtube channel they are making i'm assuming they're making a project in unreal engine the learn unreal engine and so they decided to make a super mario game with a realistic chris pratt in it it looks just like you would think it would look like you know it's got all realistic graphics and it looks like chris pratt dressed up like mario um they even have a trailer that they did like the movie guy voice in and stuff it's pretty funny no actual games in a world uh i don't remember if it was in a world but maybe in a minus world in a world yeah um i don't think that they're necessarily releasing uh a version of this game right now uh it's more of kind of you know chronicling their development of it probably a good idea because you an untenable sue um but yeah it looks funny so i'll have to check it out as it you know comes around remember we have the teaser trailer for the movie coming out in four days i can't wait so can wait yes and speaking of waiting uh you're gonna wait a little bit longer for skull and bones because that has been delayed as well uh now it is coming out on march night 2023 it's been delayed again no pirate no pirating for you you'll just have to continue to sail in the boat in assassin's creed odyssey instead of having a new pirate game to uh play yep uh dark sakura so um well magical drop four has been announced for the switch and it's going to be out in the the win the the the the the winter it'll be out uh for oh weird okay i think you mean six yeah i do that's okay you said four i can't brain okay roman numerals it's hard work no life is hard see you need a coffee do i know you or what i already had one i need another um anyway uh magical drop six is going to be out um it will have more than 15 playable characters with their own story music tracks a local online multiplayer modes uh different challenges six solo game modes and much more and it looks like magical drop the end there it is sorry i i let the little snap sound came through because i was trying to get to the trailer because i saw dgrama s and mind losing his chat or sorry saw dgrama s losing his mind in chat and i was like oh i better i better show off that yes this this is real magical drop six is a is a real thing that's happening i love this is probably my favorite puzzle game series on that came from like the snk neo geo kind of days and that stuff so um wish that that i actually i think i have it on dreamcast there's the actual gameplay there we go so it looks it looks the same as it always has except it's a little more cartoony and less pixely this time that's really how it looks all right um let's continue on and talk about uh playstation plus giveaway games if you are on the playstation plus you get your monthly games and you get to get hot wheels unleashed for playstation 5 and playstation 4 it's an arcade sim based on the hot wheels universe not to be confused with the hot wheels world and forza because that's a microsoft product well it looks just as good though it's pretty i mean maybe not as good as the fours one but it's it's a decent game it's still pretty good on playstation 4 you can check out injustice 2 which of course is the sequel to injustice from the creators of mortal combat but it's with dc characters and less fatalities uh and then also super hot on playstation 4 is also going to be given away we do not know the extra and premium games yet uh which would be the like retro stuff so we'll uh stay tuned for that over on the xbox side of the house uh there are two games that are being given away because remember they're no longer doing um xbox 360 games they are ending that so now it's just two games instead of four but for the whole month you

subscription services loki what's coming out uh alfred hitchcock vertigo nintendo switch uh playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one xbox uh series i think that was delayed from last week because i know i

man's context is very bad especially when i've been playing death stranding and that little baby's name is bb anyway i yeah uh no man's sky coming on nintendo switch this week oh that means a new patch for no man's sky because they're doing a 4.0 patch for the switch version so something i'm not going to get to play because twitch con that's all right yeah uh nickelodeon kart racers 3 slime speedway on pc nintendo switch playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one xbox series i'm pissed that slime is a part of their branding and moose will not be a playable character in this game i guarantee it yes i don't see moose listed on the list of playable characters lisa ruddy's probably not there either disgusting no the i'm trying i think it's all cartoon from 80s nickelodeon in there uh well fucking the little mannequin from today's special i can um i can give you there's a powder toast man um that's for 90s um there's purple reptar ren i'm assuming stimpy is also in there we have um susie carmichael from rugrats um all right i don't care go to the next game i'm not buying this game garfield i'll give you garfield oh oh i'm glad oh so it's a crossover from garfield cart that's

forward to uh haku oki shinkai tenon no shu in a regular and a special edition comes out this week um you also have no man's sky gets a release on the switch in japan this week as well it's uh even though it's not translated uh it is still getting a localized release in japan uh and then that near automata port for the switch is also coming out in japan and then we have touch detective rina and the fungi case files which i think was on loki's list is also out in japan this week going over to the playstation 5 uh no man's sky also gets a japanese release on the playstation 5 this week i find that interesting i didn't realize the game wasn't out there before otherwise that's kind of neat uh no more heroes 3 is also out on the playstation 5 this week so check it out dark soccer in europe we have on the fourth the following um alfred hitchcock vertigo um which all i care about this game is if they keep the same type of opening credits that saw bass designed just saying he's my artistic hero um we also have dakar desert rally for playstation and xbox on switch we have my universe pet clinic panda edition on the fourth we have let's sing abba for the big three oh shit i gotta get that yeah ready to import i know right i wish i hope it comes out here it might not it may just not be notable enough to have made loki's list not talked about garfield i'm pretty sure it'll be on the list fair on on the sixth uh for switch we have near automata the end of your uh yorha edition on the seventh uh for switch we have a chaos double pack um we have lol surprise bbs born to travel on the three um and on the seventh for playstation and switch we have no man's sky and then we also have train uh train life a railway simulator for playstation and xbox there you go all right you know it's eventually coming out though um on switch according to this uh taiko no tatsujin rhythm festival yeah i think that was out in japan last week of the week before so yeah it's been a lot over here in the us like yeah last week i think this week for the us i think it just caught my eye yeah all right um let's continue on we have some more stories for y'all and then we're gonna get to uh your calls and uh other participation with the show so let's get to it uh loki will go to you with another story yes it's exciting times indeed so walmart has joined the metaverse in roblox that's right you can play walmart world in roblox and i caught my kids playing them or i'm sorry walmart land gosh walley world would be weird um so walmart land and walmart's universe of play um have launched on roblox um and it's basically it's like a little hub that they have like yes advertisements for walmart things uh it's basically just a bunch of little mini games in there for kids but uh yeah it's a thing now all right i had a trailer for it and and my kids played it and i caught him and now he will be forever shamed shame clank uh bobby black and chat says i saw that on the e-shop and that's okay i already have kmart world in vr chat uh honest me a lot of like uh home i guess uh michkins and chat says uh shares my sentiment uh dart to see shares my sentiment i don't want to visit walmart in real life why would i want to go in game i don't know oh bobby's saying the e-shop comment was about taiko oh okay my bad got it a little delayed there all right um oh and you can unlock they they coined a phrase and i hate it already um you can unlock virch it's virtual merch virch is never gonna happen stop trying to make birch happen it's not happening all right let's move on uh dark sakura what do you have for us so the cutest of cute costumes is going to be available um on october 9th but it's not for people it's for dogs or cats if you're creative um they are going to be doing a rush costume as in rush from mega man it will be over at halloweencostumes.com for 35 bucks ouch but it's a fairly deluxe one and it's super cute and it would piss midna off if i got her one no more tacos for that cat she's going to be rush but if you order it um on there um you should be able to get it well in time for halloween all right do you uh do you know anyone with a pet that might want to dress up with this we could put mr smush in one again might be a little big for mr smush you know who's getting fat is cheddar extra small okay well maybe that i guess that would work if it fits like a tiny little yappy dog then it might fit mr smush that's for sure yeah i think that midna would wear like a small i mean she's just got that that cat belly you know yeah i linked a picture of it in chat just so everyone could could see it it's absolutely cute it's like i see esta 100 mad is like i'll have to check that out for my dog and then saw it and was like nope can't do that to my dog it does look a little intricate you have to have a good doggy to do that i immediately to tiara oh i didn't even know they had a dog yeah they have uh several dogs you know they have the hobbit dogs oh yeah that's right i have that silly me yeah it was uh bilbo is the old man and then well uh i think there's just mary left well if they end up buying that to model it for the dogs or to have the dogs model it i would be a very uh intrigued to see that so sure for sure all right uh moving on an update to a story that just won't quit right loki yep so apparently that suspected uh 17 year old boy that they caught in oxfordshire had denied in court it was like a special youth court that he had used his phone to gain access to rockstar's private files and servers so he's pleading basically not guilty and also he was charged with two counts of breach of bail conditions and two counts of misuse of a computer so apparently he's i guess known by them to be hacking this maybe he's already in trouble i don't know but um they have yet to confirm the i if there's a connection between this person and the leak or if it was just maybe they have a different person that's also hacking people or something like that we'll see i guess all right um moving on and i think this is the last story we have slotted for tonight uh we have another pc port of a playstation game this one's a little bit surprising i didn't think uh sony was still gonna keep pushing this game but i guess i'm pleasantly surprised about it it's the uh original launch title for the playstation 5 sack boy a big adventure it's coming out uh on the pc for on october 27th it will be out on steam and the epic game store ironically enough this is not long after the uncharted collection is uh doing the same thing uh the pc version will support 4k it's gonna have a targeted frame rate of 120 frames of excuse me 120 frames a second and you can what's that it just seems unnecessary it does but hey for those of you that love your tech you know pushing the limits enjoy uh it also supports this is interesting too different screen ratios including 21 by 9 so if you have a wide screen monitor um sack boy will support that so that's kind of neat uh it will also support haptic feedback and dynamic triggers if you have a dual sense controller you can also play with a mouse and keyboard because that would be the right thing to do uh with a pc port so uh the uncharted legacy of thieves collection is uh set to hit pc steam and epic store on october 19th also of note spider-man miles morales is supposed to land by the end of the year we just don't know the exact date for that yet so all right uh anyhow this brings us to the part of the show where we encourage you all to participate if you want to join us and of course you can always join us throughout the week as well on our discord server vog network.com slash discord that's vog network dot com slash discord but if you're listening live on this sunday night as we tape on twitch uh you can head over to the green room on our discord server and we'll be taking calls uh if anyone chooses to call in meanwhile i usually check in with our mailbag i'm actually not sure we got mail tonight um but i'll check participate at orange launch radio.com is the place to send emails praise uh um space balls we ain't got shit i thought that was the case so uh please send us an email for a future week if you'd like participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send an email um so i will open it up as well for chat questions if you have anything you want to ask us in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network uh please ask it before we wrap things up for the night let me check in with loki and see if he has any last minute stories i don't have anything wow all right well bobby is sending a link and saying did this get mentioned and uh oh apparently uh the playstation five let me actually show this tweet on stream here oh is this wait i need to make sure i don't think bobby would do this but i'm making sure this isn't like a um you know uh rickroll or something okay it's not so okay so let me show this on the other screen here is uh apparently the playstation five has been jailbroken according to this tweet so this could be very interesting uh oh what do you know hackers gonna do their thing right so there's actually a video here uh from the user account man fight dragon who actually shows the uh jailbreaking in progress uh on the playstation five doesn't really show like the specifics and of course now that i'm trying to show it the video is buffering all over the place but it does show that it runs um other stuff and uh as jonathan is saying someone put pt on a playstation five it's a kernel exploit and webkit vulnerability and you if you have firmware 4.03 uh it'll run it apparently so interesting neat neat what people won't do right well i mean if they'll put doom on a toaster they're gonna try to jailbreak the playstation five it seems logical just so they can put so they can put doom on it and other retro games they can put pt back and pt yeah that's the big one that's not that's not a surprise that's one of the first just doing the logs look yeah exactly right all right well i don't see anyone in the green room and we don't have last minute stories i think i think we just wrap it up for the night and that's okay we've had some long shows the past couple weeks so tonight's a little shorter and that's all right we're gonna have a lot of fun at twitch con this coming weekend and uh have a lot to talk about in two weeks when we come back um so i hope uh everybody has a great time gaming this week and so forth if you're going to be at twitch con please reach out to dark soccer or myself on twitter uh myself over at mr rob roberts that's m r rob roberts and of course dark sakura over at dark sakura on twitter so yes um i will be there yeah reach out to us and uh say hi because i love to meet people at conventions um so anyhow it's making me sad to launch stadia right now oh i'm sorry are you gonna do like a big farewell in early january or are you like i'm moving on now and just leaving stadia behind you know what i am gonna do it i mean i'm gonna have to prep oh my god the stadia window even looks different oh interesting i guess not even loading why aren't you loading all right it's loading now that was weird but but yeah anyway um gosh um but yeah you know i um i'm gonna probably do like a uh stadia countdown stream who knows it'll be fun that would be yeah that would be pretty fun it would be one of those one of those things a little a little bittersweet but you know we'll do a proper send-off a 21 gun salute 21 hook salute all right uh anyhow real quick before i let jamie say your goodbyes i want to thank everybody of course for listening to orange launch radio if you enjoyed what you heard here at olr please tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need more voices to put out on air um so uh a nice five star review on a site like itunes or spotify or wherever it is you found this podcast goes an awful long way as well and of course we appreciate all the follows at our network channel over at vog network that's vog network on twitch but all the social media really as well including tick tock soon eventually so but the counts there now if you want to follow it um all right uh dark soccer let me give you your final thought before you go play one of your final stadia streams if if anyone is going to be at disneyland on the 10th and wants to attend lunch with me i have an extra spot open for the carnation cafe come see me that's a generous offer i wish i could go i'm not paying for him i just have the open seat i wish i had uh scheduled things better with twitch com but it is what it is i have a lot going on at work anyway i don't want to miss too much so anyway later taters have a good one see you next time we'll see you in two weeks dark sakura all right well meanwhile while dark soccer gets set up for her stream loki what is your final thought for the night i can't wait to talk about the new minecraft live stuff that's gonna be happening on the 15th so you know by the time we get our next show sounds good uh looking forward to hearing about it uh and my final thought is um i don't i don't have a lot i'll just say um on my personal stream i plan to do some streaming on monday and wednesday i'm thinking splatoon 3 tomorrow if i haven't used capture card on my new machine so if everything goes okay with that i'll do some splatoon 3 tomorrow probably some dead by daylight on wednesday and then um twitch con with this weekend so i'm just really looking forward to going and um uh just hanging out with some broadcasters that i've gotten to know in the past couple years as i myself have become a little more um immersed with twitch culture and so forth so um i hope uh hope it's a good time i'm sure it will be um i'm very happy alan is going with me and so we get to have a little bit of a vacation uh as well so that'll be really cool so excited for that because we're not just doing twitch con like one of my really good friends also moved to san diego right before the pandemic so we're gonna go hopefully see him one day so we get to you know we get to sample a little bit of san diego i the last time i was in san diego was a ddr tournament i think even before the show started i think yeah because i was with my ex at the time who i wasn't with when olr started so uh it was a long time ago his family was in san diego so i haven't been to san diego over 20 years so i'm excited to finally go back and uh have some fun so all right um that is it i hope you all have a wonderful week uh we'll see you in two weeks with an all-new olr uh so we will not be here on october 9th but we will be back on the 16th have a good night everybody we'll see you next time bye-bye
