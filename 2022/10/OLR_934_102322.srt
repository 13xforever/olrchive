1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
prepare to file more Joy-Con drift warranty replacements, break out your free Nintendo gloves, and get ready to play Mario Party 1 again!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I have vivid memories of wrecking both my palm and analog sticks playing Mario Party 1's minigames.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Once GoldenEye is available too, we're going to be gaming like it's 1999.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Maybe it's a good thing I haven't managed to buy Nintendo 64 controllers for the Switch yet.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is my rose-tinted glasses story.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 934 of our program for tonight.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:08,000
October the 23rd of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am here every week to talk about the latest and greatest, greatest, greatest, greatest, greatest games with my co-hosts.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Although clearly I trip over my own words quite frequently. Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hi.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello, hello. How are you?

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm dealing with stuff. Still fighting a losing battle with my voice.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, my voice is in a weird place too. I feel like I might have caught a cold when I hosted that show, but like it's certainly not the big one because I've had that more than enough times at this point.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So yeah, I just feel like a little sinacy. I don't know how to put it, but my voice still doesn't feel 100% tonight, which is weird.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've been dealing with this since TwitchCon and then before that when I had that bad cough, my voice was going and I'm wondering if I haven't done some kind of long term damage.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh yikes, I hope not.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, this is about as much voices as I've had now for the last couple of days and it wears off pretty, pretty quickly. So I'm, I'm working with my doctor on it. I think it's that I've missed work and I'm out of sick time.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So I mean, I'm on I'm on a temporary leave, which means I'm protected. But at the same time, I'm not getting paid. So I'm gonna talk to my doctor and see if this gets me on like some type of short term disability or something until we figure out what's going on.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Fair enough. Go to our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific over at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network or VOG network.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And you can catch us right after the Bobby Blackwell show on Sunday nights and chat along with our program where Jessiks is saying grapes equals wine, making a play on what when I said the grape is earlier.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Pod culture says, man, Rob must have been drinking before the show. Not tonight, oddly enough. No, I know my shirt is grape colored tonight. But no, I am I'm surfeitly pober tonight. And I yeah, I don't know what to blame, but myself. You know, I'm new at this actually. I'm new to Twitch actually and streaming. This is our first

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Twitch. Yeah, this is our first, you know, podcast. So please be actually I can't say that. This is the first podcast I've ever done. It's just still going all these years later.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Technically, but not the first show you've done.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No, not the first show I've done, but the first podcast. Yeah. All right. Also say hello, of course, to someone who I think it's his first podcast as well. Say hello to tech master or should I say Minecraft master Loki.

27
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hello, I'm getting title changes today.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Maybe I don't know why not. I'm messing everything else up. Why don't I change up titles to

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You've you've you've evolved.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's true. Well, let me ask this. I know we're not into the gaming weeks yet. But did you play anything but Minecraft this week?

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So is my title incorrect?

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It is correct.

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, I know a game you must be thinking about playing is Silent Hill 2. I see that playing in the background there. So I wonder what could be influencing that pick tonight.

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I couldn't think of anything to put in there except for, you know, Silent Hill, I guess.

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, no, I mean,

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
it was, you know what I was hovering over before I picked Silent Hill 2?

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What's that?

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yaris.

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, okay. Well, yeah, didn't that didn't wasn't there something about like that just hit its anniversary of some sort? Was it like the 10 year anniversary or something in that game just recently?

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't know.

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It was recently in the media again recently. I don't remember why. But I mean, you would think most people forgot about Yaris.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We have to remember our mistakes so that we don't repeat.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why do you keep reminding me that it existed?

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I think I think it's the internet reminding us that Yaris is now eligible to be a classic game of the week, I think.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:05,000
All right. Let's get into Okay, so we brought up Silent Hill 2. Let's get into some of the big news from this week. You know, we talked about it last week because we knew there was an announcement of an announcement coming.

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But this week, we actually got the announcements when it comes to Silent Hill.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Dark Soccer, I know this is a series you're a fan of as well.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Tell us a little bit about the Silent Hill direct or transmission or the heck they called it was a direct Come on.

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh, Lord, there's a lot of stuff that came out with Silent Hill and to go ahead and start with it.

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I want to talk about the movie.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They've got Christoph Ganz coming back to do a direct sequel based off of Silent Hill 2.

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You know, I guess with some updates here and there because there is some pretty dated content in the original game.

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But I like the quote on here that Ganz said the film tells the story of young guy coming back to Silent Hill where he has known a great love and what he's going to find is a pure nightmare.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And of course, we'll see the Red Pyramid.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I like how he says I was talking about the Red Pyramid thing, you know, the guy with the helmet.

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's actually cute.

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So now I know that the other sequel was based on Silent Hill 3 and I liked it for what it was.

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But it wasn't great.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I would like to see an actual Silent Hill 3 retelling in the order that they're doing like this is going to be an official Silent Hill 2 movie.

61
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I want an official Silent Hill 3 movie, you know, that type of thing.

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So also going up there's Bloober.

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What a silly name.

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But they're doing a Silent Hill 2 remake is a timed PS5 console exclusive, and I don't know what I what I think about it.

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
PC.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty, but I mean, I'm trying to get a better look at James's face.

67
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I mean, it looks like it could be really, really good, but I'm not a fan of Bloober's track record.

68
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You know, they made James kind of hot.

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Like they gave him a new voice.

70
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's pretty, but it's no enhanced edition.

71
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I mean, sheer quality that was.

72
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I was trying to play a little bit of the trailer here for those watching on Twitch, and I actually accidentally got audio coming through.

73
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Sorry about that.

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He does look really good, I have to say.

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But the what I'm most impressed with is the level of expression on his face.

76
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Like he actually looks like he's feeling like actual pain and confusion.

77
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And, you know, and also Red Pyramid looks really good.

78
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But I wonder if he has a tongue.

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's a really good point about the expression.

80
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You know, I didn't even really think about that when I was kind of joking, because, you know, Shane and I were texting about this all week.

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And he didn't agree with me that I was like, James got hot.

82
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He did agree with me, but it didn't pick either.

83
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He's very particular, aren't we all a little bit, but it didn't occur to me.

84
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But when you said that, I'm like, Oh, I think you're right on the money with that is that by kind of doing a recapture of him.

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So just why they probably don't even have the code for the original game or whatever.

86
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They probably have motion captured now anyway.

87
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But to do that, you're right.

88
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Like Jamie, when she says you're capturing the emotion because some of these scenes, especially like the mirror scene.

89
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And you know, some of the scenes near the end without giving anything away are very emotional.

90
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And the fact that they can like capture that in the face in a way that Silent Hill 2, you know, the PS2 couldn't do the same way.

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Like, I think that's going to be huge for this game.

92
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's a really good point you bring up.

93
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Well, funny, though, when you started saying that it was right after I made the tongue comment.

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Because we all know about Pyramid Head's tongue, right?

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah. So I'm I'm curious.

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, then it was supposed to come out of this little hole in the thing.

97
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Side note, going to Dead by Daylight.

98
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
On Pyramid Head's model in Dead by Daylight, that part of his helmet has been bolted down, but the tongue is rendered.

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Interesting.

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah. Anyway, that's it for Silent Hill slash Dead by Daylight trivia.

101
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There's also Silent Hill Ascension, which is a choose your own adventure sort of streaming series.

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hmm. So, well, you want to bring it back to DBD? I believe behavior is involved with that one.

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes, behavior is involved with it.

104
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But nothing to do with the four versus one game. It's just coincidence.

105
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's interactive. I wonder if it's going to be like some AR thing or if it's going to be like a group vote to see what happens next or

106
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
it says audience members can work together to impact the story at every turn.

107
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So I wonder if it's going to be like a big, like massive voting thing.

108
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah, I it seems like a very ambitious thing because a part of me is kind of like, well, is it like a until dawn type of approach?

109
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You know, where like you pick things in it, but it with the live chat, it really seemed like, oh, they're doing but I don't know, it would seem kind of

110
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't want to say I don't want to use a lot of negative words. But like, I'm not sure I like the idea of just like the internet votes and we do that thing. Is that really innovative?

111
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Like I wonder if there's a more to it.

112
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I wonder if it isn't now you know, it would be innovative.

113
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If that chat is like you the Twitch streamers Twitch chat influences your story and what's happening. That's a little more innovative to me.

114
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But we I mean, the reality is we don't know we did the same thing with the quarry. Yeah, yeah.

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
A lot of streamers did. Yeah, that's true. That's true. So we don't know a lot right now, but it looks interesting.

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think it's gonna be be pretty neat. If you want to give your comments on the next feature.

117
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Sure. Let's talk a little bit about Silent Hill F. So I don't know if y'all saw the trailer, let me put it up on the other screen. But so there's another Silent Hill that's going to be coming another game that they announced and it really, it doesn't have anything to do with the other games. So it's not like a remake or, you know, spin off or any of that, but it's, it's a whole new story.

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And instead of being set in a, you know, Centralia, Pennsylvania type of town or whatever, it's it's actually Japan in the 1960s. And, you know, in the trailer, we don't see Pyramid Head, but we see like the, you know, kind of something's wrong with her scary schoolgirl carrying like an iron pipe or something.

119
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And then you see this very interesting, like floral character towards the end of the video and her face falls off and it's very scary. So I gotta say I, I liked artistically where this was going. I have no idea what the F the game is. That's, that's maybe why they call it Silent Hill F because we don't know what the F the game is.

120
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,200
I liked when the announcement was in the stream. Everyone was like F's in chat.

121
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:46,680
Well, and then my other joke was I sure hope they put out an art box for Silent Hill F, the Silent Hill F art box, but we'll see. Alright, anyway, now that I've shown that I'm 12 years old. Anyhow, yeah, Silent Hill F, we don't know when it's coming out. But we do know some of the names that are associated with this, even if you don't know who they necessarily are, because a lot of streamers when they saw that the writer of the game was Ryukishi07 were like, Who? Who's that?

122
00:12:47,360 --> 00:13:16,800
Well, you know, you probably may not know who Ryukishi07 is over here. But they did works on series such as When They Cry, Higurashi When, When They Cry, Umoniko When They Cry. And then I guess Higurashi is like a cult following of sorts has one of those online. So they're like a known like visual novel kind of artist, at least in Japan. And so I'm assuming maybe those you on the convention circuit and those that follow the Japanese culture and media a little

123
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:36,200
closer than than I do necessarily probably recognize the name. And then the creature and character design is by Kira in the trailer. So it is kind of interesting that it does seem to be some new names and some new blood pun intended into the Silent Hill franchise. But part of what makes me happy about the Silent Hill

124
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:58,320
Direct, like, number one, the whole thing had a low bar to begin with. Let's be real. So the fact that yes, Konami has given Silent Hill 2 to Bloober. They gave Silent Hill F to another studio. It's not being made internally. Who is making this one? Darn it. I forgot the name. But it was they I think they did like, the resident

125
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:28,080
code something. Yeah, they did. No code. It was no code. Yeah, they did the spin off games Resident Evil, the multiplayer stuff. So they haven't done like huge profile things. But I think that's interesting. And then we had of course, you know, we talked about that the one dark soccer just talked about was, you know, behavior entertainments evolved there. There's another one we didn't get into Silent Hill transmission. I think it was called the one that Annapurna is publishing that the developers of Oh, God, what was that scary horror game with the computer had like the 80s

126
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:57,920
graphics. I need to look in chat because you guys are going to know this. Yeah, Annapurna is more like a publisher. And Rama. So Rama who does follow Japanese culture a lot closely, mentioning that Oh, this is the person behind Higurashi. Rama says in chat, you are in for a tweet, especially if you like mind fucks. Well, you know, Silent Hill fans, they tend to like mind fucks. So this is gonna be pretty fucking good. It sounds like Thank you

127
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:27,880
Mike Deaf to remember the name of the game Stories Untold. So it's by the developer of Stories Untold is doing the transmission game. So yeah, this is what I wanted. I wanted Konami to take one of their big IPS and say, you know what, we don't know how to make games anymore. So we're gonna bring in outside talent to make games. And that's great. Honestly, this makes me excited for a Castlevania Direct, to be quite honest. I hope there's big things in store for that franchise next.

128
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:47,480
Now, was I completely like bouncing off the walls and ceilings at what I saw? No, because in all of these previews, we didn't see a single lick of gameplay in any of them. None of them showed gameplay, not even Silent Hill 2 showed gameplay. I mean, that's probably

129
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,200
Well, it's sort of, they sort of kind of showed what it would look like, because it's gonna be different camera.

130
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,840
It was in engine, but we don't know for sure. But,

131
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,200
Right. Yeah, but Akira Yamaoka.

132
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,280
Yeah, no.

133
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,120
Doing new music.

134
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:17,440
There's a lot of things to be very happy about. And I'm feeling a lot more positive about this than I was going into it. I don't want to make big proclamations that are too, too big, bigger, bigger than I trust Konami to fill into.

135
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:32,240
But I hope with as much bullshit. Well, I shouldn't use that word because it's all been deserved. So with as much shit as Konami has rightfully gotten online in the past few years for the direction their company has taken in many directions.

136
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:42,680
I hope this is a sign that someone at the top finally heard the fucking message. And this is the start of a new creative direction for Konami.

137
00:16:42,680 --> 00:17:03,920
I really, really hope again, I feel like I'm putting big pants out there that I'm not sure these business folks at Konami really know how to fill but I'm gonna hope I'm gonna wish thoughts and prayers that this is the beginning of a bold for them new creative direction for Konami and that would be that would make me very happy.

138
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:28,760
By the way, that what I'm saying that completely set because I know some of you will be like, but the arcade games are doing fine and DDR is great and sound voltage. I please a reminder. Konami's arcade division, which is the same as the slot machines that the pachinko's they're doing just fine. So all of that I'm not touching I'm talking about Konami home entertainment, who's doing the console games.

139
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:55,800
Yo, case set is gone, girl. They're gone. So you know, they shut all those offices down. So if this is the start of a new creative direction for Konami's and how they they plan to approach home entertainment. I'm very excited. So Questbuster in chat says I'd rather have Konami ask others to do something with their Titanic library of IP than wait for them to do it themselves. Yes to that.

140
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:25,680
Dark Tetsuya says yeah, I get you the criticism is towards the home division, whatever's less left of that. Yes, very much that part. Honestly, honest to God. Let's all be thankful. There was no mobile game announcement in this direct. There was no NFT game announcement in this direct. There was a you know, there's there's a lot of things to celebrate in this. So so let's let's take a moment to give let's get let's all take a moment to give some polite golf claps to

141
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:41,760
Konami for this silent is it being picked up by polite golf claps to Konami for this potentially creative new direction. And let's hope the games don't suck. But I you know what, out of all of them, one of them's got to be good.

142
00:18:41,760 --> 00:19:10,000
Right? Yeah, I mean, and it's, they've kind of tried with like other game with their franchises already. They've tried several times have failed. So I'm hopeful that multiple different studios are going to be able to, you know, do this. I was sad to see I understand the reasoning because you know, they're never going to apologize. But sad to see though, that we still don't get a Kojima game, but it's fine.

143
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:39,640
Well, you know, on one hand, I think it could be very interesting for Kojima to have a Microsoft game. Because that appears to be the direction it's going in with the whole cloud and whatever it is he wanted to do with Stadia. But Stadia decided we'd rather make bad business decisions all day. So despite the fact that we have some pretty good technology, we're just gonna like make really bad decisions on how to use it. And so now Kojima is going to x cloud, I guess the second suitor. And

144
00:19:39,640 --> 00:20:09,400
what you know, the runner up and doing his game there. I think that could be very interesting to have, you know, whatever scary, assumably thing he's doing there with the cloud, sort of to compete with the exclusiveness of Silent Hill two on PlayStation five. It just, I think I just, as a fan of all of the gaming companies, I'm glad that Microsoft is getting some serious, like, Japanese credit with having Kojima working with them, I think could be very interesting for the future.

145
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:32,040
What Xbox looks like. So we'll see. Yeah. All right, dark to see it says we are in the market for a series s. So we should be prepared for whatever Kojima is cooking up lol. And we again, we're assuming that that game is going to be exclusive. But if it's true that it leverages cloud technology, maybe in a way that Sony isn't quite set up to do yet, then yeah, I think it's probably it's gonna be a

146
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,000
a Microsoft, Microsoft now.

147
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,720
I love that PlayStation now. It's cutting edge PlayStation one technology.

148
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:52,920
I keep saying Xbox exclusive, but let's be real like Microsoft, a game pass for PC is a very real thing. And I believe whatever is put out will be a Microsoft exclusive, I think is a better way to put it.

149
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:02,680
Exactly. In the in the end, these console wars, you know what know the true winners are PC players. Because it's just like, I get everything. It's all good.

150
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:32,600
Having just bought this new PC, I'm eating so good these last few months when it comes to gaming. Like I, I don't even know right now if I need to get a PlayStation five, I'm gonna get what Alan and I were just talking about this yesterday. Because we were at Target. And I sort of, here's, here's the question Alan asked. So you know what he's thinking about? He said, Hey, what happened to the talk of you getting a PlayStation five? Is that like a holiday thing that you're going to try to do? So you know, you get which is very sweet that Alan's thinking about

151
00:21:32,600 --> 00:22:02,480
that. But I'm like, well, I've sort of been holding off to see if they do a refresh. And I also am really holding off to see what happens when Final Fantasy 16 comes out. Because if they're going to do like a limited edition PlayStation five with like a Final Fantasy 16 controller or a Final Fantasy 16, you know, box or something like, I fucking want that I want that, like, and I'll, I'll have Shane get it for me. Because if anyone can win those fucking limited inventory games, it's him. And I'll be like, Shane, please, please, please, he'll do it. Because once

152
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:16,480
when he wants to be nice, he's nice. So he'll get me one of those. That's, that's where I want to go. By the way, didn't make our show world tonight. But since I brought it up, there was a new Final Fantasy 16 trailer this week. Did any of you see the new Final Fantasy 16 trailer?

153
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,160
Nope.

154
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,680
I read a bit about it.

155
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:39,040
Oh, it looks so good. Looks so I'm so like, now here, here's where I'm setting the bar too high is Final Fantasy 16. But it's so what, in my opinion, one of the best parts of Final Fantasy 14 was when you had a summon or you know that basically there's a part in the Heavens

156
00:22:39,040 --> 00:23:08,960
Word content, I won't give you the context. So let's tell you what happens. Shiva, who you all know, is an infamous Final Fantasy summon, fights Ravana, who's one of the unique summons, basically, that was built for the Final Fantasy 14 universe, but he's really good. They fight each other. And Shiva in the storyline is actually has like a human for a host, or actually, I think she's technically an elf, but you know, just just put put high fantasy logic

157
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,600
into this. Okay.

158
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,360
Shenanigans.

159
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:38,360
Yeah. Shiva's in the body of what is otherwise, you know, a normal, you know, walker around the planet, so forth. So my point is, but she fights Ravana. It feels like they've made an entire game out of what was the coolest sequence in Final Fantasy 14 was those two summons fighting each other. So and it feels like you need to look at this new trailer, it's very much Oh, the summonings are living in people. And then they come out to fight each other. Like that seems to be where the story is going. But it's all Game of Thrones.

160
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:54,120
And very violent. Holy shit, like the newest trailer, like has a decapitated head like full. I mean, it's not it's cropped just enough where you don't see gore, but it's very clear what's happening. And it's like, you don't see this in a Final Fantasy game, usually. So

161
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,160
the tagline heads will roll.

162
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:23,880
Yeah, heads will roll Final Fantasy 16. So anyway, I'm very excited about that. Yeah. Why not? All the other headlines we're missing tonight. Mike Deft points out there's also new Pokemon Scarlet Violet news. Yes. I believe the media, the more mainstream media and the Pokemon influencers of the world because I know some streamers and some, you know, big Pokemon specific sites got to have like a one hour hands on with Gen nine and a lot of those impressions are

163
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:52,840
hitting the internet this week. What we're not seeing is what the third evolution of the starter forums look like. But we're getting some insight as to how the games actually were. I mean, there was there was no question I was gonna buy Gen nine. If they had come out and said it's literally just Gen eight with new Pokemon, I would have still bought it. You know why? Because I like Gen eight. So I'm all about it. I'm very excited. Yeah, there's this dude. Gosh, why don't we just why don't we just let chat pick all the news for us tonight? No, it's fine.

164
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:22,440
Bobby Black Wolf actually brings this up. And this was something I noticed too, speaking of Final Fantasy. Awesome games done quick, the game list has come out, not the full schedule, just the list of what games they're going to do. And guess what Final Fantasy 14 is going to be an awesome games done quick. How do you speed run an MMO? They are doing a very specific mode, they're doing something called Palace of the Dead, which is side content, I guess, for lack of a better term that you can do with one to four players.

165
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:52,400
But specifically, they are doing floors 171 to 180. These floors are actually harder than the floors that come after it. There's 200 floors, the whole thing, these are the hardest 10, you get through these, you're going to get through the rest of it. They're going to speed run solo machinist Palace Palace of the Dead 171 to 180. And it takes about an hour to go through. I'm not sure how long a speedrunner will take, maybe also an hour. But I think that's going to be very interesting. And I like the fact that they're going to spotlight a side mode in the game.

166
00:25:52,440 --> 00:26:22,280
Essentially. So it's going to be very cool to see. So Bobby says the estimate is one hour. So yeah, that sounds about right. So very excited. Bobby also says no mouse keyboard only. I could, I could see how somebody is probably doing that, to be honest, like it is it harder? Yes. Is it impossible? No, it's not the same as like playing it blindfolded or something. But I mean, still kudos, just the fact they're going to get through that with a big audience watching. I don't want to undersell what this person is

167
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:52,200
doing. They're taking on a very big task, where a lot can go wrong, because there's a lot of randomly generated elements in that. So there's, you know, they're taking on a big thing. So I'm very excited to see it. Alright, let's talk about the things we took on this week in our gaming week. And we're going to talk a little bit about our gaming weeks. So Dark Soccer, usually I'd start with you and how was your gaming week, but I think you had some kind of like personal things about like what you're doing with your stream coming up and so forth you wanted to get into. Can you can you talk us

168
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,880
through some of that?

169
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:15,720
Yeah, there's a few things going on. So first and foremost, and I sent you a graphic for it. But I'm gonna start at the beginning, my mom went into the ER, I think I might have mentioned it last week. And they did a couple of cultures. She does have thrush as well as

170
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:45,540
multifocal pneumonia, meaning she's got different pockets of pneumonia in her lung, and her lungs are raw. But on top of that, they have to retest her for COVID because the culture that they that they took came back viral. So she is still in the hospital. And now the thing is, is that my mom lives on Social Security and a part time job. She has no insurance, she lives in Alabama. So you can

171
00:27:45,540 --> 00:28:14,700
imagine how hard it's going to be for her after having just bought a house to make ends meet with the with a hospital bill like that. So I am, I've created a GoFundMe. And the link is on my Twitter at dark sakura. It's, I think it's my pinned post. But on top of that, on top of that, I'm running a momathon on

172
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:34,020
November 1, I'm going to be doing a 12 hour Dead by Daylight plus whatever stream, if I get tired of Debbie, although I still like to, you know, say that I can endure a full 12 hours of Dead by Daylight. But there's gonna be like some chatting and like watching some YouTube stuff,

173
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:57,140
we'll throw in some fun things. But I am going to be doing artwork as the grand prize for whoever donates the most individually, as well as offering up mini portraits. And I'll go outside of like Dead by Daylight, if you want like a portrait of like a character from the show or, or something, I'll figure it out.

174
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,180
And you did the pig artwork on your on the banner, right? Just to get a sense of what people

175
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,380
Oh, no, I didn't do that pig.

176
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,660
Oh, I thought you did. I'm sorry.

177
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,780
No, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I did this pig.

178
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:20,180
And for those Okay, so I'm sorry for those on the podcast feed. There's no way for me to explain a photo to you. But you can go to dark soccer's Twitter account at dark soccer, and I'm sure it's in her media tab somewhere.

179
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:27,140
Yeah, that that's actually official behavior artwork. So don't sue me behavior. I gotta pay for my mom.

180
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:49,820
I think they won't care. But yeah, they're big. But you have I do know I saw your artwork. Well, I saw it in person. But I also saw it on losing color stream who you know, if you don't know who that is, they are a very prolific Dead by Daylight streamer. They're very good at killer, specifically the nurse. And so you know, they're a twitch partner, and they they put that photograph, I think or sorry, I keep saying photograph, but like in the print, they put it

181
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,780
behind them on their stream. So you actually see that nurse. And that was you that did that. So it was pretty cool.

182
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:19,380
Yeah. And it was funny, like, a couple of times now when I've popped in to chat, like, I'll do like a raid every so often, you know, I tried to, to focus on smaller people, but I will also focus on my friends. And so I did a raid and and they're like, look at look at here's the picture again. And you know how that came about? He was on stream one day saying, Oh, what, you know, because he stopped using a green

183
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:47,700
screen and started like actually decorating the room. And they're saying, Oh, I would like I'd love to have some framed artwork. And I'm like, Wait a second, because I was looking for an excuse to get back into some of my drawing. I've got all those Copics over there. And I have and I had a frame. I actually had a frame to pack that I haven't used. This is like, why not? I'll make it a gift for one of my friends.

184
00:30:48,700 --> 00:31:14,580
And I'm glad that I'm glad so glad he likes it so much. But yeah, I'll be doing something like that. A like a 12 by nine thing done in a Copic markers of whichever killer or survivor in your choice of cosmetic. Or, you know, if you're not a Debbie person, then talk to me, we'll, we'll, we'll figure something else out.

185
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:44,020
But I'm doing some many, many portraits as well as, as a gift, you know, not as a gift, but as a as a reward. And, you know, I'll change some stuff up. It doesn't have to be a shade of dead by daylight. But, but yeah, I am I'm definitely by the way, yeah, Copics are expensive, like they are super expensive.

186
00:31:44,580 --> 00:32:14,540
And I have found very good deals on Copic markers. So that's how I've amassed my collection. But at any rate, I am doing a momathon at noon on November 1, to help raise money for my mother's medical bills. In other news, going back on the medical front. I'm sure all of y'all know my bestie, Finara. She was my college roommate.

187
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:41,100
I've known her for longer than some of you have been alive. She was the first person who came out to visit me when I moved to California. And yeah, you know, and she's she's been on hard times, but she and I have her permission to say so. So that's what I'm going into it. A few days ago, she was admitted to ICU because she she had been complaining of problems breathing.

188
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:54,740
And like she was going to come play, you know, dead by daylight with me and it would take her like a solid like 15 minutes to get from upstairs to her computer. And I was like, you sure you're okay. You don't have to play if you're feeling so crappy.

189
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:24,740
But it turned out she went in for a clot. It was either a heart or lung is what the immediate thought it was because, you know, heart issues can also cause respiratory distress. It turned out there was a like a clot near her heart. And so they, they they did a catheter, they got it out. She she finally told me she's able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, take care of her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know, lighten up her heart, you know, and she was able to, you know

190
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:54,740
do a few normal things. Now they moved her out of ICU. She is in a regular room. She's doing better. The hospital apparently lost the charger that I spent 50 bucks sending to her because she needed a phone charger.

191
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:00,020
Being released in the next couple of days. So, and again, for those that don't know the name,

192
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:04,660
like oftentimes, you know, when when we're live here at OLR, we're rating you after the show, and

193
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,700
you're playing Dead by Daylight, and she's usually there with you also playing. Yeah, I can't really

194
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:15,540
play because I have to go edit the show and get that posted. But you know, she's kind of been your

195
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,660
sidekick in a lot of those adventures. So well, she started off as my meat shield. When I started

196
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:26,340
playing Survivor, and then, and now she's my accountant, because she keeps tracks of all of the

197
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,900
challenges that that I've done. She watches her own. She's like, I'll watch yours too. Why not?

198
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,380
She also used to like track my inventory in Animal Crossing. She just, she loves spreadsheets. Fair

199
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:47,060
enough. But I mean, I've, we played D&D together back in the day. We watched, we would watch

200
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:59,540
anime, like at home, but on like AOL chat, you know. And we, she, she ran my AOL, AOL Facebook

201
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:05,780
Animal Crossing group. Oh, yeah, I think still keeps up with it. And so I would just like for

202
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:16,260
everyone to send Gwen Finara some positive thoughts or whatever you do. You know, she's

203
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,700
got good doctors. She's getting better. She'll be going home before too long. But I wanted to bring

204
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:27,460
that up because she has also been a long time supporter of the show. She's been a long time

205
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:35,140
supporter of me and is one of my best friends in the world. I was really, really worried.

206
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:40,020
Well, definitely sending, you know, healing vibes and our thoughts, you know, for a quick turnaround.

207
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,020
I'm glad she's where she needs to be with the hospital and getting the care she needs and,

208
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:51,700
you know, hoping for a quick speedy recovery. Yeah, but, and I appreciate it. And I'll probably

209
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:59,860
say more on my deal. But back to my mom, Momathon, November 1st, starting at noon Pacific time,

210
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:06,020
going to midnight should be time for anyone to come in. And if you want to play with me,

211
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,540
my queue is open. I'm always looking for friends. I've reached out to a few people already who said

212
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:20,740
that they would play with me. So some kind of big names. Anything else in your gaming week?

213
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:28,820
Sorry, should pivot over there. I know, Dead by Daylight, Cult of the Lamb, Final Fantasy V. I'm

214
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:35,140
still playing that. I'm pretty, I'm enjoying it. It's been so long since I beat it that

215
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,140
it's kind of like being reintroduced to the game again.

216
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,700
Like, it's almost like the first time. It's pretty, pretty fun. And, you know,

217
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,100
I've been playing my wordscapes. Oh, I had another encounter, speaking of games.

218
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,380
And that's with Boosteroid. Because, you know, I've been working, I've been using Boosteroid

219
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:04,820
as my replacement for Stadia so I can play Dead by Daylight through Steam. And I had

220
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:11,300
this thing going on. When I play in Safari and I pull it up, it doesn't go full screen.

221
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:17,540
It keeps my window the way I had it. When I do it in Chrome, it forces it into full screen,

222
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:23,060
which makes it really difficult for me to like watch my chat at the same time as playing the

223
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:29,780
game, you know? I mean, unless I want to bust out my iPad, but I do other things, right? So

224
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:39,540
I can use Safari. It's just that it'd be easier for me to do my window capture on a different

225
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:48,900
window, you know? So I was working actually with one of their representatives. Actually, I just,

226
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,460
you know, put out a question to them anyway to get this from going full screen and actually had

227
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:59,940
a long chat with one of their representatives. I was actually a person that is, I think,

228
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,700
running their Twitter. And we went over everything and basically it's not possible,

229
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,740
but they stuck with me and had other suggestions and other ways to try to trick it into going.

230
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:19,780
And just that sort of support, like personal support like that. And they were so nice about it

231
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:24,580
that, you know, and I sent a screen recording and everything and they're like, oh,

232
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,660
we like screen recordings. And I also found out that they may be coming out with a Mac version

233
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:37,860
of their software, like because they've got a Windows download client and they were

234
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:45,300
saying that a Mac client is in production. Yeah. So I got permission to give that little tidbit

235
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:51,860
out. So yeah. But the experience was great. And I'd say if anyone's looking for an alternative to

236
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:59,300
something like GeForce Now, definitely look at Boostroid. Their service is like, we didn't get

237
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:06,340
the problem solved, but they stuck with me to try. And that is almost as, yeah, that's almost as much

238
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:12,900
as getting it done. And that's it. All right. Well, Loki, I know we joked earlier it was pretty

239
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,740
much Minecraft, but any new, any new videos to talk about or anything in your gaming week?

240
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:24,180
No, I'm still working on the next one. So designing stuff for it. It's probably gonna be

241
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,620
multiple farms. I'm hoping to be able to start introducing the robot masters into it. I just got

242
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:36,420
one of the new one, one of the new ones. They're finishing up the design on stuff. So hopefully

243
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:42,500
they'll be coming soon. I'm having multiples of that design done because both of them came out

244
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:50,740
really good. So hopefully get shirts or something. And then I didn't really have much else. I did

245
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:57,540
want to mention, though, I watched a charity stream today. So one of the largest SMPs out

246
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:03,780
there for Minecraft, Hermitcraft, probably, you know, the most popular S&P that's out there,

247
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:09,940
have been going for like 10 years or so. They just did their first ever charity livestream for

248
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:19,540
Gamers Outreach, as was headed up by Good Times with Scar, and they raised over $423,000 for them.

249
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:29,380
And basically Gamers Outreach is a charity that brings those like mobile gaming, not really kiosks,

250
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:37,700
they're kind of like, it's like a monitor and, and the gaming console kind of on a rollable cart

251
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:43,380
that they can have in hospitals for kids that are sick. And since Good Times with Scar, he's got a

252
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:48,740
lot of health issues. He's always in the hospital for different things. You know, they're hoping

253
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,940
with that, the money that they have raised, at least that'll be another hundred or so units that

254
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,260
they'll be able to put into different hospitals and stuff. So I thought that was really cool.

255
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,940
So yeah, it's cool. Yep. All right. That's all I had. Awesome. Let me tell you about my gaming

256
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,180
week. Unfortunately, the game I've been playing the most this week, I'm not allowed to talk to

257
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:14,580
you guys about I really wish I could tell you what I've been putting in the hours for. But the devil

258
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,700
will get me if I tell you. All I can say is that if I could talk about it, I would have a lot of

259
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,020
nice things to say about it and where it's at in its current state. So but that's that's all I can

260
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:31,380
say right now. So otherwise, the games I can talk about I'm laughing because bonds 006 in chat is

261
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:40,660
saying Rob's trash talking and Overwatch two is a hoot. And yeah, I did I did play some Overwatch

262
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:46,260
two on a stream a little bit. And I was trash talking a little bit but mostly myself because

263
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,980
I'm really bad at it. But it was it was it's fun to learn. And you know what, you got to start

264
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,780
somewhere. And yeah, so I've been I've been having more fun with that series and I haven't a long

265
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:02,420
time I think the the little reboot was very, very good for it. Let's see what else have I

266
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,940
been playing? I still play no man's sky even though the drop campaign is done. I actually

267
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,980
played a little bit off stream last night and I might stream it again tomorrow. I don't know I

268
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,580
haven't decided what games I'm going to stream next week. So I might do another no man's sky

269
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:19,380
stream just because I'm having fun with the casual mode in it like the relaxed mode is is really fun

270
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,580
and it just kind of like you get to play the game without those immediate pressures of having to

271
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:30,820
like do certain things and grind a lot for them. So that that's great. I want to keep playing that

272
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:36,500
and continuing in Final Fantasy 14, which did have a minor content patch this week, they added a new

273
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,060
thing called variant dungeons in it. There's lots of criterion dungeons, but I haven't gotten to do

274
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:45,380
those yet. But the variant dungeon was very interesting. So it's like basically a dungeon

275
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:50,580
that's very large. And there are 12 different ways to complete the dungeon. But it's up to you and

276
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,980
your party how you want to do it. But you can also run it by yourself if you want to just do it

277
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,620
through with one person you can. So I thought that was a neat little side thing to add to it and

278
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:05,380
certainly is a little more interesting than just running the same two experts over and over again

279
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:10,820
in roulette. I kind of wish they would fuse the ideas and just have these expert dungeons be very

280
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,740
large and have different paths like but maybe that's where things are going. I don't know. But I

281
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:20,100
appreciate having the more diverse content in the game. I still I'm still working on my island. I'm

282
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,860
almost done getting all the cosmetics on my island. But I'm really excited that there should

283
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,820
be more with the island sanctuary stuff coming soon as well. So yeah, been keeping busy a lot

284
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:35,380
with my gaming week. Very excited. So chocobo crossing. chocobo crossing. Yeah, a little bit.

285
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:40,820
I don't really. I don't really see it as animal crossing as much. I think that's a but farm sim

286
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,620
that whole thing very much that I mean, as much as they can do in an existing MMO, but it's I,

287
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,820
I love it. And the cosmetic rewards I got were pretty cool. Like the mounts are really cute. So

288
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:57,300
now they just put in a new beast tribe daily thing though. And I need to do those mounts as well. So

289
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:02,020
yeah, just lots of great stuff going on in Final Fantasy 14. I know there was a joke at the start

290
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:08,180
of the show. It's the little bumps we play when we're live. We don't usually play them on the

291
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:13,460
podcast feed. But tonight was a joke about the Prime Minister of Britain and how you know she

292
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:18,180
quit after six weeks. And it was video games that we've played longer than she was Prime Minister.

293
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:23,220
And I actually put to do it I put it I was like I know I've spent like in the last 10 years that

294
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,860
this game has existed. I've absolutely racked up more than like what would six weeks be in hours

295
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:33,780
to be something like 120 hours. Like I have easily put in more than six weeks. No God, that's only

296
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:42,180
six of these more like 700 1000 hours probably. But anyway, I did my playtime 151 days I've spent

297
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,900
in Final Fantasy 14 151 days of game time. That's a that's a lot. That's a lot. That's a lot.

298
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:57,140
So anyway. All right. Let's move on. That's it for our gaming weeks. Let's talk about some other

299
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:02,020
things that are going on in the news. We'll start with Loki Oh, dark Tetsuya says she was Prime

300
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,860
Minister for 1008 hours. That's dark soccer. How many hours do you have in dead by daylight?

301
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,020
You're muted on Discord. I see the icon.

302
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,420
Less than that. Less than that. Oh, I thought maybe actually, yeah, I haven't. I don't know

303
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,340
that I've hit that. I mean, I can find out. I thought you'd hit the 1000 hours maybe. But

304
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,740
that's funny. I actually should probably check. So if there's a video game out there,

305
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,980
you've played for more than 1000 and eight hours. Congrats. You played a video game longer than she

306
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,500
was Prime Minister. So all right. Moving on. Let's get into some gaming news for the week.

307
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:42,020
So Microsoft is reportedly laid off hundreds of employees from its workforce across several

308
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:51,140
different divisions. There were, of course, some some of the subsidiaries as well, including

309
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:59,940
studio alpha, the Xbox division, the Business Insider article suggests it's less than 1000.

310
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:05,700
Business Insider article suggests it's less than 1000, but it is still several hundred.

311
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:11,780
In the course, Microsoft spokesperson has said that like all companies, we evaluate our business

312
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:16,740
priorities on a regular basis and make structural adjustments accordingly. We will continue to

313
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:24,260
invest in the I don't even care. It's just corporate speak. No idea why. I mean,

314
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:32,740
I don't know, restructuring, I guess. But it does suck to see people out of work.

315
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:38,020
Yeah, this is always a bummer of stuff to report on. I mean, it was the entire organization.

316
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:43,140
Remember, Microsoft does a lot of things, right? Windows, heck, HoloLens and things like that,

317
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,220
that never really got, you know, the retail thing, even though, you know, they're still using it for

318
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:53,140
other things. But, you know, so these layoffs could come from other parts of the organization,

319
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:58,900
not just, you know, Xbox, but it does sound like we do know that some Xbox was impacted.

320
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,860
But do we know if that's a dozen people? Do we know if that's 100 people? We don't totally know.

321
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,260
Bobby Black over chat says they probably reprioritize for the next financial year

322
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,620
and scale their workforce accordingly. Yes. And honestly, like,

323
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,660
maybe there it's part planning for the Activision Blizzard merger, probably not this soon out,

324
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,340
to be honest, but let's be honest, because it's not like, yeah, it's not guaranteed.

325
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,460
It's still going to get tied up in courts. But if that merger goes through, there's absolutely

326
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,860
going to be redundancies and it's, you know, it's not going to be fun to report on, but that's just

327
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,500
what's going to happen. You know, but that could be things like legal and, you know, it may not be

328
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,620
necessarily, you know, development. Yeah. I mean, we can't have two Bobby Kotex. I mean,

329
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,540
someone's got to go. Well, I can tell you who needs to go in that situation. But anyway,

330
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:50,500
um, yeah. So, you know, Microsoft, um, I don't know if I would take this aside of anything.

331
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,780
I think people are reading into this, like, you know, you know, there's the people on Twitter

332
00:47:53,780 --> 00:48:01,060
that are like, Oh, Xbox flop confirmed. And it's like, put the car in a lower gear. Let's

333
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,860
critically think something we forget to do on social media. Sometimes does this necessarily

334
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,980
mean the end is coming? No, this could just be, you know, the result of other things shifting

335
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:17,140
around and doom and gloom. Yeah. Doom and gloom. The doom and gloom is when a bunch of games start

336
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:22,340
getting canceled out of Microsoft. Yeah. Yeah. Let's put it this way. It could have been worse.

337
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:26,580
They could have waited another month or so. And then the articles will be saying, and they did

338
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:32,820
it right before Christmas. What are these people going to like? So, yeah. Well still, I hope those

339
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:36,900
that were affected can find work, you know, maybe just Microsoft, such a huge company. Sometimes

340
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,740
with these things, they apply for a job somewhere else in the company and are able to keep their

341
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:45,860
time in. So hopefully, there's a lot of that whole thing going on. We'll see. Or plan a

342
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:51,140
different company and eventually become Microsoft because you get bought. All right. Speaking of the

343
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,860
lack of ability to critically think, you know, I've got to talk about this. I actually believe

344
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,140
it or not. I don't want to talk about this because I feel like I've talked about it enough on social

345
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:05,620
media this week. However, it's important to talk about the other half of this story that we only

346
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:11,460
knew half of last week. And that is, yes, the bayonet of three. Voice actress, Helena Taylor,

347
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,540
and everything that she brought up to the internet and how the internet rallied around her.

348
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,100
What did I say on last week's show? I said, I'm going to take an unpopular opinion here.

349
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:25,620
I meant, you know what? I've been blocked on social media. I've been unfollowed on social media

350
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:30,020
because I dared to take an unpopular opinion against the mob. Then you know what? I even went

351
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:34,020
so far last week is to say, what did I say last week? I'll give you an exact quote of what I said.

352
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:39,540
Helena Taylor is lying by omission. Guess what news came out this week?

353
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,820
Helena Taylor, omitted some things in her story.

354
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:53,140
Now look, I'm not always right. I'm not, and I'll be the first, I like to be a humble person,

355
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:58,260
but like on this one, I knew it didn't add up. And there's a lot of you out there, to be fair,

356
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,020
this isn't just me. There's a lot of you out there that knew it didn't add up, but we talked

357
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:08,100
about it on the show. Jamie said something in that video. Something in that video struck me

358
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:15,060
as off, right? And that's what it is. So as it turns out, according to journalistic reports,

359
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,860
Helena Taylor omitted some things, which would be lying by omission.

360
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:27,300
What happened? So Bloomberg did a report and Bloomberg learned through several different

361
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,620
sources than platinum, two different sources than platinum, and some actual documents that they

362
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,980
can't share because of confidentiality reasons, that Helena Taylor was actually offered three

363
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:42,660
to four K per session for five, four hour sessions. So her actual paycheck that she

364
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,700
was offered was somewhere between 15 to 20,000 to reprise the role of Bayonetta.

365
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:54,020
In response to this, Helena Taylor said, I want a six figure sum and residuals for the game.

366
00:50:54,580 --> 00:51:01,060
Now look, I'm not here to argue and say she didn't deserve that. I understand that voice

367
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:07,620
actors and actresses are probably underpaid in this. To be fair, a lot of the people that

368
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:12,980
develop the games are also underpaid. And we know it is the executives, the Bobby Kotick's of the

369
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:20,740
world that are grossly overpaid. So there is some balancing that needs to be done in the industry.

370
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:26,420
You know, was the part of Bayonetta when you consider that that series does not break through

371
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:32,180
for Nintendo in the way it's an Animal Crossing or a Mario, you know, Bayonetta is kind of,

372
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:37,540
you know, it's it's making money, but it's not making oodles and oodles of money, right? So could

373
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:42,340
she was she worth six figures in that particular scenario? No, that's that's an argument for

374
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:48,420
another time. Charles Martinet doesn't even get six figure salary. So what makes her think that

375
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,980
she's gonna get that? So she's allowed to ask for what she thinks she's worth. They told her no.

376
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:57,060
Here's the other thing. But they still they still wanted to have her in the game.

377
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,540
And they said, you know what, so they started to look for someone to replace her.

378
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:07,300
They hired Jennifer Hale, they offered Helena Taylor a cameo in the game, which if you go back

379
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:13,060
to last week's show about the story spoilers, apparently in the game, start to add up a lot

380
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:19,620
like why would she only get a ah, maybe there's some fire and smoke and fire to those story

381
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,540
spoiler scenarios, but I will I won't re recap those because I know not everybody maybe wants

382
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,780
to hear those even though clearly it's something that happens in the opening segments of the game.

383
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:36,180
It's not a thing for the end. So they offered Helena Taylor to do one session, a cameo in the

384
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:42,580
game. And she also turned that down. So at the end of the day, did they offer her $4,000 to do

385
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:50,660
voice acting for Bayonetta? Yes. Did she omit the other offer they gave her? Yes. And did she do

386
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,300
damage to not just her cause, but all the voice actors and actresses out there fighting for more

387
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:01,380
money the way she put this whole thing together? I think she did. And it sucks. Now, of course,

388
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:08,900
Dark Soccer, you said this last week, and boy, oh boy, is this true. Sometimes when people feel

389
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:14,340
a certain way, even when they don't have all the facts, they dig their heels in. They can't

390
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,860
possibly have been wrong about this. And sure enough, there's so many people out there that are

391
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:25,540
saying, well, Bloomberg didn't produce the receipts. Bloomberg didn't show us, Bloomberg

392
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:32,660
needs to show us the letters. No, they don't. No, they don't. That's the journalistic- They don't

393
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:38,820
owe us an explanation at all. In fact, actually, internet people, something you need to learn about

394
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:45,460
life, nobody owes you shit. You need to learn that lesson real quick, or you're going to be

395
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:51,140
very disappointed as you walk through this life. Nobody owes you shit, especially- And also,

396
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,980
not everything is about you. That's right. You need to stop digging your heels in,

397
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:02,340
because here's the- And this is what I will absolutely watch people do. They will cherry pick

398
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,980
what Bloomberg articles, because Jason Schreier, sorry if I'm mispronouncing his name,

399
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,140
he has a pretty good track record about getting these insider stories. He obviously has very good

400
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,820
relations with people that are in the industry, and he's worked hard to get some of these inside

401
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:19,460
sources. You are not allowed to cherry pick which Bloomberg stories you will pick at face value

402
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:25,380
and which one you will not. Also, in addition to this, other journalists, there was at least one

403
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:30,100
other journalist working for another video game site who was independently also doing this,

404
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:35,300
who said, I can independently confirm what Jason is reporting on. He beat me to it.

405
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:43,220
So, I'm sorry. No, you don't get to see the receipts. You take the word as you took her

406
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:47,780
word, or you just- You need to admit you're digging your heels in too much on this.

407
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:57,620
Steven Toledo confirmed it too. So, multiple people are confirming there was more to this

408
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:08,660
story than she is leading on, period. You were emotionally manipulated by this woman.

409
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:15,860
And I've been emotionally manipulated by content on the internet quite often,

410
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:21,780
and I need to recognize when that's happening to me. So, I think there's a lot of people,

411
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,100
and to be fair, I would say there's a lot of people that when this news came out from

412
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:32,580
Bloomberg, they said, oh shit, lesson learned. I probably should have waited to hear the whole

413
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:38,900
story before. Okay, cool. I can admit when I'm wrong too. Let's learn together. Let's do better

414
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:47,060
next time. But those of you that are still digging your heels in on this, wake up. Bobby says she

415
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,820
doesn't ever want to do voice acting again anyway. She wants to go back to the theater and not talk

416
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:55,300
about this anymore. Yes, that was her response to Bloomberg. Because she got called the fuck out.

417
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:01,300
She also like destroyed her reputation too. She threw voice actors under the bus because

418
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:06,020
voice acting isn't her bread and butter. That's what Gigi Ramos said. I want to read this thread

419
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:12,820
on Twitter because honestly, this journalist on Twitter, her name is Catherine Cross and her

420
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:16,900
Twitter name is Quine Moon. I hope I said that right. I'm sorry if I didn't. I've heard Catherine

421
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,300
Cross before. I know she's a pretty prolific games journalist. She wrote an article that I think is

422
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:29,460
great. And you can see this over at wire.com. And I think she summed this up 100%. I retweeted this

423
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,220
on my account over at Mr. Rob Roberts. And I apologize to Catherine because I am going to read

424
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:38,500
this word for word. But I'm giving full credit to Catherine on this because she hit the nail on the

425
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,020
head and I think everybody needs to hear it. And I'm noticing this thing has only been retweeted

426
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:50,340
17 times. That is not enough. So if I may, in the words of Catherine Cross, Quine Moon over on

427
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,980
Twitter, I wrote about the unfortunate Helena Taylor affair and how it exposes the risks of

428
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:00,660
social media's demand for immediacy. A worthy cause was damaged, a veteran voice actor harassed,

429
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:05,620
all because people were emotionally manipulated into retweeting before thinking. The fragility

430
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:10,260
of personality driven politics is nowhere more apparent than on social media. And the risk of

431
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:14,820
depending on one's person's sympathetic story to drive a campaign is that if they turn out to have

432
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:20,580
acted in bad faith, the entire campaign can collapse. Social media demands urgency from us,

433
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:24,340
share now, think later. It's bitten well-meaning people in the ass many times before and it'll do

434
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:31,460
so again. And the really aggravating thing in this case is that Taylor's misleading claims

435
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:38,580
prevented us from talking about the fact that the true figure, some $15,000, is still far less than

436
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:43,700
one would expect for the voice actor or actress of a title character of a major franchise.

437
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:51,540
Can we talk about that part for a minute? Absolutely. Yes. Both of those things can be true.

438
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:57,380
Helena Taylor could not have been, may not have been paid enough money for what she

439
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:02,980
brought to that franchise. And she did a really shitty thing in the way she brought that up to

440
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:09,300
the rest of the internet. Continuing on the thread from Catherine Cross, just two tweets left,

441
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:14,660
bear with me here, but it's important. But it's always hard to pivot from a hot and heavy

442
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:20,180
personality-focused campaign to one focused only on the structural issues. You can't just go,

443
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:27,140
well, nevertheless, you lose momentum, supporters, time, and the headlines. Taylor was supposed to be

444
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:33,940
I'm sorry, I don't know this word, synodoch for the wider struggles of voice actors.

445
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:40,180
Had she told the truth, not made her campaign needlessly personal, for example,

446
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:46,020
telling Hale she had no right to sign Bayonetta merch, not demanded a boycott, the focus could

447
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:53,300
have been on the issues. Oh my God, so much that part. Snaps and kudos to Catherine for that thread.

448
00:58:54,180 --> 00:59:01,060
I read it because everybody needs to hear it. There was a cause in here worth fighting for.

449
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:07,540
She did more damage to it because she was threatened by being replaced. And now when

450
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:13,540
you see this whole thing coming together, now when you realize she was offered money,

451
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:18,900
she said, no, they went and got somebody else and offered her a cameo in good faith still,

452
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:25,140
she realized what was happening. She was easily replaced by somebody else.

453
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:28,180
And this could threaten because she doesn't, go ahead.

454
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,580
Possibly somebody better.

455
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:37,620
And possibly that, but also, yes, somebody with certainly a deeper resume and somebody that gets

456
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:44,660
invited to more conventions than she historically has been. She saw that she may not have a place

457
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:50,500
and she was threatened by that, but that does not give her the right to manipulate people into

458
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:58,900
boycotting a game that so many people worked on. Why didn't she go to Jennifer privately and say,

459
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:04,900
why did you do this? Why did this happen? Can we talk about how to make this better for the

460
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:11,460
other people in our industry privately? Because Jennifer's fought that fight since 2016,

461
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:18,740
if not sooner. There were so many ways she could have done this, not on Twitter, but she did the

462
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:31,460
crappy thing and it sucks. But here's the thing, how can you personally help this cause? And I

463
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:37,300
would like to offer a suggestion because remember, Ms. Hale and so many other voice actors and

464
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:42,020
actresses out there, they go around to conventions and I've gone to my share of gaming conventions

465
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,540
and I do conventions in other circuits as well. I've talked about horror hosting and I've been,

466
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:50,180
we just had a horror convention this weekend and so forth. I can't tell you how often I overhear

467
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:57,940
at some of these conventions. Why does it cost $50 to get a selfie with this person? Do they

468
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:06,580
really think they're worth that much? They got paid what they're worth.

469
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:13,300
How dare you utter that phrase and then go on the internet and complain that voice actors are

470
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:21,060
not paid enough. I'm not saying you have to buy the selfie and you have to buy the autograph.

471
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:28,820
You choose what you do and you don't want to get, that's fine. But how dare you bitch about a person

472
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:36,260
asking what they believe they're worth when you're going to go online and fight for that,

473
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:40,980
but you're not willing to do it in person when it's your own wallet. I just need everybody to

474
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:49,300
consider that for a minute. That's all. And with that being said, I would like to talk about,

475
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,620
well, I would like to talk about the struggle of voice actors and voice actresses again.

476
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:58,580
I would like to revisit this issue, but as far as Helena Taylor is concerned,

477
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:04,580
she's clearly burned her bridge. She's fine with that. She's not going to work in this industry

478
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:09,700
again, at least not on a AAA game, maybe an indie game, but she's not going to work in this industry

479
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:14,020
again. She seems very much fine with that. I wish her the best of luck with theater. I hope she

480
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:18,260
learns something from this whole thing. If she doesn't get a part or something in it, don't

481
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:26,100
boycott the whole production, ma'am. Honestly, this is probably going to bite her in the ass

482
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:34,100
in the theater world as well. It just might. Those universes are related. Yeah, no, you're

483
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:39,140
very correct. You're very correct on that. Well, considering this is all over social media and

484
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:42,980
stuff, people are going to hear about it. It's not like it's within the industry. What did you

485
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:50,980
think was going to happen? All right, let's move on. I'm ready for another topic. I really have

486
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:56,020
so many more rants in me than talking about Bayonetta. All right, let's go on to talking

487
01:02:56,020 --> 01:03:05,860
about The Sims, Loki. You mean me? I'm sorry. Yeah. At any rate, yeah, it's about The Sims.

488
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:14,260
Sims Summit just happened. Basically, it's a structured version of their monthly stream,

489
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:20,740
so they did sneak peeks, announcements, updates for the Sim community, and then there is some

490
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:31,380
big stuff going on in the world. They have a partnership with Overwolf, which will have

491
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:38,020
a destination for in-game creators to upload, host, and share their mods, custom content,

492
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:42,580
and all that's curated. It's under trial. More information will come out this year.

493
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:53,860
Also, Sims 5 has been teased, and that's actually going to include, so they say, multiplayer.

494
01:03:54,580 --> 01:04:02,580
It's called Project Rene, as in Renaissance, because they want this to be a renewal or

495
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:08,660
rebirth of the series. It will have the ability to play solo or with others, and it will build

496
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:13,700
on the current foundations. They're showing the build tools, not just custom colors anymore,

497
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:19,380
but different patterns, and changing the shape of furniture, free placement of pillows,

498
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:26,020
free placement of items, and then playing with other people whenever you want to,

499
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:31,940
and an identical version of it that plays on mobile. They were even showing that you can

500
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:38,100
do your modifications on mobile and insert them into your game on your computer.

501
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:50,580
Also, though, for Sims 4, they are doing an update to babies and toddlers in 2023.

502
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:52,820
Oh, hooray.

503
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:55,940
Well, a lot of people are into The Sims.

504
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,180
Yeah, no, no. I'm talking about the babies and toddlers, specifically. But no, I mean,

505
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:05,780
you used to love The Sims. You kind of, I don't want to say fell off the wagon,

506
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:08,020
but your interest went elsewhere.

507
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,540
You know how much it would be to buy the entirety of Sims 4?

508
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,620
Oh, God. Well, the base game's free now, but that ain't enough. Like,

509
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:20,660
all the stuff they've come out with after that, probably thousands of dollars at this point.

510
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:29,220
Yeah, so if you buy, and this is actually as of, like, someone posted this two years ago.

511
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:36,580
The cost without the base game is just DLC up to two years ago with $789.59.

512
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,700
Yeah, I think it's more than that now.

513
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,820
Yeah, right. That's why I'm specifying two years ago.

514
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:48,500
You know, it's disgusting. And I'm kind of tired of it.

515
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,300
I've started playing Sims 4 again, just with the stuff that I have.

516
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:59,140
But I downloaded it. I'll put it that way. I just installed my mods and then I was like,

517
01:05:59,140 --> 01:05:59,780
I don't want to play.

518
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,580
Well, let's talk about mods, shall we? I think Loki has a companion piece to this.

519
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:12,740
Yeah, so another thing that was announced during that whole Sims Hub thing or Sims Summit

520
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:20,020
is that they're going to be adding a, like, I guess, a central resource for mods as well,

521
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:26,500
kind of a more curated type of thing. They're going to only have certain vited mod makers to

522
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:34,500
be there. They're calling it the mod squad. And I guess it's supposed to be a safer,

523
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,180
more centralized way to download stuff, even though they do have the Sims resource.

524
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:43,060
But because that's just a Sims resource is a subscription service,

525
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,740
although it's not an expensive one.

526
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:52,180
Yeah, so they're now going to have this mod squad thing to allow people to upload

527
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:57,780
their modifications and stuff. I don't see how that's necessarily going to make it better.

528
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,460
Well, if you're worried about your child downloading nudie and sex mods for Sims,

529
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,820
the mod squad to the rescue to curate everything and make sure the

530
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,340
super adult stuff doesn't get in there.

531
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,780
Yeah, I guess that's good at least.

532
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:14,820
That's kind of what it is to me. But I guess there's also a part where, like, you know,

533
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:19,380
I kind of look at, like, what Bethesda did with, like, Skyrim and even the Doom games.

534
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:23,540
Like, they've been kind of embracing official mods, but it's, it's extremely limited,

535
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:27,060
but at least it gives people kind of like a taste of that some of the most popular stuff.

536
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:30,340
That's kind of what I kind of heard in this. Yeah, yeah.

537
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,980
Yeah, I'm probably still going to keep using the Sims resource because I

538
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,660
their stuff doesn't have anything attached to it.

539
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:43,620
Yeah. I mean, despite what they say, you can disable all cookies. And if you're

540
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:48,180
like, like me on a Mac Safari will remove the majority of that for you.

541
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:54,180
So and, and you get a wider range, like they're saying, Oh, we're picking and

542
01:07:54,180 --> 01:08:01,140
choosing who we invite to this program. But I, and I can tell the avatars that

543
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:05,140
they used in their little video, those were body mods, absolute body mods.

544
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:15,060
But I don't like the way some stuff looks. And I have a feeling they would want to keep with

545
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:21,380
their branded look for Sims. Because the faces on there were total like Maxis faces.

546
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:28,580
But I get my mod so that they don't look like Sims, if that makes sense.

547
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:32,820
I can play Sims, but they don't look freaking weird.

548
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:40,500
All right. Well, I want to bring up another story here, going to another fourth game in a popular

549
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:45,460
series. And let's talk about the Resident Evil four remake, shall we? We talked about Silent

550
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:51,140
Hill earlier, but there was also a Resident Evil stream this week, Capcom did a Resident Evil four

551
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:55,940
remake stream, and confirmed the game is not just coming to PS5, even though Sony showed it off

552
01:08:55,940 --> 01:09:01,300
first, it will be coming out for Xbox series S and X, it will also come out for PlayStation four.

553
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,220
And if you get the PlayStation four version, you could upgrade to PS5 for free. So that that's

554
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:09,780
pretty cool. So there's some new gameplay footage that came out as well. And we're playing some of

555
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:14,500
that live on our show. For those that are on the podcast feed, you can find this trailer anywhere,

556
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:20,420
you can see where the you know, it's all over YouTube. And it does, it does look really nice,

557
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:25,700
I gotta say, especially considering how what a big game Resident Evil four is in the franchise,

558
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:29,700
there's a lot of pressure for this game to be not just a good remake, like two and three,

559
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:34,900
but to really deliver on what people loved about four. So again, there was more screenshots,

560
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:38,340
there's also some special editions that they announced will be coming as well. I mean,

561
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:42,500
why not? A deluxe edition and a collector's edition all releasing when this comes out on

562
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:47,940
March 24 2023. The deluxe edition will have additional in game content, costume weapons,

563
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:54,260
a treasure map, the physical box only collector's edition also have physical map, art book,

564
01:09:54,260 --> 01:10:00,020
a Leon figure, why not? And much more. So there's, you know, a lot of things that are in this.

565
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,340
So it's going to be what's your face less annoying?

566
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:07,620
Uh, who knows? Uh, well, Ada Wong still be fierce as hell, I'm sure.

567
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,140
Well, Ada's fierce at everything.

568
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:17,220
At least in the screenshot, she looks great. Uh, one thing that doesn't have fans quite as

569
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:23,060
excited was some of this news that came out about the dog. Um, you see in the original

570
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:28,820
Resident Evil four, there's a dog that you can save from a trap. But, uh, in the footage,

571
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:33,940
it was seen that the trap has already taken care of the dog. And it doesn't seem like you can

572
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:38,340
share the dog anymore. Uh, the dog was killed in a very gruesome way in the footage. And it's

573
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:46,020
pretty upsetting to see now. I, is it the same dog? I don't know. But anyway, I, you know what?

574
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,740
You can also just be the recording.

575
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:53,060
It could be. Well, and here's the other thing. It's, it's so interesting to me. Like I,

576
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:58,660
I'm like, I don't like to see dead dogs in video games either. And I don't like to see dead cats

577
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:04,420
at all. Dead people. I'm sure they did something wrong. Let them be killed. But when I see the

578
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:10,500
animals, I don't like it. I'm like, why can't they replace the dog with a person? That's where my

579
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:20,980
brain's at right now. But anyway, hopefully the video was a misdirect and you will still be able

580
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:29,540
to save the dog. Um, but the early footage does not look good. In fact, um, one of my favorite

581
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:34,980
reactions to this whole thing was the, um, Twitter account. Do you guys follow? Can you pet the dog

582
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:43,140
on Twitter? It's a really good Twitter account. And what they do is they actually, um, talk about

583
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:48,340
in different games. Uh, they answer the question, are you able to pet the dog or not? And in this

584
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:54,420
game, all they had to say about this was quite simply, um, what the fuck was all they said about

585
01:11:54,420 --> 01:12:00,260
this? Oops. Sorry. Some additional noises coming in from the video there, but yeah,

586
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:04,420
all they had to say about that was what the fuck? I thought that was-

587
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,780
Say that about everything, every day.

588
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:15,380
So, all right. Um, yeah. Darktitsia in chat says, yeah, says it all. Pretty much. Let's just,

589
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:19,620
and Darktitsia says someone on Twitter claims it might be a misdirect. So here's hoping. Here's

590
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:24,020
hoping you can still save the dog, uh, just like you could in the original Resident Evil 4. But

591
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:29,860
yeah, I know those remakes are coming and people are very excited about it. Um, let's talk about

592
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:35,060
our next story. This might be a difficult one with some content warnings here for some folks to hear

593
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:41,220
about, but it's necessary to talk about, right Dark Sakura? Yeah. So I'm sure that a lot of

594
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:49,220
people have been following, um, the situation going on with, uh, Amaranth. Um, Amaranth, um,

595
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:56,820
had a stream where, uh, she recorded a phone conversation with her husband. She basically

596
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:03,300
had, you know, hidden the fact that she was married, presumably on his suggestion that it

597
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:11,060
would like help her brand and, and everything. Um, but she recorded a conversation with him

598
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:18,180
showing how abusive he was and talking about controlling her finances and cutting her off

599
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:25,860
from things and, and everything. So, um, she finally came out and talked about it. The,

600
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:33,620
the stream, uh, the, the video is available, uh, to see, um, on Twitch. It's still on her channel,

601
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:42,500
A-M-O-U-R-A-N-T-H, um, about 33 minutes in, uh, where it starts talking about, and it is talking

602
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:48,900
pretty heavily about abuse. Um, but, um, she's quoted saying, um, as for the husband situation,

603
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:53,860
some of you probably saw the other night he called me during a stream and I disappeared for like two

604
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:58,660
hours. Then I finally unmuted about an hour and a half into the call and I apologize if that was

605
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:06,420
hard to watch for people. I didn't really know what else to do. Um, and then apparently he heard

606
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:13,860
himself on the recording and like finally dug in what he sounds like. And so he's off getting help.

607
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:20,260
And then, and she says, uh, that she has access to all of her accounts and finances again,

608
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:29,060
and is seeking, uh, legal and emotional counsel. And I like this one too. I actually was watching

609
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:33,300
some of it. Um, I like this quote. I didn't think that many people would give a shit to be honest.

610
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:37,700
It's kind of crazy. Even haters like, damn, I fucking hate Amaranth, but you know what? I hope

611
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:51,300
she's okay. That's so nice. You know? Um, and so, uh, uh, I think that domestic abuse

612
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:59,140
is especially as a spouse that tries to control everything about your life. And I've watched my

613
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:08,100
mom go through this, you know, abuse isn't just being, you know, hit or injured. It's words,

614
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:13,940
it's actions, it's deeds, it's controlling. It's the sense of dominance where you feel

615
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:22,020
utterly powerless and it eats and eats and eats and eats at you. And, and I, I know this, I mean,

616
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:27,220
not with Dan. Dan's great. Um, besides that I could handle his ass if I wanted to. Um, I know

617
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:34,580
I always make the joke. He knows he makes the joke. But, um, but the, the thing is, is that

618
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:39,940
I grew up in a pretty abusive household. Um, I haven't made any secret of it, but you know,

619
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:45,060
I'm not going to go into extra detail. And a lot of it was emotional, uh, trying to control,

620
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:55,220
trying to dominate. Um, and I, I I've seen people go through it. I have gone through a degree of it

621
01:15:55,620 --> 01:16:04,260
and it really just, I'm glad that she's out from, from under him, that hopefully him getting help

622
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:12,900
is actually what does the job. Um, and, uh, the police, now this is what's disgusting to me is

623
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:17,380
that she said that she'd gone to the police before to explain a situation, but they would not take

624
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:24,100
any action unless she had suffered physical harm. That's bullshit. Abuse is abuse.

625
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:31,300
Abuse is abuse. And if someone comes in saying, I don't feel safe in my home, you take care of it.

626
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:36,740
This is how people die is why don't another reason I don't trust the police. I'm just saying,

627
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:45,060
you know, I I've, I've seen it happen where a person will go over and over and say, Hey,

628
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:50,340
I'm not feeling safe or Hey, he's doing this or Hey, this is happening. And then finally

629
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:56,340
she ends up dead because police wouldn't do shit. Fucking disgusting. You know?

630
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:01,140
But anyway, can I just a quick aside, but it literally, and I know this is going to

631
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:04,420
come off weird, but like I have to say it, it kind of reminds me of the whole thing.

632
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:08,340
Cause you know, that, that Dahmer series on Netflix is all over the news. I refuse to

633
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:12,340
watch it. I know. I know. I completely understand why people have their reservations about that. But

634
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:16,980
I, one of the scenes I saw, I haven't seen the show, but I saw a scene. I really like

635
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:22,420
Niecy Nash who's in it. Um, and she plays a part and she's in a scene where she's trying to get

636
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:27,060
help for one of the victims, but police won't do anything about it because it didn't meet a certain

637
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:32,980
criteria. And it just like, like screaming internally, like knowing how that ends. Anyway,

638
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:38,980
I'm sorry. I don't mean to, but it's just like, it's like, you kind of see it happening there

639
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:43,620
too. And that situation is to see, we kind of look at it and go, why aren't we getting people

640
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:49,780
that are asking for help, help? And this is not uncommon. Yeah. This happens more often

641
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:57,460
than is advertised. This is just more, uh, uh, ingrained misogyny.

642
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:06,260
You know, it, the, they're not there to protect people. I'll just leave that there. Um, but one

643
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:11,220
thing that she said that really, you know, strikes a chord with me is that she says she's looking

644
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:16,660
forward to having friends again, sleeping, being able to wear clothes that she wants,

645
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:21,940
you know, take, and that she is going to take time to process things, spend time with her dogs,

646
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:30,100
uh, feel like a person. And I get that too. You know, after, after, um, my mom and my stepdad

647
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:38,100
divorced, I kind of had to figure out who I was, you know, out from under being scared all the

648
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:48,420
time. Um, so I want to also take this, uh, this moment to say that if you, anyone who

649
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:55,060
hears my voice, if you are in an emotionally abusive relationship, you can get help.

650
01:18:56,020 --> 01:19:01,700
Um, you know, if you are cut off from your family and friends, or you're isolated,

651
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:05,540
if they've cut off your, your funding, take control of your finances,

652
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:19,220
um, that's abuse. That is abuse right there. Um, there are, um, there are, uh, there's a national

653
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:26,820
domestic violence hotline here in the US. In the UK, there's crisis text line. Um, UK also has

654
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:34,100
domestic and sexual abuse, uh, helpline as well, phone as well as email. And if you feel, um, that

655
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:40,980
you are in immediate danger and coming under harm, you contact emergency services, even if they don't

656
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:46,820
do anything, you'll have a paper trail. It has to be processed. And if they say, oh, we're not gonna,

657
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:54,180
you know, do anything, you ask them why they're refusing to, you know, to record the situation

658
01:19:54,260 --> 01:20:02,020
and you seek legal counsel, if you can. There are plenty of pro bono legal services for domestic

659
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:09,300
abuse victims. And yeah, do it. You know what else I'm sadly reminded of when you talk about

660
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,900
the controlling of the finances and what she was doing and all that, I'm reminded of the Britney

661
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:18,980
Spears situation. And, um, that was abuse. Absolutely. And that was, but it was also

662
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:27,060
sanctioned by the government. The government gave that dad legal rights to do this. Like it's, it's,

663
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:32,260
it's, but I know, I know that the conservatorship is a whole nother thing, but I can't help but be

664
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:38,260
reminded as we talk about the system being set up to fail many of these individuals.

665
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:46,260
It's being set up to control women, to silence us and to, you know, keep the cisgender white male

666
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:51,460
in, in charge or white straight male, whatever Christian dude in charge,

667
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:56,740
because that is default in this country. Um, and I'm sure there's people out there

668
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:59,300
that are like, what the fuck are you doing talking about this? This is, is this really

669
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:05,540
about video games? Absolutely. On top of that, she's, she's a Twitch streamer.

670
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:10,740
Yeah. That's what I'm saying. There's, there's a lot into, I'm, I'm sure people didn't care for her

671
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:17,300
because maybe I don't, I don't know this streamer at all. This was the first I heard of Amaranth

672
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:21,380
and I saw the videos and, you know, I was like, Oh my gosh, this is, this is horrible. I hope she's

673
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:24,980
okay. It was like literally the thoughts going through my video. And I'm very glad to hear she's

674
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:28,740
where she needs to be. She's getting help. That makes me feel great. Just, you know, I don't know

675
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:33,780
her as a streamer. I'm not going to profess to know, but like, it appears that if she was

676
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:39,460
unpopular, perhaps people saw that it was a calculated presentation that she was putting out

677
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:46,260
on stream. Maybe what they didn't know is who was calculating it. And now a lot of that has come,

678
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:51,940
come to light now. I was to say all that aside, I think it just shows a deeper level that like

679
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:57,060
streamers, and this includes me, Loki and Jamie. This includes many of the people that you watch.

680
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:03,780
Streamers are real fucking people with real fucking people problems. And I go ahead. So I

681
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:09,780
don't mean to keep cutting. I had to cut out, um, a streamer out of my life for,

682
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:15,380
I'm not going to go too much into detail on it, but for being a very toxic and abusive

683
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:22,580
individual who pretty much is so self centered, they can't see how what they do affects other

684
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:30,980
people. And as someone who has been through, um, domestic abuse as a child, you know, both

685
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:38,820
emotional, everything. I hit that block button within five seconds. You don't be afraid to cut

686
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:47,380
someone out of your life if they are causing you distress. Well, and I'm also going to say,

687
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:52,580
you know, knowing that she is unpopular, quote, I'm using my quotey fingers and so forth.

688
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:57,460
She's unpopular. I'm sure. Well, there's clearly she said in that statement, even my haters. So

689
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:03,220
she has haters, right? My point is, and my point is, watch how much of that hate you're putting

690
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:08,340
out online, because we are real fucking people, right? And luckily, we don't have to deal with

691
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:12,340
that at the level. I mean, we've all dealt with it in one way or another. But Amaranth certainly

692
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:17,380
dealt with it a lot more. My point is, why put all that negativity out there in the first place?

693
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:22,100
Because you don't know what struggles people are having when the cameras are off. So it costs

694
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:27,780
nothing to be kind. Thank you. That's a very succinct way to put it. It costs nobodies to

695
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:36,340
be kind. My, my, my former manager at my job used to have this placard outside of this cubicle that

696
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:44,420
said be kind because everybody is fighting a hard battle. Yeah. So and that's why I think this is

697
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:49,220
more than appropriate to be discussing here, especially as Twitch culture is gaining more

698
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:55,460
and more. I mean, we just talked about yesterday, or sorry, not yesterday, last week, it felt like

699
01:23:55,460 --> 01:24:00,900
yesterday, we just talked about last week, the death of a traditional gaming network.

700
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:08,820
Because it can't compete with where modern viewing eyes are going. And that's Twitch and YouTube and

701
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:14,900
those sorts of custom created things. There was a whole insider article on that G4 debacle this

702
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:23,620
week that was shared in our discord over at vognetwork.com. That was very enlightening. I

703
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:29,460
thought that whole article was very interesting. There's another factor to consider too. This goes

704
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:36,820
beyond just streaming but goes into the realm of like multiplayer games. Voice Chat is still

705
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:46,740
a very toxic environment for women and female presenting people who go into multiplayer chats.

706
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:51,940
Well, and you remember I got bullied off of Twitch once already I was on there in 2017.

707
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:58,260
But I mean, now I've got a really good supportive community, especially now that you know,

708
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,620
I've made those cuts.

709
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:04,260
Well, and you know, the OL army's got your back. You know, you always we have a we have a small by

710
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:08,740
Twitch standards, but loyal few and we heart you all so much for that.

711
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:14,900
Yeah, we absolutely do. But I mean, the other thing too is that always I have to remind myself

712
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:19,620
and this was something that it took me a while to learn after escaping that situation is that

713
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:28,420
the people who are like that they don't know you. They haven't taken the time to get to know you.

714
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:36,020
Why? Why let them hurt you? You know, if they're and if they're in your home,

715
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:43,380
and they're using what they know of you to be this person, then you owe it to yourself

716
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:51,300
to value yourself more than what then their words. If you're in a dangerous situation,

717
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:56,660
there are ways of getting out of it. There are places that will help you. There are ways of

718
01:25:56,740 --> 01:26:02,900
hiding your location hiding your identity from people that would track you. The help is there.

719
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:06,660
All right, that's it.

720
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:12,420
Let's move on to some more stories. We'll go into our next story kind of going back to

721
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:18,100
some of the mainstream game news and some games that won't be around much longer. Right, Loki?

722
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:23,220
Yeah, it's just typical EA. So they're shutting that's all you need to say.

723
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:28,420
Oh, now in the news tonight. EA is being EA Thank you. See you next week.

724
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,660
They're shutting down. Well, I mean, to be fair, Ubisoft is the same thing.

725
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:39,460
Recently as well, but they're just as bad. So they're shutting down some old servers for

726
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:47,940
some older games that you may have played. So including, of course, we have, you know,

727
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:52,660
these are actually as of even last week, they already shut down some of the servers. So we

728
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:58,820
had army of two, the 40th day and army of two, the devil's cartel, as well as Dragon Age origins,

729
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:04,900
the multiplayer screenshots server has been shut down. November 9, they're going to be shutting

730
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:09,060
down the command and conquer red alert three command and conquer three Tiberium Wars and

731
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:16,100
command conquer three canes raft as well as mercenary to world in flames. That's those are

732
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:21,060
all going to be shut down November 9 on rush is going down, which is not even that old.

733
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:31,300
November 30. And then finally, January 19, they're going to be putting out was it mirrors edge NBA

734
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:41,620
jam on fire edition gatling gears and shank two are all going down. So that's, that's annoying.

735
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:48,020
So what this will how this will affect your games. Some of these you know, they're you're

736
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:53,140
just not gonna be able to play obviously online some of them it will block some of the achievements

737
01:27:53,140 --> 01:28:00,420
that required you to be online in order to get those as well. So yeah, that kind of sucks. If

738
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:05,380
you're if you're looking to get those achievements. Some of those may be too late on but you know,

739
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:10,180
I'm used all the time dark to see and chat says well to be fair mirrors edge has been up since

740
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:14,900
2008. Don't encourage them. No, I mean, I get it. Nothing can really last forever in that regard.

741
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:18,980
But yeah, as Joe and Matt says, I was honestly surprised some of those servers are still up

742
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:24,900
mostly mirrors edge. The achievement aspect does suck. Yeah. So I mean, I think I like to think

743
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:30,180
developers have learned a lot since designing those earlier Xbox 360 style achievements like

744
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:35,060
you know, achievements have been in our in our industry for God probably 15 years now, right?

745
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:40,740
So I think developers for the most part of guidance gotten smarter at making more everlasting

746
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:44,820
achievements that don't necessarily require the game to you'll play in multiplayer mode.

747
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:50,820
There's still a few of those out there. But yeah, I feel like we're starting to see less of those

748
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:55,380
that really rely on the you know, multiplayer and online features because most games, you know,

749
01:28:55,380 --> 01:29:00,100
especially if you're Babylon's fall. There's a lot of games that don't last even a year sometimes

750
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,540
find out the Final Fantasy mobile game. What the hell was that that one they just pulled out the

751
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:09,060
Final Fantasy seven spin off mobile. Yeah, I don't remember now, which clearly made an impact if I

752
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:16,420
can't even remember the fucking name. So anyway, mobile game Battle Royale Final Fantasy some Yeah.

753
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:23,140
All right. And Mike Defton chats is not even Prime Minister's last that long. Oh,

754
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:29,940
I love a good callback joke. Thank you very much. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about another

755
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:33,860
story which has to do with Microsoft and maybe something they're planning for in the future.

756
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:39,300
It is a branded mobile game store. But that's interesting to me because I go,

757
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:44,740
but Xbox and Microsoft tried to do the mobile phones and that didn't really last. They didn't

758
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:50,740
really get into that. So what exactly are they doing? Well, they have done a filing with UK's

759
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:55,540
Competition and Markets Authority or the CMA. And they're having to do this because they're

760
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:59,860
basically the CMA has a lot of questions about the Activision Blizzard merger, and it almost

761
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:04,660
looks like they don't want to approve it. So Xbox has kind of had to show a little bit about

762
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:10,660
what the plans are to do a next gen Xbox store that would be on mobile devices, as well as

763
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:17,460
console and PCs. And I see some of this today because like if you look like even on, you know,

764
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:23,060
Google or Apple, there is an Xbox app that allows you to interact with the store for your consoles

765
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:27,860
or your PC, like you can download game pass games, and like have them queue up. So they're there when

766
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:32,820
you get home and doing that through mobile. So it makes a little bit of sense that maybe Microsoft

767
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:39,060
is looking to kind of expand that into other games that are just game pass and maybe for mobile games

768
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:43,860
as well. I'm not sure how that works. I mean, because I'm pretty sure the rules of Apple,

769
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:48,820
at least if not maybe Google as well, would prevent them from doing that within an app.

770
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:53,140
But you can do anything through the web, which is where they went for their cloud based gaming. So

771
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:57,300
maybe it's going to be a web app. I don't know. But what we do know is that they're looking at

772
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:03,460
this for things like Call of Duty mobile, the more casual games, because remember, it's Activision

773
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:09,140
Blizzard King, and King really lives in this space like Candy Crush and that stuff too, right?

774
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:14,020
So it is something they're looking at. And they have said it will require a major shift in consumer

775
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:19,300
habits with the competition that's currently out there. They are going to apply the open app store

776
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:25,540
philosophy to the Xbox mobile shop, and so on and so on. So it's, it's interesting that they're going

777
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:32,100
this way. They're having to show this again, because of the merger that they want to do.

778
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:35,700
So we know some of their future plans in this, because they want to get through

779
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:40,900
the merger with the CMA and have that approved. Because there's a lot of talk about is it going

780
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:45,860
to be approved? And it sounds like if it's not approved, it's all Bobby Kotick's fault.

781
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:48,660
I don't understand how he is still.

782
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:53,460
There's someone who needs to be dropped into a pit.

783
01:31:53,940 --> 01:32:01,140
Just, just fade into obscurity. Just honestly. So like the, that's the,

784
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:07,860
that's the person that needs to stick to theater is Bobby Kotick. My gosh. All right. Anyhow,

785
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:13,140
let's go back to a simpler time. I was gonna say a simpler time when there wasn't mobile games.

786
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:18,980
But actually, I don't think that's the case tonight. But let's roll the official bump, please.

787
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:34,500
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault

788
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:39,940
and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

789
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:45,780
And Dark Soccer, I have a feeling you're picking one of those games that we don't want to believe

790
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:52,260
is 10 years old, but it is, huh? Yeah, and I did it for you actually.

791
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:58,260
Oh, I do like this game. Yeah. So anyway, the game is Giana Sisters

792
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:04,420
Twisted Dreams. It was a platformer developed by Black Forest Games for Windows. And it is

793
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:12,740
the successor to the 1987 Commodore 64 title, The Great Giana Sisters, and a sequel to the

794
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:19,060
reimagining Giana Sisters DS. It's a crowdfunded game with Kickstarter, and it hits a goal of

795
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:31,060
$150,000. In addition to that Windows release, there's been a console port. There's other things

796
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:36,820
going on, a little drama, but we'll get to that in a second. So that's for the plot of the game.

797
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:42,980
Maria is abducted to the dream world, and a dragon is holding her prisoner, and Giana

798
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:53,940
has to go enter the dream world to get her. And so she can manipulate her dreams to switch between

799
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:59,860
dreams and be a cute or punk persona to deal with different things as she goes along.

800
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:12,980
So after Giana Sisters DS came out, Spellbound Entertainment went bankrupt, and Armin Gesserit

801
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:20,420
died. And so Black Forest Games was founded by key members from Spellbound and took over all

802
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:28,740
the Spellbound's assets, including all the intellectual property. So they worked on the

803
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:39,060
Giana Sisters title beginning in early 2011. There were conditions that were put on them in

804
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:46,500
order for the game to see a release, and so they wanted a lot cut out. So they were really working

805
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:50,340
on it. I mean, people kept thinking that it was a copycat of Super Mario Brothers, but they really

806
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:57,140
were trying to change it into something unique. And so it turned into what was called Project

807
01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:07,060
Giana so they could transform. And so the world changes when she changes, and there's all kinds

808
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:17,780
of other stuff, different attacks that they have in each form. And what they did with this one,

809
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:26,260
they went for a 3D design instead of the DS's 2D design. And then they thought about shelving

810
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:33,780
the game so they could try to fund it themselves. But the Kickstarter was so successful that they

811
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:38,660
kept going, kept doing the crowdfunding, they kept making it happen, and they hit their goal on July

812
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:49,860
30th, 2012. So with the fundraiser, they announced Xbox Live Arcade and PSN support. The stretchy

813
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:57,140
goal was that it would be a 16-level release and a full version 20-level release at $200,000.

814
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:04,100
And if it hit the goal, there was going to be Ouya support for $300,000.

815
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,380
Oh no, not that.

816
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:08,340
Well, this is right when it came out.

817
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:12,980
I know. It's wild to me that we're talking about Kickstarter-backed games and the classic Game

818
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:16,420
of the Week segment, but it is 10 years old. It's just wild to me.

819
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:18,900
To be fair, at least it came out.

820
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:24,340
That's more than we can say about some other recent consoles.

821
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:36,340
As I was saying, they hit that goal and amassed a total of $186,159 on the official Kickstarter

822
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:42,980
and then reached $190,000 when PayPal pledges were added in. They had a livestream to celebrate

823
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:46,820
and they had interviews and all kinds of stuff.

824
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:54,340
On August 30th, 2012, Project Giana was among the first to be featured on Valve's Steam Greenlight.

825
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:01,540
October 15th, 2012, it was a fully greenlit for release on Steam.

826
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:09,140
Fans were invited to vote for their title to be used. So there was also Twisted Dream,

827
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:11,380
Giana's Twisted Dream, or Project Giana.

828
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:17,460
And so the game was revealed to be Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams on September 21st, 2012.

829
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:25,060
The music had the original composer for the first great Giana Sisters, Chris Hulsbeck,

830
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:33,540
and the Swedish heavy metal band Maschine Supremacy, and Fabian Del Priore, who worked

831
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:37,380
on Giana Sisters DS. And the soundtrack is actually really freaking good.

832
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:42,660
The CD was offered as a reward on the Kickstarter.

833
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:50,900
So as for the release, it was originally a digital release October 23rd, 2012. That's today.

834
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:53,140
Wow.

835
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:54,180
It's the anniversary.

836
01:37:54,180 --> 01:37:55,140
Exactly. Wow.

837
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:58,500
Yeah. Did I time it or did I time it?

838
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,300
Timed it pretty well.

839
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:07,860
The DLC was released on September 26th, 2013 for Windows. And if you backed the Kickstarter,

840
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:09,220
you got it for free.

841
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:11,460
I did. Backed the Kickstarter.

842
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:16,180
Rise of the Alverlord could be purchased by itself as a standalone game.

843
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:21,540
On September 5th, 2013, Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams was released for the Wii U.

844
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:26,900
It was a physical director's cut for PS4 and Xbox One on December 12th, 2014.

845
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:32,260
And it included Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams Rise of the Alverlord.

846
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:36,340
That's O-W-L, if you think I'm saying it funny.

847
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:42,180
And then the Ultimate Edition was released on the Switch September 25th, 2018.

848
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:47,220
It had the director's cut and five more levels and cut scenes.

849
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:54,900
It was met pretty favorably. It got pretty decent scores. It looks beautiful.

850
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:58,580
People love that you can immerse yourself in the world.

851
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:04,580
At Destructoid, it was said that it was a labor of Euro love.

852
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:11,700
And they said it was very polished controls and excellent gameplay.

853
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:14,500
Lots of stuff to find in this game.

854
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:20,820
One of the things that I think is interesting, though, is that they promised a Mac and Linux

855
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:28,420
version after they did the Humble Indie Bundle 11 in February 2014, but hasn't been released.

856
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:34,660
And the Switch version was released by Handy Games, which is a THQ Nordic subsidiary.

857
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:37,460
And so that's it.

858
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,500
All right. Great pick.

859
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:47,780
Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, a game that literally barely makes the cut as a 10-year-old game.

860
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:52,660
But wow, it's just fascinating to think how far we've come in 10 years.

861
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:55,780
But this game still looks really good today, to be honest.

862
01:39:56,820 --> 01:40:00,180
Yeah, it totally would fit in any sort of modern release.

863
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:03,300
Absolutely. And I've played this game a little bit before.

864
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:08,500
It's interesting. Giana Sisters, the original in Commodore 64, is really known for two things.

865
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:13,540
It's known for the Mario Brothers lawsuit because it took a lot of cues from Mario

866
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:17,700
Brothers and had a lot of various similarities to it, and even the name reminiscent of Mario

867
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:22,500
Brothers. And then the music. The music was incredible in the Commodore 64 version of the

868
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:29,380
game. Ask anybody who follows chiptunes of that era, like top 10 soundtracks from Commodore 64,

869
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:31,460
Giana Sisters is going to be on it every single time.

870
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:37,060
So it's interesting, but the game itself wasn't very good.

871
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:42,020
It's going to have its defenders. There's people that are going to say I'm wrong.

872
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:49,140
Too bad. It isn't very good. However, the sequel, the this one is a good game.

873
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:54,180
And because it came up, it wasn't just a Mario Brothers rip off, it came up with the whole idea

874
01:40:54,180 --> 01:41:02,500
of the switching and all that stuff that I think works a lot better. So yeah, I think it works

875
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:08,580
great. And it just yeah, it just was a great game as a result. And it's interesting to see

876
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:12,820
a game that was the subject of a lawsuit and controversy back in the Commodore 64 games

877
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:16,660
really get like a second and even third life because the DS version was out there.

878
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:19,860
But then this one, I think a lot more people saw because of Kickstarter and

879
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,620
it's been given away. It's a true sequel.

880
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:27,700
Yeah, it's a real true sequel. And really evolved on the formula.

881
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:33,780
Yeah, for sure. All right, let's travel around and check out some rapid fire news.

882
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:39,460
And we'll start with Loki. Yeah. So we've been having this trend

883
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:44,180
lately where folks will decompile a game and then, well, they will decompile it.

884
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:51,780
They'll basically recreate the code from scratch, reverse engineer it. And so the next game to

885
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:56,900
fit that bill is going to be Perfect Dark, the original game that was out on Nintendo 64.

886
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:09,060
They have made they've been able to recreate the game, release a reverse engineer, I guess.

887
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:15,540
And now it is ported to PC. And you, of course, can, you know,

888
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:20,900
up the resolution, do all sorts of crazy stuff with that you wouldn't have been able to before.

889
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:29,140
And, you know, what they basically this is actually now a process that uses, I think,

890
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:33,460
the actual and I don't know if it uses the actual N64 ROM to revert.

891
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:37,380
You have to have the ROM and then reverse engineer it with that using a tool.

892
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:43,060
But either way, you end up being able to play it on PC and it runs negatively,

893
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:47,140
which is pretty awesome. So I'm sure that's out there on the web,

894
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:52,180
ready for Nintendo or actually, I don't know, it's a rare game, but maybe Nintendo will smack

895
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:55,380
it down. Maybe Microsoft smack it down. Somebody will smack it down.

896
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:03,220
And then there is a brand new Mortal Kombat game called Onslaught, which is coming out for mobile.

897
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:11,300
And it is a they call it a mobile exclusive cinematic story experience for the series.

898
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:17,060
Cool, I guess. Cool, if you're into mobile games.

899
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:24,740
Yeah, it's yeah, it's a reimagined Mortal Kombat into a strategic team based collection RPG with

900
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:29,780
fast. Yeah, it sounds like literally almost most of the mobile games out there. But yeah,

901
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:36,260
if you want one with a Mortal Kombat, you know, layer of paint on it. Here you go.

902
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:36,840
Enjoy.

903
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:46,180
Let's talk about Mario Party. Jason kind of mentioned it in the intro. Not to it's not

904
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:50,340
Mario Party three. It's actually Mario Party one. But do you remember the box art for the original

905
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:56,100
Mario Party? It made it look like it was Mario Party three, because the the way the box art was,

906
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:59,380
I have it. I have a copy of it here. I can show on the other screen real quick.

907
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:04,580
It had the dice on it. And so it looked like it was Mario Party three. I don't know. But it's

908
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:11,460
actually the original Mario Party. Mario Party one and two are coming out for the switch online

909
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:18,500
expansion pack. You know, the backwards compatible Nintendo 64 library. So pilot wing 64 just came

910
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:23,460
out this last month. And Nintendo has confirmed that Mario Party and Mario Party two are coming

911
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:27,860
out for the Switch Online expansion pack. And they're coming out for the Nintendo 64

912
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:34,580
and Mario Party two will be arriving on November 2. So if you are ready to ruin friendships online,

913
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:40,820
through playing online with the Nintendo Switch Online plan, you can you can do that. So if you

914
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:45,940
want to make enemies coast to coast, you have that ability through a Mario Party. Of course,

915
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:50,260
there's also Mario Party games that exist on Switch. But you know, if you want to classically

916
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:55,700
ruin friendships, you can do that with the original Mario Party one and two. In a little

917
01:44:55,700 --> 01:45:01,700
bit more of a traditional game type of news also coming for the switch but also PlayStation five

918
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:09,780
Xbox series PlayStation four Xbox one is right in three cross Mikado maniacs. This is coming out on

919
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:16,580
February 23, 2023. It will be out in Japan for 3800 yen. There's also gonna be a 7200 yen limited

920
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:24,100
edition which has a diorama you know you need that to soundtrack CD and a special box. So this is

921
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:29,220
right in three, but it has background music remixes by artists that are produced by games

922
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:33,700
that are Akado like if you want to know like what is that whole name about? So you get basically

923
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:39,140
different music in there. Some of the artists include heavy metal right and reuse star for

924
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:44,180
those of you that follow on Konami series that might sound familiar to you. Daisuke Matsumoto,

925
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:49,060
so she hosts I and so on and so on. So there's a lot of cool stuff in there over 20 enhanced

926
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:53,700
background music tracks are coming which is pretty cool. So that is all coming out

927
01:45:53,700 --> 01:46:01,460
on February 23. And darted see it says, I'm kind of hyped for this. I have the sequel right in four

928
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:06,260
cross Mikado. And they have some of their stuff on YouTube if you want to hear it. If you love heavy

929
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:12,660
metal, and who doesn't, this stuff is going to be your jam. So very cool. Alright, well, let's

930
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:16,900
travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner than right in

931
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:25,060
three cross Mikado. We have dungeons of aether, which is by the folks that made rivals of aether.

932
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:33,540

935
01:46:54,340 --> 01:47:01,860
Nintendo Switch. We have aquarium on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four. It's a visual novel,

936
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:10,180
not a not a fish sim sorry. Decapo for fortunate departures on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four

937
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:21,860
gunfire reborn on Xbox one and Xbox series. Needy streamers overlord overload that is a weird

938
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:28,260
looking game. Needy streamer overlord overload not overlord. That's a whole different game.

939
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:36,900
Nintendo Switch sack boys big adventure on PC. We have signalists on PC, Nintendo Switch,

940
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:44,100
PlayStation four and Xbox one star ocean the divine force on PC, PlayStation four,

941
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:50,500
PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series. Also, it appears that we have ace angler

942
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:56,340
fishing spirits on Nintendo Switch. I'm guessing these are different regions probably for that.

943
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:05,620
Also, we've got Bayonetta three, a game of no controversy whatsoever coming out on

944
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:12,340
Nintendo Switch. Call of Duty, Modern Warfare two. It's like I'm back several decades ago.

945
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:19,380
No, this is a new one, and that is on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one

946
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:27,860
and Xbox series and does look pretty good. Chris, let's see, we've got crystallize on PC,

947
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:37,460
dungeon munchies on PlayStation four and PlayStation five. Resident Evil reverse on

948
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:46,740
PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one. And Yamawari lost in the dark also coming out on PC,

949
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:52,420
Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four. I'm guessing this is also another region,

950
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:56,420
European release date. I don't know why that's on my release dates, but whatever.

951
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:01,220
All right, that is it. We're traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases on the

952
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:06,820
Nintendo Switch this week. We have Needy Girl Overdose, but it's in English, but it is getting

953
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:11,940
a Japanese release this week on the 27th. DC 4 Decapo, Fortunate Departures, also out in Japan

954
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:17,220
this week on the Switch. Ace Angler Fishing Spirits in an English and a multi-language

955
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:22,420
release, two separate releases. A game called Aquarium gets a release as well. There's also

956
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:26,420
a special Dead by Daylight, Sadako Rising, official Japanese version. So I'm assuming

957
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:32,180
that comes with the Ringu DLC that was, it's been out for some while, but it's just a re-release of

958
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:36,740
that because I think DVD is gaining popularity in Japan actually. And it's in part, thanks to some

959
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:41,860
of these characters they're including. A game called SnowRunner is getting a price reduction.

960
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:47,140
That's pretty cool. As well as a game called Signalus is coming out on the Switch this week

961
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:52,740
in Japan. There's also a split pad fit coming out for the Nintendo Switch. There's one for Gengar

962
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:59,380
and Pikachu. Oh, these are, oh, I see what this is. They're like joy cons that make your controller

963
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:04,100
like bigger. It's kind of neat. It makes the buttons kind of all in a different place. So

964
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:10,180
it's kind of neat. So that is coming out. If you, you know, you need better grips on your

965
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:15,380
Nintendo Switch, check that out in Japan this week. Also, of course, Bayonetta 3. Interesting

966
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:20,500
though, because earlier in the show, we were talking about, um, Japanese voice actors and

967
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:28,100
so forth. Uh, the release for Japan is marked as English. So I'm not sure if they did localization

968
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:33,460
for this. Uh, it may still be in English, uh, maybe with Japanese subtitles. Just,

969
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:37,780
I just noticed that on the releases, they do say this is in English. So kind of interesting,

970
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:44,180
but that is it for the Switch this week, going to the PlayStation 5, uh, and looking at the

971
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:49,460
releases there, Star Ocean, the Defying Force is out on October 27th, as well as again, the Dead

972
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:53,460
by Daylight, Sadako Rising is also on PlayStation 5, cause you know, that game's everywhere.

973
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:59,220
Uh, The Legend of Heroes, Kuro no Kiseuke 2 is out this week, uh, in Japan as well on the PlayStation

974
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:06,900
5. So pretty busy week, but understandable. It was a busy week in music as well. So it's a very

975
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:12,420
busy time. Um, I see Dark Sakura is just now sitting down. So I don't know if you want to do

976
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:16,820
Europe releases or you want me to. Oh, she's going to do it. Okay. So I'll turn it over to

977
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:21,940
Dark Sakura for the European releases. Uh, sorry about that. My voice is cutting out quite a bit

978
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:27,700
now. No worries. I just want to make sure you're okay to do it. No, I appreciate that. I appreciate

979
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:36,180
that very much. So, uh, for this week on the 25th for PlayStation and Xbox, we have Melt and Blade

980
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:42,260
2. We also have Miraculous Rise of the Sphinx also for Switch, add into that. On the 27th,

981
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:47,860
we have Star Ocean, The Divine Force on PlayStation, Xbox on the, on the big three,

982
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:56,900
Asterix Novelisk, um, on the 28th, Bayonetta 3 for Switch, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare for

983
01:51:56,900 --> 01:52:04,900
Xbox, PlayStation, Resident Evil, uh, Village Gold Edition on the same, um, Slime Rancher,

984
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:14,980
Plortable Edition on, uh, October 28th. Um, also, uh, Do Not Open on PlayStation and

985
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:23,540
Cocomelon Play with JJ on October 28th for Switch. All right. We're going to have a few more stories

986
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:28,100
and then we're going to invite your calls, uh, tonight on our Discord, vognetwork.com

987
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:34,260
slash Discord. I'll pop one more. I forgot on, on the 30th, since we'll be airing that day,

988
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:42,740
um, Aeterna Noctis on PlayStation and Switch. All right. Cool. Uh, yeah. So we'll, uh, we'll

989
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:46,660
do a few more stories and then we're going to invite your calls over at vognetwork.com

990
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:51,700
slash Discord. I know there's been some talk, uh, on the Discord as well as Bobby was mentioning

991
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:56,020
on his show tonight about, are we going to be using Twitch guest star capabilities in the future?

992
01:52:56,020 --> 01:53:01,060
The answer is more testing needs to be done to make sure that works, especially here. Um,

993
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:05,220
it's one thing for Bobby's show because it's just him. For us, I have to make sure that our guest

994
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:10,500
stars can also hear Dark Sakura and Loki. That is assuming we don't power the whole show through

995
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:14,580
guest star, which is also a possibility. So there's a lot of questions still to ask,

996
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:19,540
uh, as far as making all that work. Um, so for the time being, for now, for the foreseeable future,

997
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:22,740
we're going to keep it with our Discord and we do hope you will join our Discord. I know you're

998
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:28,980
probably in a million Discords. I promise we limit the use of at everyone to extremely minimal.

999
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:32,660
In fact, I can't think of the last time we've used it. So we really try not to send you pings,

1000
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:37,220
uh, unless like, again, I can't think of the time in the past.

1001
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:42,500
And to be fair, like, you know, it literally takes a second to shut that off anyways,

1002
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:48,580
notification wise, like literally every Discord I go, I mute it immediately and I put, I disable

1003
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:52,740
all those notifications. It takes like less than a second, especially streamer servers where they

1004
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:56,420
need to ping the whole server when they go live. I understand why people to do that. It's important

1005
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:59,700
for engagement, but Twitch already tells me when people goes live. So I don't, I don't need it

1006
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:03,940
twice. So yeah. So just, I mean, like that shouldn't really be a thing to hold you back.

1007
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:08,740
Yeah. All right. Let's move on. Uh, more stories, Loki.

1008
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:13,540
Oh boy. Let's talk about Activision. Cause you know, I'm sure all good news. And so I had to

1009
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:18,180
look up who this person was because I wasn't really sure at first, cause they didn't seem

1010
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:23,940
very professional and good communications, but apparently they are the executive, uh,

1011
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:28,580
vice president of corporate affairs and the chief communications officer, meaning that

1012
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:36,660
their communication game is 100%. So this is Lulu Cheng, um, Missouri, and, uh, she just

1013
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:42,900
joined the Activision team and she's already, already doing a bang up job by Activision

1014
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:48,820
standards. So as you may remember, the we've had a few of the departments in there start to

1015
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:55,700
unionize and there's been, of course, more talks about unionization as well. So, uh, she thought

1016
01:54:55,700 --> 01:55:02,660
it would be good to go into the Slack channels of these, um, employees and remind them that,

1017
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:10,900
Hey, you know what? Um, you probably shouldn't be talking about, um, you know, you shouldn't

1018
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:16,420
be talking about unionization because it's time consuming. It could prevent employees from getting

1019
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:25,700
raises until a deal is reached. Um, of course that was met with lots of, um, pushback from

1020
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:31,860
the employees as well. Um, this is after they're saying that we'd like a direct communication line

1021
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:35,860
with these employees and stuff like that, and we want them to be able to communicate.

1022
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:42,500
But of course, obviously they're just trying to stop the unionization is what they're trying to

1023
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:49,220
do. Um, and then what's great is, you know, when called out on this, because she's actively

1024
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:54,340
tweeting on, um, Twitter, for example, you know, they said, it's very funny to be an executive at

1025
01:55:54,340 --> 01:55:59,380
a $50 billion company and say, you're genuinely curious if there's some political or something

1026
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:04,900
political about opposing unionization. And her takeaway from that is we're actually closer to

1027
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:13,860
$60 billion. It's like tone deaf and stupid. Can you be, but apparently very, and that's,

1028
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:19,780
which moves you forward at Activision, a video game executive clueless about the industry

1029
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:27,060
on my internet. Um, when, when asked for comment about the situation, Activision spoke person,

1030
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:33,380
and clearly not the chief communication officer lower down on the list. They're not quite up to

1031
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:37,540
the Activision communication standards, but they did put out a statement saying both union and

1032
01:56:37,540 --> 01:56:41,700
both the union and company are allowed to share their perspectives on the pros and cons

1033
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:46,500
of unionization. We deeply respect the right of every eligible employee to decide whether the

1034
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:52,020
joining union have their vote counted. Yes. As we make veiled threats to them to prevent them from

1035
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:57,620
joining a union. Yes. That that's, that's, that's their, their perspectives. I can't wait to hear

1036
01:56:57,620 --> 01:57:02,660
what the legal systems perspective is on all of this. So hopefully we'll get a resolution of that

1037
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:10,740
pretty soon or Microsoft's perspective on if this person still needs to be employed. Uh, once the

1038
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:16,420
merger goes through. All right. I'm sure Microsoft has their own spokespeople, uh, perfectly capable

1039
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:23,220
of, um, you know, not tweeting, um, silly things anyway, but Hey, Twitter's probably going to be

1040
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:29,460
dead after this week anyway. So what's the matter? Might as well, might as well get in those five

1041
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:36,260
star tweets while you still can. I think it's going to happen. I I'm, I'm praying it doesn't

1042
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:41,860
and look, I'm just saying it's not who's buying it. That is necessarily the bad news for me,

1043
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:46,500
but I've already been very clear on the red line. If they reverse that ban, I'm out period,

1044
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:51,940
not sharing the platform with a criminal. That's that's it. I'll be honest. We're sharing it with

1045
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:55,540
a lot of other criminals. I know what you mean, but I'm not, not that, not that one.

1046
01:57:56,340 --> 01:58:00,260
Anyone who voted for that thing, anyone who enabled that thing and participated in the

1047
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:05,220
riots against our Capitol. Yeah. They're all criminals. I know. So I just, yeah.

1048
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:08,500
Questbuster says it was a great experiment while it lasted. Exactly. You know what,

1049
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:13,060
if it's all over after this week, I look back fondly on 15 years and a lot of people that I

1050
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:18,180
met and it'll be like, what's the next thing we're going to. We, we, we survived live journal,

1051
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:25,140
dead journal, Zanga. We survived MySpace, Friendster. Somehow we're still surviving

1052
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:30,020
Facebook. I don't know. I swear to God, I bring up Facebook on mobile. I'll see one post from a

1053
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:35,620
friend and then it's suggested posts, sponsored posts, one post from a friend, suggested posts,

1054
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:42,260
sponsored posts, one, it's like, why do I put up with this? Seriously? So social media in general.

1055
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:45,940
Oh my God. Social media is due for a reckoning and it's coming.

1056
01:58:46,740 --> 01:58:52,260
So yeah, Bobby says, wait, you see posts from friends? Uh, when I say friends, I mean people

1057
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:56,500
I met once at a party when I was intoxicated and we decided it would be a good idea to add each

1058
01:58:56,500 --> 01:59:02,020
other on Facebook. Uh, and now I see their thoughts on, you know, after they've moved

1059
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:05,540
to, um, you know, the, another part of the country, but whatever.

1060
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:10,020
I don't do Facebook at all. I honestly, I don't blame you.

1061
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:14,980
Sia Tabiri in chat says, am I the only one who survived high five? Yes, you are.

1062
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:26,660
I've tried a few other services by the way. I honestly, this is so silly. I miss LiveJournal.

1063
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:31,460
I still have my account. I like that pillow fort until I signed up for it. And then it went down

1064
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:39,780
for six months, like a week after I made my first post. All right, let's move on. I'm going to go

1065
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:44,180
ahead and take this next story, which has to do with star Wars eclipse. And we have some more

1066
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:50,020
updates on star Wars eclipse. Um, so, uh, star Wars eclipse is going to be apparently introduced.

1067
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:54,500
This is the Quantic Dream RPG in star Wars. If you were not sure what I'm talking about here,

1068
01:59:54,500 --> 02:00:00,900
a new report from sacred symbols has talked about what is happening. This game was originally

1069
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:04,500
announced at the game awards last year. So it's been a few months because you know, the game

1070
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:09,540
awards 2022 is going to be here in a few weeks, believe it or not. So usually early December,

1071
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:16,100
right? Um, the interesting thing about the sacred symbols report is that the game as far as I can

1072
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:22,340
tell is not even in production yet. Yikes, if it's that far out, but all right. Uh, but apparently

1073
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:26,820
there's some documents that talk about an overview of the game, main characters and the motivation.

1074
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:30,980
The game is being co-written by David Cage and Adam Williams, and they've done other Quantic

1075
02:00:30,980 --> 02:00:36,180
Dream titles. So that would be a huge surprise. Uh, a character named Sarah is an athletic 30

1076
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:41,060
something who is, uh, in a human like race, uh, that is apparently the lead of the game.

1077
02:00:41,060 --> 02:00:46,820
Uh, but the race in the, uh, that Sarah is from the Zaron is apparently new to the star Wars

1078
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:51,380
universe, or at least hasn't been seen in star Wars before. Uh, they pride themselves on political

1079
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:55,300
and military aggression and similar to what you'd find elsewhere in star Wars. There's little

1080
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:58,980
difference between males and females when it comes to roles and responsibilities, but there's an

1081
02:00:58,980 --> 02:01:04,580
interesting wrinkle. When a Zaron marries, their nuptials carry interesting military implications

1082
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:12,100
as they become one governing unit that works together. What? All right. Come on sci-fi.

1083
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:17,300
Uh, this is a problem because Sarah, a fanatical true believer in the violence and criminality

1084
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:22,260
regularly demonstrated by her empire is married to a character named Zendo who has a far softer

1085
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:26,900
touch. Part of the game seems to evolve around these two characters and their relationship.

1086
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:32,820
Alrighty. And lightsabers. And that star Wars eclipse in a nutshell, at least what the early

1087
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:40,020
reports are saying. All right. But we'll see. I mean, it's obviously still very early on. And if

1088
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:44,260
you, if you think you're waiting a long time for elder scrolls six, just wait on this one.

1089
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:50,900
All right. Meanwhile, Loki. Oh, I'm sure you're so excited to talk about this.

1090
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:59,300
How them mighty have fallen. Like I remember seeing will, right. Talk about, um,

1091
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:04,820
oh gosh, spore way back in the day. The last big game he did.

1092
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:11,300
If I don't think he's done a big game since 2008. So that it's been a while. That game really got

1093
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:16,100
shit. I don't think that game was great or anything, but it wasn't as bad as people make

1094
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:19,380
it out to be. I think it was a fine game. Sports a fight. It shouldn't be, it shouldn't have been

1095
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:25,860
his last game he ever made, but the internet ran him off as they usually do. Well now he's back and

1096
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:33,620
he's pitching a brand new project that he's working on called Vox verse. It is a game with

1097
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:41,620
voxel based characters that walk around and do things. And, um, also there's going to be, uh,

1098
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:48,260
apparently it ties to, I think these are based off of NFTs already and you can buy virtual real

1099
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:53,300
estate using real money. Now he should be right off the internet for this. I'm just kidding.

1100
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:58,820
And I'm just kidding. Yeah. So, uh, apparently, yeah, the vox characters are sold by a crypto

1101
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:07,700
firm called, um, gala games. It was spent $25 million funding vox verse. Um, you know,

1102
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:14,660
we'll write said that he does. I don't want to really, I don't really want to be in the business

1103
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:22,260
of selling NFTs. Um, I have, he says, I, the reason he's interested in blockchains, I have,

1104
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:29,540
I want to have a secure transactions for content creators and yeah.

1105
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:36,180
It's an interesting perspective. I will give him that. And I can see, you know,

1106
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:40,660
he's trying to distance himself from the whole NFT thing. Cause I think even in the interview,

1107
02:03:40,660 --> 02:03:45,540
like he wasn't saying it, it was the rep other representative that was saying that or whatever.

1108
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:49,060
And I think he's kind of trying to distance himself. So like, I will give him,

1109
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:57,540
I mean, I don't see myself playing this game. No, I'll give it a chance. Like, just like,

1110
02:03:57,540 --> 02:04:02,180
I'll say like, you know, okay. Is the game good? Question mark. And if the game's good, then,

1111
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:05,460
you know, I'm willing to try playing it and see like what this is all about. But I just,

1112
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:12,660
the, all these NFT, none of them are good. None of them. And I'll tell you what, every time

1113
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:18,500
I get spam at the OLR account, it's some fucking NFT thing. We're getting tagged in.

1114
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:23,060
It's like, again, Intel NFTs can get away from the entire criminality about them.

1115
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:29,300
They're never going to be looked at seriously by anyone. So I will say,

1116
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:34,420
Will Wright is at least being intelligent in trying to distance himself from that term NFT

1117
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:39,620
and instead be like, I want a secure marketplace for creators to be able to transact with each

1118
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:43,620
other. And hey, this one's already built, so I'm going to leverage it. Like, so I'm willing

1119
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:53,940
to give him at least a shred of like my time, but I just don't, I, you know, seeing the game

1120
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:59,060
screenshots and all this early on, it looks so generic though, but whatever. We'll see what it,

1121
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:04,980
we'll see when it comes out, if it comes out, even if it ever gets done or the NFTs lose their

1122
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:09,460
value. And then they just, you know, they have no money to fund it anymore. It feels like crypto's

1123
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:14,660
gone to a place it's never going to recover from anyway. I'm just going to make an NFT of my tongue

1124
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:22,580
and sell it to prove a point. You probably could. I'll do it to prove a point. All right.

1125
02:05:22,580 --> 02:05:26,980
What's the point? You getting money from a sucker? That's the point. Pretty much that's the point.

1126
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:34,180
All right. I'm actually going to embed it in very tiny text in the same color. A sucker bought this.

1127
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:41,140
All right. Well, let's talk one more story here tonight. A follow-up to a story a couple of weeks

1128
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:46,980
ago, we were, when we were talking about Google and Stadia and the final days of Google Stadia.

1129
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:52,340
And one question that came up was, well, what about that guy who spent 6,000 hours in Red Dead?

1130
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:57,620
Is he screwed? And the answer came out this week. No, that player is not screwed.

1131
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:06,580
An update came out from Rockstar Games saying, we are pleased to confirm that all active Stadia

1132
02:06:06,580 --> 02:06:12,020
players who played Red Dead Online within the last 30 days prior to Stadia announcing their shutdown

1133
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:18,340
will be able to carry over any earned RDO dollars, Red Dead Online bucks, gold bars, XP, roll XP,

1134
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:23,220
and roll tokens to another existing account on either PC, Xbox One or PlayStation four.

1135
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:28,260
Players will just need to have the target game account linked to their Rockstar Social Club

1136
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:31,620
account. So honestly, very similar process to what Dark Soccer has been going through with

1137
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:37,140
DBD. It's Red Dead Online. That's not a single player game. Yeah. Right. But, but here's the

1138
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:42,580
thing. Oh yeah, that's right. It's not a single player game. You're right. There is. No, they're

1139
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:47,140
talking about, they're talking about the, their, their, their fantasy books. I thought this was

1140
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:51,700
the, okay, well, that's a whole other thing then, is it? Well, the other thing I caught

1141
02:06:51,700 --> 02:06:56,820
is that it had to be the last 30 days that you played it. So you had to be a regular player of

1142
02:06:56,820 --> 02:07:02,580
this, or why do they have to limit it to just 30 days? Good, good, good Lord. Probably because

1143
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:08,100
that's how far their backups go or something like that. And maybe they only retain data for that

1144
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:15,060
long or something. Just with other games, Ubisoft confirmed that they are working with transfers to

1145
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:19,780
PC through Ubisoft Connect. Bungie and IO Interactive are also working with Destiny and

1146
02:07:19,780 --> 02:07:24,660
Hitman players about their games. So, you know, the game makers are trying to, you know, get the

1147
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:30,340
Stadia loyal back on their feet on another platform. But sometimes the restrictions are

1148
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:34,340
a little silly. I still can't wait to see if Dark Soccer basically got her entire Dead by Daylight

1149
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:39,380
collection bought and paid for by Google. Wait a second. I actually have a little bit more

1150
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:43,220
about the Dead by Daylight thing. Just a discovery that I've made on two fronts.

1151
02:07:43,220 --> 02:07:53,380
O-R-L-Y. Okay, so for Epic players, they're reporting that same 30-day deal that the

1152
02:07:53,940 --> 02:08:01,620
Red Dead folks are seeing. Now, I had, now remember how it was saying that your arc

1153
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:07,780
cells were not transferable between one and the other? I had used up as much as I could

1154
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:15,860
on my Steam side when I bought some. And then, like I had like 10. And then I've been,

1155
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:23,300
I was doing the Rift on my Stadia version, you know, getting those arc cells, spending them to

1156
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:32,100
advance the Rift because I want to use them up. And I was left with like 95. And I logged into my

1157
02:08:32,660 --> 02:08:41,300
Steam one using Boostroid and I checked it and I had 95 arc cells there unless it was a big,

1158
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:47,540
you know, coincidence. But I tested something. I got some more arc cells. I spent them. I did

1159
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:53,780
stuff with them. I was left with 60. When I logged into my Stadia account, I had 60.

1160
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:58,980
Oh, interesting. I have not seen my achievements carried over,

1161
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:02,980
but I should probably check my, I'll check my Steam account right now.

1162
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:10,820
But I'm hoping that they get the merge thing. I'm actually going to be testing it out

1163
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:20,020
probably in a week or so to see if the merge is working. Let me take a look at my Steam library,

1164
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:23,940
see what my achievements are. But I'll tell you in a second.

1165
02:09:24,260 --> 02:09:30,020
All right. Well, that was the last slot of news story we have for the night. So this is the part

1166
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:34,100
where we open it up to you all. If you want to participate with our show tonight, I think there

1167
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:36,980
were a couple of people that said they wanted to call in. So I'll give them a moment to get

1168
02:09:36,980 --> 02:09:43,220
over to our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord. If you want to join the green room

1169
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:48,020
so you can be on tonight's show, head on over there. Again, that's over at vognetwork.com

1170
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:55,780
slash discord. And you can also send us an email. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place

1171
02:09:55,780 --> 02:10:01,060
to send us an email if you want to talk about something on the show. But as I understand,

1172
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:07,780
we have no emails tonight. So you can also tweet us, twitter.com slash O-L-R. I don't think I saw

1173
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:11,700
a lot of tweet. I've been fighting out spam every time I go in there. And I bet if I go in there

1174
02:10:11,700 --> 02:10:18,020
again, there'll be more. And I report every single one. And now hearing that you know who

1175
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:27,620
wants to reduce the workforce by 75% so that those reports are going to go literally nowhere. I hope

1176
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:31,780
y'all are right. I hope something happens in the last minute to stop that deal because it's a lose

1177
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:36,820
lose proposition. He's going to lose money on it when people abandon ship because his ideas for

1178
02:10:36,820 --> 02:10:42,900
that platform are not smart. But so I did check by the way. And I only have six achievements.

1179
02:10:43,620 --> 02:10:52,580
So no, well, there's the expert survivor, master survivor, and then the, the old prestige levels.

1180
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:58,980
There's still time, we'll see what happens. All right, so let's move on. We do have somebody in

1181
02:10:58,980 --> 02:11:02,580
the green room waiting to be on the show. So let's welcome them to the show. Hello,

1182
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:04,020
you're on orange on radio. Who's this?

1183
02:11:04,980 --> 02:11:07,620
Greetings one at all is the one and only Rama.

1184
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:11,620
Rama, it's so good to hear from you. How are you? Cheers.

1185
02:11:12,580 --> 02:11:13,940
How is everybody tonight?

1186
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:19,700
Good. Yeah, it's it's always a little sad when it's Sunday, because like, oh,

1187
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:24,580
it's the end of the weekend. But I'm happy to be here doing or talking to all of you.

1188
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:28,740
I'm happy to see that there's even one person who shows up in chat. So there's a lot to be

1189
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:29,300
happy about.

1190
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:34,100
I'm all about that. And, um, let's just cut right to the chase.

1191
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:39,860
Oh, I just I'm also happy that I was completely 100% correct on that band at a three voice actor

1192
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:42,020
thing, which I think you're calling it to talk about tonight.

1193
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:45,860
Hold on, hold on. I gotta have a little drink about that.

1194
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:52,900
They can put please sip some tea. Actually, I have some tea here as well. I will I will sip on my

1195
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:58,340
tea. Let's let's spill some tea together. Oops, I spilled a little tea. Let's do that here on

1196
02:11:58,740 --> 02:11:59,860
here on tonight's OLR.

1197
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:08,180
This is the first time I've called in where I had to have to have a drink with what I had to say,

1198
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:13,620
because I'm like, I'm gonna need a drink for this. And don't worry, it's just pure coffee,

1199
02:12:13,620 --> 02:12:22,820
because that's what runs me 24 73 65. Now, I want to talk about how you mentioned people getting

1200
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:27,620
mad about voice actors asking for, you know,

1201
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:32,260
Oh, yes, the selfies and the autographs. Oh, yes.

1202
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:40,100
I'm going to tell you this right now. Those who complain are entitled sobs plain as day.

1203
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:49,780
Now, I can tell you, you can go to a comic at one time, you go to a comic convention.

1204
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:54,820
It was like it was in grown all the guests there you have to pay for an autograph.

1205
02:12:54,820 --> 02:13:01,380
You go to an anime convention. The autographs everything were free. Now,

1206
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:08,020
you go to a Gen Con of convention, not Gen Con itself, but a convention that covers

1207
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:14,740
anime, sci fi, fancy all of that. It used to be where if they were strictly anime,

1208
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:22,660
free autographs, everyone had to pay. It's changed. Now it's like most conventions regardless

1209
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:28,100
of the genre that it is, the guests appear, and you have to pay for the autographs.

1210
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:34,020
And the weebs are crying about it because they feel the money that they have spent on getting

1211
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:39,460
to the con buying their ticket, getting their hotel room and buying all that swag or their

1212
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:46,340
favorite anime or video game. But they don't want to shut out a $20 bill to get an autograph by that

1213
02:13:46,340 --> 02:13:53,300
actor who voiced their favorite anime or video game. One of my close friends is a voice actor.

1214
02:13:54,180 --> 02:14:01,460
I saw him at a convention. I got two autographs from him. And I bought them. I did not ask for

1215
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:08,340
free. I've known him for 10 plus years. I still bought them because I'm not just a friend. I'm a

1216
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:13,700
supporter of his work. So you don't go to a Starbucks your friend works at and say, Hey,

1217
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:17,460
give me free coffee because you work here. So I deserve free coffee.

1218
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:19,780
My friends used to give me free coffee when they worked at Starbucks.

1219
02:14:19,780 --> 02:14:21,460
You're not helping. You're not helping.

1220
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:24,820
I know I'm not helping. But it's a fair point.

1221
02:14:24,820 --> 02:14:30,500
It's a difference. If I say that to you, come by, I'll hook you up. That's a different story.

1222
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:37,300
Yeah, no. And do you know what? I have been very hashtag blessed. Because when I say hashtag

1223
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:40,740
blessed, I don't make it sound like I'm getting on the stage thanking God for my award and that

1224
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:46,820
whole thing. I'm very hashtag blessed to have met so many diverse people throughout the nation,

1225
02:14:46,820 --> 02:14:52,820
thanks to OLR, that there are people that have hooked me up with things. I don't want to flex.

1226
02:14:52,820 --> 02:15:00,660
But I'm just going to say, I really am thankful for the opportunities that doing something like

1227
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:01,620
this. My work discount for friends.

1228
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:05,220
People from the show, people I met through the show.

1229
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:08,820
It's too bad that I spent 18 years in health insurance and couldn't get anyone a discount,

1230
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:12,980
but it is what it is. So I don't work there anymore, which is why I'm willing to say that.

1231
02:15:12,980 --> 02:15:17,700
Anyway, also real quick aside, I just want to say I don't usually acknowledge these live at the end

1232
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:23,460
of the show. I usually talk about the gift subs and the biddies. But there is a hype train going

1233
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:28,260
on in the chat right now. And Bobby Black Wolf donated five gift subs, which was very kind of

1234
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:34,820
him to do. And then an anonymous person decided to one up him and do 10 gift subs. So whoever did

1235
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:39,380
that, that was very kind of you. Thank you. All of you. I mean, whether it was one gift sub,

1236
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:44,900
100 biddies, 500 biddies, all of you, just the fact that you do that and allow us to

1237
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:47,940
be a legitimate business, putting this on and pay our legal fees every year,

1238
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:53,700
sponsor conventions, things like that. I just want to take a minute to say, just fucking thank you.

1239
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:57,540
Like, I mean that so much. Thank you. Thanks, Ram. I just saw you chip in there too.

1240
02:15:57,540 --> 02:15:58,420
Sorry about that one.

1241
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:03,700
Get your emotes. What are we up to now? I haven't covered up. What is it? Level?

1242
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:07,060
Oh, fuck. We're level five. Damn. All right. Thank you all.

1243
02:16:07,060 --> 02:16:11,780
I've seen a level 13 hype train. It'd be great if we can make one.

1244
02:16:11,780 --> 02:16:13,780
Oh, nice try. All right.

1245
02:16:15,780 --> 02:16:17,060
You can't blame a girl for trying.

1246
02:16:17,060 --> 02:16:21,780
I know you can't blame anyone for trying. All right. I, you know what? And even if you can't

1247
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:28,340
afford, I cannot stress this enough. Y'all being here is donation enough for me. And especially

1248
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:32,980
those of you that spread the word on social media and that sort of thing. I see that and just thank

1249
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:40,900
you for all of that. I mean, the money's nice too, but I just want to be clear. All right. Anyway,

1250
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:46,260
let's move on. I'm sorry, Ram. I interrupted a thought of yours while

1251
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:47,860
Quite all right.

1252
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:55,540
And I'll admit I was one of those. I was kind of pissed. I had to pay for autographs because I was,

1253
02:16:55,540 --> 02:17:01,780
it's not because I was entitled. It's what I'm used to is to animate culture, but you have to

1254
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:06,900
learn to adapt and move on. Yes. It kind of sucks. You have to pay for an autograph,

1255
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:12,580
but you know what that means? That means the voice actor will end up getting a lower

1256
02:17:13,460 --> 02:17:19,140
one-time cost for period con appearance, but they able to make more money on the autographs,

1257
02:17:19,140 --> 02:17:27,700
which allows the con to get more guests. That's true. That is true because, um, guests have to

1258
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:33,300
have that minimum guarantee of how much they sell and a con can't get a big name guest that

1259
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:38,500
they can't guarantee that they're going to allow that. Because if the celeb doesn't make that money,

1260
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:43,700
the con has to reimburse them basically like, sorry, you came out here and didn't get your

1261
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:48,260
multi-thousand dollar minimum, depending on who it is, it can be a multi-thousand dollar minimum.

1262
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:52,900
So yeah, anyway, not to do too much inside baseball, but it's just one of those things

1263
02:17:52,900 --> 02:18:02,660
where it's like, if you, you know, again, if you think Helena Taylor was being underpaid at 20,000

1264
02:18:02,660 --> 02:18:06,260
or whatever it was they offered her to do Bayonetta, then fucking don't complain when

1265
02:18:06,260 --> 02:18:11,780
she charges you 40 bucks for a selfie. You're giving her the money you believe she's entitled to.

1266
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:19,860
Rob, at this point, the hell with insider baseball, the people need to know. It's gotten to that

1267
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:26,100
point. Yeah. It's got, let's go back to the, uh, the height of the pandemic. You had to open up

1268
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:30,180
the books and tell people, this is why the concept happened. This is why this is not happening.

1269
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:36,580
It's becoming public knowledge and people need to know there are more people, more voice actors

1270
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:42,740
talking about, they're not getting paid enough. You know, I know voice actors who are Twitch

1271
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:47,700
streaming, YouTube streaming. I mean, because in a way, because of the pandemic, we got more

1272
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:52,020
critical role and that was started by Matt Mercer and a bunch of other voice actors.

1273
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:55,860
Can I say as a quick aside, I owe you 75 cents because I've used the term

1274
02:18:55,860 --> 02:18:58,820
pandemic three times this week. So I now owe you three quarters.

1275
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:03,940
Actually, you don't owe me three quarters. Those, those three quarters want to my best friends,

1276
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:07,700
Patty and Steph. Okay. Two of the most ladies ever.

1277
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:10,980
I miss Patty love Patty. I have, I met Steph.

1278
02:19:11,780 --> 02:19:16,020
Oh no, this is a different Patty and Steph. Oh, okay. Oh, I thought it was okay. Well,

1279
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:21,060
I'm still going to declare my love for Patty. Okay. So I just, I did that one's on the house.

1280
02:19:23,060 --> 02:19:27,380
I'm sure other Patty and Steph, I would love to any, any friend of Rama's a friend of mine.

1281
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:30,900
Well, they are the ones that made the glow in the dark fog patches.

1282
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:37,940
Oh, okay. Then I do like them. Yes. Jamie knows Patty and Steph because they,

1283
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:40,740
they do Debbie delight together. Sometimes if I'm not mistaken.

1284
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:48,340
I, yeah, I'm starlet. I know them starlet creation.

1285
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:54,260
They're absolutely delightful people. We haven't actually got, no, we, I did with starlight too,

1286
02:19:54,260 --> 02:20:00,100
which I don't sure which of them that is, but we did play, um, a little bit of Debbie together is

1287
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:07,140
actually, no, it fell apart, but we tried to, but delightful people and, and regulars in my stream.

1288
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:11,380
Yeah, for sure. And anyway, sorry, back to the, back to the topic of hands. Sorry,

1289
02:20:11,380 --> 02:20:16,340
we didn't know it's cool, but I'll always give a shout out to great people. But, um, the, uh,

1290
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:19,780
you know, we were talking a little bit last week, we were reflecting on Twitch con, which was two

1291
02:20:19,780 --> 02:20:23,780
weeks ago. Right. And we were reflecting on the drag show, which was, you know, really a highlight

1292
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:29,460
of Twitch con for, especially those of us in the LGBTQ plus community, you know, is very, um,

1293
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:35,220
very, uh, great for us. And the fact that they were highlighting performers who didn't make

1294
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:40,420
their careers off of drag race or what have you. And again, again, I have nothing but love in my

1295
02:20:40,420 --> 02:20:45,220
heart for those people, but I love that they spotlight people that again, we're not able to

1296
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:51,620
perform in local clubs. And so they turned to Twitch to, you know, get that income that they

1297
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:57,060
were missing from doing the club stuff and really built up a international following on a place like

1298
02:20:57,060 --> 02:21:02,420
Twitch. So, yeah, I mean, during the pandemic, a lot of, you know, voice actors and people that

1299
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:06,820
were, you know, out jobs and so forth, we're, we're turning to Twitch to do that. And that's

1300
02:21:06,820 --> 02:21:12,740
why Twitch has really exploded, you know, in the last few years. So. Yep. Yep. All right. Anyway,

1301
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:16,420
Rama, I gotta let you go. Cause we have one more caller waiting, but, um, any other thoughts before

1302
02:21:16,420 --> 02:21:24,180
we let you go? Pay people for what they're worth. And if you have, and if you don't feel your worth

1303
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:29,300
is being paid, there are other ways of handling the situation with tact and respect. And another

1304
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:33,460
way I might phrase that pay people what they're worth, but pay me first. I'm just kidding.

1305
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:43,540
Just kidding. Girl. And that's all I have to say about that. You all take care of yourselves and

1306
02:21:43,540 --> 02:21:48,340
each other. It's always a delight to hear from you. Uh, I hope it's not too cold there. You're

1307
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:53,780
wearing a jacket indoors. It must be very cold there. Something like that. It's like basically,

1308
02:21:54,580 --> 02:22:01,060
you know how there's four seasons in New York city, there's about 12 and fall just went to

1309
02:22:01,060 --> 02:22:04,740
hell with you. I'm out and winter's like, yo, what's good. And I'm just like,

1310
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:10,020
Rama, you ever want to come to California for an extended visit? Look at that nice comfy couch.

1311
02:22:10,020 --> 02:22:13,620
Look at that nice comfy couch behind me here on the, the, uh, voice keys network.

1312
02:22:13,620 --> 02:22:19,220
I have, I have a full on height of bed. Uh, wait, that couch used to be mine.

1313
02:22:19,940 --> 02:22:26,660
I don't know. I don't know if I've mentioned this, but my job gives us mandatory three

1314
02:22:26,660 --> 02:22:32,660
weeks paid vacation and two weeks out of the year at the end of the year, the office is closed.

1315
02:22:32,660 --> 02:22:36,100
I've kind of canceled plans to go to Florida. So anything's plausible.

1316
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:40,740
Come visit. We'll do, we'll do, we'll go do something fun.

1317
02:22:41,860 --> 02:22:44,500
I'll take you to a gay bar. We'll have the best time. I assure you.

1318
02:22:45,380 --> 02:22:48,820
But I want you to know it's been at least three,

1319
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:52,180
four years since I've been to a gay bar. We'll take you to the Depot.

1320
02:22:53,140 --> 02:22:57,940
We will drive down and say hello to Victoria. Yes.

1321
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:04,980
That's what I'm talking about right there. And then we'll go to see Victoria,

1322
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:09,780
but I had stuff to do. All right. Now we really have to let you go to get to this other cause

1323
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:12,900
now we're talking about people that the listeners are like, who the fuck are these people? All right,

1324
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:20,420
have a good one. My friend. All right, let's get to another call. We're going to bring someone

1325
02:23:20,420 --> 02:23:23,620
else in here real quick. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1326
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:25,540
Hello, Shane.

1327
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:28,340
Shane. It's been a while since we've heard from you. How are you?

1328
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:30,660
I'm fine.

1329
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:32,100
All right. Uh, what's on your mind tonight?

1330
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:39,460
Pokemon as usual. I mean, of course now in all fairness, I talked about Pokemon earlier in the

1331
02:23:39,460 --> 02:23:43,940
show. So if you're, if you're here to yell at me for not bringing up Pokemon, uh, you should have

1332
02:23:43,940 --> 02:23:49,780
been here earlier. Uh, no, it doesn't matter when you talk about it's when I talk about it,

1333
02:23:49,780 --> 02:23:53,940
that counts. All right. How are we feeling about gen nine, Shane?

1334
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:58,500
Oh, so excited. So excited. So they did, uh, I mean, I don't know what you talked about,

1335
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:03,380
so I'm like, I just briefly mentioned the media tour this week for influencers and stuff that they

1336
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:07,460
were showing the first hour of the game or whatever it is. Oh, it's not even the first

1337
02:24:07,460 --> 02:24:12,420
hour. They just got to play an hour. It kind of threw them in randomly. But, um,

1338
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:18,740
the thing I want to talk about, the most important thing is the music. Well, it's not the most

1339
02:24:18,740 --> 02:24:23,060
important thing, but it's the most important thing really to come out of this like influencer media

1340
02:24:23,060 --> 02:24:29,380
tour. And I sent you a link so you could play the little clip that, uh, is awesome.

1341
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:33,940
I can, but the problem is, um, dark soccer and Loki and yourself won't be able to hear it. Just

1342
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:35,780
the listeners will be able to hear it when I do that.

1343
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:39,460
Oh, well, all right. Everybody should still hear it.

1344
02:24:39,460 --> 02:24:42,980
All right. Well, forgive me for a moment. Cause I just need to change the shot real quick. Cause

1345
02:24:42,980 --> 02:24:46,500
I'm going to open a private discord screen. So I don't want to show, cause I don't know,

1346
02:24:46,500 --> 02:24:49,460
Lord knows what else we've been talking about in there. So let me just pull this up real,

1347
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:57,460
uh, real quick. Um, and then I can, oops. Well, I guess we were talking about PT. Weren't we,

1348
02:24:57,460 --> 02:25:01,540
um, hold on. Let me try that again. Way to make that private.

1349
02:25:01,780 --> 02:25:08,100
Yeah. After going through all that. And I love that. What a shock after, after all that, it's

1350
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:11,940
like, Oh, the, the secret conversation, Robin Shay, we're having, we're about PT. All right.

1351
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:16,900
Let's see. All right. So I'm going to play this. Hold on. Let me, uh,

1352
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:22,180
so this is music that we need to hear this battle wild Pokemon music. And I have never

1353
02:25:22,180 --> 02:25:28,260
heard this before, by the way. Yes. So wait, I'll set it up. So it's the music that plays

1354
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:34,820
when you run into a Pokemon in the wild and it doesn't sound like Pokemon music there. That's

1355
02:25:34,820 --> 02:25:39,540
my, that's my setup. Okay. Let me, uh, I'm going to check out a little bit with apologies to dark

1356
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:43,300
soccer and Loki. Cause we don't have that. It's like 10 seconds. It's nothing.

1357
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:55,620
Are we going to get copyright strike? Cause I'm playing this music. I need to talk over it. Don't

1358
02:25:56,260 --> 02:25:59,140
I? Um, Oh God, these Pokemon are so cute though.

1359
02:26:01,380 --> 02:26:05,940
That's I mean, it's a good song, but I'm not sitting here going like, Oh my God,

1360
02:26:05,940 --> 02:26:08,820
is this, is this a song I need to hear? That's kind of like the funky little.

1361
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:16,420
Yeah. So this is nothing like how it's, it's like jazzy persona five-y sort of like,

1362
02:26:16,420 --> 02:26:18,340
okay. I see what you mean. I see what you mean.

1363
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:22,180
Yeah. No, it's amazing. It's absolutely amazing.

1364
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:26,420
It's nowhere near the level of the gym battle song in the last game. That's,

1365
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:31,300
that was, that was S tier music. That was S tier music for Pokemon was the gym.

1366
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:37,060
No, it was. You're right. And this is like S plus. Um, and same with like,

1367
02:26:37,060 --> 02:26:45,540
I own those theme is really good too. I just like having many games with the same sort of,

1368
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:50,820
with the exception of like, you know, the gym music from last gen, like very similar sounding

1369
02:26:52,180 --> 02:26:58,420
I don't know, everything in the game. It's just, it's really refreshing that they, they put like

1370
02:26:58,420 --> 02:27:03,620
a really good piece of music that kind of bucks the trend as something you're going to hear quite

1371
02:27:03,620 --> 02:27:10,180
often. And it's just, it's so good. It's going to make that thousand plus hours I'm going to spend

1372
02:27:10,180 --> 02:27:14,660
in each game. Like probably not as monotonous as it could have been.

1373
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:22,500
Okay, but what song is better that song? Or I was waiting to see if you'd even let me say the

1374
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:27,300
alternative before you just say that song. Okay, what song is better that song or close in the

1375
02:27:27,300 --> 02:27:35,220
distance from home as he for 14? They're not even like, you can't compare that. That's like

1376
02:27:35,220 --> 02:27:44,180
comparing. It's like comparing Del Taco to a flame and y'all. It's like, they're both really good in

1377
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:51,620
their own ways. But like, you just can't because I don't always want a filet mignon. Sometimes I need

1378
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:56,100
like a crunchy. Sometimes you want you sometimes you want a taco and crinkle fries. I understand.

1379
02:27:56,100 --> 02:28:03,300
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I don't know this. Like, I didn't really expect previews to drop this week.

1380
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:08,260
It looks amazing. Everybody that played it. I guess there were some like technical issues,

1381
02:28:08,260 --> 02:28:14,340
but it's a Pokemon game. What do you expect? But people just were like, genuinely happy. And

1382
02:28:14,340 --> 02:28:18,740
a lot of the things that they couldn't talk about made them very happy, which annoys the crap out of

1383
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:24,740
me. But whatever. It's fine. I understand. I understand playing a game you really enjoy,

1384
02:28:24,740 --> 02:28:27,940
and you really want to talk about it, but you can't. I understand that very well this week.

1385
02:28:27,940 --> 02:28:35,700
Yes. But I was gonna say the icon on your Discord is Quaxley, one of the starter Pokemon,

1386
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:40,660
but we still don't know what Quaxley's final form looks like. And how nervous are you on a scale

1387
02:28:40,660 --> 02:28:49,220
one to 10? 40 billion. Like, I don't want to get screwed over like I did with Popplio. And I just

1388
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:56,340
feel like I'm going to. And I don't really have a true backup yet. Like, at least with Popplio,

1389
02:28:56,340 --> 02:29:02,740
Rowlet was great. Like, Decidueye is awesome. But I mean, from the leaked stuff that I won't

1390
02:29:02,740 --> 02:29:08,740
talk about, I don't really know what I'm gonna do. Okay. What's your dream? Like,

1391
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:13,620
if you got to design Quaxley's third form, what would what would the dream evolution look like

1392
02:29:13,620 --> 02:29:22,820
for you? Um, I say punk rock doc duck. Dog. He just gets from duck to dog. It's clearly

1393
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:29,860
going to be a fighting type humanoid duck. I mean, that's, that's obviously the perfect choice.

1394
02:29:29,860 --> 02:29:35,300
It would look like Donald Duck, but with a fatter ass. I have seen a lot of Howard,

1395
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:39,540
the duck Howard, the duck is the No, because that scared me as a kid. I can't have that.

1396
02:29:41,380 --> 02:29:46,740
No, I I've seen a lot of fan art, like speculation on what it could be. And I've seen a lot of really

1397
02:29:46,740 --> 02:29:54,740
good matador designs. And I like that. I think if you're going to stick with like the Spain

1398
02:29:54,740 --> 02:30:00,500
influence, I think that would be really cool. Okay, I like that. That would be pretty cool.

1399
02:30:00,500 --> 02:30:08,260
So yeah. All right. A malador because mallard matador doing something like that,

1400
02:30:08,260 --> 02:30:15,780
or a pirate named like swash duckler. You just came up with that a malador like you

1401
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:20,020
could literally work at Pokemon making Pokemon with talent like that. That's really good. I

1402
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:25,540
like way better than the job I'm doing now. So I'm bored. I'll make pun names all day long.

1403
02:30:29,860 --> 02:30:33,140
Oh, that's so good. I can't wait for this and Silent Hill. Even if you crapped on it,

1404
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:37,060
it still looks I didn't crap on it. We talked to actually pretty positively about it. What

1405
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:42,340
do you what do you do? What are you lying about? I was in the bath. I don't know. I'm just gonna

1406
02:30:42,340 --> 02:30:47,060
say what I assume happened. You know what they say about people that assume

1407
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:52,660
I'm about to set the record gay right now. Uh, Shane, is the new James hot or not?

1408
02:30:54,180 --> 02:30:59,460
Depends on the like scene now. Now who's backtracking now who's backtracking?

1409
02:30:59,460 --> 02:31:08,020
I never I never agreed with you fully. Like, I just said I showed you his Instagram. And I said

1410
02:31:08,020 --> 02:31:14,260
that sometimes he has wonky hair. And there's a couple times where his face is a little strange,

1411
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:19,700
but sometimes it looks fine. So it's okay. And they still have time to fix it because we don't

1412
02:31:19,700 --> 02:31:25,940
have a release year even. So that's true. That's true, too. Yeah. And that and man,

1413
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:31,140
this week was good for horror games and resonable for remake, which I've never played, but I somehow

1414
02:31:31,140 --> 02:31:37,540
pre ordered the collector's edition. I don't know what happened there. Um, it's it's very exciting,

1415
02:31:37,540 --> 02:31:46,100
like, three, four ish Silent Hills. Yeah. Dog. Oh, do you think it's a misdirect?

1416
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:51,620
I hope it is. But also, I didn't even know that was a thing until I saw a clip about it. I was

1417
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:55,860
like, I would have gone in ignorant and like, Oh, just part of the scenery. I didn't know that.

1418
02:31:56,420 --> 02:32:01,620
In the original one, he was somebody you could help. And so I better be able to help him or like

1419
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:04,660
parry something with my gun. Like, I don't know, ever killed him.

1420
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:09,300
Rocket. Oh, my God. Something just occurred to me. We talked about Silent Hill. And now we're

1421
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:15,620
talking about this dog. What if in the movie, we find a random Shiba Inu running around?

1422
02:32:16,420 --> 02:32:21,940
That that would be the dog ending after credits. That would be the best post credit like like

1423
02:32:21,940 --> 02:32:24,980
Marvel could never with a post credit sequence that good.

1424
02:32:26,660 --> 02:32:33,060
I nominate my Shiba Inu puppy. Although there there is I did not watch the entire 90 minute

1425
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:37,540
presentation. But apparently there was merchandising, merchandising. And apparently

1426
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:44,660
there is a like dog ending like, like, whole setup you can actually buy. And so I was like,

1427
02:32:44,660 --> 02:32:47,380
Okay, that is pretty cute. Did you already pre order it?

1428
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:49,060
No, no.

1429
02:32:50,420 --> 02:32:51,460
Because I need this.

1430
02:32:51,460 --> 02:32:53,380
Yes. Somebody find the link, please. And drop it.

1431
02:32:54,500 --> 02:32:57,700
I'll be honest, I did not see it up for pre order yet because I did go to their

1432
02:32:58,340 --> 02:33:06,900
site shortly after the transmission ended. And I saw, like the stuffed animal Shiba Inu.

1433
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:10,500
And I did not see I think they said it was a coin bank. I did not see that.

1434
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:12,980
As Joe and Matt says it isn't the discord somewhere. So yeah,

1435
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:18,340
actually, since we brought up Silent Hill, let me ask you real quick about that. Because I know

1436
02:33:18,340 --> 02:33:22,260
you're you love Silent Hill. And you know, you brought a lot of those games to my attention, too.

1437
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:28,340
Um, I'm curious your thoughts on Silent Hill F and the kind of very different direction they

1438
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:29,300
appear to be going with that.

1439
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:38,180
It's hard to say because they, I mean, all they did was show a little CG with no context,

1440
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:44,420
except we do know it's it's set in Japan, and it's set in the 1960s. Yeah. So I mean,

1441
02:33:44,420 --> 02:33:48,660
they can literally do anything I was talking with one of my friends about this, who was like,

1442
02:33:48,660 --> 02:33:54,180
Oh, but it has to be in Silent Hill to be a Silent Hill. Like, four wasn't in Silent Hill

1443
02:33:54,180 --> 02:33:59,460
or was in Ashfield. Like, you just need somebody with a connection there. And who's to say there's

1444
02:33:59,460 --> 02:34:06,980
no connection, like somebody visited? Or I've seen people say like, the white Claudia flower comes

1445
02:34:06,980 --> 02:34:11,460
from this maybe. So there's like, a lot of different ways you could connect it and it's

1446
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:15,700
still fine. I feel like it's gonna tie into the lore somehow, ultimately, but I like the look and

1447
02:34:15,700 --> 02:34:20,420
the aesthetic they're going for, even though yes, we didn't see one actual frame of game. So yeah,

1448
02:34:20,420 --> 02:34:25,620
and whatever the developer, the only frame of reference I have for them is Resident Evil

1449
02:34:25,620 --> 02:34:33,060
reverse. So I'm a little concerned. But then I mean, I could say the same for Bloomberg team,

1450
02:34:33,060 --> 02:34:37,380
or I could, I don't know the other two studio. Oh, wait, one's dead by daylight. And then the other

1451
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:41,860
is, well, it's like four different studios behaviors, just one of them. So yeah, that's

1452
02:34:41,860 --> 02:34:46,180
true. But I really quickly want to say thank you as you 100 Matt actually dropped the link in chat

1453
02:34:46,180 --> 02:34:53,540
to the coin bank. So it's Silent Hill to Enu. And I guess is the official name of that ending coin

1454
02:34:53,540 --> 02:34:59,940
back bank statue. So but the price is TBD, it is going to come out 2023 in Japan, but it does say

1455
02:34:59,940 --> 02:35:05,620
other areas TBD. So they're planning to release at least in other areas. So that's pretty cool.

1456
02:35:05,620 --> 02:35:10,100
But yeah, it was tweeted out with most important Silent Hill announcement and, you know,

1457
02:35:10,100 --> 02:35:16,580
understandable relatable. That's just like the the pyramid. They showed at the beginning of

1458
02:35:16,580 --> 02:35:21,300
this merchandise thing is really amazing. But it's like, here's all the Japanese information.

1459
02:35:21,300 --> 02:35:27,060
It may come somewhere else. But maybe Oh, no, yet. I'm like, man, I would love that.

1460
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:32,820
I need this. I know I kind of wanted to anyway, I'm Shane, we're about at the end of showtime. So

1461
02:35:32,820 --> 02:35:38,020
do you have any other final thoughts for us before we let you go? No. Okay, well, then,

1462
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:46,820
bye. Bye. All right. Thank you, Shane, as always, for coming on the show. Let's wrap it all up here

1469
02:36:14,660 --> 02:36:18,580
everybody's final thoughts and wrap it all up. So DarkSakura, I'll let you go first because I

1470
02:36:18,580 --> 02:36:24,020
know you're streaming some Debbie tonight. Don't forget the momathon on November 1st.

1471
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:31,220
Help me help out my mom. Same name, DarkSakura underscore O-L-R. You're on Twitch. I really

1472
02:36:31,220 --> 02:36:34,980
appreciate any help you can help me with my mom. You're also very smart to do that on what is

1473
02:36:34,980 --> 02:36:42,340
payday for a lot of people. Well, I picked a day that I was off work. Fair enough. All right.

1474
02:36:42,340 --> 02:36:47,220
Later taters. Bye DarkSakura. Have a good one. All right. Loki, your final thoughts for us tonight.

1475
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:53,380
Trees are hard to make. What's hard to make? Trees. Oh, trees are hard to make. You have

1476
02:36:53,380 --> 02:36:58,500
to wait a long time for them to grow. Especially cyber trees. They are very hard to design.

1477
02:36:59,300 --> 02:37:04,820
Uh, my final thought is, uh, next week is Halloween weekend. I hope you all have a fun

1478
02:37:04,820 --> 02:37:08,260
because let's be real. Halloween is on a Monday. So most of you are going to do your, you know,

1479
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:12,660
spooky shit on a Saturday. So I hope you all have fun. I will be hosting a now sold out

1480
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:16,580
performance of Rocky Horror Picture Show here in Sacramento. I'm very excited about it. Uh,

1481
02:37:16,580 --> 02:37:21,940
and I hope whatever you all are doing for your spooky Saturday day, I hope you all have fun.

1482
02:37:21,940 --> 02:37:26,740
Be safe. Uh, make good choices. If you make bad ones, at least know the risks.

1483
02:37:27,300 --> 02:37:31,540
Uh, that's it for us tonight here at Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you all so much for watching

1484
02:37:31,540 --> 02:37:37,780
the show. Um, have a great week and we will see you next time to talk about, uh, all the

1485
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:41,300
late breaking news. Uh, I'm sure again, cause it's been a lot of that in October. It's been

1486
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:44,900
late breaking news, October. So have a good one everybody. We'll see you in seven days.

1487
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:46,100
Have a wonderful week. Good night.
