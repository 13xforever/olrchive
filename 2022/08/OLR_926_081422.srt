1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,700
It's pronounced Koch Media.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,300
This week, we have a headline about Sunsoft announcing that they'll announce news this

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,300
week!

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,400
Seriously, that's the whole article.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,400
They included a single quote from the press release and the About Sunsoft block, and that's

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
it.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
Yeah.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,240
This is just one headline before the headline.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,400
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,080
their favorite memories of Sunsoft and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,080
now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,960
Jason, it's what we call a slow news week.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,040
Oh, hello, my friends out there on the internet.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,280
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,660
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:57,080
We are live with you once again for episode number 926 of our show for August the 14th

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,760
of 2022.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,720
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined by my co-hosts.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,080
First off, showing off her merch and the hook of shame.

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,960
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,440
I was actually just stretching.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,280
Oh, I thought you were doing a product placement.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Well, how about that?

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,520
How do you like my Pikachu I've got on my shirt here?

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,680
Not my merch, though.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,960
I think Nintendo would shut me down immediately if I try, or a Pokemon company, if I tried

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
to do a Pikachu shirt.

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,080
Although I'm pretty sure I might be leaving my current merch location, so we'll see.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
You know what?

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,800
We still have to set up a new VOG store.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,480
We kind of never really got around to that once we closed the old one, so lots to look

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
forward to.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,040
There's another one that Elsie uses that I'm going to ask about that apparently they don't

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
have as big of a selection, but they've got really good material.

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,200
Okay, I'm all for like material and solid shirt, because you remember back in the day,

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
and I'm not even sure if this company is still around.

37
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,360
Was it Cafe-E-Press or Cafe-Press or something?

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,120
It was called Cafe-Press, and they're still around.

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Oh, are they still around?

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Sorry.

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,480
Now, disclaimer, I haven't used this site in like 10 years, but I just remember it was

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,000
the first site that everybody would print their own shirts on, and it was a big printing

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,240
on demand industry.

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Those shirts were terrible, because the logos would rub off the first time you washed the

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
shirt.

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
They did not last.

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm a fan of Redbubble.

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,000
They have the ringer shirts now, and I think that that's really cool.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,800
I'm looking at Cafe-Press right now, and they have bumper stickers and different things,

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,040
so I might look into that.

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,440
Also joining us, Techmaster Loki, who's dying to say something here, what?

52
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,880
Don't go to Redbubble.

53
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:51,680
Their quality is very inconsistent, seriously, because our group, them with Channel 64, we

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,560
were looking at doing merchandise, and Redbubble was one of the places that we looked at, and

55
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,720
we ordered several shirts from them.

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,540
Some were okay, some were terrible, and it was just inconsistent.

57
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,240
The printing was offset.

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,280
It wasn't just ... It was very inconsistent.

59
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
It's a bummer.

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
And not great.

61
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,240
It's a bummer, because I actually like the quality of the shirts on the store we were

62
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,920
at before, before everything went 180 over there, so it's unfortunate.

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,200
Also, well, I use StreamElements when I stream, and I might check out their merch store.

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,320
I'm looking around for reviews and stuff like that, so we'll see.

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,760
Well, hey, you know what-

66
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
Oh, we use StreamLabs, that's right.

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Once in a while, we get spammed with t-shirt stores, and usually I just kind of let them go,

68
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
because I'm like, eh, they email all the podcasts.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,400
But you know what?

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:48,320
If you want t-shirt shops, if you spam us this week and use the secret word ... What's

71
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,400
the secret word?

72
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,280
The secret word is rainbow, okay?

73
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,920
If you use the secret-

74
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,800
I don't know.

75
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,040
If you use the secret word rainbow in your email, then I'll know it's not a spam email.

76
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,880
So if you have a t-shirt store offer, send that over.

77
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,360
All right.

78
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh, Jason suggested cookies.

79
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,920
Okay, rainbow cookies, then I'll read every word.

80
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,800
I just found something terrible out.

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,720
What's that?

82
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,560
That game that you were talking about on Bobby's show is on Mac.

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Oh, I'm going to be talking about it here tonight in a minute.

84
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,720
Stay tuned for our gaming weeks.

85
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:37,040
But first, let's get into the kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with a game that's

86
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,160
coming out soon that I think a lot of people are looking forward to.

87
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,880
I know I am, and it's Splatoon 3, and there was a direct for Splatoon 3 this week, and

88
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,200
kind of culminated with the announcement of a Splatfest world premiere multiplayer

89
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,120
demo on August 27th.

90
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,640
There was a 30-minute Splatoon 3 direct video presentation.

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,680
I'm going to be honest.

92
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,120
I did not watch the whole thing.

93
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,640
I skimmed it because those things come out too early in the day for me to watch the whole

94
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:02,800
thing.

95
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,760
I have to work and stuff.

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,440
But I took a look at the highlights, and they kind of went over like, these are the

97
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,360
characters that are going to be in the story.

98
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,200
This is what the turf war is all about.

99
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,640
Salmon Run is coming back.

100
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,240
Here's some new stages.

101
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,760
But what I thought was interesting is that this new Splatfests are going to be three.

102
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,640
So you know how everything before was two.

103
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,880
It was like, Ketchup and Mayonnaise was one of them.

104
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, as if there was any question which team I was on with that.

105
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,320
The Ketchup and Mayonnaise was one of them.

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,360
Oh, I'm trying to think of some of the other...

107
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
Did they ever do over the roll or under the roll?

108
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
I don't know if Splatoon ever did that.

109
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
No, because they know that there's only one answer to that.

110
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,480
There is no debate.

111
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,680
But that or it's a hot dog, a sandwich.

112
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,440
You know, those are the types of things that they would do in...

113
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,480
Oh, Dark Tetsuya says that over under was actually a UK one, he thinks.

114
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,920
I wouldn't be surprised, but it would be too controversial here.

115
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,520
But anyway, the big twist is now they're three choices.

116
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,720
So they're three teams because it's Splatoon 3, right?

117
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,360
So the preview Splatfest is going to be Team Rock, Paper or Scissors.

118
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,200
That's a hard one.

119
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,360
I'm thinking I'm going to go with Team Scissors because, you know, we'll cut you.

120
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,960
But I don't know.

121
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,920
I could also see like Team Paper is going to write a bunch of shit about you.

122
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,400
Team Rock, Rocks.

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,720
I don't know.

124
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,680
They're going to throw themselves at you.

125
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,560
But Team Rock doesn't live in a glass house.

126
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,120
You know, I don't know like what types of things.

127
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,000
But, you know, people are going to get creative with those little banners that they're going

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,360
to draw and that's the whole thing.

129
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,880
But I thought that that meant, oh, then that means all these PVPs are going to be like

130
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,400
three team maps now.

131
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,880
That would be really cool because like Final Fantasy XIV's PVP has some of that and it

132
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,560
lets you do some different stuff.

133
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
But it's not really like that.

134
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,840
So what happens is that in the first half of the Splatfest, it's still 4v4 turf war

135
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,080
battles, but the second half now that's a tricolor turf war and the three teams all

136
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,680
fight at the same time.

137
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,560
But the first place team does a four in the center and the second and third place team

138
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,480
do two and two in a pincher attack.

139
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,120
So that's kind of interesting.

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,200
So there is like tricolor matches.

141
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,840
And I actually think that's kind of an interesting little twist on the formula is just why does

142
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,960
it have to be just two teams?

143
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,880
Why not three teams full of color?

144
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,400
So I think that's going to be very interesting.

145
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,640
That alone made me very interested in like, OK, that's kind of a very simple, but like

146
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,560
it's going to it's going to lead to some new things.

147
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,480
So, yeah, I'm excited to see kind of where that goes.

148
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,720
They also are talking about new weapons.

149
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,000
So there's a new bow, the tri stringer that can fire in three directions at once.

150
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,320
There's a splatana wiper.

151
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,120
So like not a katana, but a splatana where you throw ink basically by swinging the katana.

152
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,160
Look, it's a video game.

153
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,800
Don't try to put like actual physics and logic into it.

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,440
It's how it works.

155
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,400
And special weapons that you get after inking enough turf, including the tecta cooler where

156
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,280
a fridge appears with stat boosting beverages.

157
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,080
That's kind of fun.

158
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,400
And I'm surprised they didn't try to do like a tie in with an actual drink there, a wave

159
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,480
breaker for waves and so on and so on.

160
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,960
It just sounds like it's going to be really neat.

161
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,720
The lobby's back.

162
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,120
Your friends appear as 3D holograms.

163
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,200
You can join us an alley or drop out as an opponent.

164
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
You know, whatever you need to do there.

165
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,880
So it's just it's neat.

166
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
And there's new amiibo coming.

167
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,240
The yellow inkling, the blue octoling and a small fry will be there for fifteen ninety

168
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,200
nine each.

169
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
And if you scan the amiibo, you get to save gear combinations.

170
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,360
And some amiibo, of course, have exclusive gear because they've got to convince you to

171
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
keep buying all that stuff somehow.

172
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,800
Also, one more thing.

173
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,400
I mean, it was a 30 minute presentation after all at PAX West, which used to be PAX Prime,

174
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,920
but now it's just PAX West because, you know, there's PAX East, PAX South.

175
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,560
So PAX West on September 5th, the top players from the Splatoon 2 Inkopolis showdown will

176
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,680
go to Seattle to complete in the first ever Splatoon 3 Invitational.

177
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,160
I think that's kind of interesting because it just shows, again, Nintendo kind of just

178
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,960
slithering a little more into that e-sports realm that I feel in part they've been very

179
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,720
resistant to for a long time.

180
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,480
But then, of course, we heard the news about what's that company, Panda, that they started

181
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,680
teaming up with for the Super Smash Brothers official tournaments and all that stuff.

182
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,680
So it's just it's just interesting to see Nintendo start to kind of go down that road

183
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,680
a little more, even though they really should have got on board with e-sports some time

184
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,000
ago.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,560
But, you know, better late than pregnant, I guess.

186
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,400
So there's that.

187
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,560
So I got that one.

188
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,200
Dark Soccer.

189
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,320
Just Dark Soccer.

190
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,880
I count on you to always catch a Golden Girls reference.

191
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,040
All right.

192
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,360
Anyway, Loki, what did you think?

193
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Jamie, I don't know if you have thoughts, but either thoughts on Splatoon 3?

194
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,760
I didn't watch it.

195
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,640
I didn't play the second one.

196
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,280
Like, I didn't really play the second one too much.

197
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,640
I remember getting it, but like, I don't think I ever played it.

198
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,240
Well, the weird.

199
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,560
OK, so what was funny, I will say this.

200
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,600
When I was at Target the other day, I was talking to Alan about Splatoon 3.

201
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,320
I was like, oh, yeah, Splatoon 3 is like the next big release on the Switch.

202
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,040
It's coming.

203
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,160
And he cracked a joke.

204
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,000
He said, oh, is that another one for them to support for six months before they pull

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
the plug on it?

206
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,680
And I was like, oh, wig.

207
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,120
OK, like, we're here to read today because that is kind of what happened with Splatoon

208
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,520
2 is that it wasn't supported quite as long as you would have thought, especially when

209
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,480
you put it side by side with Mario Kart 8 right now.

210
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,280
OK, so now granted, you know, the team went on to make Splatoon 3 and maybe they're just,

211
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,680
you know, making the fully realized game there.

212
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,720
But it is a decent read that like Splatoon 2 kind of came and went as far as the support

213
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,220
goes.

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,880
And Mike Dev said Splatoon 2 had two years of support, if I recall correctly.

215
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,440
Fair enough.

216
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,280
But it didn't seem like it was as long as number one, that's for sure.

217
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,680
I don't know.

218
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,400
It seemed like those flat fests didn't hang out quite as long.

219
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,760
But, you know, perception is everything, whether it's the truth or not.

220
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,000
Right.

221
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's how it goes in the video game industry.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,440
So, yeah.

223
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,280
I'll be perfectly honest right now.

224
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,200
Dead by Daylight takes enough of my time.

225
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,240
Well, you know, and that's for any kind of online multiplayer versus situation.

226
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,680
Well, and that's like the ever going conundrum in gaming right now in general is that games

227
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,560
as a service, which I would say in some ways Dead by Daylight is, because the constant

228
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,360
DLC support, the constant patches, the battle passes, it's games as a service, right?

229
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,600
Yeah.

230
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,840
Never say behavior hasn't kept up with their product.

231
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,680
But you could throw into that same bin things like Overwatch, Fortnite, Call of Duty, hell,

232
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
anything with a battle pass really fits in that system.

233
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,680
But because we invest so much time now in these games as a service, and I would say

234
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,040
I'm just as guilty, not just Dead by Daylight, but like Final Fantasy 14, MMOs, the original

235
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
game as a service, right?

236
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,920
Like those games take so much of our time, that's what allows our backlogs to build up

237
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,400
because we're so focused on staying on the cutting edge of, you know, whatever's being

238
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,840
released in the battle pass and whatever our number one, our main game is.

239
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,040
So it's just interesting.

240
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,840
I feel like maybe it's Dead by Daylight for you, but a lot of people have this problem

241
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,760
with some game out there.

242
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,000
For Loki, it's Minecraft, you know?

243
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,600
For me, it's Final Fantasy and a little bit of everything.

244
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,320
So, and Bobby Blackwolf says, yeah, that's one of the reasons I did let my Final Fantasy

245
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,840
14 sub lapse.

246
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,800
And yeah, I have to force myself to play other games sometimes.

247
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,600
Luckily, 14 is in a bit of a content lull right now because we're between patches.

248
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,080
And the 14 team does a very good job staying on top of patches.

249
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,400
So like they're not as bad as, wow.

250
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,720
But, you know, we're still about two weeks out from the next Final Fantasy 14 patch.

251
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,240
So I still have a good two weeks to get in, you know, a bunch of other games.

252
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,920
But once that Final Fantasy 14 patch comes out, that's going to take over my gaming week

253
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,040
for at least a month while I explore everything in that patch.

254
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,760
And with that island sanctuary coming, they're putting like farm simulator into, I don't

255
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,680
know if it's Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon.

256
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,880
I don't know which one of those they're going for in Final Fantasy, but they're putting

257
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,400
one of those in that game.

258
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,200
And that's going to be a time sink for sure.

259
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,560
It's all of them.

260
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,320
Yeah, so let's see.

261
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,520
And Mike Deft bring in the receipts saying Splatoon, excuse me, Nintendo released Splatoon

262
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,480
2's final significant update version 5.0 in July 2019.

263
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,640
The update signaled the end of the game's post launch support, which continued for two

264
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,040
years since the Switch shooters initial release.

265
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Well, I guess it did get longer support than most EA games.

266
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
So let's give them a round of applause for that.

267
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,080
You know, at least there is that.

268
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:46,560
But again, it's still hard to look at Splatoon 2 next to like Mario Kart 8 or hell, what's

269
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,520
another game that got DLC out of nowhere?

270
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,440
There was a game not long ago that Nintendo just put out new DLC out of nowhere and it

271
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
was like, what?

272
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,760
Like they're doing this game again for some reason?

273
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,880
Okay, cool.

274
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,600
Like it just came out.

275
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,960
I think it was Mario Kart 8.

276
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,600
Was it Mario?

277
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,120
I guess I thought there was another one that they did not that long ago where I was like,

278
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,000
all right, cool.

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,640
They decided to do something new for this game.

280
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,040
And so maybe it was Mario Strikers.

281
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,520
I don't know.

282
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,240
But yeah, it was Mario Party because of the online content.

283
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,240
They just suddenly one day were like, oh yeah, we're just going to patch in online play that

284
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,360
everybody's been wanting.

285
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,720
Like it was Mario Party.

286
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,360
That's what I was thinking.

287
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,600
Guys, we figured out what online was now.

288
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,080
So, you know, one of our interns helped us out with that.

289
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,240
Now we decided to go ahead and put it in the game.

290
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,520
Anyway, I did not mean to talk down on Splatoon 2.

291
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,640
I feel like I've ruffled the feathers of the Splatoon fans in chat.

292
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,960
That's not what I was trying to do, but I'm excited for Splatoon 3.

293
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,680
I am.

294
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,000
I think I like it more than a lot of shooter games, to be honest, because I like the twist

295
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,720
on the fact that it's not like, you know, trying to get headshots necessarily.

296
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,600
I mean, I guess you can, but it's more about like the paint and the strategy of, you know,

297
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,840
even if I don't necessarily want to go right after people, what is the best way for me

298
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,200
to use my paint supply to have an impact on the team?

299
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,280
You know, there's, there's, there's a different way to think about it.

300
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,400
And I kind of, I kind of like that.

301
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,840
And the whole like swimming is kind of a neat mechanic too.

302
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,000
I just, there, there's, there's unique things that Splatoon brings to the table where I

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,600
think it's really unfair to look at it.

304
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
It's just, oh, it's a kid shooter.

305
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,000
I think it has more depth than that.

306
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,480
So, Phil of Nine in chat says, do not come for Splatoon, Rob.

307
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,360
I've got my roller and my splat gun aimed at your booty.

308
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,920
That's okay.

309
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,760
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says, we can all agree.

310
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,320
They're supporting all of these better than F-Zero right now as an actually releasing

311
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,800
something.

312
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
That hurt, but thank you.

313
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,040
Ow.

314
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,720
The truth hurts sometimes.

315
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,920
The truth hurts.

316
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,640
The truth hurts.

317
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,960
We always hurt the ones we love.

318
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,460
Right.

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,840
Let's get into speaking of the things we love.

320
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,120
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and probably those games as a service that has held our

321
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,320
attention this week.

322
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,600
Let's go with Dark Sakura.

323
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,400
How was your gaming week?

324
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,320
Well, I mentioned earlier, I started a Final Fantasy IV.

325
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:18,880
I'm actually playing a translated copy, which I am entitled to do so because I own both

326
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,040
the Japanese and the English versions.

327
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
So I started with that.

328
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:32,240
I forgot, though, like the difference in graphics between that one and six, even with five.

329
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,960
So when I'm done with Final Fantasy IV, I will be moving on to Final Fantasy V so I

330
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,840
can play as Butts.

331
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,440
His name is Butts.

332
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,680
Or Bartz.

333
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,560
I always say Butts.

334
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,960
Wasn't the unofficial translation Butts, so that's what most of us know.

335
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,800
But it was supposed to be Bartz.

336
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,760
Yeah, yeah, it's not like that.

337
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,560
Which now makes me think of Berserk.

338
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,800
But no, that was Gatsu.

339
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,280
Never mind.

340
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,360
Batsu is from Project Justice, our rival schools.

341
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
Same, same, same series.

342
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,640
I played a little bit more of Hooked on You.

343
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,360
It's cute.

344
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,080
I enjoy it.

345
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,960
I just bought that Lamb game.

346
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,600
I'm mad now.

347
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,760
Why are you mad?

348
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,240
Because I paid money for the full version.

349
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,560
Would you say you've joined a cult?

350
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,660
Never.

351
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,340
Never.

352
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,680
A gaming cult?

353
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,880
I'm investigating a cult.

354
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,840
She's starting a cult investigation podcast and she needs to be on the front lines.

355
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,960
It's called What the Fuck Is This Game After All?

356
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,440
I can't believe that there's a game called Max Gentlemen's Sexy Business, by the way.

357
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,320
I just think that's funny.

358
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,200
There's a lot of games.

359
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,680
Somebody was just saying in our Discord before the show over at vog network dot com slash

360
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,160
Discord.

361
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,440
Oh, I can't bring it up.

362
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,400
But because it'll make my co-host faces disappear.

363
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,440
But it was something about like, like a furry fighter.

364
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,320
So there's something really.

365
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,560
It sounded interesting.

366
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,160
Now I got to look it up.

367
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,200
It's going to bother me if I.

368
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,680
Corky in chat said over Discord at vog network dot com slash Discord said, I can't believe

369
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,680
you missed this in the new releases last week.

370
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,760
Linking to furry sex poker.

371
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,320
That was it.

372
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
And I'm like, you know what?

373
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,080
Not every Steam game makes our release date calendar.

374
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,840
And sometimes that's a blessing.

375
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,760
Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I just don't think that's something we

376
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,720
need to get into in this fine family program that we have.

377
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,520
There's also just like too many Steam games, honestly.

378
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,080
And they're all furry sex a little bit, aren't they?

379
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,520
There's a lot of them.

380
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,280
It's not anything new.

381
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,280
It's true.

382
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,600
Furry sex is not a new concept.

383
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,680
Anyway, moving on.

384
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:02,640
Well, anyway, there's also another game coming out that I super want called Vikings on Trampolines.

385
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,320
And I'm really hoping that they do a Mac version.

386
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,040
I actually left them some feedback hoping so.

387
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,760
I also did some experimentation.

388
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,000
So I'm not sure if you're familiar with an app called Crossover.

389
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:29,440
But Crossover is a thing to play PC applications in general.

390
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,480
Not play, but use PC applications on Mac OS.

391
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,520
And they finally have the M1 update in there.

392
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
So I installed Steam through that.

393
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,880
And then I tried to do VHS, and it wouldn't run it.

394
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,360
And so I tried to do Dead by Daylight, and it started to run it.

395
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,960
It actually got past the anti-cheat.

396
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,120
And then it was like, API error.

397
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,080
But I'm like, so I'm kind of back to square one with some of my stuff.

398
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,760
I need a good graphics card.

399
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,560
So there's that experimentation.

400
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,360
Do you want the graphics card for my old PC?

401
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Um, sure.

402
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,560
How old is it?

403
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,400
Um, five-ish years.

404
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,840
Yeah, that could work.

405
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,600
I mean, it's good enough to run Dead by Daylight.

406
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
Yeah, I played Dead by Daylight on the old machine.

407
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,400
I mean, it wasn't the best ever, but it worked.

408
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,600
Sure, certainly worth giving a shot.

409
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,080
That means then the only other thing that I'll need is

410
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
I'll just have to get a new KVM switch

411
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,760
so I can use my monitor and all my accessories.

412
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,080
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

413
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,480
Thank you.

414
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,280
Yeah, sure, why not?

415
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:47,680
Um, but, um, um, I am, I, and by the way, I have used GeForce.

416
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,040
I much prefer Stadia for my streaming stuff.

417
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,520
I used, the extent of me using GeForce was, I played a couple of things,

418
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,440
but, um, mostly now it's just enough to load up my PC copy of Dead by Daylight

419
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,360
so that I can log in and make sure that it's properly linked to my behavior account.

420
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,880
Um, like my Stadia one is because, uh, those two have, uh, cross progression.

421
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:25,200
So all of the, um, the many, many cosmetics I've bought and all of my achievements will

422
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,800
carry over between both versions.

423
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,720
Um, I have, I signed up for Luna.

424
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,440
I actually was in the beta for Luna and it's all right.

425
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,520
Um, but I don't recall Dead by Daylight being on there.

426
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,800
I don't think it is.

427
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,720
I don't think VHS is either.

428
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,320
There's really nothing on there right now.

429
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm, I'm super interested in playing.

430
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,800
Um, but, uh, as far as other things, I did beat Final Fantasy six earlier in the week.

431
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,560
Yay.

432
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,040
Congrats.

433
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,120
And of course, uh, the only thing I did not do that I wish I had done was, you know, put

434
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,240
the effort into giving Sid Goodfish so that he would live, but whatever.

435
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,240
Um, and, uh, I played my word game.

436
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,880
I'm like almost to like level 10,000.

437
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,840
I'm not even kidding.

438
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,960
I play that game a lot.

439
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,640
Um, and then I did like some words on stream with people.

440
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,840
I think that counts as a game.

441
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,880
Cause that game is kind of fun, but I don't play it against most people because not to

442
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,040
toot my own horn, but I'm really fucking good at it.

443
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,920
And I want to be fair to other people.

444
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,320
I don't want to monopolize all the points because I'm a word nerd.

445
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Well, I do like that we're playing a Scrabble against Bobby.

446
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,160
I do like the words on stream has like a cool down.

447
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,040
Like you can only get one word every so many seconds.

448
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,200
So it's, it's hard to monopolize things.

449
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,560
When the majority of people are misspelling simple words.

450
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,040
Oh yeah.

451
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,640
Then, you know, well that's, yeah.

452
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
Got to look for those red underlines.

453
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,760
Yeah.

454
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,320
Well, I mean, I don't know that they even care or see them, but it is what it is.

455
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,760
But anyway, that that's been most of my gaming.

456
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,240
Oh yeah.

457
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,560
And I did play, uh, some doctor who, and I played some world cup soccer.

458
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,160
All right.

459
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,520
For the record, the, the, uh, the clothing site is fourth wall.

460
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,400
Elsie just told me.

461
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,440
Oh, okay.

462
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,000
Well, I'll look into it.

463
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,160
Um, or you look into it and tell me how it is.

464
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:33,840
All right.

465
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,600
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

466
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,320
It's all Minecraft again.

467
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,920
That's, that's what I've been playing.

468
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,200
So put out a new episode, uh, earlier this week and just been kind of figuring out what

469
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,700
I want to do.

470
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,160
It's the typical cycle.

471
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,520
All right.

472
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,000
Fair enough.

473
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,680
What about the game plan behind you tonight on stream as we, uh, I don't think I've said

474
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,080
the typical plug yet as we do tape live every Sunday night, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock

475
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,440
Pacific at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

476
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,800
That's VOG network right after the Bobby black will show.

477
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,320
Who was talking about an amazing book series about, I I'm not going to get into the whole

478
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,160
thing or repeat the whole story, but it was like basically like learning to program basic

479
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,600
by like participating in a second person book series.

480
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,440
And you became like, it was really fascinating to me and I'm like, I wanted those books and

481
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,920
I was a kid.

482
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,560
Where were those?

483
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,200
Anyway, go, go listen to Bobby if you want to hear more about that.

484
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,720
Um, but what's the game plan behind you looking.

485
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
So it's a game called writing fights.

486
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,920
Um, no particular reason other than I saw it when I was looking for long plays of stuff

487
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,280
and it looked weird.

488
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,200
It's like, you know how every single one of those fighting games or not really fighting

489
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,960
is beat them up games had that level where you're on like a hoverboard or something like

490
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,200
that.

491
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,840
It was, it was like, Oh, you're on a hoverboard, but it really, it's just the same gameplay

492
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,160
again.

493
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,840
It's the mode seven level.

494
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,600
There's always going to be a mode seven level in any like super Nintendo game.

495
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,080
Exactly.

496
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,240
So this entire game is basically that, but what's funny though is like, you're actually,

497
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,920
you can like fight, um, cars and stuff like that.

498
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,960
It's just ridiculous.

499
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,080
Okay.

500
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,880
It looked weird.

501
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,280
Good times.

502
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,240
Oh, I picked it.

503
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,280
All right.

504
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,960
Uh, let's see my gaming week.

505
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,000
So, um, okay.

506
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,240
So I, I've been teasing it enough.

507
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,640
I also played cult of the lamb for the first time.

508
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,400
I had to play something new this week because I was going to be coming into this show again,

509
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,560
going, I played some more dead by daylight.

510
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,400
I played some more Final Fantasy 14.

511
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,920
I play all the same shit I always play, but I was like, all right, I want to play something

512
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,240
new.

513
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,000
So I checked out this cult of the lamb game because I had heard the talk about, Oh, it's

514
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,280
like animal crossing, but instead of animal crossing cute characters, you're trying to

515
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,720
get them all to join a cult.

516
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,880
And if they like try to disobey you, you kill them and you bury them in the back of

517
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
the compound.

518
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,200
No.

519
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,680
Well, okay.

520
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,880
So here's the thing.

521
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,120
I think that headline about the, um, animal crossing ask element of it that came from

522
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,640
a Kotaku article getting my hands on the game.

523
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,360
I actually don't think it's really, it's, it's like animal crossing.

524
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,800
The only thing it has in common with animal crossing is this cute animal characters.

525
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,440
I think that's it.

526
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,680
Yeah.

527
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah.

528
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,320
The game itself feels a little more like the binding of Isaac.

529
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,920
I think would be a good comparison for the, um, rogue like element meets don't starve

530
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,040
for the crafting element and kind of building the village area.

531
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,720
And that's the part that I think people are comparing a little bit to animal crossing,

532
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,320
but I'm like, I feel like animal crossing.

533
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,800
No, like it's just, I don't know how to explain it, but it's just a totally different vibe

534
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,840
in animal crossing.

535
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,200
Uh, this game, obviously the whole like cute characters joining a cult.

536
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,240
I mean, it's, it's, it's selling the game on concept really.

537
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,520
Cause I'm going to be honest, like the, the rogue like park part and the city building

538
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,240
part are not particularly novel games, either one of them.

539
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,120
They're not doing anything the genre hasn't seen before.

540
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,720
It's just the way they're doing it and the way they're implementing it.

541
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,720
And I will say, I think one of the smartest big brain things the developers did, and I'm

542
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,520
not saying, by the way, I want to make this very clear.

543
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,440
I'm not saying that makes it a bad game.

544
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,760
No, of course not.

545
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,000
Like comfort food is comfort food.

546
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Sometimes relying on these old tricks and old genres is a great thing.

547
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,480
I think the big brain stuff these developers did were all the Twitch integrations that

548
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,200
they did, which if I'm not mistaken, allow the followers to be people that are watching

549
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,840
your channel.

550
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,960
It's it's simple, but it's brilliant.

551
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,560
It's fucking brilliant because I'll tell you, I'm looking at my Twitch list right

552
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:34,960
now.

553
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,560
There's three people streaming that game.

554
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,360
Nobody knew about this game two weeks ago, and now it's becoming the hot, the hot new

555
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,440
must have on Twitch.

556
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,960
I know it's getting through the Dead by Daylight community.

557
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,120
Cause that has to be how Dark Sakura saw it on Twitch and got convinced to buy it once

558
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,560
she saw it ran on her system.

559
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,120
I don't know.

560
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,800
That's or was it something else?

561
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,720
It was literally you mentioning it.

562
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,880
Oh, my impact.

563
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,280
Thank you.

564
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,960
Well, I saw that it runs on Mac.

565
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,320
I was like, okay, I'll do it.

566
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,840
I'm supporting more companies that are doing content for Mac.

567
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,400
Fair.

568
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,800
I did see Isaaco streaming it last night, so I figured maybe he's seen them streaming

569
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,200
it or something.

570
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,960
I know there's been other DVD streamers have played.

571
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,040
I started playing at 8 30 and stopped streaming at two in the morning, which for me is unheard

572
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,520
of.

573
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,240
That's pretty late.

574
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,760
Yeah.

575
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,960
And by the time I went to bed, I just super passed out.

576
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,760
And like, if not for Dan waking me up, I probably would have kept sleeping.

577
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,260
Yeah.

578
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:35,840
Let's see.

579
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,120
Fifth Dream in chat says one of my animals asked me if he could eat some poop.

580
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,040
So I cooked him a bowl of poop and he ate it.

581
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,760
Quest complete.

582
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,400
It's those types of the face Dark Sakura just made.

583
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,520
I'm sorry.

584
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,320
Sorry.

585
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,720
I had to explain that for the podcast, folks.

586
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,560
But yeah, yeah, I guess that is something.

587
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,960
Well, but I guess, you know, cleaning up your cult members poop is part of the game.

588
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,040
And that's I didn't know you could feed it back to them.

589
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,360
That's.

590
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
Well, many animals eat their own crap.

591
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,400
I guess so.

592
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,680
All right.

593
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,520
There's a lot of people who will eat their own crap.

594
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,360
And I mean that metaphorically.

595
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,560
But it's wild shit like that, literally, which is why everybody's talking about this game

596
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:25,040
right now, because again, the the the game element of the game is is for all intents

597
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,920
and purposes, a tired formula at this point.

598
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,200
It's like a roguelike and a sim game.

599
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,080
What a tired fucking formula format at this point.

600
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,840
But this game pulls it off because it says, well, what if we do something really sick

601
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,880
and twisted with it?

602
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,740
Yes.

603
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,080
That's it.

604
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,360
That's that's the guy.

605
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,680
Any original ideas anymore?

606
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,160
Just original executions.

607
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,400
Yeah.

608
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,760
And that and that's what it is.

609
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,960
It's the execution.

610
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,440
It's the building in that Twitch integration from the because I believe this game is still

611
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,560
early access.

612
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,360
So it's literally Twitch integration at the ground level.

613
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,080
And I saw it was called out in chat that the Twitch stuff is still buggy.

614
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,120
Of course it is.

615
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,520
But it doesn't matter that type of stuff, especially like, you know, being able to have

616
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,240
your viewers be in your village and cooking dishes for them and all that stuff like that

617
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:20,960
is funny.

618
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,960
And that is, you know, that is building community one way or another.

619
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,960
So it's it's just like the execution of it.

620
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
I think it's a very good way to put it.

621
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,120
The genre tired, been done better before the execution, a plus.

622
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,200
That's that's where they've nailed it.

623
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,840
That's what it is.

624
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,720
So that was my thoughts on Cult of the Lamb.

625
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,160
The only other new ish thing I did this week, so Loki to follow up on your stories from

626
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,360
last week, I went to round one locally on Friday, so I got to see the new round one.

627
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,160
It was it was OK.

628
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,720
But also, I think because you said this to the BeatMania 2DX machines, one of them was

629
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,880
broken and it was in pieces.

630
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,360
Like literally they're they're trying to it looked like to me that they're trying to

631
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,360
replace the because it has the old school levers on it and the other machine has the

632
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,720
actual touch pad that the newer 2DX machines have for all the equalizer and all the additional

633
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,520
functionality.

634
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,120
It looked to me like they're trying to switch the old one to one of those or something.

635
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,400
But it just maybe it surprised me that it was so broken the first week.

636
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,600
Otherwise, like I'm just my back was super hurting and I don't know why I must have pulled

637
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,120
a muscle in it on Friday or something.

638
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,440
So like there was no way I really wanted to play DDR and take a picture and send it to

639
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,000
YYR.

640
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,240
But the way my back was feeling, that was not going to happen.

641
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,520
And there was too many people around where I didn't even want to play the easy stuff.

642
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,000
But I did play some BeatMania 2DX and Shane was making fun of me because I was playing

643
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,320
Boomer songs in 2DX, but I don't care.

644
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,080
I'm yes, I am going to play Burning Heat from 7th style.

645
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,920
And I think I think I played Rizlim from 5th style or 4th style like I was playing old

646
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,400
shit.

647
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,280
And yes, I love.

648
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,640
But the problem is my skill level has regressed completely.

649
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,680
Like I failed.

650
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
I did In My Eyes.

651
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,720
You remember that song?

652
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,040
In my eyes.

653
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,680
So I have some complicated note patterns, but that song used to be like easy.

654
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,640
I failed it.

655
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,680
I was like, OMG, this is sad, but it's just going to take practice.

656
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,720
Otherwise, the round one itself was fine.

657
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,320
I didn't love how they had all the music games shoved in one corner.

658
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:37,120
It also felt like there wasn't as much like the games were tightly packed in.

659
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,120
There wasn't as much space to move around the games as there is in other round ones

660
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,760
that I've been to.

661
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,440
That was the other weird thing for me is I was like, dang, this place is like packed

662
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,880
in tight here.

663
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,360
But I mean, I guess like, can you fault an arcade for wanting to maximize the real estate

664
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,080
that they have?

665
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,200
I don't think I can.

666
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,440
But yeah, and when you kind of look at like what music games they have side by side with

667
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,760
any other round one, it's pretty comparable.

668
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,600
I mean, yeah, I noticed Dance Rush was missing, but they had two of those other ones.

669
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,000
Was that a Hatsune Miku dance game or something?

670
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,640
I don't know.

671
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,120
Dance Around is what it's called.

672
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,920
I don't know.

673
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,720
It looks stupid.

674
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,360
Oh, yeah, they did have the Hatsune Miku.

675
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,200
I don't know that one was either, but that almost looked like sort of like Para Para,

676
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,680
but not.

677
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,720
I don't know.

678
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,960
I just looked over and I swear I saw Hatsune Miku in it.

679
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:31,440
Yeah, so they have like two of those two, but they had two of the dance arounds, which

680
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,760
looks like like an evolution of dance evolution that they put out the one that's like sort

681
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:47,200
of kind of, you know, actually what it reminds me of now that I think of it, it's a little

682
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,080
bit like just dance almost like they have it where you have to strike a certain pose

683
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,600
that's what it looks like.

684
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,520
Yeah, it looks like it's like a just dance or I don't remember a dance evolution too

685
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:01,760
much.

686
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,000
So I don't remember if it was like that because I remember that game was like similar to Para

687
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,080
and they had like Para songs in it.

688
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,680
But no, I had no interest in playing dance around.

689
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,120
And there's two of them.

690
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,760
I liked that.

691
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,520
What was that circle cross or something?

692
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,640
The cross circle, the giant circle.

693
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,960
It looked like it looked like it was a sequel to cross beats because you tap on the screen

694
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,880
and you spin this circle with the giant button.

695
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,760
Yeah, Chrono circle.

696
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,080
That's it.

697
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,200
Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.

698
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,320
That one looked really cool.

699
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,120
I didn't have a chance, but it was actually really crowded when we went.

700
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,480
So the arcades doing well for what it's worth.

701
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,440
So as Joe and Hunter Matt says, did you play any of the claw games for some sweet plushes?

702
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,560
Round ones are the only place where I've been able to win claw games, mostly because they

703
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,000
give hints on how to win.

704
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,600
That is my husband's department.

705
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,720
I very rarely touch those things, but my husband, my husband will play the claw games online.

706
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,600
Like suddenly we'll like a big stuffed animal will show up at the door and I'm like, were

707
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,520
you playing those fucking claw games online again?

708
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,440
No, they just said this to me by accident.

709
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,480
No, I won a prize.

710
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:14,560
I do have to admit round one crane games are fairly easy, but nothing beats the cheap claw

711
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:22,240
game in the Walmart and Lodi where I had to get a lot of plastic bag to carry home my

712
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,880
plushies.

713
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,760
Yeah, I was going to say there was a lot of people with plushies when I went through that

714
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,240
one time.

715
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,840
They had a lot of people playing the crane games, which I'm surprised because I always

716
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,440
thought those are kind of a rip off.

717
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,920
I had to replace my amusement pass, though, which made me sad.

718
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,160
But I realized I lost my other one in the move, but and I'm not sure like I have mine,

719
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,480
but I couldn't get to work because it was asking me for a pin.

720
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,240
And then I used the pin that I normally use.

721
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,600
And I was like, it didn't work.

722
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,440
So I'm like, Oh, weird.

723
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,400
I was able to register mine.

724
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:48,640
Okay.

725
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,160
But I did it on the 2DX machines.

726
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,960
I don't know.

727
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,560
And they translated some of 2DX to English, but not all of it, which is weird.

728
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,360
Like you'll see these screens in English and you'll see some in Japanese.

729
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,440
And I'm like, it's kind of typical, though.

730
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,880
Then they did that.

731
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,680
Sounds like DDR.

732
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

733
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,240
I just I've never seen it would be meaning a 2DX.

734
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,680
That's the thing that was weird to me.

735
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,560
So anyway, enough local arcade chat.

736
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,400
But it was it was the thing that I went and did.

737
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,080
I wasn't there very long, all things considered, because then it was like, let's go to the

738
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,960
cheesecake factory.

739
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,600
So we did.

740
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,840
But I was around one for a little bit.

741
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,440
And it was it was the I'd go again, but I'll probably go during the week when there's likely

742
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,560
to be less people there.

743
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,680
It was just very crowded.

744
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,880
School is starting up.

745
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,080
So I'm excited.

746
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,640
I'm excited.

747
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,400
Go home and do your schoolwork, kiddos.

748
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,640
All right.

749
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,960
Like allegedly, I mean, I don't know, because there's conflicting times on their website

750
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,920
and on the door.

751
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
The door says they're open till 2 a.m. every day.

752
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,960
The website says they're open till midnight every day.

753
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,360
Yeah, I thought they were open until midnight.

754
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,400
And you have to go into the parking lot entrance, not the mall entrance.

755
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,920
Yeah, of course.

756
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,960
I mean, that makes sense.

757
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,160
So anyway.

758
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,660
All right.

759
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,640
That's it for our gaming weeks.

760
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,320
Let's get into some other news.

761
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,240
Oh, first, housekeeping, because I haven't plugged this in a little bit here on this

762
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,920
show, and I'm not even sure my co-hosts will remember, but we're not going to be here in

763
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,400
one, two, three weeks, Labor Day weekend, as is customary for me the last 10 years,

764
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,160
Dragon Con weekend.

765
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,280
So I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con if you're in the area and you're down for conventions.

766
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,440
I understand everybody's got their own tolerance levels right now, and that's completely cool.

767
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,080
So I don't want to like say, be there or you suck.

768
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,120
Nope, I understand.

769
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,400
You got to do what's best for you.

770
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,560
But if you are going to be at Dragon Con in the area, come say hi.

771
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,760
I'm not talking about my panel schedule yet because things change right up until the last

772
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,000
minute.

773
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,720
They always do.

774
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,240
The app should be released this next week, I think.

775
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,800
And once it's released, I'll talk about my panels.

776
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,880
All I'm going to say this early, as usual, I have panels on digital media.

777
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
I'm always thankful that that track has me.

778
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,120
Thank you.

779
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,280
Thank you to Charles and everybody on the digital media crew.

780
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,080
We've got some fun panels on that this year.

781
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,040
Bobby submitted a new idea for VOG to lead.

782
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,000
And y'all are going to, when you hear who they put on that panel, you're going to be

783
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,960
like, what?

784
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,600
So we'll talk about that in a couple of weeks.

785
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,520
And I have some stuff on the gaming track.

786
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,160
Tentatively, I have a ballroom panel.

787
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,920
So I'll again be teasing that next week.

788
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,200
But that's if it's a ballroom, that means they're expecting a big crowd.

789
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,920
So there's that.

790
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,680
And then there's a third track, a mystery track that not literally the mystery track,

791
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,960
but I will reveal it next week.

792
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,720
And all I'm going to say is, if you had told me three years ago I would be working with

793
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,400
this track, I would have said, what?

794
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,560
But I'm very, very, very happy and excited about it.

795
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,840
So yeah.

796
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,200
Bobby says we both have ballroom panels this year.

797
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,800
If I'm not mistaken, Bobby, we have the exact same panel on different days.

798
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,880
Again, it's a panel where they're expecting to fill the room twice.

799
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,200
So I'm going to leave it at that.

800
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,880
It's exciting.

801
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,560
Jaskren in chat says, and Bobby will have the more full one.

802
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,720
Absolutely.

803
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,960
Because mine is on Monday.

804
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,680
And for most people, Dragon Con is over on Monday.

805
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,760
So but Bobby's will be more full.

806
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,480
But you know what?

807
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,440
I'm glad Bobby gets to have his moment because I had that huge Overwatch panel a couple of

808
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,240
years ago.

809
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,520
So this is going to be great for Bobby.

810
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,240
I'm really excited.

811
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,360
And I'm excited to do it too.

812
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,480
I'm just excited to have this opportunity.

813
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,560
So that's going to be in a few weeks.

814
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,280
So we will not be here the night of the fourth because I'll be at Dragon Con.

815
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,560
I imagine if DarkSakura is around, she'll be doing some streaming.

816
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,840
Loki will be working on the Minecraft vids and stuff.

817
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,040
So good stuff.

818
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,560
They've been talking about doing more streaming.

819
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,760
There's other people that I play with.

820
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,520
They stream a lot more than I do.

821
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,920
But I do want to get back into it.

822
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
I just have to find something to do.

823
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,560
It's probably gonna be just like, we're going down into a mine and doing all that stuff.

824
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,120
Maybe.

825
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,440
Maybe.

826
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,440
People still watch it.

827
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,480
We're talking about streamlines.

828
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,600
Yeah, because yeah, seriously.

829
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,200
Loki just played Dead by Daylight.

830
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,480
It's worked for the rest of us.

831
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,760
No, no.

832
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,240
All right.

833
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,480
Pod Culture says was going to try and do a one day visit to Dragon Con, but they aren't

834
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,320
selling single day passes online.

835
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,560
I think they were and they sold out fast.

836
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,440
They are not selling single day passes on site.

837
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,920
That is a change they made due to COVID.

838
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,360
Like, you know, they're trying to scale back the attendance a little bit.

839
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,480
And that's one way they're doing it is they're no longer selling badges at the door.

840
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,280
So that was a change they made to try to thin out the convention a little bit, which quite

841
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,600
frankly, versus like last year, it was weird because we were right in the midst of the

842
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,120
Delta wave and all that stuff.

843
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,320
But masks were required as they're required this year.

844
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,560
I was directly in front of somebody who had COVID.

845
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,280
I didn't get COVID at the con because everybody was masked up.

846
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,480
It was fabulous.

847
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:58,240
So but I loved last year that the convention was like only half full and it was beautiful

848
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,080
to be able to walk around and go wherever you needed to go without bumping into people.

849
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,800
So yeah.

850
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,680
Oh, Pod Culture says I get why.

851
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,040
Just by the time I found out I could swing it a day, it was too late.

852
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,240
I'm sorry, Pod Culture.

853
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,560
Sorry.

854
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,240
All right.

855
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,640
Anyhow.

856
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,440
Um, so let's get into some more gaming news and talk about what's going on.

857
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,680
We'll start with Loki.

858
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,800
What's in the news this week?

859
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,520
So, um, well, Activision wants, or I should say Activision Blizzard wants to let you know

860
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,560
that there's good news.

861
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,520
They have gotten rid of loot boxes in Overwatch 2.

862
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,840
And you know, when they're always giving you good news like that, that it's not really

863
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,400
good news, because if it was good news, they wouldn't be happy about it.

864
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,880
So in this case, they're replacing the loot boxes that were in the game forever with the

865
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,480
battle pass system that they have now.

866
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,400
My thought is because one, they're probably making more money off of the battle pass system,

867
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,160
which is why they're doing it in the first place.

868
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,400
And also because they can put out a press release like this and say, look, we're not,

869
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,000
you know, we're not making it by loot boxes.

870
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:14,640
So, um, but loot boxes themselves though, will be done with, uh, very soon, actually

871
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,400
in October, which I think is when, uh, Overwatch 2 is coming out.

872
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,600
Um, and then they said that, uh, loot boxes that players are sitting on will automatically

873
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,760
open before the launch of Overwatch 2.

874
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,720
Cause, Oh yeah, that's right.

875
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,360
Cause didn't they have loot boxes, but like the keys cost money is what it was.

876
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,920
No, you, you would get some loot boxes.

877
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,440
Like every time you level up, you'd get a loot box or an event loot box or something

878
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,240
like that.

879
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,800
Um, and then, um, you could also buy and get a lot of cosmetics that way, which people

880
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,080
would like to do during the holiday events, because it was the only way to get some of

881
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,840
the legendary skins or in loot boxes.

882
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,200
But of course we all know the controversy behind loot boxes.

883
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,640
So Blizzard's kind of walking away from that a little bit because they see a different

884
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,760
way to make money on this game.

885
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,400
And I think in general, people just kind of seem to like the battle pass stuff better

886
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,520
than the loot boxes.

887
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,640
This is, that's exactly what Dead by Daylight has in it is the battle pass system and it

888
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,360
works.

889
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,120
So I'm, I'm sure it's going to work fine for Overwatch as well, to be honest.

890
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,120
Probably.

891
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,680
Yeah.

892
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,080
Yeah.

893
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,440
So, um, now some folks in chat are saying there's still loot boxes.

894
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,400
You just can't buy it.

895
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,200
Does that mean you still get like a free like thing every time you level up or do like,

896
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,080
if you're queuing is something in need, sometimes you get a loot box.

897
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,160
I don't remember all the different ways you get it.

898
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,960
But, um, is that still all going to be available or are they sunsetting that as well in favor

899
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,880
of like a premium currency or something like, cause that would exactly be dead by daylight

900
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,360
in that case.

901
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,440
No, they just basically said that loot boxes will no longer be available for sale at the

902
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,240
after the end of anniversary remix three event on August 30th.

903
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,400
And then, um, you, it says, uh, earn and purchase anniversary loot boxes through the event.

904
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,800
So they're still doing stuff that you can earn.

905
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,480
Um, I guess it's just going to be for purchase.

906
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,760
It looks like, okay.

907
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,480
Since it says there will not be available for sale, but I'm sure that if they're giving

908
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,160
them away for free, nobody is necessarily complaining about that.

909
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,000
Um, that they'll probably still be doing something similar for that, but like you just can't

910
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,720
purchase them.

911
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,960
Yeah.

912
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,600
I see them as just walking away from this controversy at the time when their company

913
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,080
is surrounded in controversy anyway.

914
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,480
And going to something that the industry seems to have accepted a little more, um, for, for

915
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:36,880
what it is.

916
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,240
And I know I keep referencing dead by daylight, but that's just cause it's the game, you know,

917
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,640
both our soccer and I are all in on that and we play it a lot, but certainly there are

918
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,640
plenty of other games to do battle passes.

919
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,880
Like Fortnite is a huge example too.

920
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,280
Uh, what the call of duty even has their own battle, but like it's a very, very common

921
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,840
system in games now, dead by daylight.

922
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,960
Doesn't do a battle pass.

923
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,040
What would you call it?

924
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,440
You just buy the episodes or the DLC, but you don't have to have them to play or to

925
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,040
play against those killers or with those other survivors.

926
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,320
It's more of a pay to unlock, not necessarily like a battle pass system.

927
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:21,120
Well, if you don't, if you don't buy the pass, you can still play the game.

928
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,080
You just don't have access to some of the content.

929
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,520
That's like, well, like I'm thinking of like the rift pass or whatever is all cosmetics.

930
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,560
That's all it is cosmetics.

931
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,400
They don't like put killers or anything in there, but like in Overwatch, that's what

932
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:34,960
they're doing too.

933
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,440
They're not going to lock any characters in the battle pass or anything.

934
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,120
It's all just cosmetics.

935
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,960
I just, I don't think of it as a battle pass.

936
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,260
Yeah.

937
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,160
Mike Defton Chat says you need to be playing a whole lot and you get three weekly boxes

938
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,520
for winning nine matches.

939
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,720
That is a lot of matches.

940
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,280
It doesn't sound like a lot, but it is, especially when you have to win them.

941
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,560
All right.

942
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,880
I mean, I'll probably try the new Overwatch when it comes out.

943
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,520
I don't know.

944
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,360
Like it's just one of those add it to the backlog of things I got to play.

945
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:07,860
We'll see.

946
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,960
So, all right, moving on.

947
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,440
Let's talk about some of the news that THQ Nordic put out this week.

948
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,520
So they had their own little showcase that was online and some of the things that they

949
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,520
talked about were Alone in the Dark.

950
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,840
They're going to be doing a reimagining of Alone in the Dark from 1992.

951
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,080
We don't know a whole lot about it, but apparently it does bring over concepts

952
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,760
and characters from the original trilogy.

953
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,720
They look good.

954
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,220
Yeah.

955
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,960
But I'm not sure.

956
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,240
I don't think it's supposed to be a remake.

957
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,440
I think it's more like a relaunch or a retelling or reboot.

958
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,400
It's like a remake.

959
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,280
How Resident Evil 7 is sort of like a remake of the Resident Evil series type of thing.

960
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:45,840
Gotcha.

961
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,480
It's kind of like a whole different take on it.

962
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,040
Let's put it this way.

963
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,840
It looks better than the last remake of Alone in the Dark.

964
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,160
Now, if you want to just have a straight up remake,

965
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,200
then you've got Destroy All Humans 2 re-probed.

966
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,400
They are just remaking that for PS5, the series consoles for Xbox and PC.

967
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,280
So that is happening.

968
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,720
Space for Sale is a game that they're going to be putting out where you, you know,

969
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,640
I love my space games and you do get to explore planets, build properties

970
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,760
and ensure the inhabitants of the planets are satisfied.

971
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,880
So it also uses procedurally generated landscape,

972
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,120
like another space game I really enjoy.

973
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,600
But I don't think it's quite as in-depth on that front as maybe No Man's Sky.

974
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,440
But it does look like a cute little space game.

975
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,120
It'd be cool.

976
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,200
Speaking of remakes, Gothic, the original 90s RPG,

977
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,680
the original Gothic game is getting a remake.

978
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,480
That's kind of cool.

979
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,160
So that's coming out for PS5 series and PC.

980
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,760
Jagged Alliance 3 is on its way.

981
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,960
In this strategy game, you get to operate mercenaries

982
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,920
and you get tactical strategy shown in the trailer.

983
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,200
This is the first Jagged Alliance game in 14 years.

984
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,840
Just heads up.

985
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,440
The Valiant was another game that they showed during this.

986
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,560
Again, it's an RTS type of game.

987
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,800
So there's a co-op mode in this game as well.

988
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,280
And a second player can drop in and out, which is kind of neat.

989
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,400
Tempest Rising was another game.

990
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,160
3D Realms is a part of this, and it's a military based RTS game.

991
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,640
It's a post a nuclear war game.

992
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
And you pick from one of three factions.

993
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,040
You gather resources, et cetera, et cetera.

994
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,600
Don't get me excited by saying Tempest.

995
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,040
Yeah, sorry.

996
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,840
Not that Tempest.

997
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,340
Different one.

998
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,320
Knights of Honor 2.

999
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,720
It's a game like Age of Empires or Civilization,

1000
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,880
but you're doing your own medieval kingdom.

1001
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,960
You appoint marshals and clerics and you ally with other nations

1002
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,280
and kill those that aren't cooperating with you.

1003
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,120
Outcast 2, a new beginning.

1004
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,120
This is a sequel to the PC game from the 90s, Outcast.

1005
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,800
Yes, all these decades later.

1006
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,320
Outcast 2, a new beginning.

1007
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,080
Slated for PS5, Xbox series, and PC.

1008
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,480
A game called Recreation, spelled W-R-E-C-K, Recreation.

1009
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,080
It's an open world racer.

1010
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm assuming maybe going for a little bit of that burnout vibe,

1011
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,640
but it has the Loki factor.

1012
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,560
Meaning players can build their own tracks and share them with users.

1013
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,840
And speaking of the burnout connection,

1014
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,480
Fiona Sperry and Alex Ward, who created Burnout, are behind this game.

1015
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,160
So it's Burnout with a track editor.

1016
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,720
So this is the Loki game.

1017
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,560
Who's the other one that they just...

1018
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,000
The other Burnout type game that was...

1019
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,720
It was just like all the Crash Mode stuff, but it was its own game.

1020
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,280
I don't remember, but it was okay.

1021
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,240
Yeah, digital release.

1022
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,760
I don't remember what it's called, but I didn't play it.

1023
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,080
But yeah, I'll check it out.

1024
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,680
Way of the Hunter, a hunting sim.

1025
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,320
So if you've ever actually played Deer Hunter in a Walmart arcade,

1026
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
this is probably a game up your alley.

1027
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,040
If you haven't, then probably not.

1028
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,920
Did you see the Big Buck Hunter that they had at round one with the Terminator stuff in there?

1029
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,280
No, I didn't see that.

1030
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,160
It's so messed up.

1031
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,520
I'm like, Terminator?

1032
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,020
What?

1033
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:15,700
No, I saw the gigantic dot matrix looking puzzle bobble game, though.

1034
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,140
Oh, yeah, that looks awesome.

1035
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,020
I want to play that.

1036
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,620
I watched Shane and his husband play that, and it looked silly.

1037
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,220
And then there was a giant Kinect 4 game, and I was like, this is also silly.

1038
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,140
So yeah, lots of silly ticket munchers in that game.

1039
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,220
Anyway, let's see.

1040
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,180
What else do we have?

1041
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,940
Oh, hey, wrestling fans.

1042
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,020
We have something for you.

1043
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,020
AEW Fight Forever.

1044
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,100
It's a wrestling game, and it's going to be shown at Gamescom 2022.

1045
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,660
Another game called Stuntfest.

1046
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,820
If you like to eject from cars, Stuntfest is for you.

1047
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:53,860
The driver gets to be launched in the air and bounced off obstacles before going back

1048
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,740
in their vehicles.

1049
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,940
All right, a closed beta starting this weekend.

1050
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:03,620
And it sounds like that almost sounds like burnout a little bit.

1051
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,620
SpongeBob SquarePants, the Cosmic Shake is also coming out.

1052
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:13,220
It's coming out for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so it's lagging behind a generation,

1053
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,980
but it is a SpongeBob SquarePants game.

1054
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:20,420
And then at the very, very end, they teased a South Park game, but that's all we know.

1055
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:25,860
But I would assume it's not a role playing game because that's Ubisoft's area.

1056
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,780
So I don't care.

1057
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,580
It'll be awesome.

1058
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:35,860
So I could see why they'll do the SpongeBob stuff for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1059
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,660
It's the sibling consoles now.

1060
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:43,940
Yeah, or you handed it down to your children's bedroom consoles.

1061
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,500
Exactly.

1062
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah.

1063
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,860
Plus the newer stuff, even though we make fun of Sony for backwards compatibility,

1064
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,780
sometimes the reality is PlayStation 5 will play all the PS4 games.

1065
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,140
So it's not like you can't say SpongeBob isn't available on PS5.

1066
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,460
It is in backwards compatibility mode.

1067
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,260
So there's that.

1068
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:07,460
So Tiger Claw says, Where would they take the third South Park game?

1069
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,540
The first one was LARPing in a fantasy world.

1070
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,900
The second one was superheroes.

1071
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,580
Wouldn't this be a different genre?

1072
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,820
Because Ubisoft made those other games.

1073
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,860
Not Nordic, right?

1074
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,140
Or did THG bring in another sequel to South Park 64?

1075
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,140
The best South Park game ever made.

1076
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,900
How about a first person shooter game?

1077
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,700
That's what I'm thinking, because I wasn't that legit a THQ game.

1078
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,860
South Park 64, I feel like it was.

1079
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,580
It may have been.

1080
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,220
That game was awful, but I loved it.

1081
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:37,860
I played it.

1082
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,220
I rented it from Blockbuster.

1083
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,540
Yeah, I'd totally play that again.

1084
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,040
All right.

1085
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:48,660
Let's move on to a somewhat innovative new way to test some of these games potentially,

1086
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,540
right, Dark Sakura?

1087
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,280
You're muted.

1088
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:01,300
It's also some good news for Stadia.

1089
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,180
So Stadia has a...

1090
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:16,580
They're testing a type of game trial under its click-to-play system, about a 50-50 one.

1091
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,980
What they're doing is for two games, which is Control and Sniper Elite 4,

1092
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:31,220
50% get a normal timer on the demo, and the other ones get unlimited access

1093
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,380
until they unlock certain achievements.

1094
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,340
So you could play and never hit those achievements,

1095
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,580
unless it's like, you finished stage one.

1096
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,100
Here, yay.

1097
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,140
Have an achievement.

1098
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:43,780
Oh, you're done.

1099
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:49,460
But at any rate, they're doing these on a 50-50 split to examine

1100
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,380
what effects it has on the trial length metric.

1101
00:54:54,180 --> 00:55:01,380
So is it going to grant a person more time on the trial?

1102
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,620
Is it going to let the person experience more of the game and lead to a purchase?

1103
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:09,140
So those are different things that they're going to look at.

1104
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,780
So as an example, for Sniper Elite 4,

1105
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:15,540
you try the game until you complete the beginning of the end achievement,

1106
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,340
which comes at the end of the first mission, sort of like I was saying before.

1107
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:24,260
Which if you don't get the first mission done, I guess in 90 minutes,

1108
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,820
then this lets you finish the first mission.

1109
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:36,740
So this means that players who can't finish the first level in that time period,

1110
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:44,820
they will be able to keep trying until they do and have a more complete experience with it.

1111
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:54,340
And as one of the Stadia reps said,

1112
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:58,020
is that they want new players to experience the observe, plan,

1113
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,540
execute mantra that sits behind the game, as they're saying.

1114
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:06,660
So you can run and gun, but the best results come from considering your options

1115
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,340
and planning your attack accordingly.

1116
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,900
So they want people to be able to take their time and play it as if they own the game.

1117
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,380
And I think that it's a really, really good idea.

1118
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:22,340
It also allows for better feedback, I think, of the game.

1119
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,660
So if someone plays through that first level just really fast,

1120
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:33,540
trying to get it done or get to the next level within that time frame,

1121
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:37,060
they're not really getting the full experience of the game, is what they're thinking.

1122
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,460
So by being able to sit back and do the whole first level

1123
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:47,380
and chill with it, that's kind of what our old demos used to be like.

1124
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:52,420
For example, we'd get those PlayStation demo disks, and it'd be like,

1125
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,900
oh, here's the whole first level of Jumping Flash,

1126
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,220
or here's the whole first level of Jammer Lamy.

1127
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:03,060
You get a better chance to enjoy the game and play around with it a little bit.

1128
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,100
And as far as some other...

1129
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:13,220
They want to do some other types of experiments for different genre.

1130
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:17,220
So one of them, as an example, would be

1131
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:21,700
imagine trying an RPG and starting at level 100 instead of level 1,

1132
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:27,380
or a turn-based strategy when you've got the full kingdom

1133
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,620
instead of just a village at your disposal.

1134
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,020
So seeing what the full advanced version of the game could be,

1135
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,940
and that it might be worth owning to work up to it.

1136
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:46,660
Now, there's a few other things going on with Stadia,

1137
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:54,580
but right now they've been doing some more business with developers,

1138
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:57,060
like giving them a cut of the Stadia Pro revenue.

1139
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,140
And issuing out new developer tools.

1140
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:08,740
So they are, I think, finding a bit more of a stride.

1141
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,540
And I think that we're starting to see a lot more benefit for it.

1142
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,660
I can also tell you that, with the exception of last night,

1143
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,660
I have had a much smoother gaming experience on Stadia

1144
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,940
than I have on even some home platforms.

1145
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,500
Like, typically, when I'm playing Dead by Daylight,

1146
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,860
I don't get lag.

1147
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,940
Now, last night I had lag spikes,

1148
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,620
but also the people I was playing with on Xbox and PC

1149
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,540
were getting lag spikes, so I think it was their server.

1150
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,580
So it's hard to do a skill check when you have a lag spike.

1151
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:51,940
But overall, I think that Stadia has really made some very good improvements,

1152
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,020
including just their user interface.

1153
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,140
Like, being able to search for the things that you want to buy.

1154
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,540
And I'm paid for Stadia Pro.

1155
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,660
I'm fully down for it.

1156
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:16,020
And then I found that the games that they're putting out for the Pro group

1157
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,060
are actually some pretty fun games.

1158
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:22,980
I've got some, and I own some big titles on there

1159
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,660
that I just flat out paid for,

1160
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,260
because I don't have any other way to play it.

1161
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,740
I'm trying to see some of the ones I have.

1162
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,420
I've got Cyberpunk.

1163
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,820
I have the new Avengers game.

1164
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:42,500
It's just really good.

1165
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,780
Of course, I have Dead by Daylight.

1166
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,380
But I mean, there's also some of those free games that...

1167
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,100
Well, and I say free because I've got the...

1168
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,740
Stadia Pro.

1169
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,220
And there are...

1170
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,140
There's just some stuff I wouldn't have tried before

1171
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,220
that I've actually gotten a chance to try.

1172
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:10,180
Like, I've got a copy of Child of Light.

1173
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,420
I never got to play it.

1174
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,460
I have control of Cthulhu Saves Christmas.

1175
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,580
Doom 64 is on there.

1176
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,780
Okay, so yeah, I know there's plenty of games available on Stadia.

1177
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,620
It's interesting that they're kind of...

1178
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,700
Like you put it, they're finding their stride.

1179
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,180
And I think even in the very beginning,

1180
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:34,580
there were a lot of people that were very interested in,

1181
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:37,300
what can Stadia do for demos, especially?

1182
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,860
Because you don't have to download some gigantic 80 gigabyte...

1183
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,820
How big was that Final Fantasy Strangers in Paradise demo?

1184
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,420
It was something like 80 gigabytes.

1185
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,460
But something like Stadia, you could just jump right in.

1186
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,380
And so it's interesting to see them sort of...

1187
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,180
You know, I don't want to say course correcting,

1188
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,940
but almost like making adjustments and sort of thinking about

1189
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:01,220
how can that element of the trial game or whatever

1190
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,820
be even stronger and building it based off the achievement?

1191
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,260
Because I mean, that makes a lot of sense

1192
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:09,060
is that you want people to take their time through that level

1193
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,060
and not just rush through the first level

1194
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,580
because they're against a timer.

1195
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,780
Or say a two hour clock on Steam refunds

1196
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,060
or whatever the case may be.

1197
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:20,420
So it's also a very interesting flip in the industry.

1198
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,900
And the reason why I say that is because I think about

1199
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,980
back in the Xbox 360 arcade,

1200
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,020
when all releases had to have a demo with it.

1201
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,100
And there were quite a few releases where

1202
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,660
when you got to the end of the first level,

1203
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:33,860
which was the trial,

1204
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,620
the thing would pop up and tell you,

1205
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,380
you just earned an achievement.

1206
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,060
If this was a full game,

1207
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,140
we'd unlock the achievement on your profile,

1208
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,220
press A to go to the store to buy this game

1209
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,980
and unlock the achievement right now.

1210
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,300
It's just, it's interesting that, you know,

1211
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,620
when I think of achievement-based demos,

1212
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,700
I think way back to that.

1213
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,740
But it's interesting how Stadia

1214
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,180
is kind of rewriting this a little bit.

1215
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,420
You know, and-

1216
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,500
And I was also gonna add in,

1217
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,740
I mean, they had really good demos.

1218
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,780
Like they had the Resident Evil Village demo up

1219
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,260
and made it really easy to check out things that were,

1220
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,100
you know, new without,

1221
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,940
especially for me not having a PC,

1222
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,660
it gave me a really solid chance to give it a go.

1223
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,380
I think it's just a matter of time

1224
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,380
before you search for a game

1225
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,700
and it comes right up with try a demo now.

1226
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,740
Now I know to some extent,

1227
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,100
Google kind of already does that

1228
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,460
in like written results and stuff.

1229
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,100
But I mean, like,

1230
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,540
there was a thing just lately on Google,

1231
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,940
I think you search for cats or something

1232
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:43,300
and this whole interactive thing with the cat paws happens.

1233
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,900
You can click and they do that whole thing.

1234
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,660
Like it's really just a matter of time

1235
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:49,460
before you search for Resident Evil 7.

1236
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,020
And sure, the search results come up really tiny on the left,

1237
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,940
but then a big old box pops up on the right

1238
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,500
and there's the demo ready for you to play.

1239
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,300
And I'm gonna put something on cam,

1240
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,460
I hope that people watching at least can see it.

1241
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:05,700
All of this stuff on there is stuff I've claimed for free.

1242
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:07,860
Oh yeah, because of the,

1243
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,980
yeah, it's akin to a PlayStation Plus

1244
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,420
or an Xbox Gold at this point,

1245
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,380
you know, that stuff accumulates.

1246
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,900
Or my Epic Games account.

1247
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:15,940
Oh yeah, that too.

1248
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:20,820
But I mean, the thing is, is that if I had

1249
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,500
my Stadia controller with me,

1250
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:29,700
I could take my iPad and play on my iPad if I wanted to.

1251
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,180
I can play the full Dead by Daylight on my iPad.

1252
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:37,460
So, you know, I think, I honestly think that,

1253
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,540
oh, it stands for the third remastered is on here.

1254
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,660
I'm getting it right now.

1255
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,180
I mean, that's just sort of like how it goes.

1256
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,340
Like I'll see new stuff pop in all the time

1257
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:49,060
and I'll be like, oh heck, I haven't seen this.

1258
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:51,620
Or I didn't even know it was on the platform

1259
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:55,700
and it ends up being pretty, pretty fun.

1260
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,380
You know, I find lots of neat stuff.

1261
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:00,020
I've discovered like that Murder by Numbers game

1262
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,140
that Bobby's fond of.

1263
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,980
I've got it now.

1264
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,780
You know, it's really been,

1265
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,980
I have zero regrets about paying for this service.

1266
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:17,060
And I wish that, I honestly think that this is the way

1267
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,940
things are going to be going is all cloud-based.

1268
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:23,540
I think once 5G is more accessible

1269
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,340
and you can really take your iPad anywhere,

1270
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,580
literally anywhere and play over 5G.

1271
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:32,180
I think that's when cloud gaming really starts to like,

1272
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:35,860
just, you know, go hog, you know?

1273
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,740
Cause right now you still have to get a wifi somewhere.

1274
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:42,260
But I think as over air internet becomes more and more,

1275
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,420
at least in the big cities, you know,

1276
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,860
more and more available.

1277
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:49,620
I absolutely think that type of portable cloud gaming.

1278
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,540
And that's why I think the way Microsoft

1279
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,180
is aligning themselves is very intelligent as well,

1280
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,260
because you know, the Game Pass stuff,

1281
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,020
a vast majority of, I can't say all of it for, you know,

1282
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,060
licensing or whatever it is,

1283
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,620
but a vast majority of it is also just, you know,

1284
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,620
you log in and there you go.

1285
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,540
So it's just, it's interesting.

1286
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:12,180
VO by Kurt in chat, also a Stadia fan saying,

1287
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,460
I had to let my Stadia lapse,

1288
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,220
but I loved it when I had it.

1289
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:18,500
And Bobby Black Wolf reaffirming love for murder by numbers.

1290
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,180
All right.

1291
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,220
Meanwhile, let's go to the record before I forget.

1292
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:23,540
Yeah.

1293
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:26,260
I did find another unicorn in Dead by Daylight

1294
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,700
and that game we're on Stadia.

1295
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:28,980
Really?

1296
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:30,340
I did.

1297
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,140
Who was our killer in our match.

1298
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,180
Oh, how interesting.

1299
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,380
I think it was someone who was new to the killer.

1300
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:38,420
We kind of noticed it.

1301
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,980
So we're like, Hey, here's, here's some stuff.

1302
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,020
I know you haven't played them before.

1303
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,740
And I was just saying, and I was like, yeah.

1304
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,780
I'm uh, and I noticed he had numbers in his name.

1305
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:48,820
I was like, are you on Stadia?

1306
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,700
He's like, yeah, I am.

1307
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,420
And I'm like, well, so am I on a Mac is like,

1308
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,900
I'm on a MacBook pro and I'm like, I'm on a Mac mini.

1309
01:05:55,940 --> 01:06:01,540
So, so it was another unicorn and I've seen other people on Stadia

1310
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,940
who were not on a Mac.

1311
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,220
And then I ran into another one of my people.

1312
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:08,500
Interesting.

1313
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:09,620
All right.

1314
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:10,820
All right.

1315
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,180
We're going to go to our next story.

1316
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,100
Uh, I'm taking a quick restroom break.

1317
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:14,500
Sorry.

1318
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,500
So, um, stretch it out if you have to.

1319
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,140
I'll be right back.

1320
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,580
Don't drown.

1321
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:19,220
I'll try.

1322
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,020
Okay.

1323
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:22,340
All right.

1324
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:31,300
So, um, we talked a little bit about aim junkies and their lawsuit with, um, bungee

1325
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:38,340
right now because of the fact that will aim junkies makes a cheat tools for destiny too.

1326
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:49,140
And so there right now, the situation is that the initial lawsuit, um, the judge actually

1327
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,380
basically dismissed it.

1328
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:59,380
Um, aim that, you know, according to bungees own license agreement that they have to go

1329
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:06,660
through arbitration in order for that to, um, actually, you know, continue on.

1330
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:11,780
And so, um, because of that, you know, they have that chant bungee has to refile the lawsuit,

1331
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,300
which they did earlier this year.

1332
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:21,940
Um, but now of course, um, aim junkies is making claims, or I should say, just, you

1333
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:29,700
know, jabbing them a bit with saying that their, uh, claims of grievous harm are, uh,

1334
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:37,460
full of it, that apparently their con their council believes that, um, you know, more

1335
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:42,340
of the speculative, um, stuff that they're kind of thrown out there, they're just trying

1336
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:45,940
like different angles that basically come after this company.

1337
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:55,060
What the, the argument that aim junkies is trying to make is that basically the months

1338
01:07:55,140 --> 01:08:04,100
where this tool is being used in destiny two were some of the highest months in the game's

1339
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:09,300
history with bungee bungees trying to make the claim, of course, that it caused grievous

1340
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:15,940
harm, and, you know, impacted their sales, or impacted the revenue that they would be

1341
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:19,860
making on destiny two.

1342
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:24,420
So it's going to be interesting to see, um, aim junkies is actually subpoenaed valve,

1343
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,660
PayPal, and bungee to gather some evidence to disprove their claims.

1344
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:34,500
And they're going to try to basically say that, no, it didn't really affect the game at all.

1345
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:41,380
Like, I get what they're trying to say, but the same time, like, I don't think I can side with

1346
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:45,380
a cheat, a cheat software developer for an online game.

1347
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:49,700
You know, it's, it's an interesting thing.

1348
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:55,780
It's a, it's an interesting approach to, you know, try to poke the bear, if you will, basically

1349
01:08:55,780 --> 01:09:03,940
just putting out press releases against destiny two instead of, you know, I don't know, hoping

1350
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:08,020
that you get to look at your ass suit in court, which is probably going to end up happening.

1351
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:08,820
I'm with you.

1352
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:11,700
It's, it's fascinating that this is happening.

1353
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:15,780
I mean, I hope they lose, but it's fascinating that this is even happening in the first place.

1354
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:16,180
You know what I mean?

1355
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:20,580
And I mean, the cheat makers, you know, like profiting off this whole, you know, creating

1356
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,180
misery in an online game and so forth.

1357
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:22,580
I'm sorry.

1358
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,780
I don't have sympathy for the cheat makers in this particular case.

1359
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:26,420
Exactly.

1360
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,340
But it's fascinating what they're doing.

1361
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:33,700
And of course, bungee is going to come in and say it caused harm because,

1362
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,860
Because their lawyers are going to be better.

1363
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,700
That that's how you file a lawsuit.

1364
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:42,420
You have to prove that if they go, well, we're mad at you and we're going to file a lawsuit,

1365
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,820
but it really didn't affect us at all.

1366
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,580
You can't win a lawsuit like that.

1367
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,820
You obviously have to prove that it caused harm.

1368
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,500
And I'm sure that they could do that.

1369
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:55,300
It could be speculative because it could be a higher month, but they could say that, you

1370
01:09:55,300 --> 01:10:01,460
know, because of this many cheaters out there, it caused, you know, players not to spend as much.

1371
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:06,500
I don't know, but like they have it's going to be hard to argue against.

1372
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:14,260
Bungee, but look, yeah, I'm just thinking that bungees lawyers are probably going to be well

1373
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,620
better paid than the lawyers for this aim junkies.

1374
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:22,420
And honestly, based off of the history of, you know, them taking on other cheat makers,

1375
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,860
I don't think you have a shot.

1376
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:26,740
No, I think it's lost cause to Mike Defton.

1377
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,420
Chat says no sympathy for cheaters.

1378
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,940
Yeah, pretty much that part.

1379
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:32,260
Vo by Kurt says, well, they also have to protect their content.

1380
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:37,140
Oh yeah, as far, I mean, I'm sure the bungee lawyers are at the top of their game on this,

1381
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:42,740
but it's just, it's interesting to me that the destiny to cheat makers just didn't try

1382
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:47,860
to like settle in a, we will disappear and never be heard from again kind of way.

1383
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:52,340
But instead they're, they're trying to go out burning their bridges spectacularly,

1384
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:57,620
which may result in financial penalties against them in a civil case.

1385
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,740
And that's just kind of surprising to me that they, they want to go that hard.

1386
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,340
Well, and they don't even have to necessarily prove, I think, damages.

1387
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:09,220
They can, they can prove that they violated copyright and they could just, you know,

1388
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:10,980
take that route.

1389
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:11,780
I don't know.

1390
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:12,660
I think they're gonna lose.

1391
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:14,900
I know they're going to lose.

1392
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:15,380
I don't.

1393
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,140
I mean, yeah, that's a given, but yeah.

1394
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:20,980
But it's fascinating that they're trying.

1395
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:25,140
I mean, you have to look at them like you kind of want to go, yeah, you love to see

1396
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:28,580
somebody fighting the big, bad companies, but then not like this.

1397
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,860
Yeah, not like this.

1398
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:32,180
It's like, no, I'm not going to root for the cheater.

1399
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:35,380
And Bungie is actually, Bungie's okay.

1400
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,620
Like I, like, especially compared to a lot of their peers right now.

1401
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:40,020
What would be the precedent that would be set by this?

1402
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:42,740
Like if they won't, you know, it's like, oh, okay, cool.

1403
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:45,380
We're just going to have cheat programs all over the place.

1404
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:48,180
Hey, all that online content you like playing stuff.

1405
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,020
Well, it's just going to be ruined by everybody.

1406
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:50,980
So, Hey, cool.

1407
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:51,620
Yeah.

1408
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:55,060
You're just looking at the destiny to cheat makers going, wow, they're doing that.

1409
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,700
They're, they're, they're really doing that.

1410
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,100
They're, they're arguing to be like, well, you know what?

1411
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:03,940
You just have to cheat even harder, you know, it's back and forth.

1412
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,420
All right.

1413
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,300
Moving on.

1414
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:11,060
Let's talk about something that Jason was making fun of in the intro tonight.

1415
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,300
It's the announcement of an announcement.

1416
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:13,780
That's right.

1417
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:19,940
There is a Sunsoft digital event that is set for August 18th where the company will be

1418
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:23,860
talking about upcoming titles for 2022 and 2023.

1419
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:26,660
And it'll be on YouTube and a press release.

1420
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:31,540
Yuichi Ochi said, although we've been quiet for some times, many things have been happening

1421
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,820
behind the scenes.

1422
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:38,580
We are very excited to be able to finally share our vision for the rebirth of Sunsoft

1423
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,340
with fans old and new.

1424
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,340
So interesting.

1425
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:47,380
Now it might be worth looking into what they say in the press release.

1426
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,820
What Sunsoft is all about.

1427
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:53,620
They were established in 1971 as a part of Sun corporation.

1428
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:58,260
And in 1978, they began to make video games and arcades with block challenger and block

1429
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:58,820
perfect.

1430
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:05,860
In the early 1980s, some of their early hits were Arabian, Icky, and Kangaroo.

1431
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:12,740
On July 25th, they released the first NES Famicom title in Japan under Sunsoft brands

1432
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,180
called Super Arabian.

1433
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:20,260
And Sunsoft, of course, probably best known for their retro development, including Gimmick,

1434
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:27,620
Blaster Master, Spy Hunter, Batman, Trip World, Euphoria the Saga, and much more.

1435
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:31,780
That much more, including Fester's Quest, which I didn't see named in that press release.

1436
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,780
I guess we're not getting a new one of those.

1437
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,900
That's unfortunate.

1438
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:42,660
So going in chat, Digirama S says, OMG Sunsoft, Journey to Silius 2, please.

1439
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,660
Anything's possible, right?

1440
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:47,300
Mike Deff says, how about a new Kangaroo game?

1441
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,340
Give me that, please.

1442
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:53,220
Hey, retro archives are all the rage right now.

1443
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:58,820
Why not a repackaging of some of those arcade hits in some type of arcade package?

1444
01:13:58,820 --> 01:13:59,460
Who knows?

1445
01:13:59,460 --> 01:13:59,940
Who knows?

1446
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:00,500
You know what?

1447
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:00,980
Hmm.

1448
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:01,540
You know what?

1449
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:07,460
So like, you know, they started their company with some great arcade games, block challenger

1450
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:08,900
and block perfect.

1451
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,420
Now it's time to take a look at that.

1452
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:13,140
Loki has been dismissed from Orange Lounge Radio.

1453
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:18,260
I'm very sorry to say, please look forward to our next episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

1454
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:20,900
where we will be replacing Loki with a ferret.

1455
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:21,460
Thank you.

1456
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:21,960
Good night.

1457
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,220
I hope it's something good.

1458
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,060
I mean, like, they're the games that they've made.

1459
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,740
Like, Batman was great.

1460
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:31,140
Like, all their NES games are great.

1461
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:34,100
So I'd be curious to see what they're going to do.

1462
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,700
Hopefully, they're going to be able to do that.

1463
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,140
I mean, they're going to be able to do that.

1464
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:40,020
So I'd be curious to see what they're going to do.

1465
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:43,060
Hopefully not sequels to, like, really old games, because, like, I don't know.

1466
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:44,820
I want to see new stuff.

1467
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:52,980
Ashima Panic in our chat says that's what I thought to myself, too, as far as the blockchain

1468
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:53,540
stuff goes, too.

1469
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,820
And I pray it won't be.

1470
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,220
You know what?

1471
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:58,740
It's a very cynical but very realistic approach to that whole thing.

1472
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,540
Ashima Panic also says Fester's Quest is the surprise.

1473
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,660
I wish, I wish.

1474
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:07,780
But as some folks in chat are saying, you know, those types of licenses, they don't

1475
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,140
really have those licenses.

1476
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:13,300
Now, as Joe and Hannah-Matt says, down for another Blaster Master game, honestly.

1477
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:20,340
Don't forget, we've had very recently those Blaster Master reboot games that were really

1478
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:20,740
good.

1479
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,740
Inti Creates did them.

1480
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:26,180
Blaster Master, was it Zero Mission?

1481
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,620
I can't, no, that's Metroid.

1482
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:31,700
I don't, there was a Blaster Master, but they did a whole trilogy.

1483
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:36,580
And two and three had nothing to do with, like, they were just kind of like original

1484
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:40,180
games that were done in the same vein as that first game.

1485
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,020
Blaster Master Zero, that was it.

1486
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:45,700
But that first game was actually a beautiful reboot.

1487
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:46,980
Like, I loved it.

1488
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:52,340
It was way better than the one that was done on the Wii, which unfortunately I think was

1489
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,780
a Sunsoft endorsed thing.

1490
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:59,540
But yeah, that one that Inti Creates, I believe, put together is great.

1491
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:03,940
I just don't think there's room for Sunsoft to do anything else on top of that, quite

1492
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:04,660
honestly.

1493
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:10,100
I'm trying to think of, like, because, you know, I think Sunsoft's done a lot of shooters

1494
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:16,260
in Japan, so that's probably something that, you know, they may be doing as well as rebooting

1495
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:16,820
some of those.

1496
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,900
They might not be as well known over here.

1497
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:22,820
But I'm looking at some of the list of video games that they've developed in the past.

1498
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:29,460
Interestingly enough, yeah, they're credited for Fantasy Zone, actually, but they did the

1499
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,260
NES port.

1500
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:31,780
But see, again, that's not their game.

1501
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,580
That's Sega's game.

1502
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,820
So they can't just say, oh, we're going to make a new one of those.

1503
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:37,540
Well, the NES port was questionable at that.

1504
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,300
Yeah, let's see.

1505
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:44,820
They actually were the ones that did the Final Fantasy Legend games, but they were rereleases

1506
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:48,100
and kind of like, you know, they were, you know, translated.

1507
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:51,780
But some folks in chat pointed this out.

1508
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:57,380
Some of their most recent releases were Clock Tower games.

1509
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:03,300
So they did Clock Tower the First Fear, Clock Tower 2, and Clock Tower Ghost Head were some

1510
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:08,260
of the last things that they did in 2012 before a really big break.

1511
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:11,860
So I wonder if maybe a Clock Tower reboot isn't something.

1512
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:17,300
That is one that I think that's probably the most likely thing is a Clock Tower reboot.

1513
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,180
But we'll see.

1514
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,780
I think that could be kind of cool.

1515
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,140
Clock Tower characters for Dead by Daylight.

1516
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:24,580
Who knows?

1517
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:26,420
Oh, my God.

1518
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,740
If they put that scissor guy in Dead by Daylight, I'm quitting.

1519
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:31,700
I can't handle it.

1520
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,460
I cannot handle Scissorman.

1521
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:34,660
And I can't handle it.

1522
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:35,220
I'll quit.

1523
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:35,620
I will.

1524
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,140
Too scary.

1525
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:40,740
All right.

1526
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,420
Anyway, thank you to everybody, by the way, in chat.

1527
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:49,460
Literally three different clips of Loki getting fired here tonight on the show for a blockchain

1528
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:49,780
joke.

1529
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:50,180
Love it.

1530
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:53,940
Thank you all.

1531
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,260
All right.

1532
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:57,540
That's true.

1533
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:01,780
Orange right in chat says, guessing Rob isn't going for Team Scissors after all, I guess.

1534
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:02,980
You make a good point.

1535
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:04,340
I have to switch to Team Paper.

1536
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,100
All right.

1537
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,860
Anyhow, let's move on.

1538
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:11,940
And Dark Sakura bringing back the classics.

1539
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:12,340
Why not?

1540
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:14,260
Let's bring back another horror classic tonight.

1541
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:15,700
What we do.

1542
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:21,140
So eight years ago, PT was delisted.

1543
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:26,260
And the person who had to do the delisting has actually spoken out.

1544
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:35,780
It was also the same person, though, who worked to have it listed.

1545
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:46,260
So the former Konami staffer named Pearl actually had a few things to say about it on Twitter.

1546
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:53,300
And Kojima actually acknowledged the eight-year anniversary after these statements came out.

1547
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,100
So it was pretty cool.

1548
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:59,620
But at any rate, some of the posts went along these lines.

1549
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:05,300
A fun fact, since I was the lead at the time at Konami, I helped get this product set up

1550
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:08,340
on the storefronts, fake publisher, and everything.

1551
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:13,780
And I was the one who had to call Sony and ask them to take it down and block redownloads.

1552
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:15,620
That was a super fun conversation.

1553
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:23,460
And then, as for people who are asking, you know, why her response was,

1554
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,860
I say this with love because Konami.

1555
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,660
How many times have we said this?

1556
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:31,700
You know, what's interesting?

1557
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,220
I know this individual.

1558
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:35,940
I don't know.

1559
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:40,740
I think maybe we met once a while ago, but we definitely have mutual friends in common,

1560
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:44,100
because if you think about where friends of ours used to work, they were friends.

1561
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:47,940
Where friends of ours used to work many years ago, she also worked there.

1562
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:51,540
I feel bad for her that she's becoming a main character because of this story.

1563
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,820
And I know she's locked her Twitter down since then.

1564
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:57,780
And honestly, I don't think she's did anything wrong here.

1565
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,620
You know, this is, again, it's eight years ago.

1566
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:04,580
She's not the one that pushed, I mean, okay, maybe she figuratively pushed the button,

1567
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,100
but it wasn't her call.

1568
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,540
She's just, that was her job.

1569
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:12,180
She was the liaison between Konami and Sony and had to have these tough conversations

1570
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,020
because of what someone else wanted to do.

1571
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:17,860
So I actually feel bad for her that now, because she's kind of looking back and having

1572
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:23,060
a laugh at this all this time later, that now she's like, this story has just caught

1573
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:28,020
wildfire and she's had to lock down her Twitter because she's, you know, a completely

1574
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,700
normal person with an interesting job in her past.

1575
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:36,020
And it's just, I feel bad that everybody's scrutinizing this and all this stuff.

1576
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:37,460
Yeah, going to chat.

1577
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:40,260
Mike Defton chat says, yeah, she was following orders.

1578
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,140
I can't blame her.

1579
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:46,260
SSJ100Matt says our own Flaco Jones had the world record speed run for PT for a little

1580
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:46,980
bit though.

1581
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:49,300
Mike Deft says I can blame Konami though.

1582
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,180
Fuck Konami.

1583
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:51,860
Yes, you can blame Konami in this.

1584
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:55,620
And I feel bad because I wonder if Konami didn't send a nasty gram over.

1585
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:56,180
I mean, I don't know.

1586
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,460
I'm making shit up.

1587
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:01,060
Maybe she was just getting tagged at a lot of tweets and she went, you know, on lockdown

1588
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,180
for that reason.

1589
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:08,260
But I can't help but wonder if Konami didn't say something, which would be ridiculous.

1590
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,620
The entire world knows.

1591
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,380
But it would be totally in character.

1592
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,380
That's what I'm worried about.

1593
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,140
There's more that I had to say though.

1594
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:15,780
Okay, please.

1595
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:17,160
Okay.

1596
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:24,500
Just to go back though to the comments on it, because that's really, you know, the first

1597
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:29,940
and foremost thing about it is that she went on to say that it was a really awkward situation

1598
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:34,660
and that they had to go through all of these hoops to get it set up.

1599
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:39,060
Lots of operational exceptions, she said.

1600
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:44,180
And then to send the request in to block it, more engineering workarounds, I'm quoting

1601
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:44,660
now.

1602
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:49,540
It was exciting to see people hype about it and see the work pay off, but in a way also

1603
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:50,040
not.

1604
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:56,020
And the other comment made, believe me, I wish it had gone different too.

1605
01:21:56,020 --> 01:22:00,580
It was definitely really funny to be plotting the secret cool thing for the fans.

1606
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:06,100
It was amazing to see everyone come together to try to figure out the experience and see

1607
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:08,100
them come away with so much love for it.

1608
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,900
I'm super grateful I got to be a part of that in some small way.

1609
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:16,740
So I don't see any flippancy about anything in her comments.

1610
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:22,020
She was like, I was really proud of this and then it was really awful to have to take it

1611
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:22,520
down.

1612
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:27,780
I think it's very matter of fact and very transparent.

1613
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,140
It's an element of transparency.

1614
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,860
We never get out of Konami.

1615
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:36,900
And that is why, unfortunately, she has found herself now everywhere this week is that she's

1616
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,420
giving us an element of transparency.

1617
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:39,700
We never get out of Konami.

1618
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:43,620
So and technically we're not getting it out of Konami.

1619
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,180
That's right.

1620
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:46,180
You know, she's somewhere else now.

1621
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:46,820
Yeah.

1622
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:52,260
So it's waiting for NDAs and whatnot to have worn off before she could say something about

1623
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:52,760
it.

1624
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:58,260
I just also my other advice, not that, you know, Pearl should give a hoot what I think,

1625
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:05,700
but my other advice would be clearly you could put this in a book and sell it, like put

1626
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:06,820
it in a book and sell it.

1627
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,340
Don't give it away for free on Twitter.

1628
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:12,100
I doubt that this is going to be enough material to fill a book.

1629
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,980
Oh, I bet.

1630
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:19,460
But from the inner workings of Konami, I bet there is plenty to fill a book.

1631
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:21,300
This is just one chapter, my friend.

1632
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:26,580
I can tell you that only really a handful of people would buy that book.

1633
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,100
I'm serious.

1634
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,740
But look, look at where this story is.

1635
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,220
I mean, it's catching a lot of places this week.

1636
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:41,140
I think there's a lot of people, I think, that are interested in what the fuck happened

1637
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:41,860
to Konami.

1638
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,140
Like what?

1639
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:47,060
Because we still don't really have an answer to that question.

1640
01:23:47,060 --> 01:24:00,180
I can also tell you that there are absolutely full videos online in terms of like 30 minutes

1641
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:01,220
to over an hour.

1642
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:02,500
True.

1643
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,980
Going through a lot of that already for free.

1644
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:10,580
I think the things that would have been said, hers is just like the last, the last nail.

1645
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:15,540
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I know Kojima would never write it because he's a classy

1646
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:18,980
guy, but I would read his book about the final years with Konami.

1647
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:24,900
Well, Kojima should get his BFF to write the book because his BFF writes plenty of books

1648
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,220
about the last days of game development projects.

1649
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:28,580
So just food for thought.

1650
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:31,540
And of course, I'm talking about Jeff Keighley, so food for thought.

1651
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:36,500
But I do understand these are niche things for sure, but interesting.

1652
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:44,260
At the same time, though, there was a really good video I watched maybe about a couple

1653
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:48,420
years ago that really went in depth.

1654
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:54,340
Some of it was very speculatory, but it had plenty of evidence to back it up about exactly

1655
01:24:54,340 --> 01:25:01,300
what might have gone down and the prelude to Kojima's leaving.

1656
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,340
It went a lot into history and I thought it was really good.

1657
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:07,940
If I can find it again, I will absolutely share it with everybody.

1658
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:13,700
Well, it's interesting that one person that does not hold back in discussing Konami is

1659
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:19,300
Guillermo del Toro, who in a tweet simply wrote about this whole thing, simply wrote

1660
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:23,780
F K and to stand for fuck Konami.

1661
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:28,980
He does not make his stance on Konami very secret.

1662
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,860
So anyway, all right.

1663
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:37,060
I think I also I can applaud Guillermo del Toro for taking a sentiment and just shortening

1664
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:38,740
it to two simple letters.

1665
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:39,780
Two simple letters.

1666
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,100
All right.

1667
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,540
Anyhow, let's move on.

1668
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,700
We have some more stories.

1669
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:50,180
Two simple companies slinging words back and forth.

1670
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:50,740
Right, Loki?

1671
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:54,500
Yes, it's like it's just never ends.

1672
01:25:54,500 --> 01:26:00,580
So we talked about last week, I think, where Sony had made the argument that, you know,

1673
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:04,980
Call of Duty was this big franchise and they're trying to block the whole merger with Activision

1674
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,100
and stuff like that.

1675
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:11,380
Well, now Microsoft is accusing Sony of blocking games from being added to Games Pass.

1676
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:20,180
They're saying that apparently I think this may even go back to the whole Call of Duty

1677
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:27,540
stuff as well, but apparently Microsoft has been trying to convince the different agencies

1678
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:29,620
that they can't shouldn't be acquiring them.

1679
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:34,820
Microsoft's ability to continue expanding Games Pass has been hampered by the Sony's

1680
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:36,500
desire to inhibit such growth.

1681
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:43,140
Sony pays for blocking rights to prevent developers from adding content to Games Pass and other

1682
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,820
competing services, they claim.

1683
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:52,340
And then to throw a little bit more shade on Sony, Microsoft, you know, I guess Sony

1684
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:56,420
was arguing that their their service is not doing as well.

1685
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:02,100
And so Microsoft made a basically I don't know if it's like a PowerPoint.

1686
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,700
I want to imagine it's a PowerPoint.

1687
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,620
It's Microsoft.

1688
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:10,100
They're not going to do it in whatever the competitors are.

1689
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:14,820
Some document, of course, that they said, well, here's how you can make your PlayStation

1690
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:15,540
plus better.

1691
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,980
They provided their information to them.

1692
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:24,180
So, yeah, it's I don't know.

1693
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:28,660
Yeah, they have a 27 page document that they provided, so.

1694
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:31,860
Interesting, all the shade.

1695
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:37,380
Yeah, and also interesting how this whole Microsoft merger thing is playing out in these

1696
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:40,100
different documents and so forth and the arguments that are being made.

1697
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:46,740
I think my favorite was the one about like Microsoft saying that like Activision Blizzard

1698
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:49,700
is that they aren't making anything that's like a must have.

1699
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:53,540
They aren't making anything that good, which is wild to me that they would say that about

1700
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:54,900
a company they're buying.

1701
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:59,860
But like I also get from a completely legal, legal, strategical perspective, they have

1702
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:00,340
to say that.

1703
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:02,660
And what's what's one thing?

1704
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:07,140
At least I know I've always said about Blizzard and, you know, in the past, before all this

1705
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:11,460
drama, llama stuff in the past few years and Bobby Kotick's mismanagement, all this stuff.

1706
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:18,260
One thing that Blizzard has always historically done incredibly well is taking a genre of

1707
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:24,340
game and making it more accessible to a wider audience like Overwatch and Team Fortress

1708
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:33,700
2, like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone, like EverQuest and World of Warcraft, etc.,

1709
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:34,580
etc.

1710
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:39,700
Blizzard is very good at this, and that's how they've made their bucks over the years.

1711
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:43,380
And so it's interesting to me that like, you know, Microsoft's whole stance, you know,

1712
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:47,620
is, well, they're not making you know, they're just making games in the same genre or what

1713
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:49,780
it's just it's so wild to me.

1714
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:52,580
But but legally, it's the smart play.

1715
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:53,160
Yeah.

1716
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:54,200
Yeah.

1717
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:58,980
Anyway, why don't they just say that, like, you know, Bobby Kotick's kind of driven the

1718
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:01,060
country or driven to the country?

1719
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:05,940
Well, in some ways, yes, but the company into the ground and it's not worth as much because

1720
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:06,740
of his sorry ass.

1721
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:09,460
But I guess legally, there might be some issues with that.

1722
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:10,680
Oh, well.

1723
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:16,180
Anyway, let's move on to one more story before we take a trip down memory lane in the classic

1724
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:16,900
game of the week.

1725
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:24,260
And I wish this was not a story that I feel like we're reporting on way too frequently,

1726
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:28,740
but I feel like this this whole issue just even escalated this week.

1727
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:30,500
Made me sick.

1728
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,020
Yeah, it really made me sick.

1729
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:32,820
It's gross.

1730
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:39,380
But, you know, we if if we don't say things about it and express that change needs to

1731
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,700
happen, change needs to happen.

1732
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:48,980
Um, so Clara Sorrente, who goes by keffles online, I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

1733
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:49,620
I'm very sorry.

1734
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:54,260
I admit I did not know this individual until I read this report, but I don't follow a lot

1735
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,820
of the large popular streamers.

1736
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,100
That's not me being edgy.

1737
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,540
That's just me being honest.

1738
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:05,780
So anyway, Clara Sorrente is a trans streamer and a political commentator and was arrested

1739
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:07,380
by Canadian police.

1740
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:09,060
And I want to make sure that's clear.

1741
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:14,420
This is now a problem that's not unique to the US because there's already been going

1742
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:15,220
on, though.

1743
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:15,780
Oh, yeah, no.

1744
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:18,100
And I'm not trying to say, oh, it doesn't happen in the US.

1745
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,100
I'm just saying this is a large problem.

1746
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:29,140
She was arrested by Canadian police after a swatting incident, and she put out a YouTube

1747
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:33,620
video where she recounted what happened, saying that the police locked her out of her accounts

1748
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:37,700
because she's still a suspect in this investigation of a made up fucking crime.

1749
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,420
Like, wild.

1750
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:40,920
Anything.

1751
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:42,980
It's not just her.

1752
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:44,980
It's her fiance's computer, too.

1753
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:46,260
All his stuff.

1754
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:53,300
Anyway, she uses her platform for Activision, like calling awareness to a California bill

1755
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:56,340
that would protect trans youth that are fleeing the state.

1756
01:30:56,340 --> 01:31:02,180
And gosh, I wonder why someone would want to target her, which makes me sick to say.

1757
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:04,660
But it's the quiet part out loud.

1758
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:05,620
And it's sad.

1759
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,860
And it's sad that it worked.

1760
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,460
It's really sad that it worked.

1761
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:16,820
The morning of Friday, August 5th, she was woken up by London police services that went

1762
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:18,340
into her home with an assault rifle.

1763
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:25,300
Somebody impersonating her emailed every city councilor in London, Ontario, saying that

1764
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:30,340
she had committed murder, had a firearm and planned to go to City Hall and shoot every

1765
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:31,380
cisgender person.

1766
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:35,540
And it was signed under her dead name.

1767
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:37,700
Yeah, and that's another.

1768
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,860
What trans person dead names themselves?

1769
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:44,420
Like, there are so many red flags here.

1770
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:49,860
It's just, it's, yeah.

1771
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,000
Anyway.

1772
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:55,780
I donated to the GoFundMe for the record.

1773
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:56,660
Oh, there's a GoFundMe?

1774
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:57,220
I didn't know that.

1775
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:02,100
Yeah, it's actually linked on your article.

1776
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:06,020
Oh, yes, it sure is.

1777
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:10,980
So if you actually search for her name, Clara Sorrente, or you can search for the Twitch

1778
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:15,220
name, Kefles, it's a moving legal fund that's available on GoFundMe.

1779
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:22,100
Also, it's pointed out that the Kefles is not the only streamer that is still having

1780
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,460
these types of problems.

1781
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:29,140
A Grand Theft Auto 5 streamer named Aiden Ross, another internet personality named

1782
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:31,860
iShowSpeed also had SWAT issues.

1783
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:36,020
A Hearthstone streamer had the cops invade her home on a live stream in February.

1784
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:41,460
Where's the fucking end of this?

1785
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:48,820
Like, this is still ongoing, not just nationwide, but worldwide.

1786
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:51,780
And this continues to be a problem.

1787
01:32:51,780 --> 01:33:00,660
And I really like the part that just is that the basic fact finding education on behalf

1788
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:05,780
of the London, Ontario police and these huge red flags we already pointed out about the

1789
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:10,820
dead naming and some of the ludicrous things that were said and of the level of the seriousness

1790
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:17,700
that they were taking is just like, this should be 101 type of stuff on how to spot a fake.

1791
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:22,340
And I understand that you have to take everything seriously.

1792
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:25,300
But you don't have to go to this extent.

1793
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:29,060
I hope she sues and I hope she wins.

1794
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:31,380
I don't know to what extent she can do that in Canada.

1795
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:34,980
I'm not familiar enough with the laws and so forth, you know, and I understand it's

1796
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:39,140
not as civil lawsuit friendly of a culture as it is here.

1797
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,100
But I hope she sues and I hope she wins.

1798
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:44,900
Maybe the money will do the talking.

1799
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:55,460
This is why I'm a big fan of, like, don't use your, your, your birth date in your passwords,

1800
01:33:55,460 --> 01:34:02,260
don't, you know, don't do those little memes online, where, oh, put in your full initials

1801
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:04,660
and do this or put in your date of birth and do this.

1802
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:07,060
Now, thankfully, all of my passwords are in another language.

1803
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:16,420
Um, but, uh, you know, it's telling people exactly where you live, you know, that's why

1804
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:21,700
my last name is nowhere out there on the internet, unless it's like for something official.

1805
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:22,200
Yeah.

1806
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:27,780
You know, it's, you got to take steps to, to, I mean, it sucks.

1807
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,900
You do have to take steps to protect yourself.

1808
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:37,220
You know, you can, like, if you're on your social media or doing posts there, do it through

1809
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:38,580
a VPN, for example.

1810
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:48,420
You know, um, remember when I got like that series of harassing, uh, messages and I tracked

1811
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:52,020
down their VPN, listed the address and said exactly who it was.

1812
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:55,860
It was what's his face, his friend back in the day.

1813
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,020
Oh, the one, the one that stalked me?

1814
01:34:58,420 --> 01:34:59,380
No, no, no, no.

1815
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:02,420
It was, um, what was his name?

1816
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:09,060
Oh, oh, I don't even want to dig, I don't want to dignify it with the name, but yeah,

1817
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:09,620
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1818
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,500
One of his friends.

1819
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,000
Yeah.

1820
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:17,300
And I basically was like, um, I just found your address in Granite Bay.

1821
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:18,740
Do you want me to post it publicly?

1822
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:22,340
Like, oh no, no, no, no.

1823
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:23,060
I apologize.

1824
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:24,740
It wasn't, uh, I'm like, whatever.

1825
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:27,220
But it is that easy.

1826
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:35,300
I mean, granted, it was maybe easier 10 years ago, but it's still fairly easy.

1827
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:40,180
I mean, so like for the biggest ways that you can protect yourself, even though you

1828
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:46,260
should not have to is, you know, never give out any of your personal information online.

1829
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:51,780
Don't use your real name, uh, for your usernames, uh, look into a VPN.

1830
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:52,820
Look into a VPN.

1831
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:57,460
There is an anti-swatting registry in some states.

1832
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,220
Um, so look for that.

1833
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:09,620
And there's also, um, uh, some other, uh, legal counsel that might be, you know, out

1834
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:10,580
there in your area.

1835
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:18,180
But, um, but there are, uh, um, some anti-swatting resources out there that you can look into.

1836
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:23,300
And I would, I would suggest, you know, if you feel so inclined, you might want to consider,

1837
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:26,500
uh, uh, uh, donation on that GoFundMe.

1838
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,700
They're so close to the goal.

1839
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:30,980
All right.

1840
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:37,380
But I mean, we've had people get 20-year prison sentences for, uh, swatting.

1841
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,380
Yeah, they're not enough.

1842
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:39,860
Not enough.

1843
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:40,900
Different state.

1844
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:41,140
Yeah.

1845
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:50,660
You know, so it's, uh, but in a lot of states, it's, if no one dies from it, it's typically

1846
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:53,300
considered, uh, aggravated harassment.

1847
01:36:54,100 --> 01:37:00,660
Although in California, though, uh, you, uh, if you swat somebody and you're, you're caught,

1848
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:05,540
then you have to pay for the full cost of the swat or tactical response team.

1849
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:05,940
Good.

1850
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:07,700
Which is, can be upwards of $10,000.

1851
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:08,740
Good.

1852
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:09,300
Good.

1853
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:13,140
Honestly, if, and if that ever happened to me, I'd file a civil lawsuit so fast, your

1854
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:13,700
head would spin.

1855
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:19,940
And in New York, um, you can be charged with murder if a hoax ends in death.

1856
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:22,100
All right.

1857
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:26,900
So I just wanted to throw that out there because I think people need to know their own resources,

1858
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:29,780
how to protect themselves as well as yeah.

1859
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:33,620
And it, and it's just one of those things where like, I, I, I take no joy in talking

1860
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:35,860
about this, but it's important to highlight.

1861
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:43,060
This is still happening and police departments everywhere, not just the U S everywhere, say

1862
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:47,700
what you will about the police in the U S this didn't happen in the U S police departments

1863
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:56,420
everywhere needs some basic education, basic education on how to spot this stuff.

1864
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:57,140
Like it just.

1865
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:05,060
I, my own point though, with, uh, the London, Ontario police is that they dead named this

1866
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:13,060
woman continued to, and are doing all this, even though Toronto police, you know, dismissed

1867
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:15,460
it outright and didn't charge anything.

1868
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:16,900
And we're, we're good to her.

1869
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:22,820
I'm also seeing this as trans harassment by a public facility.

1870
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:23,220
For sure.

1871
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:24,680
Yeah.

1872
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:30,980
So she's got a suit and there will be people who will back her up.

1873
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:31,220
Yeah.

1874
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:33,940
And again, I can't claim to know how Canada courts work.

1875
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:38,980
I barely understand it here, but I, if there's any chance that she can go for civil recourse

1876
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:44,100
from the police department, she absolutely, absolutely, absolutely ought to do it.

1877
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:44,820
Absolutely.

1878
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:47,140
All right.

1879
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:52,580
Let's go back to a simpler time when you know, you know what a crank, you know what a prank

1880
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:55,300
was calling someone and hanging up the phone.

1881
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,940
That's that was, that was the extent of a prank.

1882
01:38:57,940 --> 01:39:02,900
Let's go back to a simpler time as we take a trip down, go catch it.

1883
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:18,740
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler California where I'll dive into the vault

1884
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:21,460
and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1885
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:24,100
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1886
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:27,700
All right.

1887
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:30,340
And dark soccer, what did you pick for us this week?

1888
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:39,460
I picked Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc because, oh, I just hurt myself a minute ago.

1889
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:48,340
I, uh, I love Danganronpa and I didn't realize that it was as old as it was until I saw that

1890
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:50,260
the sequel was 10 years old.

1891
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,980
So I decided to go with the first one.

1892
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:54,340
I'm surprised I haven't done it.

1893
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:59,140
And, and, you know, Shane is also a fellow Danganronpa fan.

1894
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:08,980
Um, so at any rate, uh, Danganronpa is, uh, um, actually no Danganronpa 2 turned 10.

1895
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:14,020
The first Danganronpa is, uh, it came out in 2010.

1896
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:24,420
So, uh, but anyway, um, it is a visual novel adventure that was published by Spike and

1897
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:26,580
it is the first in the Danganronpa series.

1898
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:34,100
Um, it was released in Japan for, uh, the PS portable in, on November, 2010, later ported

1899
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:43,220
to iOS and Android in August, 2012, localized and published in English, uh, by NIS America

1900
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,500
for multiple platforms.

1901
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:53,060
Um, so, uh, at any rate, um, you play a character named Naegi Makoto.

1902
01:40:53,220 --> 01:41:02,340
Um, and, uh, basically you're sort of in this battle royale situation, sort of, kinda, um,

1903
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:08,500
he's considered to be the ultimate lucky student because his name got pulled at random to join

1904
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:14,500
this school called Hope's Peak Academy, where everybody else is sort of like this ultimate

1905
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:14,980
student.

1906
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:28,580
Um, and so, uh, he gets, he, he goes into the school and wakes up with no memory of

1907
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:34,180
how he got there or what's happened, just that he's stuck in, in the school with other

1908
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:38,900
students who also were in the same situation, except for one who does not remember what

1909
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:39,860
her specialty is.

1910
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:44,100
Um, and she's also like probably my favorite character.

1911
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:52,020
Uh, but at any rate, um, the game plays out very, very interestingly.

1912
01:41:52,820 --> 01:42:03,620
Um, so you find out that you are locked in the school, uh, by looks by this little half

1913
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:06,020
black, half white bear named Monokuma.

1914
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:10,420
Um, you know, as in monochrome bear, Kuma means bear.

1915
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:19,380
Um, so Monokuma in order to cause ultimate despair, and I'm, I'm really trying not to

1916
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:23,060
spoil it since now we've got people like, uh, Ramus is going to try to give it a play.

1917
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:31,300
Um, but, uh, for all intents and purposes, it seems like it's Monokuma or whoever's controlling

1918
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:41,380
Monokuma, um, has having all the students, uh, basically kill somebody and either there's

1919
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:47,140
one person left or they keep, you know, finding out who did it.

1920
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:56,580
So when, when the character, when the character dies, you have to, um, gather evidence and

1921
01:42:56,580 --> 01:43:02,420
then you have a class trial and you've got like, uh, like truth bullet events.

1922
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:05,700
I think if I'm right, I think Danganronpa like means truth bullet.

1923
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:07,300
I'll have to look it up again.

1924
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:10,260
Um, but you also have to argue your case.

1925
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:15,860
You kind of have some, uh, uh, like ace attorney elements in it.

1926
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:22,420
Um, very similar to that with the investigation and finding contradictions and, but it's a

1927
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:24,100
much faster gameplay style.

1928
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:26,980
And you can have like a rhythm game element in it too.

1929
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:36,820
Um, but the way that it goes though, is that if, if you figure out who the killer is, then

1930
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:42,660
you, um, they get executed pretty gruesomely yet stylistically.

1931
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:50,340
Um, and if you don't get the right person, then all the other students get executed and

1932
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:51,460
the killer goes free.

1933
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:59,700
Um, and so as you go through more and more of these, you know, you have your school life

1934
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:04,980
mode where you can go around and talk to people and learn from them until a murder is discovered.

1935
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:13,220
Um, there's even some kind of, um, like dating sim elements to it as well.

1936
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:14,740
Like you react to different things.

1937
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:16,500
You've got your free time segments.

1938
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:22,340
Um, you can also find like, uh, hidden items throughout the game for extra stuff.

1939
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:25,540
Um, but the big thing is looking for the clues.

1940
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:30,580
Um, and you've also got your e-handbook, which is also where you can save your game.

1941
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:38,260
Um, but once you have all of the evidence, so when you found every piece of it, um, I,

1942
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:41,060
we have an ad playing.

1943
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:43,860
Oh, sorry.

1944
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:45,300
Oh, sorry.

1945
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:52,900
I, yeah, I, I never noticed any of that cause I, I pay for my account.

1946
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:55,940
Um, but anyway, pay for mine.

1947
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:57,700
No, thank you.

1948
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:05,140
Um, but at any rate, um, you know, all of these students are like that, that you have

1949
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:12,020
are like, like the character on screen, um, uh, Leon is like the, the ultimate baseball

1950
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,380
player.

1951
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:21,940
Um, uh, uh, I'm trying to think of who others, uh, you know, we have the ultimate computer

1952
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:29,460
program or the ultimate pop star, you know, the ultimate, uh, mangaka, you know, so, or

1953
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:35,700
doujinshi artists, I should say, who was also by the way, voiced by, uh, uh, Yamaguchi Kappe,

1954
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:37,300
who was also Ranma, just saying.

1955
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:41,620
Um, but any rate, uh, cause I never played it in English.

1956
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:42,740
I only put it in Japanese.

1957
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:50,340
Um, so, uh, uh, at any rate, um, you know, so you go through the game, you uncover more

1958
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:58,500
and more of the story and you learn a lot more about what's going on in the game.

1959
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:05,540
Um, you play as Makoto and the, the girl I was talking to, uh, who was made to forget

1960
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:12,020
what her specialty is, is, uh, Kirigiri Kyoko, who Kyoko is like, she stayed my favorite

1961
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:12,420
character.

1962
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:22,820
Um, um, but, uh, you also, uh, work with her quite a bit and she's got very keen observational

1963
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:23,780
skills.

1964
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:29,060
Um, you also find out quite a bit more about her and her connection to the whole thing.

1965
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:37,540
Um, but going now back into some of the development, cause the development actually has to do,

1966
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:42,900
uh, well, some of the evolution of the story has a lot to do with Makoto's voice actor.

1967
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:47,220
Um, and I'm sure the moment I say the name, a lot of people are going to go, I know that

1968
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:55,060
name, um, Ogata Megumi, who was, oh, let's see Shinji in Evangelion, uh, Sailor Uranus,

1969
01:46:55,060 --> 01:47:05,620
um, uh, Yukito in Cardcaptor Sakura, um, trying to think of some other ones that people would

1970
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:05,860
know.

1971
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:13,300
I know, uh, Yugi in Yugio, um, uh, I'm trying to think of some other ones that people would

1972
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:25,140
know, uh, uh, Yukimura Sanada in, uh, Samurai Deeper Kill, um, also did some voiceover,

1973
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:28,900
uh, did, uh, uh, Angelina Jolie's character in Hackers.

1974
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:37,140
Um, also, uh, I'm trying to think of something else that is a little bit more recent that

1975
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:37,860
people would know.

1976
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:50,420
Uh, oh, uh, was also in Ray Earth, um, in Bleach, uh, Super Robot, uh, Taisen, the animated,

1977
01:47:51,220 --> 01:48:01,940
um, and also in Danganronpa 2, also, uh, played, uh, uh, another, uh, another character,

1978
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:06,660
uh, there as well, who I will get into probably when I do Danganronpa 2.

1979
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:16,260
Um, but at any rate, uh, the writer, uh, Kodaka Kazutaka, um, wanted to do an original video

1980
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:22,580
game, um, and that thought his other ideas were too derivative from Action Adventure

1981
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:30,660
and felt that Action Adventure was becoming unpopular, so he wanted to do a darker narrative

1982
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:31,700
based around a killing game.

1983
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:38,340
Um, the original version wasn't very high speed, but that developed on the way, um,

1984
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:44,740
but Spike Chunsoft, uh, was, uh, thought it was pretty risky because it was kids killing

1985
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:47,620
each other, you know, in a high school environment.

1986
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:53,380
They really thought that that might not go over well, but a lot of people really picked

1987
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:56,420
up the, the style of the game.

1988
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:04,580
And so, um, they actually had some influence by, uh, by the late, uh, Hyde from, I don't

1989
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:11,140
ever remember if it was Hyde or Hide, but from X Japan who did pink blood to censor

1990
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:12,580
the blood and add stylishness.

1991
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:24,900
Um, the, uh, the word Danganronpa came from a character designer, um, Komatsuzaki Urui

1992
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:29,620
and was written in Kanji before it was changed to Kadokana for the logo.

1993
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:41,300
Um, and it goes around themes of, uh, despair and hope and pulled from, uh, some, uh, influences

1994
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:43,540
from Saw and Cube.

1995
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:45,940
Well, you know, that Hypercube is one of my favorite movies.

1996
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:51,940
And then it uses a special graphics technique that's called 2.5D motion graphics that

1997
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:55,940
blends 2D character items in a 3D explorable environment.

1998
01:49:55,940 --> 01:50:02,180
So kind of pop art style, like you can see as you like walk into rooms with some of the

1999
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:05,700
characters, how the items pop up like a pop-up book.

2000
01:50:06,660 --> 01:50:09,540
And then the characters are also, you know, that flat 2D.

2001
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:17,780
Um, and then, you know, they threw in a lot of, a lot of like surprise things, like, especially

2002
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:18,820
right from the beginning.

2003
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:27,380
Um, but what I was going back to for, um, Ogata being, um, Makoto's voice actor is that

2004
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:36,660
because of the energy and gravitas she put into the voice acting that Makoto was given

2005
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:45,700
a bigger, uh, a bigger impact on the game made a lot more of just the, you know, personal

2006
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:52,820
insertion character, but was, uh, made out to be a bigger, more important character.

2007
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:59,060
And as we've learned now through the franchise, a pretty ongoingly important character.

2008
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:08,660
Um, so at any rate, um, there also were, uh, some traits that were, that had in common

2009
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:12,820
with Battle Royale, as in the novel by Takami, uh, Koshin.

2010
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:22,820
Um, and, uh, they did originally also come up with the game with adult protagonists,

2011
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:27,540
but they thought that high school students were better because of their immaturity and

2012
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:31,780
would have more character development and that they would react differently than an

2013
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:33,780
adult would to a killing game.

2014
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:41,620
And that it's showing the balance between despair and, and hope.

2015
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:52,260
Um, so, uh, Oh, an interesting thing is that when the English dub came out, um, the publisher

2016
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:56,820
NIS was asked by Spike Chunsoft to keep Monokuma's name in intact.

2017
01:51:57,620 --> 01:52:02,260
And, uh, they also said though that that was their favorite character to localize,

2018
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:05,060
um, keeping the voice very similar.

2019
01:52:05,060 --> 01:52:07,780
They also, uh, kept the same soundtrack.

2020
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:09,220
Of course, the soundtrack is great.

2021
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:14,580
Um, but some of the other, uh, voice actors that they chose, they had a really hard time,

2022
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:20,260
especially for, uh, Toko, um, having an alter ego.

2023
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:22,900
They had to get two voice actors for Toko.

2024
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:27,460
Um, and then there were, of course, smartphone games that came out after that.

2025
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:28,820
So we're going to go into the legacy.

2026
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:35,540
Um, Danganronpa, Monokuma no Gakushu, um, which is Monokuma strikes back and then alter ego

2027
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:38,340
were put out for iOS and Android.

2028
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:46,740
And, uh, there also was a Danganronpa one, two reload, which was a Vita port of the first

2029
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:49,380
game and its sequel Danganronpa two goodbye despair.

2030
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:54,980
Um, which some people even say that that's superior to the first one, but I won't go

2031
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:55,620
there.

2032
01:52:55,620 --> 01:53:01,700
Um, I think that Shane likes that one the best because of a particular character who

2033
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:03,460
has a pet hamster.

2034
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:04,660
Who cares what he thinks.

2035
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:05,380
I'm just kidding.

2036
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:12,500
I do because we, when we work together, I actually gave him a key chain of that character.

2037
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:13,140
Oh, that's cool.

2038
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:13,940
Yeah.

2039
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:18,180
Um, I'm killing, I'm killing the B roll because I'm sick of all the ads.

2040
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:27,380
My, my favorite in the second game though, uh, has a little, um, uh, Galaga ship, uh,

2041
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:33,300
uh, uh, Vic Viper pin pixely Vic Viper pin that she wears in her hair.

2042
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:43,540
Um, but anyway, um, now the, uh, the game came out, uh, in, uh, in North America, in

2043
01:53:43,540 --> 01:53:45,540
Europe in February, 2014.

2044
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:50,340
Um, it came out on steam, uh, February, 2016.

2045
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:57,620
Um, Danganronpa went to reload, uh, came out on PlayStation four in North America and Europe

2046
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:01,380
in March, 2017 and in Japan on May 18th, 2017.

2047
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:06,660
There's also a virtual reality demo called cyber Danganronpa VR, the class trial, which

2048
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:07,940
is on PlayStation VR.

2049
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:15,300
There is an enhanced version called anniversary edition that came out May 21st, 2020.

2050
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:20,260
Um, else has, you know, it has the gallery mode, uh, like the other ones do.

2051
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:24,980
Um, and there was also a few other things, um, it's going to be released for switch.

2052
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:31,300
And then there's the Danganronpa Decadence bundle, um, will also come out separately

2053
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:37,060
and January 18th, 2022, it was released for Xbox one and windows via the Microsoft store.

2054
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:39,940
The game sold very well.

2055
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:42,020
Um, it was a big hit.

2056
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:48,900
Um, and they're also, um, I didn't mention it, but there is also like a full on action

2057
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:52,580
game where you play as Makoto's, uh, sister.

2058
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:57,380
And you have like a gun that has like different effects on people.

2059
01:54:58,180 --> 01:55:00,500
Um, you have to fight like all these Monokuma.

2060
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:05,540
Um, and the thing I like about it is that that game, uh, it was, it's called ultra despair

2061
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:06,040
girls.

2062
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:12,200
That game also played a lot into the closing of the chapter.

2063
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:13,960
So just go ahead and throw this out.

2064
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:24,520
There was an anime which retold, um, uh, the, first of all, it had the, the prelude to what

2065
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:27,720
happened in Danganronpa with the characters that were in the second game.

2066
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:34,120
And then it was called hope and despair where it, you would watch one episode and it was

2067
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:39,240
a prelude and the next episode was like in the future after the despair was already going

2068
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:40,360
on with a different group.

2069
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:46,200
Um, and there was also a Danganronpa anime just by itself, retelling the first game.

2070
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:54,520
So, uh, there's, there's just so much, um, there's also Danganronpa V3 killing harmony

2071
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,040
that came out in 2017.

2072
01:55:56,600 --> 01:56:00,440
Um, there had two manga, um, adaptations.

2073
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:08,200
There was a light novel, uh, two light novels, um, called Danganronpa if, where, uh, basically

2074
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:12,760
Makoto finds this, uh, fabled escape button early on.

2075
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:22,280
And then there's one called, uh, uh, I'm trying to see, uh, the, the tragic warriors of despair

2076
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:29,080
that, uh, is kind of like, they're both kind of alternate universe, uh, stories.

2077
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:30,200
Um, I've read them both.

2078
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:30,920
They're actually really good.

2079
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:43,720
Um, but this, this game is like, it's just all, I really don't know what else I can say

2080
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:48,920
about it because it's just had so much to it.

2081
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:57,080
Um, the game has received, you know, just wonderful ratings all across the board.

2082
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:02,280
Um, the Vita version has an 80 of 10 on Metacritic PC is 82 of a hundred on Metacritic.

2083
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:06,920
Um, it's just, it's all over the place.

2084
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:08,280
It really is.

2085
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:16,440
In fact, last night when I was, uh, uh, looking up, um, the, you know, stuff to do for the

2086
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:20,280
B roll, I just ended up just started watching through the play through.

2087
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:22,280
I was like, Oh yeah.

2088
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:24,680
And then I realized, Oh my gosh, what time is it?

2089
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:30,040
Um, but, uh, but yeah, it's absolutely worth it.

2090
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:32,360
And if you don't want to play through the first game, watch the anime.

2091
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:33,080
It's really good.

2092
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,960
I mean, it's really abbreviated.

2093
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:40,840
There's a lot of stuff that you'll miss from it, but it tells the story really good, really

2094
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:41,560
well.

2095
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:47,400
And all of the games are just really, really awesome.

2096
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:49,080
They're just, they're so in depth.

2097
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:54,280
I didn't get into V3 as much though, but the first two and ultra despair girls, I was totally

2098
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:54,600
into.

2099
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:55,880
All right.

2100
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:56,280
That's it.

2101
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,040
There's just classic game of the week.

2102
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:01,720
And I, I also was kind of surprised that this game is even 10 years old.

2103
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:05,560
Um, I, you know, obviously more than that, but, uh, yeah, it's just another one of those.

2104
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:05,800
Wow.

2105
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:06,920
I feel like it was only yesterday.

2106
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:09,320
I first heard about this game, but yeah, right.

2107
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:10,280
It is your classic game of the week.

2108
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:12,680
Don Gunropa playing it pretty religiously.

2109
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:13,180
Yeah.

2110
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:14,120
All right.

2111
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:17,880
Let's travel around the world and quickly check out some other headlines in a segment

2112
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,720
that we call rapid fire news.

2113
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:21,000
And we'll start with Loki.

2114
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:27,720
So, you know, getting a hint of all that movie action and movie money that they want.

2115
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:33,240
Um, Bandai Namco is planning for a live action Pac-Man movie.

2116
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:35,960
Okay.

2117
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:37,160
Who the fuck asked for that?

2118
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:38,760
Nobody.

2119
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:42,680
Nobody asked for that, but you know, Sonic the Hedgehog is doing well and people love

2120
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:44,920
Sonic the Hedgehog as much as they love Pac-Man.

2121
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:45,420
Right.

2122
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:46,300
Right.

2123
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:47,260
Right.

2124
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:49,900
Listen, here's the question.

2125
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:52,060
Pac-Man's already gotten their live action movie.

2126
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:56,940
It was, um, terrible and it started Adam Sandler and we don't need another live action.

2127
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:58,300
Yes.

2128
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:01,100
Here's the, here's the real question I have about this movie.

2129
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:03,340
Will the love interest be Ms.

2130
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:07,740
Pac-Man or Pac-Mom or both?

2131
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:15,580
Will this, uh, uh, Pac-Man movie explore the complicated pack love triangle.

2132
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:17,420
The Pac-Man suddenly finds himself in.

2133
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:23,580
He had the Pac-Man story on our Saturday morning cartoons, right?

2134
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:24,700
I just don't.

2135
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:28,860
And there was also the cupid cartoon and I watched them both and they were great.

2136
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:32,460
AJ twist and chat points out the smash multiverse movies grow.

2137
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:43,420
Yeah, but like, I just don't think that this will just, yeah, I just, I don't see that

2138
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:45,660
unless maybe they make a full on.

2139
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:48,620
Oh, it's so eighties like comedy out of it.

2140
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:49,100
I don't know.

2141
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:50,940
It has to be right.

2142
01:59:50,940 --> 01:59:53,660
Aside from just like saying, you know, it's going to be terrible.

2143
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:57,500
So this was reported, um, wayfarer studios.

2144
01:59:57,500 --> 01:59:59,580
They're teamed up with light beam entertainment.

2145
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:05,100
Um, and they're going to make the live action movie based on it.

2146
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:06,540
And that's, that's all we know so far.

2147
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:07,680
Um.

2148
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:16,700
It'll be based on a new original story from Chuck Williams.

2149
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:25,020
And, um, he was the producer of, or one of the producers on the hedgehog.

2150
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:29,340
Did you say it was light beam entertainment or light year entertainment?

2151
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:33,740
It was light beam entertainment.

2152
02:00:33,740 --> 02:00:34,300
Interesting.

2153
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:37,100
Cause I couldn't even find them on like Wiki or anything like that.

2154
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:38,620
So they must be a huge studio.

2155
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:40,300
Yeah.

2156
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:41,100
So huge.

2157
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:49,340
Um, yeah, I, I will Chuck, I think that's Chuck Williams company.

2158
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:55,500
So, um, it says a original idea from Chuck Williams who did, it was a producer of Sonic

2159
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:57,980
the hedgehog of light beam entertainment.

2160
02:00:57,980 --> 02:01:00,380
So it's probably his production company is what it is.

2161
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:00,860
Oh, okay.

2162
02:01:00,860 --> 02:01:01,500
Bad idea.

2163
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:05,180
Um, but can they not?

2164
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:08,860
I don't know.

2165
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:10,300
It sounds stupid.

2166
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:10,540
Okay.

2167
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:13,100
Whatever it may happen or it may get canceled.

2168
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:15,020
You know, we'll see.

2169
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:19,260
Um, anyways, aside from that, this is kind of cool.

2170
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:24,700
So there's been a secret two player mode that's been discovered in super punch out.

2171
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:28,220
Um, remember that game that came out in 94?

2172
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:31,420
I mean, that was a while ago, but apparently no

2173
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:33,100
one's found it until now.

2174
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:41,420
And it allows you to basically control the other boxer, uh, with the second player controller.

2175
02:01:41,420 --> 02:01:48,780
So the way you do it is you hold Y and R and then press air start on the start menu.

2176
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:53,580
And then it allows you to select which character and then player two gets to control it.

2177
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:56,220
It's like, it's like the ducks and duck hunt.

2178
02:01:57,100 --> 02:02:01,340
And it works if you have the Nintendo switch online version, because, you know, it's just

2179
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:02,460
a ROM of the old game.

2180
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:05,900
So this is something that you can literally check out on your Nintendo switch right now,

2181
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:09,820
assuming you have a, um, uh, Nintendo switch online account.

2182
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:10,380
It's pretty cool.

2183
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:12,380
Yeah.

2184
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:12,700
All right.

2185
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:13,900
So very neat.

2186
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:14,700
Uh, dark soccer.

2187
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:18,460
What do you have for us for rapid fire news or stadium news?

2188
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:27,820
Stadia 4.26, uh, is putting in a claim all for pro games, uh, and some new, uh, language,

2189
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:28,700
uh, options.

2190
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:33,980
So, um, you know, cause normally when you have, when you get the free games, you go through

2191
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:37,340
one by one and click claim, but now you're going to get a claim all so that you can just

2192
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:38,060
get them all.

2193
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:45,580
Um, they also, uh, and basically these come from just, you know, uh, digging through the

2194
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:56,140
APKs, um, but they also are putting out, uh, some, uh, some, uh, language options, including,

2195
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:58,860
uh, uh, Spanish.

2196
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:05,100
Um, they're actually, I think, or they're doing both Castilian Spanish and Mexican Spanish.

2197
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:15,180
Um, and then they're doing, um, uh, Turkish, apparently they're also doing, uh, uh, Caribbean

2198
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:15,740
Spanish.

2199
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:20,860
And then, uh, and also a few other ones on here from what it looks like.

2200
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:26,540
Um, they're also, there's references to a, my library link, but no one really knows what

2201
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:27,100
that's about.

2202
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:33,020
And then there's also now references to a multi-stream and multi-stream controller.

2203
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:43,100
So, uh, looking also into like some other, uh, motion devices and, uh, tips and tricks.

2204
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:45,420
So kind of cool.

2205
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:48,620
All right.

2206
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:58,460
But yeah, I, I, I love when a company realizes that not everyone speaks the same version

2207
02:03:58,460 --> 02:04:04,620
of a language, you know, like even British and Canadian English is a little bit different

2208
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:05,420
from each other.

2209
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:05,980
Sure.

2210
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:06,780
Yeah.

2211
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:12,060
So there's words that are fully acceptable to say here in the US that are completely

2212
02:04:12,060 --> 02:04:16,700
unacceptable in England, as we know from Beyonce's edits.

2213
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:16,860
Yeah.

2214
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:17,740
Lizzo and Beyonce.

2215
02:04:17,740 --> 02:04:17,900
Yeah.

2216
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:18,700
Yeah.

2217
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:24,380
So I think that it's, it's really, really good.

2218
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:28,700
I think that that's a great thing that they're doing, you know, understanding that, that

2219
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:31,260
it may be the same language, but they're not spoken the same way.

2220
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:35,020
It was, I was going to say that kind of goes the other way too, because, you know, there's

2221
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:41,100
the see you next Tuesday word that is, you know, a very common, uh, slang and overseas.

2222
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:44,220
Everybody in the UK right now, I'm using, I'm using, oh yes.

2223
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:44,380
Right.

2224
02:04:44,380 --> 02:04:45,260
Cause that too.

2225
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:51,020
Uh, but yeah, but that word is, um, very, very, very offensive, um, here.

2226
02:04:51,020 --> 02:04:53,260
So, um, yeah, I say it all the time.

2227
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:59,100
I don't even, you know, I have way too many British and Australian friends.

2228
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:00,220
I know.

2229
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:03,580
I kind of, I got in a habit when JJ was visiting.

2230
02:05:05,740 --> 02:05:10,620
Anyway, one of my, one of my drag queen friends, miss Patsy declined to love you.

2231
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:11,100
Mean it.

2232
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:12,380
All right.

2233
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:15,980
Shifting gears a little bit, shifting guilty gears a little bit.

2234
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:16,480
Haha.

2235
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:20,860
Let's talk about something that was announced, announced at Evo last week.

2236
02:05:20,860 --> 02:05:23,900
I think it was just about the time we were wrapping up OLR last week.

2237
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:29,580
But they did announce on, uh, the end of the stream, uh, or sorry, at the end of Evo, uh,

2238
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:33,820
that there was going to be some new DLC that was coming to guilty gear X two.

2239
02:05:33,820 --> 02:05:34,320
I'm sorry.

2240
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:35,820
Sorry.

2241
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:37,660
Not, that was the, that was the older game.

2242
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:42,940
This is a new DLC that was coming out for guilty your strive, excuse me, uh, a character

2243
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:49,660
that originally was in guilty your X to Bridget, uh, a character that uses a yo-yo and a mechanized,

2244
02:05:49,660 --> 02:05:51,020
uh, teddy bear.

2245
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:54,620
Um, so, uh, Bridget is also a very popular character in the franchise.

2246
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:59,260
Uh, so it was probably a foregone conclusion that Bridget was going to be added to strive.

2247
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:01,100
So that was, uh, announced at Evo.

2248
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:05,820
Now, another interesting thing that happened, um, as part of the story plot.

2249
02:06:05,820 --> 02:06:10,700
Once the, um, DLC was released and people were jumping into it and, uh, you know, exploring

2250
02:06:10,700 --> 02:06:16,140
the story, it turns out that Bridget, um, is now a pretty cool representation in the

2251
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:20,620
game, uh, as Bridget was confirmed a trans character, uh, in the game.

2252
02:06:20,620 --> 02:06:26,060
I can't confess to know the lore in the game, so I don't want to like misrepresent something.

2253
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:31,180
But my understanding is that, uh, it sounds like Bridget was kind of had a stereotypical

2254
02:06:31,180 --> 02:06:33,580
feminine design in the series.

2255
02:06:33,580 --> 02:06:38,380
Uh, previously, uh, the story that I'm looking at is she was born in an English village with

2256
02:06:38,380 --> 02:06:42,540
a male twin and the village had a superstition that twins of the same gender were bad luck.

2257
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:46,780
So to avoid exiling her, sacrificing her, her parents raised her as a girl.

2258
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:52,700
Um, and there's some dialogue that happens where one of the characters says cow girl

2259
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:56,940
or a cowboy and Bridget responds, cow girl is fine because I'm a girl.

2260
02:06:56,940 --> 02:07:01,980
So, um, and that pronoun swap is, uh, intended to reveal Bridget's trans identity.

2261
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:05,660
Again, I hope I'm reporting that right, but I'm not super familiar with the story in the

2262
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:06,460
series.

2263
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:11,020
Um, so it's, it's hard for me to say it's this or it's this, but, um, my understanding

2264
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:15,340
is it's, uh, some representation, um, maybe unexpected.

2265
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:16,860
Again, I don't know, I don't follow the series.

2266
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:18,620
I don't know if it was expected or not.

2267
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:21,580
Um, but, uh, more representation is always a great thing.

2268
02:07:21,580 --> 02:07:22,780
So, um, pretty cool to see.

2269
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:26,620
And a lot of people on Twitter, uh, were very happy to, um, hear about that.

2270
02:07:27,020 --> 02:07:28,300
So, all right.

2271
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:33,500
Anyhow, uh, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates

2272
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:35,660
of some games coming out near you soon.

2273
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:37,260
We'll start with the U S slow key.

2274
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:41,740
So this week we've got fashion police squad coming out on PC.

2275
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:43,660
Oh, you have, you've had your eye on that one.

2276
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:45,420
Yeah, that looks fun.

2277
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:49,580
Uh, multiverses is finally coming out after the short delay that they had.

2278
02:07:49,580 --> 02:07:54,700
So, uh, PC PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

2279
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:56,940
Is that out of like early access or something?

2280
02:07:56,940 --> 02:07:58,300
Cause it's been on the Epic store.

2281
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:01,740
It's been in beta, so now it's actually out.

2282
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:02,140
Got it.

2283
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:02,780
The real deal.

2284
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:03,280
All right.

2285
02:08:04,140 --> 02:08:04,700

Uh, they're great.

2303
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:37,580
uh, tale of paper refolded.

2304
02:09:37,580 --> 02:09:40,220
Oh, that one looked, I think that was the one that looked really cool.

2305

Um, that's on PC, Xbox one, Xbox series, uh, cloud punk coming to PlayStation

And last but not least Madden NFL 23 on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation

2308
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:02,460
five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

2309
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:04,700
Oh, it's Madden time already, huh?

2310
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:06,380
All right.

2311
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:07,100
Yep.

2312
02:10:07,100 --> 02:10:10,540
Well, traveling to Japan, I don't know why there's such a stark difference

2313
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:13,580
between the U S which is full of releases this week, especially with

2314
02:10:13,580 --> 02:10:17,580
Madden, uh, and Japan, but Japan has one release this week on the PlayStation

2315
02:10:17,580 --> 02:10:19,180
four and five it's a vampire.

2316
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:23,020
The masquerade swung song gets its release in Japan this week.

2317
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:25,900
Um, that's, I believe this just recently came out here.

2318
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:27,740
That's that's it.

2319
02:10:27,740 --> 02:10:29,500
Uh, it's the only release in Japan this week.

2320
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:32,300
Again, I don't know why the difference, I don't know if it's because maybe

2321
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:34,860
Madden isn't as big of a deal over there or something.

2322
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:38,220
It's more FIFA or whatever, but, or, um, yeah, I just.

2323
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:40,700
Because they know what real football is.

2324
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:41,580
I guess so.

2325
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:44,540
I, I, yeah, it's just a much slower week.

2326
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:46,940
So I will go over to the UK and see how things look over there.

2327
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:47,500
Dark soccer.

2328
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:53,420
Only, uh, four things, uh, on the 16th, we have way of the Hunter for

2329
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:59,900
PlayStation, Xbox and a PC, uh, time Asia on PlayStation and Xbox on the 18th.

2330
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:03,740
And then on the 19th, Madden 23 and bug snacks on switch.

2331
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:05,420
Snacks.

2332
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:07,660
All right.

2333
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:11,020
Let's get some more headlines and then we will get to your calls.

2334
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:15,420
If we have any tonight over it, uh, vog network.com slash discord.

2335
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:17,820
Again, that's VOG network.com slash discord.

2336
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:20,780
If you want to join in the conversation throughout the week, I promise.

2337
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:24,300
We really, really limit the use of the everyone tag.

2338
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:25,020
So don't worry.

2339
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:28,780
And I know you probably have a hundred discords, but we will not spam you with

2340
02:11:28,780 --> 02:11:30,540
everyone tags unless it's really important.

2341
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:32,540
I don't think I can't even remember the last time we used it.

2342
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:36,620
We don't use it every time we go live, but, uh, you can see when hosts go live

2343
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:39,900
on their personal streams, not within everyone tag, but if you keep your eye

2344
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:43,500
on the, uh, uh, Twitch channel, it does show you if, you know, Jamie does a

2345
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:47,020
stream or I do a stream or Bobby does a stream or we all do a stream, uh, all

2346
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:47,900
pings in that channel.

2347
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:51,180
So, uh, check that over at vog network.com slash discord.

2348
02:11:51,180 --> 02:11:53,180
Meanwhile, we have some more stories for you.

2349
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:53,580
Loki.

2350
02:11:54,540 --> 02:11:54,860
Yes.

2351
02:11:54,860 --> 02:11:58,940
So apparently in attempt has been accused of firing, um, a worker for

2352
02:11:58,940 --> 02:11:59,820
speaking up.

2353
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:06,380
So there's been some allegations according to, it's been filed with

2354
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:11,900
national labor relations board, um, seeing, and I guess, uh, against

2355
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:15,180
Nintendo and the contract hiring agency, Aston Carter.

2356
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:19,180
And apparently they're saying there's concerted activities or they're

2357
02:12:19,180 --> 02:12:22,140
interfering with concerted activities of workers, including possible

2358
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:23,740
retaliation and coercion.

2359
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:29,180
Um, the actual allegations, like some of these were, it says within six

2360
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:33,980
months employer discharged an employee or employees, uh, because the

2361
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:37,180
employees engaged in protected concerted activities.

2362
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:42,940
By, I don't know, this is lawyer speak inter Alia, uh, protesting terms

2363
02:12:42,940 --> 02:12:44,300
and conditions of employment.

2364
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:47,980
And in order to discourage employees from engaging in protected

2365
02:12:47,980 --> 02:12:51,580
concerted activities, uh, it says within the previous six months, the

2366
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:56,220
employer has interfered with risk with restraint and courses employees

2367
02:12:56,780 --> 02:13:00,860
in the exercise of rights protected by section seven of the act by

2368
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:04,700
maintaining the work rules that prohibit employees from discussing

2369
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:07,500
wages, hours, and other terms of conditions of employment.

2370
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:11,260
So basically, you know, sharing what they're, they're making that type

2371
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:11,660
of stuff.

2372
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:15,660
And, you know, there's a lot of companies that will try to get you

2373
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:18,300
not to do that, even though it is legal, at least in the United States

2374
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:18,780
to do that.

2375
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:25,500
Um, so interesting people to talk about what they make and verify

2376
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:28,300
with your teammates, what they make for pay equity.

2377
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:30,860
Yeah.

2378
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:34,860
So, um, apparently there was a report that was published back in

2379
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:39,500
April, Nintendo's president, Doug Bowser said, I posted a message

2380
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:43,100
internally to employees saying that executive leadership team was

2381
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:46,700
reviewing the allegations and the company had zero tolerance policy

2382
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:49,420
for discrimination, harassment, intimidation.

2383
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:52,300
But apparently like, it sounds like it's still going on.

2384
02:13:53,180 --> 02:13:56,380
And I also want to point out if you're kind of having that thought

2385
02:13:56,380 --> 02:14:00,540
of like deja vu is didn't already talk about this a few weeks ago.

2386
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:02,620
No, because this is a second time.

2387
02:14:02,620 --> 02:14:06,060
This is a new incident than what was talked about before.

2388
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:10,060
Although there are some very similar parallels here, um, including

2389
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:14,940
both Nintendo and the staffing agency being named, uh, in what's

2390
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:15,660
going on here.

2391
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:18,860
And it's just, um, it's kind of showing that like, you know, I know

2392
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:23,180
Nintendo, uh, oftentimes in the industry is viewed as they do things

2393
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:25,820
differently over there and, you know, they get gaming in a different

2394
02:14:25,820 --> 02:14:26,940
way and so forth.

2395
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:34,620
Uh, but some of the problems aren't necessarily, you know, invisible

2396
02:14:34,620 --> 02:14:35,180
over there.

2397
02:14:35,180 --> 02:14:40,300
So, um, so the ad, so what they said that also the, some of the

2398
02:14:40,300 --> 02:14:43,820
sources that were familiar with what was going on here said that

2399
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:47,660
it stemmed from a contract employee asking questions about unions at

2400
02:14:47,660 --> 02:14:52,140
a meeting and later being fired over something, some sort of

2401
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:54,780
borderline violation of their NDA.

2402
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:58,220
So it's like kind of finding a reason to fire them.

2403
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:04,220
I wonder if some of this, the fact that it's showing up in the

2404
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:08,540
news and stuff is going to have Nintendo kind of realign some

2405
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:12,300
things, or if this, they, they just try to make this mysteriously

2406
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:13,500
go away, like the first time.

2407
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:14,720
Maybe.

2408
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:15,780
Yeah.

2409
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:17,760
Well, thanks for bringing it to light anyway.

2410
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,600
So it's unfortunate, but, uh, yeah.

2411
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:23,520
Uh, as 200 Matt points out, it's an epidemic in the industry, not

2412
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:26,400
just one or two companies it's everywhere and it sucks.

2413
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:29,120
And I think that's one reason why when it is Nintendo, it really

2414
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:33,200
catches our attention because Nintendo, unfortunately it's in the

2415
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:33,700
same boat.

2416
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:38,480
So it may not be quite as horrifically mismanaged at the top as

2417
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:40,960
some of these other organizations we've been talking about, but

2418
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:42,720
it's not to say the problems don't exist.

2419
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:49,520
Well, it's really bad for contractors because they, they it's, they

2420
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:50,640
could get you for anything.

2421
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:52,480
Really, they could get you for anything.

2422
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:54,080
And it's ridiculous.

2423
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:54,580
Yeah.

2424
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:55,680
All right.

2425
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:59,200
Well, let's, uh, let's, let's revisit some classics again, not

2426
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:02,000
the classic game of the week, but something else in the classics

2427
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:02,960
department, dark Sakura.

2428
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:09,280
Um, well, there's, uh, uh, more games, uh, announced for the

2429
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:12,480
Sega, uh, the, uh, mega drive mini too.

2430
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:17,520
Um, so, uh, of course it's coming out, um, in North America

2431
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:19,440
and Japan on October 27th.

2432
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:27,120
Um, it is, uh, going to include for cartridge titles, the, uh,

2433
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,520
new, uh, announcements.

2434
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:32,960
So we have gang ground fantasy star, two populace, uh,

2435
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:36,880
sorcery and togyo King colossus and viewpoint.

2436
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:41,760
And then the, uh, mega CD titles echo the dolphin CD robo

2437
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:46,160
lest, which I own both of those romances, the three kingdoms

2438
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:50,720
Shin Megami Tensei and Tenka Fubo a touch, you know, uh, local.

2439
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:56,240
This is sounding like a pretty cool little device.

2440
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:57,840
I hope I can find one.

2441
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:02,880
Does this sound like it's going to be easy to get in your pre-order?

2442
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:03,440
Yeah, that's true.

2443
02:17:03,440 --> 02:17:04,160
That's true.

2444
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:08,240
As she says, I pre is doing that as one of the masses.

2445
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:10,240
I pre-ordered the NA Genesis mini too.

2446
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:12,960
Even though the shipping is 25 bucks for international shipping.

2447
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,680
It's just annoying.

2448
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:15,200
That's the only way to get it.

2449
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:17,120
So, all right.

2450
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:18,880
Just a few more stories for you, Loki.

2451
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:20,560
All right.

2452
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:26,560
And so EA is, uh, basically claiming that, Hey, you know what, you know,

2453
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:29,280
those loot boxes that you guys always complain about with FIFA.

2454
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:32,560
Well, it's actually, you know, what people love those loot boxes.

2455
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:33,600
They love them.

2456
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:38,480
And I mean, I understand what they're saying because, you know,

2457
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,960
they, they're making dunk on them there.

2458
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:47,280
Well, no, they're making the claim that we will hardly believe that ultimate team in the,

2459
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:53,920
the food packs, um, have been, which have been part of the game for more than a decade are

2460
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:55,920
part of the FIFA that players love.

2461
02:17:56,720 --> 02:18:01,680
Fans love that game reflects, uh, the real world excitement, strategy of building, managing

2462
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:05,600
a squad, giving players a choice to spend if they want is fair.

2463
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:11,520
The reason why I think that they're saying that they love them is because they're making

2464
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:16,320
so much money from them because people are buying them and because people are buying them.

2465
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:19,200
But I don't know if people necessarily love them.

2466
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:24,400
I think that there's a lot, a good percentage of people that are pressured into buying them

2467
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:28,880
because either they're susceptible to that type of practice or frustration or whatever

2468
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:30,000
the case may be.

2469
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:30,400
Loki.

2470
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:31,440
I got some breaking news.

2471
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:32,480
I have some breaking news.

2472
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:36,320
EA is saying right now that people love taxes.

2473
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:38,400
People love taxes.

2474
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:41,120
Loki, everybody's paying them.

2475
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:44,640
Well, except some people, most people are paying taxes.

2476
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:47,120
I'm actually kind of a fan of taxes.

2477
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:49,200
But yeah.

2478
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:50,880
All right.

2479
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:52,080
You'd love to be contrarian.

2480
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:52,400
All right.

2481
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:54,640
I'm a big socialist.

2482
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:55,040
I know.

2483
02:18:55,680 --> 02:19:01,040
I like my taxes when they go for things like infrastructure and roads and education and

2484
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:03,680
stuff like that that we probably wouldn't afford if we didn't have taxes.

2485
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:04,000
All right.

2486
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,440
Thanks for poking a hole in my joke.

2487
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:06,480
Finish your story, Loki.

2488
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:11,680
So I mean, yeah, that's the argument that they're trying to make is basically that,

2489
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:12,400
hey, you know.

2490
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:18,080
The people buy them, we make tons of money off of them, and so therefore people love

2491
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:18,400
them.

2492
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,880
I don't know that's necessarily true, though.

2493
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:25,760
And obviously there's other issues with it, like the fact that it may be addictive, like

2494
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:27,040
gambling and stuff like that.

2495
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:32,160
It has the same type of, you know, feedback for like a person when they're purchasing

2496
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:33,680
those and opening them up and stuff.

2497
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:40,640
So I mean, obviously, if it was all fun and games, then they wouldn't be banned in a few

2498
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:45,920
countries already because it goes against their gambling laws or they wouldn't be, you

2499
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:52,240
know, catching the attention of congressmen because it's it.

2500
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,440
Sure, I get it.

2501
02:19:55,440 --> 02:19:56,560
Like loot box.

2502
02:19:56,560 --> 02:20:00,880
People do buy those and there's a lot like people that will buy large quantities of those.

2503
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:04,720
Hell, there's like streamers out there that will pay hundreds of thousands of dollars

2504
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:08,400
for like DLC for games because it's content.

2505
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,440
Diablo immortal.

2506
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:11,360
Yeah, which is horrible.

2507
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:13,120
But like, that's what they're going to use.

2508
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:17,680
Like one person paid us a hundred thousand dollars.

2509
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:20,320
Like, of course, we're going to keep doing it.

2510
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:24,400
Yeah.

2511
02:20:24,400 --> 02:20:28,640
And yeah, and that Diablo immortal, you know, even though I say that kind of tongue in cheek,

2512
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:32,720
it's it's the same thing because that game is making lots and lots and lots of money.

2513
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:36,320
And I'm not so sure it deserves to make as much money as it's making.

2514
02:20:36,320 --> 02:20:39,760
But a lot of this content creators out there, you know, you've heard the horror stories

2515
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:42,400
about somebody spending a hundred thousand dollars and all this stuff.

2516
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:46,400
Sure, that's just one person, but it's one person spending a hundred thousand.

2517
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:48,320
How many others are spending thousands of dollars?

2518
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:49,360
And it adds up.

2519
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:50,640
It's it's wild.

2520
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:53,120
So all right.

2521
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,920
Anyhow, one more story for you.

2522
02:20:55,920 --> 02:21:00,000
And this is in the sadness department, but I'm sure many of you have heard this week

2523
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:05,920
that we lost Olivia Newton-John, of course, is the you know, everybody knows Olivia Newton-John

2524
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:06,480
from Greece.

2525
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:11,520
If you're Dark Soccer, I was just about to say, if you let me finish.

2526
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:18,800
It was Xanadu, which had that animation part in there that was done by Don Bluth, who did

2527
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:23,600
Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, you know, had that little bit in Xanadu.

2528
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:30,080
But of course, of course, of course, we have to mention what you might wonder, what does

2529
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,640
Olivia Newton-John have to do with video games?

2530
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:38,560
Well, I would hope I would hope you know where this show has its roots, and that is with

2531
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:39,840
Dance Dance Revolution.

2532
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:44,000
And the very first song many people played in Dance Dance Revolution back in the day,

2533
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:49,520
I know it was the first song I ever played, was a cover by the Olivia Project who covered

2534
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:53,120
Olivia Newton-John songs, and it was much cheaper to get the rights to those.

2535
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:57,200
A cover of Olivia Newton-John called Have You Never Been Mellow.

2536
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:02,240
Now, if your first time you played DDR was on a third mix machine, perhaps you actually

2537
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:08,400
played on Xanadu, which was another Olivia Project song that was in DDR.

2538
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:12,720
And what's really funny is that there's some commentary I'm seeing on that where people

2539
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:18,240
thought the movie Xanadu was about like a demon princess or something because of the

2540
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:25,840
background in DDR, because it has a very strange, like, shadowy lady figure with eyes.

2541
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:31,840
And it's like, no, Xanadu is about a roller rake and a muse.

2542
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:33,520
And it has Gene Kelly in it.

2543
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:33,760
Yeah.

2544
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:36,560
It was Queen Kelly's last acting role.

2545
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:36,800
Yeah.

2546
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:45,600
So we watched Xanadu in my dorm room, me and Finara, when Gene Kelly died, and our other

2547
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:46,400
friends there.

2548
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:51,760
And then I watched Xanadu after Olivia Newton-John died, and I played the soundtrack on my stream.

2549
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:57,040
Well, all of her stuff, not all the ELO stuff, because, I mean, Electric Light Orchestra.

2550
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:01,120
And she was also in...

2551
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:05,200
Actually, my favorite song that she did was from another movie with John Travolta that

2552
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:07,680
for the life of me, I can't remember the name because it's not a good movie.

2553
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:13,040
But Twist of Fate.

2554
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:15,520
Oh, where the song comes from?

2555
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:16,560
Yeah.

2556
02:23:18,160 --> 02:23:19,680
Well, the song is what I like.

2557
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:22,960
Although the video is like fucking weird.

2558
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:26,240
But there's a great lip sync on Drag Race.

2559
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:29,440
And Olivia Newton-John was there, and it was Katya versus Sasha Bell.

2560
02:23:29,440 --> 02:23:29,840
Oh, yeah.

2561
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:30,320
Yeah.

2562
02:23:30,320 --> 02:23:30,880
That one was...

2563
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:31,760
I remember that.

2564
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:35,600
But that is, though, my favorite Olivia Newton-John song.

2565
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:38,400
And she was looking really well.

2566
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:39,840
Oh, she was.

2567
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:41,440
Whenever I see her on TV.

2568
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:44,080
She had battled cancer several times, unfortunately.

2569
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:46,880
That's stage four metastatic breast cancer.

2570
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:51,280
Now, Bubby Blackwolf in chat points out, I thought Butterfly was people's first.

2571
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:52,720
Well, here's the thing.

2572
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:56,320
In the original DDR game, there was only so many songs.

2573
02:23:56,320 --> 02:24:01,360
And the easiest song, the one footer song was that.

2574
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:03,280
So most people started there.

2575
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:04,240
But here's the thing.

2576
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:07,520
Most games of DDR were about three songs back then.

2577
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:12,640
So you would play Have You Never Been Mellow, Boom Boom Dollar, which was the two footer,

2578
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:14,960
and then Butterfly, which was the three footer.

2579
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:17,040
So Butterfly was kind of in your first set.

2580
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:21,840
And Butterfly was also the song that like, have you never been mellow, you may or may

2581
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:26,000
not have recognized depending on how much you knew about 70s hits and so forth.

2582
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:31,200
But like, Butterfly was like that uniquely DDR sound to it.

2583
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:32,320
You know, that really started.

2584
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:34,480
And it's got a catchy fucking hook.

2585
02:24:34,480 --> 02:24:37,840
That's not to say the Olivia Newton-John song doesn't, but that was more of a slow

2586
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:38,160
jam.

2587
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:40,320
It was meant to be the starter song.

2588
02:24:40,320 --> 02:24:47,280
Butterfly had a very catchy hook that, you know, that whole thing that made it stick

2589
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:47,840
with people.

2590
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:49,840
And so they remember that.

2591
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:52,720
And of course, you know, some people didn't start with the easiest song.

2592
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:54,320
They might have amped it up a little bit.

2593
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:57,120
So or they didn't start on a 1.0 machine.

2594
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:03,040
They may have started on a USA mix, which I don't think did the USA mix have Butterfly?

2595
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:03,680
I don't think it did.

2596
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:05,920
It had Boys by Smile DJ, but not Butterfly.

2597
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:07,280
I had the Speed Mix.

2598
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:09,600
May have had the Uprising one.

2599
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:10,100
Yeah.

2600
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:16,240
There is something that is worth noting is that when Have You Never Been Mellow came

2601
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:20,560
out, it was when she was being marketed as a country singer.

2602
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:25,200
And it was her first charting single in Japan.

2603
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,880
No, it wasn't on there.

2604
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:30,080
Yeah, no, I know the original Butterfly wasn't on USA mix.

2605
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:30,640
I remember that.

2606
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:33,200
The Speed Mix, I think was, but not the original.

2607
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:34,400
No, neither.

2608
02:25:34,400 --> 02:25:35,120
Really?

2609
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:36,880
Okay, interesting.

2610
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:40,080
It also makes me think that that's why that song was in DDR.

2611
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:44,960
It's very easy to confuse third mix with USA mix because they had the same interface.

2612
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:49,360
So sometimes it kind of blurs together a little bit, but I distinctly remember Boys

2613
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:52,240
by Smile DK was like the song that was in there.

2614
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:56,160
And then Boom Boom Dollar was definitely in it because that ended up being kind of in

2615
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:56,640
there.

2616
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:56,960
What?

2617
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:59,360
No, that was third mix.

2618
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:01,600
It was in the home version then.

2619
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:04,640
It had to have been.

2620
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:06,080
Maybe.

2621
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:06,720
Wow.

2622
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:08,480
If I forgot that, boy, oh boy.

2623
02:26:10,320 --> 02:26:13,040
You think we're talking about games that were 20 years old or something?

2624
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:14,400
Oh my gosh.

2625
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:15,920
She was in Sharknado 5.

2626
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:17,440
Oh, was she?

2627
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:18,320
That's funny.

2628
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:21,280
And I'm also like, wait, there was a Sharknado 5?

2629
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:25,200
All right, we're going to get to the listener round table.

2630
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:30,880
We want to invite your chat comments, your emails, your tweets, and Discord calls over

2631
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:35,440
at our green room over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2632
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:36,400
One last little thing.

2633
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:38,560
The movie I couldn't think of the name of is Two of a Kind.

2634
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:39,680
Oh, okay.

2635
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:41,300
Okay.

2636
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:46,260
I don't think I ever saw that, but I know she did make that other movie with John Travolta

2637
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:46,900
after the fact.

2638
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:47,700
I just never saw it.

2639
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:49,860
So, all right.

2640
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:54,020
I'm checking quickly to see if we got any tweets this week over at OLR.

2641
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:57,460
I'll check in with Dark Soccer to see if anybody emailed us.

2642
02:26:57,460 --> 02:27:00,340
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2643
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:01,940
We just had garbage.

2644
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:03,780
Garbage.

2645
02:27:03,780 --> 02:27:04,580
Which I deleted.

2646
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:11,460
And I will say we had one tweet this week from Office Underscore Stop, who tweeted us

2647
02:27:11,460 --> 02:27:13,060
during last week's show.

2648
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:16,580
And I thought this was pretty cool because they actually showed off their setup here

2649
02:27:16,580 --> 02:27:20,420
Sunday night with Twitch, VOG Network, OLR, and the Steam Deck.

2650
02:27:20,420 --> 02:27:24,740
And for those of you that are listening on the podcast feed, they've got OLR up on the

2651
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:28,900
television, a Steam Deck on their lap, and then what was the other thing they named?

2652
02:27:29,940 --> 02:27:33,140
Something else multitasking on the laptop in front of them.

2653
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:35,060
That's an impressive amount of multitasking.

2654
02:27:35,060 --> 02:27:35,780
But you know what?

2655
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:39,300
Hey, if we're your background noise, I'll take it.

2656
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:42,900
I'm happy to be your background noise.

2657
02:27:43,860 --> 02:27:48,500
And Bobby Black Wolf points out that doesn't look like OLR on the TV.

2658
02:27:49,060 --> 02:27:51,700
No, it is the Bobby Black Wolf logo.

2659
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:53,780
But I will point out, it's probably very hard to see.

2660
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:58,340
It says underneath that Bobby Black Wolf logo, thanks for watching.

2661
02:27:59,540 --> 02:28:01,300
Meaning your show is over.

2662
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:09,060
They were preparing for OLR, but I'm glad that they spent all of Sunday night here at

2663
02:28:09,060 --> 02:28:10,180
the Voice of Geeks Network.

2664
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:12,260
So appreciate that and the tweet.

2665
02:28:12,260 --> 02:28:14,180
I'd love to see other people set up.

2666
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:19,060
If you have a complex system of multitasking while you participate with OLR, to be honest,

2667
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:19,860
I'd love to see it.

2668
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:20,900
Tweet us at OLR.

2669
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:22,180
I'll retweet.

2670
02:28:22,180 --> 02:28:22,680
I will.

2671
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:24,100
I love retweeting.

2672
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:25,140
Did I retweet that one?

2673
02:28:26,580 --> 02:28:27,460
I don't know if I did.

2674
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:30,420
Maybe I quote tweeted it.

2675
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:31,540
Oh, one quote tweet.

2676
02:28:31,540 --> 02:28:32,100
Oh, yes, I did.

2677
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:33,060
I quote tweeted it.

2678
02:28:33,220 --> 02:28:36,180
So send us your setups for OLR.

2679
02:28:36,180 --> 02:28:38,340
Twitter.com slash OLR.

2680
02:28:39,220 --> 02:28:42,420
All right, so no emails, no other tweets.

2681
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:45,380
How about any last minute stories or things from Loki?

2682
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:47,140
No, I don't have anything.

2683
02:28:47,140 --> 02:28:47,640
All right.

2684
02:28:48,340 --> 02:28:48,840
Wow.

2685
02:28:51,060 --> 02:28:51,940
No one's calling?

2686
02:28:51,940 --> 02:28:53,540
I know we don't have calls either.

2687
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:58,420
Well, you know, honestly, it was kind of a slower news week, all things considered.

2688
02:28:58,420 --> 02:29:01,780
I mean, again, Jason kind of razzed us in the intro there about the announcement of an

2689
02:29:01,780 --> 02:29:05,300
announcement, and you heard the Japanese release dates there.

2690
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:09,620
We are in that kind of end of summer period where, you know, it's going to start to ramp

2691
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:11,700
up once we get past about Labor Day.

2692
02:29:11,700 --> 02:29:16,660
Then that's when the holidays, you know, pumpkin spice lattes hit Starbucks, and then that's

2693
02:29:16,660 --> 02:29:19,700
when, you know, things start to really ramp up.

2694
02:29:19,700 --> 02:29:22,580
So anyway, gingerbread latte wins.

2695
02:29:22,580 --> 02:29:27,140
Well, remember, all that stuff is kind of I want to say it's over for me, but it's not

2696
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:28,660
what it was for me anymore.

2697
02:29:28,660 --> 02:29:30,340
Pumpkin candles are all I get.

2698
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:34,020
Find the sugar free syrup all the time, by the way.

2699
02:29:34,020 --> 02:29:34,500
Yes.

2700
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:35,540
And I will get used to them.

2701
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:41,860
And I think I still have some from a grandpa care package from a year ago, but I will say

2702
02:29:41,860 --> 02:29:42,360
this.

2703
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:48,260
The Starbucks competitor Dutch Brothers here in this area is well stocked with sugar free

2704
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:48,740
syrups.

2705
02:29:48,740 --> 02:29:52,740
So I'm fully expecting they will have sugar free pumpkin.

2706
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:55,620
So I'll get to have my pumpkin here or there.

2707
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:57,460
And DGRMS brings up apple spice.

2708
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:03,460
The thing is, with as much as I got about the Rob loves everything pumpkin, people sometimes

2709
02:30:03,460 --> 02:30:04,100
forgot.

2710
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:06,180
I also love the apple stuff.

2711
02:30:06,180 --> 02:30:10,500
I also love the whatever drink that was the gingerbread, although I don't think they've

2712
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:13,460
had that for years, but I loved that when that was around.

2713
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:15,540
So just try this in the future.

2714
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:21,060
Get for anyone who liked the apple, get a tall chai latte and add one pump of the apple

2715
02:30:21,060 --> 02:30:21,560
to it.

2716
02:30:22,100 --> 02:30:23,220
It is a delight.

2717
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:25,460
Perfect.

2718
02:30:25,460 --> 02:30:26,180
All right.

2719
02:30:26,260 --> 02:30:29,780
So let's get everybody's final thoughts and then we'll wrap up.

2720
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:32,740
Dark Soccer, I know you probably want to use the restroom and stuff before you stream.

2721
02:30:32,740 --> 02:30:34,900
So why don't you give us your final thought tonight?

2722
02:30:36,580 --> 02:30:38,660
Fix the camping behavior.

2723
02:30:38,660 --> 02:30:43,860
Take my advice and just teleport killers away from the hook for 10 seconds after they've

2724
02:30:43,860 --> 02:30:46,500
hooked somebody and it will be perfect.

2725
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:47,300
The end.

2726
02:30:47,300 --> 02:30:53,300
I'm excited to see what that Rebecca perk does to the meta because they're definitely

2727
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:53,940
targeting that.

2728
02:30:53,940 --> 02:30:54,420
So we'll see.

2729
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:56,020
You might get your wish a little bit.

2730
02:30:56,020 --> 02:30:57,380
My favorite thing out of that though.

2731
02:30:57,380 --> 02:30:59,300
I hate the RPD is being split.

2732
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:00,660
I mean, I like the changes.

2733
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:04,020
They look good, but I like the full RPD because that is my pig map.

2734
02:31:05,140 --> 02:31:10,020
But Wesker has heat powers and I love it.

2735
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:14,180
And I was watching LC do survivor bowling with it.

2736
02:31:15,060 --> 02:31:17,700
Wesker's heat power is going to be very interesting in the full game.

2737
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:19,940
I'm excited to see Wesker's heat power is amazing.

2738
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:20,500
All right.

2739
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:21,060
Have a good stream.

2740
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:24,980
Hey, I forgot to say I forgot to say before, oh no, not for you.

2741
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:32,100
Just for in general, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please

2742
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:32,900
help us spread the word.

2743
02:31:32,900 --> 02:31:36,260
Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2744
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:38,500
but we need more voices to put out here on air.

2745
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:42,740
So leave a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you heard about

2746
02:31:42,740 --> 02:31:43,780
Orange Launch Radio.

2747
02:31:43,780 --> 02:31:46,020
All of that goes an awful long way as well.

2748
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:46,340
Okay.

2749
02:31:46,340 --> 02:31:48,020
I just want to make sure I say that as well.

2750
02:31:48,020 --> 02:31:49,060
I say it every week.

2751
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:53,300
It doesn't mean we get five star reviews, but I'm going to try, although I didn't check

2752
02:31:53,300 --> 02:31:54,260
the store in the last couple of weeks.

2753
02:31:54,260 --> 02:31:55,060
Maybe we did get one.

2754
02:31:55,060 --> 02:31:58,660
So Loki, do you have a final thought for tonight?

2755
02:31:58,660 --> 02:32:00,900
Um, yeah, I probably just try to stream more.

2756
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:01,940
You should.

2757
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:02,820
I can't wait to see it.

2758
02:32:02,820 --> 02:32:03,320
I hope you do.

2759
02:32:04,100 --> 02:32:04,600
Yeah.

2760
02:32:06,260 --> 02:32:09,860
My final thought, Dragon Con, two and a half weeks away.

2761
02:32:09,860 --> 02:32:11,300
Where did time go?

2762
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:16,100
Dragon Con, Twitch Con, a month after that.

2763
02:32:16,740 --> 02:32:18,980
And then, which yes, I'm going.

2764
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:20,340
And I heard about all the safety.

2765
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:22,980
I know I kept cutting those stories about the safety changes.

2766
02:32:23,060 --> 02:32:26,980
But yeah, they went back to being safe about it now.

2767
02:32:27,780 --> 02:32:29,220
It's whatever for me.

2768
02:32:29,220 --> 02:32:32,340
Like, you know, maybe I'm just riding this wave because I'm like, I had it.

2769
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:34,180
I'm immune for eight weeks now.

2770
02:32:34,180 --> 02:32:37,460
So, but I'm just like, if they want me to wear a mask, fine, I'll wear a mask.

2771
02:32:37,460 --> 02:32:43,940
But if not, like, we're getting to this point where it's like, what can you do at this point?

2772
02:32:43,940 --> 02:32:47,620
You just have to kind of hope the virus keeps mutating in a direction where it is getting

2773
02:32:47,620 --> 02:32:48,340
weaker and weaker.

2774
02:32:48,340 --> 02:32:52,180
And that's the good news is the one that everybody's getting is a lot weaker than what it used

2775
02:32:52,180 --> 02:32:52,740
to be.

2776
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:55,380
Not to minimize it, but it is.

2777
02:32:55,380 --> 02:32:56,580
Look at the stats anyway.

2778
02:32:58,260 --> 02:33:00,180
And then what was the other thing I was gonna say?

02:33:00,180 --> 02:33:03,140
Oh, then now I'm going to Seattle in November.

2780
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:04,820
So I'm really looking forward to that, though.

2781
02:33:04,820 --> 02:33:06,020
So, all right.

2782
02:33:06,820 --> 02:33:07,540
That's it.

2783
02:33:07,540 --> 02:33:09,380
Have a great night, everybody.

2784
02:33:09,380 --> 02:33:12,580
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2785
02:33:12,580 --> 02:33:14,260
Have a wonderful night.

2786
02:33:15,220 --> 02:33:15,620
Goodbye.
