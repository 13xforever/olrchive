00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Some people know of the very early Internet meme All Your Bass. Some of those people know that the game's sequence footage and translation text comes from a game called Zero Wing. But what everyone should know is that whether or not you've played it already, soon many more people will have a remastered version of it to play, including other titles by developer Toaplan. Sign me up.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,440
This is just one internet trend generating story. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 927 of our show for this August the 21st of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined every week by my co hosts say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

4
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,440
I'd better be the only I don't know maybe there's a DarkSakura out there in Michigan somewhere.

5
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:41,440
There actually was an evil Sakura for a while. And she actually dated Chris Tang, which is how I met him because I knew her. And the two of them came over, and he brought a like a CPS two unit for playing a Street Fighter and whatnot. And we played Bust to Move. That was how I learned about the game.

6
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,440
But um, but no, I was I was dark first. There's I was back before Capcom did it.

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:02:11,440
There's lots of Rob Roberts out there. There's I think once a rugby player, one owns a gun shop or something. If you look it up on if you look up Rob Roberts on YouTube, you get a gun person bunch of gun videos, which is like totally not me. And then I think there's a there's a politician in the UK who did a lot of shitty things from what I understand. So I've I've not haven't really followed it. But I'm like, Oh, great. I'm gonna get confused with that guy. So

8
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:33,440
so to point this out, there was, you know, Jamie Summers was spelled J. A. I. M. E. S. O. M. M. E. R. S. and that was a bionic woman. So I truly was named after. But there's, but I spell my J. A. M. I. E. S. U. M. M. E. R. S. because it's different. And there's also a porn star who does that. Of course, of course, of course, there's always a porn star.

9
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,980
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

10
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,160
My but my unmarried name.

11
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,680
Also,

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,920
matched

13
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,640
something. You know, you got to be careful because you want to give it away.

14
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,120
A friend's a former friend.

15
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,120
Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. I remember that.

16
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:03,420
He was spelled J. A. I. M. E. M. M. E. And for about a year, even after they broke up, and while they were together, I got his mail.

17
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,760
And he would get some of mine, which is very interesting.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,360
So, all right.

19
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,720
Also, say hello to the one and only.

20
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,960
There is no other.

21
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,800
Loki never, there is never heard that name used before anywhere.

22
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,000
No, no, it's completely original.

23
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
How are you doing, Loki?

24
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,720
I mean, licensing my properties, make TV shows and stuff, of course.

25
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,360
So. Well, I but the thing is, most people would probably assume

26
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,720
that you're Loki after the Marvel Loki and you're not.

27
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400
Yeah. And I embrace both. It's fine.

28
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,600
Yeah, that's that's good. That's good.

29
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
So the same thing with the Street Fighter character.

30
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,760
Oh, yeah. Although now people think it's from Naruto, but.

31
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,600
Well, no, I cosplayed.

32
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,680
No, actually, I didn't cosplay her. I cosplayed Tamari.

33
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,680
Well, when it comes to video games and people that have been doing

34
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,760
an online radio broadcast and podcast for way too long,

35
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,200
we really are the one and only Rob Robert, star soccer and Loki.

36
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,400
Get used to it. All right.

37
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,200
We got a lot in store for tonight.

38
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,720
A lot of gaming news to get into.

39
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,680
Let's why don't we just get right into our kickoff topic for tonight,

40
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,440
which is a story that has been making the rounds quite a bit this week.

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,920
Do you want to get into this, Loki?

42
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,520
You want me to tackle this?

43
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
Because I got a lot to say about it, but.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,160
I mean, yeah, if you want to get into it, it's fine.

45
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,280
OK, there's not much to it.

46
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,600
So Spider-Man Remastered just came out on PC.

47
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
So, you know, a lot of the Sony games are getting their PC releases. Right.

48
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,880
So Spider-Man Remastered, of course, one of the big

49
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,200
releases of the PlayStation four and five era. Right.

50
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,400
So this has been a long awaited release on PC. And what does it mean?

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,800
What is the big thing that happens when a game releases on PC

52
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,960
from console that it didn't get on console, it gets on PC?

53
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
Why do a lot of people want it on PC?

54
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,080
Modding, mods, mods, mods. That's right.

55
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,520
All the mods you can think of.

56
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
And, you know, every everything you can think of was done in this game as well.

57
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,280
You know, especially the quote unquote obvious things.

58
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,240
Things like alternate Spider-Man skins.

59
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,440
You want to make Spider-Man look like Miles Morales Spider-Man.

60
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,040
Yes, of course, you can do that through mods and so on and so on.

61
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,880
So with mods, the possibilities are endless.

62
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,480
But I think you some of you that follow gaming culture

63
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,600
and gaming social media, you probably know exactly what's coming up next.

64
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,280
So on August 15th, a user on Nexus mods by the name of Mike Hawk.

65
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,800
Because the year is 1989,

66
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,360
and this is a phone call on The Simpsons to Moe's Tavern, clearly.

67
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,840
Mike Hawk on Nexus uploaded a mod for Spider-Man Remastered

68
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,400
that replaces Newton's prism artifacts

69
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
with the stars and stripes.

70
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
That's what the description said.

71
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,560
That was its way of getting around keywords to basically say

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,360
it took all of the rainbow flags that because the Spider-Man

73
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,960
remaster game has a very accurate depiction of New York City

74
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,720
and you know, the big diversity that you see in New York City.

75
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,920
And it replaced the rainbow flag or the pride flags with American flags.

76
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,840
Of which there are plenty.

77
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,960
Of which there were, which already existed.

78
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,600
Thank you for clarifying that, because that's important.

79
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,680
Which already existed in the game.

80
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,320
So long story short, I'm sure you were never expecting Mike Hawk

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,920
to do this type of juvenile stuff online.

82
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,240
But there you go.

83
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,760
And this, of course, as you can imagine, opened up a big old can of worms,

84
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,160
because obviously, you know, it's interesting

85
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,760
because there's a lot of times with mods we ask ourselves, what's the point?

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Like, you know, when it's like, you know, nudie mods and what's the point?

87
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,680
You know, and a lot of times it's because we can.

88
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,560
But with this one, no, really.

89
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,520
What's the point of doing this?

90
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,600
And a lot of people are saying it's hate.

91
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,840
It's erasure. It's ridiculous.

92
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,320
Nexus mods was kind of forced to intervene, as you can imagine.

93
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,000
They had to quickly remove the mod and banned the creator.

94
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,640
And they found that the creator had made a sock puppet account to do this.

95
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,000
And Nexus mods in a blog post said the fact that the user needed to make

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,280
a sock puppet like a coward to upload the mod showed their intent to troll.

97
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,800
The creation of the sock puppet removed any doubt and made it

98
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,720
a very easy decision for us.

99
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,160
Both of the sock puppet account and the user's main account have been banned.

100
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,720
Of course, we're saying that if if he had done it on his main account,

101
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,720
he would have just gotten a warning

102
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400
and had the mod taken down and then banned if it went back up. Right.

103
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,400
But it was very clear.

104
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,160
I love that they minced no words, especially

105
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,920
if this doesn't suit your morality.

106
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,080
Here's how to delete your account.

107
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,920
That would. Yeah.

108
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,640
Nexus mods. Beautiful.

109
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,680
I'm a fan of zero fucks.

110
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,040
Alan uses Alan mods games a lot, and he is a heavy user of Nexus mods.

111
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,520
And I support that 100 percent.

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,560
You remember how my Mass Effect 3 looked because I downloaded

113
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,000
the high res mods and my Dragon Age mods and all of that.

114
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,280
Unfortunately, once on the Internet, always on the Internet.

115
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,720
And so the mods out there, we know that it was on the Internet

116
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,680
archive at one point, but I think that it got pulled from there, too.

117
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,480
But, you know, it's it's it's out there.

118
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,840
It's that people put a lot of modding sites took it down.

119
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,360
Unfortunately, because of a lot of this controversy.

120
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,840
Now that just makes people want to install it more, you know,

121
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,520
because people want to be edgy.

122
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,800
And in their comments on Twitter, they like to talk about,

123
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,280
oh, the snowflakes are triggered because we were moved their pride flags.

124
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,120
And they're they hate America.

125
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,480
They hate America because they can't stand to see the American flag.

126
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,920
I have a different take on that.

127
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,360
You see, you are using the American flag

128
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,040
in this mod for your act of coward, cowardice.

129
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,440
You are hiding behind the American flag

130
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,560
and you are allowing the American flag to be a symbol of cowardice.

131
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,760
That is what you're doing.

132
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,840
You are being offensive towards this American flag symbol.

133
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,320
I mean, we all know this argument is absolutely ridiculous.

134
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,840
It's absolutely ridiculous.

135
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,080
It's like putting a child in a shirt that says fuck you

136
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,560
and then sending that child to Disneyland and then going,

137
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,040
why would Disney kick a child out of Disneyland?

138
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,440
I don't understand.

139
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,800
Why does Disney hate children?

140
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,960
Or in another wonderful Internet brainchild moment,

141
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,760
it's like going into a PetSmart and yelling at the employees about

142
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,320
why do they have pride stuff up at a PetSmart

143
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,280
and why does PetSmart support all this bullshit that people want to tie

144
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,360
to LGBT stuff like pedophilia and all this garbage.

145
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,000
Stop making my frogs gay, damn it.

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,040
Damn you, PetSmart.

147
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,520
They did witness a rant like that once.

148
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,440
No, I know. That's why I specifically called that out.

149
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,080
But the employee was awesome.

150
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
Oh, no. Yeah, they were awesome.

151
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,320
And like. No, you weren't there for this.

152
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,400
This is. Oh, this is an Alabama PetSmart.

153
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,320
Oh, I'm talking about the PetSmart video I saw.

154
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,360
Sorry. Go ahead. No, no, no.

155
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,840
I'm talking about when I personally witnessed. Oh, OK.

156
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,680
And the the person's going off, this is God.

157
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,920
And employees like, here's the corporate address.

158
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,440
Talk to them. I'm on my break.

159
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,800
I don't get people like it's just like

160
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
just who cares?

161
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,440
Like like if it bothers you, just whatever you like.

162
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,480
It's not that being included in the game is not really.

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,640
What's it doing to you?

164
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,840
Like, stop.

165
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,440
I think their take are these types of people.

166
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,960
Their take is like they're shoving it down my throat.

167
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,160
Well, yeah, but like because, of course, it's all projection

168
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,280
and typically the projection of this stuff that they're doing.

169
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,840
I mean, like you're shoving that super American pride down

170
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
to everybody's throats as well.

171
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,520
Not that it's right.

172
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,960
It's really just bigotry, but, you know, whatever you want to call it.

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,520
I mean, it's the same thing.

174
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,720
It's just. I don't know.

175
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,240
Like put it this way.

176
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,560
It's like trans, you know, gay, straight.

177
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,120
I mean, well, pretty much anyone non-binary.

178
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,320
I mean, they're not like trying to come after you.

179
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,440
I mean, they're just trying to live their damn lives and just. Yeah.

180
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,200
You know, exist and maybe get the same type of freedoms

181
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,720
and rights as everybody else.

182
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,640
And God forbid, you know, everybody's like, well, the Bible says like,

183
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,080
as that's the only, you know, dictator of everything in the world.

184
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,840
You know, of course.

185
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,040
Royale says that I can get trapped on an island and kill my schoolmates.

186
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,520
That's a big book.

187
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,480
It's it's technically both both are technically books.

188
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,320
And correct. Both are books.

189
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,240
You know, if I if I learn how to,

190
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,480
you know, shoot an arrow through 10 holes,

191
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,120
then I can get a hot Greek wife named Penelope.

192
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,880
I'm I am happy to let Loki continue his rant here.

193
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,800
I am happy to let an ally

194
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,200
say it the way it needs to be heard.

195
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,640
Like, it's so stupid, like just the the downright evil stuff

196
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,960
that like certain spectrums of the political,

197
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,680
I guess, you know, the Republicans, we're just going to say it.

198
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,880
They just going after people like in their basic rights

199
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,160
and trying to strip them away from them, thinking that, oh, you know, save us.

200
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,040
Oh, they're trying to teach our kids to be gay.

201
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,960
They're trying to teach our kids to change their genders like.

202
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,080
No, they're not.

203
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,120
But these are the same people that are saying, you know, like, oh, hey, rock

204
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
music's trying to make you worship the devil.

205
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,920
Oh, hey, your comic books are trying to, you know.

206
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,120
Corrupt your mind and also worship the devil, I'm sure.

207
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,760
I mean, it's just

208
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,600
when will these people just die?

209
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,840
When will they just die off already?

210
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,760
Like, come on.

211
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,440
It all comes down to control, though. Control and money.

212
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
It is. It actually is.

213
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,640
It's it's controlling the narrative, which is exactly what they're trying

214
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,800
to do in this situation, because they're turning this,

215
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
you know, shutting down of pride flags and the pride movement into

216
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,200
why do you hate America?

217
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,280
That's exactly what it is.

218
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,160
And it's this whole it's it's the whole, you know, what?

219
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
Why do you keep shoving that gay shit down my throat,

220
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,320
says individual walking into a pet smart, holding a camera,

221
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,880
trying to live for a matter of black lives.

222
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,440
My counter to them is why do you hate America?

223
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,680
Thank you. Thank you.

224
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,960
Because that's exactly what it is, because when you're using the American flag

225
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,000
to to hide your cowardness behind,

226
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,080
you are the ones who are the ball lickers

227
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,360
or the people with the, you know, to quote, it's basically

228
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,840
butchering the American flag to put the blue line on it.

229
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,040
You know, yeah, it's this, but no,

230
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,560
it isn't necessarily to control the narrative as well, especially,

231
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,400
you know, anyone with a uterus knows this very well,

232
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,640
is that it goes to controlling people.

233
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,880
To have a population that will support their interests

234
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,480
so that they can remain in power.

235
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,960
Women, I'm just going to use women in general right now, just loose term.

236
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,400
For example, yeah, we do have a lot more going for us now than we did.

237
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,000
And we are kind of taking over a lot of things.

238
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,000
And this has been considered male dominated territory.

239
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,960
Well, same thing is also going on with, quote, heterosexual territory

240
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,240
that and it's not that there are suddenly magically more gay,

241
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,600
more trans, more ace, whatever people.

242
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,160
The fact that the people are not hiding that anymore.

243
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,560
And and and, you know,

244
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,920
they want to go back

245
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,440
to an era where their type was in control

246
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,800
and they weren't the ones dying out and losing their control.

247
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,120
That's all that it is.

248
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,720
It's exactly why they remove certain pieces

249
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,440
of education from school curriculums, for example.

250
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,160
Think back to in terms I'm going to say like dark ages,

251
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,080
that general era where the only people who were educated were rich males.

252
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,880
Even women were rich, women were rarely educated

253
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,280
and the the general populace, if they didn't have money, they can get educated.

254
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,800
They were going to work

255
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,320
because an educated population is something those in power fear.

256
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,800
Yeah, that's why they're trying to promote non education, like even now

257
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,960
they have, was it in Florida where they pass the bill where they can

258
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,440
let just untrained veterans teach children now, which is fine.

259
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,040
You know, like, I'm sure those people are nice, but.

260
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,680
They're not teachers, they haven't gone through the training to do that, like.

261
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,520
Well, and the other thing, too, though, is that, you know,

262
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,640
what does it say, the the the victors write the history?

263
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,320
Oh, no, history is written by the victors, that's the phrase.

264
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,600
And they are teaching these these revisionist histories in school, which is.

265
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,640
Like, if I didn't have teachers that were really open minded and said,

266
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,400
no, what your your book says is wrong, this is what happened.

267
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,400
Then I might not be the thinker that I am today.

268
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,760
And this is something, you know, especially then with a lot of

269
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm going to throw Internet culture in on this, too,

270
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,200
because it's also a big factor in this matter,

271
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,360
is when you've got people spreading a false narrative and passing on,

272
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:18,240
you know, hearsay and oh, so and so said this, it must be true.

273
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,560
Or I heard, I heard, I heard.

274
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,120
Or this tribal knowledge, for lack of a better description,

275
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,160
as fact, when indeed it's not necessarily fact, it's half truths.

276
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,520
But it's just enough out there to be detrimental

277
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,040
to the growth of society in general and create these.

278
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,640
Pockets of hatred, if you know what I mean.

279
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,920
Whereas someone who is who's educated,

280
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,720
who's been at an experience that, hey, no, it's not really like this.

281
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,840
They should be speaking up and going, no, no, you're completely wrong.

282
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,200
You know, I had another point that I was going to make,

283
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,040
but right now I'm too disgusted.

284
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,520
If I could quickly, I want to acknowledge our live chat,

285
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,680
because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern,

286
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,200
six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv

287
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,280
slash Avog Network.

288
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,400
And you can chat along.

289
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,800
And a great part of the show and why we do this

290
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,080
is that you all get to have your voices heard in chat

291
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,040
or solicited through email and Twitter throughout the week.

292
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,440
And we have a lot of great comments in chat,

293
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,720
just a lot of support for what's being said here.

294
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,080
And, you know, thank you. I appreciate it.

295
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,360
Because, you know, I've heard I've certainly heard over the years

296
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,520
people who are on the political ideology spectrum different than we are.

297
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,840
And there comes a point like I do try to understand, I do try to listen.

298
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,480
I try to educate and not attack. I really do.

299
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,840
But there comes a point and especially after doing this for 20 years,

300
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,680
you know, we've done this show for now 20 years.

301
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,080
We've we've by far hit that point where it's like

302
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,160
I am too old and I am too tired for this bullshit.

303
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,760
And when it is my identity being attacked, which is what this is.

304
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,680
This is what this is.

305
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,840
And using an American flag to hide behind that attack.

306
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,880
Yeah, I'm fucking pissed off.

307
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,680
And yeah, I'm going to talk about it.

308
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,160
And no, I'm not going to shut my mouth because you have a problem with it,

309
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,920
because, you know, deep down, I'm right.

310
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,120
What I'm going to do real quick in chat,

311
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,400
and I'm sorry about this to our listeners,

312
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,080
to listeners, you owe it to yourself to go look this up,

313
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,200
is I am putting up a list of logical fallacies.

314
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,360
Mm hmm. How to spot a logical fallacy in an argument,

315
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,640
because a lot of these people who are doing religion

316
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,480
or society or this, that and the other is their excuses.

317
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,040
They're logical fallacies.

318
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,000
It's like saying, oh,

319
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,840
this person with sunglasses caused a car accident.

320
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,440
I guess we need to ban sunglasses.

321
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,520
You know, or yeah.

323
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,800
And and I think the thing I hear all the time,

324
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm OK with gay people as long as they don't hit on me.

325
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,920
Why would someone hit on you

326
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,560
on behalf of your token gay friend in your circle or whatever?

327
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,320
Allow me allow me to say this.

328
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,800
Don't flatter yourself.

329
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,840
Period. Or or or this one, too.

330
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,680
You know what, what?

331
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,400
And I'm assuming that the person saying this would be male,

332
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,600
because I hear that more often.

333
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,160
What if what if your lady friend tried to hit on you?

334
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,880
It'd be exactly the same thing if you're not into her.

335
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,880
You say no. End of story.

336
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,640
It would probably be the only time that individual got hit on by a lady.

337
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,680
Anyway, I'm not going to go there. All right.

338
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,720
Well, now I'm being cheap.

339
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,200
I'm going below the bell. That's not nice.

340
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,480
I remember one of my uncles was like,

341
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,440
they better not come anywhere near me or I'd like Uncle Wayne.

342
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,000
No one wants to be around you, not even your family.

343
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,080
Yeah, I said that that was actually the last time I spoke to my uncle.

344
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,040
Pod culture and chat says, hell, I would be flattered.

345
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,880
Nobody wants to hit on me that it's very easy to say, oh, thank you.

346
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,560
I'm not interested, but I appreciate that compliment.

347
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,440
Wow. How hard was that?

348
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,520
There's an episode of Sailor Moon in Japan. Yeah.

349
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,600
Where this one girl has like a little crush on Usagi.

350
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,840
And Usagi very gently turns her down and says,

351
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,240
but let's be let's be friends and mean it, you know. Yeah.

352
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,200
It's that right there.

353
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,480
I mean, yeah, it's a show for, you know, for preteen girls.

354
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,880
Mostly that was the target age group.

355
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,000
But to put it so simply and easily there.

356
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,640
That's it. Or that other meme that goes around from Deep Space Nine

357
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,640
of of Curzon and Jadzia.

358
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,560
He goes, not Curzon, Curzon was her previous life.

359
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,480
Gauran is saying, it's like, Curzon, my old friend.

360
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,200
He goes, oh, I'm Jadzia now.

361
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,800
Oh, Jadzia, my old friend.

362
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,040
You know that like I love that scene.

363
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,680
I fucking love Deep Space Nine anyway.

364
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,800
But but I mean, it can be that easy.

365
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,920
Just love people.

366
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,440
You know, I mean, I don't love those people, but I'm saying.

367
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,160
Be just be a good person, you know, just

368
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,880
stop trying to inflict your world view on other people.

369
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,040
Now, I back to the golden rule, the Internet, don't be a dick.

370
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,400
I'm going to go, though, into one little piece of psychology,

371
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,240
and there is something about what's considered a core belief.

372
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,280
And these are, you know, like for the people that you introduce

373
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,240
proof of something that shakes a formative thought, a formative belief.

374
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,480
Then it actually does cause like a

375
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,200
sort of a psychological.

376
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,360
Thing, I can't really explain that.

377
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,400
I mean, this word seizure comes to mind, but it's not that just sort of like

378
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,680
a momentary shutdown because it goes against an ingrained

379
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,040
core belief, something that makes them who they are.

380
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,800
So in from a psychological standpoint, yes, I understand

381
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
the change is very difficult and it takes a very long time.

382
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,920
And you have to be able to recognize that you could be wrong

383
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,800
and be willing to make the change. Yeah.

384
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,360
But when you have an entire group of people with this core belief,

385
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,400
and I'm going to say it right now,

386
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,320
the Southern Baptist Church is a cult. I grew up in it.

387
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,280
But when you have when you have that going on,

388
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,000
you need to work on the narrative around it

389
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,920
and bring it into their purview in such a way

390
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:05,320
that it's going to start shifting that core thought, that core value.

391
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,720
It's not going to happen all at once.

392
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,120
As much as people want to say, as much as people think a big debate

393
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,240
is going to go on, it's going to have to happen gradually.

394
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,400
And on a societal level is something that Loki brought up earlier.

395
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,960
They're going to die out.

396
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,200
We already see now, even for some of these hardcore people,

397
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,400
a level of acceptance that they that their predecessors would not have had.

398
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,160
There's some younger younger

399
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,160
folks out there that are very loud and even crazier.

400
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,080
So like, I hope they all die out.

401
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,960
But some and somebody I just I kept not reading these chat comments.

402
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,160
Sorry, because we kept having other thoughts.

403
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,440
But Mike Defton chat earlier said the thing is, even if those people die,

404
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,240
their teaching still continues with their offspring. Right.

405
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,800
So it's education is is the big thing.

406
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,240
And there's a lot of people out there that need one.

407
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,520
And that's why I was saying the narrative needs to change

408
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,360
and be presented differently.

409
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,800
That if exposure

410
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,680
is already going to be a big factor in making change.

411
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,520
I know we're getting a little away from the topic

412
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,920
that it's kind of started this whole thing, however.

413
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,320
And I want to point this out, just like when we went on a rant

414
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,680
on our 20th anniversary episode

415
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,960
about what was happening to women's rights, this country and everything.

416
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,200
I want to I want to make this very clear.

417
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,280
Does this relate to gaming? 100 percent? Absolutely.

418
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,120
Yes, it does. Because remember, we don't just talk about video games,

419
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,560
gaming news and gaming culture. And this.

420
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,560
Mentality.

421
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,440
Has a cycle of infecting gaming culture regularly.

422
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,000
Mm hmm. And it needs to stop it all the time.

423
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
I dealt with it today on freaking Twitter.

424
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,560
It's just. Yeah.

425
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,520
So if you if you feel we dedicated too much time to this topic, too bad,

426
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,200
because we waste too much time reading this bullshit on social media

427
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,480
all of the time and it needs to stop.

428
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,040
On that note, let's talk about the types of games

429
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,160
that we've been playing this week, what games we're drowning our sorrows in.

430
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,280
No, I mean, honestly, yes, that that story pissed me off.

431
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,080
But otherwise, you know what?

432
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,200
I'm not going to let some bitch bring me down.

433
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,360
I had a good week.

434
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,240
I'm going to continue to have a great month.

435
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm thriving. Those people are idiots.

436
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,520
I don't care. So moving on.

437
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,920
How was your gaming week?

438
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,480
How are you thriving in video games this week?

439
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,800
How are you making somebody mad?

440
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,720
Dark Sakura, by being a woman daring to play video games

441
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,240
on her own terms, this mostly woman.

442
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,440
Well, OK, yes.

443
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,560
I I played a bunch of Dead by Daylight.

444
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,480
I played with Finara.

445
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,560
I actually went back and played a little bit of Killer

446
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,960
and I ended up just making it like a fun farming match

447
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,120
because of all the stinky other killers that have been around.

448
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,360
So I did like that, you know, the doctor thing

449
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,200
where you have to shock four people and then you're good.

450
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,320
Like the daily.

451
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,120
I did that and then I went around and making them drop pallets on me

452
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,920
so I could bust those pallets and finish the pallet breaking challenge as well.

453
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,560
And, you know, it was just I tried to be like non stinky.

454
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,800
I don't care if I quote lose.

455
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,560
I don't play for my level.

456
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,600
I don't play for points.

457
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,680
I don't play to win a play to have fun.

458
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,400
And a lot of killers out there have been assholes

459
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,640
and just not letting people have fun or ending the game too quickly

460
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,400
or camping and tunneling people out.

461
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,480
And I'm I went in to play just to to have fun,

462
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,240
just to be silly, just to let other people have a break from the garbage,

463
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,320
you know, and then get blood points for it.

464
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,040
Um, and and I also played with

465
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,440
Franklish eight, who's another streamer who.

466
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,760
We had a lot of fun. It was just really random.

467
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,760
I kind of was like not in the mood to play Final Fantasy.

468
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,240
So we started Final Fantasy four and then we went and played.

469
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,720
That was really fun.

470
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,040
And I got to play with intoxicated.

471
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,160
And walking disaster, few streamers, really fun people.

472
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,120
Um, and then, um, last Sunday, I did buy Cult of the Lamb

473
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,440
and I've got it all set up.

474
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,640
I just need to install the extension for for Twitch.

475
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,000
And, um, I also played a little bit more hooked on you.

476
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,480
But for some reason, it didn't record that I had the hours on it.

477
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,640
So it must be like a glitch on Twitch or something.

478
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,120
Actually, it would be in my Windows partition.

479
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,240
Um, I did, I did.

480
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,880
Oh, I'm playing word scapes that I hit over level 100,000.

481
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
I think it is.

482
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,680
Hold on, maybe level 10,000, but I played a lot of it

483
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,440
and I enjoy that stupid little game.

484
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,280
It's a lot of fun.

485
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,800
Um, I am also, I think right now, a fourth place in tournament mode.

486
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,840
OK, I'm on one on ten thousand three hundred and forty nine that level.

487
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,720
Um, I am also playing Final Fantasy four.

488
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:29,600
Um, I, uh, Cecil has just become a paladin and we're going to rescue, uh, Rosa.

489
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,880
And I'm, I'm having a lot of fun with that too.

490
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,040
Um, I got, uh, Palom and Porom.

491
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,760
Oh, I love them.

492
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,080
The brat kids.

493
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah, I love them.

494
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,520
Uh, well, only one of them is really a brat.

495
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,760
The other one's a little too nice, but I love the thwap.

496
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,720
I forgot about the thwapping on the head.

497
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,040
Every time, uh, uh, Porom says something rude, Palom comes over and goes,

498
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,840
Thwap, and you hear the pop noise in the game.

499
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
I had forgotten about that.

500
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,880
Um, and, uh, now the thing is I'm playing a translation from the

501
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,400
Japanese version with no censorship, like the uncensored sprites and everything.

502
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,120
So I, I missed the spoonie Bard line.

503
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,560
The line that he said was like, you son of a bitch, you know, which is

504
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,800
probably a little bit more accurate.

505
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,280
And it talks like more about people dying and, and, you know, mass

506
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,960
attacks and burying their dead.

507
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,480
It's, it's definitely a lot more gritty.

508
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,760
Um, but it's still, I still love the game.

509
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,600
Um, and I'm considering final fantasy five next, either that or maybe star ocean.

510
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,480
Okay.

511
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,520
Yeah.

512
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,120
Um, but we'll see.

513
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,400
And yeah.

514
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,080
All right.

515
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,400
Uh, let's go over to Loki.

516
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,240
Talk about your gaming week.

517
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,600
Loki.

518
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,040
Um, still my craft.

519
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,960
Uh, we did do a live stream though yesterday, so that was cool.

520
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,520
I got to participate that.

521
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,960
So we did a stream day, uh, for the whole channel 64 server.

522
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,840
And we were streaming, I think like almost 14 hours.

523
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,840
Wow.

524
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

525
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,320
We had like about, I think eight people participate.

526
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,880
So that was pretty nice.

527
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,200
We each had like a two hour block.

528
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,320
It was fun.

529
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,200
You know, I launched pillagers in the space with a flying machine and I, uh, what

530
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,440
else?

531
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,400
Oh, just.

532
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,480
Messed around on the server a little bit.

533
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,600
Um, didn't really have too much, uh, planned out.

534
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,400
Although this week I may want to stream again.

535
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,240
Um, because St Rose coming out.

536
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,160
Yeah, big deal.

537
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:42,080
And also, uh, you know, arcade paradise, the game that's playing behind me, um, is

538
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,960
another game that I want to check out as well.

539
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,080
It looks pretty cool.

540
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,760
It's like a SIM game where you're running a laundromat that you're, I think trying to

541
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,120
convert over to an arcade.

542
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,480
Yeah.

543
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,920
Um, so it's pretty cool.

544
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,200
Nice.

545
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,040
All right.

546
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,160
Um, my game a week, a lot of the usual stuff still dead by daylight, Final Fantasy 14,

547
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,040
really excited.

548
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,720
Uh, we get a patch very soon for Final Fantasy 14.

549
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
So I'm excited for that.

550
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,360
Um, I actually played some other random stuff this week, the outside of my norm.

551
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,640
So, um, uh, Alan has been recently kind of into pinball games again on the PC he was

552
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,000
playing.

553
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,880
I just, I was watching over his shoulder.

554
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,760
He was playing the, um, which collection was it?

555
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,440
Not, not pinball FX, but the other one.

556
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:28,840
Um, of course the name, uh, no, cause that's where pinball FX started was in pinball.

557
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,240
It's the other companies like arcade treasures, pinball arcade.

558
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,000
Thank you, Bobby.

559
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,000
It's pinball arcade.

560
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,760
So pinball arcade had all the Williams licenses in it.

561
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,520
So I was watching him playing the Elvira tables that he bought a long time ago in that, um,

562
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,400
collection.

563
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,800
But you know, a few years ago, I think it was like 2018, the licenses moved.

564
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,320
So he's still playing in the old one because of course once you buy it, they can't take it away from you.

565
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,240
So you still play it there.

566
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,880
But now pinball FX has a lot of those like Bally midway table licenses.

567
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:03,800
So, um, it actually kind of made me go, Oh, I kind of want to check out, like, I forgot pinball FX, like was supposed to be having a new

568
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,200
version because I was like, whatever happened to that series?

569
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,800
They have pinball FX three, and then I haven't heard anything since then.

570
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:15,400
Well, they're rebooting basically into pinball FX and it is out in early release on the Epic game store.

571
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:23,480
Um, and I believe it's going to come out steam and the other platforms to, uh, uh, the consoles when it actually releases.

572
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,280
Don't quote me on that.

573
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,400
I can't remember if the steam part is, um, but it is a free to play.

574
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,400
Um, Oh, thank you, Bob.

575
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,560
Bobby says steam will be a year after Epic game store.

576
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,400
Well, I think it started in like June or something.

577
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,480
So I downloaded it to check it out.

578
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,040
And, uh, the, the kind of unfortunate part is that they don't have all of the tables moved over yet.

579
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:50,400
Um, and, and they're like, for example, those Elvira tables, uh, that Alan has, you can't get those in the new pinball FX.

580
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,480
I don't think they were ever in pinball FX three either.

581
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,440
So there are some licensed tables in there.

582
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:01,680
In fact, there's quite a few, I shouldn't even say some, um, but you can't get the vast amount of library that the other games had built up.

583
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,400
And they're having to redo it basically from where they were at and pinball FX three, because this is an all new engine.

584
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,720
I believe it's capable of four K and does Ray tracing and all this other stuff.

585
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,080
And yeah, Bobby's talking about how your purchases actually don't transfer over from FX three.

586
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,800
So they're kind of committing to supporting both, but it isn't, it is an odd reboot for the series.

587
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,200
But here, here's the, I know I can see why they're doing it.

588
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:39,320
They're doing it because another model now that they have in here is a subscription where you can subscribe and get all the tables or most of them for a low, low monthly price to, uh, so, uh, I'm sure that's one big reason they want to move that direction.

589
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,160
And, uh, everything is like you buy tickets and then use tickets to buy the tables and this type of thing, but they do have free tables.

590
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:53,640
So like one of my favorite pinball tables, the Arabian nights table happened to be the free one on Friday or Saturday.

591
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,600
So I was able to play it and check it out a little bit.

592
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,960
And I had played another one too.

593
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,480
There was a space, I think it was called space station or something as a pinball table.

594
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,280
There was a free game at some point as well.

595
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,440
So I was checking those out.

596
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,280
So it is nice that they rotate through a couple of free tables.

597
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,640
So you can really kind of check it out.

598
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:16,200
Um, it also, I guess part of what they've done with pinball FX is like, now you have a pinball room that you can, uh, you know, collect things and build out in.

599
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,080
Yeah, it's one of those, but I, I didn't understand how to use it.

600
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,640
And I don't know if that's just because I didn't really pay any money for anything yet.

601
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,120
Uh, it didn't really seem that intuitive to use.

602
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,840
I could like change the carpet.

603
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,960
And that was about, I don't know, it doesn't, I didn't really have a lot to do with it, but whatever.

604
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,840
It's really about the pinball at the end of the day.

605
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,960
Um, it looks nice, uh, very nice resolution, very crisp, but it's just kind of a bummer.

606
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,080
It's like they have to rebuild the whole thing.

607
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,920
Um, Bobby Blackwell says they did release the Indiana Jones table on FX three.

608
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,080
Yeah.

609
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,680
And it's $15 if you want that table on a pinball effects.

610
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,160
So I'm, but I imagine Harris's Ford Harrison Ford's likeness probably isn't cheap.

611
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,520
So it is what it is.

612
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,000
One of those for a little bit.

613
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,320
And then we, I think we sold it to get a different table.

614
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,720
Yeah.

615
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,280
So anyway, I mean, to, to get, download it for free.

616
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,760
Sure.

617
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,520
And check it out.

618
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:09,760
Sure.

619
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,640
It was, it was cute.

620
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,160
It was fun.

621
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,080
I don't know if I'll be buying any tables anytime real soon, but I'll keep an eye.

622
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,560
I'll keep an eye on what they're offering in there.

623
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,560
They had, is it bride of pin bot was what they, they didn't have regular pin bot, but they had bride of pin bot, which I thought was interesting.

624
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,360
So, all right.

625
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,280
Um, let's see other games I played this week.

626
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,200
So I randomly played Mario Kart eight.

627
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,760
I was, uh, out last night.

628
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,480
I ended up going out to San Francisco last night.

629
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:39,120
I was hanging out with listener and participant JD, uh, you know, goes way back with the show and the, the, the Monty days and all that stuff.

630
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,920
And we were playing Mario Kart eight last night.

631
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,720
So I finally got to see all these extra tracks.

632
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,040
I just hadn't gotten around to playing yet.

633
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,760
So we did some races on Waluigi pinball and the, the, um, Calamari desert.

634
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,960
Is that what it's called for the N64, the one with the train, uh, plot twist, the last lap forces you to go on the train tracks.

635
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,000
I remember that was the thing you could do on the N64, but now like, that's the, the last lap.

636
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,760
You have to drive down the train tracks, which is a very interesting, yeah.

637
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,160
They, they made some cool changes like that.

638
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,560
Sorry, spoiler alert.

639
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,000
But that track has been out for a few weeks.

640
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,640
I got to play those.

641
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,320
Like we have the DLC for it.

642
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,920
I don't think I've updated it though.

643
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,280
Yeah, you should check it out.

644
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,760
They're good.

645
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,280
Uh, so yeah, I had fun with that.

646
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:29,600
And then random, we went into the classic super Nintendo library and we were playing paddle DePone last night over the weird thing is, so you have to still do it through the internet.

647
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,120
We couldn't just connect to each other cause we were in the same room.

648
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,480
We had to do it through the internet, but we were able to play, um, paddle DePone, which is basically it's Tetris attack.

649
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,400
It's Pokemon puzzle league, but on the super Nintendo.

650
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,800
We were playing that against each other.

651
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,160
He, he would be in that though.

652
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,520
I, I have, I'm out of practice.

653
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
I haven't played in a long time.

654
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,960
So that was, uh, yeah, so, but that was fun.

655
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,400
So I got to play some stuff that is a little outside of my norm for gaming week.

656
00:37:51,400 --> 00:38:01,320
So, uh, hoping to continue that trend as we move on throughout the week and, uh, get into, uh, closer and closer to dragon con is coming up real soon.

657
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,480
Um, I should talk a little bit here about dragon con and what's going on there.

658
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:11,240
So, uh, we will not be here in two weeks, um, because dragon con is happening that weekend.

659
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:28,000
And as the case has been for, I want to say the last 10 years now, I mean, I don't know if, I don't think we get to count the year that the pandemic happened and it was all virtual, but otherwise for like the past 10 years, cause 2012 was my first year I've been heading out to dragon con every labor day weekend.

660
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,440
So, uh, this year I'm going out again and the app was updated this week.

661
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,960
So I can tell you about my schedule.

662
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:43,440
So, uh, here's where I'm going to be appearing at dragon con Friday at one o'clock, uh, diversity in video games.

663
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
Why representation matters.

664
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,760
I'll be moderating that panel, uh, for the video game track.

665
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,760
Uh, I did a similar one last year and it was a great discussion.

666
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,640
So I'm excited about that.

667
00:38:51,920 --> 00:39:02,640
Uh, two 30 on Friday, thriving on streaming media after 40, I couldn't fit the full name on my little flyer, but it's how do you do fellow kids thriving on streaming media after 40.

668
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,680
So that's, uh, that's the, that's the name of that panel.

669
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
I'm going to be on that with Bobby black Wolf.

670
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,520
Um, and, uh, but he's only 29.

671
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,600
That doesn't seem right.

672
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,320
I, I think he snuck his way onto it.

673
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,640
Like a lot of these kids do.

674
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,160
So, um, everyone's always trying to be an adult.

675
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,760
There's some other famous podcasts, like legit famous podcasting face.

676
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,080
So there, I don't follow a lot of this, this stuff, but the, the macro brothers are on this panel.

677
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,920
So am I have friends that listen to them and really enjoy them?

678
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:41,880
Um, so, uh, apparently it's, it's, it's a big deal and I know that I know they have a lot of fans, so that's, that's going to be a, certainly a sold out wall to wall type of thing.

679
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,280
Uh, so that'll be exciting.

680
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:51,600
Uh, let's see also, uh, uh, on the agenda, um, we have on a Saturday at two 30.

681
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,680
Oh, Bobby points out too.

682
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
He's the moderator of that panel.

683
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,720
So maybe he doesn't have to be 40 to moderate it.

684
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,000
I guess that's, that's the deal.

685
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,600
Maybe a Saturday at two 30, this is new for me.

686
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,880
Uh, I'll be making my first appearance on the horror track.

687
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,000
Uh, and that's something I've been kind of hinting at for a couple of weeks that I'm doing something new this year.

688
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And I'm really excited.

689
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:20,320
Um, a lot of, you know, that, um, outside of doing, you know, video game commenting and broadcasting and all that stuff, um, I do stuff with a horror hosting and I've, I've done some stuff here locally.

690
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,160
We did a great lost boys tribute with some of the stars in the movie.

691
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,320
We did a twin peaks event in January with some of the stars.

692
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,680
So I've been getting to, to do more and more of that and kind of, you know, learning about what I do and I don't love in the genre.

693
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,920
And so, um, this is great.

694
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,880
And I'm really excited for this opportunity to be a panelist on this panel horror.

695
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,600
Why does it get no respect?

696
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,760
And, uh, we'll, we'll talk a little bit about that.

697
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,400
Uh, cause you know, I have some unique insight on that.

698
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,280
So, um, and uh, yeah, it was Tony Collette robbed of an Oscar for, um, hereditary.

699
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,640
Yes, of course she was.

700
00:40:51,640 --> 00:41:06,080
But you know, that's because people don't hold a horror up in the same, uh, calibers, a lot of other movies often, but anyway, uh, also on Saturday surviving the evolution of podcasting to video over on the digital media track.

701
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,080
This is a topic that, you know, we've been talking about for a little while.

702
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,680
Um, so I'm excited to participate in this discussion again.

703
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,520
Obviously I have some things to say about it.

704
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:24,480
Sunday at one o'clock, I'm moderating a discussion with some, um, uh, folks in the industry on ask the experts microtransactions in gaming.

705
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,680
So it's one of those microtransactions are here to stay.

706
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,200
What's the good, the bad, and the ugly of all that stuff.

707
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,600
So we'll get into that.

708
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,960
And then Monday at 1130 AM, this one's a ballroom panel.

709
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,800
This is a pretty big deal.

710
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,200
The voice actors from Red Dead Redemption one and two, we have four voice actors from the games that are going to be there.

711
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,640
And we're doing a ballroom panel on Monday.

712
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,200
Here's the interesting thing though.

713
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,080
They're actually running this panel Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.

714
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:57,840
It's, it's basically the big stars for Dragon cons video game track this year, as far as I know, I don't know, but they're running that panel.

715
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,520
So I'm, I'm a little bit like, okay, by Monday, I think they're going to have been asked a lot of questions, so we'll, we'll see.

716
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,000
It's going to be an interesting, and Monday is like 1130.

717
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,840
That's the time everyone's checking out of the hotel.

718
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,120
So it's going to be interesting to see who shows up and what they have to ask.

719
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:21,320
I probably a lot of locals don't have to worry about the hotel checkout game, but I'm very excited for the opportunity and to meet the people.

720
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,840
That'll be a lot of fun.

721
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,480
So yeah, three tracks this year.

722
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,560
I'm really excited about it.

723
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,360
And I'll look forward to seeing some of you Dragon Con Labor Day weekend.

724
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,120
I've been getting a question online a lot.

725
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,520
Will the panels be streamed?

726
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,520
The only one that I know of that is streamed is that, um, how do you do fellow kids, uh, thriving over 40?

727
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,360
Uh, that panel will be on Dragon cons, uh, digital media, um, Twitch that's DC digital media.

728
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:56,520
If you want to follow that, the other panels, unfortunately, I don't know if they're straddle think they are, they may be recorded for future use, but I don't want to guarantee anything.

729
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,440
I, one of them may be on Dragon con TV subscription service, but I don't want to guarantee that either.

730
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:12,720
Um, so honestly, I think Dragon con would just prefer if you really want to see the panels that bad come out, but, uh, to be fair, there's a lot of hesitations still around COVID understandably.

731
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,360
So they have tried to up their virtual offerings.

732
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,880
I will say a lot more is online than you would have found a couple of years ago.

733
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,640
So there is that.

734
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:20,680
Okay.

735
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,000
Uh, SG100 Matt says, I'm excited for both Rob and Bobby.

736
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,280
You're on some fun panels.

737
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,680
Yeah.

738
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,040
Um, uh, we're excited.

739
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,120
We've be very, uh, very, very fun.

740
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,280
Um, all right, let's get into some more gaming news for the week.

741
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,720
I'm going to kick it over to Loki to start us off with some other gaming news.

742
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:53,840
Uh, yeah, so, um, unfortunately we have more news to kind of tie into the story we talked about last week about allegations of sexual harassment at Nintendo of America.

743
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,480
And this is coming now from, um, the testing side of that.

744
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:12,280
So the game testers who are, you know, a lot of times contracted for Nintendo and stuff, um, have recounted lots of different scenarios where they've been sexually harassed.

745
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,240
So they talked about, there was an article on Kotaku that kind of went into detail about it.

746
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:28,000
Um, talking about like one of the testers who they're calling Hannah, who had, um, experiences that led her to quit her job.

747
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:47,400
Um, basically saying it was supposed to be a lighthearted place, but then ended up that, um, there was a male translator that they were working with that started posting, um, you know, uh, memes and stuff about why, like, what's the best Pokemon to have sex with.

748
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,560
And started making kind of like an, I mean, that's not, that's not necessarily work discussion.

749
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,960
I would think most of the time.

750
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,320
Uh, yeah, it's, uh, probably, yeah, just because it involves Pokemon does not make it appropriate for work.

751
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:00,320
Yeah.

752
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,120
And it started escalating from there.

753
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,240
Um, you know, she said that it's, Nintendo was almost like a nightmare.

754
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,960
It is sad because I love Nintendo.

755
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,640
I grew up in Nintendo.

756
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,400
I was so excited to join Nintendo when I first got there and thought it was, I was going to go somewhere.

757
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,920
Um, I had my supervisors tell me I was doing such a great job.

758
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:29,640
Um, but then of course, you know, there's been other, um, recounts of different things, you know, the common saying that they've really felt like a frat house sometimes.

759
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:38,720
So kind of the whole just misogyny and just uncomfortable, you know, sexual comments and, you know,

760
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,080
type tiger claw and chat says water cooler type of discussions.

761
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,600
No, no, no.

762
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,720
Inappropriate ones.

763
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,880
A water cooler discussion would be, Hey, did you see who got kicked off the mass singer last night?

764
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,480
That is an appropriate work, uh, discussion water cooler discussion.

765
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,640
Uh, yeah.

766
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,960
Would you rather fuck Pikachu or Jigglypuff?

767
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,640
That's not an appropriate water cooler discussion, whether it was at the water cooler or not.

768
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,360
Yeah.

769
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:14,400
Then outside of the sexual comments, there was also, you know, the, your typical, um, you know, discrimination based on gender for like promotions and whatnot.

770
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,280
So for example, one of the female contractors, uh, was trying to advance to the company.

771
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:26,400
I applied for a bunch of other jobs in the industry and they would ask me why I was looking to leave Nintendo.

772
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,280
I, I'm sorry, I know you're saying it the way it is.

773
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,320
I know you are, but it's just one of those things.

774
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,120
It was like, how disgusting is it that we have, this is just the typical discrimination you see in the industry.

775
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:44,120
This is just the, here's our, you know, our, our, uh, uh, assembly line discrimination we have going on, uh, behind the scenes at the different companies.

776
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,360
Like I just, I, I hate that we're here, but we're here.

777
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:48,920
We've been here.

778
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,680
We've been here.

779
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,800
It sounds so familiar.

780
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,680
It's like we talked about this dozens of times, just insert every company in here.

781
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:05,480
There was one, uh, another tester, uh, Valerie Allison that, uh, said she would ask her managers how she would be promoted to a permanent position.

782
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:17,720
And, um, basically that she felt pressure to become a full-time play because she needed to stay at Lincoln and says, uh, your chance to be converted to full-time was probably worse as a girl.

783
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:24,600
She said, um, it's usually the guys who get promoted and they're all usually friends.

784
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,040
They all watch super bowl together.

785
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,320
As she went on to Matt and chat says, these are not isolated issues.

786
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,960
This is an epidemic within the industry, a hundred percent.

787
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,200
I wouldn't even say it's necessarily just this industry, even it's just true.

788
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,880
This is just corporate.

789
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,720
Um, but this is it.

790
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,400
You notice what's happened here.

791
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
We had one Nintendo story.

792
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:52,040
Then we had a second Nintendo story and now the dam is starting to burst because now what you've just named three different women, at least so far in this.

793
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,320
So now people are starting to realize, oh, it wasn't just me.

794
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,000
This was an epidemic.

795
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,720
I mean, it keeps saying that they're taking, going to take this seriously.

796
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,120
All right.

797
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:00,520
We'll see.

798
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,600
Let's see what you do.

799
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,880
Now, Nintendo has to acknowledge it because they have very clearly been trying to hide from it when it was one or two.

800
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,920
And this is, this is now the first time where I believe Doug Bowser finally had to comment on it this week.

801
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:20,520
Like somebody finally called him out on it, um, and asked him like, what the hell's the plan to, you know, stop this culture?

802
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,760
Um, which I felt was a very non-answer answer.

803
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:32,120
Um, let's, let's see, you know, but here's the thing at the end of the day, I'm not interested in his words.

804
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,000
I'm not, I'm interested in the actions.

805
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,880
So if Doug Bowser really wants to say something, say it with action.

806
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,760
I could care less what his comment was on this.

807
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,460
Yeah.

808
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,880
Anyway, yeah.

809
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:56,680
Basically, it's a, it's a very long article with lots of different examples of this, but like, honestly, like all of these examples, I could read every single one.

810
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:06,840
It's all stuff we've heard before, you know, where it's like, you know, if, if a female come, like tries to stand up for herself, they're just gonna be called overly sensitive.

811
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:15,960
If, you know, they try to advance in the company, they'll find excuses for why they can't without saying gender, you know, because obviously that's discriminatory.

812
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,560
But they'll, they'll make excuses.

813
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,640
Or I'm sure that compensation is probably more for the males than the females.

814
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,600
It's, we've heard this so many times.

815
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,480
And I wouldn't be surprised if it's not in every single company, at least large companies for sure.

816
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,120
I mean, some of these smaller, like indie studios and stuff.

817
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,440
I'm sure there's probably some, but like some of these, they're very small.

818
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:50,280
I can't imagine that there's, you know, they're really small teams, but like definitely in these larger companies, it's easier to lose sight on kind of the details when you're working with hundreds of employees.

819
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:59,720
And it's easy to have these folks in management just kind of off the rails without realizing it.

820
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:08,040
All right, I'm going to move on and talk about a part of the industry that is growing and growing and growing.

821
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,960
And that is the Embracer Group, who is starting to acquire quite a few holdings under their belt.

822
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:19,880
You may recall they bought that part of Square Enix that Square Enix was desperate to get rid of.

823
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,040
Like, oh, Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider is so bad.

824
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,800
We have to get rid of it right now.

825
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,360
Like, which I obviously I'm saying that very tongue in cheek because the Tomb Raider only wears one belt.

826
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,480
This is ridiculous.

827
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,920
Doesn't fit with our portfolio.

828
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,320
Anyway, so Embracer is on a spree right now.

829
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,560
One of the biggest things has been turning heads.

830
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:51,480
They now own JRR, the rights basically to, well, they actually they bought Middle Earth Enterprises.

831
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,360
That's the company that owns big screen and small screen rights to Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.

832
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,400
So this could this mean that a Hobbit game is on the horizon?

833
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,400
Probably going to be a long way out.

834
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,880
But, you know, but that's also the fact that they have the screen rights as well.

835
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,560
You know, this is what was used to make this 1978 animated film.

836
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,440
Peter Jackson's movies, Amazon's upcoming thing.

837
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:21,560
Oh, actually, Amazon's thing was a loophole because it excluded TV series of more than

838
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,560
eight or eight episodes or something like that.

839
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,440
There was some weird exclusion that they're kind of dancing around the rights with that.

840
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,400
But anyway, so that's not all of it, though.

841
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,680
Embracer also went and they bought more stuff as well.

842
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,360
They also got limited run games.

843
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:43,640
That's huge because they're doing a lot of those physical copy things of games and so forth.

844
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,480
That was brought up this week as well.

845
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:52,200
Tripwire Interactive, who made the games Killing 4 and Chivalry was that as well.

846
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,200
Tuxedo Labs, who made Tear Down was a part of that as well.

847
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:01,160
So, Embracer has been going through and buying all of these companies.

848
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,560
Another one that they got as part of this, Tatsujin, the Japanese studio.

849
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:13,480
The boss of Tatsujin is a co-founder of Tappelan, Mashihiro Yuge.

850
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,640
That's the developers of Zero Wing.

851
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:24,600
So, Toaplan has done a great many of awesome game, including, I want to say they did

852
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,400
Truxton, didn't they?

853
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,280
Yeah, Truxton.

854
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,440
Because here's an interesting kind of the same week this story comes out.

855
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,080
Fire and Fire Shark.

856
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,720
Classic games from this publisher are coming out to the PC.

857
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:48,600
Truxton, Twin Cobra, Out Zone, and Zero Wing, published and enhanced by Bitwave Games.

858
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,760
I'm not sure these games were in high demand, but cool.

859
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,720
People can now revisit one of the internet's first memes.

860
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,880
Because, of course, I think most people know at this point that All Your Base Belong to

861
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,400
Us, Move Every Zig, that's all from Zero Wing.

862
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,040
And I imagine they're going to leave all that translation intact.

863
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,480
But they are saying it's pixel perfect graphics.

864
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,240
There's going to be a very easy mode.

865
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,320
So, they're actually patching in a Bobby Black Wolf mode.

866
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,840
That's very exciting.

867
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,720
But yeah, all these games are coming to PC in 2022.

868
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,180
Fun.

869
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:27,580
Bobby Black Wolf giving us some insight to the Tripwire acquisition and tying this together

870
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,940
to something else you all might have heard about.

871
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:34,620
This is interesting because they made a statement that says the co-founder that had previously

872
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:40,940
made the anti-abortion comments will be exploring opportunities outside of Tripwire.

873
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:45,340
This was the only way Tripwire could remove that founder was by being bought.

874
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,940
He stepped down as CEO, but still owned most of the company.

875
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,820
You may recall that story from a little while ago.

876
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:56,140
That was the same company where the CEO was making, you know, the anti-abortion statements

877
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,340
that the folks that worked there didn't agree with.

878
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,500
And, you know, so now how this has come full circle.

879
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,340
They finally got rid of them or are going to get rid of them through this purchase.

880
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,540
Interesting.

881
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,300
So, let's see.

882
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,620
DarkTucionChat says, I found the developer on one of the other discords I hang out in.

883
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,780
Actually, these are the arcade ports.

884
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,540
Oh, I didn't realize that.

885
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:25,020
So that all your bases will not be present because that was in the console port.

886
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,140
So these are arcade ports.

887
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:26,860
Oh, that's too bad.

888
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,820
You'd think you'd think they're going to have a mode where you can change the dialogue.

889
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:32,940
That would be very upsetting.

890
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,620
I'm sure that a game that exists on PC can be modded.

891
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,860
Yeah, if this week has taught us anything dialogue, quote unquote.

892
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,660
Yeah, that's true.

893
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:45,340
If this week has taught us anything, there will be a dialogue fix patch for this game.

894
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:45,900
Absolutely.

895
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,980
As shown on a Mat and Chat wonders, I'm kind of interested what they will do with limited

896
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,860
run games.

897
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,780
Seems like they're keeping everyone there intact.

898
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,940
I wonder if there will be a straight cash infusion.

899
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,060
Possibly this could be a good thing for them.

900
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:01,340
I've heard that limited run games can be kind of slow sometimes.

901
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,580
So maybe a little injection of cash to help them deliver on things a little faster could

902
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,060
be cool if we're assuming that they're not completely evil.

903
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,420
That's the big assumption with the corporation.

904
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:11,660
True.

905
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:18,940
Remember that they have a giant game archive now that they purchased as well.

906
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,620
Oh, yeah, that's true.

907
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,020
Yeah.

908
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:25,020
So perhaps some of that could play into this as well.

909
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,820
Interesting.

910
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:26,320
All right.

911
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:34,700
Well, we'll see what continues as Embracer is becoming quite the Voltron in the industry.

912
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:40,620
As I've heard Bobby refer to him on his show, the 10 cent of Europe is building strongly

913
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,020
over there.

914
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,460
All right.

915
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,620
In the meantime, let's move on to another story.

916
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,260
Dark Sakura.

917
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,660
So developers are not beyond being assholes.

918
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:56,780
In fact, we know a good many in the industry are assholes as we've just covered.

919
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:02,620
But it's not just the big names.

920
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,420
We have some from some of the indie developers as well.

921
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,820
So Dolphin Barn Incorporated.

922
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,140
They've already gotten into Hot Water.

923
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:21,740
They were talking, you know, they already put in some anti-mask rhetoric in one of their

924
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,660
patch notes for one of their games.

925
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:35,580
And basically, they have been sending abusive messages when they've banned players from

926
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,140
their hub.

927
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:46,060
And they were warned once saying that when posting any content in the community or communicating

928
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,340
with players, please make sure it adheres to the guidelines.

929
00:56:51,580 --> 00:57:00,460
But now they've been responding to negative reviews on Steam in a very abusive manner.

930
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:06,140
And so they also added, Steam did, we also want to make it clear that you should not

931
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:10,380
reverse the moderator decisions or enable rule violations on your hub.

932
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:15,340
Future disregard for our rules and guidelines could jeopardize our business relationship.

933
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:21,180
So they are banned from their own game community.

934
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:28,380
And this isn't the only time you like I said, they had the anti-mask rhetoric.

935
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:35,420
They also, May last year, they added a note about combat in a game that says, weak men

936
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,620
lack character.

937
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,380
It's really disgusting.

938
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:47,500
So yeah, they're banned from their own game.

939
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,700
You kind of have to love the punchline there, though.

940
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:56,140
Like you're so you're such an asshole, you got banned from a store that sells your game.

941
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,620
You got banned from a store that sells your game.

942
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,700
It's wild.

943
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:07,100
Yeah, they honestly, they shouldn't, I think, be allowed to post to Steam anymore.

944
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,140
Yeah, because I mean, honestly, they're still making money off this game.

945
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,260
So whatever.

946
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:18,140
I don't usually support piracy, but all right.

947
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,100
Anyway, don't even don't even support their game through piracy.

948
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,380
Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.

949
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,100
Just their game shouldn't be touched.

950
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,900
Even acknowledging it here is dirty.

951
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,100
But you still have to like, this doesn't happen every day.

952
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:33,980
We're developers.

953
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:37,660
So yeah, you just have it every day where a developer is so toxic, they get banned from

954
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,460
their own forum.

955
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,900
It does make for a great headline.

956
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,420
All right.

957
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,180
Fifth Dream in chat says, why are these men so interested in whether other men live up

958
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,860
to their man standards?

959
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:50,780
Great question, because these are the same men, as I was saying earlier, that are like,

960
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,940
you could be gay, just don't hit on me.

961
00:58:55,020 --> 00:59:02,380
Math, puzzle figures floating around the screen right now, because I don't understand.

962
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,420
They should just have their fingers and tongues cut out or something.

963
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:15,180
Metaphorically, of course, because we would never advocate violence here on Twitch television.

964
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,220
I wouldn't ever.

965
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:22,380
Moving on, let's talk about something else that should be banned from Steam.

966
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,740
I think it actually already is.

967
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,980
But Loki, please give us some insight.

968
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,740
Hey, I don't think it's ever going to be on.

969
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,260
I don't even know if.

970
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,860
Oh, I guess it did make it on Steam.

971
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,500
But yeah, I thought these games are banned from Steam.

972
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,620
But what do I know?

973
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:41,740
Yeah, so anyways, a game called Untamed Isles, who was kind of like a Pokemon game.

974
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,380
But then but then, you know, what makes Pokemon better?

975
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,100
Let's throw some crypto stuff in there as well.

976
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,780
NFTs, you know, love that.

977
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:53,100
So it raised half a million dollars on Kickstarter.

978
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,940
And that was a year ago.

979
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:00,700
And now it can't even make its money back.

980
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,300
They had posted an update on the game's Steam page

981
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,380
saying that we had to pause development of Untamed Isles and put the project on hold.

982
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:14,700
There have been a myriad of factors that have caused the lead up to this very moment.

983
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,740
But what all comes down to is we're finally unable to

984
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:21,260
financially keep up with the demands that we set out to do.

985
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:26,060
Basically, the crypto market is crashed.

986
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:31,900
And so they we leaned into the crypto market and expanded rapidly off the back of the positive

987
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:32,380
interest.

988
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:37,100
And when the crash came, we ended up heavily exposed with too short of a runway.

989
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,340
So basically, they took all your money that that you invested in the game.

990
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,780
They put it in the crypto market thinking, hey, double or nothing, right?

991
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,420
Well, nothing.

992
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,740
They still need to be responsible for for paying back the money.

993
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,340
Well, these are due to our cash reserves being empty.

994
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,900
We're not in a position to refund our initial backers.

995
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:04,620
We're sorry, but hey, I mean, technically, Kickstarter is just supporting the company

996
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,060
and not getting a product.

997
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:11,020
So, you know, by unfortunately, this happens often on Kickstarter, which is why I stopped

998
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:14,300
contributing kickstarters and why we don't have guests on the show anymore promoting

999
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,100
kickstarters.

1000
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:20,380
It's just sorry, but it's there's just too many of these types of stories, not the crypto

1001
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,660
thing necessarily, but just kickstarters that aren't able to follow through on their promises

1002
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,780
where it's just like, I'm not interested in promoting that.

1003
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:31,100
So yeah, unfortunately, a few bad apples have ruined it for everyone.

1004
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,540
That's the reality.

1005
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:36,700
So yeah.

1006
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:44,060
Well, I can't I can't believe this concept just didn't catch on like wild.

1007
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,620
So all right, let me move on.

1008
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,100
I want to talk about this.

1009
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,700
We kind of knew this was coming.

1010
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,380
I think we even kind of addressed it on a previous episode, but I will just quickly

1011
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,940
say confirmed the arcade went up.

1012
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:01,180
NFL Blitz is coming back or seriously is coming out.

1013
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,860
So NFL Blitz is coming back because an arcade went up is coming out.

1014
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:09,180
So there are some issues that are going to be addressed in the game, though.

1015
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:13,980
So it's interesting to kind of hear about some of the things that the NFL and all the

1016
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:19,500
rights holders and various things, one of them to do to fix up the game, such as violent

1017
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:25,420
collisions that were gratuitous things after the play and that went unpenalized.

1018
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:29,420
So this is just the type of thing that has kind of aged bad in twenty five years.

1019
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,740
So they've had to kind of scale that back a little bit.

1020
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,460
You know, they wanted to still keep the spirit of the game, obviously.

1021
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:39,420
But it's kind of like I get it sounds like the timer to do those types of things has

1022
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,180
been pulled back significantly.

1023
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,300
So it's kind of interesting.

1024
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:46,540
And it sounds like they have a lot of the agreements to bring back old players in the

1025
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:47,820
game, but you might not see them all.

1026
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:55,740
But you will get 1997 NFL Blitz, NFL Blitz 99 and NFL Blitz 2000 Gold Edition.

1027
01:02:56,460 --> 01:03:00,700
And they actually had to go in and change some of the code to make it happen.

1028
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,020
So I think it'll be cool.

1029
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:12,140
I'm not like a super fan of this NFL Blitz series, but I know it's in the whole same

1030
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:17,740
thing as like NBA Jam and, you know, kind of comes from that same era.

1031
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,460
So, yeah.

1032
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:24,860
S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, yeah, CTE isn't a joke and destroying players doesn't age

1033
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:25,180
well.

1034
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:25,740
Yeah.

1035
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:30,460
So in dark to see, it says a lot of people were passing on this because of the changes.

1036
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,140
Of course they are.

1037
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,140
Then more for the rest of us.

1038
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,620
Zen Monkey says, what's the point of bringing it back if they just have to make it like

1039
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,740
every other football game?

1040
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,060
Boo.

1041
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,780
Make the teams robots and do your own thing, Blitz.

1042
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,300
You don't need the NFL.

1043
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:51,740
Well, that is that is a I was going to say, you know, but the idea of making them robots

1044
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,780
or androids.

1045
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,580
Interesting.

1046
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:58,380
But I guess they wanted to err on the side of people would want to have at least some

1047
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:01,580
of the players and so forth and still in the game.

1048
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:05,340
And in order to make that happen, they wanted to do some of these changes.

1049
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:05,840
So.

1050
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:11,900
No, Bobby Blackwell points out Mutant Football League does exist exactly for that purpose

1051
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:12,380
pretty much.

1052
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,420
That's a good point.

1053
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:13,920
So.

1054
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:17,100
All right, let's move on to some more stories.

1055
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:17,740
Stark Sakura.

1056
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:23,820
So I know that a lot of people out there are big fans of Gran Turismo.

1057
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,660
I know my hubby is a big fan of Gran Turismo.

1058
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:38,220
And there is a car in Gran Turismo Sport that was designed by McLaren.

1059
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:45,820
If you don't know what me and McLaren is, they've made some of like the best supercars,

1060
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,580
you know, known to date.

1061
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,580
I've got to drive a McLaren once.

1062
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:50,140
It was great.

1063
01:04:50,140 --> 01:05:01,100
There was a car that they put in that was a virtual concept that was called the McLaren

1064
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,300
Solus GT.

1065
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:07,180
Well, McLaren now has manufactured the car.

1066
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:07,980
It is.

1067
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,100
It's a real thing now.

1068
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:15,820
It is a 5.2 liter V10 engine, seven speed sequential shift.

1069
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:20,300
It is pretty sleek.

1070
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:25,980
It kind of has that sort of almost detached front two wheels look.

1071
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,940
It's a fairly light car.

1072
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:39,260
It's all full carbon fiber body and titanium.

1073
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:44,860
And this thing would feel no pain around the track.

1074
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:51,020
It honestly, it's just so freaking pretty.

1075
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,580
It looks like the supercar.

1076
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,060
I won't lie.

1077
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:02,460
Anyone have a, you know, a couple of mails?

1078
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:06,540
A house in San Francisco to sell to help you afford that.

1079
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:12,780
No, it has a top speed of 322 kilometers an hour or 200 miles an hour.

1080
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:27,340
And it has 650 Nm of torque and 1200 downforce at 150 miles an hour.

1081
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,820
It's pretty intense.

1082
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:36,620
This would be the thing that I would have watched on Top Gear.

1083
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:37,100
I'll be perfectly honest.

1084
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,420
The question is which paint job do you like the best?

1085
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:40,460
Oh.

1086
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,300
I think the orange and blue looks great.

1087
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,420
The white and green makes me think of Jazz from Transformers.

1088
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:50,380
Also a little black and orange is good.

1089
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,620
Squiggly is not following.

1090
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:53,820
I'm not feeling the squigglies.

1091
01:06:55,820 --> 01:07:02,780
I really like the black with the, yeah.

1092
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,740
Is it orange or red?

1093
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:05,020
It looked like it was red to me.

1094
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,300
But it's also got a rainbow on it.

1095
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:08,940
That's awesome.

1096
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:15,020
But there's also this one that's like, uh, all black with gold detail on the tires.

1097
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,540
And I think that that's pretty sharp.

1098
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:22,860
That would be, that would be my jam without the numbers on it.

1099
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:28,540
Cause I mean, the numbers are more for racing anyway, but not that, that would just be

1100
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,140
pretty wicked, pretty wicked.

1101
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,540
I hit the button to feel the drive.

1102
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:36,780
Yeah.

1103
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:38,860
Number two is I think.

1104
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:41,340
I like the orange and blue with the little rainbow in the back.

1105
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,180
That's, that's a hot car.

1106
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:44,780
I really like that one for sure.

1107
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,660
But yeah, I'll never be able to afford it.

1108
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,820
So it's just something I can appreciate from a distance.

1109
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:56,460
I think that the whole thing is just a beautiful piece of machinery.

1110
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,620
I'm trying to figure out where the engine on it is.

1111
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,780
Is it a, is it, I think it's a rear engine.

1112
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,140
Oh, I'm sure.

1113
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:10,620
Um, there was one that had a central engine and I don't remember whether it wasn't a McLaren,

1114
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,780
but that thing was pretty interesting.

1115
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,140
I'll quickly say something else to show.

1116
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:17,580
And under Matt said in chat here saying coincidentally, the car costs as much in real

1117
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:22,780
life as it costs in in-game currency and GT and a lifetime of saving and playing to afford.

1118
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:23,020
Yes.

1119
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:24,300
Yeah.

1120
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:29,900
Um, I'm trying though to see, um,

1121
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,420
I'm trying to, I guess it's a rear engine.

1122
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:37,820
Um, uh, let's see, barrel throttle.

1123
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:47,980
Oh, at any rate, at any rate, um, uh, it also apparently has like, uh, uh, oh, uh, the engine

1124
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:50,620
is fixed, uh, to the chassis.

1125
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:51,820
There we go.

1126
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:53,020
Very interesting.

1127
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:53,500
Yeah.

1128
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:58,460
Um, this would definitely be on my list of dream cars, although I don't know if it's

1129
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:03,020
on my list of dream cars, although I would still give somebody else's right arm for one

1130
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,220
of the Bugatti Veyron's.

1131
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:07,660
I love the way you phrase that.

1132
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,660
I'd give somebody else's right arm, not mine.

1133
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,300
Cause somebody else's.

1134
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,740
In a heartbeat.

1135
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,380
Here have, have this person's right arm.

1136
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:15,980
Here's a doll's right arm.

1137
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:16,700
All right.

1138
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,220
Uh, let's move on.

1139
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,980
We're going to get to our next story.

1140
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:24,620
Uh, Loki, this is fascinating to me because we're talking about a fandom for a game that's

1141
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,420
not real.

1142
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:26,780
Help, help explain this here, please.

1143
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:27,580
It's like a meme.

1144
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:34,060
So it kind of reminds me a little bit of the free folk, um, which is the kind of the fan

1145
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:39,660
community for a game of Thrones who turned on game of Thrones when season eight sucked.

1146
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:47,820
Um, so it's kinda like that, but in a sense, uh, so what this is, it's about this game

1147
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:52,380
called Arkham world, uh, which is not a real game, obviously.

1148
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:57,260
Cause the next, uh, game that they're doing is, I don't remember what it's called now,

1149
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:01,260
but it's like with Robin and stuff and, um, it doesn't matter.

1150
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,940
Uh, Oh, I'm sorry.

1151
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,140
They're doing suicide squad.

1152
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,420
Oh, there was also Gotham nights.

1153
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,020
That was the one of the nights.

1154
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:07,820
It's this pod culture.

1155
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:08,620
Yeah.

1156
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:09,420
Gotham nights.

1157
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:14,300
So Gotham nights, eh, it's kinda like, you know, not, not all that exciting.

1158
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:19,100
So instead what the community is doing is they're talking about this like fictional

1159
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,740
game as if it's real and it's already out.

1160
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:25,660
Which is funny because like they keep posting all these like kind of memes or fake things

1161
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:29,580
like talking about, like, you know, for those who haven't been, you know, keeping up with

1162
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:35,260
like one year ago today, Batman Arkham world was released, you know, um, you know, what's,

1163
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,540
what's your opinion about this game?

1164
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,980
Or like they talked about, like, they keep like referencing stuff that happened in this

1165
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:40,460
game.

1166
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,060
Um, that's not real.

1167
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:46,060
Like they'll have screenshots where, Hey, look, my favorite part of this game is Spider-Man

1168
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,260
swinging in stuff like that.

1169
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:53,900
It's kind of funny, like, um, a way to just talk about, you know, what they actually want

1170
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:58,380
in the game, like a open world Arkham game versus what they're getting.

1171
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:02,060
So has anyone streamed the game on Twitch yet?

1172
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:02,860
That's what I want to see.

1173
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,820
No, I don't think it's streaming.

1174
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:08,060
Then somebody needs to take it to the next level.

1175
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:12,860
Like we just had that story, excuse me, two weeks ago of the people that made that entirely

1176
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:17,260
fake near level, like into the church and everything you need to, you Arkham world fans

1177
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,700
need to get on that level.

1178
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:22,220
You need to, if you really want to gaslight everyone into thinking your game is real,

1179
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,420
you need to get on that level.

1180
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:29,020
Well, the thing too about it is like, it's kind of funny, like, I mean, it's sort of

1181
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:36,060
like civil disobedience as well, because you're like, instead of talking about, I mean, obviously

1182
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:42,780
if the subreddit's not owned by the folks developing these Arkham games, um, but typically

1183
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:47,100
like a studio would probably want to promote their game within that community.

1184
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:51,900
And so kind of like, well, we, we don't really, we're not interested in your stupid Gotham

1185
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,140
night.

1186
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:57,260
So we're going to just talk about this other game and just talk about all this hypothetical

1187
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:58,220
stuff that's going on.

1188
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,260
It's kind of funny.

1189
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,380
It's not an original idea.

1190
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:04,220
Apparently, uh, one of the, the, uh, folks is sorry.

1191
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:09,420
Unhappy worker 77 said that it was something that happened in the Titanfall community with,

1192
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:12,620
uh, Titanfall three, where they pretend that's a real thing as well.

1193
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,020
Yeah.

1194
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:13,340
Yeah.

1195
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:15,420
Which I wish it was a real thing.

1196
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,180
Cause Titanfall two I hear is really good.

1197
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,860
Apex is still pretty good though.

1198
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:25,900
As far as those giant robot and giant giant mech robot is what makes everything better.

1199
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:26,540
Everything better.

1200
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:27,980
All right.

1201
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,420
Well, retro goodness always makes things better too.

1202
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:36,940
And of course, a lot of people are very excited about the mini Genesis two, uh, the full list

1203
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,300
of games came out.

1204
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:44,140
So we know exactly what is going to be, uh, in the Japanese version and the U S version

1205
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:47,820
of the Sega, uh, Genesis or mega drive mini two.

1206
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:51,580
The only way you can get one of these in North America, by the way, is to get one from Amazon,

1207
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:57,740
Japan, which I think is interesting, but because there are so few of them being made because

1208
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:01,020
of, you know, components and parts and things like that, they basically only have the one

1209
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:01,660
way to get it.

1210
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:07,820
Now, this whole thing, and this announcement of the big game list kicked off quite the

1211
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,580
discussion in our discord this week.

1212
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:13,580
I was almost a little taken by surprise how like much people had to say about it, uh,

1213
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:18,620
in a pleasant way, uh, over on our discord, over at vog network.com slash discord.

1214
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:24,940
And I'm going to make a long story, very short, basically with the lists for both these, um,

1215
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:30,380
you know, the, the Japanese and the U S one coming out, it was noted, um, that there are

1216
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:34,940
some games missing from the U S one that are going to be in the Japanese ones, namely the

1217
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,700
lunar games is what it comes down to.

1218
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:39,820
So the lunar games that are going to be in the Japanese one will not be in the U S one.

1219
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:43,660
And, you know, that's ridiculous.

1220
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,980
And people are pointing the fingers all over the place.

1221
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:53,580
Um, there is a tweet that we were referenced here from mega drive shock, who kind of tries

1222
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:54,780
to summarize what's going on here.

1223
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:59,900
Victor Ireland sold the N a publishing and script rights to lunar back to game arts.

1224
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:03,100
The only thing Ireland still owns is the audio.

1225
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:07,740
The reason lunar won't be on the Genesis mini too is because Ireland wanted more money to

1226
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:13,660
license the audio and, uh, it sources this Twitter account sources, an operation rainfall

1227
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:18,460
interview where, um, in the interview of operation rainfall, he was asked, is there any chance

1228
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,260
of this occurring again with Gaijin works?

1229
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,820
Um, which I think was something else that was happening at the time.

1230
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,460
And, uh, Victor said, I'm not going to say no.

1231
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:31,820
I think it would be cool to do, but the thing is that with the way the rights are with lunar,

1232
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,740
we sold most of the rights back to game arts.

1233
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:37,100
So game arts has almost all the rights to lunar, except for the performance rights to

1234
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:37,900
the audio.

1235
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:42,060
So really they have most, uh, and if the lunar license was to happen, we would just be licensing

1236
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:42,620
that little piece.

1237
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:45,260
So it could come out and it would probably come out under their name.

1238
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,460
So they would do marketing for it.

1239
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:51,100
So I think it's unlikely, but I'm not going to say no, it would be cool to do here's here's

1240
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,100
my take, which I don't think I've seen yet.

1241
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,620
And I just kind of want to plant this.

1242
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,180
Why?

1243
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,140
Question mark seed.

1244
01:14:56,780 --> 01:15:00,460
If the audio is what's holding it back, why don't they replace it?

1245
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,580
What do you mean saying you can't replace it?

1246
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:06,460
We just talked about it with Sonic, the hedgehog three.

1247
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,220
Do you know how much more money they would have to pay?

1248
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:11,100
I know they just, they just did it with Sonic, the hedgehog.

1249
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,180
And that was, that was Michael Jackson music.

1250
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,300
Now, granted, that's a little different.

1251
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:18,540
Yeah.

1252
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:23,660
But I'm just like, I, if, if that is truly what's holding this back, I mean, but maybe

1253
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:28,700
because they can, and I will be only because they can make so many of them and these types

1254
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:33,660
of things, maybe it's just not worth it to have somebody go in there and redo things.

1255
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:36,860
Bobby Black Wolf says lunar is also the voice acting.

1256
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:42,380
Well, Konami tried to find a way around that too with the Silent Hill collection.

1257
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,260
Didn't go so well for him though, at the end of the day.

1258
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:49,100
So that can also be fixed, but fair.

1259
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:54,940
But yeah, it's probably, and as Orange Wright says, it's too much effort probably for the

1260
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:59,660
minimal amount of release that they're doing with these, you know, again, they're only

1261
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:03,740
going to sell what a 10th of what they had published last time, just due to the shortages

1262
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,380
and all that stuff.

1263
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:10,140
I would say, hold out hope, maybe that there'll be a third one of these and then maybe those

1264
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,860
games will show up if there's the demand for them.

1265
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,180
But it's interesting.

1266
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:20,460
So of course I, I kind of missed those Sega years personally.

1267
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:24,220
So to be honest, I've never played lunar, but I've heard a lot of great things about

1268
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,700
it and I feel like, Oh, clearly I'm missing something there.

1269
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,100
So, all right.

1270
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,580
Anyway, let's move on.

1271
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:39,100
Let's move on to, let's move on to a simpler time and a retro title that has had no problems

1272
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,700
getting reported and republished over and over again.

1273
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,540
We're going to go to the classic game of the week.

1274
01:16:44,540 --> 01:17:00,540
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1275
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,780
out a classic and tell you about it.

1276
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,420
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1277
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:07,100
All right.

1278
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:10,700
And dark soccer, what classic game did you pick for folks this week?

1279
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,460
I picked ice climber.

1280
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:21,820
Ice climber was a platformer that was developed and published by Nintendo first for the versus

1281
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:25,260
system, the arcade versus system in 1984.

1282
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:34,780
And then after that for the Famicom and NES in 1985, the characters were Popo and Nana.

1283
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,300
Although in the German version, they were Pepe and Nana.

1284
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,420
They were known as the ice climbers.

1285
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:49,420
And they had to go through 32 vertically scrolling mountains to recover stolen vegetables

1286
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:50,460
from a giant condor.

1287
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:56,380
And in some European countries, ice climber was bundled with the NES.

1288
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:04,540
The versus ice climber has a little animated title screen and the stage select menu at

1289
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,780
the start of the game in between levels.

1290
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:14,140
16 more mountains, occasional blizzards and wind effects, more enemy characters and bonus

1291
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,180
multiplayer items.

1292
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:22,940
And of course, as we know, Nana and Popo were playable in the Smash Brothers series, starting

1293
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,260
with Super Smash Brothers Melee on GameCube.

1294
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:31,020
And we'll get into other bits of this later.

1295
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:38,780
But player one is Popo, player two is Nana wearing a blue and pink parka respectively.

1296
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:47,260
They have a mallet to carve out cave openings in the ice above and to hit enemies.

1297
01:18:47,900 --> 01:19:00,940
And each of the different mountains have different enemies that will appear.

1298
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:04,460
And you have a bonus stage for each level.

1299
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:08,940
So each mountain is eight layers of ice and then the bonus stage.

1300
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:15,180
Some square blocks that have higher detail are indestructible, so you have to take a

1301
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:15,740
different path.

1302
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:22,940
There's also hatched ice that is sort of a sliding conveyor belt thing for Nana or Popo

1303
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:23,500
left or right.

1304
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:27,660
And then there's these clouds that you can't break.

1305
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:33,500
But anyway, you have to go up the mountain and defeat enemies and keep going.

1306
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:43,580
Now, as I said in the arcade version, there were some other differences.

1307
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:52,300
You have, once you go through the initial set of 24 mountains, you have another 24 to

1308
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,660
go through and then Condor is replaced by a giant butterfly.

1309
01:19:56,620 --> 01:20:01,660
And then after the next eight stages are cleared, you get bonus round and then you pick up the

1310
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:10,540
cycle all over again and it keeps a track whether it was claimed by, well, the mountain

1311
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:14,460
was claimed by an ice climber or if it's still topi territory.

1312
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:23,180
So they get trickier, they get harder, and then after each bonus stage, those scores

1313
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,740
are tallied and points are awarded for various things.

1314
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:33,340
And it does keep track of the high score, although you cannot save it on the NES version.

1315
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:47,020
As far as, you know, a few other things going on with this, there were different releases,

1316
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:49,660
but I want to go back a little bit into the development history.

1317
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:59,500
Ice Climber and NES Open Tournament Golf were directed by Miki Kenji, a long time Nintendo

1318
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,540
producer.

1319
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:06,940
It was also the first game programmed by Morita Kazuaki, and it was, as he says, his warm

1320
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,980
up before becoming the main programmer on Super Mario Brothers.

1321
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:20,700
And he also was credited with central programming for other games in the Super Mario Brothers

1322
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,420
series, Legend of Zelda series, and Star Fox 64.

1323
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:30,140
So Ice Climber was a launch title for the NES in North America and then was re-released

1324
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,180
with some of the consoles.

1325
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:39,980
The PC-8801 version had a more limited color palette and a reworked HUD, versus Ice Climber

1326
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:48,220
has been re-released for Famicom Disk, removing the difficulty settings, and then having graphics

1327
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:49,900
closer to Ice Climber.

1328
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:57,500
It also was released in Arcade Archives for Nintendo Switch, although they removed the

1329
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,700
B enemy.

1330
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:09,260
The NES game is unlockable in Animal Crossing for GameCube, and it can only be officially

1331
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:11,740
unlocked via e-reader in North America.

1332
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:24,620
And then it was also a gift for players that requested their save data be transferred from

1333
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:32,060
the Japanese Dobutsu Nomori to the Dobutsu Nomori Plus Edition.

1334
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:38,540
So as far as various systems it has been on, we'll go ahead and start.

1335
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:48,460
We have the Arcade Versus, Famicom NES, the NEC PC-8801 published by Hudson Soft, the

1336
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:56,460
Famicom Disk System port, the e-reader version, Game Boy Advance, Wii Virtual Console, 3DS

1337
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:01,820
Virtual Console, Wii U Virtual Console, Nintendo Switch Online, and Nintendo Switch Arcade

1338
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:02,380
Archives.

1339
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:12,940
As of April 1st, 1985, it was the eighth most successful table arcade unit according to

1340
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:13,980
Japan Machine.

1341
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:26,940
And the former president of Finland, Mano Koivisto, was a big fan of Nintendo games,

1342
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:29,500
and his son-in-law said that Ice Climber was his favorite.

1343
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:37,980
Computer Entertainer said that the American release was addictive for fans of climbing

1344
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:38,380
games.

1345
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:49,340
As far as its legacy is considered, they are playable characters in the NES, the 2.5D version

1346
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:56,540
of the NES Summit level throughout Super Smash Brothers, and they are voiced by Kobayashi

1347
01:23:56,540 --> 01:24:10,300
Sanai, and then they were removed for 3DS and Wii U because of the difficulty in maintaining

1348
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,820
parity between the two characters.

1349
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:20,060
And then they had themes from Ice Climber appear regularly in the WarioWare series,

1350
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:24,220
and Kirby Nightmare in Dream Land and Kirby Air Ride.

1351
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:31,020
Kirby gets a freeze ability, and he wears Popo's parka the same way as in Super Smash

1352
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:31,420
Brothers.

1353
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:42,540
There's Ice Climber in Tetris DS, and then Daigasso Band of Brothers includes the bonus

1354
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:49,420
stage music theme, and Ice Climbers appear in Super Mario Maker as unlockable Mystery

1355
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,780
Mushroom costumes.

1356
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:58,700
I love that.

1357
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:03,900
Ice Climbers is such a gem, and you know, once again, chat kind of calling out, here

1358
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,540
we are episode 927 and never done this game.

1359
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:09,980
That's the great thing about this segment is that, you know, there's just so many games

1360
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:13,980
out there, and we've played a lot more games than we think.

1361
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:19,260
You know, it's pretty wild that, you know, yeah, we've done this segment since episode

1362
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,140
250.

1363
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:24,140
So give or take 700, 650, 700 unique games.

1364
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:29,100
I think maybe there's been an accidental repetition like twice, or maybe when you did

1365
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,780
like soundtracks, you kind of repeated some games because you were focusing on the soundtracks,

1366
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:35,580
but like honestly, 650 unique games.

1367
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:37,580
That's a lot of games.

1368
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:39,580
You know, people have played a lot of games over the years.

1369
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:42,780
But anyway, Ice Climbers is certainly one that I remember fondly.

1370
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,460
There are a lot of games in the world.

1371
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,100
Yes, there are.

1372
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:45,340
Yes, there are.

1373
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,220
People have played them.

1374
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:47,980
There are.

1375
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:48,380
There are.

1376
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:53,900
And there's more made every single day, especially thanks to indies and the whole scene.

1377
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:56,060
So we'll never run out of games for this segment.

1378
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:57,180
All right.

1379
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:58,860
There it is.

1380
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,700
Ice Climbers, a real classic.

1381
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:05,580
And yeah, it's just somebody had referenced in chat how, you know, Ice Climbers kind of

1382
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:11,500
comes from that era of like that NES launch cartridge era where all those games kind of

1383
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:15,260
ran on a very similar engine and had this kind of a similar look and feel to them.

1384
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:17,100
That very, that same font.

1385
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:21,020
I think that Nintendo system font that really, you know, kind of ties a lot of those early

1386
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:21,740
games together.

1387
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:28,460
Just all the menus and everything were kind of similar to very much like arcade ports,

1388
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:31,980
probably because they were based off the versus versus.

1389
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:37,420
So anyway, but Ice Climbers definitely like for me, like just a gold, even if, yes, it's

1390
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:38,700
hard as hell.

1391
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:43,660
It's the jumping is impossible to control, but that's what the game is.

1392
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:45,580
Who puts conveyor belts on a mountain?

1393
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:48,460
I don't know, but that's, you know, that's part of the game's charm.

1394
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:51,820
It was so difficult that when you actually got to the top of the mountain, you really

1395
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:53,020
did accomplish something.

1396
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:54,380
It's like that game's not easy.

1397
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:55,420
So all right.

1398
01:26:55,420 --> 01:27:01,180
Anyway, let's move on and talk about some other news happening in the gaming world quickly

1399
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:02,860
here in rapid fire news.

1400
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:03,360
Loki.

1401
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:09,660
All right, so Sony is going to be, well, a couple of things.

1402
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:12,460
First, Death Stranding is coming to Games Pass.

1403
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:16,700
So originally that was something that was available on PlayStation.

1404
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:22,460
Well, of course, now on PC Game Pass, since it is out in PC, it is going to be available.

1405
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:29,740
And so we got a little tweet from Xbox Game Pass PC that shows, you know, special delivery.

1406
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:34,380
And yeah, I'm excited to play this on my new PC.

1407
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,300
I really is.

1408
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:39,260
Is it the special edition or is it just the regular one?

1409
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,340
I don't know.

1410
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,460
Or it's a special edition.

1411
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,140
Whatever the PC one was.

1412
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,380
Oh, which I don't know if they ever released.

1413
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:51,580
Yeah, it says despite five or five, also releasing a PC version of the director's cut.

1414
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:59,500
The original game is it says the on the Games Pass stuff.

1415
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:04,380
It says describes it as the original version of Hideo Kojima is critically claimed and

1416
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,820
genre defined epic.

1417
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:09,580
That's hard to say if it's going to be the director's cut or not, but.

1418
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:14,460
I'm just going to assume it's not at this point, but oh, well, I'll still check it out

1419
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:17,500
because it'll probably look even better than it did when I played it on PlayStation the

1420
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,000
first time.

1421
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:19,100
Yeah, probably.

1422
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:24,700
And then Sony is also going to be developing a Days Gone movie, apparently.

1423
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:35,500
So according to Deadline, Sam Hagen is circling the project and screenwriter Sheldon Turner

1424
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,300
is adapting.

1425
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:41,740
So we'll have to see what that's like, I guess.

1426
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:42,860
Other zombie movie.

1427
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:47,100
No shortage of video game related media lately, right?

1428
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,660
I keep seeing that Uncharted finally hit Netflix.

1429
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:51,980
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1430
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:54,700
I haven't got a chance to watch it or if I'm going to.

1431
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:56,300
Dark Sakura.

1432
01:28:57,820 --> 01:29:02,860
So in other news going on, I saw this and I was like, oh, that looks good.

1433
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:11,420
Some fans are remaking the first Resident Evil in Unreal Engine 5, and it looks really,

1434
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:12,460
really, really good.

1435
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:19,180
They're calling it Biohazard RE1 Classic Edition.

1436
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:24,380
And it honestly is looking really good.

1437
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:27,020
They're hoping to have that out.

1438
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,420
I'm trying to see when they said.

1439
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:38,460
No, I don't have I don't see a date on it, but they seem to like quite a lot for Jill

1440
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:43,660
Dunn, like their little trailer has her doing the Moonlight Sonata scene to open the door

1441
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:48,540
and her working with Barry and some of her voice lines recorded.

1442
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:51,020
So it looks really good.

1443
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:52,140
Awesome.

1444
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:55,900
And they're also working on doing a non fixed dangle version.

1445
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:58,060
Oh, yeah.

1446
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:04,460
All right, quickly, in another part of the gaming universe, QuakeCon 2022 happened this

1447
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:05,500
last weekend.

1448
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,820
It was virtual again this year, so it was mostly streaming announcements and things

1449
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:10,380
of that sort.

1450
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:16,540
However, obviously, with Microsoft having picked up Bethesda some time ago, these QuakeCons

1451
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:18,140
end up being a lot of Bethesda announcements.

1452
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:21,500
And lately it's about how they're partnering with Microsoft.

1453
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,780
And again, a lot of Xbox Game Pass releases.

1454
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:29,340
Six Bethesda games for Xbox Game Pass PC.

1455
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:33,340
Please note this is PC and is not a Series X or anything.

1456
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:39,420
But Wolfenstein 3D as in the classic, which I think Jamie, didn't we have that as a classic

1457
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,660
game, like not even like three months ago or something?

1458
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:42,220
It was recent.

1459
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,100
Yeah, we did.

1460
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:49,660
Yeah, so that is now on Game Pass PC, as is the return to Castle Wolfenstein, the reboot

1461
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:50,860
they did years later.

1462
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:56,060
Quake 4, Quake Champions, that game, I think it was already free to play, but it's like

1463
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,820
you get all the champions unlocked in that.

1464
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:02,780
And then for some reason, even though it's QuakeCon, we got some Elder Scrolls announcements.

1465
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:06,620
Battlespire and Redguard are also now on Xbox Game Pass PCs.

1466
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:10,940
So it's like some more classic titles, mostly, besides the Quake Champions.

1467
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:13,500
Pretty cool that that's all available.

1468
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:18,700
I also noticed Doom 64 was on Epic Game Stores, the freebie.

1469
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:22,940
So this is not just limited to Xbox Game Pass stuff.

1470
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:26,300
There's some other stuff going on around the gaming universe as well.

1471
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:32,380
So if no one special 77 is out there somewhere, enjoy all those free games, including Doom

1472
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,220
64, which is not bad.

1473
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:35,980
It's worth checking out for sure.

1474
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:40,540
So all right, let's move on with some more stories.

1475
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:43,500
Oh, actually, no, we're going to go to some release dates first and check out the games

1476
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,580
that are coming out this week.

1477
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:49,340
Loki, I don't think I need to ask about the big one in the US this week because you already

1478
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:50,540
said you were going to stream it.

1479
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:53,740
But humor us and recap the releases anyway.

1480
01:31:54,380 --> 01:32:00,860
The big one this week is Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation

1481
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:03,740
4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

1482
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:08,540
Is it still that comic that that told all the Rednet jokes that host that?

1483
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:09,740
Or did they have to have a...

1484
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:11,980
Yes, I literally forgot his name.

1485
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:13,980
Was just Jeff Foxworthy.

1486
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:15,740
But you know who's hosting it now?

1487
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,540
No, that's always cool.

1488
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:17,260
Who hosts it now?

1489
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:20,540
Well, nobody, because you can't see him.

1490
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,380
But it's John Cena.

1491
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:23,900
Is it really?

1492
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,260
Yeah.

1493
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:26,460
Oh, I didn't know that.

1494
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:27,100
I don't know.

1495
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,300
I literally don't know.

1496
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,020
Or I'm sorry.

1497
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:29,420
Yeah.

1498
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:32,540
So well, actually, it was revived with John Cena.

1499
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:37,340
So he hosted from June 10th through November 2019.

1500
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:39,500
I'm not surprised at all that John Cena is hosting a game show.

1501
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,060
Of course he is.

1502
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:44,220
If it's still is it still even on TV?

1503
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:49,420
Like I saw like I was like we went to the theaters for something and they had, you know,

1504
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,980
those advertisements before the show type thing.

1505
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:53,500
And I think they were showing that.

1506
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,340
And I saw John Cena, you know, seemed like what?

1507
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,660
Yeah, I don't know if it's it's back on again.

1508
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:03,260
And honestly, I'm going to be is terrible game show.

1509
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:04,700
Like I love game shows.

1510
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:07,100
I think that game show is really one of the worst.

1511
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,740
It's a one trick pony show.

1512
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:12,220
And like the gag is old after five minutes.

1513
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:15,100
I think it's really one of the worst game shows they've ever made.

1514
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:17,180
I think I don't know why he's watching it.

1515
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:18,620
Why do you bring it back?

1516
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:20,860
But it's it's called something else.

1517
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:24,220
And it's not like are you smarter than are you a dumb shit?

1518
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:25,420
It's like something.

1519
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:27,580
Actually, I don't want to use that word because it's ableist.

1520
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:30,540
But like, like, are you?

1521
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:34,060
But but that's that's the whole that's the whole gag of the show.

1522
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:35,260
I just I just don't care for the show.

1523
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:37,420
But anyway, there's other games coming out, right, Loki?

1524
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:38,940
Yeah.

1525
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:39,260
Yeah.

1526
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:46,140
So aside from that, there's going to be Fallen Legion Revenants, which is on PC, PlayStation

1527
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:50,060
five, Xbox one, Xbox series, Fallen Legion, Rise of Glory.

1528
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:53,020
That is also going to be on the same platforms as well.

1529
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:59,420
Midnight Fight Express on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1530
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:05,100
Saints Row is going to be out on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one.

1531
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:06,140
And Xbox series.

1532
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:07,820
God, I hope it doesn't suck.

1533
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:11,500
How are you feeling right now on the eve of that game?

1534
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:14,700
I am not super excited about it.

1535
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:18,300
I am going to play it, but I am not like hyped on it.

1536
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:21,180
That's a good place to be, because you know what?

1537
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:26,300
It can only exceed your expectations and not be even lower.

1538
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:26,700
Yeah, I know.

1539
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:34,780
But the chances of it exceeding your expectations are much higher than if you're like,

1540
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,740
middle ground, you know, you're not like over.

1541
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:40,300
Like, I just I'm not super excited about it.

1542
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:45,900
It's a better place than where I'm at with Final Fantasy 16, because I know and I'm sitting

1543
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:48,140
here going, do not put the bar too high.

1544
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:50,220
Do not put the bar at a level that is insurmountable.

1545
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:53,420
I can't I can say that on one hand and on the other.

1546
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:58,380
I am completely like, but this game, I'm so hyped for it.

1547
01:34:58,380 --> 01:34:59,660
I cannot wait.

1548
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,660
There are so many talented people involved.

1549
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,100
This is going to be the best thing.

1550
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,100
This will be the best video game that's ever been made.

1551
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:07,500
I can't help it.

1552
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,580
I just the hype machine is in full effect.

1553
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,260
So yeah, but you're in it.

1554
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:13,500
You're in a healthier place for your fandom, Loki.

1555
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:15,420
I don't like that.

1556
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:19,900
I don't like the characters right now as from an outside looking in without actually playing

1557
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:20,940
the game yet.

1558
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:22,780
I don't like the way the characters.

1559
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:24,780
I don't like the characters themselves.

1560
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:27,580
Maybe they'll grow me, you know, and that's perfectly fine.

1561
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:30,860
And I would love to be like surprised by that.

1562
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:32,780
Maybe there'll be a plot twist about the character.

1563
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:37,500
Like the movie Orphan or something, a big revelation that makes the movie 10 times cooler.

1564
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:39,180
20 times.

1565
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:46,700
By the way, Orphan first cut is now apparently on Paramount Plus and it's just as wild.

1566
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:50,860
Like everything I'm here is just as wild.

1567
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:54,300
I hope that it shares something in common with a game that's coming out later in the

1568
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:55,900
week, which we'll get to in just a second here.

1569
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:56,220
OK.

1570
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:59,180
And it is pretty buggy.

1571
01:35:59,180 --> 01:35:59,820
So we'll see.

1572
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:01,820
I hope we'll see.

1573
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:09,740
Anyways, there's also Yars Recharged, which is coming out on PC, Mac, Linux, Nintendo

1574
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:16,780
Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Stadia and Atari VCS.

01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:17,900
Anything with a monitor.

1576
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:19,980
Every everything.

1577
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:20,620
All of it.

1578
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:21,340

1585
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:51,660

01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:53,500

Chin Chan, me and the professor on summer vacation.

The endless seven day journey.

1594
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:26,460
Well, it's not endless if it's only seven days.

1595
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,420
It doesn't make any sense.

1596
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:31,020
That's I guess that's true.

1597
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,180
That's on PlayStation 4.

1604
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:10,140
I'm sure there's something to have different regions there or something.

1605
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:18,620
Nexomon plus Nexomon Extinction Complete Collection on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox

1606
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:19,120
One.

1607
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:27,500
Pac-Man World Repack on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox

1608
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,000
Series.

1609
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:35,740
And last but not least, Soul Hackers 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox

1610
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:36,380
Series.

1611
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:36,940
That's it.

1612
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:39,820
S.J. 100 Matt in chat noting a lot coming out this week.

1613
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:47,020
Yeah, we are in the fourth quarter, that pre-Labor Day kind of pushing out all the third quarter

1614
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:50,140
releases and pretty soon the holiday season.

1615
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:52,300
So, yeah, it's going to be that time of year.

1616
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:55,660
The gaming industry fourth quarter that starts in August and ends in November.

1617
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:56,620
You know that one.

1618
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:57,120
Yeah.

1619
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:00,380
Questbuster says Gamescom also starts this week on the 23rd.

1620
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:01,260
It's true.

1621
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:01,740
That's right.

1622
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:07,580
There's the Jeff Keighley event, which I am pleased to see that they are showcasing Goat

1623
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:08,460
Simulator 3.

1624
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:09,820
So very interested in that.

1625
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:11,420
When is that?

1626
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:12,540
Is that Thursday morning?

1627
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:15,740
I think because I think we got an email Thursday something.

1628
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:19,180
I saw something on Twitter on that.

1629
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:23,020
This may surprise you all, but VOG Network is a friend of Jeff Keighley because he always

1630
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:24,300
emails us about his events.

1631
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,100
I don't mind at all.

1632
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:29,500
This is the only bummer is most of these events are during the working day and and VOG Network

1633
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,660
does not pay any of our bills, believe it or not.

1634
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:35,660
So I can't do both when the day job is conflicted.

1635
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:40,140
So but I'm excited to see what all they do show at the opening night at Gamescom.

1636
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:40,700
That'll be fun.

1637
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:45,020
Okay, let's quickly try to run through Japan's releases.

1638
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,860
But they have a lot as well, but I'll try to make it quick.

1639
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:51,340
So on the Switch, Disco Elysium, the final cut gets a release officially on the Switch

1640
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:52,620
in Japan this week.

1641
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:56,780
We also have SD Gundam Battle Alliance gets released in Japan as well this week.

1642
01:39:56,780 --> 01:40:00,060
Idol Manager, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge.

1643
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,940
Yeah, I guess that wasn't out in Japan yet on the Switch, but that will be coming this

1644
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,780
week on August the 25th.

1645
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:09,980
Pac-Man World Repack also coming out in Japan as it is in the US this week.

1646
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:15,900
And Tetsudon Nippon, Rosentabi Meichi Tetsudon Hen comes out this week as well.

1647
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:22,060
We also have a new Pikachu versus Meowth branded controller that's coming out.

1648
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:22,700
Cool.

1649
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:25,820
If that's something you like to do is collect those various types of controllers.

1650
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:26,940
That's everything on the Switch.

1651
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:28,940
If you want to look on the PlayStation 5, guess what?

1652
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:33,180
If you're a Saints Row fan in Japan, it's also coming out in Japan this week.

1653
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:37,740
There's also a Notorious Edition, which is basically the limited edition also coming

1654
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,700
out in Japan this week.

1655
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:43,500
Disco Elysium is also making its way to the PlayStation 5 in Japan this week.

1656
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:48,300
And Earth Defense Force 6 also hits Japanese PlayStation 5 this week.

1657
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:49,100
But that's not all.

1658
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:57,420
SD Gundam Battle Alliance, Soul Hackers 2, Rustler, Sword and Fairy Together Forever,

1659
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:03,340
Idol Manager, Pac-Man World Repack, all of that on PlayStation 5 this week.

1660
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:06,460
So there's a lot of games on their way.

1661
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:09,820
So all right, let's go to Europe.

1662
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:10,700
Dark Sakura, please.

1663
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:14,620
Actually, not very many things on the list.

1664
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:18,140
Saints Row on August 23rd.

1665
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:20,140
In fact, most of these are August 23rd.

1666
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:22,220
That's on PlayStation and Xbox.

1667
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:24,140
Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?

1668
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,740
On multiple systems.

1669
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:29,820
Nintendo Switch OLED Models Splatoon 3 edition.

1670
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:31,180
So there's that.

1671
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:37,580
Among Us Ejected Edition on PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.

1672
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:43,580
And then on the 26th, we have Soul Hackers 2 and Pac-Man World Repack.

1673
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:47,340
And that's it.

1674
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,140
All righty.

1675
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:52,860
Is anyone curious about the Pac-Man World Repack?

1676
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:53,660
I kind of am.

1677
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:54,620
I kind of want to play it.

1678
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:55,020
I don't know.

1679
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:57,740
After I play all my other Pac-Man games.

1680
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:58,380
Yeah, right.

1681
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:01,180
I saw that museum game to keep pushing through, too.

1682
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:04,380
So is it like a rerelease of the old game?

1683
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:05,340
It's a remaster.

1684
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:07,340
So they've redone it, basically.

1685
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:08,940
So I'm curious about it.

1686
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:11,100
Just can't get excited about Pac-Man.

1687
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:12,940
I see.

1688
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,300
They're very hit and miss for me.

1689
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:15,500
Some of them are crap.

1690
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:20,140
But like Pac-Man Championship Edition and Championship Edition 2 gave that series a

1691
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:21,900
swift kick in the butt that it badly needed.

1692
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:22,780
They were really good.

1693
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:25,740
So like there are good Pac-Man releases still.

1694
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:31,740
I think Pac-Man needs to have like the social media person that controls the Sonic the Hedgehog

1695
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:33,660
Twitter account to like.

1696
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:36,380
No, they need the person that controls the Radio Shack Twitter account.

1697
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:38,540
Maybe not that.

1698
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:39,580
That's a little bit too much.

1699
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:43,260
I want Pac-Man to be edgy.

1700
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:44,860
All right.

1701
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:45,980
That would be pretty edgy.

1702
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:52,700
Let's move on and touch on a few more headlines before we get to listener roundtable and your

1703
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:55,500
thoughts and calls and tweets, etc.

1704
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,380
But first, Loki.

1705
01:42:57,740 --> 01:43:02,860
I'm sure what I'm going to assume that they're going to describe as another horrible misstep.

1706
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:11,660
There's another allegation of Call of Duty stealing other people's artwork again.

1707
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:14,540
So we talked about this a while back or not even a while back.

1708
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:18,140
I think it was a couple of weeks ago about how they had to pull the skin off of their

1709
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:25,260
marketplace because it stole the it basically plagiarized the work of one of the artists

1710
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:26,460
out there that created skin.

1711
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:29,500
Well, this time they're even being more bold about it.

1712
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:34,940
And they are apparently putting out skin that looks awfully similar.

1713
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:42,700
Not quite identical this time, but certainly extremely similar to a heavily inspired by

1714
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:45,020
heavily inspired by.

1715
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:53,660
And this is like by Robert Bolling, or as you may know him, four zero two, who it was

1716
01:43:53,660 --> 01:44:01,500
an Infinity Ward guy now working with Dr. Disrespect on their new game, Midnight Society.

1717
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:07,420
And he actually showed a skin that was going to be in that game.

1718
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:08,700
And oh, look at that.

1719
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:12,220
Now, all of a sudden, it's coming out for Call of Duty.

1720
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:15,980
Yeah, go figure.

1721
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:18,540
This is certainly very, very similar.

1722
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:22,700
Legally distinct, I think is what they call that, right?

1723
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:25,340
All right.

1724
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:26,640
Yeah.

1725
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:31,980
Well, switching gears completely, Dark Soccer has a sad story for us, but one with the silver

1726
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:32,480
lining.

1727
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:33,920
Yeah.

1728
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:43,900
So an indie developer by the name of Rob Hale has recently died, and he left final wishes

1729
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:54,460
that his first published game and its sequel are out for free on Steam.

1730
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:57,660
He's also known as Squid in a Box.

1731
01:44:57,660 --> 01:45:07,100
He died of cancer, and his partner CJ put the announcement out that Waves and the next

1732
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:13,660
game that was in development, Waves 2, would be made free to download on Steam.

1733
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:20,300
CJ is quoted saying this is something Rob was considering anyway with the past two months

1734
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:24,460
as their health entered into more substantial difficulties.

1735
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:28,300
I hope this can be seen as a parting gift to all of those out there that haven't yet

1736
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:29,740
played either of these games.

1737
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:42,620
So both of them are twin-stick shooters, very colorful, very pretty neon lights, and definitely

1738
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:43,980
seem like they're a lot of fun.

1739
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:46,140
So definitely go check it out.

1740
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:52,380
This is a very lovely thing to do to really kind of show the impact that you had on the

1741
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:57,100
world through art, because art is something that many of us contribute in different ways.

1742
01:45:57,820 --> 01:46:01,420
One could argue that this very podcast is in fact art.

1743
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:07,180
It's a certain type of art, but it's art, and art is one of those things that we leave

1744
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:08,300
behind on this world, right?

1745
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:12,780
I call this the found medium, found object medium.

1746
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:15,980
So you would say it's found art or fart for short.

1747
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:20,700
Well, technically it would be found object medium.

1748
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:27,580
But anyway, in all seriousness, and not to laugh at what is otherwise a very serious

1749
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:34,220
thing, this is a very lovely thing to really gift the world your art as you move on to

1750
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:37,980
the next adventure and really show everyone the mark you left behind.

1751
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:38,940
I think that's really cool.

1752
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:42,540
And yeah, I'll definitely check the game out.

1753
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:44,860
I remember hearing about Waze a while ago.

1754
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:48,220
I want to say maybe I even saw it, but I don't think I necessarily played it.

1755
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:49,580
So I'll certainly check it out.

1756
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:50,780
Good chance.

1757
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:58,540
For the record, when I noticed, I mean, both of them are PC games, but Waze 2 actually

1758
01:46:58,540 --> 01:47:01,260
has Steam Deck compatibility if anyone has one.

1759
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:01,760
Neat.

1760
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:04,300
All right, let's move on.

1761
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:05,500
Loki, just a few more stories.

1762
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:12,940
All right, so we always make the joke, you know, what is Doom running on now?

1763
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:17,660
So now someone has gotten Doom to run on a farm tractor.

1764
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:23,020
So now you can, you know, harvest and play Doom at the same time.

1765
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:25,820
And also loop killers.

1766
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:28,620
Sorry, Rob.

1767
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:29,340
That's for Rob.

1768
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:30,620
I get it.

1769
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:31,120
I get it.

1770
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:32,320
All right.

1771
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:36,720
So this was part of this was shown, I guess, at Def Con.

1772
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:43,840
And so they're saying, you know, as part of this process, they use the source port dehacked

1773
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:44,340
Doom.

1774
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:52,080
And then, of course, another modder, Skelligant, was able to create a farm themed Doom mod

1775
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:56,080
to be able to play on the John Deere's tractor jailbroken system.

1776
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:56,580
Of course.

1777
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:01,920
It's less important that the John Deere tractors run Doom.

1778
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,760
It's more important that they've jailbroken the system because John Deere locks down a

1779
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:11,280
lot of these computers and stuff for they're trying to stop right to repair.

1780
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:19,040
So that is really the motivation for them to, you know, try to hack the John Deere systems.

1781
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:23,040
But of course, you know, if you hack something, you want to show that you can run Doom on

1782
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,160
it because why not?

1783
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:25,280
Orange right.

1784
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:29,440
With a very good question in chat saying sooner or later, we'll see Doom running in farm

1785
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,080
simulator.

1786
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,440
That would be very meta, right?

1787
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,520
Have Doom in farming simulator on the tractor.

1788
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,920
Yeah, that would be I can't wait.

1789
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:37,280
All right.

1790
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:42,960
Or just have like the marine be on a tractor driving through over, you know, demons in

1791
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:43,460
hell.

1792
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:48,640
Oh, so basically make it Doom, but farming.

1793
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,600
No, he's not farming anything.

1794
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,000
He's just running over people with a tractor or demons.

1795
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:55,840
He's far.

1796
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:56,880
He's farming kills.

1797
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:58,400
Farming kills.

1798
01:48:58,400 --> 01:48:58,960
Exactly.

1799
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,680
Farming kills.

1800
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:04,880
I farm blood points on a tractor in Dead by Daylight.

1801
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,480
Womp womp.

1802
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,520
Womp womp.

1803
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:08,020
All right.

1804
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,680
We have one more announcement tonight.

1805
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,040
One more story to get into.

1806
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,480
Do you remember last week we had an announcement of an announcement?

1807
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:19,120
It was Sunsoft was set to reveal something.

1808
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:24,080
Well, they revealed it, and the game they announced was Iki Unite.

1809
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:30,240
It is a revival of a 1985 arcade and Famicom roguelike game for PC.

1810
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:36,800
It's going to launch in 2022, but this will support up to 16 players online.

1811
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:41,840
And there's a very, very, very short teaser video that's out there, but it is something

1812
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:46,720
you can kind of check out to see the game in motion there, which it's interesting because

1813
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:52,320
I've heard people say it just looks like they're riding the vampire survivors train.

1814
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:59,040
And even though this is a remake or reimagining, if you will, of a game that was made in 1985,

1815
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:06,640
yeah, I'm definitely getting the vampire survivors vibe from this game.

1816
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:10,800
Yeah, which is, you know, there's a lot of knockoff games for that right now,

1817
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:11,840
so I'm not really surprised.

1818
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,440
And that's a great game.

1819
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:17,360
So, yeah, but that was the big Sunsoft reveal was this particular game.

1820
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:21,280
So sorry if you were like me and you were waiting for Fester's Quest to come back.

1821
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Unfortunately, that will not be coming out.

1822
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,320
However, before I get to listen to Roundtable,

1823
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,200
does anyone else see that trailer for the Wednesday Netflix series?

1824
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:30,160
Yes.

1825
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,560
I think it looks really good.

1826
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:36,320
I think there's a lot of people that are ready to hate on it, but I think it looks good.

1827
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:40,320
First off, and I think a lot of people have already addressed this,

1828
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:44,080
but I'm just going to say I don't have any problem with Luis Guzman as

1829
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:48,000
Gomez, and they made him look more like the comics.

1830
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:48,560
It's fine.

1831
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:54,400
Yeah, that was the thing is that they thought Raul Julia was too handsome to be a proper Gomez.

1832
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,440
Which fair.

1833
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,240
He was a handsome fucking guy.

1834
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:03,520
Short and very stout and not all that good looking.

1835
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:08,000
Yeah, so but I loved the tone of the trailer.

1836
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:12,400
It was that perfect blend of very dry humor.

1837
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:14,720
Who did they cast?

1838
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:16,720
Jenny Ortega, I think is her name.

1839
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:19,600
She was also the girl in the opening scene in the new screen movie.

1840
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:20,800
She's having a great year.

1841
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,360
She's great.

1842
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:25,280
She had just that right amount of dryness in that scene and everything.

1843
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:25,760
It was good.

1844
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:26,560
I enjoyed it.

1845
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,680
So I don't get excited about it on TV, any show.

1846
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,920
Yeah, but I'm excited for that one.

1847
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:34,000
And some people were saying that it was too much.

1848
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:36,240
They shouldn't be making dick jokes.

1849
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:38,000
No, they didn't.

1850
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,480
They listen very carefully to the words they chose and the way they did it.

1851
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,040
There's a lot there.

1852
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,680
That's your dirty ass brain filling in the gaps.

1853
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:50,720
They did not explicitly say the Piranha was biting him in the dick.

1854
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:53,520
So just something to do that.

1855
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:59,680
So, um, DJ says, uh, Luis Guzman is too much of an oblong head and his hair looks like

1856
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:00,960
a cheap toupee recast.

1857
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,480
I will say the hair.

1858
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:07,120
The hair is the one thing where I'm like, and I could see where people take issue with

1859
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:14,080
that, but I, I think it's one of those things where it's like the, the, um, what would

1860
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,560
you call it?

1861
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:20,800
The, um, the, the meter was turned up to 11 in the, um, over the top department with that

1862
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:21,680
wig, I think.

1863
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:24,480
So, but I, I, I, I'm excited to see the emotion.

1864
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:28,560
The other thing to keep in mind, he's actually not a main character in this show.

1865
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
So he's in it, but he's not a main character.

1866
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,880
So, cause it's, it's a Wednesday spinoff show.

1867
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:38,000
So Wednesday's main character, I believe Morticia is for some reason.

1868
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:41,200
Um, but yeah, so I'm excited for the show to be honest.

1869
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:42,400
Yeah.

1870
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:48,400
And I'm putting a link for those who don't know, I'm putting a link in chat of what,

1871
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,720
what the original comic Gomez looked like.

1872
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:53,120
Yeah.

1873
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:54,880
And pretty much how perfect.

1874
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:00,000
Um, yeah, as I also agree with Sarah when I'm at, apparently they're keeping Fester's

1875
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,920
casting under really tight lock and key.

1876
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:02,960
So it's gotta be big.

1877
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:03,200
Yeah.

1878
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:08,640
There's been no, nothing on who is playing Fester or if Fester's even in the show, it

1879
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:11,040
could be one of those things where he's not showing up to later season.

1880
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:12,080
I don't know, but we'll see.

1881
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:14,960
What if they got Christopher Lloyd to do it again?

1882
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:15,680
That'd be amazing.

1883
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:19,840
Christopher Lloyd though has like lost a lot of weight.

1884
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:20,560
Oh yeah.

1885
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:21,840
He, and he is in his late eighties.

1886
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,160
He's, he's fairly up there.

1887
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:24,660
Yeah.

1888
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,680
Even just for a scene, just for a scene.

1889
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:28,180
All right.

1890
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:32,580
Uh, let's get into, although, you know, who is in it.

1891
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:34,980
I will say who is in it is Christina Ricci's in it.

1892
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:36,580
And they're not saying who she's playing.

1893
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:37,780
Now.

1894
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:44,740
I don't know if she's that, that, that would be a hoot if she's uncle Fester, but I don't

1895
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:45,380
think so either.

1896
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:46,500
I don't see how that works.

1897
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,340
I think she'd be like a teacher or something.

1898
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:52,900
I think, I think, I think she goes the complete off opposite and she's like the harmony hut

1899
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,580
lady in this, uh, this one.

1900
01:53:54,580 --> 01:53:55,620
So we'll see what happens.

1901
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:56,820
All right.

1902
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:58,740
Anyway, let's get to the listener round table.

1903
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:03,060
We will take on any questions that you might have as well as your tweets and your emails

1904
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:07,460
over at, uh, participate at orange lounge radio.com.

1905
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:10,900
I think I saw at least one, uh, uh, for reading tonight.

1906
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:11,620
So let's get to it.

1907
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:12,660
Uh, our email tonight.

1908
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:16,420
Um, this comes from Ziva.

1909
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:16,740
Yay.

1910
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:23,860
A free com, a free company in final fantasy 14 called, uh, Cirque is doing a production

1911
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:25,780
of clue on August 27th.

1912
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:31,380
It starts at 9 PM EST on the Matias server, which is on the crystal data center.

1913
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:37,540
They perform all of their productions inside their free company house that is located in

1914
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:41,220
the lavender beds residential zone in ward 10 house three.

1915
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:47,460
Since data center travel is now a thing, and I know there might be a handful of people

1916
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:48,420
interested in this.

1917
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:50,900
I thought I would email about it.

1918
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:53,060
I also posted this on the discord.

1919
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:57,620
Some of Cirque's past productions were beauty and the beast, Rocky horror picture show,

1920
01:54:57,620 --> 01:55:01,940
little mermaid, labyrinth, the room, princess bride, and street fighter.

1921
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:05,860
Every single one of their performances are well scripted and choreographed.

1922
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:11,140
They have the players who obviously act out the parts players who are in charge of the

1923
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:17,060
lighting and effects, and they give out watch together link, which has the music, um, arrive

1924
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:18,500
early because it fills up quickly.

1925
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:24,020
If you don't play final fantasy 14, but are interested in seeing this in game, you can

1926
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:29,620
create a free trial account on Matias and choose Gridania as your starting town.

1927
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:35,140
Then you can get to the lavender beds residential zone by talking to a central shroud skipper

1928
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:37,380
NPC outside of Gridania.

1929
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:43,380
You can also pick up a level 10 quest at bench brand in central shroud.

1930
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:48,260
Once complete, you can work to lavender beds using the main grid on yet either right at

1931
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:48,980
no charge.

1932
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:54,740
If you don't want to make an account and still are interested in seeing the, uh, the production,

1933
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:56,660
there's usually a live stream.

1934
01:55:56,660 --> 01:56:01,620
If anyone has any questions, feel free to send me a DM on discord.

1935
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:03,540
Hope to see some of you there.

1936
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:04,420
And that's from Ziba.

1937
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:07,300
Oh, TD alcoholics and chat.

1938
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:07,800
Hi.

1939
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,580
Um, thank you Ziba for that.

1940
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:13,140
And yeah, Ziba tweeted that at me and you know, I was like, oh, I

1941
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:14,020
definitely want to come.

1942
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:17,460
The only bummer is I just found out, well, it's not a bummer for me, but it's a bummer

1943
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:17,780
for this.

1944
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:21,220
I just found out that my friend from San Diego is going to be here visiting that same day.

1945
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:22,980
So I'm not sure I can actually go live.

1946
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:24,740
So I really hope it's on YouTube.

1947
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:31,220
I'm really curious if it's the movie or the play because it sounds like they've done plays

1948
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:31,780
in there.

1949
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:34,260
And most people know clue through the movie.

1950
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:37,780
Specifically said Rocky horror picture show is done.

1951
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:38,980
Not the Rocky horror show.

1952
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:39,780
Oh, good catch.

1953
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:40,180
Good catch.

1954
01:56:40,180 --> 01:56:42,100
So they're basically redoing movies in there.

1955
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:42,420
Okay.

1956
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:42,900
Interesting.

1957
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:48,580
Um, yeah, because there was a separate clue Broadway play about 10 years or off-Broadway

1958
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:49,780
or one of those about 10 years ago.

1959
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:50,260
So, okay.

1960
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:51,860
So they're doing the movie.

1961
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:56,340
Well, I'm curious because you don't see movies staged a lot.

1962
01:56:56,340 --> 01:57:01,380
Although ironically, I did see a stage production of clue the movie.

1963
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:03,140
They were kind of doing it under the radar.

1964
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:04,340
I saw it in San Francisco.

1965
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:06,500
This is the same theater company.

1966
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:11,940
Like six months later, they did star Wars and they got shut down in a heartbeat.

1967
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:16,420
Some, unfortunately they're a little too close to Lucasfilm store being in San Francisco

1968
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:17,860
and they got shut down for doing star Wars.

1969
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:22,260
But I wa I saw them do clue like six months prior and it was a lot of fun.

1970
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:25,140
So that is the first time I saw Mrs.

1971
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:26,820
Peacock played by a man.

1972
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:28,340
And I thought it was great.

1973
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:30,900
And I, I swore one day I would play Mrs.

1974
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,340
Peacock and I did.

1975
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:35,140
So that was, that was because of that performance.

1976
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:36,180
I had a great time with that.

1977
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:39,460
So, uh, but yeah, I'm, I'm excited to check it out.

1978
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:41,460
I really, really, really hope they archive it on YouTube.

1979
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:45,220
If I can't be there live, because I might, I might, because the East coast time difference,

1980
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:47,060
I might be able to be there for at least a little bit.

1981
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:49,220
So I'll be curious, but it sounds great.

1982
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:51,940
So completely off topic.

1983
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:52,180
Yeah.

1984
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:56,500
I'm sad that you're not watching celebrity drag race because then we would have something

1985
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,940
to talk about if no one emails.

1986
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:04,900
No, I just, I, I, I have to be careful how much dry grace I consume or I get sick of

1987
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:04,980
it.

1988
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:08,020
Like that's why I don't bother with any of the international versions anymore.

1989
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:09,300
I don't watch any of them.

1990
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:11,380
Although I'm pretty good.

1991
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:17,220
I heard drag race Philippines is like next level drama.

1992
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:18,900
Like it's apparently really good.

1993
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:23,940
And it's the only non U S edition to have an untucked.

1994
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:25,460
And for good reason, apparently.

1995
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:30,580
So I saw some clips floating around Twitter.

1996
01:58:30,580 --> 01:58:31,220
It looked great.

1997
01:58:32,020 --> 01:58:35,060
So anyway, it's great to see DDR alcoholic.

1998
01:58:35,060 --> 01:58:36,260
Hey, heads up.

1999
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:37,300
So, so do your call.

2000
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:40,340
Like the reason why we're all a fanning and fawning is because that's somebody we used

2001
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:45,300
to play DDR with back in the day, uh, over at Roseville, in the years that this show

2002
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:45,940
was formed.

2003
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:46,260
Right.

2004
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:48,420
I would be curious.

2005
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:49,540
Well, I guess did your call.

2006
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:51,860
It kind of lives a little ways away now from what I remember.

2007
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:56,340
So she's not around the corner anymore, but I'd be curious if you ever made your way up

2008
01:58:56,340 --> 01:59:01,140
to round one now that it's open in Roseville, I guess that's quite a distance, but it's

2009
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:02,180
worth asking.

2010
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:07,940
Cause just, just to, just to see, just to see how it's evolved and the kids today playing

2011
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:09,060
the same games.

2012
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:11,700
So I'd be curious.

2013
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:13,220
All right.

2014
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:18,420
Let's get to some tweets at least over at twitter.com slash O L R because I know there

2015
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:23,780
was at least, I want to give a shout out to SSJ 100, Matt, who number one was the only

2016
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:29,700
person who actually tweeted us a picture of their O L R setup, complete with cameo doggy

2017
01:59:29,700 --> 01:59:30,100
there.

2018
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:30,980
So enjoy that.

2019
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:32,100
That was great.

2020
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:33,220
I retweeted that as well.

2021
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:34,980
So, oh, actually, no, I didn't.

2022
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:36,820
Cause it's a locked account so I can only reply.

2023
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:41,300
So I guess I just showed somebody's private tweet, but I have a feeling he won't mind.

2024
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:41,620
All right.

2025
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:43,780
Let's see.

2026
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:51,300
Then number two for SSJ 100, Matt, I completely stole a meme he put in our discord and I passed

2027
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:52,100
it off as our own.

2028
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:53,220
Did you see that one Loki?

2029
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:57,220
Because he, he did the meme of the, the, I don't know, it looked like the girl yelling

2030
01:59:57,220 --> 02:00:01,860
at the guy at the festival or whatever with the whole little like written message in all

2031
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:02,580
caps.

2032
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:07,780
Then the written message says, so then Loki said that if this weird card game sold 1 million

2033
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:10,820
copies, he would wear a costume of this character called Tingle.

2034
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:11,940
And there's a whole thing on that.

2035
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:12,820
I thought it was funny.

2036
02:00:13,460 --> 02:00:16,180
That's, that's why I stole it and made it, made it our own.

2037
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:20,100
So thank you, SSJ 100, Matt, for letting me steal that without suing.

2038
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:26,980
Now, something else that got tweeted over to us, Dark Tetsuya actually tweeted us saying,

2039
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:28,340
I thought this was cool.

2040
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:33,060
Um, a recently preserved prototype version of NES NARC.

2041
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:35,460
You remember that game from the early nineties?

2042
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:36,900
I remember the arcade version.

2043
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:37,140
Yes.

2044
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:37,940
There was an arcade.

2045
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:40,260
It also had a cameo in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

2046
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,100
And I think, wasn't there a Super Nintendo version?

2047
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:43,540
Yeah, I think.

2048
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:44,040
Yeah.

2049
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:50,100
But there was supposed to be an NES version before Nintendo's sensors stepped in.

2050
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:54,020
So, uh, embedded a tweet from the account Forest Illusion.

2051
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:59,380
We preserved a prototype of NARC for the Nintendo Entertainment System developed by Rare Limited.

2052
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:03,780
According to the front label, this build was intended for demo purposes at CES.

2053
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:08,900
As for the build itself, it's uncensored and features various references to smoking

2054
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:10,500
and illicit drugs.

2055
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:14,100
And now that it's on the internet, of course, anybody can check it out there.

2056
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:15,780
It's available to check out.

2057
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:19,620
You can see a whole thing on YouTube and they have some screenshots as well of what like

2058
02:01:19,620 --> 02:01:22,340
the game looked like and so forth on the NES.

2059
02:01:22,340 --> 02:01:23,700
So, uh, pretty cool.

2060
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:30,260
Fifth dream in chats is I played NARC so much in the Walmart lobby when I was a kid.

2061
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:31,140
Yeah.

2062
02:01:32,980 --> 02:01:34,820
That says a lot about the nineties right there.

2063
02:01:36,020 --> 02:01:37,300
But thank you for that tweet.

2064
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:39,060
That was everything we got on Twitter this week.

2065
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:43,860
Uh, I have to say I talked about NARC being in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

2066
02:01:43,860 --> 02:01:45,300
I was referring to the first movie.

2067
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:45,540
Oh yeah.

2068
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:45,860
The movie.

2069
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:46,420
Yeah.

2070
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:47,620
The one from the nineties.

2071
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:49,140
Yeah.

2072
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:49,380
So.

2073
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:52,500
The only movie TV.

2074
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:56,260
No, there were, there were, there were, I liked, I liked the third one.

2075
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:56,420
Yeah.

2076
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:57,860
I liked the third one too.

2077
02:01:57,860 --> 02:01:59,700
I didn't even hate the second one.

2078
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:05,540
My friend and I watched that third one at least like 20 times.

2079
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:11,300
So I could quote the whole entire first movie with my friend Courtney.

2080
02:02:12,180 --> 02:02:18,420
And we would do it when one of our friends at our little group at our lunch table would

2081
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:21,460
speak very loudly with her mouth full of food.

2082
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:24,260
I love it.

2083
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:25,700
All right.

2084
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:27,540
I don't think I ever watched the third one.

2085
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,380
I was just the first and second one.

2086
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:30,420
They go back to ancient.

2087
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:30,980
Interesting.

2088
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:32,340
The third one is the time machine.

2089
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:33,860
They go back to ancient Japan.

2090
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:34,100
Yeah.

2091
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:34,900
That sounds stupid.

2092
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:37,140
Not bad.

2093
02:02:37,140 --> 02:02:38,340
It had some fun stuff in it.

2094
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:42,020
It is, but in that awesome nineties kind of way.

2095
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:44,580
I don't know how else to explain it.

2096
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:51,860
Do you remember the karate kid part two, which involved him going to Okinawa?

2097
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:55,460
That movie was fucking good.

2098
02:02:55,460 --> 02:03:00,900
Like, you know, sometimes that whole, you know, uh, in a new pond type of situation

2099
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:01,860
works out very well.

2100
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:07,700
There though, a lot of people will say that in some cases, sequels are either utter trash

2101
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:08,980
or they're the best of the series.

2102
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:11,220
I know a lot of people prefer empire strikes back.

2103
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:12,980
I am a Jedi return to the Jedi person.

2104
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:20,820
There are people, you know, who say that every, you know, even numbered, um, uh, star Trek

2105
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:24,020
movie is good, you know?

2106
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:28,020
So now I'm thinking about karate kid part two.

2107
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:29,700
You remember that scene with the drums?

2108
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:32,020
That was, Oh, chills, chills.

2109
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:32,500
So good.

2110
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:34,500
I saw that in the theater, Rob.

2111
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:34,820
Yeah.

2112
02:03:34,820 --> 02:03:36,660
I think I saw that one in the theater too.

2113
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,860
I remember it was really scary.

2114
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:45,460
The power, uh, the, the, the glory of love on 45.

2115
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:48,260
I love it.

2116
02:03:49,060 --> 02:03:52,180
Do you kids, you know what a 45 is?

2117
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:53,540
It's a tiny record.

2118
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:58,100
And it usually had one song on both sides, which is where the term B side comes from.

2119
02:03:58,820 --> 02:04:03,300
That's why your record player had a switch to go from 33 to 45.

2120
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:04,420
So this is funny.

2121
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:10,980
Um, tiger is not just to play the songs in a weird, you know, no, it's not.

2122
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:13,460
Um, what was I going to say about karate kid?

2123
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:14,820
There was a third movie.

2124
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:16,900
I completely can't remember it.

2125
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:20,420
Like it was back in LA and I do not remember the plot whatsoever.

2126
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:23,060
And no, I have not seen Cobra Kai or any of the followups.

2127
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:28,500
Like it's really just about the very, I did see next karate kid, not, not the Will Smith

2128
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:31,220
kid, uh, yeah, Hillary Swank.

2129
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:31,540
I did.

2130
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:36,420
I re I saw that one at the 99 cent theater and we're going to leave it at that.

2131
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:44,740
Um, tiger class says, I just thought it was silly that they had to make, um, Pat Morita

2132
02:04:44,740 --> 02:04:45,940
dude, the fake accent.

2133
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:47,000
Yeah.

2134
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:51,940
Um, tiger con chat says, speaking of the karate kid, you heard the creators of Cobra

2135
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:54,580
Kai are going to do a spinoff of Ferris Bueller's day off.

2136
02:04:54,580 --> 02:04:54,980
I did.

2137
02:04:54,980 --> 02:04:59,620
I think I saw you or someone post that in our discord, but it's, it's odd.

2138
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:00,020
Okay.

2139
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:04,260
So do you remember in Ferris Bueller's day off when he goes to take the car to valet

2140
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:07,380
parking, that the valets go and they take it on a joy ride.

2141
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:12,020
And like, there's that one scene of them going over the Hill and that whole thing that,

2142
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:13,140
that is the spinoff.

2143
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:16,580
They're making a movie about the valet guys going on a joy ride.

2144
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:18,820
That's stupid, right?

2145
02:05:18,820 --> 02:05:22,180
It's like all of all the spinoffs you can make.

2146
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:23,540
That's what you're making.

2147
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:24,040
Okay.

2148
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:30,900
I mean, I guess all the other actors are too old now and you could probably replace those

2149
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:34,660
actors and not many people would notice, but that's interesting.

2150
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:37,300
Then why even bring Ferris Bueller's day off into it?

2151
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:41,620
Like just, I think Matthew Broderick is a producer on it or something.

2152
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:48,020
I think it's just, it could be like, I want to make trashy ideas.

2153
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:52,180
Why don't we make a movie about all the baby Godzillas from Godzilla USA?

2154
02:05:52,180 --> 02:05:56,500
I will wait for at least a trailer, but it just like in principle, it's just kind of

2155
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:57,220
like, huh?

2156
02:05:58,020 --> 02:06:00,420
Do you know, do you know who needs a spinoff movie?

2157
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:03,220
You know, who needs to spin off Edie McClurg.

2158
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:06,900
And I don't know if you've apparently she's not doing too well.

2159
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:08,340
Um, I mean, bless her heart.

2160
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:12,580
She's, you know, she was a theater queen in the eighties and you know, now it's 40 years

2161
02:06:12,580 --> 02:06:12,820
later.

2162
02:06:12,820 --> 02:06:14,260
So she's up there in age.

2163
02:06:14,260 --> 02:06:19,700
And apparently, um, apparently there's some elder care issues going on there that don't

2164
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:20,340
sound great.

2165
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:25,460
And it just, my heart breaks because she is such an icon of the eighties, Edie McClurg.

2166
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:29,940
If you don't know who Edie McClurg is, Ferris Bueller's day off, she was the secretary

2167
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:32,180
in that movie with those iconic lines.

2168
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:38,020
And she was also in that, um, uh, with the Steve Martin, she's the one that Steve Martin

2169
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:40,500
rants out in planes, trains, and automobiles.

2170
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:42,900
Like, you know, basically like, fuck you lady type of thing.

2171
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:45,140
And she just completely fucks him over.

2172
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:47,300
Like she, it's an iconic piece of cinema.

2173
02:06:47,860 --> 02:06:48,100
Yep.

2174
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,020
DJ Ramesh says Small Wonder.

2175
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:50,820
Absolutely.

2176
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:52,820
She was the nosy neighbor in Small Wonder.

2177
02:06:52,820 --> 02:06:53,860
The Hogan family.

2178
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:55,220
She was famous on that as well.

2179
02:06:55,220 --> 02:07:00,900
And, and Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

2180
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:04,100
She was the one and only Chastity Pariah.

2181
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:05,060
Thank you very much.

2182
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:09,380
If you've never seen Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, fix it.

2183
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:12,580
An iconic, iconic piece of cinema.

2184
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:20,260
You won't understand my sexuality unless you watch Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

2185
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:21,860
I don't know how else to say it.

2186
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:28,660
No, I have one more thing to say.

2187
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:33,220
RuPaul was not the first famous drag queen.

2188
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:36,500
RuPaul was not the first famous drag queen.

2189
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:40,820
Elvira predates RuPaul.

2190
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:46,260
Cassandra Peterson, better known as Elvira, 100% a drag queen.

2191
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:47,540
100%.

2192
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:52,260
That was a drag performance all of those years and continuing now.

2193
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:54,660
And the best.

2194
02:07:56,100 --> 02:07:57,220
Where's her reality show?

2195
02:07:57,220 --> 02:07:58,500
Actually, she had a reality show.

2196
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:00,180
They tried, they did like a next Elvira.

2197
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:01,060
It wasn't, it wasn't good.

2198
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:01,780
It was low budget.

2199
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:02,420
It was not good.

2200
02:08:02,420 --> 02:08:03,300
No, that's too bad.

2201
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:05,780
All right.

2202
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:11,220
Anyway, I don't see any calls coming into the green room over at vognetwork.com slash

2203
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:11,780
Discord.

2204
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:12,900
The purple room.

2205
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:14,740
But I will ask quickly.

2206
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:17,220
TigerClaw says they should do a new Elvira movie.

2207
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:22,340
They did one later, Elvira's Haunted Hills, because Richard O'Brien, famous from the

2208
02:08:22,340 --> 02:08:24,020
Rocky Horror Picture Show is also in that.

2209
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:27,220
It's not, not really as iconic.

2210
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:30,740
It's one of those things, you know, it has a few gags, but it's one of those things

2211
02:08:30,740 --> 02:08:34,660
where it's like you just keep waiting for the, it just doesn't live up to the 80s one.

2212
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:41,540
I thought I had heard they were going to do one more, but she's, she doesn't like to

2213
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:42,980
do the character so much anymore.

2214
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:44,900
You know, she's getting up there in age.

2215
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:49,540
She doesn't like to, you know, get all put up together for that anymore.

2216
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:51,700
I don't think she, she loves doing it.

2217
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:55,140
So she, if you, if you want her to do it, you got to pay her a lot of money.

2218
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:59,940
By the way, as a new Elvira pinball table has been in my house.

2219
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:00,420
Yeah.

2220
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:02,580
Yes, they very much know that it exists.

2221
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:02,900
Yeah.

2222
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:03,220
Yeah.

2223
02:09:03,220 --> 02:09:07,060
It's a lovely, lovely piece of technology.

2224
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:10,260
All right, let's move on.

2225
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:13,620
Uh, I was going to ask any final, uh, stories tonight.

2226
02:09:13,620 --> 02:09:14,420
Last minute stories.

2227
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:14,920
Loki.

2228
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:25,220
Uh, I was going to say that this week, um, there there's been some teasing at 2k on

2229
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:30,980
Twitter saying, uh, you know, they're celebrating the 15th anniversary of bio shock.

2230
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:36,260
Could we be in for a bio shock announcement at gamescom?

2231
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:38,500
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

2232
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:42,100
Um, how about seven 2k games?

2233
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:42,900
How about seven?

2234
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:45,620
I'm not sure about that.

2235
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:46,260
Well, it's about it.

2236
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:48,100
No, it's about time for civilization seven.

2237
02:09:48,100 --> 02:09:49,300
I'd be down for that.

2238
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:56,580
There was a, uh, there was kind of a highlight reel that was done by HBO, uh, for HBO now.

2239
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:58,020
And they deleted it.

2240
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:00,820
It's deleted.

2241
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:03,220
It's a joke because of HBO max and everything going on.

2242
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:03,720
Yeah.

2243
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:09,160
Yeah, well, yeah, for HBO max, uh, showing off, uh, some of the uncharted series.

2244
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:14,920
So, or not uncharted last of us getting all the Sony properties mixed up today.

2245
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:15,420
Yeah.

2246
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:18,040
The last of us TV series.

2247
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:18,920
Watch it while you can.

2248
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:24,440
Look to me, they'll, they'll, they'll banish it just like they did Sesame street.

2249
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,960
Who gets rid of Sesame street?

2250
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:28,680
Who does that?

2251
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:31,880
People that think the Sesame street can't make them money is why.

2252
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:36,200
People that only look at dollar signs and not, you know, Goodwill.

2253
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:42,200
This episode was brought to you by the letters F and U and the word discovery.

2254
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:48,280
Anyway, uh, any other last minute stories to share with us?

2255
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:50,760
Well, that's pretty much it.

2256
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:53,000
All right.

2257
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,280
Well, uh, I think we will, sorry.

2258
02:10:56,280 --> 02:11:00,520
As the show, one hundred mat says clown show and pod culture says that's an insult to clowns.

2259
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:01,020
Yes.

2260
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:03,800
All right.

2261
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:06,360
Uh, let's wrap it up.

2262
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:08,040
Uh, that is going to be it.

2263
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:09,720
Uh, let's get to our final thoughts.

2264
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:12,280
Thank you as always for listening to orange on radio.

2265
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:15,800
If you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend about the show, uh, help us, uh, spread

2266
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:18,680
the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices

2267
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:19,640
to put out on the air.

2268
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:24,280
So, uh, tell a friend or five, uh, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, uh,

2269
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:25,320
goes an awful long way.

2270
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:28,680
Spotify, wherever it is you listen to this show, uh, spread the word.

2271
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:29,080
Sorry.

2272
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:31,640
It's not video game news, but something did come up.

2273
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:32,140
Okay.

2274
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:36,760
Cole of the cats, Cole and marmalade has passed away.

2275
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:37,260
Oh.

2276
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:41,800
Anyway, I didn't mean to bring it all down.

2277
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:43,560
Yeah, way to ruin the mood.

2278
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:48,920
No, a lot of people follow Cole and marmalade and I just thought I would say something.

2279
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:50,200
All right.

2280
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:52,760
Uh, well, you're gonna, here's your chance to make it better.

2281
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:55,400
Dark Sakura, leave us with a happier final thought tonight.

2282
02:11:56,440 --> 02:12:01,000
Um, uh, I'm gonna play some dead by daylight.

2283
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:02,380
Have fun.

2284
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:04,440
Enjoy the stabbing.

2285
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:05,960
Later taters.

2286
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:06,460
Bye.

2287
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:07,340
Bye.

2288
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:09,720
Loki will go to you with your final thought tonight.

2289
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:14,280
I can't wait to stream my disappointment of the new saints road game.

2290
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:18,600
Well, hopefully I'll be disappointed, but not a lot of people seem positive about it.

2291
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:22,360
There's been some gameplay footage that's come out and people aren't happy.

2292
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:30,840
And my final, my final thought tonight is, um, I, I am really excited for dragon con.

2293
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:32,040
I want to play that game.

2294
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:33,480
That's, uh, behind you tonight.

2295
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:33,880
Loki.

2296
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:38,520
It's on my list of things to pick up this week is that I may stream that too, but that

2297
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:39,560
looks really fun.

2298
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,560
You should get on the streaming bandwagon.

2299
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:42,280
It's fun.

2300
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:42,920
All right.

2301
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:44,040
Uh, that's going to do it.

2302
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:47,560
Thank you so much for, uh, uh, tuning in for another episode of orange launch radio.

2303
02:12:47,560 --> 02:12:49,000
Oh, look, I got to get your final thought.

2304
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:50,840
Oh no, I did.

2305
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:51,160
You did.

2306
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:51,660
I did.

2307
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:53,320
I thought I skipped you.

2308
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:53,820
Okay.

2309
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:55,800
I'm really, I'm really burned out.

2310
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:57,880
Uh, Bob Blackhoof wants to name one more time.

2311
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:00,120
It's arcade paradise.

2312
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:00,680
Paradise.

2313
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:01,320
That's it.

2314
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:01,560
Okay.

2315
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:03,480
Arcade on steam right now.

2316
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:04,360
And it looks awesome.

2317
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,840
Uh, it's turning a laundry mat into an arcade, but like there's many games that you actually

2318
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:10,680
play of the machines that you install.

2319
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:18,760
So yeah, the way they describe it, it is, um, a nineties field retro retro arcade adventure

2320
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:20,760
rather than washing rags for a living.

2321
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:23,640
You decide to turn your family laundromat into the ultimate arcade.

2322
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:25,160
There you go.

2323
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:25,660
Nice.

2324
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:26,520
All right.

2325
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:28,520
That's going to do it, uh, for another episode of orange.

2326
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:32,920
We will be back next week, uh, in seven days to do this all over again.

2327
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:34,600
So I hope you'll join us at that point.

2328
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:35,640
Have a good week, everybody.

2329
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:36,600
Happy gaming.

2330
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:37,100
