0	12700	It's pronounced Koch Media.
12700	16300	This week, we have a headline about Sunsoft announcing that they'll announce news this
16300	17300	week!
17300	19400	Seriously, that's the whole article.
19400	24400	They included a single quote from the press release and the About Sunsoft block, and that's
24400	25400	it.
25400	26400	Yeah.
26400	28240	This is just one headline before the headline.
28240	31400	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about
31400	35080	their favorite memories of Sunsoft and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right
35080	38080	now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
38080	41960	Jason, it's what we call a slow news week.
41960	44040	Oh, hello, my friends out there on the internet.
44040	48280	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48280	50660	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
50660	57080	We are live with you once again for episode number 926 of our show for August the 14th
57080	58760	of 2022.
58760	62720	My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined by my co-hosts.
62720	66080	First off, showing off her merch and the hook of shame.
66080	68960	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
68960	70440	I was actually just stretching.
70440	73280	Oh, I thought you were doing a product placement.
73280	74280	Well, how about that?
74280	78520	How do you like my Pikachu I've got on my shirt here?
78520	79680	Not my merch, though.
79680	83960	I think Nintendo would shut me down immediately if I try, or a Pokemon company, if I tried
83960	84960	to do a Pikachu shirt.
84960	91080	Although I'm pretty sure I might be leaving my current merch location, so we'll see.
91080	92080	You know what?
92080	93800	We still have to set up a new VOG store.
93800	98480	We kind of never really got around to that once we closed the old one, so lots to look
98480	99480	forward to.
99480	103040	There's another one that Elsie uses that I'm going to ask about that apparently they don't
103040	106320	have as big of a selection, but they've got really good material.
106320	111200	Okay, I'm all for like material and solid shirt, because you remember back in the day,
111200	113200	and I'm not even sure if this company is still around.
113960	116360	Was it Cafe-E-Press or Cafe-Press or something?
116360	119120	It was called Cafe-Press, and they're still around.
119120	120120	Oh, are they still around?
120120	121120	Sorry.
121120	124480	Now, disclaimer, I haven't used this site in like 10 years, but I just remember it was
124480	129000	the first site that everybody would print their own shirts on, and it was a big printing
129000	130240	on demand industry.
130240	136240	Those shirts were terrible, because the logos would rub off the first time you washed the
136240	137240	shirt.
137240	138240	They did not last.
138240	141800	I'm a fan of Redbubble.
141880	148000	They have the ringer shirts now, and I think that that's really cool.
148000	154800	I'm looking at Cafe-Press right now, and they have bumper stickers and different things,
154800	158040	so I might look into that.
158040	162440	Also joining us, Techmaster Loki, who's dying to say something here, what?
162440	163880	Don't go to Redbubble.
163880	171680	Their quality is very inconsistent, seriously, because our group, them with Channel 64, we
171680	175560	were looking at doing merchandise, and Redbubble was one of the places that we looked at, and
175560	178720	we ordered several shirts from them.
178720	182540	Some were okay, some were terrible, and it was just inconsistent.
182540	184240	The printing was offset.
184240	188280	It wasn't just ... It was very inconsistent.
188280	189280	It's a bummer.
189280	190280	And not great.
190280	193240	It's a bummer, because I actually like the quality of the shirts on the store we were
193240	198920	at before, before everything went 180 over there, so it's unfortunate.
199360	205200	Also, well, I use StreamElements when I stream, and I might check out their merch store.
205200	208320	I'm looking around for reviews and stuff like that, so we'll see.
208320	209760	Well, hey, you know what-
209760	211200	Oh, we use StreamLabs, that's right.
211200	217200	Once in a while, we get spammed with t-shirt stores, and usually I just kind of let them go,
217200	219280	because I'm like, eh, they email all the podcasts.
219280	220400	But you know what?
220400	228320	If you want t-shirt shops, if you spam us this week and use the secret word ... What's
228360	229400	the secret word?
229400	234280	The secret word is rainbow, okay?
234280	234920	If you use the secret-
234920	235800	I don't know.
238680	244040	If you use the secret word rainbow in your email, then I'll know it's not a spam email.
244040	249880	So if you have a t-shirt store offer, send that over.
249880	250360	All right.
250360	252360	Oh, Jason suggested cookies.
252360	254920	Okay, rainbow cookies, then I'll read every word.
256040	257800	I just found something terrible out.
258320	258720	What's that?
259600	264560	That game that you were talking about on Bobby's show is on Mac.
265200	267200	Oh, I'm going to be talking about it here tonight in a minute.
267200	268720	Stay tuned for our gaming weeks.
268720	277040	But first, let's get into the kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with a game that's
277040	280160	coming out soon that I think a lot of people are looking forward to.
280160	286880	I know I am, and it's Splatoon 3, and there was a direct for Splatoon 3 this week, and
286880	291200	kind of culminated with the announcement of a Splatfest world premiere multiplayer
291200	293120	demo on August 27th.
293840	296640	There was a 30-minute Splatoon 3 direct video presentation.
296640	297680	I'm going to be honest.
297680	299120	I did not watch the whole thing.
299120	302640	I skimmed it because those things come out too early in the day for me to watch the whole
302640	302800	thing.
302800	303760	I have to work and stuff.
305120	309440	But I took a look at the highlights, and they kind of went over like, these are the
309440	311360	characters that are going to be in the story.
311360	313200	This is what the turf war is all about.
313200	314640	Salmon Run is coming back.
314640	316240	Here's some new stages.
316240	321760	But what I thought was interesting is that this new Splatfests are going to be three.
322480	326640	So you know how everything before was two.
326640	330880	It was like, Ketchup and Mayonnaise was one of them.
330880	334000	Well, as if there was any question which team I was on with that.
334960	336320	The Ketchup and Mayonnaise was one of them.
336320	337360	Oh, I'm trying to think of some of the other...
338240	341600	Did they ever do over the roll or under the roll?
341600	343520	I don't know if Splatoon ever did that.
343520	345680	No, because they know that there's only one answer to that.
347200	348480	There is no debate.
348480	351680	But that or it's a hot dog, a sandwich.
351680	355440	You know, those are the types of things that they would do in...
356240	360480	Oh, Dark Tetsuya says that over under was actually a UK one, he thinks.
360480	363920	I wouldn't be surprised, but it would be too controversial here.
363920	369520	But anyway, the big twist is now they're three choices.
369520	372720	So they're three teams because it's Splatoon 3, right?
372720	379360	So the preview Splatfest is going to be Team Rock, Paper or Scissors.
380320	381200	That's a hard one.
381840	385360	I'm thinking I'm going to go with Team Scissors because, you know, we'll cut you.
386400	386960	But I don't know.
386960	391920	I could also see like Team Paper is going to write a bunch of shit about you.
391920	394400	Team Rock, Rocks.
398000	398720	I don't know.
399840	401680	They're going to throw themselves at you.
401680	406560	But Team Rock doesn't live in a glass house.
406560	409120	You know, I don't know like what types of things.
409120	412000	But, you know, people are going to get creative with those little banners that they're going
412000	413360	to draw and that's the whole thing.
413360	418880	But I thought that that meant, oh, then that means all these PVPs are going to be like
418880	420400	three team maps now.
420400	424880	That would be really cool because like Final Fantasy XIV's PVP has some of that and it
424880	426560	lets you do some different stuff.
426560	429840	But it's not really like that.
430640	435840	So what happens is that in the first half of the Splatfest, it's still 4v4 turf war
435840	442080	battles, but the second half now that's a tricolor turf war and the three teams all
442080	443680	fight at the same time.
443680	450560	But the first place team does a four in the center and the second and third place team
450560	454480	do two and two in a pincher attack.
454480	457120	So that's kind of interesting.
457120	459200	So there is like tricolor matches.
459200	463840	And I actually think that's kind of an interesting little twist on the formula is just why does
463840	464960	it have to be just two teams?
464960	466880	Why not three teams full of color?
466880	468400	So I think that's going to be very interesting.
468400	472640	That alone made me very interested in like, OK, that's kind of a very simple, but like
472640	474560	it's going to it's going to lead to some new things.
475200	478480	So, yeah, I'm excited to see kind of where that goes.
480240	482720	They also are talking about new weapons.
482720	488000	So there's a new bow, the tri stringer that can fire in three directions at once.
488720	490320	There's a splatana wiper.
490960	497120	So like not a katana, but a splatana where you throw ink basically by swinging the katana.
497120	498160	Look, it's a video game.
498160	500800	Don't try to put like actual physics and logic into it.
500800	501440	It's how it works.
502560	508400	And special weapons that you get after inking enough turf, including the tecta cooler where
508400	511280	a fridge appears with stat boosting beverages.
511280	512080	That's kind of fun.
512080	516400	And I'm surprised they didn't try to do like a tie in with an actual drink there, a wave
516400	518480	breaker for waves and so on and so on.
519280	520960	It just sounds like it's going to be really neat.
521600	522720	The lobby's back.
522720	525120	Your friends appear as 3D holograms.
525120	529200	You can join us an alley or drop out as an opponent.
529200	530720	You know, whatever you need to do there.
531600	532880	So it's just it's neat.
532880	534080	And there's new amiibo coming.
534880	540240	The yellow inkling, the blue octoling and a small fry will be there for fifteen ninety
540240	541200	nine each.
541200	545200	And if you scan the amiibo, you get to save gear combinations.
545200	549360	And some amiibo, of course, have exclusive gear because they've got to convince you to
549360	550800	keep buying all that stuff somehow.
551440	552800	Also, one more thing.
552800	558400	I mean, it was a 30 minute presentation after all at PAX West, which used to be PAX Prime,
558400	561920	but now it's just PAX West because, you know, there's PAX East, PAX South.
561920	568560	So PAX West on September 5th, the top players from the Splatoon 2 Inkopolis showdown will
568560	573680	go to Seattle to complete in the first ever Splatoon 3 Invitational.
573680	580160	I think that's kind of interesting because it just shows, again, Nintendo kind of just
580160	584960	slithering a little more into that e-sports realm that I feel in part they've been very
584960	586720	resistant to for a long time.
586720	590480	But then, of course, we heard the news about what's that company, Panda, that they started
590480	595680	teaming up with for the Super Smash Brothers official tournaments and all that stuff.
595680	599680	So it's just it's just interesting to see Nintendo start to kind of go down that road
599680	603680	a little more, even though they really should have got on board with e-sports some time
603680	604000	ago.
604000	606560	But, you know, better late than pregnant, I guess.
606560	608400	So there's that.
609760	612560	So I got that one.
612560	613200	Dark Soccer.
613200	614320	Just Dark Soccer.
614320	616880	I count on you to always catch a Golden Girls reference.
618240	619040	All right.
619040	621360	Anyway, Loki, what did you think?
621360	625360	Jamie, I don't know if you have thoughts, but either thoughts on Splatoon 3?
626960	627760	I didn't watch it.
628080	630640	I didn't play the second one.
630640	633280	Like, I didn't really play the second one too much.
633280	636640	I remember getting it, but like, I don't think I ever played it.
637360	638240	Well, the weird.
638240	640560	OK, so what was funny, I will say this.
641440	645600	When I was at Target the other day, I was talking to Alan about Splatoon 3.
645600	648320	I was like, oh, yeah, Splatoon 3 is like the next big release on the Switch.
648320	649040	It's coming.
649040	650160	And he cracked a joke.
650160	654000	He said, oh, is that another one for them to support for six months before they pull
654000	654960	the plug on it?
654960	657680	And I was like, oh, wig.
657680	663120	OK, like, we're here to read today because that is kind of what happened with Splatoon
663120	669520	2 is that it wasn't supported quite as long as you would have thought, especially when
669520	672480	you put it side by side with Mario Kart 8 right now.
672480	679280	OK, so now granted, you know, the team went on to make Splatoon 3 and maybe they're just,
679280	681680	you know, making the fully realized game there.
681680	686720	But it is a decent read that like Splatoon 2 kind of came and went as far as the support
686720	687220	goes.
688000	692880	And Mike Dev said Splatoon 2 had two years of support, if I recall correctly.
692880	693440	Fair enough.
693440	697280	But it didn't seem like it was as long as number one, that's for sure.
697280	697680	I don't know.
697680	700400	It seemed like those flat fests didn't hang out quite as long.
700400	703760	But, you know, perception is everything, whether it's the truth or not.
703760	704000	Right.
704000	706000	That's how it goes in the video game industry.
706000	707440	So, yeah.
707440	709280	I'll be perfectly honest right now.
709280	711200	Dead by Daylight takes enough of my time.
712480	718240	Well, you know, and that's for any kind of online multiplayer versus situation.
718240	725680	Well, and that's like the ever going conundrum in gaming right now in general is that games
725680	730560	as a service, which I would say in some ways Dead by Daylight is, because the constant
730560	735360	DLC support, the constant patches, the battle passes, it's games as a service, right?
735360	735600	Yeah.
735600	739840	Never say behavior hasn't kept up with their product.
739840	745680	But you could throw into that same bin things like Overwatch, Fortnite, Call of Duty, hell,
745680	748160	anything with a battle pass really fits in that system.
748160	753680	But because we invest so much time now in these games as a service, and I would say
753680	759040	I'm just as guilty, not just Dead by Daylight, but like Final Fantasy 14, MMOs, the original
759040	760720	game as a service, right?
760720	765920	Like those games take so much of our time, that's what allows our backlogs to build up
765920	770400	because we're so focused on staying on the cutting edge of, you know, whatever's being
770400	775840	released in the battle pass and whatever our number one, our main game is.
775840	779040	So it's just interesting.
779040	785840	I feel like maybe it's Dead by Daylight for you, but a lot of people have this problem
785840	787760	with some game out there.
787760	790000	For Loki, it's Minecraft, you know?
790560	793600	For me, it's Final Fantasy and a little bit of everything.
793600	798320	So, and Bobby Blackwolf says, yeah, that's one of the reasons I did let my Final Fantasy
798320	799840	14 sub lapse.
799840	802800	And yeah, I have to force myself to play other games sometimes.
803440	807600	Luckily, 14 is in a bit of a content lull right now because we're between patches.
808640	812080	And the 14 team does a very good job staying on top of patches.
812080	814400	So like they're not as bad as, wow.
814400	818720	But, you know, we're still about two weeks out from the next Final Fantasy 14 patch.
818720	822240	So I still have a good two weeks to get in, you know, a bunch of other games.
822240	827920	But once that Final Fantasy 14 patch comes out, that's going to take over my gaming week
827920	831040	for at least a month while I explore everything in that patch.
831040	837760	And with that island sanctuary coming, they're putting like farm simulator into, I don't
837760	841680	know if it's Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon.
841680	844880	I don't know which one of those they're going for in Final Fantasy, but they're putting
844880	846400	one of those in that game.
846400	849200	And that's going to be a time sink for sure.
849200	850560	It's all of them.
850560	854320	Yeah, so let's see.
854320	859520	And Mike Deft bring in the receipts saying Splatoon, excuse me, Nintendo released Splatoon
859520	864480	2's final significant update version 5.0 in July 2019.
864480	868640	The update signaled the end of the game's post launch support, which continued for two
868640	871040	years since the Switch shooters initial release.
871040	875040	Well, I guess it did get longer support than most EA games.
875040	876880	So let's give them a round of applause for that.
876880	878080	You know, at least there is that.
878080	886560	But again, it's still hard to look at Splatoon 2 next to like Mario Kart 8 or hell, what's
886560	889520	another game that got DLC out of nowhere?
889520	893440	There was a game not long ago that Nintendo just put out new DLC out of nowhere and it
893440	894240	was like, what?
894880	897760	Like they're doing this game again for some reason?
897760	898880	Okay, cool.
898880	899600	Like it just came out.
899600	900960	I think it was Mario Kart 8.
900960	901600	Was it Mario?
901600	905120	I guess I thought there was another one that they did not that long ago where I was like,
905120	906000	all right, cool.
906000	908640	They decided to do something new for this game.
908640	911040	And so maybe it was Mario Strikers.
911040	911520	I don't know.
911520	916240	But yeah, it was Mario Party because of the online content.
916240	920240	They just suddenly one day were like, oh yeah, we're just going to patch in online play that
920240	921360	everybody's been wanting.
921360	922720	Like it was Mario Party.
922720	923360	That's what I was thinking.
923360	925600	Guys, we figured out what online was now.
925600	928080	So, you know, one of our interns helped us out with that.
928080	930240	Now we decided to go ahead and put it in the game.
931040	935520	Anyway, I did not mean to talk down on Splatoon 2.
935520	938640	I feel like I've ruffled the feathers of the Splatoon fans in chat.
938640	942960	That's not what I was trying to do, but I'm excited for Splatoon 3.
942960	943680	I am.
943680	950000	I think I like it more than a lot of shooter games, to be honest, because I like the twist
950000	954720	on the fact that it's not like, you know, trying to get headshots necessarily.
954720	959600	I mean, I guess you can, but it's more about like the paint and the strategy of, you know,
959600	963840	even if I don't necessarily want to go right after people, what is the best way for me
963840	967200	to use my paint supply to have an impact on the team?
967200	969280	You know, there's, there's, there's a different way to think about it.
969280	970400	And I kind of, I kind of like that.
970400	973840	And the whole like swimming is kind of a neat mechanic too.
973840	978000	I just, there, there's, there's unique things that Splatoon brings to the table where I
978000	979600	think it's really unfair to look at it.
979600	981120	It's just, oh, it's a kid shooter.
982080	984000	I think it has more depth than that.
984080	988480	So, Phil of Nine in chat says, do not come for Splatoon, Rob.
988480	991360	I've got my roller and my splat gun aimed at your booty.
992880	993920	That's okay.
996880	999760	SSJ 100 Matt in chat says, we can all agree.
999760	1004320	They're supporting all of these better than F-Zero right now as an actually releasing
1004320	1004800	something.
1006000	1007600	That hurt, but thank you.
1008720	1009040	Ow.
1009680	1010720	The truth hurts sometimes.
1010720	1011920	The truth hurts.
1011920	1012640	The truth hurts.
1012640	1014960	We always hurt the ones we love.
1014960	1015460	Right.
1016000	1017840	Let's get into speaking of the things we love.
1017840	1023120	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and probably those games as a service that has held our
1023120	1024320	attention this week.
1024320	1025600	Let's go with Dark Sakura.
1025600	1026400	How was your gaming week?
1028000	1032320	Well, I mentioned earlier, I started a Final Fantasy IV.
1032320	1038880	I'm actually playing a translated copy, which I am entitled to do so because I own both
1038880	1041040	the Japanese and the English versions.
1043120	1045120	So I started with that.
1045120	1052240	I forgot, though, like the difference in graphics between that one and six, even with five.
1053440	1058960	So when I'm done with Final Fantasy IV, I will be moving on to Final Fantasy V so I
1058960	1059840	can play as Butts.
1060480	1061440	His name is Butts.
1062720	1063680	Or Bartz.
1063680	1064560	I always say Butts.
1065840	1068960	Wasn't the unofficial translation Butts, so that's what most of us know.
1068960	1070800	But it was supposed to be Bartz.
1070800	1071760	Yeah, yeah, it's not like that.
1072720	1074560	Which now makes me think of Berserk.
1075600	1076800	But no, that was Gatsu.
1076800	1077280	Never mind.
1077280	1083360	Batsu is from Project Justice, our rival schools.
1084000	1085840	Same, same, same series.
1087360	1090640	I played a little bit more of Hooked on You.
1092320	1093360	It's cute.
1093360	1094080	I enjoy it.
1095280	1096960	I just bought that Lamb game.
1097840	1099600	I'm mad now.
1100560	1101760	Why are you mad?
1102560	1106240	Because I paid money for the full version.
1106240	1108560	Would you say you've joined a cult?
1110160	1110660	Never.
1111840	1112340	Never.
1112880	1113680	A gaming cult?
1113680	1114880	I'm investigating a cult.
1117200	1121840	She's starting a cult investigation podcast and she needs to be on the front lines.
1123680	1126960	It's called What the Fuck Is This Game After All?
1127600	1131440	I can't believe that there's a game called Max Gentlemen's Sexy Business, by the way.
1131440	1132320	I just think that's funny.
1132320	1133200	There's a lot of games.
1133200	1137680	Somebody was just saying in our Discord before the show over at vog network dot com slash
1137680	1138160	Discord.
1138160	1139440	Oh, I can't bring it up.
1139440	1142400	But because it'll make my co-host faces disappear.
1142400	1145440	But it was something about like, like a furry fighter.
1145440	1146320	So there's something really.
1148080	1150560	It sounded interesting.
1151200	1152160	Now I got to look it up.
1152160	1153200	It's going to bother me if I.
1154000	1159680	Corky in chat said over Discord at vog network dot com slash Discord said, I can't believe
1159680	1161680	you missed this in the new releases last week.
1161680	1163760	Linking to furry sex poker.
1163760	1164320	That was it.
1165200	1166800	And I'm like, you know what?
1166800	1170080	Not every Steam game makes our release date calendar.
1170080	1171840	And sometimes that's a blessing.
1172960	1177760	Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I just don't think that's something we
1177760	1180720	need to get into in this fine family program that we have.
1180800	1183520	There's also just like too many Steam games, honestly.
1183520	1186080	And they're all furry sex a little bit, aren't they?
1186640	1187520	There's a lot of them.
1188160	1189280	It's not anything new.
1190880	1191280	It's true.
1191840	1193600	Furry sex is not a new concept.
1193600	1195680	Anyway, moving on.
1195680	1202640	Well, anyway, there's also another game coming out that I super want called Vikings on Trampolines.
1204000	1208320	And I'm really hoping that they do a Mac version.
1208320	1211040	I actually left them some feedback hoping so.
1212000	1213760	I also did some experimentation.
1213760	1218000	So I'm not sure if you're familiar with an app called Crossover.
1220240	1229440	But Crossover is a thing to play PC applications in general.
1229440	1232480	Not play, but use PC applications on Mac OS.
1232480	1235520	And they finally have the M1 update in there.
1236080	1238080	So I installed Steam through that.
1238080	1242880	And then I tried to do VHS, and it wouldn't run it.
1243760	1247360	And so I tried to do Dead by Daylight, and it started to run it.
1247360	1248960	It actually got past the anti-cheat.
1248960	1251120	And then it was like, API error.
1251120	1258080	But I'm like, so I'm kind of back to square one with some of my stuff.
1258080	1259760	I need a good graphics card.
1262080	1264560	So there's that experimentation.
1265280	1267360	Do you want the graphics card for my old PC?
1269040	1271040	Um, sure.
1271040	1272560	How old is it?
1272560	1274400	Um, five-ish years.
1274960	1275840	Yeah, that could work.
1275840	1277600	I mean, it's good enough to run Dead by Daylight.
1277600	1279840	Yeah, I played Dead by Daylight on the old machine.
1279840	1282400	I mean, it wasn't the best ever, but it worked.
1283440	1285600	Sure, certainly worth giving a shot.
1285600	1288080	That means then the only other thing that I'll need is
1289120	1291120	I'll just have to get a new KVM switch
1291120	1293760	so I can use my monitor and all my accessories.
1294480	1296080	Yeah, I'd appreciate that.
1296080	1296480	Thank you.
1296480	1297280	Yeah, sure, why not?
1298720	1307680	Um, but, um, um, I am, I, and by the way, I have used GeForce.
1307680	1311040	I much prefer Stadia for my streaming stuff.
1311600	1317520	I used, the extent of me using GeForce was, I played a couple of things,
1317520	1323440	but, um, mostly now it's just enough to load up my PC copy of Dead by Daylight
1324080	1329360	so that I can log in and make sure that it's properly linked to my behavior account.
1330160	1336880	Um, like my Stadia one is because, uh, those two have, uh, cross progression.
1338160	1345200	So all of the, um, the many, many cosmetics I've bought and all of my achievements will
1345200	1346800	carry over between both versions.
1349440	1352720	Um, I have, I signed up for Luna.
1353040	1357440	I actually was in the beta for Luna and it's all right.
1357440	1361520	Um, but I don't recall Dead by Daylight being on there.
1362240	1362800	I don't think it is.
1362800	1364720	I don't think VHS is either.
1364720	1366320	There's really nothing on there right now.
1366320	1367920	I'm, I'm super interested in playing.
1369360	1374800	Um, but, uh, as far as other things, I did beat Final Fantasy six earlier in the week.
1376160	1376560	Yay.
1376560	1377040	Congrats.
1377840	1383120	And of course, uh, the only thing I did not do that I wish I had done was, you know, put
1383120	1388240	the effort into giving Sid Goodfish so that he would live, but whatever.
1389040	1394240	Um, and, uh, I played my word game.
1394240	1396880	I'm like almost to like level 10,000.
1398160	1399840	I'm not even kidding.
1399840	1400960	I play that game a lot.
1401760	1404640	Um, and then I did like some words on stream with people.
1404640	1405840	I think that counts as a game.
1405840	1410880	Cause that game is kind of fun, but I don't play it against most people because not to
1410880	1413040	toot my own horn, but I'm really fucking good at it.
1414400	1417920	And I want to be fair to other people.
1418880	1422320	I don't want to monopolize all the points because I'm a word nerd.
1422320	1426320	Well, I do like that we're playing a Scrabble against Bobby.
1426320	1430160	I do like the words on stream has like a cool down.
1430160	1433040	Like you can only get one word every so many seconds.
1433040	1435200	So it's, it's hard to monopolize things.
1435760	1438560	When the majority of people are misspelling simple words.
1438560	1439040	Oh yeah.
1439040	1440640	Then, you know, well that's, yeah.
1440640	1442080	Got to look for those red underlines.
1443440	1443760	Yeah.
1443760	1448320	Well, I mean, I don't know that they even care or see them, but it is what it is.
1450320	1453760	But anyway, that that's been most of my gaming.
1453760	1454240	Oh yeah.
1454240	1458560	And I did play, uh, some doctor who, and I played some world cup soccer.
1459920	1460160	All right.
1460320	1465520	For the record, the, the, uh, the clothing site is fourth wall.
1465520	1466400	Elsie just told me.
1466960	1467440	Oh, okay.
1468560	1470000	Well, I'll look into it.
1470000	1472160	Um, or you look into it and tell me how it is.
1473520	1473840	All right.
1473840	1475600	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1476560	1478320	It's all Minecraft again.
1478320	1479920	That's, that's what I've been playing.
1479920	1485200	So put out a new episode, uh, earlier this week and just been kind of figuring out what
1485200	1485700	I want to do.
1486640	1488160	It's the typical cycle.
1488800	1489520	All right.
1489520	1490000	Fair enough.
1490160	1493680	What about the game plan behind you tonight on stream as we, uh, I don't think I've said
1493680	1498080	the typical plug yet as we do tape live every Sunday night, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock
1498080	1501440	Pacific at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
1501440	1504800	That's VOG network right after the Bobby black will show.
1505360	1510320	Who was talking about an amazing book series about, I I'm not going to get into the whole
1510320	1514160	thing or repeat the whole story, but it was like basically like learning to program basic
1514160	1517600	by like participating in a second person book series.
1517600	1521440	And you became like, it was really fascinating to me and I'm like, I wanted those books and
1521440	1521920	I was a kid.
1521920	1522560	Where were those?
1522560	1525200	Anyway, go, go listen to Bobby if you want to hear more about that.
1525920	1528720	Um, but what's the game plan behind you looking.
1528720	1530720	So it's a game called writing fights.
1531280	1535920	Um, no particular reason other than I saw it when I was looking for long plays of stuff
1535920	1537280	and it looked weird.
1537280	1541200	It's like, you know how every single one of those fighting games or not really fighting
1541200	1544960	is beat them up games had that level where you're on like a hoverboard or something like
1544960	1545200	that.
1545200	1549840	It was, it was like, Oh, you're on a hoverboard, but it really, it's just the same gameplay
1549840	1550160	again.
1550160	1551840	It's the mode seven level.
1551840	1555600	There's always going to be a mode seven level in any like super Nintendo game.
1555600	1556080	Exactly.
1556080	1560240	So this entire game is basically that, but what's funny though is like, you're actually,
1560240	1563920	you can like fight, um, cars and stuff like that.
1563920	1564960	It's just ridiculous.
1565520	1566080	Okay.
1566080	1566880	It looked weird.
1566880	1567280	Good times.
1567280	1568240	Oh, I picked it.
1568960	1569280	All right.
1569280	1570960	Uh, let's see my gaming week.
1570960	1572000	So, um, okay.
1572000	1574240	So I, I've been teasing it enough.
1574240	1576640	I also played cult of the lamb for the first time.
1576640	1580400	I had to play something new this week because I was going to be coming into this show again,
1580400	1582560	going, I played some more dead by daylight.
1582560	1584400	I played some more Final Fantasy 14.
1584400	1587920	I play all the same shit I always play, but I was like, all right, I want to play something
1587920	1588240	new.
1588240	1594000	So I checked out this cult of the lamb game because I had heard the talk about, Oh, it's
1594000	1599280	like animal crossing, but instead of animal crossing cute characters, you're trying to
1599280	1600720	get them all to join a cult.
1600720	1604880	And if they like try to disobey you, you kill them and you bury them in the back of
1604880	1606880	the compound.
1606880	1607200	No.
1607200	1607680	Well, okay.
1607680	1608880	So here's the thing.
1608880	1615120	I think that headline about the, um, animal crossing ask element of it that came from
1615120	1618640	a Kotaku article getting my hands on the game.
1618640	1621360	I actually don't think it's really, it's, it's like animal crossing.
1621360	1624800	The only thing it has in common with animal crossing is this cute animal characters.
1624800	1625440	I think that's it.
1625440	1625680	Yeah.
1625680	1626000	Yeah.
1626000	1630320	The game itself feels a little more like the binding of Isaac.
1630320	1635920	I think would be a good comparison for the, um, rogue like element meets don't starve
1635920	1639040	for the crafting element and kind of building the village area.
1639040	1642720	And that's the part that I think people are comparing a little bit to animal crossing,
1642720	1646320	but I'm like, I feel like animal crossing.
1646320	1650800	No, like it's just, I don't know how to explain it, but it's just a totally different vibe
1650800	1651840	in animal crossing.
1651840	1657200	Uh, this game, obviously the whole like cute characters joining a cult.
1657200	1662240	I mean, it's, it's, it's selling the game on concept really.
1662240	1667520	Cause I'm going to be honest, like the, the rogue like park part and the city building
1667520	1672240	part are not particularly novel games, either one of them.
1672240	1675120	They're not doing anything the genre hasn't seen before.
1675760	1678720	It's just the way they're doing it and the way they're implementing it.
1678720	1684720	And I will say, I think one of the smartest big brain things the developers did, and I'm
1684720	1687520	not saying, by the way, I want to make this very clear.
1687520	1689440	I'm not saying that makes it a bad game.
1690480	1691760	No, of course not.
1691760	1694000	Like comfort food is comfort food.
1694000	1698000	Sometimes relying on these old tricks and old genres is a great thing.
1698560	1702480	I think the big brain stuff these developers did were all the Twitch integrations that
1702480	1707200	they did, which if I'm not mistaken, allow the followers to be people that are watching
1707200	1707840	your channel.
1708560	1710960	It's it's simple, but it's brilliant.
1710960	1714560	It's fucking brilliant because I'll tell you, I'm looking at my Twitch list right
1714560	1714960	now.
1714960	1716560	There's three people streaming that game.
1717120	1721360	Nobody knew about this game two weeks ago, and now it's becoming the hot, the hot new
1722080	1723440	must have on Twitch.
1723440	1726960	I know it's getting through the Dead by Daylight community.
1726960	1731120	Cause that has to be how Dark Sakura saw it on Twitch and got convinced to buy it once
1731120	1732560	she saw it ran on her system.
1732560	1733120	I don't know.
1733120	1734800	That's or was it something else?
1736800	1738720	It was literally you mentioning it.
1738720	1740880	Oh, my impact.
1740880	1741280	Thank you.
1741280	1744960	Well, I saw that it runs on Mac.
1744960	1746320	I was like, okay, I'll do it.
1746320	1749840	I'm supporting more companies that are doing content for Mac.
1749840	1750400	Fair.
1750400	1754800	I did see Isaaco streaming it last night, so I figured maybe he's seen them streaming
1754800	1755200	it or something.
1755200	1756960	I know there's been other DVD streamers have played.
1756960	1763040	I started playing at 8 30 and stopped streaming at two in the morning, which for me is unheard
1763040	1763520	of.
1763520	1764240	That's pretty late.
1765280	1765760	Yeah.
1766160	1768960	And by the time I went to bed, I just super passed out.
1768960	1773760	And like, if not for Dan waking me up, I probably would have kept sleeping.
1773760	1774260	Yeah.
1775520	1775840	Let's see.
1775840	1779120	Fifth Dream in chat says one of my animals asked me if he could eat some poop.
1779120	1781040	So I cooked him a bowl of poop and he ate it.
1781040	1781760	Quest complete.
1782320	1786400	It's those types of the face Dark Sakura just made.
1786960	1787520	I'm sorry.
1788080	1788320	Sorry.
1788320	1790720	I had to explain that for the podcast, folks.
1790720	1792560	But yeah, yeah, I guess that is something.
1793120	1798960	Well, but I guess, you know, cleaning up your cult members poop is part of the game.
1798960	1803040	And that's I didn't know you could feed it back to them.
1803040	1803360	That's.
1803360	1805360	Well, many animals eat their own crap.
1805360	1806400	I guess so.
1807280	1807680	All right.
1807680	1811520	There's a lot of people who will eat their own crap.
1811520	1813360	And I mean that metaphorically.
1813360	1818560	But it's wild shit like that, literally, which is why everybody's talking about this game
1818560	1825040	right now, because again, the the the game element of the game is is for all intents
1825040	1827920	and purposes, a tired formula at this point.
1827920	1831200	It's like a roguelike and a sim game.
1831200	1834080	What a tired fucking formula format at this point.
1835520	1841840	But this game pulls it off because it says, well, what if we do something really sick
1841840	1842880	and twisted with it?
1844240	1844740	Yes.
1845360	1846080	That's it.
1846080	1847360	That's that's the guy.
1847440	1849680	Any original ideas anymore?
1849680	1852160	Just original executions.
1852160	1852400	Yeah.
1852400	1853760	And that and that's what it is.
1853760	1854960	It's the execution.
1854960	1859440	It's the building in that Twitch integration from the because I believe this game is still
1859440	1860560	early access.
1860560	1863360	So it's literally Twitch integration at the ground level.
1863360	1868080	And I saw it was called out in chat that the Twitch stuff is still buggy.
1868080	1869120	Of course it is.
1869120	1873520	But it doesn't matter that type of stuff, especially like, you know, being able to have
1873600	1880240	your viewers be in your village and cooking dishes for them and all that stuff like that
1880240	1880960	is funny.
1880960	1884960	And that is, you know, that is building community one way or another.
1884960	1888960	So it's it's just like the execution of it.
1888960	1890480	I think it's a very good way to put it.
1891360	1897120	The genre tired, been done better before the execution, a plus.
1897760	1899200	That's that's where they've nailed it.
1899200	1899840	That's what it is.
1900400	1902720	So that was my thoughts on Cult of the Lamb.
1903440	1908160	The only other new ish thing I did this week, so Loki to follow up on your stories from
1908160	1913360	last week, I went to round one locally on Friday, so I got to see the new round one.
1914800	1916160	It was it was OK.
1916160	1920720	But also, I think because you said this to the BeatMania 2DX machines, one of them was
1920720	1922880	broken and it was in pieces.
1922880	1927360	Like literally they're they're trying to it looked like to me that they're trying to
1927360	1933360	replace the because it has the old school levers on it and the other machine has the
1933360	1938720	actual touch pad that the newer 2DX machines have for all the equalizer and all the additional
1938720	1939520	functionality.
1939520	1943120	It looked to me like they're trying to switch the old one to one of those or something.
1943120	1946400	But it just maybe it surprised me that it was so broken the first week.
1947280	1951600	Otherwise, like I'm just my back was super hurting and I don't know why I must have pulled
1951600	1953120	a muscle in it on Friday or something.
1953120	1957440	So like there was no way I really wanted to play DDR and take a picture and send it to
1957440	1958000	YYR.
1958000	1960240	But the way my back was feeling, that was not going to happen.
1960240	1963520	And there was too many people around where I didn't even want to play the easy stuff.
1963520	1968000	But I did play some BeatMania 2DX and Shane was making fun of me because I was playing
1968000	1970320	Boomer songs in 2DX, but I don't care.
1970320	1974080	I'm yes, I am going to play Burning Heat from 7th style.
1974080	1979920	And I think I think I played Rizlim from 5th style or 4th style like I was playing old
1979920	1980400	shit.
1980400	1981280	And yes, I love.
1981280	1984640	But the problem is my skill level has regressed completely.
1984640	1985680	Like I failed.
1986560	1987840	I did In My Eyes.
1987840	1988720	You remember that song?
1989920	1993040	In my eyes.
1993040	1997680	So I have some complicated note patterns, but that song used to be like easy.
1997680	1998640	I failed it.
1999280	2003680	I was like, OMG, this is sad, but it's just going to take practice.
2004240	2006720	Otherwise, the round one itself was fine.
2006720	2010320	I didn't love how they had all the music games shoved in one corner.
2010320	2017120	It also felt like there wasn't as much like the games were tightly packed in.
2017120	2021120	There wasn't as much space to move around the games as there is in other round ones
2021120	2021760	that I've been to.
2021760	2025440	That was the other weird thing for me is I was like, dang, this place is like packed
2025440	2026880	in tight here.
2028000	2033360	But I mean, I guess like, can you fault an arcade for wanting to maximize the real estate
2033360	2034080	that they have?
2034080	2035200	I don't think I can.
2036800	2041440	But yeah, and when you kind of look at like what music games they have side by side with
2041440	2043760	any other round one, it's pretty comparable.
2043760	2047600	I mean, yeah, I noticed Dance Rush was missing, but they had two of those other ones.
2047600	2050000	Was that a Hatsune Miku dance game or something?
2050000	2050640	I don't know.
2050640	2053120	Dance Around is what it's called.
2053120	2053920	I don't know.
2053920	2054720	It looks stupid.
2055440	2057360	Oh, yeah, they did have the Hatsune Miku.
2057360	2061200	I don't know that one was either, but that almost looked like sort of like Para Para,
2061200	2061680	but not.
2062240	2062720	I don't know.
2062720	2064960	I just looked over and I swear I saw Hatsune Miku in it.
2065680	2071440	Yeah, so they have like two of those two, but they had two of the dance arounds, which
2071440	2077760	looks like like an evolution of dance evolution that they put out the one that's like sort
2077760	2087200	of kind of, you know, actually what it reminds me of now that I think of it, it's a little
2087200	2094080	bit like just dance almost like they have it where you have to strike a certain pose
2094640	2095600	that's what it looks like.
2096160	2101520	Yeah, it looks like it's like a just dance or I don't remember a dance evolution too
2101520	2101760	much.
2101760	2106000	So I don't remember if it was like that because I remember that game was like similar to Para
2106000	2108080	and they had like Para songs in it.
2108080	2111680	But no, I had no interest in playing dance around.
2111680	2113120	And there's two of them.
2113120	2113760	I liked that.
2115040	2117520	What was that circle cross or something?
2117520	2120640	The cross circle, the giant circle.
2120640	2126960	It looked like it looked like it was a sequel to cross beats because you tap on the screen
2126960	2128880	and you spin this circle with the giant button.
2128880	2129760	Yeah, Chrono circle.
2129760	2130080	That's it.
2130080	2131200	Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.
2131200	2132320	That one looked really cool.
2132320	2135120	I didn't have a chance, but it was actually really crowded when we went.
2135120	2138480	So the arcades doing well for what it's worth.
2138480	2143440	So as Joe and Hunter Matt says, did you play any of the claw games for some sweet plushes?
2143440	2146560	Round ones are the only place where I've been able to win claw games, mostly because they
2146560	2148000	give hints on how to win.
2148000	2149600	That is my husband's department.
2149600	2154720	I very rarely touch those things, but my husband, my husband will play the claw games online.
2155680	2159600	Like suddenly we'll like a big stuffed animal will show up at the door and I'm like, were
2159600	2161520	you playing those fucking claw games online again?
2161520	2163440	No, they just said this to me by accident.
2163440	2166480	No, I won a prize.
2166480	2174560	I do have to admit round one crane games are fairly easy, but nothing beats the cheap claw
2174560	2182240	game in the Walmart and Lodi where I had to get a lot of plastic bag to carry home my
2182240	2182880	plushies.
2182880	2185760	Yeah, I was going to say there was a lot of people with plushies when I went through that
2185760	2186240	one time.
2186240	2191840	They had a lot of people playing the crane games, which I'm surprised because I always
2191840	2193440	thought those are kind of a rip off.
2193440	2195920	I had to replace my amusement pass, though, which made me sad.
2195920	2200160	But I realized I lost my other one in the move, but and I'm not sure like I have mine,
2200160	2202480	but I couldn't get to work because it was asking me for a pin.
2202480	2204240	And then I used the pin that I normally use.
2204240	2205600	And I was like, it didn't work.
2205600	2207440	So I'm like, Oh, weird.
2207440	2208400	I was able to register mine.
2208400	2208640	Okay.
2208640	2210160	But I did it on the 2DX machines.
2210160	2210960	I don't know.
2210960	2216560	And they translated some of 2DX to English, but not all of it, which is weird.
2216560	2219360	Like you'll see these screens in English and you'll see some in Japanese.
2219360	2221440	And I'm like, it's kind of typical, though.
2221440	2222880	Then they did that.
2222880	2223680	Sounds like DDR.
2224800	2226000	Yeah, I guess that's true.
2226000	2228240	I just I've never seen it would be meaning a 2DX.
2228240	2229680	That's the thing that was weird to me.
2229680	2232560	So anyway, enough local arcade chat.
2232560	2234400	But it was it was the thing that I went and did.
2234400	2238080	I wasn't there very long, all things considered, because then it was like, let's go to the
2238080	2238960	cheesecake factory.
2238960	2239600	So we did.
2240320	2241840	But I was around one for a little bit.
2241840	2245440	And it was it was the I'd go again, but I'll probably go during the week when there's likely
2245440	2246560	to be less people there.
2246560	2247680	It was just very crowded.
2247680	2248880	School is starting up.
2248880	2250080	So I'm excited.
2250080	2250640	I'm excited.
2250640	2252400	Go home and do your schoolwork, kiddos.
2252400	2252640	All right.
2253920	2258960	Like allegedly, I mean, I don't know, because there's conflicting times on their website
2258960	2259920	and on the door.
2259920	2262240	The door says they're open till 2 a.m. every day.
2262800	2264960	The website says they're open till midnight every day.
2264960	2267360	Yeah, I thought they were open until midnight.
2267360	2270400	And you have to go into the parking lot entrance, not the mall entrance.
2271040	2271920	Yeah, of course.
2271920	2272960	I mean, that makes sense.
2272960	2274160	So anyway.
2274160	2274660	All right.
2275280	2276640	That's it for our gaming weeks.
2276640	2278320	Let's get into some other news.
2278320	2282240	Oh, first, housekeeping, because I haven't plugged this in a little bit here on this
2282240	2287920	show, and I'm not even sure my co-hosts will remember, but we're not going to be here in
2287920	2292400	one, two, three weeks, Labor Day weekend, as is customary for me the last 10 years,
2293040	2294160	Dragon Con weekend.
2294160	2299280	So I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con if you're in the area and you're down for conventions.
2299280	2303440	I understand everybody's got their own tolerance levels right now, and that's completely cool.
2303440	2306080	So I don't want to like say, be there or you suck.
2306080	2307120	Nope, I understand.
2307120	2308400	You got to do what's best for you.
2309760	2312560	But if you are going to be at Dragon Con in the area, come say hi.
2313280	2317760	I'm not talking about my panel schedule yet because things change right up until the last
2317760	2318000	minute.
2318000	2318720	They always do.
2319680	2322240	The app should be released this next week, I think.
2322240	2324800	And once it's released, I'll talk about my panels.
2324800	2328880	All I'm going to say this early, as usual, I have panels on digital media.
2328880	2330800	I'm always thankful that that track has me.
2330800	2331120	Thank you.
2331120	2333280	Thank you to Charles and everybody on the digital media crew.
2334000	2336080	We've got some fun panels on that this year.
2337360	2341040	Bobby submitted a new idea for VOG to lead.
2341040	2348000	And y'all are going to, when you hear who they put on that panel, you're going to be
2348000	2348960	like, what?
2349840	2351600	So we'll talk about that in a couple of weeks.
2352640	2355520	And I have some stuff on the gaming track.
2356320	2358160	Tentatively, I have a ballroom panel.
2359440	2361920	So I'll again be teasing that next week.
2361920	2365200	But that's if it's a ballroom, that means they're expecting a big crowd.
2365200	2365920	So there's that.
2366880	2371680	And then there's a third track, a mystery track that not literally the mystery track,
2371680	2372960	but I will reveal it next week.
2372960	2376720	And all I'm going to say is, if you had told me three years ago I would be working with
2376720	2378400	this track, I would have said, what?
2379600	2382560	But I'm very, very, very happy and excited about it.
2382560	2383840	So yeah.
2384880	2387200	Bobby says we both have ballroom panels this year.
2387200	2390800	If I'm not mistaken, Bobby, we have the exact same panel on different days.
2391760	2394880	Again, it's a panel where they're expecting to fill the room twice.
2396000	2397200	So I'm going to leave it at that.
2397200	2398880	It's exciting.
2400720	2404560	Jaskren in chat says, and Bobby will have the more full one.
2406000	2406720	Absolutely.
2406720	2408960	Because mine is on Monday.
2408960	2411680	And for most people, Dragon Con is over on Monday.
2411680	2413760	So but Bobby's will be more full.
2413760	2414480	But you know what?
2414480	2419440	I'm glad Bobby gets to have his moment because I had that huge Overwatch panel a couple of
2419440	2420240	years ago.
2420240	2421520	So this is going to be great for Bobby.
2421520	2422240	I'm really excited.
2422240	2423360	And I'm excited to do it too.
2424320	2426480	I'm just excited to have this opportunity.
2426480	2428560	So that's going to be in a few weeks.
2428560	2433280	So we will not be here the night of the fourth because I'll be at Dragon Con.
2434000	2436560	I imagine if DarkSakura is around, she'll be doing some streaming.
2437200	2439840	Loki will be working on the Minecraft vids and stuff.
2439840	2441040	So good stuff.
2441040	2442560	They've been talking about doing more streaming.
2443120	2445760	There's other people that I play with.
2445760	2447520	They stream a lot more than I do.
2447520	2449920	But I do want to get back into it.
2449920	2451920	I just have to find something to do.
2451920	2456560	It's probably gonna be just like, we're going down into a mine and doing all that stuff.
2456560	2457120	Maybe.
2457120	2457440	Maybe.
2458080	2459440	People still watch it.
2459440	2460480	We're talking about streamlines.
2460480	2461600	Yeah, because yeah, seriously.
2461600	2463200	Loki just played Dead by Daylight.
2463200	2464480	It's worked for the rest of us.
2464480	2465760	No, no.
2467920	2468240	All right.
2468880	2472480	Pod Culture says was going to try and do a one day visit to Dragon Con, but they aren't
2472480	2474320	selling single day passes online.
2474320	2476560	I think they were and they sold out fast.
2476560	2479440	They are not selling single day passes on site.
2479440	2481920	That is a change they made due to COVID.
2481920	2485360	Like, you know, they're trying to scale back the attendance a little bit.
2485360	2488480	And that's one way they're doing it is they're no longer selling badges at the door.
2489200	2493280	So that was a change they made to try to thin out the convention a little bit, which quite
2493280	2499600	frankly, versus like last year, it was weird because we were right in the midst of the
2499600	2501120	Delta wave and all that stuff.
2501120	2504320	But masks were required as they're required this year.
2504320	2506560	I was directly in front of somebody who had COVID.
2506560	2509280	I didn't get COVID at the con because everybody was masked up.
2509280	2510480	It was fabulous.
2510480	2518240	So but I loved last year that the convention was like only half full and it was beautiful
2518240	2522080	to be able to walk around and go wherever you needed to go without bumping into people.
2522080	2522800	So yeah.
2523760	2525680	Oh, Pod Culture says I get why.
2525680	2529040	Just by the time I found out I could swing it a day, it was too late.
2529040	2530240	I'm sorry, Pod Culture.
2530240	2530560	Sorry.
2531360	2532240	All right.
2532240	2532640	Anyhow.
2532720	2537440	Um, so let's get into some more gaming news and talk about what's going on.
2538320	2539680	We'll start with Loki.
2539680	2540800	What's in the news this week?
2541520	2547520	So, um, well, Activision wants, or I should say Activision Blizzard wants to let you know
2547520	2548560	that there's good news.
2548560	2551520	They have gotten rid of loot boxes in Overwatch 2.
2552160	2555840	And you know, when they're always giving you good news like that, that it's not really
2555840	2560400	good news, because if it was good news, they wouldn't be happy about it.
2561280	2568880	So in this case, they're replacing the loot boxes that were in the game forever with the
2568880	2570480	battle pass system that they have now.
2571200	2576400	My thought is because one, they're probably making more money off of the battle pass system,
2576400	2578160	which is why they're doing it in the first place.
2578160	2582400	And also because they can put out a press release like this and say, look, we're not,
2582400	2586000	you know, we're not making it by loot boxes.
2586000	2594640	So, um, but loot boxes themselves though, will be done with, uh, very soon, actually
2594640	2598400	in October, which I think is when, uh, Overwatch 2 is coming out.
2599280	2605600	Um, and then they said that, uh, loot boxes that players are sitting on will automatically
2605600	2607760	open before the launch of Overwatch 2.
2607760	2608720	Cause, Oh yeah, that's right.
2608720	2613360	Cause didn't they have loot boxes, but like the keys cost money is what it was.
2613360	2615920	No, you, you would get some loot boxes.
2615920	2619440	Like every time you level up, you'd get a loot box or an event loot box or something
2619440	2620240	like that.
2620240	2624800	Um, and then, um, you could also buy and get a lot of cosmetics that way, which people
2624800	2628080	would like to do during the holiday events, because it was the only way to get some of
2628080	2629840	the legendary skins or in loot boxes.
2629840	2633200	But of course we all know the controversy behind loot boxes.
2633200	2636640	So Blizzard's kind of walking away from that a little bit because they see a different
2636640	2637760	way to make money on this game.
2637760	2642400	And I think in general, people just kind of seem to like the battle pass stuff better
2642400	2643520	than the loot boxes.
2643520	2648640	This is, that's exactly what Dead by Daylight has in it is the battle pass system and it
2648640	2649360	works.
2649360	2653120	So I'm, I'm sure it's going to work fine for Overwatch as well, to be honest.
2654560	2655120	Probably.
2655120	2655680	Yeah.
2655680	2656080	Yeah.
2656080	2659440	So, um, now some folks in chat are saying there's still loot boxes.
2659440	2660400	You just can't buy it.
2660400	2667200	Does that mean you still get like a free like thing every time you level up or do like,
2667200	2670080	if you're queuing is something in need, sometimes you get a loot box.
2670080	2672160	I don't remember all the different ways you get it.
2672160	2676960	But, um, is that still all going to be available or are they sunsetting that as well in favor
2676960	2682880	of like a premium currency or something like, cause that would exactly be dead by daylight
2682880	2683360	in that case.
2684400	2689440	No, they just basically said that loot boxes will no longer be available for sale at the
2689440	2694240	after the end of anniversary remix three event on August 30th.
2694240	2700400	And then, um, you, it says, uh, earn and purchase anniversary loot boxes through the event.
2700400	2702800	So they're still doing stuff that you can earn.
2703520	2706480	Um, I guess it's just going to be for purchase.
2706480	2707760	It looks like, okay.
2708480	2712480	Since it says there will not be available for sale, but I'm sure that if they're giving
2712480	2716160	them away for free, nobody is necessarily complaining about that.
2716720	2722000	Um, that they'll probably still be doing something similar for that, but like you just can't
2722000	2722720	purchase them.
2722720	2722960	Yeah.
2722960	2727600	I see them as just walking away from this controversy at the time when their company
2727600	2730080	is surrounded in controversy anyway.
2730160	2736480	And going to something that the industry seems to have accepted a little more, um, for, for
2736480	2736880	what it is.
2736880	2740240	And I know I keep referencing dead by daylight, but that's just cause it's the game, you know,
2740240	2744640	both our soccer and I are all in on that and we play it a lot, but certainly there are
2744640	2746640	plenty of other games to do battle passes.
2746640	2748880	Like Fortnite is a huge example too.
2748880	2753280	Uh, what the call of duty even has their own battle, but like it's a very, very common
2753280	2755840	system in games now, dead by daylight.
2755840	2756960	Doesn't do a battle pass.
2758160	2759040	What would you call it?
2760080	2765440	You just buy the episodes or the DLC, but you don't have to have them to play or to
2765440	2769040	play against those killers or with those other survivors.
2769840	2774320	It's more of a pay to unlock, not necessarily like a battle pass system.
2774320	2781120	Well, if you don't, if you don't buy the pass, you can still play the game.
2781120	2784080	You just don't have access to some of the content.
2784080	2789520	That's like, well, like I'm thinking of like the rift pass or whatever is all cosmetics.
2789520	2790560	That's all it is cosmetics.
2790560	2794400	They don't like put killers or anything in there, but like in Overwatch, that's what
2794400	2794960	they're doing too.
2794960	2797440	They're not going to lock any characters in the battle pass or anything.
2797440	2799120	It's all just cosmetics.
2799120	2800960	I just, I don't think of it as a battle pass.
2803760	2804260	Yeah.
2804880	2810160	Mike Defton Chat says you need to be playing a whole lot and you get three weekly boxes
2810160	2811520	for winning nine matches.
2811520	2812720	That is a lot of matches.
2812720	2815280	It doesn't sound like a lot, but it is, especially when you have to win them.
2815520	2818560	All right.
2819440	2822880	I mean, I'll probably try the new Overwatch when it comes out.
2822880	2823520	I don't know.
2823520	2827360	Like it's just one of those add it to the backlog of things I got to play.
2827360	2827860	We'll see.
2828720	2830960	So, all right, moving on.
2830960	2835440	Let's talk about some of the news that THQ Nordic put out this week.
2835440	2839520	So they had their own little showcase that was online and some of the things that they
2839520	2841520	talked about were Alone in the Dark.
2841600	2845840	They're going to be doing a reimagining of Alone in the Dark from 1992.
2846560	2850080	We don't know a whole lot about it, but apparently it does bring over concepts
2850080	2851760	and characters from the original trilogy.
2851760	2852720	They look good.
2852720	2853220	Yeah.
2853920	2854960	But I'm not sure.
2854960	2856240	I don't think it's supposed to be a remake.
2856240	2859440	I think it's more like a relaunch or a retelling or reboot.
2859440	2860400	It's like a remake.
2860400	2865280	How Resident Evil 7 is sort of like a remake of the Resident Evil series type of thing.
2865280	2865840	Gotcha.
2865840	2868480	It's kind of like a whole different take on it.
2868480	2869040	Let's put it this way.
2869040	2873840	It looks better than the last remake of Alone in the Dark.
2873840	2876160	Now, if you want to just have a straight up remake,
2876160	2879200	then you've got Destroy All Humans 2 re-probed.
2879200	2884400	They are just remaking that for PS5, the series consoles for Xbox and PC.
2884400	2885280	So that is happening.
2886640	2890720	Space for Sale is a game that they're going to be putting out where you, you know,
2890720	2894640	I love my space games and you do get to explore planets, build properties
2894640	2897760	and ensure the inhabitants of the planets are satisfied.
2897760	2900880	So it also uses procedurally generated landscape,
2900880	2903120	like another space game I really enjoy.
2903120	2907600	But I don't think it's quite as in-depth on that front as maybe No Man's Sky.
2907600	2909440	But it does look like a cute little space game.
2910240	2911120	It'd be cool.
2911120	2915200	Speaking of remakes, Gothic, the original 90s RPG,
2915200	2917680	the original Gothic game is getting a remake.
2917680	2918480	That's kind of cool.
2919200	2922160	So that's coming out for PS5 series and PC.
2922880	2925760	Jagged Alliance 3 is on its way.
2925760	2928960	In this strategy game, you get to operate mercenaries
2928960	2931920	and you get tactical strategy shown in the trailer.
2931920	2935200	This is the first Jagged Alliance game in 14 years.
2935200	2935840	Just heads up.
2936800	2939440	The Valiant was another game that they showed during this.
2940160	2942560	Again, it's an RTS type of game.
2942560	2944800	So there's a co-op mode in this game as well.
2944800	2947280	And a second player can drop in and out, which is kind of neat.
2948240	2950400	Tempest Rising was another game.
2950400	2954160	3D Realms is a part of this, and it's a military based RTS game.
2954720	2956640	It's a post a nuclear war game.
2956640	2958640	And you pick from one of three factions.
2958640	2961040	You gather resources, et cetera, et cetera.
2961680	2963600	Don't get me excited by saying Tempest.
2964400	2965040	Yeah, sorry.
2965040	2965840	Not that Tempest.
2965840	2966340	Different one.
2967200	2968320	Knights of Honor 2.
2969840	2972720	It's a game like Age of Empires or Civilization,
2972720	2974880	but you're doing your own medieval kingdom.
2974880	2978960	You appoint marshals and clerics and you ally with other nations
2978960	2981280	and kill those that aren't cooperating with you.
2982240	2985120	Outcast 2, a new beginning.
2985120	2989120	This is a sequel to the PC game from the 90s, Outcast.
2989120	2990800	Yes, all these decades later.
2990800	2992320	Outcast 2, a new beginning.
2992880	2996080	Slated for PS5, Xbox series, and PC.
2997120	3002480	A game called Recreation, spelled W-R-E-C-K, Recreation.
3002480	3004080	It's an open world racer.
3004080	3008000	I'm assuming maybe going for a little bit of that burnout vibe,
3008000	3010640	but it has the Loki factor.
3010640	3014560	Meaning players can build their own tracks and share them with users.
3015760	3017840	And speaking of the burnout connection,
3017840	3022480	Fiona Sperry and Alex Ward, who created Burnout, are behind this game.
3022480	3024160	So it's Burnout with a track editor.
3024160	3026720	So this is the Loki game.
3027280	3028560	Who's the other one that they just...
3029280	3032000	The other Burnout type game that was...
3033440	3036720	It was just like all the Crash Mode stuff, but it was its own game.
3037680	3039280	I don't remember, but it was okay.
3039280	3040240	Yeah, digital release.
3041200	3043760	I don't remember what it's called, but I didn't play it.
3043760	3046080	But yeah, I'll check it out.
3047360	3049680	Way of the Hunter, a hunting sim.
3049680	3054320	So if you've ever actually played Deer Hunter in a Walmart arcade,
3054320	3056320	this is probably a game up your alley.
3056320	3057040	If you haven't, then probably not.
3057040	3061920	Did you see the Big Buck Hunter that they had at round one with the Terminator stuff in there?
3061920	3063280	No, I didn't see that.
3063280	3064160	It's so messed up.
3064160	3065520	I'm like, Terminator?
3065520	3066020	What?
3066020	3075700	No, I saw the gigantic dot matrix looking puzzle bobble game, though.
3075700	3077140	Oh, yeah, that looks awesome.
3077140	3078020	I want to play that.
3078020	3081620	I watched Shane and his husband play that, and it looked silly.
3081620	3085220	And then there was a giant Kinect 4 game, and I was like, this is also silly.
3085780	3089140	So yeah, lots of silly ticket munchers in that game.
3089940	3091220	Anyway, let's see.
3091220	3092180	What else do we have?
3092180	3093940	Oh, hey, wrestling fans.
3094820	3096020	We have something for you.
3096020	3098020	AEW Fight Forever.
3098740	3102100	It's a wrestling game, and it's going to be shown at Gamescom 2022.
3102900	3104660	Another game called Stuntfest.
3105460	3108820	If you like to eject from cars, Stuntfest is for you.
3109620	3113860	The driver gets to be launched in the air and bounced off obstacles before going back
3113860	3114740	in their vehicles.
3115300	3117940	All right, a closed beta starting this weekend.
3118580	3123620	And it sounds like that almost sounds like burnout a little bit.
3123620	3127620	SpongeBob SquarePants, the Cosmic Shake is also coming out.
3128580	3133220	It's coming out for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so it's lagging behind a generation,
3133220	3134980	but it is a SpongeBob SquarePants game.
3135860	3140420	And then at the very, very end, they teased a South Park game, but that's all we know.
3141380	3145860	But I would assume it's not a role playing game because that's Ubisoft's area.
3145860	3147780	So I don't care.
3147780	3148580	It'll be awesome.
3149220	3155860	So I could see why they'll do the SpongeBob stuff for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
3156820	3158660	It's the sibling consoles now.
3158660	3163940	Yeah, or you handed it down to your children's bedroom consoles.
3163940	3164500	Exactly.
3164500	3165000	Yeah.
3167540	3171860	Plus the newer stuff, even though we make fun of Sony for backwards compatibility,
3171860	3175780	sometimes the reality is PlayStation 5 will play all the PS4 games.
3175780	3179140	So it's not like you can't say SpongeBob isn't available on PS5.
3179140	3181460	It is in backwards compatibility mode.
3181460	3182260	So there's that.
3182820	3187460	So Tiger Claw says, Where would they take the third South Park game?
3187460	3189540	The first one was LARPing in a fantasy world.
3189540	3190900	The second one was superheroes.
3190900	3192580	Wouldn't this be a different genre?
3192580	3194820	Because Ubisoft made those other games.
3194820	3195860	Not Nordic, right?
3196500	3201140	Or did THG bring in another sequel to South Park 64?
3201140	3203140	The best South Park game ever made.
3203140	3204900	How about a first person shooter game?
3205380	3209700	That's what I'm thinking, because I wasn't that legit a THQ game.
3209700	3211860	South Park 64, I feel like it was.
3211860	3212580	It may have been.
3215780	3217220	That game was awful, but I loved it.
3217220	3217860	I played it.
3217860	3219220	I rented it from Blockbuster.
3219780	3221540	Yeah, I'd totally play that again.
3221540	3222040	All right.
3223540	3228660	Let's move on to a somewhat innovative new way to test some of these games potentially,
3228660	3229540	right, Dark Sakura?
3233780	3234280	You're muted.
3234900	3241300	It's also some good news for Stadia.
3243300	3248180	So Stadia has a...
3249780	3256580	They're testing a type of game trial under its click-to-play system, about a 50-50 one.
3257460	3262980	What they're doing is for two games, which is Control and Sniper Elite 4,
3263780	3271220	50% get a normal timer on the demo, and the other ones get unlimited access
3271220	3273380	until they unlock certain achievements.
3274420	3278340	So you could play and never hit those achievements,
3278340	3280580	unless it's like, you finished stage one.
3281140	3282100	Here, yay.
3282100	3283140	Have an achievement.
3283140	3283780	Oh, you're done.
3284980	3289460	But at any rate, they're doing these on a 50-50 split to examine
3289460	3293380	what effects it has on the trial length metric.
3294180	3301380	So is it going to grant a person more time on the trial?
3301380	3305620	Is it going to let the person experience more of the game and lead to a purchase?
3306260	3309140	So those are different things that they're going to look at.
3309140	3311780	So as an example, for Sniper Elite 4,
3311780	3315540	you try the game until you complete the beginning of the end achievement,
3315540	3318340	which comes at the end of the first mission, sort of like I was saying before.
3320020	3324260	Which if you don't get the first mission done, I guess in 90 minutes,
3324260	3326820	then this lets you finish the first mission.
3329700	3336740	So this means that players who can't finish the first level in that time period,
3338340	3344820	they will be able to keep trying until they do and have a more complete experience with it.
3345540	3354340	And as one of the Stadia reps said,
3354340	3358020	is that they want new players to experience the observe, plan,
3358020	3361540	execute mantra that sits behind the game, as they're saying.
3362420	3366660	So you can run and gun, but the best results come from considering your options
3366660	3368340	and planning your attack accordingly.
3368340	3372900	So they want people to be able to take their time and play it as if they own the game.
3373860	3377380	And I think that it's a really, really good idea.
3378260	3382340	It also allows for better feedback, I think, of the game.
3384340	3388660	So if someone plays through that first level just really fast,
3388660	3393540	trying to get it done or get to the next level within that time frame,
3393540	3397060	they're not really getting the full experience of the game, is what they're thinking.
3397620	3401460	So by being able to sit back and do the whole first level
3402100	3407380	and chill with it, that's kind of what our old demos used to be like.
3407380	3412420	For example, we'd get those PlayStation demo disks, and it'd be like,
3412420	3414900	oh, here's the whole first level of Jumping Flash,
3414900	3417220	or here's the whole first level of Jammer Lamy.
3419060	3423060	You get a better chance to enjoy the game and play around with it a little bit.
3423700	3428100	And as far as some other...
3429620	3433220	They want to do some other types of experiments for different genre.
3433940	3437220	So one of them, as an example, would be
3437220	3441700	imagine trying an RPG and starting at level 100 instead of level 1,
3442420	3447380	or a turn-based strategy when you've got the full kingdom
3447380	3449620	instead of just a village at your disposal.
3449700	3454020	So seeing what the full advanced version of the game could be,
3455140	3457940	and that it might be worth owning to work up to it.
3460660	3466660	Now, there's a few other things going on with Stadia,
3468660	3474580	but right now they've been doing some more business with developers,
3474580	3477060	like giving them a cut of the Stadia Pro revenue.
3477860	3481140	And issuing out new developer tools.
3482420	3488740	So they are, I think, finding a bit more of a stride.
3491940	3495540	And I think that we're starting to see a lot more benefit for it.
3495540	3498660	I can also tell you that, with the exception of last night,
3498660	3502660	I have had a much smoother gaming experience on Stadia
3502660	3505940	than I have on even some home platforms.
3506660	3510500	Like, typically, when I'm playing Dead by Daylight,
3510500	3511860	I don't get lag.
3511860	3513940	Now, last night I had lag spikes,
3513940	3517620	but also the people I was playing with on Xbox and PC
3517620	3519540	were getting lag spikes, so I think it was their server.
3521060	3524580	So it's hard to do a skill check when you have a lag spike.
3526340	3531940	But overall, I think that Stadia has really made some very good improvements,
3531940	3534020	including just their user interface.
3536100	3539140	Like, being able to search for the things that you want to buy.
3539140	3541540	And I'm paid for Stadia Pro.
3541540	3542660	I'm fully down for it.
3545220	3556020	And then I found that the games that they're putting out for the Pro group
3556820	3559060	are actually some pretty fun games.
3559060	3562980	I've got some, and I own some big titles on there
3562980	3564660	that I just flat out paid for,
3564660	3566260	because I don't have any other way to play it.
3568340	3570740	I'm trying to see some of the ones I have.
3570740	3572420	I've got Cyberpunk.
3572980	3574820	I have the new Avengers game.
3578020	3582500	It's just really good.
3582500	3583780	Of course, I have Dead by Daylight.
3583780	3587380	But I mean, there's also some of those free games that...
3588180	3592100	Well, and I say free because I've got the...
3594660	3596740	Stadia Pro.
3597780	3599220	And there are...
3600500	3603140	There's just some stuff I wouldn't have tried before
3603140	3605220	that I've actually gotten a chance to try.
3605220	3610180	Like, I've got a copy of Child of Light.
3610900	3612420	I never got to play it.
3612420	3615460	I have control of Cthulhu Saves Christmas.
3616900	3618580	Doom 64 is on there.
3619700	3623780	Okay, so yeah, I know there's plenty of games available on Stadia.
3624100	3627620	It's interesting that they're kind of...
3627620	3629700	Like you put it, they're finding their stride.
3629700	3632180	And I think even in the very beginning,
3632180	3634580	there were a lot of people that were very interested in,
3634580	3637300	what can Stadia do for demos, especially?
3637300	3641860	Because you don't have to download some gigantic 80 gigabyte...
3641860	3644820	How big was that Final Fantasy Strangers in Paradise demo?
3644820	3646420	It was something like 80 gigabytes.
3646420	3649460	But something like Stadia, you could just jump right in.
3649460	3651380	And so it's interesting to see them sort of...
3652260	3654180	You know, I don't want to say course correcting,
3654180	3657940	but almost like making adjustments and sort of thinking about
3657940	3661220	how can that element of the trial game or whatever
3661220	3664820	be even stronger and building it based off the achievement?
3664820	3666260	Because I mean, that makes a lot of sense
3666260	3669060	is that you want people to take their time through that level
3669060	3671060	and not just rush through the first level
3671060	3672580	because they're against a timer.
3673380	3675780	Or say a two hour clock on Steam refunds
3675780	3677060	or whatever the case may be.
3677060	3680420	So it's also a very interesting flip in the industry.
3680420	3682900	And the reason why I say that is because I think about
3682900	3684980	back in the Xbox 360 arcade,
3684980	3688020	when all releases had to have a demo with it.
3688020	3690100	And there were quite a few releases where
3690820	3692660	when you got to the end of the first level,
3692660	3693860	which was the trial,
3693860	3695620	the thing would pop up and tell you,
3695620	3697380	you just earned an achievement.
3697380	3699060	If this was a full game,
3699060	3701140	we'd unlock the achievement on your profile,
3701140	3703220	press A to go to the store to buy this game
3703220	3704980	and unlock the achievement right now.
3705860	3709300	It's just, it's interesting that, you know,
3709300	3711620	when I think of achievement-based demos,
3712180	3713700	I think way back to that.
3714580	3716740	But it's interesting how Stadia
3716740	3718180	is kind of rewriting this a little bit.
3719700	3720420	You know, and-
3720420	3724500	And I was also gonna add in,
3724500	3726740	I mean, they had really good demos.
3726740	3729780	Like they had the Resident Evil Village demo up
3731060	3734260	and made it really easy to check out things that were,
3735220	3738100	you know, new without,
3738100	3739940	especially for me not having a PC,
3739940	3742660	it gave me a really solid chance to give it a go.
3744100	3745380	I think it's just a matter of time
3745380	3747380	before you search for a game
3747380	3749700	and it comes right up with try a demo now.
3749700	3750740	Now I know to some extent,
3750740	3752100	Google kind of already does that
3752100	3753460	in like written results and stuff.
3753460	3754100	But I mean, like,
3755620	3757540	there was a thing just lately on Google,
3757540	3759940	I think you search for cats or something
3759940	3763300	and this whole interactive thing with the cat paws happens.
3763300	3764900	You can click and they do that whole thing.
3764900	3766660	Like it's really just a matter of time
3766660	3769460	before you search for Resident Evil 7.
3769460	3772020	And sure, the search results come up really tiny on the left,
3772020	3773940	but then a big old box pops up on the right
3773940	3776500	and there's the demo ready for you to play.
3777140	3779300	And I'm gonna put something on cam,
3779300	3781460	I hope that people watching at least can see it.
3782020	3785700	All of this stuff on there is stuff I've claimed for free.
3786820	3787860	Oh yeah, because of the,
3788740	3790980	yeah, it's akin to a PlayStation Plus
3790980	3792420	or an Xbox Gold at this point,
3792420	3793380	you know, that stuff accumulates.
3793380	3794900	Or my Epic Games account.
3794900	3795940	Oh yeah, that too.
3796820	3800820	But I mean, the thing is, is that if I had
3800820	3802500	my Stadia controller with me,
3803140	3809700	I could take my iPad and play on my iPad if I wanted to.
3809700	3812180	I can play the full Dead by Daylight on my iPad.
3813540	3817460	So, you know, I think, I honestly think that,
3817460	3819540	oh, it stands for the third remastered is on here.
3819540	3820660	I'm getting it right now.
3822500	3824180	I mean, that's just sort of like how it goes.
3824180	3826340	Like I'll see new stuff pop in all the time
3826340	3829060	and I'll be like, oh heck, I haven't seen this.
3829060	3831620	Or I didn't even know it was on the platform
3831620	3835700	and it ends up being pretty, pretty fun.
3835700	3837380	You know, I find lots of neat stuff.
3837380	3840020	I've discovered like that Murder by Numbers game
3840020	3841140	that Bobby's fond of.
3841860	3842980	I've got it now.
3844900	3847780	You know, it's really been,
3849300	3852980	I have zero regrets about paying for this service.
3852980	3857060	And I wish that, I honestly think that this is the way
3857060	3859940	things are going to be going is all cloud-based.
3859940	3863540	I think once 5G is more accessible
3863540	3866340	and you can really take your iPad anywhere,
3866340	3868580	literally anywhere and play over 5G.
3868580	3872180	I think that's when cloud gaming really starts to like,
3872180	3875860	just, you know, go hog, you know?
3875860	3878740	Cause right now you still have to get a wifi somewhere.
3878740	3882260	But I think as over air internet becomes more and more,
3882980	3884420	at least in the big cities, you know,
3884420	3885860	more and more available.
3885860	3889620	I absolutely think that type of portable cloud gaming.
3889620	3891540	And that's why I think the way Microsoft
3891540	3894180	is aligning themselves is very intelligent as well,
3894180	3896260	because you know, the Game Pass stuff,
3896820	3900020	a vast majority of, I can't say all of it for, you know,
3900020	3901060	licensing or whatever it is,
3901060	3903620	but a vast majority of it is also just, you know,
3903620	3905620	you log in and there you go.
3905620	3907540	So it's just, it's interesting.
3908740	3912180	VO by Kurt in chat, also a Stadia fan saying,
3912180	3913460	I had to let my Stadia lapse,
3913460	3915220	but I loved it when I had it.
3915220	3918500	And Bobby Black Wolf reaffirming love for murder by numbers.
3919300	3920180	All right.
3920180	3923220	Meanwhile, let's go to the record before I forget.
3923220	3923540	Yeah.
3923540	3926260	I did find another unicorn in Dead by Daylight
3926260	3927700	and that game we're on Stadia.
3928580	3928980	Really?
3929860	3930340	I did.
3931060	3933140	Who was our killer in our match.
3933140	3934180	Oh, how interesting.
3934980	3937380	I think it was someone who was new to the killer.
3937380	3938420	We kind of noticed it.
3938420	3940980	So we're like, Hey, here's, here's some stuff.
3940980	3942020	I know you haven't played them before.
3942660	3944740	And I was just saying, and I was like, yeah.
3944740	3947780	I'm uh, and I noticed he had numbers in his name.
3947780	3948820	I was like, are you on Stadia?
3948820	3949700	He's like, yeah, I am.
3950420	3952420	And I'm like, well, so am I on a Mac is like,
3952420	3954900	I'm on a MacBook pro and I'm like, I'm on a Mac mini.
3955940	3961540	So, so it was another unicorn and I've seen other people on Stadia
3961540	3963940	who were not on a Mac.
3965060	3967220	And then I ran into another one of my people.
3967940	3968500	Interesting.
3969220	3969620	All right.
3970580	3970820	All right.
3970900	3972180	We're going to go to our next story.
3972180	3974100	Uh, I'm taking a quick restroom break.
3974100	3974500	Sorry.
3974500	3976500	So, um, stretch it out if you have to.
3976500	3977140	I'll be right back.
3977700	3978580	Don't drown.
3978580	3979220	I'll try.
3981540	3982020	Okay.
3982020	3982340	All right.
3983140	3991300	So, um, we talked a little bit about aim junkies and their lawsuit with, um, bungee
3991300	3998340	right now because of the fact that will aim junkies makes a cheat tools for destiny too.
3998980	4009140	And so there right now, the situation is that the initial lawsuit, um, the judge actually
4009860	4011380	basically dismissed it.
4011380	4019380	Um, aim that, you know, according to bungees own license agreement that they have to go
4019380	4026660	through arbitration in order for that to, um, actually, you know, continue on.
4026660	4031780	And so, um, because of that, you know, they have that chant bungee has to refile the lawsuit,
4031780	4033300	which they did earlier this year.
4033940	4041940	Um, but now of course, um, aim junkies is making claims, or I should say, just, you
4041940	4049700	know, jabbing them a bit with saying that their, uh, claims of grievous harm are, uh,
4049700	4057460	full of it, that apparently their con their council believes that, um, you know, more
4057460	4062340	of the speculative, um, stuff that they're kind of thrown out there, they're just trying
4062340	4065940	like different angles that basically come after this company.
4067460	4075060	What the, the argument that aim junkies is trying to make is that basically the months
4075140	4084100	where this tool is being used in destiny two were some of the highest months in the game's
4084100	4089300	history with bungee bungees trying to make the claim, of course, that it caused grievous
4089300	4095940	harm, and, you know, impacted their sales, or impacted the revenue that they would be
4095940	4099860	making on destiny two.
4099860	4104420	So it's going to be interesting to see, um, aim junkies is actually subpoenaed valve,
4104420	4108660	PayPal, and bungee to gather some evidence to disprove their claims.
4109460	4114500	And they're going to try to basically say that, no, it didn't really affect the game at all.
4115860	4121380	Like, I get what they're trying to say, but the same time, like, I don't think I can side with
4121380	4125380	a cheat, a cheat software developer for an online game.
4125380	4129700	You know, it's, it's an interesting thing.
4129700	4135780	It's a, it's an interesting approach to, you know, try to poke the bear, if you will, basically
4135780	4143940	just putting out press releases against destiny two instead of, you know, I don't know, hoping
4143940	4148020	that you get to look at your ass suit in court, which is probably going to end up happening.
4148020	4148820	I'm with you.
4148820	4151700	It's, it's fascinating that this is happening.
4151700	4155780	I mean, I hope they lose, but it's fascinating that this is even happening in the first place.
4155780	4156180	You know what I mean?
4156180	4160580	And I mean, the cheat makers, you know, like profiting off this whole, you know, creating
4160580	4162180	misery in an online game and so forth.
4162180	4162580	I'm sorry.
4162580	4165780	I don't have sympathy for the cheat makers in this particular case.
4165780	4166420	Exactly.
4166420	4168340	But it's fascinating what they're doing.
4169220	4173700	And of course, bungee is going to come in and say it caused harm because,
4173700	4175860	Because their lawyers are going to be better.
4175860	4177700	That that's how you file a lawsuit.
4177700	4182420	You have to prove that if they go, well, we're mad at you and we're going to file a lawsuit,
4182420	4184820	but it really didn't affect us at all.
4184820	4186580	You can't win a lawsuit like that.
4186580	4188820	You obviously have to prove that it caused harm.
4188820	4190500	And I'm sure that they could do that.
4190500	4195300	It could be speculative because it could be a higher month, but they could say that, you
4195300	4201460	know, because of this many cheaters out there, it caused, you know, players not to spend as much.
4201460	4206500	I don't know, but like they have it's going to be hard to argue against.
4207940	4214260	Bungee, but look, yeah, I'm just thinking that bungees lawyers are probably going to be well
4214260	4217620	better paid than the lawyers for this aim junkies.
4217620	4222420	And honestly, based off of the history of, you know, them taking on other cheat makers,
4222420	4223860	I don't think you have a shot.
4223860	4226740	No, I think it's lost cause to Mike Defton.
4226740	4228420	Chat says no sympathy for cheaters.
4228420	4229940	Yeah, pretty much that part.
4229940	4232260	Vo by Kurt says, well, they also have to protect their content.
4232260	4237140	Oh yeah, as far, I mean, I'm sure the bungee lawyers are at the top of their game on this,
4237140	4242740	but it's just, it's interesting to me that the destiny to cheat makers just didn't try
4242740	4247860	to like settle in a, we will disappear and never be heard from again kind of way.
4247860	4252340	But instead they're, they're trying to go out burning their bridges spectacularly,
4252340	4257620	which may result in financial penalties against them in a civil case.
4257620	4260740	And that's just kind of surprising to me that they, they want to go that hard.
4261300	4264340	Well, and they don't even have to necessarily prove, I think, damages.
4264340	4269220	They can, they can prove that they violated copyright and they could just, you know,
4270100	4270980	take that route.
4270980	4271780	I don't know.
4271780	4272660	I think they're gonna lose.
4273380	4274900	I know they're going to lose.
4274900	4275380	I don't.
4275380	4277140	I mean, yeah, that's a given, but yeah.
4278260	4280980	But it's fascinating that they're trying.
4280980	4285140	I mean, you have to look at them like you kind of want to go, yeah, you love to see
4285140	4288580	somebody fighting the big, bad companies, but then not like this.
4288580	4289860	Yeah, not like this.
4289860	4292180	It's like, no, I'm not going to root for the cheater.
4292180	4295380	And Bungie is actually, Bungie's okay.
4295380	4297620	Like I, like, especially compared to a lot of their peers right now.
4297620	4300020	What would be the precedent that would be set by this?
4300020	4302740	Like if they won't, you know, it's like, oh, okay, cool.
4302740	4305380	We're just going to have cheat programs all over the place.
4305380	4308180	Hey, all that online content you like playing stuff.
4308180	4310020	Well, it's just going to be ruined by everybody.
4310020	4310980	So, Hey, cool.
4310980	4311620	Yeah.
4311620	4315060	You're just looking at the destiny to cheat makers going, wow, they're doing that.
4316020	4317700	They're, they're, they're really doing that.
4318260	4320100	They're, they're arguing to be like, well, you know what?
4320100	4323940	You just have to cheat even harder, you know, it's back and forth.
4325300	4326420	All right.
4326420	4327300	Moving on.
4327300	4331060	Let's talk about something that Jason was making fun of in the intro tonight.
4331060	4333300	It's the announcement of an announcement.
4333300	4333780	That's right.
4333780	4339940	There is a Sunsoft digital event that is set for August 18th where the company will be
4339940	4343860	talking about upcoming titles for 2022 and 2023.
4343860	4346660	And it'll be on YouTube and a press release.
4346660	4351540	Yuichi Ochi said, although we've been quiet for some times, many things have been happening
4351540	4352820	behind the scenes.
4352820	4358580	We are very excited to be able to finally share our vision for the rebirth of Sunsoft
4358580	4360340	with fans old and new.
4361060	4362340	So interesting.
4362340	4367380	Now it might be worth looking into what they say in the press release.
4367380	4368820	What Sunsoft is all about.
4369460	4373620	They were established in 1971 as a part of Sun corporation.
4373620	4378260	And in 1978, they began to make video games and arcades with block challenger and block
4378260	4378820	perfect.
4379460	4385860	In the early 1980s, some of their early hits were Arabian, Icky, and Kangaroo.
4386660	4392740	On July 25th, they released the first NES Famicom title in Japan under Sunsoft brands
4392740	4394180	called Super Arabian.
4394820	4400260	And Sunsoft, of course, probably best known for their retro development, including Gimmick,
4400260	4407620	Blaster Master, Spy Hunter, Batman, Trip World, Euphoria the Saga, and much more.
4407620	4411780	That much more, including Fester's Quest, which I didn't see named in that press release.
4411780	4413780	I guess we're not getting a new one of those.
4413780	4414900	That's unfortunate.
4414900	4422660	So going in chat, Digirama S says, OMG Sunsoft, Journey to Silius 2, please.
4423220	4424660	Anything's possible, right?
4424660	4427300	Mike Deff says, how about a new Kangaroo game?
4427300	4428340	Give me that, please.
4429540	4433220	Hey, retro archives are all the rage right now.
4433220	4438820	Why not a repackaging of some of those arcade hits in some type of arcade package?
4438820	4439460	Who knows?
4439460	4439940	Who knows?
4439940	4440500	You know what?
4440500	4440980	Hmm.
4440980	4441540	You know what?
4441540	4447460	So like, you know, they started their company with some great arcade games, block challenger
4447460	4448900	and block perfect.
4448900	4450420	Now it's time to take a look at that.
4450660	4453140	Loki has been dismissed from Orange Lounge Radio.
4453140	4458260	I'm very sorry to say, please look forward to our next episode of Orange Lounge Radio,
4458260	4460900	where we will be replacing Loki with a ferret.
4460900	4461460	Thank you.
4461460	4461960	Good night.
4463860	4465220	I hope it's something good.
4465220	4467060	I mean, like, they're the games that they've made.
4467060	4468740	Like, Batman was great.
4468740	4471140	Like, all their NES games are great.
4471140	4474100	So I'd be curious to see what they're going to do.
4474100	4475700	Hopefully, they're going to be able to do that.
4475700	4477140	I mean, they're going to be able to do that.
4477220	4480020	So I'd be curious to see what they're going to do.
4480020	4483060	Hopefully not sequels to, like, really old games, because, like, I don't know.
4483860	4484820	I want to see new stuff.
4487620	4492980	Ashima Panic in our chat says that's what I thought to myself, too, as far as the blockchain
4492980	4493540	stuff goes, too.
4493540	4494820	And I pray it won't be.
4494820	4495220	You know what?
4495220	4498740	It's a very cynical but very realistic approach to that whole thing.
4498740	4501540	Ashima Panic also says Fester's Quest is the surprise.
4501540	4502660	I wish, I wish.
4502660	4507780	But as some folks in chat are saying, you know, those types of licenses, they don't
4507780	4509140	really have those licenses.
4509140	4513300	Now, as Joe and Hannah-Matt says, down for another Blaster Master game, honestly.
4513300	4520340	Don't forget, we've had very recently those Blaster Master reboot games that were really
4520340	4520740	good.
4521380	4522740	Inti Creates did them.
4523300	4526180	Blaster Master, was it Zero Mission?
4526180	4527620	I can't, no, that's Metroid.
4527620	4531700	I don't, there was a Blaster Master, but they did a whole trilogy.
4531700	4536580	And two and three had nothing to do with, like, they were just kind of like original
4536580	4540180	games that were done in the same vein as that first game.
4540180	4542020	Blaster Master Zero, that was it.
4542020	4545700	But that first game was actually a beautiful reboot.
4545700	4546980	Like, I loved it.
4546980	4552340	It was way better than the one that was done on the Wii, which unfortunately I think was
4552340	4553780	a Sunsoft endorsed thing.
4554900	4559540	But yeah, that one that Inti Creates, I believe, put together is great.
4559540	4563940	I just don't think there's room for Sunsoft to do anything else on top of that, quite
4563940	4564660	honestly.
4564660	4570100	I'm trying to think of, like, because, you know, I think Sunsoft's done a lot of shooters
4570100	4576260	in Japan, so that's probably something that, you know, they may be doing as well as rebooting
4576260	4576820	some of those.
4576820	4578900	They might not be as well known over here.
4578900	4582820	But I'm looking at some of the list of video games that they've developed in the past.
4584500	4589460	Interestingly enough, yeah, they're credited for Fantasy Zone, actually, but they did the
4589460	4590260	NES port.
4590260	4591780	But see, again, that's not their game.
4591780	4592580	That's Sega's game.
4592580	4594820	So they can't just say, oh, we're going to make a new one of those.
4594820	4597540	Well, the NES port was questionable at that.
4597540	4599300	Yeah, let's see.
4600340	4604820	They actually were the ones that did the Final Fantasy Legend games, but they were rereleases
4604820	4608100	and kind of like, you know, they were, you know, translated.
4608100	4611780	But some folks in chat pointed this out.
4612580	4617380	Some of their most recent releases were Clock Tower games.
4617380	4623300	So they did Clock Tower the First Fear, Clock Tower 2, and Clock Tower Ghost Head were some
4623300	4628260	of the last things that they did in 2012 before a really big break.
4628260	4631860	So I wonder if maybe a Clock Tower reboot isn't something.
4631860	4637300	That is one that I think that's probably the most likely thing is a Clock Tower reboot.
4637300	4638180	But we'll see.
4638180	4639780	I think that could be kind of cool.
4641220	4643140	Clock Tower characters for Dead by Daylight.
4644100	4644580	Who knows?
4645700	4646420	Oh, my God.
4647060	4650740	If they put that scissor guy in Dead by Daylight, I'm quitting.
4650740	4651700	I can't handle it.
4651700	4653460	I cannot handle Scissorman.
4653460	4654660	And I can't handle it.
4654660	4655220	I'll quit.
4655220	4655620	I will.
4658500	4659140	Too scary.
4660340	4660740	All right.
4661620	4664420	Anyway, thank you to everybody, by the way, in chat.
4664420	4669460	Literally three different clips of Loki getting fired here tonight on the show for a blockchain
4669460	4669780	joke.
4669780	4670180	Love it.
4672900	4673940	Thank you all.
4673940	4674260	All right.
4676980	4677540	That's true.
4677540	4681780	Orange right in chat says, guessing Rob isn't going for Team Scissors after all, I guess.
4681780	4682980	You make a good point.
4682980	4684340	I have to switch to Team Paper.
4685300	4686100	All right.
4686100	4687860	Anyhow, let's move on.
4687860	4691940	And Dark Sakura bringing back the classics.
4691940	4692340	Why not?
4692340	4694260	Let's bring back another horror classic tonight.
4695060	4695700	What we do.
4696500	4701140	So eight years ago, PT was delisted.
4702100	4706260	And the person who had to do the delisting has actually spoken out.
4710420	4715780	It was also the same person, though, who worked to have it listed.
4716660	4726260	So the former Konami staffer named Pearl actually had a few things to say about it on Twitter.
4726980	4733300	And Kojima actually acknowledged the eight-year anniversary after these statements came out.
4733300	4734100	So it was pretty cool.
4734980	4739620	But at any rate, some of the posts went along these lines.
4739620	4745300	A fun fact, since I was the lead at the time at Konami, I helped get this product set up
4745300	4748340	on the storefronts, fake publisher, and everything.
4748340	4753780	And I was the one who had to call Sony and ask them to take it down and block redownloads.
4753780	4755620	That was a super fun conversation.
4756020	4763460	And then, as for people who are asking, you know, why her response was,
4763460	4765860	I say this with love because Konami.
4767300	4768660	How many times have we said this?
4770660	4771700	You know, what's interesting?
4773300	4775220	I know this individual.
4775220	4775940	I don't know.
4775940	4780740	I think maybe we met once a while ago, but we definitely have mutual friends in common,
4780740	4784100	because if you think about where friends of ours used to work, they were friends.
4784340	4787940	Where friends of ours used to work many years ago, she also worked there.
4787940	4791540	I feel bad for her that she's becoming a main character because of this story.
4792500	4794820	And I know she's locked her Twitter down since then.
4794820	4797780	And honestly, I don't think she's did anything wrong here.
4797780	4799620	You know, this is, again, it's eight years ago.
4800180	4804580	She's not the one that pushed, I mean, okay, maybe she figuratively pushed the button,
4804580	4806100	but it wasn't her call.
4806100	4807540	She's just, that was her job.
4807540	4812180	She was the liaison between Konami and Sony and had to have these tough conversations
4812180	4814020	because of what someone else wanted to do.
4814020	4817860	So I actually feel bad for her that now, because she's kind of looking back and having
4817860	4823060	a laugh at this all this time later, that now she's like, this story has just caught
4823060	4828020	wildfire and she's had to lock down her Twitter because she's, you know, a completely
4828020	4831700	normal person with an interesting job in her past.
4831700	4836020	And it's just, I feel bad that everybody's scrutinizing this and all this stuff.
4836020	4837460	Yeah, going to chat.
4837460	4840260	Mike Defton chat says, yeah, she was following orders.
4840260	4841140	I can't blame her.
4841860	4846260	SSJ100Matt says our own Flaco Jones had the world record speed run for PT for a little
4846260	4846980	bit though.
4846980	4849300	Mike Deft says I can blame Konami though.
4849300	4850180	Fuck Konami.
4850180	4851860	Yes, you can blame Konami in this.
4851860	4855620	And I feel bad because I wonder if Konami didn't send a nasty gram over.
4855620	4856180	I mean, I don't know.
4856180	4857460	I'm making shit up.
4857460	4861060	Maybe she was just getting tagged at a lot of tweets and she went, you know, on lockdown
4861060	4862180	for that reason.
4862180	4868260	But I can't help but wonder if Konami didn't say something, which would be ridiculous.
4868660	4869620	The entire world knows.
4869620	4871380	But it would be totally in character.
4871380	4873380	That's what I'm worried about.
4873380	4875140	There's more that I had to say though.
4875140	4875780	Okay, please.
4876660	4877160	Okay.
4879300	4884500	Just to go back though to the comments on it, because that's really, you know, the first
4884500	4889940	and foremost thing about it is that she went on to say that it was a really awkward situation
4890500	4894660	and that they had to go through all of these hoops to get it set up.
4895620	4899060	Lots of operational exceptions, she said.
4899620	4904180	And then to send the request in to block it, more engineering workarounds, I'm quoting
4904180	4904660	now.
4904660	4909540	It was exciting to see people hype about it and see the work pay off, but in a way also
4909540	4910040	not.
4911700	4916020	And the other comment made, believe me, I wish it had gone different too.
4916020	4920580	It was definitely really funny to be plotting the secret cool thing for the fans.
4920580	4926100	It was amazing to see everyone come together to try to figure out the experience and see
4926100	4928100	them come away with so much love for it.
4928100	4930900	I'm super grateful I got to be a part of that in some small way.
4931460	4936740	So I don't see any flippancy about anything in her comments.
4937300	4942020	She was like, I was really proud of this and then it was really awful to have to take it
4942020	4942520	down.
4943220	4947780	I think it's very matter of fact and very transparent.
4947780	4949140	It's an element of transparency.
4949700	4951860	We never get out of Konami.
4951860	4956900	And that is why, unfortunately, she has found herself now everywhere this week is that she's
4956900	4958420	giving us an element of transparency.
4958420	4959700	We never get out of Konami.
4960420	4963620	So and technically we're not getting it out of Konami.
4963620	4964180	That's right.
4964180	4966180	You know, she's somewhere else now.
4966180	4966820	Yeah.
4966820	4972260	So it's waiting for NDAs and whatnot to have worn off before she could say something about
4972260	4972760	it.
4973380	4978260	I just also my other advice, not that, you know, Pearl should give a hoot what I think,
4978260	4985700	but my other advice would be clearly you could put this in a book and sell it, like put
4985700	4986820	it in a book and sell it.
4986820	4988340	Don't give it away for free on Twitter.
4989060	4992100	I doubt that this is going to be enough material to fill a book.
4992100	4994980	Oh, I bet.
4994980	4999460	But from the inner workings of Konami, I bet there is plenty to fill a book.
4999460	5001300	This is just one chapter, my friend.
5002260	5006580	I can tell you that only really a handful of people would buy that book.
5007540	5008100	I'm serious.
5010740	5012740	But look, look at where this story is.
5012740	5015220	I mean, it's catching a lot of places this week.
5015220	5021140	I think there's a lot of people, I think, that are interested in what the fuck happened
5021140	5021860	to Konami.
5022500	5023140	Like what?
5023780	5027060	Because we still don't really have an answer to that question.
5027060	5040180	I can also tell you that there are absolutely full videos online in terms of like 30 minutes
5040180	5041220	to over an hour.
5041860	5042500	True.
5042500	5044980	Going through a lot of that already for free.
5044980	5050580	I think the things that would have been said, hers is just like the last, the last nail.
5051780	5055540	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I know Kojima would never write it because he's a classy
5055540	5058980	guy, but I would read his book about the final years with Konami.
5058980	5064900	Well, Kojima should get his BFF to write the book because his BFF writes plenty of books
5064900	5067220	about the last days of game development projects.
5067220	5068580	So just food for thought.
5068580	5071540	And of course, I'm talking about Jeff Keighley, so food for thought.
5071540	5076500	But I do understand these are niche things for sure, but interesting.
5077780	5084260	At the same time, though, there was a really good video I watched maybe about a couple
5084340	5088420	years ago that really went in depth.
5088420	5094340	Some of it was very speculatory, but it had plenty of evidence to back it up about exactly
5094340	5101300	what might have gone down and the prelude to Kojima's leaving.
5101300	5104340	It went a lot into history and I thought it was really good.
5104340	5107940	If I can find it again, I will absolutely share it with everybody.
5109060	5113700	Well, it's interesting that one person that does not hold back in discussing Konami is
5113700	5119300	Guillermo del Toro, who in a tweet simply wrote about this whole thing, simply wrote
5119300	5123780	F K and to stand for fuck Konami.
5125780	5128980	He does not make his stance on Konami very secret.
5128980	5131860	So anyway, all right.
5131860	5137060	I think I also I can applaud Guillermo del Toro for taking a sentiment and just shortening
5137060	5138740	it to two simple letters.
5138740	5139780	Two simple letters.
5141220	5142100	All right.
5142100	5143540	Anyhow, let's move on.
5144340	5145700	We have some more stories.
5146500	5150180	Two simple companies slinging words back and forth.
5150180	5150740	Right, Loki?
5151860	5154500	Yes, it's like it's just never ends.
5154500	5160580	So we talked about last week, I think, where Sony had made the argument that, you know,
5160580	5164980	Call of Duty was this big franchise and they're trying to block the whole merger with Activision
5164980	5166100	and stuff like that.
5166100	5171380	Well, now Microsoft is accusing Sony of blocking games from being added to Games Pass.
5172100	5180180	They're saying that apparently I think this may even go back to the whole Call of Duty
5180180	5187540	stuff as well, but apparently Microsoft has been trying to convince the different agencies
5187540	5189620	that they can't shouldn't be acquiring them.
5190180	5194820	Microsoft's ability to continue expanding Games Pass has been hampered by the Sony's
5194820	5196500	desire to inhibit such growth.
5197300	5203140	Sony pays for blocking rights to prevent developers from adding content to Games Pass and other
5203140	5204820	competing services, they claim.
5206420	5212340	And then to throw a little bit more shade on Sony, Microsoft, you know, I guess Sony
5212340	5216420	was arguing that their their service is not doing as well.
5216420	5222100	And so Microsoft made a basically I don't know if it's like a PowerPoint.
5222100	5223700	I want to imagine it's a PowerPoint.
5224660	5225620	It's Microsoft.
5225620	5230100	They're not going to do it in whatever the competitors are.
5230980	5234820	Some document, of course, that they said, well, here's how you can make your PlayStation
5234820	5235540	plus better.
5236980	5238980	They provided their information to them.
5242420	5244180	So, yeah, it's I don't know.
5245460	5248660	Yeah, they have a 27 page document that they provided, so.
5250340	5251860	Interesting, all the shade.
5251860	5257380	Yeah, and also interesting how this whole Microsoft merger thing is playing out in these
5257380	5260100	different documents and so forth and the arguments that are being made.
5260740	5266740	I think my favorite was the one about like Microsoft saying that like Activision Blizzard
5266740	5269700	is that they aren't making anything that's like a must have.
5269700	5273540	They aren't making anything that good, which is wild to me that they would say that about
5273540	5274900	a company they're buying.
5274900	5279860	But like I also get from a completely legal, legal, strategical perspective, they have
5279860	5280340	to say that.
5280340	5282660	And what's what's one thing?
5282660	5287140	At least I know I've always said about Blizzard and, you know, in the past, before all this
5287140	5291460	drama, llama stuff in the past few years and Bobby Kotick's mismanagement, all this stuff.
5292180	5298260	One thing that Blizzard has always historically done incredibly well is taking a genre of
5298260	5304340	game and making it more accessible to a wider audience like Overwatch and Team Fortress
5304340	5313700	2, like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone, like EverQuest and World of Warcraft, etc.,
5313700	5314580	etc.
5314580	5319700	Blizzard is very good at this, and that's how they've made their bucks over the years.
5319700	5323380	And so it's interesting to me that like, you know, Microsoft's whole stance, you know,
5323380	5327620	is, well, they're not making you know, they're just making games in the same genre or what
5327620	5329780	it's just it's so wild to me.
5329780	5332580	But but legally, it's the smart play.
5332660	5333160	Yeah.
5333700	5334200	Yeah.
5335140	5338980	Anyway, why don't they just say that, like, you know, Bobby Kotick's kind of driven the
5338980	5341060	country or driven to the country?
5341060	5345940	Well, in some ways, yes, but the company into the ground and it's not worth as much because
5345940	5346740	of his sorry ass.
5346740	5349460	But I guess legally, there might be some issues with that.
5350180	5350680	Oh, well.
5351700	5356180	Anyway, let's move on to one more story before we take a trip down memory lane in the classic
5356180	5356900	game of the week.
5357860	5364260	And I wish this was not a story that I feel like we're reporting on way too frequently,
5364260	5368740	but I feel like this this whole issue just even escalated this week.
5369620	5370500	Made me sick.
5370500	5372020	Yeah, it really made me sick.
5372020	5372820	It's gross.
5372820	5379380	But, you know, we if if we don't say things about it and express that change needs to
5379380	5381700	happen, change needs to happen.
5382420	5388980	Um, so Clara Sorrente, who goes by keffles online, I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
5388980	5389620	I'm very sorry.
5389620	5394260	I admit I did not know this individual until I read this report, but I don't follow a lot
5394260	5396820	of the large popular streamers.
5396820	5398100	That's not me being edgy.
5398100	5399540	That's just me being honest.
5399540	5405780	So anyway, Clara Sorrente is a trans streamer and a political commentator and was arrested
5405780	5407380	by Canadian police.
5407380	5409060	And I want to make sure that's clear.
5409060	5414420	This is now a problem that's not unique to the US because there's already been going
5414420	5415220	on, though.
5415220	5415780	Oh, yeah, no.
5415780	5418100	And I'm not trying to say, oh, it doesn't happen in the US.
5418100	5420100	I'm just saying this is a large problem.
5422900	5429140	She was arrested by Canadian police after a swatting incident, and she put out a YouTube
5429140	5433620	video where she recounted what happened, saying that the police locked her out of her accounts
5433620	5437700	because she's still a suspect in this investigation of a made up fucking crime.
5438580	5440420	Like, wild.
5440420	5440920	Anything.
5442100	5442980	It's not just her.
5442980	5444980	It's her fiance's computer, too.
5444980	5446260	All his stuff.
5447060	5453300	Anyway, she uses her platform for Activision, like calling awareness to a California bill
5453300	5456340	that would protect trans youth that are fleeing the state.
5456340	5462180	And gosh, I wonder why someone would want to target her, which makes me sick to say.
5462180	5464660	But it's the quiet part out loud.
5464660	5465620	And it's sad.
5466260	5467860	And it's sad that it worked.
5467860	5469460	It's really sad that it worked.
5471380	5476820	The morning of Friday, August 5th, she was woken up by London police services that went
5476820	5478340	into her home with an assault rifle.
5478900	5485300	Somebody impersonating her emailed every city councilor in London, Ontario, saying that
5485300	5490340	she had committed murder, had a firearm and planned to go to City Hall and shoot every
5490340	5491380	cisgender person.
5491380	5495540	And it was signed under her dead name.
5496740	5497700	Yeah, and that's another.
5497700	5499860	What trans person dead names themselves?
5500980	5504420	Like, there are so many red flags here.
5506660	5509860	It's just, it's, yeah.
5512500	5513000	Anyway.
5513620	5515780	I donated to the GoFundMe for the record.
5515780	5516660	Oh, there's a GoFundMe?
5516660	5517220	I didn't know that.
5517700	5522100	Yeah, it's actually linked on your article.
5522100	5526020	Oh, yes, it sure is.
5526020	5530980	So if you actually search for her name, Clara Sorrente, or you can search for the Twitch
5530980	5535220	name, Kefles, it's a moving legal fund that's available on GoFundMe.
5537620	5542100	Also, it's pointed out that the Kefles is not the only streamer that is still having
5542100	5543460	these types of problems.
5543460	5549140	A Grand Theft Auto 5 streamer named Aiden Ross, another internet personality named
5549140	5551860	iShowSpeed also had SWAT issues.
5551860	5556020	A Hearthstone streamer had the cops invade her home on a live stream in February.
5559940	5561460	Where's the fucking end of this?
5562020	5568820	Like, this is still ongoing, not just nationwide, but worldwide.
5569620	5571780	And this continues to be a problem.
5571780	5580660	And I really like the part that just is that the basic fact finding education on behalf
5580660	5585780	of the London, Ontario police and these huge red flags we already pointed out about the
5585780	5590820	dead naming and some of the ludicrous things that were said and of the level of the seriousness
5590820	5597700	that they were taking is just like, this should be 101 type of stuff on how to spot a fake.
5598660	5602340	And I understand that you have to take everything seriously.
5603220	5605300	But you don't have to go to this extent.
5606340	5609060	I hope she sues and I hope she wins.
5609060	5611380	I don't know to what extent she can do that in Canada.
5611380	5614980	I'm not familiar enough with the laws and so forth, you know, and I understand it's
5614980	5619140	not as civil lawsuit friendly of a culture as it is here.
5620100	5622100	But I hope she sues and I hope she wins.
5623540	5624900	Maybe the money will do the talking.
5625860	5635460	This is why I'm a big fan of, like, don't use your, your, your birth date in your passwords,
5635460	5642260	don't, you know, don't do those little memes online, where, oh, put in your full initials
5642260	5644660	and do this or put in your date of birth and do this.
5644660	5647060	Now, thankfully, all of my passwords are in another language.
5648020	5656420	Um, but, uh, you know, it's telling people exactly where you live, you know, that's why
5656420	5661700	my last name is nowhere out there on the internet, unless it's like for something official.
5661700	5662200	Yeah.
5662580	5667780	You know, it's, you got to take steps to, to, I mean, it sucks.
5667780	5670900	You do have to take steps to protect yourself.
5671700	5677220	You know, you can, like, if you're on your social media or doing posts there, do it through
5677220	5678580	a VPN, for example.
5679540	5688420	You know, um, remember when I got like that series of harassing, uh, messages and I tracked
5688420	5692020	down their VPN, listed the address and said exactly who it was.
5693620	5695860	It was what's his face, his friend back in the day.
5696500	5698020	Oh, the one, the one that stalked me?
5698420	5699380	No, no, no, no.
5699380	5702420	It was, um, what was his name?
5702420	5709060	Oh, oh, I don't even want to dig, I don't want to dignify it with the name, but yeah,
5709060	5709620	yeah, yeah, yeah.
5709620	5710500	One of his friends.
5710500	5711000	Yeah.
5711860	5717300	And I basically was like, um, I just found your address in Granite Bay.
5717300	5718740	Do you want me to post it publicly?
5720660	5722340	Like, oh no, no, no, no.
5722340	5723060	I apologize.
5723060	5724740	It wasn't, uh, I'm like, whatever.
5725540	5727220	But it is that easy.
5727220	5735300	I mean, granted, it was maybe easier 10 years ago, but it's still fairly easy.
5735300	5740180	I mean, so like for the biggest ways that you can protect yourself, even though you
5740180	5746260	should not have to is, you know, never give out any of your personal information online.
5746260	5751780	Don't use your real name, uh, for your usernames, uh, look into a VPN.
5751780	5752820	Look into a VPN.
5753540	5757460	There is an anti-swatting registry in some states.
5759220	5761220	Um, so look for that.
5761220	5769620	And there's also, um, uh, some other, uh, legal counsel that might be, you know, out
5769620	5770580	there in your area.
5771300	5778180	But, um, but there are, uh, um, some anti-swatting resources out there that you can look into.
5778180	5783300	And I would, I would suggest, you know, if you feel so inclined, you might want to consider,
5783300	5786500	uh, uh, uh, donation on that GoFundMe.
5786500	5787700	They're so close to the goal.
5790580	5790980	All right.
5792100	5797380	But I mean, we've had people get 20-year prison sentences for, uh, swatting.
5798340	5799380	Yeah, they're not enough.
5799380	5799860	Not enough.
5799860	5800900	Different state.
5800900	5801140	Yeah.
5802100	5810660	You know, so it's, uh, but in a lot of states, it's, if no one dies from it, it's typically
5810660	5813300	considered, uh, aggravated harassment.
5814100	5820660	Although in California, though, uh, you, uh, if you swat somebody and you're, you're caught,
5821140	5825540	then you have to pay for the full cost of the swat or tactical response team.
5825540	5825940	Good.
5825940	5827700	Which is, can be upwards of $10,000.
5828420	5828740	Good.
5828900	5829300	Good.
5829300	5833140	Honestly, if, and if that ever happened to me, I'd file a civil lawsuit so fast, your
5833140	5833700	head would spin.
5834500	5839940	And in New York, um, you can be charged with murder if a hoax ends in death.
5841700	5842100	All right.
5842900	5846900	So I just wanted to throw that out there because I think people need to know their own resources,
5846900	5849780	how to protect themselves as well as yeah.
5849780	5853620	And it, and it's just one of those things where like, I, I, I take no joy in talking
5853620	5855860	about this, but it's important to highlight.
5855860	5863060	This is still happening and police departments everywhere, not just the U S everywhere, say
5863060	5867700	what you will about the police in the U S this didn't happen in the U S police departments
5867700	5876420	everywhere needs some basic education, basic education on how to spot this stuff.
5876420	5877140	Like it just.
5878260	5885060	I, my own point though, with, uh, the London, Ontario police is that they dead named this
5885060	5893060	woman continued to, and are doing all this, even though Toronto police, you know, dismissed
5893060	5895460	it outright and didn't charge anything.
5895460	5896900	And we're, we're good to her.
5898180	5902820	I'm also seeing this as trans harassment by a public facility.
5902820	5903220	For sure.
5904180	5904680	Yeah.
5905300	5910980	So she's got a suit and there will be people who will back her up.
5910980	5911220	Yeah.
5911220	5913940	And again, I can't claim to know how Canada courts work.
5913940	5918980	I barely understand it here, but I, if there's any chance that she can go for civil recourse
5918980	5924100	from the police department, she absolutely, absolutely, absolutely ought to do it.
5924100	5924820	Absolutely.
5926740	5927140	All right.
5927700	5932580	Let's go back to a simpler time when you know, you know what a crank, you know what a prank
5932580	5935300	was calling someone and hanging up the phone.
5935300	5937940	That's that was, that was the extent of a prank.
5937940	5942900	Let's go back to a simpler time as we take a trip down, go catch it.
5943940	5958740	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler California where I'll dive into the vault
5958740	5961460	and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5961460	5964100	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5967140	5967700	All right.
5967700	5970340	And dark soccer, what did you pick for us this week?
5971220	5979460	I picked Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc because, oh, I just hurt myself a minute ago.
5980980	5988340	I, uh, I love Danganronpa and I didn't realize that it was as old as it was until I saw that
5988340	5990260	the sequel was 10 years old.
5991060	5992980	So I decided to go with the first one.
5992980	5994340	I'm surprised I haven't done it.
5994340	5999140	And, and, you know, Shane is also a fellow Danganronpa fan.
6000100	6008980	Um, so at any rate, uh, Danganronpa is, uh, um, actually no Danganronpa 2 turned 10.
6009860	6014020	The first Danganronpa is, uh, it came out in 2010.
6014980	6024420	So, uh, but anyway, um, it is a visual novel adventure that was published by Spike and
6024420	6026580	it is the first in the Danganronpa series.
6026740	6034100	Um, it was released in Japan for, uh, the PS portable in, on November, 2010, later ported
6034100	6043220	to iOS and Android in August, 2012, localized and published in English, uh, by NIS America
6043220	6044500	for multiple platforms.
6045220	6053060	Um, so, uh, at any rate, um, you play a character named Naegi Makoto.
6053220	6062340	Um, and, uh, basically you're sort of in this battle royale situation, sort of, kinda, um,
6063380	6068500	he's considered to be the ultimate lucky student because his name got pulled at random to join
6069220	6074500	this school called Hope's Peak Academy, where everybody else is sort of like this ultimate
6074500	6074980	student.
6075060	6088580	Um, and so, uh, he gets, he, he goes into the school and wakes up with no memory of
6088580	6094180	how he got there or what's happened, just that he's stuck in, in the school with other
6094180	6098900	students who also were in the same situation, except for one who does not remember what
6098900	6099860	her specialty is.
6100820	6104100	Um, and she's also like probably my favorite character.
6104660	6112020	Uh, but at any rate, um, the game plays out very, very interestingly.
6112820	6123620	Um, so you find out that you are locked in the school, uh, by looks by this little half
6123620	6126020	black, half white bear named Monokuma.
6126820	6130420	Um, you know, as in monochrome bear, Kuma means bear.
6130420	6139380	Um, so Monokuma in order to cause ultimate despair, and I'm, I'm really trying not to
6139380	6143060	spoil it since now we've got people like, uh, Ramus is going to try to give it a play.
6143780	6151300	Um, but, uh, for all intents and purposes, it seems like it's Monokuma or whoever's controlling
6151300	6161380	Monokuma, um, has having all the students, uh, basically kill somebody and either there's
6161380	6167140	one person left or they keep, you know, finding out who did it.
6167140	6176580	So when, when the character, when the character dies, you have to, um, gather evidence and
6176580	6182420	then you have a class trial and you've got like, uh, like truth bullet events.
6182420	6185700	I think if I'm right, I think Danganronpa like means truth bullet.
6185700	6187300	I'll have to look it up again.
6187300	6190260	Um, but you also have to argue your case.
6190260	6195860	You kind of have some, uh, uh, like ace attorney elements in it.
6196500	6202420	Um, very similar to that with the investigation and finding contradictions and, but it's a
6202420	6204100	much faster gameplay style.
6204100	6206980	And you can have like a rhythm game element in it too.
6207860	6216820	Um, but the way that it goes though, is that if, if you figure out who the killer is, then
6216820	6222660	you, um, they get executed pretty gruesomely yet stylistically.
6223540	6230340	Um, and if you don't get the right person, then all the other students get executed and
6230340	6231460	the killer goes free.
6232260	6239700	Um, and so as you go through more and more of these, you know, you have your school life
6239700	6244980	mode where you can go around and talk to people and learn from them until a murder is discovered.
6245860	6253220	Um, there's even some kind of, um, like dating sim elements to it as well.
6253220	6254740	Like you react to different things.
6254740	6256500	You've got your free time segments.
6256500	6262340	Um, you can also find like, uh, hidden items throughout the game for extra stuff.
6262340	6265540	Um, but the big thing is looking for the clues.
6265540	6270580	Um, and you've also got your e-handbook, which is also where you can save your game.
6271460	6278260	Um, but once you have all of the evidence, so when you found every piece of it, um, I,
6279860	6281060	we have an ad playing.
6283060	6283860	Oh, sorry.
6284580	6285300	Oh, sorry.
6285940	6292900	I, yeah, I, I never noticed any of that cause I, I pay for my account.
6293620	6295940	Um, but anyway, pay for mine.
6297140	6297700	No, thank you.
6298820	6305140	Um, but at any rate, um, you know, all of these students are like that, that you have
6305140	6312020	are like, like the character on screen, um, uh, Leon is like the, the ultimate baseball
6312020	6313380	player.
6313380	6321940	Um, uh, uh, I'm trying to think of who others, uh, you know, we have the ultimate computer
6321940	6329460	program or the ultimate pop star, you know, the ultimate, uh, mangaka, you know, so, or
6329460	6335700	doujinshi artists, I should say, who was also by the way, voiced by, uh, uh, Yamaguchi Kappe,
6335700	6337300	who was also Ranma, just saying.
6338180	6341620	Um, but any rate, uh, cause I never played it in English.
6341620	6342740	I only put it in Japanese.
6343300	6350340	Um, so, uh, uh, at any rate, um, you know, so you go through the game, you uncover more
6350340	6358500	and more of the story and you learn a lot more about what's going on in the game.
6358500	6365540	Um, you play as Makoto and the, the girl I was talking to, uh, who was made to forget
6365620	6372020	what her specialty is, is, uh, Kirigiri Kyoko, who Kyoko is like, she stayed my favorite
6372020	6372420	character.
6373140	6382820	Um, um, but, uh, you also, uh, work with her quite a bit and she's got very keen observational
6382820	6383780	skills.
6383780	6389060	Um, you also find out quite a bit more about her and her connection to the whole thing.
6389860	6397540	Um, but going now back into some of the development, cause the development actually has to do,
6397540	6402900	uh, well, some of the evolution of the story has a lot to do with Makoto's voice actor.
6403940	6407220	Um, and I'm sure the moment I say the name, a lot of people are going to go, I know that
6407220	6415060	name, um, Ogata Megumi, who was, oh, let's see Shinji in Evangelion, uh, Sailor Uranus,
6415060	6425620	um, uh, Yukito in Cardcaptor Sakura, um, trying to think of some other ones that people would
6425620	6425860	know.
6425860	6433300	I know, uh, Yugi in Yugio, um, uh, I'm trying to think of some other ones that people would
6433300	6445140	know, uh, uh, Yukimura Sanada in, uh, Samurai Deeper Kill, um, also did some voiceover,
6445140	6448900	uh, did, uh, uh, Angelina Jolie's character in Hackers.
6450500	6457140	Um, also, uh, I'm trying to think of something else that is a little bit more recent that
6457140	6457860	people would know.
6458660	6470420	Uh, oh, uh, was also in Ray Earth, um, in Bleach, uh, Super Robot, uh, Taisen, the animated,
6471220	6481940	um, and also in Danganronpa 2, also, uh, played, uh, uh, another, uh, another character,
6481940	6486660	uh, there as well, who I will get into probably when I do Danganronpa 2.
6487300	6496260	Um, but at any rate, uh, the writer, uh, Kodaka Kazutaka, um, wanted to do an original video
6496260	6502580	game, um, and that thought his other ideas were too derivative from Action Adventure
6502580	6510660	and felt that Action Adventure was becoming unpopular, so he wanted to do a darker narrative
6510660	6511700	based around a killing game.
6512420	6518340	Um, the original version wasn't very high speed, but that developed on the way, um,
6518340	6524740	but Spike Chunsoft, uh, was, uh, thought it was pretty risky because it was kids killing
6524740	6527620	each other, you know, in a high school environment.
6527620	6533380	They really thought that that might not go over well, but a lot of people really picked
6533380	6536420	up the, the style of the game.
6537060	6544580	And so, um, they actually had some influence by, uh, by the late, uh, Hyde from, I don't
6544580	6551140	ever remember if it was Hyde or Hide, but from X Japan who did pink blood to censor
6551140	6552580	the blood and add stylishness.
6553380	6564900	Um, the, uh, the word Danganronpa came from a character designer, um, Komatsuzaki Urui
6564900	6569620	and was written in Kanji before it was changed to Kadokana for the logo.
6570260	6581300	Um, and it goes around themes of, uh, despair and hope and pulled from, uh, some, uh, influences
6581300	6583540	from Saw and Cube.
6583540	6585940	Well, you know, that Hypercube is one of my favorite movies.
6586820	6591940	And then it uses a special graphics technique that's called 2.5D motion graphics that
6591940	6595940	blends 2D character items in a 3D explorable environment.
6595940	6602180	So kind of pop art style, like you can see as you like walk into rooms with some of the
6602180	6605700	characters, how the items pop up like a pop-up book.
6606660	6609540	And then the characters are also, you know, that flat 2D.
6610500	6617780	Um, and then, you know, they threw in a lot of, a lot of like surprise things, like, especially
6617780	6618820	right from the beginning.
6619380	6627380	Um, but what I was going back to for, um, Ogata being, um, Makoto's voice actor is that
6627940	6636660	because of the energy and gravitas she put into the voice acting that Makoto was given
6637540	6645700	a bigger, uh, a bigger impact on the game made a lot more of just the, you know, personal
6645700	6652820	insertion character, but was, uh, made out to be a bigger, more important character.
6652820	6659060	And as we've learned now through the franchise, a pretty ongoingly important character.
6659940	6668660	Um, so at any rate, um, there also were, uh, some traits that were, that had in common
6668660	6672820	with Battle Royale, as in the novel by Takami, uh, Koshin.
6672820	6682820	Um, and, uh, they did originally also come up with the game with adult protagonists,
6682820	6687540	but they thought that high school students were better because of their immaturity and
6687540	6691780	would have more character development and that they would react differently than an
6691780	6693780	adult would to a killing game.
6694420	6701620	And that it's showing the balance between despair and, and hope.
6701620	6712260	Um, so, uh, Oh, an interesting thing is that when the English dub came out, um, the publisher
6712260	6716820	NIS was asked by Spike Chunsoft to keep Monokuma's name in intact.
6717620	6722260	And, uh, they also said though that that was their favorite character to localize,
6723060	6725060	um, keeping the voice very similar.
6725060	6727780	They also, uh, kept the same soundtrack.
6727780	6729220	Of course, the soundtrack is great.
6729940	6734580	Um, but some of the other, uh, voice actors that they chose, they had a really hard time,
6734580	6740260	especially for, uh, Toko, um, having an alter ego.
6740260	6742900	They had to get two voice actors for Toko.
6743460	6747460	Um, and then there were, of course, smartphone games that came out after that.
6747460	6748820	So we're going to go into the legacy.
6749380	6755540	Um, Danganronpa, Monokuma no Gakushu, um, which is Monokuma strikes back and then alter ego
6756260	6758340	were put out for iOS and Android.
6758900	6766740	And, uh, there also was a Danganronpa one, two reload, which was a Vita port of the first
6766740	6769380	game and its sequel Danganronpa two goodbye despair.
6770180	6774980	Um, which some people even say that that's superior to the first one, but I won't go
6774980	6775620	there.
6775620	6781700	Um, I think that Shane likes that one the best because of a particular character who
6781700	6783460	has a pet hamster.
6783460	6784660	Who cares what he thinks.
6784660	6785380	I'm just kidding.
6785380	6792500	I do because we, when we work together, I actually gave him a key chain of that character.
6792500	6793140	Oh, that's cool.
6793700	6793940	Yeah.
6794420	6798180	Um, I'm killing, I'm killing the B roll because I'm sick of all the ads.
6799140	6807380	My, my favorite in the second game though, uh, has a little, um, uh, Galaga ship, uh,
6807380	6813300	uh, uh, Vic Viper pin pixely Vic Viper pin that she wears in her hair.
6813300	6823540	Um, but anyway, um, now the, uh, the game came out, uh, in, uh, in North America, in
6823540	6825540	Europe in February, 2014.
6826340	6830340	Um, it came out on steam, uh, February, 2016.
6831060	6837620	Um, Danganronpa went to reload, uh, came out on PlayStation four in North America and Europe
6837620	6841380	in March, 2017 and in Japan on May 18th, 2017.
6841380	6846660	There's also a virtual reality demo called cyber Danganronpa VR, the class trial, which
6846660	6847940	is on PlayStation VR.
6849380	6855300	There is an enhanced version called anniversary edition that came out May 21st, 2020.
6855860	6860260	Um, else has, you know, it has the gallery mode, uh, like the other ones do.
6860260	6864980	Um, and there was also a few other things, um, it's going to be released for switch.
6865700	6871300	And then there's the Danganronpa Decadence bundle, um, will also come out separately
6871300	6877060	and January 18th, 2022, it was released for Xbox one and windows via the Microsoft store.
6877780	6879940	The game sold very well.
6879940	6882020	Um, it was a big hit.
6882900	6888900	Um, and they're also, um, I didn't mention it, but there is also like a full on action
6888900	6892580	game where you play as Makoto's, uh, sister.
6893380	6897380	And you have like a gun that has like different effects on people.
6898180	6900500	Um, you have to fight like all these Monokuma.
6900500	6905540	Um, and the thing I like about it is that that game, uh, it was, it's called ultra despair
6905540	6906040	girls.
6906920	6912200	That game also played a lot into the closing of the chapter.
6912200	6913960	So just go ahead and throw this out.
6913960	6924520	There was an anime which retold, um, uh, the, first of all, it had the, the prelude to what
6924520	6927720	happened in Danganronpa with the characters that were in the second game.
6928600	6934120	And then it was called hope and despair where it, you would watch one episode and it was
6934120	6939240	a prelude and the next episode was like in the future after the despair was already going
6939240	6940360	on with a different group.
6941000	6946200	Um, and there was also a Danganronpa anime just by itself, retelling the first game.
6947240	6954520	So, uh, there's, there's just so much, um, there's also Danganronpa V3 killing harmony
6954520	6956040	that came out in 2017.
6956600	6960440	Um, there had two manga, um, adaptations.
6960520	6968200	There was a light novel, uh, two light novels, um, called Danganronpa if, where, uh, basically
6968200	6972760	Makoto finds this, uh, fabled escape button early on.
6973400	6982280	And then there's one called, uh, uh, I'm trying to see, uh, the, the tragic warriors of despair
6983160	6989080	that, uh, is kind of like, they're both kind of alternate universe, uh, stories.
6989080	6990200	Um, I've read them both.
6990200	6990920	They're actually really good.
6991640	7003720	Um, but this, this game is like, it's just all, I really don't know what else I can say
7003720	7008920	about it because it's just had so much to it.
7008920	7017080	Um, the game has received, you know, just wonderful ratings all across the board.
7017080	7022280	Um, the Vita version has an 80 of 10 on Metacritic PC is 82 of a hundred on Metacritic.
7022920	7026920	Um, it's just, it's all over the place.
7026920	7028280	It really is.
7028280	7036440	In fact, last night when I was, uh, uh, looking up, um, the, you know, stuff to do for the
7036440	7040280	B roll, I just ended up just started watching through the play through.
7041320	7042280	I was like, Oh yeah.
7042280	7044680	And then I realized, Oh my gosh, what time is it?
7045240	7050040	Um, but, uh, but yeah, it's absolutely worth it.
7050040	7052360	And if you don't want to play through the first game, watch the anime.
7052360	7053080	It's really good.
7053800	7055960	I mean, it's really abbreviated.
7056520	7060840	There's a lot of stuff that you'll miss from it, but it tells the story really good, really
7060840	7061560	well.
7061560	7067400	And all of the games are just really, really awesome.
7067400	7069080	They're just, they're so in depth.
7069080	7074280	I didn't get into V3 as much though, but the first two and ultra despair girls, I was totally
7074280	7074600	into.
7075480	7075880	All right.
7075880	7076280	That's it.
7076840	7078040	There's just classic game of the week.
7078040	7081720	And I, I also was kind of surprised that this game is even 10 years old.
7081720	7085560	Um, I, you know, obviously more than that, but, uh, yeah, it's just another one of those.
7085560	7085800	Wow.
7085800	7086920	I feel like it was only yesterday.
7086920	7089320	I first heard about this game, but yeah, right.
7089320	7090280	It is your classic game of the week.
7090280	7092680	Don Gunropa playing it pretty religiously.
7092680	7093180	Yeah.
7093720	7094120	All right.
7094120	7097880	Let's travel around the world and quickly check out some other headlines in a segment
7097880	7099720	that we call rapid fire news.
7099720	7101000	And we'll start with Loki.
7101960	7107720	So, you know, getting a hint of all that movie action and movie money that they want.
7107720	7113240	Um, Bandai Namco is planning for a live action Pac-Man movie.
7115480	7115960	Okay.
7115960	7117160	Who the fuck asked for that?
7117960	7118760	Nobody.
7118760	7122680	Nobody asked for that, but you know, Sonic the Hedgehog is doing well and people love
7122680	7124920	Sonic the Hedgehog as much as they love Pac-Man.
7124920	7125420	Right.
7125800	7126300	Right.
7126760	7127260	Right.
7127900	7129900	Listen, here's the question.
7129900	7132060	Pac-Man's already gotten their live action movie.
7132060	7136940	It was, um, terrible and it started Adam Sandler and we don't need another live action.
7137660	7138300	Yes.
7138300	7141100	Here's the, here's the real question I have about this movie.
7141660	7143340	Will the love interest be Ms.
7143340	7147740	Pac-Man or Pac-Mom or both?
7150380	7155580	Will this, uh, uh, Pac-Man movie explore the complicated pack love triangle.
7155580	7157420	The Pac-Man suddenly finds himself in.
7158540	7163580	He had the Pac-Man story on our Saturday morning cartoons, right?
7163580	7164700	I just don't.
7164700	7168860	And there was also the cupid cartoon and I watched them both and they were great.
7168860	7172460	AJ twist and chat points out the smash multiverse movies grow.
7174780	7183420	Yeah, but like, I just don't think that this will just, yeah, I just, I don't see that
7183420	7185660	unless maybe they make a full on.
7186300	7188620	Oh, it's so eighties like comedy out of it.
7188620	7189100	I don't know.
7189100	7190940	It has to be right.
7190940	7193660	Aside from just like saying, you know, it's going to be terrible.
7193660	7197500	So this was reported, um, wayfarer studios.
7197500	7199580	They're teamed up with light beam entertainment.
7200460	7205100	Um, and they're going to make the live action movie based on it.
7205100	7206540	And that's, that's all we know so far.
7207180	7207680	Um.
7212300	7216700	It'll be based on a new original story from Chuck Williams.
7218780	7225020	And, um, he was the producer of, or one of the producers on the hedgehog.
7226140	7229340	Did you say it was light beam entertainment or light year entertainment?
7229980	7233740	It was light beam entertainment.
7233740	7234300	Interesting.
7234300	7237100	Cause I couldn't even find them on like Wiki or anything like that.
7237100	7238620	So they must be a huge studio.
7239980	7240300	Yeah.
7240300	7241100	So huge.
7241100	7249340	Um, yeah, I, I will Chuck, I think that's Chuck Williams company.
7249340	7255500	So, um, it says a original idea from Chuck Williams who did, it was a producer of Sonic
7255500	7257980	the hedgehog of light beam entertainment.
7257980	7260380	So it's probably his production company is what it is.
7260380	7260860	Oh, okay.
7260860	7261500	Bad idea.
7261500	7265180	Um, but can they not?
7268220	7268860	I don't know.
7269500	7270300	It sounds stupid.
7270300	7270540	Okay.
7270540	7273100	Whatever it may happen or it may get canceled.
7273100	7275020	You know, we'll see.
7275020	7279260	Um, anyways, aside from that, this is kind of cool.
7279260	7284700	So there's been a secret two player mode that's been discovered in super punch out.
7285420	7288220	Um, remember that game that came out in 94?
7288220	7291420	I mean, that was a while ago, but apparently no
7291420	7293100	one's found it until now.
7293100	7301420	And it allows you to basically control the other boxer, uh, with the second player controller.
7301420	7308780	So the way you do it is you hold Y and R and then press air start on the start menu.
7308780	7313580	And then it allows you to select which character and then player two gets to control it.
7314380	7316220	It's like, it's like the ducks and duck hunt.
7317100	7321340	And it works if you have the Nintendo switch online version, because, you know, it's just
7321340	7322460	a ROM of the old game.
7322460	7325900	So this is something that you can literally check out on your Nintendo switch right now,
7325900	7329820	assuming you have a, um, uh, Nintendo switch online account.
7329820	7330380	It's pretty cool.
7331820	7332380	Yeah.
7332380	7332700	All right.
7332700	7333900	So very neat.
7333900	7334700	Uh, dark soccer.
7334700	7338460	What do you have for us for rapid fire news or stadium news?
7339260	7347820	Stadia 4.26, uh, is putting in a claim all for pro games, uh, and some new, uh, language,
7347820	7348700	uh, options.
7349580	7353980	So, um, you know, cause normally when you have, when you get the free games, you go through
7353980	7357340	one by one and click claim, but now you're going to get a claim all so that you can just
7357340	7358060	get them all.
7358620	7365580	Um, they also, uh, and basically these come from just, you know, uh, digging through the
7365580	7376140	APKs, um, but they also are putting out, uh, some, uh, some, uh, language options, including,
7376140	7378860	uh, uh, Spanish.
7378860	7385100	Um, they're actually, I think, or they're doing both Castilian Spanish and Mexican Spanish.
7386380	7395180	Um, and then they're doing, um, uh, Turkish, apparently they're also doing, uh, uh, Caribbean
7395180	7395740	Spanish.
7396540	7400860	And then, uh, and also a few other ones on here from what it looks like.
7401500	7406540	Um, they're also, there's references to a, my library link, but no one really knows what
7406540	7407100	that's about.
7407100	7413020	And then there's also now references to a multi-stream and multi-stream controller.
7413820	7423100	So, uh, looking also into like some other, uh, motion devices and, uh, tips and tricks.
7423900	7425420	So kind of cool.
7428300	7428620	All right.
7428620	7438460	But yeah, I, I, I love when a company realizes that not everyone speaks the same version
7438460	7444620	of a language, you know, like even British and Canadian English is a little bit different
7444620	7445420	from each other.
7445420	7445980	Sure.
7445980	7446780	Yeah.
7446780	7452060	So there's words that are fully acceptable to say here in the US that are completely
7452060	7456700	unacceptable in England, as we know from Beyonce's edits.
7456700	7456860	Yeah.
7456860	7457740	Lizzo and Beyonce.
7457740	7457900	Yeah.
7458460	7458700	Yeah.
7459660	7464380	So I think that it's, it's really, really good.
7464380	7468700	I think that that's a great thing that they're doing, you know, understanding that, that
7468700	7471260	it may be the same language, but they're not spoken the same way.
7471260	7475020	It was, I was going to say that kind of goes the other way too, because, you know, there's
7475020	7481100	the see you next Tuesday word that is, you know, a very common, uh, slang and overseas.
7481660	7484220	Everybody in the UK right now, I'm using, I'm using, oh yes.
7484220	7484380	Right.
7484380	7485260	Cause that too.
7486220	7491020	Uh, but yeah, but that word is, um, very, very, very offensive, um, here.
7491020	7493260	So, um, yeah, I say it all the time.
7493260	7499100	I don't even, you know, I have way too many British and Australian friends.
7499820	7500220	I know.
7500220	7503580	I kind of, I got in a habit when JJ was visiting.
7505740	7510620	Anyway, one of my, one of my drag queen friends, miss Patsy declined to love you.
7510620	7511100	Mean it.
7512060	7512380	All right.
7512940	7515980	Shifting gears a little bit, shifting guilty gears a little bit.
7515980	7516480	Haha.
7517100	7520860	Let's talk about something that was announced, announced at Evo last week.
7520860	7523900	I think it was just about the time we were wrapping up OLR last week.
7524460	7529580	But they did announce on, uh, the end of the stream, uh, or sorry, at the end of Evo, uh,
7529580	7533820	that there was going to be some new DLC that was coming to guilty gear X two.
7533820	7534320	I'm sorry.
7535500	7535820	Sorry.
7535820	7537660	Not, that was the, that was the older game.
7537660	7542940	This is a new DLC that was coming out for guilty your strive, excuse me, uh, a character
7542940	7549660	that originally was in guilty your X to Bridget, uh, a character that uses a yo-yo and a mechanized,
7549660	7551020	uh, teddy bear.
7551020	7554620	Um, so, uh, Bridget is also a very popular character in the franchise.
7554620	7559260	Uh, so it was probably a foregone conclusion that Bridget was going to be added to strive.
7559260	7561100	So that was, uh, announced at Evo.
7561740	7565820	Now, another interesting thing that happened, um, as part of the story plot.
7565820	7570700	Once the, um, DLC was released and people were jumping into it and, uh, you know, exploring
7570700	7576140	the story, it turns out that Bridget, um, is now a pretty cool representation in the
7576140	7580620	game, uh, as Bridget was confirmed a trans character, uh, in the game.
7580620	7586060	I can't confess to know the lore in the game, so I don't want to like misrepresent something.
7586060	7591180	But my understanding is that, uh, it sounds like Bridget was kind of had a stereotypical
7591180	7593580	feminine design in the series.
7593580	7598380	Uh, previously, uh, the story that I'm looking at is she was born in an English village with
7598380	7602540	a male twin and the village had a superstition that twins of the same gender were bad luck.
7602540	7606780	So to avoid exiling her, sacrificing her, her parents raised her as a girl.
7607740	7612700	Um, and there's some dialogue that happens where one of the characters says cow girl
7612700	7616940	or a cowboy and Bridget responds, cow girl is fine because I'm a girl.
7616940	7621980	So, um, and that pronoun swap is, uh, intended to reveal Bridget's trans identity.
7621980	7625660	Again, I hope I'm reporting that right, but I'm not super familiar with the story in the
7625660	7626460	series.
7626460	7631020	Um, so it's, it's hard for me to say it's this or it's this, but, um, my understanding
7631020	7635340	is it's, uh, some representation, um, maybe unexpected.
7635340	7636860	Again, I don't know, I don't follow the series.
7636860	7638620	I don't know if it was expected or not.
7638620	7641580	Um, but, uh, more representation is always a great thing.
7641580	7642780	So, um, pretty cool to see.
7642780	7646620	And a lot of people on Twitter, uh, were very happy to, um, hear about that.
7647020	7648300	So, all right.
7649260	7653500	Anyhow, uh, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates
7653500	7655660	of some games coming out near you soon.
7655660	7657260	We'll start with the U S slow key.
7657900	7661740	So this week we've got fashion police squad coming out on PC.
7661740	7663660	Oh, you have, you've had your eye on that one.
7664220	7665420	Yeah, that looks fun.

7676940	7678300	Cause it's been on the Epic store.
7678300	7681740	It's been in beta, so now it's actually out.
7681740	7682140	Got it.
7682140	7682780	The real deal.
7682780	7683280	All right.
7684140	7684700	Right.
7684700	7690940	Um, so now, uh, we also have spark, the electric jester three on PC, uh, blossom

7725900	7726400	series.
7727580	7732780	I like this one curse the golf on a PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four,

7755500	7756540	Uh, they're great.
7756540	7764460	Um, time EISA on looks like PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation five and Xbox series.
7765260	7774860	We are OFK on PC, Mac, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and PlayStation five,
7775580	7777580	uh, tale of paper refolded.
7777580	7780220	Oh, that one looked, I think that was the one that looked really cool.
7780540	7789340	Um, that's on PC, Xbox one, Xbox series, uh, cloud punk coming to PlayStation
7789340	7793740	five, uh, layer land story on the PC and Nintendo switch.

7800540	7802460	five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
7803020	7804700	Oh, it's Madden time already, huh?
7805980	7806380	All right.
7806380	7807100	Yep.
7807100	7810540	Well, traveling to Japan, I don't know why there's such a stark difference
7810540	7813580	between the U S which is full of releases this week, especially with
7813580	7817580	Madden, uh, and Japan, but Japan has one release this week on the PlayStation
7817580	7819180	four and five it's a vampire.
7819180	7823020	The masquerade swung song gets its release in Japan this week.
7823020	7825900	Um, that's, I believe this just recently came out here.
7826460	7827740	That's that's it.
7827740	7829500	Uh, it's the only release in Japan this week.
7829500	7832300	Again, I don't know why the difference, I don't know if it's because maybe
7832300	7834860	Madden isn't as big of a deal over there or something.
7835180	7838220	It's more FIFA or whatever, but, or, um, yeah, I just.
7839020	7840700	Because they know what real football is.
7840700	7841580	I guess so.
7841580	7844540	I, I, yeah, it's just a much slower week.
7844540	7846940	So I will go over to the UK and see how things look over there.
7846940	7847500	Dark soccer.
7848140	7853420	Only, uh, four things, uh, on the 16th, we have way of the Hunter for
7853420	7859900	PlayStation, Xbox and a PC, uh, time Asia on PlayStation and Xbox on the 18th.
7859900	7863740	And then on the 19th, Madden 23 and bug snacks on switch.
7864940	7865420	Snacks.
7866780	7867660	All right.
7867660	7871020	Let's get some more headlines and then we will get to your calls.
7871020	7875420	If we have any tonight over it, uh, vog network.com slash discord.
7875420	7877820	Again, that's VOG network.com slash discord.
7877820	7880780	If you want to join in the conversation throughout the week, I promise.
7881340	7884300	We really, really limit the use of the everyone tag.
7884300	7885020	So don't worry.
7885020	7888780	And I know you probably have a hundred discords, but we will not spam you with
7888780	7890540	everyone tags unless it's really important.
7890540	7892540	I don't think I can't even remember the last time we used it.
7892540	7896620	We don't use it every time we go live, but, uh, you can see when hosts go live
7896620	7899900	on their personal streams, not within everyone tag, but if you keep your eye
7899900	7903500	on the, uh, uh, Twitch channel, it does show you if, you know, Jamie does a
7903500	7907020	stream or I do a stream or Bobby does a stream or we all do a stream, uh, all
7907020	7907900	pings in that channel.
7907900	7911180	So, uh, check that over at vog network.com slash discord.
7911180	7913180	Meanwhile, we have some more stories for you.
7913180	7913580	Loki.
7914540	7914860	Yes.
7914860	7918940	So apparently in attempt has been accused of firing, um, a worker for
7918940	7919820	speaking up.
7920460	7926380	So there's been some allegations according to, it's been filed with
7926380	7931900	national labor relations board, um, seeing, and I guess, uh, against
7931900	7935180	Nintendo and the contract hiring agency, Aston Carter.
7936060	7939180	And apparently they're saying there's concerted activities or they're
7939180	7942140	interfering with concerted activities of workers, including possible
7942140	7943740	retaliation and coercion.
7944940	7949180	Um, the actual allegations, like some of these were, it says within six
7949180	7953980	months employer discharged an employee or employees, uh, because the
7953980	7957180	employees engaged in protected concerted activities.
7957900	7962940	By, I don't know, this is lawyer speak inter Alia, uh, protesting terms
7962940	7964300	and conditions of employment.
7964300	7967980	And in order to discourage employees from engaging in protected
7967980	7971580	concerted activities, uh, it says within the previous six months, the
7971580	7976220	employer has interfered with risk with restraint and courses employees
7976780	7980860	in the exercise of rights protected by section seven of the act by
7980860	7984700	maintaining the work rules that prohibit employees from discussing
7984700	7987500	wages, hours, and other terms of conditions of employment.
7987500	7991260	So basically, you know, sharing what they're, they're making that type
7991260	7991660	of stuff.
7991660	7995660	And, you know, there's a lot of companies that will try to get you
7995660	7998300	not to do that, even though it is legal, at least in the United States
7998300	7998780	to do that.
7999500	8005500	Um, so interesting people to talk about what they make and verify
8005500	8008300	with your teammates, what they make for pay equity.
8010300	8010860	Yeah.
8010860	8014860	So, um, apparently there was a report that was published back in
8014860	8019500	April, Nintendo's president, Doug Bowser said, I posted a message
8019500	8023100	internally to employees saying that executive leadership team was
8023100	8026700	reviewing the allegations and the company had zero tolerance policy
8026700	8029420	for discrimination, harassment, intimidation.
8029420	8032300	But apparently like, it sounds like it's still going on.
8033180	8036380	And I also want to point out if you're kind of having that thought
8036380	8040540	of like deja vu is didn't already talk about this a few weeks ago.
8040540	8042620	No, because this is a second time.
8042620	8046060	This is a new incident than what was talked about before.
8046060	8050060	Although there are some very similar parallels here, um, including
8050060	8054940	both Nintendo and the staffing agency being named, uh, in what's
8054940	8055660	going on here.
8055660	8058860	And it's just, um, it's kind of showing that like, you know, I know
8058940	8063180	Nintendo, uh, oftentimes in the industry is viewed as they do things
8063180	8065820	differently over there and, you know, they get gaming in a different
8065820	8066940	way and so forth.
8066940	8074620	Uh, but some of the problems aren't necessarily, you know, invisible
8074620	8075180	over there.
8075180	8080300	So, um, so the ad, so what they said that also the, some of the
8080300	8083820	sources that were familiar with what was going on here said that
8083820	8087660	it stemmed from a contract employee asking questions about unions at
8087660	8092140	a meeting and later being fired over something, some sort of
8092140	8094780	borderline violation of their NDA.
8095980	8098220	So it's like kind of finding a reason to fire them.
8101420	8104220	I wonder if some of this, the fact that it's showing up in the
8104220	8108540	news and stuff is going to have Nintendo kind of realign some
8108540	8112300	things, or if this, they, they just try to make this mysteriously
8112300	8113500	go away, like the first time.
8114220	8114720	Maybe.
8115280	8115780	Yeah.
8116080	8117760	Well, thanks for bringing it to light anyway.
8117760	8119600	So it's unfortunate, but, uh, yeah.
8120160	8123520	Uh, as 200 Matt points out, it's an epidemic in the industry, not
8123520	8126400	just one or two companies it's everywhere and it sucks.
8126400	8129120	And I think that's one reason why when it is Nintendo, it really
8129120	8133200	catches our attention because Nintendo, unfortunately it's in the
8133200	8133700	same boat.
8134480	8138480	So it may not be quite as horrifically mismanaged at the top as
8138480	8140960	some of these other organizations we've been talking about, but
8140960	8142720	it's not to say the problems don't exist.
8143680	8149520	Well, it's really bad for contractors because they, they it's, they
8149520	8150640	could get you for anything.
8151200	8152480	Really, they could get you for anything.
8152480	8154080	And it's ridiculous.
8154080	8154580	Yeah.
8155360	8155680	All right.
8155680	8159200	Well, let's, uh, let's, let's revisit some classics again, not
8159200	8162000	the classic game of the week, but something else in the classics
8162000	8162960	department, dark Sakura.
8164640	8169280	Um, well, there's, uh, uh, more games, uh, announced for the
8169280	8172480	Sega, uh, the, uh, mega drive mini too.
8173440	8177520	Um, so, uh, of course it's coming out, um, in North America
8177520	8179440	and Japan on October 27th.
8180080	8187120	Um, it is, uh, going to include for cartridge titles, the, uh,
8188000	8189520	new, uh, announcements.
8189520	8192960	So we have gang ground fantasy star, two populace, uh,
8192960	8196880	sorcery and togyo King colossus and viewpoint.
8197440	8201760	And then the, uh, mega CD titles echo the dolphin CD robo
8201760	8206160	lest, which I own both of those romances, the three kingdoms
8206160	8210720	Shin Megami Tensei and Tenka Fubo a touch, you know, uh, local.
8214240	8216240	This is sounding like a pretty cool little device.
8216240	8217840	I hope I can find one.
8217840	8222880	Does this sound like it's going to be easy to get in your pre-order?
8222880	8223440	Yeah, that's true.
8223440	8224160	That's true.
8224320	8228240	As she says, I pre is doing that as one of the masses.
8228240	8230240	I pre-ordered the NA Genesis mini too.
8230240	8232960	Even though the shipping is 25 bucks for international shipping.
8232960	8233680	It's just annoying.
8233680	8235200	That's the only way to get it.
8235200	8237120	So, all right.
8237120	8238880	Just a few more stories for you, Loki.
8240000	8240560	All right.
8240560	8246560	And so EA is, uh, basically claiming that, Hey, you know what, you know,
8246560	8249280	those loot boxes that you guys always complain about with FIFA.
8249280	8252560	Well, it's actually, you know, what people love those loot boxes.
8252560	8253600	They love them.
8254640	8258480	And I mean, I understand what they're saying because, you know,
8260080	8262960	they, they're making dunk on them there.
8262960	8267280	Well, no, they're making the claim that we will hardly believe that ultimate team in the,
8267280	8273920	the food packs, um, have been, which have been part of the game for more than a decade are
8273920	8275920	part of the FIFA that players love.
8276720	8281680	Fans love that game reflects, uh, the real world excitement, strategy of building, managing
8281680	8285600	a squad, giving players a choice to spend if they want is fair.
8287360	8291520	The reason why I think that they're saying that they love them is because they're making
8291520	8296320	so much money from them because people are buying them and because people are buying them.
8296320	8299200	But I don't know if people necessarily love them.
8299200	8304400	I think that there's a lot, a good percentage of people that are pressured into buying them
8304400	8308880	because either they're susceptible to that type of practice or frustration or whatever
8308880	8310000	the case may be.
8310000	8310400	Loki.
8310400	8311440	I got some breaking news.
8311440	8312480	I have some breaking news.
8312480	8316320	EA is saying right now that people love taxes.
8316880	8318400	People love taxes.
8319120	8321120	Loki, everybody's paying them.
8321120	8324640	Well, except some people, most people are paying taxes.
8325360	8327120	I'm actually kind of a fan of taxes.
8328880	8329200	But yeah.
8330000	8330880	All right.
8330880	8332080	You'd love to be contrarian.
8332080	8332400	All right.
8333280	8334640	I'm a big socialist.
8334640	8335040	I know.
8335680	8341040	I like my taxes when they go for things like infrastructure and roads and education and
8341040	8343680	stuff like that that we probably wouldn't afford if we didn't have taxes.
8343680	8344000	All right.
8344000	8345440	Thanks for poking a hole in my joke.
8345440	8346480	Finish your story, Loki.
8347520	8351680	So I mean, yeah, that's the argument that they're trying to make is basically that,
8351680	8352400	hey, you know.
8353920	8358080	The people buy them, we make tons of money off of them, and so therefore people love
8358080	8358400	them.
8358400	8360880	I don't know that's necessarily true, though.
8360880	8365760	And obviously there's other issues with it, like the fact that it may be addictive, like
8365760	8367040	gambling and stuff like that.
8367040	8372160	It has the same type of, you know, feedback for like a person when they're purchasing
8372160	8373680	those and opening them up and stuff.
8373680	8380640	So I mean, obviously, if it was all fun and games, then they wouldn't be banned in a few
8380640	8385920	countries already because it goes against their gambling laws or they wouldn't be, you
8385920	8392240	know, catching the attention of congressmen because it's it.
8393280	8395440	Sure, I get it.
8395440	8396560	Like loot box.
8396560	8400880	People do buy those and there's a lot like people that will buy large quantities of those.
8400880	8404720	Hell, there's like streamers out there that will pay hundreds of thousands of dollars
8404720	8408400	for like DLC for games because it's content.
8408400	8409440	Diablo immortal.
8409440	8411360	Yeah, which is horrible.
8411360	8413120	But like, that's what they're going to use.
8413120	8417680	Like one person paid us a hundred thousand dollars.
8417680	8420320	Like, of course, we're going to keep doing it.
8423840	8424400	Yeah.
8424400	8428640	And yeah, and that Diablo immortal, you know, even though I say that kind of tongue in cheek,
8428640	8432720	it's it's the same thing because that game is making lots and lots and lots of money.
8432720	8436320	And I'm not so sure it deserves to make as much money as it's making.
8436320	8439760	But a lot of this content creators out there, you know, you've heard the horror stories
8439760	8442400	about somebody spending a hundred thousand dollars and all this stuff.
8442480	8446400	Sure, that's just one person, but it's one person spending a hundred thousand.
8446400	8448320	How many others are spending thousands of dollars?
8448320	8449360	And it adds up.
8449360	8450640	It's it's wild.
8451360	8453120	So all right.
8454000	8455920	Anyhow, one more story for you.
8455920	8460000	And this is in the sadness department, but I'm sure many of you have heard this week
8460000	8465920	that we lost Olivia Newton-John, of course, is the you know, everybody knows Olivia Newton-John
8465920	8466480	from Greece.
8467280	8471520	If you're Dark Soccer, I was just about to say, if you let me finish.
8471520	8478800	It was Xanadu, which had that animation part in there that was done by Don Bluth, who did
8479440	8483600	Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, you know, had that little bit in Xanadu.
8483600	8490080	But of course, of course, of course, we have to mention what you might wonder, what does
8490080	8492640	Olivia Newton-John have to do with video games?
8492640	8498560	Well, I would hope I would hope you know where this show has its roots, and that is with
8498560	8499840	Dance Dance Revolution.
8499840	8504000	And the very first song many people played in Dance Dance Revolution back in the day,
8504000	8509520	I know it was the first song I ever played, was a cover by the Olivia Project who covered
8509520	8513120	Olivia Newton-John songs, and it was much cheaper to get the rights to those.
8513120	8517200	A cover of Olivia Newton-John called Have You Never Been Mellow.
8517200	8522240	Now, if your first time you played DDR was on a third mix machine, perhaps you actually
8522240	8528400	played on Xanadu, which was another Olivia Project song that was in DDR.
8528400	8532720	And what's really funny is that there's some commentary I'm seeing on that where people
8532720	8538240	thought the movie Xanadu was about like a demon princess or something because of the
8538240	8545840	background in DDR, because it has a very strange, like, shadowy lady figure with eyes.
8545840	8551840	And it's like, no, Xanadu is about a roller rake and a muse.
8551920	8553520	And it has Gene Kelly in it.
8553520	8553760	Yeah.
8554400	8556560	It was Queen Kelly's last acting role.
8556560	8556800	Yeah.
8557520	8565600	So we watched Xanadu in my dorm room, me and Finara, when Gene Kelly died, and our other
8565600	8566400	friends there.
8566400	8571760	And then I watched Xanadu after Olivia Newton-John died, and I played the soundtrack on my stream.
8572800	8577040	Well, all of her stuff, not all the ELO stuff, because, I mean, Electric Light Orchestra.
8577920	8581120	And she was also in...
8581120	8585200	Actually, my favorite song that she did was from another movie with John Travolta that
8585200	8587680	for the life of me, I can't remember the name because it's not a good movie.
8588560	8593040	But Twist of Fate.
8594240	8595520	Oh, where the song comes from?
8596240	8596560	Yeah.
8598160	8599680	Well, the song is what I like.
8601200	8602960	Although the video is like fucking weird.
8603600	8606240	But there's a great lip sync on Drag Race.
8606240	8609440	And Olivia Newton-John was there, and it was Katya versus Sasha Bell.
8609440	8609840	Oh, yeah.
8609840	8610320	Yeah.
8610320	8610880	That one was...
8610880	8611760	I remember that.
8611760	8615600	But that is, though, my favorite Olivia Newton-John song.
8615600	8618400	And she was looking really well.
8619280	8619840	Oh, she was.
8619840	8621440	Whenever I see her on TV.
8621440	8624080	She had battled cancer several times, unfortunately.
8624080	8626880	That's stage four metastatic breast cancer.
8627680	8631280	Now, Bubby Blackwolf in chat points out, I thought Butterfly was people's first.
8631280	8632720	Well, here's the thing.
8633040	8636320	In the original DDR game, there was only so many songs.
8636320	8641360	And the easiest song, the one footer song was that.
8641360	8643280	So most people started there.
8643280	8644240	But here's the thing.
8644240	8647520	Most games of DDR were about three songs back then.
8647520	8652640	So you would play Have You Never Been Mellow, Boom Boom Dollar, which was the two footer,
8652640	8654960	and then Butterfly, which was the three footer.
8654960	8657040	So Butterfly was kind of in your first set.
8657040	8661840	And Butterfly was also the song that like, have you never been mellow, you may or may
8661840	8666000	not have recognized depending on how much you knew about 70s hits and so forth.
8666000	8671200	But like, Butterfly was like that uniquely DDR sound to it.
8671200	8672320	You know, that really started.
8672320	8674480	And it's got a catchy fucking hook.
8674480	8677840	That's not to say the Olivia Newton-John song doesn't, but that was more of a slow
8677840	8678160	jam.
8678160	8680320	It was meant to be the starter song.
8680320	8687280	Butterfly had a very catchy hook that, you know, that whole thing that made it stick
8687280	8687840	with people.
8687840	8689840	And so they remember that.
8689840	8692720	And of course, you know, some people didn't start with the easiest song.
8692720	8694320	They might have amped it up a little bit.
8694320	8697120	So or they didn't start on a 1.0 machine.
8697120	8703040	They may have started on a USA mix, which I don't think did the USA mix have Butterfly?
8703040	8703680	I don't think it did.
8703680	8705920	It had Boys by Smile DJ, but not Butterfly.
8706480	8707280	I had the Speed Mix.
8707280	8709600	May have had the Uprising one.
8709600	8710100	Yeah.
8711040	8716240	There is something that is worth noting is that when Have You Never Been Mellow came
8716240	8720560	out, it was when she was being marketed as a country singer.
8721760	8725200	And it was her first charting single in Japan.
8725760	8726880	No, it wasn't on there.
8727840	8730080	Yeah, no, I know the original Butterfly wasn't on USA mix.
8730080	8730640	I remember that.
8730640	8733200	The Speed Mix, I think was, but not the original.
8733200	8734400	No, neither.
8734400	8735120	Really?
8735120	8736880	Okay, interesting.
8736880	8740080	It also makes me think that that's why that song was in DDR.
8740080	8744960	It's very easy to confuse third mix with USA mix because they had the same interface.
8744960	8749360	So sometimes it kind of blurs together a little bit, but I distinctly remember Boys
8749360	8752240	by Smile DK was like the song that was in there.
8752240	8756160	And then Boom Boom Dollar was definitely in it because that ended up being kind of in
8756160	8756640	there.
8756640	8756960	What?
8758080	8759360	No, that was third mix.
8760080	8761600	It was in the home version then.
8763680	8764640	It had to have been.
8765520	8766080	Maybe.
8766080	8766720	Wow.
8766720	8768480	If I forgot that, boy, oh boy.
8770320	8773040	You think we're talking about games that were 20 years old or something?
8773760	8774400	Oh my gosh.
8774400	8775920	She was in Sharknado 5.
8776800	8777440	Oh, was she?
8777440	8778320	That's funny.
8778320	8781280	And I'm also like, wait, there was a Sharknado 5?
8782400	8785200	All right, we're going to get to the listener round table.
8785200	8790880	We want to invite your chat comments, your emails, your tweets, and Discord calls over
8790880	8795440	at our green room over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8795440	8796400	One last little thing.
8796400	8798560	The movie I couldn't think of the name of is Two of a Kind.
8799200	8799680	Oh, okay.
8800800	8801300	Okay.
8802100	8806260	I don't think I ever saw that, but I know she did make that other movie with John Travolta
8806260	8806900	after the fact.
8806900	8807700	I just never saw it.
8808500	8809860	So, all right.
8809860	8814020	I'm checking quickly to see if we got any tweets this week over at OLR.
8814740	8817460	I'll check in with Dark Soccer to see if anybody emailed us.
8817460	8820340	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
8820900	8821940	We just had garbage.
8822740	8823780	Garbage.
8823780	8824580	Which I deleted.
8825140	8831460	And I will say we had one tweet this week from Office Underscore Stop, who tweeted us
8831460	8833060	during last week's show.
8833060	8836580	And I thought this was pretty cool because they actually showed off their setup here
8836580	8840420	Sunday night with Twitch, VOG Network, OLR, and the Steam Deck.
8840420	8844740	And for those of you that are listening on the podcast feed, they've got OLR up on the
8844740	8848900	television, a Steam Deck on their lap, and then what was the other thing they named?
8849940	8853140	Something else multitasking on the laptop in front of them.
8853140	8855060	That's an impressive amount of multitasking.
8855060	8855780	But you know what?
8855780	8859300	Hey, if we're your background noise, I'll take it.
8861300	8862900	I'm happy to be your background noise.
8863860	8868500	And Bobby Black Wolf points out that doesn't look like OLR on the TV.
8869060	8871700	No, it is the Bobby Black Wolf logo.
8871700	8873780	But I will point out, it's probably very hard to see.
8873780	8878340	It says underneath that Bobby Black Wolf logo, thanks for watching.
8879540	8881300	Meaning your show is over.
8884100	8889060	They were preparing for OLR, but I'm glad that they spent all of Sunday night here at
8889060	8890180	the Voice of Geeks Network.
8890180	8892260	So appreciate that and the tweet.
8892260	8894180	I'd love to see other people set up.
8894180	8899060	If you have a complex system of multitasking while you participate with OLR, to be honest,
8899060	8899860	I'd love to see it.
8899860	8900900	Tweet us at OLR.
8901460	8902180	I'll retweet.
8902180	8902680	I will.
8903300	8904100	I love retweeting.
8904100	8905140	Did I retweet that one?
8906580	8907460	I don't know if I did.
8909060	8910420	Maybe I quote tweeted it.
8910420	8911540	Oh, one quote tweet.
8911540	8912100	Oh, yes, I did.
8912100	8913060	I quote tweeted it.
8913220	8916180	So send us your setups for OLR.
8916180	8918340	Twitter.com slash OLR.
8919220	8922420	All right, so no emails, no other tweets.
8922420	8925380	How about any last minute stories or things from Loki?
8926020	8927140	No, I don't have anything.
8927140	8927640	All right.
8928340	8928840	Wow.
8931060	8931940	No one's calling?
8931940	8933540	I know we don't have calls either.
8933540	8938420	Well, you know, honestly, it was kind of a slower news week, all things considered.
8938420	8941780	I mean, again, Jason kind of razzed us in the intro there about the announcement of an
8941780	8945300	announcement, and you heard the Japanese release dates there.
8945300	8949620	We are in that kind of end of summer period where, you know, it's going to start to ramp
8949620	8951700	up once we get past about Labor Day.
8951700	8956660	Then that's when the holidays, you know, pumpkin spice lattes hit Starbucks, and then that's
8956660	8959700	when, you know, things start to really ramp up.
8959700	8962580	So anyway, gingerbread latte wins.
8962580	8967140	Well, remember, all that stuff is kind of I want to say it's over for me, but it's not
8967140	8968660	what it was for me anymore.
8968660	8970340	Pumpkin candles are all I get.
8970900	8974020	Find the sugar free syrup all the time, by the way.
8974020	8974500	Yes.
8974500	8975540	And I will get used to them.
8975540	8981860	And I think I still have some from a grandpa care package from a year ago, but I will say
8981860	8982360	this.
8983140	8988260	The Starbucks competitor Dutch Brothers here in this area is well stocked with sugar free
8988260	8988740	syrups.
8988740	8992740	So I'm fully expecting they will have sugar free pumpkin.
8992740	8995620	So I'll get to have my pumpkin here or there.
8995620	8997460	And DGRMS brings up apple spice.
8998100	9003460	The thing is, with as much as I got about the Rob loves everything pumpkin, people sometimes
9003460	9004100	forgot.
9004100	9006180	I also love the apple stuff.
9006180	9010500	I also love the whatever drink that was the gingerbread, although I don't think they've
9010500	9013460	had that for years, but I loved that when that was around.
9013460	9015540	So just try this in the future.
9015540	9021060	Get for anyone who liked the apple, get a tall chai latte and add one pump of the apple
9021060	9021560	to it.
9022100	9023220	It is a delight.
9024660	9025460	Perfect.
9025460	9026180	All right.
9026260	9029780	So let's get everybody's final thoughts and then we'll wrap up.
9029780	9032740	Dark Soccer, I know you probably want to use the restroom and stuff before you stream.
9032740	9034900	So why don't you give us your final thought tonight?
9036580	9038660	Fix the camping behavior.
9038660	9043860	Take my advice and just teleport killers away from the hook for 10 seconds after they've
9043860	9046500	hooked somebody and it will be perfect.
9046500	9047300	The end.
9047300	9053300	I'm excited to see what that Rebecca perk does to the meta because they're definitely
9053300	9053940	targeting that.
9053940	9054420	So we'll see.
9054420	9056020	You might get your wish a little bit.
9056020	9057380	My favorite thing out of that though.
9057380	9059300	I hate the RPD is being split.
9059300	9060660	I mean, I like the changes.
9060660	9064020	They look good, but I like the full RPD because that is my pig map.
9065140	9070020	But Wesker has heat powers and I love it.
9070020	9074180	And I was watching LC do survivor bowling with it.
9075060	9077700	Wesker's heat power is going to be very interesting in the full game.
9077700	9079940	I'm excited to see Wesker's heat power is amazing.
9079940	9080500	All right.
9080500	9081060	Have a good stream.
9081940	9084980	Hey, I forgot to say I forgot to say before, oh no, not for you.
9084980	9092100	Just for in general, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please
9092100	9092900	help us spread the word.
9092900	9096260	Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
9096260	9098500	but we need more voices to put out here on air.
9098500	9102740	So leave a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you heard about
9102740	9103780	Orange Launch Radio.
9103780	9106020	All of that goes an awful long way as well.
9106020	9106340	Okay.
9106340	9108020	I just want to make sure I say that as well.
9108020	9109060	I say it every week.
9109060	9113300	It doesn't mean we get five star reviews, but I'm going to try, although I didn't check
9113300	9114260	the store in the last couple of weeks.
9114260	9115060	Maybe we did get one.
9115060	9118660	So Loki, do you have a final thought for tonight?
9118660	9120900	Um, yeah, I probably just try to stream more.
9121620	9121940	You should.
9121940	9122820	I can't wait to see it.
9122820	9123320	I hope you do.
9124100	9124600	Yeah.
9126260	9129860	My final thought, Dragon Con, two and a half weeks away.
9129860	9131300	Where did time go?
9132180	9136100	Dragon Con, Twitch Con, a month after that.
9136740	9138980	And then, which yes, I'm going.
9138980	9140340	And I heard about all the safety.
9140340	9142980	I know I kept cutting those stories about the safety changes.
9143060	9146980	But yeah, they went back to being safe about it now.
9147780	9149220	It's whatever for me.
9149220	9152340	Like, you know, maybe I'm just riding this wave because I'm like, I had it.
9152340	9154180	I'm immune for eight weeks now.
9154180	9157460	So, but I'm just like, if they want me to wear a mask, fine, I'll wear a mask.
9157460	9163940	But if not, like, we're getting to this point where it's like, what can you do at this point?
9163940	9167620	You just have to kind of hope the virus keeps mutating in a direction where it is getting
9167620	9168340	weaker and weaker.
9168340	9172180	And that's the good news is the one that everybody's getting is a lot weaker than what it used
9172180	9172740	to be.
9172740	9175380	Not to minimize it, but it is.
9175380	9176580	Look at the stats anyway.
9178260	9180180	And then what was the other thing I was gonna say?
9180180	9183140	Oh, then now I'm going to Seattle in November.
9183140	9184820	So I'm really looking forward to that, though.
9184820	9186020	So, all right.
9186820	9187540	That's it.
9187540	9189380	Have a great night, everybody.
9189380	9192580	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9192580	9194260	Have a wonderful night.
