0	13680	In the era of mass storage and everything, connectivity by default, gaming adapts to
13680	15860	make continued use of it like everything else.
15860	19620	Instead of getting an entire game upfront, published to physical media and then going
19620	23780	unchanged, now more games can push a solid foundation and continue developing it as time
23780	24780	goes on.
24780	27940	Tonight, we discuss an OG of PC gaming that continues this trend.
27940	30080	This is my leading commentary with no proper noun.
30080	33020	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about
33020	35840	the game and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where
35840	37380	every gamer has a voice.
37380	43540	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
43540	45660	where every gamer has a voice.
45660	52780	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 928 of our
52780	57840	show for tonight, August 28th of 2022.
57840	62680	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me on this program, as they always do, say hello
62680	65800	first and foremost to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
65800	70480	Hi, how are you doing?
70480	71920	I'm feeling better.
71920	78160	I went back to work, but I've had to leave early both days because my cough was kind
78160	82960	of bad and my throat hurt, but I'm getting better, staying longer, working through it.
82960	83960	There you go.
83960	86400	Well, I'm glad you're improving, even if not maybe at 100% yet.
86400	87960	I'm glad it's getting better.
87960	88960	That's good.
88960	89960	Yeah.
89960	94360	And I've found some extra supplements that have been helping with the brain fog, so that's
94360	95360	really good.
95360	96360	Oh, that is good.
96360	97360	So, okay.
97360	98360	Yeah.
98360	101800	I'll pass on more later, or if anyone wants to know.
101800	102800	Excellent.
102800	104520	Let's also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
104520	105520	Hello.
105520	106520	Hi, Loki.
106520	107520	How are you?
107520	108520	Okay.
108520	113040	So, I have to ask of this game that's playing behind you tonight, because this is not a
113040	114880	Mega Man game I recognize.
114880	118280	And actually, quickly, let me, of course, say for those on the podcast feed, I'm talking
118280	123440	about the video that we're seeing live at twitch.tv, because we do tape live every Sunday
123440	128440	night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash
128440	132520	VOG Network, or VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
132520	136440	And although it is Orange Lounge Radio and not Orange Lounge Video, once in a while,
136440	139880	I can't help but notice some things on video that I have to call out.
139880	144000	And one of these is this Mega Man game I don't recognize playing behind Loki tonight.
144000	145000	What's going on here?
145000	152360	So, this is a fan game, it's called Mega Man Ram, and it's by a guy called Jay Bit.
152360	153360	Okay.
153360	159840	Not to be confused with Mega Ran, the famous nerdy musician, rapper, individual, who I
159840	161400	think was on the show once a long time ago.
161400	162400	Like Nerdcore.
162400	163400	Yeah, like Nerdcore.
163400	164400	Yeah, I believe he was.
164400	165400	I think he was.
165400	166400	He was on the show a long time ago.
166400	167400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
167400	168400	A while ago, yeah.
168400	169400	Yeah.
169400	170400	So, well, I hope he's doing well.
170400	173360	Shout out to Mega Ran, who I think, I think, I could be wrong, but like me, will be at
173360	175600	Dragon Con this coming weekend.
175600	180600	So, for those that I have met at Dragon Con who might be hearing this episode, and it's
180600	185400	their first taste of OLR, hello and welcome, and hope you enjoy the show this week.
185400	191320	Myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki, we all met playing a little video game called Dance Dance
191320	192320	Revolution.
192320	194300	Yes, that infamous music game.
194300	199840	We met playing that game a long time ago, over 20 years ago, if you can believe it,
199840	201940	at Roseville Golf Land, playing that game.
201940	205220	And we thought, you know what, we love this so much, and we love getting together with
205220	208340	our friends afterwards, and just sitting around talking about video games.
208340	211220	We're going to start a show online where we talk about video games.
211220	215600	And here we are, all these years later, and we invite all of you to sit at the table with
215600	220960	us after gaming, after a long night of gaming every week, as we do here on Sunday night,
220960	223620	and invite you all to participate along with the show.
223620	228900	So there's our little reintroduction of the show, as we tend to do.
228900	235220	Coming to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network, thank you, Sean322 donated
235220	237660	some biddies because of the shout out to Mega Ran.
237660	241140	Well, unfortunately, Mega Ran doesn't get any of that money, so make sure you stream
241140	246060	the music, buy the album, make sure you support the talent that is Mega Ran.
246060	250140	And Dark Tetsuya says, speaking about the game playing behind Loki tonight, it didn't
250140	254700	look like Mega Man 9 or 10, so my first thought was some wild rom hack.
254700	259140	You know, I always underestimate, I don't, but it's one of those out of sight, out of
259140	260140	minds.
260140	263460	I always underestimate what the homebrew community can do.
263460	268340	Like, I don't, like the fact that a homebrew person made this doesn't surprise me at all,
268340	270700	but I just like, you know, it's kind of one of those out of sight, out of mind things.
270700	271700	You don't keep tabs on it.
271700	274700	It's like, whoa, whoa, somebody made like a complete Mega Man game from scratch?
274700	275820	Of course they did.
275820	276820	Of course they did.
276820	278380	It wasn't even a rom hack either.
278380	280380	So yeah, it's pretty cool.
280380	287620	So they made a Mega Man, they made a Mega Man PC game better than the Mega Man PC port.
287620	289620	I think, which of which I think there were two.
289620	291100	Did you, okay.
291100	294740	Did you ever play the original Mega Man PC that was like CGA graphics?
294740	296780	It was like three bosses.
296780	297780	I did.
297780	298780	I bought it at the store.
298780	301980	I think I must have bought it at the store, but no, it was not good.
301980	304340	It was like Volt Man was one of them.
304340	307060	There was, but yeah, it's like a long lost Mega Man game.
307060	309440	They had robot bosses that weren't in any of the other games.
309440	313220	So yeah, I think there are some that they actually did bring out to other games later
313220	314220	on.
314220	317660	Um, and also those bosses were featured in the comics too.
317660	318660	Yeah.
318660	321700	I know I've been really brushing up on my Mega Man since, you know, doing the Minecraft
321700	323700	stuff.
323700	324700	What's up with this?
324700	325700	You going on Mega Man Jeopardy?
325700	330060	Like what's, what's no, I'm, I've been in the Wiki a lot, a lot, a lot.
330060	335820	So like, you know, there's a lot of that stuff that I run into, but yeah, so there's, um,
335820	339820	yeah, there's some of the bosses that were in the PC one that actually ended up making
339820	343420	it to like the Archie comics or whatever, uh, which was pretty cool.
343420	348300	Um, and I think there was one guy though that was part of three that ended up getting remade
348300	352900	for another game later on, um, or in try and chat says those two dos games actually have
352900	354220	a pretty interesting history.
354220	355220	Yeah.
355220	358100	So you're not the only one that's spent many a night on Wikipedia or whatever, reading
358100	361580	about dos based Mega Man games that most people forgot about.
361580	363060	So love it.
363060	364060	All right.
364100	368060	Well, we didn't forget about, uh, lots of big announcements going on this week because
368060	373540	of Gamescom, which, um, did happen this week, uh, which is newsworthy in itself because
373540	378820	you know, E3, which is like the big thing that happens in the US every year hasn't really
378820	384900	happened for a little bit since COVID, um, came so, but Gamescom out in Germany and Europe,
384900	389500	it did happen this week and they did the, uh, what they split it up into like a business,
389500	393180	um, and, um, uh, public event, right?
393220	396020	They do like two days of business, three days public, something like that.
396020	401500	So they do like a combined thing and, uh, it all kicked off this week with some announcements
401500	408580	and the, I guess, should we call it much anticipated Jeff Keighley world premiere fest rollout
408580	411620	of Gamescom opening night world premiere.
411620	414460	I didn't get to watch it live because of the Europe timeframe.
414460	419580	It was like 11 AM for me and I have a lot going on at work right now.
419580	423060	So I can't like step away to watch something for God.
423060	425980	It was probably like two hours, so it was a long time.
425980	426980	So I got, it was a while.
426980	427980	Yeah.
427980	434980	There's no way I was a little behind to start it, but like I did skip around, um, a bit.
434980	438420	There's a few announcements like, eh, I don't care about that, but like there was a lot
438420	441540	of other things that were interesting, but they, I did, I did watch it.
441540	446660	Some might send my life to Jeff's credit and the whole production team, usually with his
446660	449740	friends, there's some things you're into and some things you're not.
449740	453220	And that's to be expected because he wants to reach a diverse player base.
453220	454220	Right?
454220	455220	So there's going to be a little bit of everything, right?
455220	456220	Yeah.
456220	459220	There's not, it's no, no big deal that like, you know, that stuff's in there.
459220	462740	I mean, there's, it was a lot of great games that were announced.
462740	465000	It wasn't anything like, Oh, that's super boring.
465000	468980	It's more of like, Hey, that looks cool, but I'm not gonna play that.
468980	471180	So let's talk about some of the things that were announced.
471180	472180	Let me start with this.
472180	476420	Cause I know you can run down the whole laundry list, but let me just kind of ask for you
476420	480660	and Jamie, if she has anything, but is there anything that like jumped out that you're
480660	486420	like, Oh, this is interesting to me or was it a surprise?
486420	493220	Surprise the Liza P was surprising as I, Oh, they're making that into a soul's like, okay,
493220	494220	cool.
494220	495220	It is.
495220	496980	It is weird that that's a soul's like, but artistically it does.
496980	498300	I think it looks cool.
498300	501940	I'm pissed off that Sonic frontiers in Japan gets a V tuber.
501940	502940	Really?
502940	503940	Yeah.
503940	505360	Um, not here.
505360	510560	They have a collaboration with like a pretty top of V tuber over there.
510560	511560	Huh?
511560	512560	Interesting.
512560	513560	I'll have to find the information.
513560	517600	I thought I was going to put it in show role and then I decided not to, but I'll, uh, I'll
517600	519080	see if I can find it.
519080	527120	The thing that I was most excited about that was, I should say surprising, um, ironically
527120	529560	enough is killer clowns from outer space.
529560	532800	He's so love that movie.
532800	535280	And so I'm super excited.
535280	537780	I have pretty decent coulrophobia.
537780	544280	So like even in dead by daylight, if I play clown, I, I put the chicken hat on him so
544280	545520	that he doesn't look like a clown.
545520	550160	I was just saying that that purple elephant thing is very, I don't have that cause it
550160	551560	costs dairy shards.
551560	557720	Oh, so I just put him in like a regular like red suit and the chicken hat.
557720	561920	Well, if, if this game comes out on PE, certainly you're not the only one in the world that
561920	563920	has an aversion to clowns.
563920	568240	And I, I, if this game ends up out on PC, I guarantee that's one of the first mods they're
568240	569240	going to make.
569240	573000	I don't know if it'll turn them into chickens, but something, something not really clowns.
573000	574000	Yeah.
574000	575000	They're aliens.
575000	576000	But anyway,
576000	580560	so I found, I found, uh, the thing, by the way, real quick about, uh, uh, Sonic frontier
580560	589520	in Japan, uh, the amazon.co.jp pre-order comes with a korone inugami, uh, collaboration,
589520	593440	which is basically, uh, the character in a vtuber outfit.
593440	601520	Um, and the DLC changes the sound effects to, uh, inugami's voice, uh, for geo that
601520	608760	is geo online or game dealer, um, an acrylic panel that has Sonic, uh, x korone inugami
608760	618320	collection illustration, uh, done by artist, uh, hookahire, um, for, uh, joshindenki.
618320	625400	It's uh, uh, korone inugami collaboration DLC, uh, gloves and shoes that Sonic gets
625400	626720	to wear.
626720	634880	And then there's, uh, for Rakuten, there is, uh, koroneski, which is, uh, it changes the
634880	644360	appearance of the Coco character to, uh, koroneski, which is like this kind of laughing head.
644360	652560	I'll put, I'll put the link in here for our, uh, our chat so they can, they can see, uh,
652560	653560	what those look like.
653560	657120	My curiosity has certainly peaked with, um, Sonic Frontiers.
657120	659720	Like I, I know there's a lot of people kind of dogging on the footage that we've seen
659720	662920	so far, but I'm, I'm, I'm open to it.
662920	670200	I, I'm, I, I, I've learned a long time ago to very much not read one way or two or another
670200	674320	too much into these types of previews for good, for better and for worse.
674320	680300	Um, so I, I just want to see, you know, nothing says it like just raw gameplay footage on
680300	681480	YouTube or Twitch.
681480	685240	And that's, you know, what ultimately is going to really, um, make my decision.
685240	686240	So I'm curious about it.
686240	690320	Well that said though, I have seen raw gameplay footage on YouTube and it looked very uninspiring
690320	694600	and boring, but like the whole thing too, like the art styles is very drab as well.
694600	698360	It's like, it screams default Unreal Engine game.
698360	701760	I mean, there's like no distinct art style to it.
701760	706840	Whereas like some of the other 3D Sonic games, even more recent ones are like very stylized
706840	707840	and stuff.
707840	708840	And I liked that.
708840	711640	I think they should be more stylized because right now it just looks so generic and bland.
711640	714400	It doesn't even look like a Sonic game.
714400	718920	So I mean, maybe it'll, maybe it'll pan out and be better, but like, it's just, it's not
718920	723920	leading off with a great, you know, great start.
723920	730160	And funny enough, like as of recently, a lot of these gut feelings that you get end up
730160	732080	holding true in the end.
732080	733600	So we'll see.
733600	738920	Um, before I mentioned the game that caught my attention, I wanted to go back quickly
738920	740760	to the last game we were talking about.
740760	743240	And sorry, Jamie, I know you're not a fan of the subject matter, but I want to focus
743240	747800	on the developers of that game because they made the Friday the 13th game.
747800	752640	And I always thought that game got a raw deal because that game could really be competing
752640	759000	in a sense with Dead by Daylight a little more if it hadn't just gotten destroyed by
759000	763080	trademark and licensing issues of the Friday the 13th franchise.
763080	769360	And ironically, I do think this whole story ends someday with a Friday the 13th chapter
769360	770520	for Dead by Daylight.
770520	771520	Absolutely.
771520	773020	But, but I digress.
773020	779520	The game that came out before that was interesting and was gosh, only about like four or five,
779520	782720	six months before the original Dead by Daylight.
782720	787040	So it did kind of beat DBD to the whole 4v1 thing, although it played very differently.
787040	788040	It was very different.
788040	792120	So I can't, you know, you can't draw a direct line between those two games, but you certainly
792120	794080	can see what they have in common.
794080	799400	So I'm just very curious, okay, if we're going with sci-fi camp now, so obviously, obviously
799400	804960	we can't do horror now because Dead by Daylight's got the lock and you know, all that, but now
804960	808720	to go sci-fi camp with this is, is interesting.
808720	812600	So I'm curious to see what the developers do from that standpoint, because Friday the
812600	814760	13th had a lot of good ideas in it.
814760	819140	So I'm, I'm curious to see if, if it's even the same type of game, it may not be, it may
819140	823360	just end up being a completely different thing, but it is an ace, was it, was it, I think
823360	826000	it's 4v1 on that, this one as well.
826000	828760	So it's, it'd be interesting, it's going to be interesting.
828760	829760	So we'll see.
829760	834560	Anyway, the game that also caught my attention, because literally I felt like this game came
834560	843760	out of nowhere, was Dead Island 2, because to put this into context, the last E3 I went
843760	848920	to, which I want to say was like 2014, I think was the last E3 I went to, I remember going
848920	853140	to behind closed doors to see where this game was at at the time.
853140	857740	So that was eight years ago that I saw that game.
857740	861200	And now like it, I honestly forgot about it.
861200	867240	I think most of us did outside of that Goat Simulator 3, you know, that, that whole thing,
867240	870560	which I maybe was intentional to kind of bring it back to the forefront of mind.
870560	871920	I don't know.
871920	876320	Outside of that, like I had not thought about Dead Island 2 for a long time.
876320	881520	And then all of a sudden, ta-da, it's here and it's dated and done.
881520	884300	And there's a part of me that goes, well, that's neat.
884300	888480	And there's also a part of me that goes, that, that could be really bad because I feel like
888480	892680	that's what happened with Duke Nukem Forever, is that Duke Nukem Forever was gone for a
892680	893680	long time.
893680	897000	And then all of a sudden it was like, it's happening, enjoy.
897000	898000	And nobody enjoyed.
898000	899000	It looks polished.
899000	902820	I mean, well, but here's, here's the other thing.
902820	905800	The original Dead Island game, and Bobby and I were just reminiscing about this on his
905800	908560	side, his show, the original Dead Island game.
908560	910240	I wasn't really a fan of that either.
910240	914040	Like I reviewed it for VOG Network and I do not remember giving it a good grade.
914040	918440	Um, no, no, no bikini torso pre-order bonus this time.
918440	921840	But I know it's comfort food for some people, that series.
921840	927040	Like it's, it's, I don't want to say it's trash because that gives a negative context.
927040	930960	But what if I said like, it's Sharknado of games?
930960	932960	Like there's a certain camp.
932960	936420	Yeah, but like, yeah.
936420	940140	But they're kind of like, see the thing with Dead Island though is even kind of annoying
940140	947620	is that it's basically taking the Dead Rising format and just kind of doing that, but first
947620	948620	person.
948620	950540	So I don't know.
950540	951540	It looks all right.
951540	955380	I like the idea of like seven different killers or whatever in there that you can play as,
955380	956380	but eh, whatever.
956380	957380	It's fine.
957380	962300	Uh, dark to see in chat says it does look like a stupid, fun, good time.
962300	966100	And I mean, shouldn't most video games be a little bit stupid?
966100	967900	No, I said most, not all.
967900	971700	There's certainly some, some artistic, you know, pushing forward the medium things and
971700	976380	there's a time and a place for that, but it's, it's okay for a video game to be stupid.
976380	978060	Like, you know, that's, that's okay too.
978060	981080	Just like movies, just like movies, right?
981080	983400	Sometimes you want to sit down and watch an Oscar winner.
983400	986060	Sometimes you want to watch something stupid and that's okay.
986060	990420	Like video games should, should follow that exact same thing for sure.
990420	992860	Pod Culture said, you say Sharknado like it's a bad thing.
992860	1000380	I wasn't saying it like it's a bad thing, but it, it, it fills a certain need in the
1000380	1004740	film industry that I would say Dead Island fills in the video game industry.
1004740	1010100	Well, I have to say there's exactly three games that grabbed my interest.
1010100	1011100	Okay.
1011100	1012100	What's that?
1012100	1013100	All right.
1013100	1018300	Well, number one, and I've talked about it before, Vikings on trampolines.
1018300	1020300	It's a concept.
1020660	1026860	Um, another one, just given my own kind of history interest is pentiment.
1026860	1029200	I'm really looking forward to that.
1029200	1033780	And uh, probably my very, very, very biggest, biggest, biggest thing that I super, super,
1033780	1041020	super, super, super want to play is uh, Lies of P.
1041020	1044860	That one, even though, even though that's a Souls-like.
1044860	1046160	Even though.
1046160	1048380	You know, you know what, Dark Soccer, this has been-
1048380	1051860	Just because it's like Souls doesn't mean it has to exactly be as hard as it.
1051860	1052860	You know what?
1052860	1053860	And you know what?
1053860	1057940	This, this is, this is the year to challenge our preconceived perceptions of games because
1057940	1061140	Dark Soccer, I remember when you wouldn't play first person games and then you were
1061140	1063060	a killer at Dead by Daylight for-
1063060	1065300	You know why I was a killer in Dead by Daylight?
1065300	1066300	I do.
1066300	1067300	I do.
1067300	1068300	But-
1068300	1071420	Because I thought the survivors had to do all kinds of crazy shit and it's true.
1071420	1076620	They have to do all kinds of crazy shit, but I thought that killer would be easier.
1076620	1081060	I also started as killer because I was like playing survivors too scary.
1081060	1085100	But when you're killer, I'm the one in control of the scare and it was, but then
1085100	1086100	I came around.
1086100	1087220	But anyway, that's not my point.
1087220	1090820	My point is we're all challenging our preconceived notions of games.
1090820	1091820	So why not?
1091820	1092820	Let's do a Souls-like.
1092820	1099460	It does look like, I got to say, like the artistic-ness of it, taking a Pinocchio-esque
1099460	1103420	type of thing and making it this is neat.
1103420	1108180	Like, you know, I'm more interested in this than the Tom Hanks live-action Pinocchio,
1108180	1109180	that's for sure.
1109180	1117460	Well, I mean, Callisto Protocol also is up on my list, you know, because I'm really interested
1117460	1120220	in seeing the mutation mechanic and what's going on.
1120220	1125620	I mean, Street Fighter 6 hopefully is better than Street Fighter 5, but, and I've already
1125620	1129940	been interested in Forspoken, even though I won't have any way to play it, but I'm really
1129940	1131300	also very interested though.
1131300	1137620	And I mentioned it was a pentiment because I follow a particular Twitter that's all about
1137620	1143220	badly drawn medieval animals, like how animals are drawn in medieval manuscripts and this
1143220	1149020	whole game looks like a medieval manuscript and I'm here for it.
1149020	1155020	Hey, sometimes it's just that little thing that jumps out at you and you're like, oh,
1155020	1156020	I got to, I got to see that.
1156020	1157020	I got to do that.
1157100	1160460	It's so, it's so just perfect.
1160460	1166660	Like I'm totally down for it, you know, with monks drawing and, and, you know, people doing
1166660	1171140	penance and it's just like, it's totally up my alley.
1171140	1176700	That and hearing about Kojima's podcast, I'm interested in that too.
1176700	1181880	associate100matt in chat says, Tom Hanks, all the things, here's, here's the thing.
1181880	1184180	It's not Tom Hanks that I have a problem with.
1184180	1187740	It's these live action Disney movies I have a problem with because none of them have been
1187740	1188740	good.
1188740	1190660	None of them have exceeded the original animation.
1190660	1191660	None of them.
1191660	1194940	I'm very concerned about the little mermaid and this has nothing to do with the casting
1194940	1195940	of Ariel.
1195940	1199220	I'm fine with that, but it does have everything to do with the casting of Ursula because it
1199220	1201860	should have been a drag queen, but I digress.
1201860	1202860	Fine.
1202860	1208140	Melissa McCarthy is close to a drag queen, but it's not going to be good.
1208140	1209380	It's not going to be good.
1209380	1210780	None of them have been good.
1210780	1212380	Aladdin was terrible.
1212380	1213380	Beauty and the Beast.
1213380	1215780	I almost walked out of that after the first 15 minutes.
1215780	1216780	It was so bad.
1216780	1217780	Lion King.
1217780	1218780	Not good.
1218780	1221600	Those Disney, none of those Disney live action remakes are good.
1221600	1222600	None of them.
1222600	1224700	So I don't know why this one's going to be any different.
1224700	1232420	Well, I mean, they did give you a drag, a fairy in the, uh, was it live action Pinocchio?
1232420	1235380	Oh, Oh, that's right.
1235380	1236380	That's right.
1236380	1237380	Who is playing it?
1237380	1238380	I don't know.
1238380	1240460	I forget, but it doesn't matter.
1240460	1241620	Wrong person asked about that.
1242220	1244000	It doesn't, you know, it doesn't matter.
1244000	1245260	It's still not going to be good.
1245260	1246260	It is.
1246260	1247260	It's so yeah.
1247260	1248260	Yeah.
1248260	1250740	It, that almost, no offense, but like, it seems almost pandering at that point.
1250740	1254180	It's like, well, let's just give them a reason to watch this because otherwise it's going
1254180	1255180	to be crap.
1255180	1256220	You know, like, I don't know.
1256220	1259700	It's um, bonds, double 06 says even Cruella.
1259700	1260700	Okay.
1260700	1261700	Technicality.
1261700	1262740	That wasn't a remake.
1262740	1268900	That was, that also wasn't just a certain like, and Glenn Close in 101 Dalmatians and
1268900	1273100	that movie, I don't throw in with this recent trend that was in the nineties.
1273100	1274100	Okay.
1274100	1275660	I'm talking about the more recent trend.
1275660	1281540	We'll, we'll forgive Glenn Close because she's Glenn Close and you know, Cruella was more
1281540	1286420	of an original story, but um, yeah, these other more modern remakes anyway, I digress.
1286420	1290460	We're talking about video games, but I get me started on Disney and I will go off on
1290460	1291460	Disney.
1291460	1292460	Okay.
1292460	1298100	Anyway, uh, Loki, um, I know dark soccer named a lot of stuff there.
1298140	1303340	I named, what else did we miss that we should talk about from the Gamescom opening ceremony?
1303340	1305340	I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff.
1305340	1309300	They have a new, they have a game coming out for Dune, Dune Awakening that looks pretty
1309300	1310300	awesome.
1310300	1311300	MMO, isn't it?
1311300	1312300	Yeah, it is.
1312300	1313300	And that could be interesting.
1313300	1314300	Yeah.
1314300	1319700	I'm just going to, if I made a character in that, she'd just sit around high on spice.
1319700	1323180	Her eyes glowing blue, staring vacantly out into the dirt.
1324060	1328420	Now I'm going to have to make a lady character in that game too, so that dark soccer and
1328420	1333740	I can have a Guild called the spice girls like, and I'm sure we're not the only ones
1333740	1338900	thinking this, but I'm hoping we're the first to say it on a podcast.
1338900	1344900	And so I'm going to say patent pending trademark, um, copyright names in the game have to be
1344900	1353140	like off-brand spice girl names, like, like you can be like pumpkin spice and, and I
1353140	1357380	can be, uh, we need a dude to be old spice.
1357380	1358380	I mean, okay.
1358380	1359380	Loki can be old spice.
1359380	1363620	Look, you'll be old spice and I'll be, I'll be pumpkin spice.
1363620	1367180	I'll be a spiced latte.
1367180	1369460	I was just, I was going to say sugar cake.
1369460	1370460	I'll be spice cake.
1370460	1371460	Okay.
1371460	1373660	How about spiced rum?
1374540	1375540	Yeah.
1375540	1376540	There you go.
1376540	1377540	I'll be spiced rum.
1377540	1380140	Sometimes your friends know you better than you know yourself.
1380140	1382180	Or I could be spicy snack.
1382180	1383180	There you go.
1383180	1384180	All right.
1384180	1386680	Who's in, who's in for our spice girls Guild.
1386680	1388460	Who's in a show of hands and chat.
1388460	1389460	Who's in, wow.
1389460	1390460	Nobody's talking.
1390460	1391460	What's good.
1391460	1392460	Is there, are we broadcasting?
1392460	1393460	Hello.
1393460	1394460	Hello.
1394460	1395460	Okay.
1395460	1399700	So pod culture has to be, um, 11 herbs and spices.
1399700	1400700	That's right.
1400740	1404700	There will be a character named herb and come up with, and then there will be 11 herbs in
1404700	1406180	the Guild and then spices.
1406180	1407180	Perfect.
1407180	1409180	It'd be in apostrophe spice.
1409180	1411140	All right.
1411140	1416820	Anyway, so yes, Dune is getting an MMO and now we're, we're going to make it ridiculous,
1416820	1419900	which again, video games can be stupid.
1419900	1423580	Lululemon is not fucking designer and you misspelled Chanel.
1423580	1424580	I'm just saying.
1424580	1428100	Levi's is also not designer.
1428100	1430380	I'm just saying.
1431380	1435860	You only, you only have a couple on there that are actually, and honestly, for, uh,
1435860	1441940	for Cruella, I got a little bit more from Sharperelli and maybe a hint of Valentino.
1441940	1443940	So just saying.
1443940	1444940	Okay.
1444940	1447420	This is a gaming podcast once in a while.
1447420	1449220	All right.
1449220	1450220	What else?
1450220	1457740	Hey, Hey, Sailor Moon's outfits in the anime were all based off of lots of fashion design
1457740	1459180	at the time in the nineties.
1459180	1464740	Let's talk about Sailor Moon for a minute.
1464740	1466940	And I had it.
1466940	1467940	No, I will leave.
1467940	1471580	I will leave all the talk about Sabin Sailor Moon to the experts at anime jam session.
1471580	1477540	So Dan and I actually talked about that this morning, just a little tangent.
1477540	1484620	I woke up this morning and I hear the Jason, the wield warriors theme song, and Dan was
1484620	1488980	on a kick of listening to eighties cartoon theme songs.
1488980	1493900	And we listened to pole position and, uh, the mysterious cities of gold.
1493900	1497540	And we're like, you know what, we can't enjoy this show anymore now that we're adults and
1497540	1498540	no history.
1498540	1509460	Um, but it was just like, and somehow we got on the topic of Sabin doing, uh, uh, um, the
1509460	1512700	Sailor Moon and we like, we're like, wasn't it Deke that did it?
1512700	1513700	Wasn't Sabin involved with Deke?
1513700	1514700	Was blah, blah, blah.
1514700	1515700	And went back and forth.
1515700	1519740	And that was like our whole discussion this morning whilst listening to the kid video
1519740	1520740	theme song.
1520740	1522340	Oh, you want a tangent?
1522340	1523340	You want a tangent honey?
1523340	1524340	One more.
1524340	1525340	I got a tangent for you.
1525340	1526340	Okay.
1526340	1527340	One more.
1527340	1528340	And then you can take the tangent.
1528340	1529340	All right.
1529340	1535380	So, um, in talking, uh, crap.
1535380	1539300	Now I forgot what I was going to say Bionic six was nineties.
1539300	1540300	Wasn't it?
1540300	1542620	Um, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.
1542620	1548460	I was going to say something about it now and I just, thanks, Rob.
1548460	1549460	I'm sorry.
1549460	1550460	Okay.
1550460	1553780	Do I, do I, do I get to do my piece now?
1553780	1554780	Fine.
1554780	1557500	And if I remember it halfway through what you're saying, I'll repeat it.
1557500	1558500	Okay.
1558500	1562220	So all aboard the tangent train, Rob Roberts conducting choo choo.
1562220	1563220	Here we go.
1563220	1564220	Okay.
1564220	1569500	So you were talking about eighties cartoons earlier this week, I got into a Twitter fight
1569500	1571220	with the County of Sacramento.
1571220	1574700	Yes, that is exactly what happened.
1574700	1579440	I got into a Twitter fight with the County of Sacramento, where we live.
1579440	1581660	And let me tell you a little bit about this fight.
1581660	1582660	Okay.
1582660	1583660	Here's what happened during this fight.
1583660	1590260	So I had a heart attack because they pushed an alert to everybody in Sacramento County
1590260	1596820	with this horrible noise, like the emergency alert noise, which I call the brown note.
1596820	1600980	I call the brown note because it makes you poop because it makes you sound like a tornado
1600980	1602260	is going off somewhere.
1602260	1603260	Okay.
1603260	1604260	Hold, I promised a tangent train.
1604260	1605620	I'm giving you a tangent train.
1605620	1611260	So I tweet and I say this fricking, I said the heart attack I just had with both my phones
1611260	1615180	making that hideous noise in unison, thanks a lot for the heads up.
1615180	1618700	And then I realized right after I wrote that, oh, I guess on their Twitter account, they
1618700	1620420	did give a heads up.
1620420	1625460	And then look at me being dragged and exposed by the County, that literally the County tweets
1625460	1632640	at me, give us a follow and avoid inconvenience in the future with the upside down smile emoji.
1632640	1639900	And so I, as, as one does, I replied with, I just write, I replied, drag me because I
1639900	1643980	drag me, expose me, make me write bad checks because that's drag.
1643980	1647860	I would have put drag me mommy, but I didn't want to assume the County's gender.
1647860	1649020	So I just put drag me.
1649020	1650020	Okay.
1650020	1651020	Cause that's, that's what I deserved.
1651020	1652020	All right.
1652020	1653020	So they replied-
1653020	1654020	I heard the light.
1654580	1657980	I heard it as eat me, beat me, make me write bad checks.
1657980	1662660	They replied with a GIF of Lilo and Stitch and Stitch getting dragged.
1662660	1669380	Travis Donovan from understation live jumps in and says, come on, Rob, I live 1,700 miles
1669380	1670380	away.
1670380	1674780	And even I knew it was coming with a GIF of GI Joe saying, knowing is half the battle
1674780	1678660	to which here we go tangent train about to reach his destination.
1678660	1681900	I replied saying, I never learned that lesson.
1681980	1686860	I was too busy watching Jem and the Holograms.
1686860	1688740	I want to point out who likes this tweet.
1688740	1690180	And I remember what I was going to say.
1690180	1691740	Who likes this tweet?
1691740	1692740	The County of Sacramento.
1692740	1693740	Okay.
1693740	1698580	So now I remember what I was going to say.
1698580	1703960	While we were listening, Dan had played the kid video thing, except it was like all instrumental.
1703960	1708140	So we were doing all of the lines back and forth from the other room.
1709140	1713060	We still remembered how the whole introduction to that show went.
1713060	1717060	That's not as funny as what you said, but it was a return.
1717060	1718060	No, it's fine.
1718060	1719700	Once you start a story, you have to finish it.
1719700	1720860	It's the rules of a party.
1720860	1722540	It is the rules.
1722540	1726820	Going to the chat, Tigerclaw in chat says, I guess that means they are Jem fans.
1726820	1730060	Well, Tigerclaw, anyone with taste would be.
1730060	1733860	She was just simply, she was just truly outrageous.
1733860	1737020	Truly, truly, truly outrageous.
1737020	1738900	And then Darktitsia says, I'm sorry.
1738900	1741180	That was totally worth retelling, right?
1741180	1745540	I want to give a big shout out again to everybody listening to OLR for the very first time.
1745540	1751300	Thanks to Dragon Con and the video game track panels I may have been moderating at the show.
1751300	1754300	Welcome to your video game three hour podcast.
1754300	1758820	And you might, you might've asked yourself before hitting subscribe, how, how do they
1758820	1763660	talk about video games for three hours on a podcast?
1763660	1764660	Gotcha bitch.
1764660	1765660	Okay.
1765660	1766660	Where were we?
1766660	1767660	Oh, yes.
1767660	1775660	Do you want to know how tangenty my brain works just for the record?
1775660	1779780	When y'all were talking about Tom Hanks, I had it in my head that he was in a movie about
1779780	1782780	a guy who is made socially invisible.
1782780	1786220	And it turned out it wasn't Tom Hanks in it at all, but I remember it being Tom Hanks.
1786220	1787220	It was some different guy.
1787220	1789820	And it was an episode of the Twilight Zone.
1789820	1796300	Like from God, the eighties or nineties, and it was called, uh, uh, to see the invisible
1796300	1797300	man.
1797300	1798660	I can't breathe.
1798660	1799660	Yeah.
1799660	1805620	I just went and looked all of that up while you were talking about Tom Hanks movies, because
1805620	1809860	that's where my brain went.
1809860	1818620	And if anybody has seen that episode of Twilight Zone, talk to me, I'm done.
1818620	1819620	What else is doing this?
1819620	1821340	The game's called Loki.
1821340	1825740	Um, well, Hammer, Return of the Monkey Island.
1825740	1830140	They had some more footage of that, including, uh, Dan.
1830140	1831140	I love Stan.
1831140	1832140	Stan's great.
1832140	1835860	They should make a whole game with Stan in it, but like, you know, I'll take this.
1835860	1836860	Um,
1836860	1837860	Hey, Loki.
1837860	1838860	What about recreation?
1838860	1839860	Recreation?
1839860	1840860	Yeah.
1840860	1846700	It's, uh, an open world racing game that lets you do like burnout shit.
1846700	1847700	Oh yeah.
1847700	1848700	That looks good.
1848700	1849700	W.R.E.T.
1849700	1850700	C.K.
1850700	1851700	Reation.
1851700	1856540	Oh, um, I don't remember that one, but yeah, that sounds cool.
1856540	1857940	I think we talked about that though.
1857940	1859260	Like a game called dredge.
1859260	1861740	And I wondered if, you know, the main character hidden lockers.
1861740	1867380	It might also be something that like, she's citing from like the floor at gamescom that
1867380	1868380	people are playing.
1868380	1869660	And that wasn't an opening night live.
1869660	1870660	Yeah.
1870660	1871660	I think it wasn't recreation.
1871660	1873580	The one that was like the old, uh, burnout devs and stuff like that.
1873580	1874580	I think it is them.
1874580	1875580	Yeah.
1875580	1876580	Yeah.
1877460	1879460	Cause I would have remembered that.
1879460	1882860	Um, but what else, uh, goat simulator three had a gameplay trailer.
1882860	1883860	Looks awesome.
1883860	1884860	Can't wait.
1884860	1891380	Um, they had, I think, uh, the outlast trials, uh, which is going to have a closed beta in
1891380	1892380	October.
1892380	1894380	Um, what is it?
1894380	1900900	A new trailer for Gotham nights, which would be out a little bit in October 21st.
1900900	1907460	Um, dying light two has some DLC coming that they showed off that kind of looked like thunder
1907460	1908460	dome.
1908460	1910460	So that's kind of neat.
1910460	1912340	Um, what else?
1912340	1918140	Um, I'm trying to think there was friends versus friends.
1918140	1920580	Oh, everywhere that looked interesting.
1920580	1928380	Like some sort of space survival game, um, more, uh, the Callisto protocol, I love all
1928380	1932380	the violence there and they, they always end it with the player getting killed in some
1932380	1933380	brutal way.
1933380	1939820	I love those that in the trailers, um, they have a telltale series for the expanse.
1939820	1942340	Oh yeah.
1942340	1947220	I have some friends that don't talk about gaming a lot, but like, well actually it's
1947220	1948220	my Ingers friends.
1948220	1950860	So they took, they do talk about that game, but they don't talk about like console games
1950860	1952580	a lot or PC games.
1952580	1956140	But there was a few of them that saw that expanse tell, and they were like, Oh, I'm
1956140	1957140	all about this.
1957140	1958620	Cause they, they love the show.
1958620	1959620	Yeah.
1959620	1965460	Uh, and then speaking of old telltale games, there is the new tales of the borderlands,
1965460	1972220	uh, or new tales from the borderlands, which cool.
1972220	1974180	Like it's neat.
1974180	1975180	I mean, I don't know.
1975180	1980420	I never played the original and kind of over board lands of it, but cool though.
1980420	1981420	Cause I,
1981420	1982580	but it was one of the better telltale games, believe it or not.
1982580	1984220	It was pretty good.
1984220	1985220	Yeah.
1985300	1987020	Uh, so that, that was neat, I guess.
1987020	1992660	And then what else, uh, I don't know.
1992660	1993660	There's a lot of other trailers.
1993660	1999780	So like, I know, like, um, they mentioned that Atlas fallen, which looks interesting.
1999780	2005340	It also kind of souls, like looking, uh, friends versus friends, which I'm not really sure
2005340	2010860	what that's supposed to be like, but just like a FPS cartoony looking game, uh, Lords
2010860	2011860	of fallen.
2012020	2016220	They have, uh, they're rebooting the hat, which I don't remember what that game was
2016220	2017220	like.
2017220	2023460	I don't think it's that old either that get the original came out in 2014.
2023460	2029300	So about the time they announced that I went to originally, yeah, pretty much a new pirate
2029300	2030300	game.
2030300	2032980	Tortuga, the pirate's tail or a pirate's tail.
2032980	2033980	I'm sorry.
2033980	2037780	I just realized that boss name in the mega man game playing behind you is creamery man.
2038300	2042020	I'm like, they're, they're really having to stretch for some new days.
2042020	2043020	Aren't they?
2043020	2048820	There's a lot of like interesting bosses.
2048820	2053060	I guess they probably tried to do creamy man and realize that probably is not the name
2053060	2054180	they should pick.
2054180	2058320	So they had to, it's all ice cream flavor or no, I guess it's very much like an ice
2058320	2063780	cream parlor type of thing, robot thing, but it's just, it's interesting how they decided
2063780	2070980	creamery man because creamy man might've, might've read wrong ice cream man, but yeah.
2070980	2071980	Anyway.
2071980	2072980	All right.
2072980	2073980	Gamescom.
2073980	2079920	And then of course the Pokemon car, you know, Pokemon car.
2079920	2080920	Because why not?
2080920	2081920	Why not?
2081920	2083960	We just talked about a car you're never going to own last week on the show.
2083960	2085460	Why not throw another one in?
2085460	2086460	Yeah.
2086460	2087460	Yeah.
2087460	2088460	All right.
2088460	2089460	Enough about gamescom.
2089460	2092460	I'm sure we will touch on more of these highlights as we move on throughout the show.
2092540	2097700	I will mention some comments from chat, uh, fifth dream talking about the Pokemon car
2097700	2098940	says I want that car.
2098940	2099940	Someone buy it for me.
2099940	2102340	Uh, SG100Matt says high on life.
2102340	2106900	The FPS from the minds of Rick and Morty creators talking weapons showed some gameplay.
2106900	2111020	This'll either be the most obnoxious game or quickly forgotten.
2111020	2113660	I'm strangely intrigued by it though.
2113660	2116540	So all right.
2116540	2120540	Pixel Pacas in chat says they call ice cream creameries in Vermont.
2120540	2123900	I mean, I've heard that used before.
2123900	2124900	Cold stone creamery.
2124900	2125900	Yeah.
2125900	2126900	Cold stone creamery is the thing.
2126900	2127900	Yeah.
2127900	2129660	And, and, uh, as a, who was it?
2129660	2132540	Evan back in the day would say leather boys.
2132540	2136500	Well, that's, that's very niche to NorCal too.
2136500	2137500	It's yeah.
2137500	2138500	Yeah.
2138500	2141900	Cause I say the first time I went back East, somebody was like, do you want to go to friendlies?
2141900	2143900	I was like, what's that?
2143900	2145260	That and they're like, it's, it's ice cream.
2145260	2146260	I'm like, what?
2146260	2147260	I've never heard it.
2147260	2148260	Cause I guess, you know, it's a huge thing.
2148260	2149260	Yeah.
2149260	2150260	Yeah.
2150260	2151260	They have one in the Bay area.
2151260	2153260	I thought that was the Bay area one.
2153260	2154260	No, no, no.
2154260	2155260	There was a different place.
2155260	2156700	No friendlies is like only like back East.
2156700	2158260	I'd never seen them here.
2158260	2159260	Yeah.
2159260	2160260	So anyway.
2160260	2161260	All right.
2161260	2165300	Jamie, Jamie, have you heard of a game called dinkum?
2165300	2166820	I don't know if it's on Mac yet.
2166820	2171780	I know it's on PC, but it's basically like animal crossing.
2171780	2173380	If we were to strip out the,
2173380	2181420	Yeah, I have heard of that, but it's not, it's like you're out living in the Outback
2181420	2182420	or something.
2182420	2183420	Kind of.
2183420	2184420	Yes.
2184420	2185420	Yes.
2185420	2186420	It is Australian.
2186420	2187420	All right.
2187420	2189500	Well, I want to get to our gaming weeks because I know dark soccer has been playing another
2189500	2194580	game that some have called the animal crossing inspired, but it's nothing animal crossing.
2194580	2195580	All right.
2195580	2196580	Yeah.
2196580	2198420	That was kind of what I got out of it too, but dark soccer wants to tell us about your
2198420	2200060	gaming week.
2200060	2202700	So I will start with the usuals.
2202700	2212460	I been playing final fantasy for, I just lost the twins last night, sad face.
2212460	2218820	Of course, dead by daylight, working through, trying to get my blood points saved up.
2218820	2223420	In fact, I need to actually just start holding onto them for the 30th for when I dish out
2223420	2231820	money for cosmetics and DLC for resident evil project W where we get Wesker as the bad guy,
2231820	2238540	which did I not say Wesker was going to be the killer on the last resident evil patch.
2238540	2239940	Remember I said that.
2239940	2242740	Well, yeah, I mean, there's only so many choices.
2242740	2243740	Yeah.
2243740	2250460	I knew it was either going to be him tyrant or, um, or nemesis.
2250460	2254940	And people were saying, Oh no, it's going to be, uh, Alexia code Veronica, blah, blah,
2254940	2255940	blah.
2255940	2256940	I'm like, no.
2256940	2259340	Um, but I knew it was going to be Wesker and Wesker did come out.
2259340	2260340	And so I was right.
2260340	2267380	And I called that shit and now we're getting Ada, Shiva, um, Carlos and Rebecca.
2267380	2270860	So I'm really, I'm really just jazzed about that.
2270860	2276100	Um, but I also played cult of the lamb.
2276100	2279820	I was going to stream for three hours that night.
2279820	2285180	I streamed for five, five hours.
2285180	2289900	I stopped at two 30 in the fucking morning.
2289900	2292020	It's addictive.
2292020	2297380	You don't say I'm not super great at the combat just because, you know, my, my wrist hurt.
2297380	2298500	I am playing on the controller.
2298500	2304540	It's actually really easy on a controller, but, um, it's so fun because like your fucking
2304540	2306780	people are demanding.
2306780	2311460	And um, I didn't have too many people, uh, watching while I was playing it just, you
2311460	2317640	know, in and out, but, uh, Finaro was my, uh, first cultist and her cultist ended up
2317640	2319940	like hating me and leaving.
2319940	2328460	Oh, so, uh, I will be playing this tomorrow night after, after work at eight Pacific time.
2328460	2334340	And I would love it if listeners would come in and be cultists.
2334340	2337100	You're literally asking the listeners to join your cult.
2337100	2339040	I'm asking the listeners to join my cult.
2339040	2346720	My cult is called the fantasy zone because of course it is, um, but I, um, I've got to
2346720	2353880	do a lot more just like farming for myself in the game so that I can get enough hearts
2353880	2357940	and whatnot to go fight the boss of the second stage.
2357940	2359200	So I'm getting into it.
2359200	2360800	I'm trying to get my people happy.
2360800	2367400	We already have the sacrifice, your cultists, um, we have the feast, we have a funeral.
2367400	2369440	My favorite is sacrificing somebody.
2369440	2370440	Okay.
2370440	2374400	So you come out and everyone's like, put those on their hoods and everything.
2374400	2376160	When you're in, you give your sermon, you do all that.
2376160	2381360	And then you do a ritual, which if you do sacrifice, they all, uh, throw on these hoods
2381360	2382960	and you don't know who it is.
2382960	2386960	And then when you pick the person, they throw off their hood with a big old grin on their
2386960	2390360	face and everyone's like, yay, stab.
2390360	2392880	And they're like, yay.
2392880	2404360	It might be like that South Park episode, Oh God, Woodling Critter, Christmas type thing.
2404360	2406520	I absolutely love it.
2406520	2416200	And um, and I actually managed to get into my Dead by Daylight account on Steam and all
2416200	2424120	of my, uh, progress that I made on, um, on Stadia, like my achievements there, none of
2424120	2431960	them came over, except for like the, the P 50 one did before.
2431960	2440520	Um, and my level ones, but I, I fully thought that all of my achievements from Stadia would
2440520	2441520	carry over.
2441520	2447280	Cosmetics did, oddly enough, my, my, while my eerie shards and my blood points carried
2447280	2452480	over my RX cells did not.
2452480	2460380	So I will be staying on Stadia for the foreseeable future, but the way that I accessed it was
2460380	2465480	through, um, the Nvidia thing.
2465480	2470240	I have to say it does not look good through Nvidia.
2470240	2477560	It does not it's, it's fuzzy and a little pixely whereas, I mean, and again, it could
2477560	2485480	be a thing because I'm on Stadia pro, but my, my graphics on Stadia pro are like ultra
2485480	2486480	and it's beautiful.
2486480	2487480	So interesting.
2487480	2488480	Yeah.
2488480	2489480	So there's, there's that.
2489480	2490480	Um, so, okay.
2490480	2491480	All right.
2491480	2498960	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, I will toss it over to Loki.
2498960	2499960	How was your gaming week?
2500680	2504400	Well, I played things other than Minecraft.
2504400	2505400	You did it.
2505400	2506400	Oh yeah.
2506400	2507400	Oh yes.
2507400	2508400	Oh yes.
2508400	2510600	I've been waiting all week to ask you about a particular game that came out this week
2510600	2512600	because I've seen the tweets.
2512600	2520760	So I, I, I played, uh, when I played Minecraft, I played, um, some fashion police squad, um,
2520760	2526840	in the process of debugging stuff from the other game, which I played, which was saints
2526840	2527840	row.
2528080	2532640	So it hasn't been good.
2532640	2540680	Um, the saints row, like if you've seen any of the reviews, it's an incredibly buggy and
2540680	2542760	under polished game.
2542760	2544980	It's just, it's really bad.
2544980	2549060	Like to a point where it's not, not like funny, bad.
2549060	2551480	It's like bad, broken, bad.
2551480	2557360	And so that aside, because I haven't, didn't really hit any tech, my heart, one technical
2557360	2563440	hurdle I hit was that trying to play the game with my wireless controller.
2563440	2566280	Um, the controls aren't mapped correctly.
2566280	2569120	So not that like it wasn't mapped correctly.
2569120	2574280	Like I had the re configure my controller that the button prompts were incorrect.
2574280	2578800	So it read, you know, like I was pushing the a button and read that as the B button B was
2578800	2587320	X, X was a, um, the directional, the analog stick was the wrong analog stick and it was
2587320	2588320	inversed.
2588320	2592480	Um, the right trigger was start.
2592480	2599200	So it was all fucked up, basically, um, plugging it in, solve that problem and fixed it now,
2599200	2600880	which I don't understand.
2600880	2604920	If I go into steam with a wireless controller, it plays just fine.
2604920	2608160	It doesn't give a crap if it's plugged in or wireless because it's a competent piece
2608160	2614280	of software, saints rose, fucking bullshit, but the technical stuff aside, let's talk
2614280	2616120	about the writing.
2616120	2623240	They have somehow by like some sheer ineptitude, have found a way to make you actually hate
2623240	2624720	your main character.
2624720	2628320	Like you see your main character acting out stuff in the thing.
2628320	2632520	It's like, Holy shit, I hate this person and this is the person that I'm playing it.
2632520	2636240	I don't want to play as this person because this person is a fucking idiot.
2636240	2640920	And so that, that is the start of the, the game itself.
2640920	2643800	Not to mention that the gameplay is kind of meh as it is.
2643840	2649240	I actually, this game made me like Saints Row 4 better and Saints Row 4 wasn't great.
2649240	2652360	I mean, like, it's just, it's so awful.
2652360	2654720	Like the characters are so goddamn awful.
2654720	2655960	I don't like any of them.
2655960	2657080	I hate all of them.
2657080	2662080	It hasn't gotten any better since they initially showed them they are awful characters.
2662080	2663660	They are not the saints.
2663660	2666760	I don't give a shit if this is a reboot and they're forming the saints.
2666760	2668440	They're fucking idiots.
2668440	2670400	You reject, you reject this game.
2670400	2671560	They're seriously idiots.
2671760	2673640	Let's talk about the original Saints Row.
2673640	2675840	It's the original Saints Row they were gang bangers.
2675840	2680840	Like each person in the gang, like was,
2680880	2684360	they have their own personalities, but they were ruthless people.
2684360	2686680	They were just like, you know what?
2686680	2688240	I don't take shit from anybody.
2688240	2689320	And that's what it was.
2689320	2691240	That's what the game's supposed to make you feel like.
2691240	2693240	Like, I don't take shit from anybody.
2693240	2695000	I'm going to go fuck these other gangs up.
2695000	2697320	That's how you're supposed to feel playing Saints Row.
2697320	2699520	This shit is fucking awful.
2699520	2704520	It's just like, oh, oh, we don't have enough money to make our rent.
2705240	2708240	Oh, well, let's go knock off a payday loans place.
2708240	2709000	Okay, cool.
2709000	2713040	Now we could go buy, I want to buy a $300 waffle maker.
2713040	2715600	Cause I really like waffles.
2715600	2717480	Waffles are pretty good, Loki.
2717480	2719240	What the fuck is this shit?
2719240	2720960	Like it's so stupid.
2720960	2722080	So I was going to ask you,
2722080	2723640	and you're already kind of answering this,
2723640	2726160	cause I was going to ask you, where did this game go wrong?
2726160	2727720	What was the misstep they made along the way?
2727720	2732760	And it really sounds like you're kind of saying is that this whole idea to make like the,
2732760	2738520	the, the tone of the game different is just like, it's just, it's, it's wrong from the start.
2738520	2739520	It's what it is.
2739520	2746440	What it is is that they're just trying to inject like modern day, like kind of scenarios, I guess,
2746440	2752080	into it sort of like where it's like, okay, hey, capitalism is bad and we're in a recession.
2752080	2757000	Oh, I was gonna say, I was gonna say modern day DLC techniques is what they're injecting into it.
2757000	2759120	Oh, oh, oh no, hold on.
2759120	2760120	Hold on.
2760120	2761120	Yeah.
2761120	2762120	Yes.
2762120	2763120	There is some bullshit.
2763120	2764120	Okay.
2764120	2768320	So there's, there's some jokes that they try to pull off in this game.
2768320	2772200	Jokes that are just like, take a look in the mirror.
2772200	2773200	You fucking idiot.
2773200	2779320	It's like, seriously, they have a joke about like DLC that, Oh, Hey, Oh yeah.
2779320	2782440	That piece of armor is going to cost two 99.
2782440	2784120	They're like, ha ha ha funny.
2784120	2786440	Cause DLC is like a thing.
2786440	2788640	Have you looked at your previous games?
2788640	2791200	They were so fucking ridden with DLC.
2791200	2792360	It was ridiculous.
2792360	2794920	Like all of the Cosmex were nickel and dive.
2794920	2798840	Go on steam right now and go buy their fucking game and see how much fucking DLC there was
2798840	2799840	for it.
2799840	2804740	It is so goddamn stupid that they would even try to, why even try to poke fun at that?
2804740	2808200	And then on top of all that, then they make the fucking joke of like the Todd Howard,
2808200	2809600	it just works bullshit.
2809600	2810600	Yeah.
2810600	2813440	Like you should fucking talk with your bug free fucking game.
2813440	2817200	Like God forbid, but that's at least has a fucking entertaining game after all of those
2817200	2818200	fucking bugs.
2818200	2822440	But you, all you have is fucking shitty ass saints were reboot is what you got.
2822440	2824100	And what's that going to fucking give you?
2824100	2827960	No one gets a shit about your game and all your fucking like, Oh, we've heard the feedback
2827960	2828960	in summer.
2828960	2829960	You are having problems.
2829960	2830960	Bullshit.
2830960	2831960	No.
2831960	2832960	Some of us are having problems.
2832960	2836200	Everybody's fucking having problems with your broken ass piece of shit game that we've told
2836200	2841040	you from the outset is going to be shit because of the, your fucking characters that nobody
2841040	2842040	liked.
2842040	2843040	And did you fucking listen?
2843040	2844040	Cause you didn't fucking listen.
2844040	2846600	Now you have fucking ugly Sonic running up in this shit.
2846600	2850280	And then you're wondering why no one wants to fucking watch your goddamn movie.
2850280	2851280	That's wise.
2851280	2853000	Cause you didn't fucking listen to those stupid fans.
2853000	2855960	Who were the people who are going to buy your goddamn game in the first place?
2855960	2857560	Who are you going to fucking sell this to?
2857560	2859560	People have never heard of fucking saints row.
2859560	2863400	You're you're targeting it towards people that are going to buy the franchise.
2863400	2866420	Like you got to make it appeal to the people that play the old game.
2866420	2868760	And I get it that it's too fucking sensitive.
2868760	2872160	Now they have fucking strippers and big dicks fucking running around.
2872160	2873280	You know what?
2873280	2874480	It's a fucking game.
2874480	2878280	And you know, sometimes it's fine to be a little bit offensive about that shit.
2878280	2882960	Like get over your fucking self with your stupid ass game.
2882960	2883960	That's it.
2883960	2887440	I got to try to play a little bit longer and to least give it a chance, but it's awful.
2887440	2888440	It's really awful.
2888440	2890440	I don't want to play it anymore.
2890440	2894840	That fashion police spot said, seriously, that game is a fucking fantastic.
2894840	2898760	I can't wait to play after the show.
2898760	2899920	I am not going to play that game.
2899920	2903260	Like seriously is just, it is so disappointing.
2903260	2906020	Like I am so fucking disappointed with this shit.
2906020	2908520	Like so long we wanted a new saints row game.
2908520	2913040	And this is the fucking shit that they pull out and the fucking nerve of them just to
2913040	2916960	think that like, let's be honest, their writing has not been good.
2916960	2917960	Okay.
2917960	2918960	They killed off Gat in the third game.
2918960	2923120	They thought that was fucking genius writing of them and then everybody was fucking pissed
2923120	2924120	off at them.
2924120	2925240	They were fucking pissed off.
2925240	2927200	So they, Oh, he didn't die.
2927200	2929040	He got abducted by aliens.
2929040	2931520	That was the plan all along bull fucking shit.
2931520	2934760	It was the plan you fucked up and you had the retcon that shit.
2934760	2936980	So you know what you fucking need retcon all of this shit.
2936980	2938680	This game does not fucking exist.
2938680	2939680	Okay.
2939680	2940680	That's how it is.
2940680	2944200	You could have made a whole reboot with the original characters and it would have been
2944200	2949300	fucking in Canon because that was one of the endings in got out of hell.
2949300	2950660	You could have made a new game.
2950660	2952980	You don't ask Jamie Lee Curtis.
2952980	2957100	You don't have to explain if you just want to go back and do a new sequel.
2957620	2961380	If you're Jamie Lee Curtis, you don't owe anybody a fucking thing.
2961380	2962980	You don't owe anyone an explanation.
2962980	2963980	And you know what?
2963980	2965640	You will be number one at the box office.
2965640	2970160	So you can, yeah, you could just pull a fucking final fantasy seven reboot thing.
2970160	2973380	Like you have the same characters, but different shit can go down.
2973380	2974580	That's all you have to fucking do.
2974580	2979460	Like it's not a hard thing to do volition, but you know, because of this, we're never
2979460	2982460	going to get a fucking Saints Row game again.
2982460	2983460	That's why you're mad.
2983460	2984460	This is so bad.
2984500	2987300	It's a franchise killer because, because they fuck this shit up.
2987300	2989020	They fuck this shit up so much.
2989020	2993700	So often, like they tried the spinoff was an agents of mayhem or whatever that bullshit
2993700	2994700	was.
2994700	2996760	And then nobody wanted to play it because it wasn't a Saints Row game.
2996760	3001280	So then they are all, Oh, Hey, here's some, we're going to put Johnny Gad in it now.
3001280	3002280	Just like this one.
3002280	3004900	They're like, Oh, it doesn't tie in with the original saints at all, but Oh, but you can
3004900	3007160	buy a Johnny Gad shirt.
3007160	3008160	Fuck them.
3008160	3009360	I'm so sick of their shit.
3012360	3012860	That's it.
3012860	3013360	We're done.
3014460	3019660	But other than that, Loki, how was the play anyway?
3019660	3021920	Yeah, but fashion police squad is awesome.
3021920	3025460	It's a great, like quick, like, or not quickly, I guess it's sort of like quake.
3025460	3030220	It's pretty fast paced and stuff and it's, it's silly and it's got like a, it's got a
3030220	3034740	lot of humor in it and I really think it's worth the play, but yeah, I say it's row.
3034740	3039140	If you really are interested in it, just wait for a deep discount and wait for a long time
3039140	3041900	because it's going to take them a ton of time to patch this stuff.
3041940	3044660	It'll be free on the Epic game store in a year.
3044660	3048220	It's, it's so unacceptable in the, in the state that it is right now.
3048220	3051660	It is just absolutely awful.
3051660	3053980	Like even people have reviewed it on console and stuff.
3053980	3058060	They said it's crashed a console like numerous times just trying to play this game.
3058060	3060100	Like it shouldn't be this bad.
3060100	3064540	Like technically is just all messed up and they clearly rushed it out.
3064540	3069100	Uh, bonds, double a six and chat says Loki woke up and chose scorched earth.
3069100	3070100	Yep.
3070180	3073620	You know, sometimes, sometimes you're really disappointed in a video game.
3073620	3074620	All right.
3074620	3076340	Uh, let's see my gaming week.
3076340	3078460	I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed to follow that.
3078460	3083340	Uh, I played more Final Fantasy 14, which got a new patch this week, uh, which, uh,
3083340	3084340	extended the story.
3084340	3087060	They've got a really cool new character in it and I'm really interested to see where
3087060	3088060	they go with it.
3088060	3089220	I really liked the new dungeon.
3089220	3094100	I really, really liked the Final Fantasy four references because I'll just say it at this
3094100	3095100	point.
3095100	3097900	If you're a Final Fantasy 14 fan, you've already played it at this point.
3097900	3102540	Um, it is now obvious we are fighting the four fiends, uh, in this con because we have
3102540	3104740	now fought in this, uh, patch.
3104740	3108980	You fight two of them, uh, you fight Scarmiglione and you fight, uh, Barbariccia.
3108980	3111940	So, uh, Barbariccia is the trial and it's, it's a good trial.
3111940	3116340	So, uh, and the Scarmiglione is the dungeon boss and, uh, it's all done very well.
3116340	3122220	So I can't wait for us to do, uh, Cogzano and, um, Rubicant, uh, Rubicant I'm sure will
3122220	3125860	be the last one that they do because, you know, that's a, that's a huge, uh, uh, boss
3125860	3126860	fight.
3126860	3128340	I love that they're kind of like tying it.
3128340	3132660	It's not directly Final Fantasy four, but it's like, I feel like it's like an alternate
3132660	3133980	universe type of thing.
3133980	3135900	Uh, and the story is great.
3135900	3140240	And this patch gave us the Island Sanctuary expansion.
3140240	3143060	So now they're, and they're calling it animal crossing mode.
3143060	3147100	Mm, I wouldn't go to, I think they want to label anything that's like a farm sim animal
3147100	3148100	crossing.
3148100	3152700	I wouldn't call it that, but it is a nice relaxing little like gather and have critters
3152700	3154500	and veg and plants.
3154500	3160340	And since it's, and they built it kind of smart so that you can't just hammer it all
3160340	3161620	out in a night.
3161620	3162620	People tried.
3162620	3168820	I mean, I guess you can, if you're really, really dedicated, but I think the developers
3168820	3170140	are trying to make it very clear.
3170140	3171140	There's no need to be.
3171140	3174340	Um, so, uh, yeah, I, I like what they've done with the Island Sanctuary.
3174340	3179660	I think it's a pretty cool little feature, um, other games I've played this week.
3179660	3186780	I played, um, Diablo three this weekend, a lot, a lot, um, what's that you and Alan
3186780	3187780	playing together?
3187780	3188780	Yep.
3188780	3191180	Alan, I've been playing, I, I helped power level him.
3191180	3198100	So uh, yeah, we've been playing, uh, I, uh, I'm up to about Paragon 150 now.
3198100	3201140	So and that's the season started on Friday.
3201140	3202260	So I've been playing a lot.
3202260	3208740	I tried to play Pokemon go yesterday because, uh, yesterday was the big finale of Pokemon
3208740	3211220	go Fest and I was all jazzed to do it.
3211220	3214860	I went downtown and I started what, but it was too hot.
3214860	3216820	It was too hot.
3216820	3220020	And it's not the degree, like it was a hundred degree day.
3220020	3225060	We've had worse, but it's just the sun bearing down on you while you're trying to walk around
3225060	3227820	and find groups to raid with and stuff was just too much.
3227820	3234180	I didn't realize you could get these new, uh, wild beasts, what the hell are they called?
3234180	3236660	The wormhole, ultra beasts, whatever they are.
3236660	3237660	Sorry.
3237660	3238660	I forget all the names.
3238660	3241660	I did not realize you could get them through quests.
3241660	3242660	Thank you.
3242660	3243660	Ultra beasts.
3243660	3244780	I thought you had to raid for them.
3244780	3248000	And I was getting really irritated when I was joining raids and like, no one else is
3248000	3249000	in the area doing it.
3249000	3251940	I'm like, Oh my God, I'm going to be stuck out here.
3251940	3253820	But then I found out, Oh, you get them.
3253820	3254820	Thanks to S.J.
3254820	3255820	100 Matt sending me a tweet.
3255820	3257240	He's like, Oh no, you'll get them through the quests.
3257240	3258240	Don't stress about it.
3258240	3261340	I was like, Oh, Oh, okay.
3261340	3264220	Well I guess I could have done this whole thing in my car or I could have gone to the
3264220	3266660	mall that's indoors.
3266660	3270680	But at that point I was like, eh, I want to just play Diablo.
3270680	3275680	So I got three shinies, three, but I got the unknown I needed that I didn't have yet.
3275680	3277820	I think X and P were the new letters for me.
3277820	3280460	And I got those and I was happy with that to be honest.
3280460	3282340	So that's fine.
3282340	3283780	I had a, I had an okay day.
3283780	3286540	I got a shiny carob blast.
3286540	3287700	Is that the name?
3287700	3291980	It's instead of a dark blue, it's like an Aqua color, which I really like.
3291980	3294080	And I got the shiny costume Pikachu.
3294080	3297320	And those are usually pretty rare because they're only available for like a day or two.
3297320	3299460	So that was, that was cool.
3299460	3304160	So that was pretty much my gaming week.
3304160	3306220	That's that's, that's really, that's really it.
3306220	3309020	There was some other stuff too, but yeah, I'll, I'll talk about it another time.
3309020	3315500	So why don't we get into housekeeping real quick?
3315500	3316780	No show next week.
3316780	3317780	I'm not here.
3317780	3318780	I'm going to be at Dragon Con.
3318780	3319780	I've said that a million times.
3319780	3321220	I'm not going to go over my schedule again.
3321220	3325300	You can check out last week's show or look for me in the app, Rob Roberts.
3325300	3329860	I have three panels on video gaming, two on digital media, one on the horror tracks.
3329860	3331660	I have six panels in all this year.
3331660	3335120	And if you're going to be in the area, I'd love to meet people that listen to the show.
3335120	3338960	I've had people come up to me after a panel and say, I've been listening for years and
3338960	3340060	I just wanted to say hi.
3340060	3343100	And that that's such a compliment and I really appreciate it.
3343100	3348780	So please, yeah, if you're going to be at Dragon Con, please don't hesitate to say hi.
3348780	3351500	And yeah, that's, that's everything I can think of at the moment.
3351500	3354020	So we won't be here live, but we'll be back in two weeks.
3354020	3357740	But I hope everybody has a fabulous Labor Day, uh, with whatever it is you're going
3357740	3358740	to be doing this weekend.
3358740	3362560	There's a lot of conventions going on here, here locally, SacAnime is always a thing that
3362560	3363560	weekend.
3363560	3366020	Um, what else is Labor Day weekend?
3366020	3373140	There's another big convention I'm, is PAX, PAX, hello, PAX West is this weekend, right?
3373140	3376860	So that's, that's the other big thing I was like, what is the other big thing on Labor
3376860	3378980	Day that I always, oh yeah, it's PAX.
3378980	3380400	So that's happening.
3380400	3381820	So that'll be fun too.
3381820	3384260	All right, uh, let's move on.
3384260	3387180	Let's get into some gaming news and talk about some other video games stuff that's been going
3387180	3388740	on around the globe.
3388740	3390380	Loki, we'll start with you.
3390380	3394980	Our Discord's been chatting about this one over at vog network.com slash Discord.
3394980	3397740	Our Orange House Radio chat has been going off on this.
3397740	3399800	So much shocking turn of events.
3399800	3405660	Sony has decided to raise the price of the PlayStation 5, taking a, taking a page out
3405660	3407820	of the meta book there.
3407820	3414080	Um, they have said that challenging economic conditions, um, have cost the component prices
3414080	3415080	that go up.
3415080	3420060	And so in sense, they're going to raise the price in most markets.
3420060	3423660	The U S seems to be the only exception at the moment.
3423660	3429740	Um, but right now, like for example, uh, the PlayStation 5 or the PlayStation 5 with disk
3429740	3436460	drive in Lake Europe is going to be, uh, five 49 99 and the digital edition being four
3436460	3438500	49 99.
3438500	3443420	Um, in the EU, it's going up from 500 to five 50.
3443420	3454140	Um, we have in Australia now seven 50 to 800 and even in Mexico, uh, going from, uh, looks
3454140	3465740	like 14,999 or eight with the, uh, Blu-ray drive and 12,499, uh, for the digital edition.
3465740	3469900	Mike, Mike Deft, who is in Mexico had a few things to say about this on Discord and it
3469900	3473220	has a few more things to say in our chat right now.
3473220	3475300	So it's not happy about it.
3475300	3481380	And that means just to stress, uh, it is not going up in the U S this is pretty much all
3481380	3483260	these other places, but not the U S.
3483260	3484660	So interesting.
3484660	3486780	It is interesting that they're doing that.
3486780	3493500	Um, now Microsoft and Nintendo have said that they're not planning on, um, Raising prices
3493500	3494820	at this time.
3494820	3499140	So Microsoft came out and said, we're constantly evaluating our business to offer our fans
3499140	3501880	great gaming options are okay.
3501880	3505540	So basically they said that I don't want to read all the PR speak, but it's basically
3505540	3508380	saying that the prices are going to stay the same.
3508380	3515740	Um, and then for Nintendo, they're saying they're not considering a switch price increase.
3515740	3516860	That's probably for the best.
3516860	3517860	Yeah.
3517860	3519860	I mean, it's fine.
3519860	3526500	Like, I, I'm surprised that they're doing that, like, cause I don't think that they're
3526500	3530940	selling a ton of consoles in the mile of money that they, they don't make any thought of
3530940	3534580	those consoles anyways, but I don't think they're losing a ton either.
3534580	3538340	I don't know, but we'll see how that works out for them.
3538340	3541980	I guess they're thinking right now because the shortages, it's still going to be in high
3541980	3546220	demand, but it's like, you know, hopefully they're not thinking, well, scalpers could
3546220	3547220	get that kind of money.
3547220	3551300	So let's see if we can get that kind of money.
3551300	3554300	It's just going to make the scalpers bring it up even higher.
3554300	3555300	Yeah.
3555300	3559420	I, it doesn't that feel a little bit like what Disneyland's doing.
3559420	3564140	Let's raise the price so high that only the really rich people come and we don't have
3564140	3566100	pass holders anymore.
3566100	3571500	Like I, I, it just feels a little bit like that to me in a way, but you got it.
3571500	3574900	You got to cater to your whales is what you're probably thinking.
3574900	3575900	I guess so.
3575900	3581100	Well, I, uh, I shudder to see what this little device is going to cost, but we know that
3581100	3585900	the PlayStation VR two is apparently going to launch in early 2023.
3585900	3587940	Uh, that is all we got.
3587940	3593820	And I think this came from a tweet, uh, that like, uh, PlayStation France or something
3593820	3595220	kind of first put out there.
3595220	3599060	Uh, we don't know, like anything else, we don't know price, we don't know the actual
3599060	3600060	date or whatever.
3600060	3604820	I would assume that they're going to get it out before the fiscal year is over.
3604820	3608980	Cause usually when something is early 2023, especially a piece of hardware, that's what
3608980	3609980	they're aiming for.
3609980	3615540	Um, this would not be completely unhinged for new hardware to come out in the beginning
3615540	3616540	of the year.
3616540	3621660	Um, Nintendo changed that game when they released the switch, uh, in March, right.
3621660	3626460	And, uh, showed that you don't have to release a new console, uh, around the holidays, technically
3626460	3632480	the PS VR two is not a new console, but it might as well be, uh, you know, it's a, certainly
3632480	3639060	a high cost expansion for an existing console, but, uh, I love original PlayStation VR for
3639060	3640060	the PS four.
3640060	3644460	Uh, so I'm totally all about, you know, if the right games are out, I will totally get
3644460	3647020	a VR two for the PlayStation five.
3647020	3651180	I don't know what game is the must have app for this right now.
3651180	3654060	I'm sure they're going to port Beat Saber.
3654060	3655060	No man's sky.
3655060	3656060	We already know is getting ported.
3656060	3659220	I'm well, actually would they port Beat Saber now?
3659220	3661880	Cause didn't meta pick up the studio that has that.
3661880	3662880	So maybe, I don't know.
3662880	3667140	I think they'd be fools not to, but I guess that's maybe not such a sure thing.
3667140	3675200	So I'll be very curious to see what must have games come out, but I guess that horizon spin-off
3675200	3676200	looked kind of neat.
3676200	3679380	I guess, I guess Sony's trying to do their own things in house.
3679380	3680380	We'll see.
3680620	3688020	So, uh, more to come on that, uh, Bobby Black Wolf clarifying in chat, meta said they would
3688020	3694580	keep Beat Saber multi-platform well, you know, I don't doubt that, but I doubted a little
3694580	3700940	bit from them because, you know, Microsoft kind of also has played the wishy-washy we're
3700940	3706300	going to keep things multi-platform, but then, but not everything, you know, so they can
3706300	3710580	always, my point is they can always go back on their word and there's really nothing that
3710580	3714900	anybody can do about it, but I do think it's in their best interest to keep a multi-platform.
3714900	3722340	Um, also meta sucks, but it sucks just a little bit less thanks to the changes they made where
3722340	3725820	you finally don't have to have a Facebook account linked to your, uh, meta thing anymore.
3725820	3728380	So that's kind of nice, I guess.
3728380	3729380	Yeah.
3729380	3734540	All right, let's move on a completely different topic, uh, Dark Sakura.
3734780	3740700	So, um, yeah, I brought up some Resident Evil stuff earlier, but what I did not bring up
3740700	3746260	was Resident Evil on Netflix, which honestly I had completely forgotten existed.
3746260	3751940	Um, and apparently a lot of other people forgot it existed or didn't really care for it, um,
3751940	3754420	because it's being canceled.
3754420	3760060	From what I understand, most people that remembered it existed wishes, wishes they hadn't.
3760140	3761140	Hmm.
3761140	3770340	Well, um, it is, uh, there's not going to be a season two, even though there were thoughts
3770340	3776700	that there could be something better that came from it, um, but at any rate, um, it's
3776700	3778580	not getting a second season.
3778580	3781780	The story wasn't very well suited.
3781780	3783580	It didn't really follow very well.
3783620	3790820	Um, it had some weird narrative framing for jumping between timelines.
3790820	3796620	Um, yeah, they're, they're just, it's no.
3796620	3800060	I mean, the actors in it were apparently really great.
3800060	3806420	Um, but it just suffered from really bad writing and a convoluted plot.
3806420	3812540	And let's, let's also not forget Netflix has a reputation of sorts for, um, renewing shows
3812620	3817340	or not as the case may be to which a DJ on my S in chat is saying, bring back cowboy
3817340	3821220	bebop, which of course, you know, that was another high profile cancellation after the
3821220	3825580	first season that folks didn't, but I feel like more people liked that show than liked,
3825580	3826580	uh, resident evil.
3826580	3831940	I saw maybe one person that said something borderline positive about it.
3831940	3832940	I didn't see it.
3832940	3835740	So I've, I have no horse in the race.
3835740	3838940	I was looking at the dude playing, uh, I guess it's supposed to be Chris.
3838940	3841700	He looks kind of like bad cosplay.
3841700	3842700	He's cute though.
3842700	3843700	That's it.
3843700	3844700	All right.
3844700	3846740	Well, here's the thing though.
3846740	3849020	They don't just remove it from the service.
3849020	3850180	That's HBO max.
3850180	3854640	So if you could still go back and watch the first season, if you are feeling some sort
3854640	3855640	of way, enjoy.
3855640	3856640	All right.
3856640	3858620	I was looking to see what else they canceled.
3858620	3866820	They canceled another life, archive 81, cooking with Paris, which honestly, uh, yeah, no cooking
3866820	3867820	with Paris.
3867820	3868820	Q force.
3868900	3869900	Q force.
3869900	3871540	Why did I not know about that?
3871540	3872940	Well, oh, they canceled that.
3872940	3874460	I heard it was actually funny.
3874460	3875460	Yeah.
3875460	3876660	It was all right.
3876660	3880060	It also canceled raising Dion, the babysitter's club.
3880060	3882620	Oh, now see raising Dion, I'm kind of disappointed.
3882620	3884820	That actually was a decent series.
3884820	3891300	And the midnight gospel, um, fill a nine and chat says HBO max is kind of a mess right
3891300	3893300	now.
3893300	3897820	Girl, don't get us started.
3897820	3900260	Like H HBO max.
3900260	3901300	So bold.
3901300	3903380	They tried to cancel Sesame street.
3903380	3904380	Okay.
3904380	3910060	That's, that's the kind of pure, pure fuckery that's going on at HBO max right now.
3910060	3912220	Now, look, I understand it.
3912220	3914180	PBS owns Sesame street at the end of the day.
3914180	3915940	It's a complicated arrangement.
3915940	3924420	The whole, the whole fact that Sesame street would even be up for debate is sick in my
3924420	3925420	opinion.
3925420	3931700	But anyway, HBO max, she's a disaster.
3931700	3933900	She is a hot mess.
3933900	3934900	Anyway.
3934900	3935900	Yeah.
3935900	3939520	Bobby buckle says they did remove early versions of Sesame street.
3939520	3941820	They are just deleting stuff from the service.
3941820	3942820	That's the thing about Netflix.
3942820	3945420	They'll cancel everything, but they'll still try to say, Oh, you should go back and watch
3945420	3946420	resident evil.
3946420	3949520	Just, you know, to inflate the ratings and spend the hours on the service.
3949520	3950520	They don't just remember things.
3950520	3951520	For some reason.
3951520	3953520	Oh, for the record.
3953520	3957360	Um, I might've mentioned this before, but like there had been some episode of Sesame
3957360	3959080	street that had never been aired again.
3959080	3961880	Now it's on, uh, YouTube.
3961880	3962880	Which one is that?
3962880	3966320	Uh, I, we were watching it the other day.
3966320	3971900	I'll, I'll look it up and then I, the only one I've ever pulled up and watched on YouTube
3971900	3974040	was the one where Mr. Hooper passed away.
3974040	3978340	Um, which actually like in retrospect, you know, I remember seeing that as a kid, I think
3978340	3981120	a lot of folks around our age kind of remember that from being younger.
3981120	3983080	I think it was the one with Margaret Hamilton.
3983080	3987560	Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, interesting.
3987560	3989080	It was, yeah.
3989080	3998640	So it's the one, um, from 1976 and they found the episode and then someone put it up on,
3998640	4000800	uh, on YouTube.
4000800	4004640	Margaret Hamilton, the, uh, Wicked Witch of the West from the original, uh, yeah, she
4004640	4007840	was also on Mr. Rogers because that, that clip is around YouTube as well.
4007840	4012080	That one was great how she just puts on the outfit there to prove that she wasn't, you
4012080	4013080	know, scary.
4013080	4014080	Yeah.
4014080	4015080	Interesting.
4015080	4016080	All right.
4016080	4020920	Anyway, I was going to say, um, but the Mr. Hooper thing, like in retrospect is so well
4020920	4021920	done.
4021920	4025820	Like you don't like really, I think, appreciate it until you're older, like how they handled
4025820	4029600	such a sensitive subject with tact and dignity.
4029600	4033080	So, um, yeah, I, I, I remember it.
4033080	4034840	I still get verklempt watching it.
4034840	4037480	It's really, um, yeah, anyway.
4037480	4041760	Not to bring the show down, but you know, that, that is what HBO max is deleting.
4041760	4044040	Let's just put out, let's just, let's just put it out there.
4044040	4045040	All right.
4045040	4047880	And by the way, I linked the episode for people in chat.
4047880	4053820	It is Sesame street episode 847 from 1976.
4053820	4059080	And then after you watch that, go and listen to the, the 12 song with the pinball theme
4059080	4062800	because that, um, was an awesome, so watch any of that until tomorrow.
4062800	4063800	Okay.
4063800	4064800	Yeah.
4064800	4065800	Right now.
4065800	4066800	Right now you focus on us.
4066800	4067800	Okay.
4067800	4073720	Uh, moving on, uh, Loki, sorry, I've got like earthquake going on here.
4073720	4076840	This I need to tighten the screws on this desk and we're just going to just fall apart
4076840	4077840	one day.
4077840	4082480	Cause it shakes so easy every time there's no, well, that would be me.
4082480	4083480	All right.
4083480	4084480	Uh, moving on.
4084480	4085480	Loki, what do you have?
4085480	4086480	All right.
4086480	4092320	So here comes to nouveau putting its stupid head where it doesn't need to be.
4092320	4100840	Um, so Geneva was come out saying that, you know, Hey, Hey people, we need some more business.
4100840	4103920	So they're going to solve a problem that nobody has.
4103920	4109920	And that is with folks, um, emulating switch games on PC.
4109920	4113480	They're going to try to break it somehow.
4113480	4122140	I imagine that that will go as well as it's gone with their PC security, meaning it's
4122140	4128660	not going to make a difference and it's going to end up hurting the actual consumer more,
4128660	4130260	which tends to be the case.
4130260	4134940	So they are saying though, even if a game is protected against piracy on its PC version,
4134940	4138980	uh, it says the release version of the switch can be emulated from day one and played on
4138980	4139980	PC.
4139980	4145180	Therefore bypassing the strong protection, um, or strong protections offered on the PC
4145180	4150160	version, the Nintendo switch emulation protection will ensure that anyone wishing to play the
4150160	4152600	game has to buy a legitimate copy.
4152600	4153600	You're right.
4153600	4156580	Like, cause no one's ever bypassed you or security.
4156580	4163380	You're just impossible to beat like, and also like, even with like stuff like that, companies
4163380	4164880	have done that in the past.
4164880	4169920	Like you're not the first, they did this like even on like the 3DS and on like even older
4169920	4174960	games on other platforms where if you have a pirated version, it just doesn't work the
4174960	4175960	same way.
4175960	4176960	Like there's things that are broken with it.
4176960	4178360	Oh yeah, yeah.
4179120	4181240	This whole thing strikes me as a challenge.
4181240	4186920	Like Danuvo is just like, fight us and the entire internet's like, okay, they will lose.
4186920	4187920	I'm sorry.
4187920	4189760	Like they will end up losing Mike.
4189760	4191960	Mike Defton chat says Danuvo on switch.
4191960	4192960	Yeah.
4192960	4194760	Now more games will run even worse on switch.
4194760	4195760	Yeah.
4195760	4200280	I'm suddenly reminded of like how well optimized and I say that tongue firmly planted in cheek,
4200280	4205200	how well optimized cooking mama on the switch was where people were playing that game going,
4205200	4208600	is this bitch mining Bitcoin on my switch?
4208600	4211440	Why is this game running like such garbage?
4211440	4213320	And that's what we have to look forward to.
4213320	4217800	Yeah, I haven't weren't they in a switch game already or something like wasn't there some
4217800	4218800	sort of DRA?
4218800	4219800	I don't know.
4219800	4226560	But anyways, they're saying that they're going to, you know, try to it just seems like marketing
4226560	4228400	speak but like it's never worked.
4228400	4234200	I think from what I remember, like, what would it Okay, let's just hypothetically let's just
4234200	4243560	pretend for a second there that the concern was people, you know, emulating these games.
4243560	4248880	Most of the time emulation happens after a game comes out like a while after the game
4248880	4249880	comes out.
4249880	4250880	Right.
4250880	4256840	So like, if I can't emulate a day one, I don't think that's necessarily going to cause more
4256840	4258680	sales to happen.
4258680	4263300	It's just like if people are hell bent on emulating the game, they're not going to buy
4263300	4265660	the game and all you're doing is hurting the consumer.
4265660	4269740	A lot of pirates just keep an active stockpile of games they never intended to purchase in
4269740	4271700	the first place, which I'm not saying makes it right.
4271700	4274140	And I don't want to make it sound like I'm advocating for piracy.
4274140	4280000	Like I understand that it can be very frustrating to see that people are playing switch releases
4280000	4282620	on day one that they didn't pay for.
4282620	4283620	Like I get that.
4283620	4288060	Yeah, the thing the thing and I understand that the video game industry has a vested
4288060	4289260	interest in protecting that.
4289260	4293740	So again, I'm not defending the act of pirating modern day games.
4293740	4298500	Now when it comes to emulating the Super Nintendo and the NES, I say we're in a completely different
4298500	4304420	realm that has to do a game preservation licensing and all that bullshit fuckery that happens.
4304420	4310100	That means we don't have classic fucking games like the Guardian Legend available to play
4310100	4311580	on modern consoles.
4311580	4315140	We have to emulate that and we need to be able to do that.
4315140	4318140	However, here's here's the thing, sorry, Loki, before I let's finish.
4318140	4322460	Here's the thing with this is that I think where we take issue with this is that Denuvo
4322460	4326620	is coming in going, don't worry, I'll fix it.
4326620	4328500	And it's like, shut up.
4328500	4335500	Nobody asked you like, here's, did you consider maybe just doing your thing quietly and not
4335500	4337460	having to advertise?
4337460	4342780	Because what you're doing with this is you are literally inviting the entire dark side
4342780	4346860	of the internet and the people you don't want to be doing this in the first, you are just
4346860	4348980	inviting them to fight.
4348980	4353900	You have, Denuvo has literally sent an email to all of the hackers and crackers in the
4353900	4359020	entire galaxy going bike racks, 3pm, see you there.
4359020	4364740	And now they're going to create a problem that I would argue didn't, it's that whole
4364740	4369420	blowing something out of proportion because yes, is piracy happening on the Switch?
4369420	4370420	Yes.
4370420	4373340	Is piracy only going to get worse because of this announcement?
4373340	4374340	Yes.
4374820	4380080	Does Nintendo think it's a problem that's, you know, warrants another company solving
4380080	4381080	it for them?
4381080	4386740	No, because Nintendo is not even involved in this initiative that Denuvo is taking themselves
4386740	4389340	upon to try to solve.
4389340	4392780	So like, who is going to utilize this?
4392780	4398220	A third party company is like, a third party publisher is going to do that, like, then
4398220	4403280	once people catch wind that that game has Denuvo, you know what that does on PC games?
4403280	4405160	Most people try to avoid that shit.
4405160	4410960	So like, it's like, Denuvo is up on their soapbox making a proclamation and Nintendo
4410960	4417360	is down in front going, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.
4417360	4421320	It's just, it's dumb.
4421320	4422320	So dumb.
4422320	4425840	SSJ 100 Matt brings up an excellent point.
4425840	4430080	Piracy has become a necessary evil in the fight for game preservation.
4430080	4434880	There are so many games disappearing forever on the 3DS store soon.
4434880	4435880	Fact!
4435880	4441680	That is well stated by SSJ 100 Matt and an excellent example of, somebody's going to
4441680	4444040	wildly take me out of context.
4444040	4446340	Don't do it, but I'm going to say it.
4446340	4447880	Why we need piracy.
4447880	4456880	Yeah, and on top of this too, like, okay, so yeah, this does also like, you know, allegedly
4456880	4462720	could probably won't because their cop protection sucks, but could prohibit, you know, the backing
4462720	4468920	up of these games later on for archival purpose, um, Denuvo claims that these checks that they
4468920	4473480	would implement would be offline checks being meaning that the keys are going to be hidden
4473480	4476580	within the games.
4476580	4483080	How this is never going to not be like cracked immediately is beyond me how they think that
4483080	4484800	this is going to ever work.
4485240	4493200	It's not ever going to work, but I mean, sure, sure Denuvo.
4493200	4497300	Phila9 with a really good question, I'm not actually sure the answer to in our chat asking
4497300	4500200	are these games captured at the Library of Congress?
4500200	4502680	I know they archive a lot of games.
4502680	4506160	I think it would be impossible to archive everything.
4506160	4508640	There's so many Indian self published things out there.
4508640	4513400	I'm not sure they all get captured in an official governmental capacity.
4513400	4518600	However, we have certainly heard of efforts, like for example, what we just had recently
4518600	4524360	Embracer group, right, has that big, you know, museum physical place that they're building
4524360	4530760	to try to preserve games like video game preservation is becoming more and more of a thing you see
4530760	4534720	out there like, you know, just enthusiasts.
4534720	4537520	And you kind of joke about your librarian brain.
4537520	4542000	But I would argue others with librarian brains out there who also love video games are kind
4542000	4546360	of trying to solve because I'm not sure there's like a government thing in there.
4546360	4548840	Oh, and Bobby Blackwell puts an excellent point there.
4548840	4551560	The games industry fights against libraries archiving their stuff.
4551560	4552560	That's right.
4552560	4555440	I remember this thing about this here, because if there is remotely a chance that someone
4555440	4558920	could play the game for fun because of the library archive, that's a problem.
4558920	4564320	I remember that was a story a couple years ago, towards the beginning of the pandemic.
4564320	4565320	You're right.
4565320	4569360	Somebody was trying to fight against that whole preservation thing because heaven forbid,
4569360	4573640	somebody is, you know, pirating a game that's no longer for sale.
4573640	4575080	It's just interesting.
4575080	4581120	So but I think I think, again, once something is on the Internet, you're not going to get
4581120	4582180	it off the Internet.
4582180	4588400	And so you see other ways of archiving things that are out there, such as archive.org, right?
4588400	4591380	The Internet archive is a big thing.
4591380	4593020	But of course, they're getting sued over it.
4593020	4596440	So yeah.
4596440	4601800	But as Joe and Matt says, listen, I would pay for a service to play all of these old
4601800	4602800	games.
4602800	4603800	Anyone would.
4603800	4604800	Well, I shouldn't say anyone would.
4604800	4607360	And I don't want to make it sound like I'm belittling your comment because I'm not.
4607360	4612980	But I think what it really comes down to is these legal issues that hold games back from
4612980	4614240	being able to.
4614240	4620980	This is the part that bites the game industry in the fucking ass when it comes to this stuff.
4620980	4625120	Like again, I'm going to use Guardian Legend as my example, because you know the love I
4625120	4626260	have for that game.
4626260	4630200	The Dark Sakura has to that game that Loki, I'm going to just say, has love for that game,
4630200	4631420	whether he does or not.
4631420	4634480	We have a big love for the Guardian Legend here at Orange Mountains Radio.
4634480	4638160	And you again cannot play that game through legal purposes right now because it is caught
4638160	4640520	up in licensing fuckery right now.
4640520	4643880	And that is doing the games industry a disservice.
4643880	4648120	If they were to put out the Guardian Legend for 10 bucks on the Nintendo Switch, I would
4648120	4649120	buy it tomorrow.
4649120	4651280	I bet Dark Sakura would be tempted to pick it up as well.
4651280	4653260	I think there'd be a lot of people who would pick it up.
4653260	4654260	But it doesn't happen.
4654260	4655260	Why?
4655260	4656260	Because of these issues.
4656260	4664440	And the business side of video games ruins video games way too often in this industry.
4664440	4666440	And it sucks.
4666440	4674140	Anyway, Savalusan Chat, hi, says, we need a video game vault just like the seed vault
4674140	4675140	in Norway.
4675140	4679640	Well, ironically, that whole Embracer group thing I'm talking about is what they're trying
4679640	4681120	to basically build.
4681120	4684360	So there is that.
4684360	4688500	Bobby Black Wolf with an interesting perspective too saying Super Mario Brothers will enter
4688500	4691640	the public domain in 2060.
4691640	4696940	It'll be very interesting to see what happens in the future as you know, because I didn't
4696940	4704360	they refuse to extend the Disney law any further like Mickey Mouse, circa Steamboat Willie
4704360	4707820	is going into the public domain if he hasn't already, right?
4707820	4712460	Like Disney ran out of time finally, and they couldn't convince Congress to buy more.
4712460	4714220	So it's going to be interesting.
4714220	4719320	So anyway, all right, let's move on.
4719320	4726960	Let's talk about Steam, the mobile app version, which it hasn't been updated in a long time,
4726960	4729760	but it's going to be getting updated, which is great because I kind of think the mobile
4729760	4732160	app they have now is a little bit clunky and aged.
4732160	4736960	So they're going to be updating the app, of course, Android and iOS we're talking about.
4736960	4743760	And they're going to be, I guess they've already invited invested users to beta test this app.
4744760	4751060	Using a redesigned client, they've built it on a new framework, they've modernized design.
4751060	4756300	So you can do more intelligent notifications, multi account support, that's nice.
4756300	4759140	And this is great, a new way to get into your account.
4759140	4762820	So you don't have to worry about the username, the password, the Steam guard, you just use
4762820	4766740	a QR code like you do on Discord or Signal or something like that.
4766740	4770020	That is going to be the most time saving new feature that they're putting into that, which
4770020	4771300	is cool.
4771300	4774280	Apparently the beta is still running a little bit sluggish right now, but they're hoping
4774280	4777800	to get that working before it comes out.
4777800	4783920	So iOS does have a beta, that beta is limited to 10,000 users right now because of the restrictions
4783920	4785640	of test flight.
4785640	4790200	But you can check that out on the Steam website if you're curious to get into it, steamcommunity.com
4790200	4792520	slash groups slash Steam mobile app.
4792520	4796280	I'll wait for the full release, but I think this is an exciting thing that's coming.
4796280	4800720	The Steam mobile app badly needed something like this, especially when it comes to Steam
4800740	4801740	Guard.
4801740	4804460	So I think that's cool.
4804460	4807620	Going to chat, they're talking about public domain things.
4807620	4812700	Bobby Black Wolf and DJ Rama S are pointing out Winnie the Pooh is in public domain now,
4812700	4814260	hence the horror movie.
4814260	4820020	Yes, I actually, I know the people there through a weird like three degrees of separation type
4820020	4821580	of thing.
4821580	4826100	And so that's, yeah, that's a great point is that's the type of stuff.
4826100	4832660	But if I remember right, it's only Winnie the Pooh and not Christopher Robin the way
4832660	4834920	he's portrayed in the Disney movies.
4834920	4838240	Like it's very interesting what they can and can't do.
4838240	4842200	So we'll see more and more and more stuff like that to come in the future.
4842200	4845680	I wonder if that's why we see all this Pinocchio stuff now too.
4845680	4849800	But that was, that was based on a book that wasn't like an original Disney thing, right?
4849800	4854480	So that book has to be public domain at this point.
4854860	4855860	All right.
4855860	4857900	Anyway, let's move on.
4857900	4863340	Um, an update on an incredibly frustrating story, Dark Sakura.
4866340	4871620	So and I've actually been following her now for a little bit.
4871620	4882900	So we were following the story of Kethals, Clara Sorrenti, who had been doxxed and, and
4882920	4887640	I've got a little bit more on this than just what the article says too, has had to leave
4887640	4898960	Canada because of harassment and is living in an undisclosed location in Europe.
4898960	4902220	And there's a lot, there's a lot more.
4902220	4907960	So I'll go ahead and read what, what she said, as a Twitch broadcaster, my livelihood relies
4907960	4912880	on the connections I form with my audience and is harder than it would be in any other
4912880	4917500	profession to keep my location hidden, hidden, I want to keep working and because I know
4917500	4921360	I have this huge target on my back, I've decided to take refuge in Europe where I have close
4921360	4925960	friends who are willing to host me, so I can continue to stream while my stalkers continuously
4925960	4931320	try to hunt me down and send the message I am never safe.
4931320	4935520	And she also had posted about her Uber account being hacked and like a bunch of food showing
4935520	4938560	up that was charged on her account.
4938560	4943680	You would think Uber would have a safeguard on that after you order so many different
4943680	4944880	restaurants.
4944880	4948660	Like I can, I can understand why somebody might order from two or three different restaurants,
4948660	4952620	you know, depending on what picky eaters or party, but the amount of food she got, like,
4952620	4954160	why didn't Uber have a fail safe on that?
4954160	4955160	That's really weird to me.
4955160	4956160	I don't know.
4956160	4957160	That's beside the point.
4957160	4963260	Well, well, well, I, I would say that, yeah, companies, all companies need to realize there
4963260	4965520	are shitty people out there doing shitty things.
4965520	4971320	But anyway, I know it's, it's past the main point, but Uber does need to look into it.
4971320	4979900	Anyway, um, the whole thing has been going because she's had a very big, uh, campaign
4979900	4985000	now to get this, uh, harassment site Kiwi Farms taken down.
4985000	4988360	Uh, and the site's been taken down a few times.
4988360	4994320	Um, but, but she's been working really hard and knowing what this site is.
4994320	5001120	Um, there have been many, many, many, uh, outreach has gone to Cloudflare who has been
5001120	5009280	hosting them and not paying attention to any of, of the demands that have been, you know,
5009280	5010280	going on.
5010280	5018600	And these are people who have got done full, uh, uh, harassment, uh, I would almost say
5018600	5030000	campaigns against other people, um, and have, you know, been a hotbed for racism, antisemitism,
5030000	5032080	transphobia, homophobia, you name it.
5032080	5039440	If it's not, you know, this gender white male, they've got a problem with it.
5039440	5046560	Um, and also, uh, for supporting, uh, Putin just also adding that in there too.
5046560	5055480	So, um, but thankfully she, uh, hasn't slacked off at all in her advocacy.
5055480	5057800	There are people making fake accounts.
5057800	5060960	I found one that was deleted just today.
5060960	5067640	Um, there are, it's, it's just people still spreading misinformation about her.
5067640	5071360	People just, it's disgusting.
5071360	5072440	It's really disgusting.
5072440	5077280	And she is keeping her head high and working hard on it.
5077280	5084360	And honestly, I, I, she's doing really amazing work under a really stressful situation.
5084360	5089280	And I think that we need to make sure that we get the word spread to support her and
5089280	5091240	support what she's doing.
5091240	5097280	And also make sure that we, you know, go out saying that this type of behavior is not going
5097280	5103360	to be permitted in our society, will not be tolerated, and that we will stand up against
5103360	5104360	it.
5104360	5105360	Yeah.
5105360	5108040	Um, definitely good for her for hanging in there.
5108040	5113720	Um, I, I don't know how she's doing it cause she's just constantly taking abuse.
5113720	5114720	It's sick.
5114720	5122720	They went, they went on her father's, uh, Memorial Facebook and we're taking photos
5122720	5126880	that were on that account and captioning them saying that he would be disappointed with
5126880	5131240	her and that he would hate her and all of this when she was like, no, he was completely
5131240	5133640	supportive of me all up until the end.
5133640	5135780	So how can some people sleep at night?
5135780	5137360	How can some people sleep at night?
5137360	5138360	So gross.
5138360	5141820	There are evil people in the world and they don't care what they do because they have
5141820	5148880	anonymity behind them except for, uh, the, the guy who's, I think running the Kiwi farm
5148880	5149880	site.
5149880	5160640	Um, apparently a trans person that, uh, that he had doxed showed up at his house and, uh,
5160640	5166320	he went and hid in his bedroom and his mother dealt with, dealt with her.
5166320	5168120	Like the scared little bitch that they were.
5168120	5175200	Oh, and his mother's just as bad as he is apparently, but it's just completely unforgivable
5175200	5177520	and they're not human.
5177520	5183160	I'm not a super religious person, but I do firmly believe that for those people, God
5183160	5186160	or whatever you want to call it, God is going to kick your ass.
5186160	5188200	That is, I firmly believe it.
5188200	5190360	So for the record, that isn't karma.
5190360	5191360	That's not what karma is.
5191360	5192920	I didn't call it karma.
5192920	5193920	Yeah.
5193920	5196600	I'm just, I'm telling that for other people.
5196600	5200280	People like to say that that's karma when that is not what karma is.
5200280	5203320	Um, it's appropriate to have to use that term.
5203320	5213160	Um, but I do believe that the, you know, it's a physics law, you know, uh, for every action
5213160	5217680	there is an opposite and equal reaction, right?
5217680	5220660	The reaction is going to come.
5220660	5222960	It's already coming.
5222960	5229600	And these people are going, look, already that guy in his site is losing, um, public
5229600	5230600	opinion.
5230600	5234960	He put out a statement saying, I've been losing public opinion and men men men men
5234960	5235960	men.
5235960	5236960	And we're like, okay, cry me a big river.
5236960	5238960	You big baby.
5238960	5240800	Go hide in mommy's closet.
5240800	5241800	Yeah.
5241800	5245480	Like if you want to dish it out, you need to be able to take it too.
5245480	5246480	Yeah.
5246480	5247960	All right.
5247960	5252540	Let's move on, uh, onto, I would say onto a happier note, although I'm not sure lawsuits
5252540	5255800	are usually happy stories, but, um, it's the best transition I've got.
5255800	5258160	So Loki, what's next?
5258160	5259160	All right.
5259720	5263200	So, um, let's talk about more lawsuits.
5263200	5271120	So Sony is being sued for $5.9 billion, uh, allegedly for ripping people off on digital
5271120	5272120	games.
5272120	5276840	And the reason that they're trying to make, or the, the reason that they're suing or the
5276840	5282320	argument that they're trying to make is that because Sony charges a 30% commission fee
5282320	5286540	and all digital purchases made through the UK PlayStation store.
5286540	5293320	This is a UK lawsuit, um, that it causes, I guess the games to be higher priced also
5293320	5299960	because they control their own digital marketplace.
5299960	5308080	Like I mean, all the other companies do, um, that they are anti-competitive.
5308080	5312760	And so because of that, since there's no competition, um, it leaves the prices being
5312760	5313760	high.
5313760	5317000	I think it's gonna be a hard argument for them to make.
5317000	5318560	It's gonna be very hard.
5318560	5323640	It's like, that's like that Epic games, Apple argument that didn't work out well.
5323640	5330620	So Sony is not doing anything different from what many peers in several industries are
5330620	5331720	also doing.
5331720	5336520	So I just don't see how this, why PlayStation is getting called out when they're literally
5336520	5339280	doing the exact same thing, Nintendo and Microsoft specifically.
5339280	5343080	And then if you kind of go further out into other entertainment industries, you know,
5343080	5347280	Apple, Google, and you know, the folks on the phones, this is like this 30% is pretty
5347280	5348280	much a standard.
5348280	5349280	Yeah.
5349280	5355520	And I guess you could say with Microsoft, it might be harder to make that argument because
5355520	5359240	they have their games on other platforms.
5359240	5361860	Like they have Microsoft games on steam.
5361860	5365860	You can get Microsoft games on the Microsoft game store.
5365860	5370780	Um, so that might be harder to make the argument or they just pick Sony to start, you know,
5370780	5371780	trying to Sue.
5371780	5373560	I don't think they're going to win.
5373560	5376500	I don't think this, anything's going to come of this, but I don't either.
5376500	5378980	I think it gets laughed out of court.
5378980	5379980	Yeah.
5379980	5386660	It's, I mean, they're probably just like, well, if we win even 1%, that's a lot of money.
5386660	5388340	I don't think that's going to happen.
5388340	5389940	I don't either, but we'll see.
5389940	5390940	We'll keep an eye on it.
5391020	5392020	All right.
5392020	5393020	Another thing to keep an eye on.
5393020	5394020	This is a game.
5394020	5395020	We don't talk about enough.
5395020	5396460	This game is so cool.
5396460	5401140	I really enjoy just some chill with Microsoft flight simulator.
5401140	5405220	And we got some news that a games com that a big upgrade for Microsoft flight simulator
5405220	5408180	is incoming on November the 11th.
5408180	5409920	Originally this was supposed to come on the 22nd.
5409920	5414540	And this is the rare story of an expansion getting bumped up as opposed to bump back,
5414540	5416300	but it's apparently ready to go.
5416300	5418460	And this is the 40th anniversary edition.
5418500	5422980	Obviously we're celebrating the flight simulator series as a whole.
5422980	5429260	And this new expansion will basically be free for those that have Xbox game pass because
5429260	5431460	the original games on it.
5431460	5436140	What will be added in this helicopters and gliders you'll be able to, which is the first
5436140	5438900	time they've been seen in the series for a while.
5438900	5444020	Also going to be added to the series an actual like commercial airliner.
5444540	5449640	They have some in the game, but the very popular Airbus A310 is going to be added to the game.
5449640	5453380	So if you want to fly your own, I guess, Southwest flight, you can do that.
5453380	5454800	So that's kind of neat.
5454800	5458440	There's also some more historical aircraft that are getting added to the game.
5458440	5465240	The Spruce Goose, the Spirit of St. Louis, the original flight from May of 1927.
5465240	5466500	Those are going in the game.
5466500	5473180	They're also going to be adding some more airports, glider airports, heliports, and
5473180	5474180	so on.
5474180	5480580	There's also a new city update that just came out that includes photo improvements
5480580	5486920	for some locations in Germany, which of course is the home of Gamescom.
5486920	5493160	So that's why Germany got some cities like Canover, Cologne, and so forth got their cities
5493160	5495060	reworked a little bit for Gamescom.
5495060	5496380	So pretty cool.
5496380	5500900	Anyway, I definitely recommend flight simulator, especially if you're a game pass person, then
5500900	5502820	there's really nothing to pay for it.
5503180	5508620	It's a really good use case for cloud as well, because the download is gigantic, but it plays
5508620	5509620	fine on the cloud.
5509620	5510620	It's super cute.
5510620	5514700	So that's one I definitely recommend checking out.
5514700	5516820	All right.
5516820	5522800	So flight simulator turns 40, and that's certainly a classic game.
5522800	5526820	But every week here on the program, we like to highlight another classic game in this
5526820	5528500	segment coming up right now.
5532820	5544420	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5544420	5545780	out a classic and-
5545780	5546780	What's the difference between-
5546780	5551980	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5551980	5552980	Sorry about that.
5552980	5558500	A dumb ad came up while I was trying to get the B roll up here, but Dark Soccer-
5558500	5559500	You pay for it.
5559500	5560500	Yeah.
5560500	5561500	Dark Soccer, why don't you tell us-
5561500	5562500	I pay for it.
5563180	5564540	I pay for mine.
5564540	5567220	Let's get to the classic game of the week.
5567220	5569880	What game did you pick for us this week?
5569880	5576140	I picked Final Fantasy Tactics, which I haven't done it before, and I pretty much know why.
5576140	5578500	I'm not a fan of tactics games.
5578500	5587180	As much as I love Final Fantasy, and as much as this series is well beloved by many people,
5587180	5589380	I don't like tactics games.
5589380	5596260	But I'm still going to cover it because I know a lot of people do like tactics games.
5596260	5601660	I would also like to just point out that if someone says they don't like something, don't
5601660	5602660	immediately go,
5602660	5603660	Yeah, well, I do.
5603660	5604660	Like it's a personal challenge.
5604660	5606660	Just saying.
5606660	5615420	Anyway, it came out for PlayStation, published by Square, released in Japan on June 1994
5615420	5622460	and in the U.S. January 1998 by Sony Computer Entertainment, the very first of the Tactics
5622460	5625980	series in the Final Fantasy franchise.
5625980	5632300	And it's the first game that's set in the fictional world, later known as...
5632300	5634820	Is it Ivalice, I think?
5634820	5645140	So it follows Ramza Bolv, I guess I can't pronounce that, who is a cadet who is in a
5645140	5651700	military conflict called the Lion War and about the stuff going on with it.
5651700	5661980	Anyway, production began in 1995 by Matsuno Yasumi, who had created Ogre Battle with Quest.
5661980	5675940	But there was a desire to do a tactic game that involved class-based conflict and writing
5675940	5677540	history.
5677540	5681380	And so they were that director and writer.
5681380	5687740	And then Sakaguchi Hironobu, who was the Final Fantasy creator, was a producer and they just
5687740	5699900	got more and more awesome people in as they kept doing, including Iwata as a composer.
5699900	5706740	So at any rate, the game is...
5706740	5709220	Actually this is a different Iwata, I don't know why I said that.
5709220	5716660	This is Masaharu, but moving forward.
5716660	5725660	The game itself, it really pushed some boundaries when it came out.
5725660	5730580	So we're basically going to go into a little bit of that gameplay.
5730580	5732120	It's a tactics game.
5732120	5736700	So you follow your protagonist through the game and you have two modes, you have battles
5736700	5738700	and world map.
5738700	5745620	Battles will be on isometric fields and you move them by tiles and they have different
5745620	5755780	attacks and it is turn-based, although they have a charge time that is going into play
5755780	5757440	inside those battles.
5757440	5760700	You have your hit points for your enemies, your hit points yourself, you get experience
5760700	5761700	points as you go along.
5761700	5768880	And in the world map, you move on these paths connecting towns and battle points.
5768880	5772140	And of course, when your character icon is on the town, you can open a menu there where
5772140	5777060	you can go to the bar to look for side quests or shop for supplies or soldier office for
5777060	5778900	recruiting.
5778900	5783780	You also can go to fur shops that you get for poaching.
5783780	5785700	Don't approve of that, but whatever.
5785700	5788660	You do get some random battles.
5788660	5797460	And then if you go over these certain green spots, then you will get another random encounter.
5797460	5801060	It does have a character class system that lets you customize your characters into different
5801060	5802060	roles.
5802060	5808100	So you have most of the original character classes from Final Fantasy games, like summoners,
5808100	5814660	black mages, white mages, monks, dragoons, and thieves.
5814660	5818060	Black mages were called wizards, white mages were called priests, and dragons were called
5818060	5820220	lancers.
5820220	5826060	You have new, you start out as either a squire or a chemist, which is the base for either
5826060	5832780	a warrior or magician job, and it has like 20 something jobs.
5832780	5837580	You get job points that you can apply to your different jobs as well.
5837580	5841180	And then when you've learned all the abilities in that job class, you're considered mastered
5841180	5844900	and you can learn something else.
5844900	5854340	So at any rate, it was actually conceived in 93 by Sakaguchi, who loves tactics games.
5854340	5860260	And he was unable to work on it at the time due to the main series.
5860260	5870300	But eventually things came together and they were, he teamed up with Matsuno, of course,
5870300	5874820	like I said, who worked on the Ogre Battle series, and when Tactics Ogre Let Us Cling
5874820	5881860	Together was done, then they went over and started working on the game.
5881860	5892060	It was, the music in and of itself was also written by two people who worked on Ogre Battle,
5892060	5898620	so Iwata Masaharu and Sakimoto Hitoshi.
5898620	5906340	They worked on that and they actually did release CDs by DigiCube on June 21st, 1997,
5906340	5910620	and re-released by Squenix on March 24th, 2006.
5910620	5913740	So there were other versions.
5913740	5918380	Tactics first came out, like I said, June 20th, 1997, and it came bundled with a demo
5918380	5920820	disc for Saga Frontier.
5920820	5928460	And then the English localization was outsourced, although part of the localization had been
5928460	5935920	done by Square USA's Michael Baskett and did a script kind of like Old English, but it
5935920	5939900	made it really hard to understand the games that was toned down.
5939900	5949020	It came out in North America January 28th, 1998, and it also was re-released to Square's
5949020	5951500	Millennium Collection.
5951500	5957260	This series was released in Japan and each title had its own set of different merchandise.
5957260	5964020	Final Fantasy Tactics was sold June 29th, 2000, along with Saga Frontier, Saga Frontier
5964020	5972780	2, Brave Fencer Musashi, Front Mission 3, Ergeiz, and Legend of Mana.
5972780	5979100	It was selected to be part of the Greatest Hits re-releases four years after its initial
5979100	5984380	release, and then it also then became a part of the Ultimate Hits, which was their budget
5984380	5985380	range in Japan.
5985380	5991500	There was a PSP PlayStation Portable version called Final Fantasy Tactics The War of the
5991500	5997580	Lions came out May 10th, 2007 in Japan and then other places after.
5997580	6002780	Second game is part of the Ivalice Alliance.
6002780	6007420	It also had an updated version of the original Final Fantasy Tactics with in-game cutscenes,
6007420	6010700	new characters, and multiplayer.
6010700	6016220	It also updated to a 16.9 widescreen support, new items, new jobs, cel-shaded full motion
6016220	6017220	videos.
6017220	6023020	And the English version has voice acting where the Japanese version does not.
6023020	6030940	The game sold almost 825,000 copies in Japan in the first half of 1997 and ended with 1.24
6030940	6033700	million copies sold.
6033700	6040540	By the end of 2007, it had sold approximately 1.3 million copies in Japan and then, as of
6040540	6046420	August 2011, 2.4 million copies worldwide.
6046420	6048940	It was greatly lauded.
6048940	6054140	People thought that it was challenging and required, you know, definitely more strategy
6054140	6057180	and a little bit more involvement.
6057180	6062900	The spell effects, 3D backgrounds, the camera being rotatable, zooming, all of that.
6062900	6067660	Other reviewers didn't really like it, but they don't count.
6067660	6073340	There's some people who said it should have been 2D, man, like no.
6073900	6087100	It just really, the story especially was praised, although having so many characters look similar
6087100	6090860	made it hard to distinguish who was who.
6090860	6099260	And of course, the English localization was overrun with grammatical mistakes, so I'm
6099260	6100380	just saying.
6100380	6105420	Like I was telling the people who did Hooked on You, get a proofreader.
6105420	6108620	But soundtrack, of course, was greatly praised.
6108620	6112980	IGN gave the Editor's Choice Award in 1998.
6112980	6117460	GameSpot listed as one of the greatest games of all time in 2007.
6117460	6121180	It just, it won more and more and more.
6121180	6127420	So the world for Final Fantasy Tactics has been featured in other games.
6127420	6134420	The development staff that did Vagrant Story also had references to Final Fantasy Tactics,
6134420	6139060	and they are both set in the same world.
6139060	6147300	And Final Fantasy XII, when it was released, is also in the same world, the world of Ivalice.
6147300	6157020	Final Fantasy XIII Revenant Wings was also supposed to have been sent in the same world.
6157020	6163060	Final Fantasy Tactics Advance came out in 2003 and had a smaller cast of characters
6163060	6164500	and a little bit simpler of a plot.
6164500	6171820	It's an indirect sequel, came out called Final Fantasy Tactics A2, Grimoire of the Rift.
6171820	6179140	Ramza and Agrias were in the online card game Lord of the Million 3 in 2014.
6179140	6183940	Ramza is playable in Dissidia Final Fantasy NT.
6183940	6191780	In Final Fantasy XIV, A Realm Reborn had an alternate version of Ramza and his companions
6191780	6195100	that died at the end of Tactics.
6195100	6199020	So they're in Final Fantasy XIV.
6199020	6203220	Final Fantasy Tactics is featured in the Final Fantasy Trading Card Game with Ramza, Delita,
6203220	6209100	Agrias, and other characters appearing in Opus 1.
6209100	6212660	Tactics has appeared in other of the Opuses.
6212660	6217620	And there's a remix song of Avelia and Delita that was nominated for Best Game Music Cover
6217620	6225860	Remix at the 16th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards.
6225860	6227740	And that's it.
6227740	6230060	Final Fantasy Tactics is ooze.
6230060	6231460	All right.
6231460	6232460	Great pick.
6232460	6237300	I know it's not a game that you're personally into, but I kind of felt like what you were
6237300	6242620	saying in the beginning about the whole, like, you know, this tactics isn't usually a genre.
6242620	6245660	And even for me, I don't usually get into tactics.
6245660	6246660	Tactical games is a genre.
6246660	6251100	I don't get entertained by them very often, but I have a deep love of Final Fantasy.
6251100	6253020	So it was one of those things where I was like, I had to try this one.
6253020	6254820	And I, I do, I do like it.
6254820	6261860	I don't think I'm as into it as like some other people are, but I do find it very interesting
6261860	6265140	that Square- You're not dating, but you're very good friends.
6265140	6266140	Yeah.
6266140	6267140	Yeah.
6267140	6269700	You know, I have the phone number in my phone that I might want to call once in a while
6269700	6270700	when I'm feeling lonely.
6270780	6277420	You know, it's just one of those things where it's like, I'm surprised that Square hasn't
6277420	6281060	tried to do more of these games with how well received it.
6281060	6282060	You know, yes.
6282060	6283060	I know there was advances.
6283060	6284060	I mean, I'm just surprised-
6284060	6285060	Favorite story.
6285060	6286060	They've done a few others.
6286060	6291700	But I mean, specifically Final Fantasy, you know, but yeah, but I like what they did with
6291700	6292700	the job system.
6292700	6296780	I liked, you know, that in the game and definitely you see this game's influence on other Final
6296780	6297780	Fantasy games.
6297780	6302500	Force 14, you know, some of the other things you named there in that.
6302500	6303500	But yeah.
6303500	6307060	So yeah, great pick, Final Fantasy Tactics.
6307060	6309540	A real classic, if there ever was one.
6309540	6310940	All right.
6310940	6315900	Let's move on and talk about some other quick headlines around the gaming industry and some
6315900	6317900	rapid fire news.
6317900	6318900	We'll start with Loki.
6318900	6321460	Everybody's got a podcast now.
6321460	6325380	So- Well, we were first.
6325380	6326540	We were one of the first guests.
6326540	6327540	One of the first.
6328540	6338420	So Sakurai has got his own podcast now on YouTube, or I should say it's like a YouTube
6338420	6342700	series and talking about game development.
6342700	6344820	So that's pretty cool.
6344820	6345820	And then-
6345820	6348720	He is allowed to do whatever he wants, including a podcast.
6348720	6353340	He's delivered on every wish that people have for the Smash Brothers series over the years.
6353340	6357660	He's worked day and night and all the time in between on those games.
6357660	6358660	You know what?
6358660	6364380	If he wants to do a podcast, may it be the best podcast there ever was.
6364380	6368140	Except for this one, of course.
6368140	6373620	Also Hideo Kojima announced that he's got a podcast exclusively for Spotify.
6373620	6374620	How dare he?
6374620	6376620	It's called Brain Structure.
6376620	6380740	You can check that out there.
6381140	6385780	And then, of course, we have an acquisition in the indie scape.
6385780	6392020	So we've got Tiny Build has acquired a Bossa Studios, who are best known for their weird
6392020	6396780	simulation games or weird like physics comedy games.
6396780	6401900	So they have, of course, I Am Bread, Surgeon Simulator, I Am Fish.
6401900	6407540	So those have been- that's been purchased by Tiny Build for $3 million.
6407540	6408540	Great.
6408540	6409540	Great.
6409540	6410540	All right.
6410540	6411540	Yeah.
6411540	6417580	Darsakra, with, I think, some more insight on something that came up last week or the
6417580	6418580	week before.
6418580	6419580	Yeah.
6419580	6426260	Except show role actually accidentally got closed, my apologies.
6426260	6431100	So yeah, so I'm a fan of Guilty Gear.
6431100	6432100	I like this series.
6432100	6436300	I've cosplayed Baikon from it, much to my husband's chagrin because of how much cleavage
6436300	6438620	it showed.
6438620	6443460	But there's a character who has been problematic, and that's Bridget.
6443460	6453340	Bridget originally was a boy raised as a girl, not necessarily choosing that as an identity,
6453340	6455000	I reckon.
6455000	6464900	But now they finally have just completely come out and said, no, she's trans.
6464900	6472220	She is, in fact, this is as of Guilty Gear Strive, that they confirmed that Bridget
6472220	6479340	is transgender and that, but she had been using, people had used masculine pronouns
6479340	6487380	toward her, but now she is officially being referred to as her correct gender.
6487380	6489340	She's wearing, of course, the feminine clothes.
6489340	6495480	She still always presented herself as a woman.
6495480	6503160	And so now she is still, she is now completely being referred to as a woman.
6503160	6509260	And it's about time, you know, she had been misgendered for an age.
6509260	6514640	She was sort of like in this middle ground where they, you know, people were referring
6514640	6519760	to as, and I hate using the term, but people were refusing to her as a trap.
6519760	6523320	And that's completely unfair to the trans community.
6523320	6527480	It's completely disgust, you know, disgusting that people would do that.
6527480	6543800	And so now like we've had in this one, so they've had a scene now in the arcade mode
6543800	6550340	where Bridget is talking with Dickinson and Kaikisuke about her self-discovering and how
6550340	6555240	she's learned herself and that the final destination will be worthwhile.
6555240	6563120	And they agreed with her and they, you know, provided some advice, like legit advice, leave
6563120	6568320	behind the fear of prejudice, become who you were meant to be.
6568320	6573000	It's all worth the heartache to be your true self.
6573000	6582860	And then she responds to a statement about being a cowgirl, like cowgirl is fine because
6582860	6585380	I'm a girl.
6585380	6588700	So I think that's awesome.
6588700	6595080	And there's apparently other bits of dialogue in the game, but Arc System is really sticking
6595080	6597820	with this translation and they're doing a great, a great job.
6597820	6598820	Yeah.
6598820	6600980	Sounds like they've done some really good course correcting there.
6600980	6605620	I know this, this kind of was first came up like a week or two ago when people were downloading
6605620	6610100	that DLC, but it's nice that the company's kind of confirming it and, you know, giving
6610100	6611580	that extra insight there.
6611580	6612580	Pretty cool.
6612580	6622460	And then also there's still, there's also the character of Testament who is a non-binary.
6622460	6631020	And this is both of the, both of their identities are built in now to the fabric of the story.
6631020	6646100	And then of course the scene has been uploaded onto Twitter and I will be reposting that
6646100	6648100	from my own Twitter.
6648100	6649100	Cool.
6649100	6650100	All right.
6650100	6653220	Well, I don't follow, I have to admit, I don't follow Guilty Gear as closely.
6653220	6657340	I just, I just haven't, I don't have time to play everything, but a fighting game franchise
6657340	6660500	I have been keeping my eyes on over the years is Mortal Kombat.
6660700	6665580	And with Mortal Kombat celebrating its 30th anniversary, we're finding out some more details,
6665580	6670900	just some behind the scenes stuff, which ironically in an interesting way, speaking of Dragon
6670900	6674580	Con coming up, Bobby has a really cool panel.
6674580	6680380	Bobby's getting to do a Mortal Kombat panel with, I forget, it's two of the mocap actors
6680380	6683660	from the original game that are going to be on the panel.
6683660	6687740	So, and I believe they had some hand, it's not like Ed Boon or anything.
6687740	6692540	It's, I think it's the brothers, Carlos, Pecina, and I can't remember the other guy's name,
6692540	6694420	but they're going to be on the panel.
6694420	6696180	And I think that's going to be a fun one to see.
6696180	6700100	So I'm hoping it doesn't conflict with any of my other panels so I can go watch it just
6700100	6703380	as a fan of Mortal Kombat, the old school games.
6703380	6708220	But Ed Boon has been dropping a lot of neat little things on Twitter and so forth, talking
6708220	6713620	this week about Sonya and how Sonya wasn't originally in the game, saying that on April
6713620	6718340	10th, they tested an unfinished version of Mortal Kombat with only six fighters at a
6718340	6725740	Chicago arcade called Times Square, the name of the arcade in Chicago, not New York, and
6725740	6728060	talking about basically how Sonya was made from there.
6728060	6735740	But Sonya started out as a character named Curtis Stryker, but they changed Curtis Stryker
6735740	6740380	into Sonya Blade, but it ended up being the same backstory because they decided they wanted
6740380	6743740	that fighter to be female, so they did a pivot there.
6743740	6751140	But ironically, Curtis Stryker was basically Jax, so they did revisit that concept, but
6751140	6754700	they made him Jax and put him in Mortal Kombat 2.
6754700	6757620	And then, of course, you might go, well, wait a minute, isn't Stryker a name for Mortal
6757620	6758620	Kombat?
6758620	6759620	Yeah.
6759620	6763060	Then they used the name Stryker in Mortal Kombat 3.
6763060	6766940	So I just think that's kind of interesting how this original development for the character
6766940	6771620	kind of ended up getting split out amongst all these other Mortal Kombat characters,
6771620	6773660	but that's how development works sometimes.
6773660	6776260	So I just thought that was some pretty cool insight.
6776260	6782900	All right, let's move on, travel around the world for some release dates and see what
6782900	6786660	games will be celebrating some 30th anniversaries in 2052.
6786660	6790420	Loki, what's on the list tonight?

6878060	6881420	A crayon Shin-chan?
6881420	6884460	Looks like really bad artwork.
6884460	6889700	Not crayon Shin-chan, it's like, I don't know, maybe?
6889700	6894100	It's like slightly better than crayon, but yes, it's the same character.
6894100	6896100	Okay, gotcha.
6896100	6904940	Anomutinim, or Mutationim, I guess that's how you pronounce that, on Nintendo Switch,

6977260	6978380	It's a little lighter this week.
6978380	6981860	I seem to remember last week it was really, really packed, but this week we have just

7056260	7060500	Moving on to the second, the rest of these are all in the second, we have The Ascent
7060500	7062620	for PlayStation and Xbox.
7062620	7065220	For PlayStation and Switch, we have Super Bullet Break.
7065860	7069300	For the three, we have Lego Brawls.
7069300	7073220	For PlayStation, Last of Us Part 1.
7073220	7076420	And PlayStation and Switch, Made in Abyss.
7078420	7080180	All right.
7080180	7083460	We have a few more news stories for you guys, and then we'll be inviting your phone calls
7083460	7088420	over at vognetwork.com slash Discord in the green room.
7088420	7091540	We'll get to any emails and tweets if we have any of those.
7091540	7094660	But first, we have a few more stories for you.
7094660	7096260	Loki!
7096260	7104260	Yeah, so this is unfortunate news, but so there's a company called Toge Productions
7104260	7106740	and Mojiken Studio.
7106740	7110900	They had a point and click game coming out called A Space for the Unbound.
7111620	7120500	And they were in negotiation with PQ Games, who had published Galgun in the past, to have,
7120500	7123220	you know, publish that on consoles for them as well.
7123860	7127380	And they were also going to handle the publishing in western regions.
7128020	7136340	However, they've had to terminate their contract with PQ Games because there's been some manipulation
7136340	7140260	being done on behalf of PQ Games.
7140260	7149940	So some of the things that they had done to them, one, they had obtained a grant basically
7149940	7161060	for, it was a grant for an unnamed diversity fund, and they obtained it in PQ Games behalf,
7161060	7163380	but then they withheld the money from them.
7164820	7171700	Then also, they had tried using those funds as part of a negotiation tactic with them.
7172420	7177700	So rather than giving them the money, they were hiding the fact that the grant had been
7177700	7184180	awarded to them and added as recoupable minimum guarantee, and then used it to negotiate the
7184180	7185860	increase of their revenue share.
7187300	7192500	Also, PQ Games is refusing to grant them control over publishing again.
7193300	7196580	So unfortunately, the game's kind of in limbo right now.
7196580	7202420	But the company wants to make arrangements and ensure that it's published as intended
7202420	7205540	in a way that's consistent with their community values.
7208100	7211380	So yeah, that sounds like a lot of drama there.
7214020	7219460	It says, the support has included offering a significant further funding over and above
7219460	7223140	the grant funding to support development, importing, and marketing.
7223780	7229860	This touch productions have sought for some time to unitally enforce the unreasonable
7230820	7236420	revised terms of our agreement, and it's disappointing that as a result not achieving
7236420	7240980	that, that despite PQ significant efforts to accommodate this, they have sought the
7240980	7243060	deal with a matter this way.
7243060	7246900	So basically, PQ is trying to say that, oh, we're not involved in that.
7246900	7251780	Yeah, like, how dare they go public with this, you know, trying to make us look bad to try
7251780	7253460	to resolve it this way, you know, in the
7254100	7258100	sure that, yeah, it's in their best interest to, you know, small indies, it's in their
7258100	7263940	best interest to try to piss off the publisher of their game, you know, and to try to throw
7263940	7267140	them under the bus and shade them with untrue facts.
7267140	7268820	I'm sure that's really what they're trying to do.
7269700	7270580	Yeah, I don't think so.
7271220	7271780	Okay.
7271780	7276820	So I think the developers have also said that if they did go forward with the publishing
7278020	7283940	through PQ, it says, or it says, oh, yeah, apparently players, of course, have decided
7283940	7287620	to review bomb PQ for doing stuff like that.
7287620	7290260	So, all right.
7291300	7293380	All right, well, we'll move on to our next story.
7293940	7298420	Dark Sakura had to step away for just a moment, so she'll come back to her thing at another
7298420	7299220	time.
7299220	7303140	So we'll move on to this story, which actually, I'm sorry, is also from Loki.
7303140	7304500	We'll skip right back to you, Loki.
7305060	7305700	All right, cool.
7306340	7312980	So there's some leaked game, well, very brief gameplay from apparently a new Need for Speed
7312980	7314660	title that has appeared online.
7315300	7320580	It has, well, I mean, they haven't really announced a new Need for Speed game, but apparently
7320580	7328660	it shows some footage of a, a barrel, a Bel Air crashing into some sort of donut shaped
7328660	7331460	monument and like some of the art style and stuff with that.
7332900	7337940	They said that the new Need for Speed would kind of combine like, you know, of photorealistic
7337940	7341060	and then like kind of, they say anime elements.
7341060	7347220	It's sort of like kind of graffiti almost elements to it, I guess.
7348180	7348820	It's neat.
7348900	7351220	It's a neat, uh, art style, I guess.
7351220	7355060	But, um, yeah, I don't know.
7356660	7358980	I'll be interested to see when they fully announce it.
7358980	7360100	It doesn't tell us much, right?
7360100	7361300	Open world though.
7361300	7365140	Like, I mean, the way they kind of make it look, it looks open world and I'm all about
7365140	7369380	an open world, like raising a game, like, uh, whether it be Need for Speed, kind of like
7369380	7374020	Need for Speed, I think underground was open world, but, um, whether it be like that or
7374020	7376580	like Burnout Paradise or something like that, I'm all down for that.
7376900	7381860	Uh, I guess we'll have to wait and see whenever the hell they announce it.
7381860	7382500	All right.
7382500	7382900	We'll see.
7383860	7384420	All right.
7384420	7388580	And, uh, one more story for you tonight that is a little bit of a follow up to something
7388580	7389940	we talked about last week.
7389940	7393620	Um, last week I think Dark Soccer had brought up that unfortunately, um, a developer of
7393620	7397700	some games that were published on Steam had passed away and that was, um, Rob Hale and,
7397700	7402740	uh, the games that, um, he had developed, Waves and Waves 2, uh, ended up being given
7402740	7407860	away on Steam, uh, as kind of like a tribute, you know, basically a post post-mortem.
7407860	7412660	Um, and, uh, the interesting thing that's happened as a result of that, that I wanted
7412660	7419620	to bring up tonight is that, uh, now a lot of fans are through Steam and through the
7419620	7424180	review system, leaving like basically positive review bombing.
7424180	7427060	Although I wouldn't call it review bombing because usually that's done with the intent
7427060	7428020	to alter the score.
7428020	7431940	I would say this is coming from a much different place where people are leaving their thank
7431940	7435380	yous and their memories and so forth as, you know, Steam reviews.
7435380	7439700	Uh, as of right now, Waves and Waves 2 have very positive ratings.
7439700	7443780	Uh, and actually it should be noted they had those ratings before he passed too.
7443780	7448900	So it should be clear this is not just a result of, uh, the game going free and so forth.
7448900	7454820	Um, so, you know, a lot of people saying things like F-cancer, uh, RIP, you know, the typical
7454820	7458580	things you would expect, um, to read, but, uh, yeah, just kind of interesting how that's
7458580	7462340	sort of turned into a virtual memorial of sorts for the developer.
7462340	7466260	Um, and, uh, you know, and I kind of talked about this last week on the show when, when
7466260	7470420	Jamie originally brought up the story is it's one of those, you know, the, the art that
7470420	7474100	you will leave behind and the lasting impact that it has on this world.
7474100	7479540	Um, and it's, it's very clear that this gentleman, you know, put a lot into these games and now
7479540	7486020	there's a lot of people that are appreciative and able to, um, you know, enjoy it, enjoy
7486020	7489460	his work and, uh, have be impacted by art.
7489460	7495700	It is unfortunate that he had to pass away for the game to get all the, um, you know,
7495700	7497540	traction and publicity that it has.
7498100	7503860	But, um, it's, it's, it's nice that at the end of the day, more people are able to play
7503860	7506980	it and, um, are, are feeling so positive about it.
7506980	7512180	Um, this pod culture says in chat review boosting, I wouldn't even, you know, again, you, you,
7512180	7516900	yes, but no, you know, those terms are usually reserved for artificial types of things.
7516900	7520340	Um, and I, again, I think what we're talking about tonight is very organic.
7520340	7524660	Um, so you're, you're not wrong, but also I just, I just don't like using those labels
7524660	7530260	that typically go for things like, you know, like Amazon sellers paying you to boost reviews
7530260	7530820	and stuff like that.
7530820	7532660	This is obviously from a much different place.
7532660	7536820	Um, and I thought it was just a nice little follow-up, uh, and a reminder, if you haven't
7536820	7541940	picked up waves or waves to Nash chance, they're free on steam.
7542180	7543060	All right.
7543060	7548180	With that, we move into the listener round table tonight, and we welcome your calls over
7548180	7550900	at vog network.com slash discord.
7550900	7553780	Uh, you can join the green room if you'd like to be on the show tonight and we'll get to
7553780	7554820	some of your calls.
7554820	7560580	We would usually also get to your emails, but I believe we don't have any tonight.
7560580	7563380	At least last I checked, we didn't have any emails.
7563380	7565380	So let's say, that's what I thought.
7565380	7568740	So, uh, participate at orange laundry.com.
7569540	7572100	If you want to send us an email for a future week.
7572100	7577540	Uh, meanwhile, I will mention on Twitter because there's a, I know there was a follow-up to
7577540	7581140	last week's email because Ziba tweeted, I don't remember.
7581140	7583140	She just tweeted at me or she tweeted the OLR account.
7583140	7585060	She might've just tweeted it at me, but I'm going to repeat it.
7585060	7590260	Anyway, that presentation of clue that's happening in final fantasy is getting delayed.
7590260	7592020	They had to push it back a week.
7592020	7595060	So now I really can't see it because I'm going to be at dragon con.
7595060	7596900	It was supposed to be this last Saturday.
7596900	7602180	They pushed it back a week because the island sanctuary is so popular.
7602180	7607380	It's been hosing the servers and people are having problems getting into the housing wards.
7607380	7612900	So, uh, it's not like, it's not as bad as some of the server problems they've had, but
7612900	7617860	I think the people putting on this play kind of knew it's just going to make a bad situation
7617860	7619540	worse if we overdo that.
7619540	7620980	So they pushed it out a week.
7620980	7624580	So unfortunately I will have to wait and see the YouTube for that, um, which I really hope
7624580	7627700	somebody puts on YouTube or at least a VOD or something like that.
7627700	7629380	Cause I'd really love to see that.
7629940	7631780	At some point it sounds really cool.
7631780	7635700	So, um, but that's it for emails and tweets.
7635700	7639540	Um, but let me go to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories tonight.
7639540	7643220	Maybe I did have one thing that's just a fun little mention.
7643220	7648980	So there is a brand new mod for Spiderman for PC.
7648980	7650500	Cause you gotta love those Spiderman.
7650500	7654500	Oh no, not after last week, but I, if you're bringing it up, then this one's got to be
7654980	7656260	better than the tone from last week.
7656260	7658420	It allows you to play as Kermit the Frog.
7661700	7662740	And it looks amazing.
7663620	7665380	To which I would say, yay!
7667700	7668740	Time for the flail.
7672580	7676020	As the show on her mountain chat says, yes, that mod is amazing.
7676020	7676420	So yes.
7676980	7679860	Questbuster chat says your friendly neighborhood frog.
7679860	7680360	Yes.
7681320	7687640	They, then there's of course other ridiculously borderline offensive mods where like, it's
7687640	7692440	not like offensive bad, like kind of like really, uh, where someone has modded uncle
7692440	7696600	Ben's gravestone as your playable character and it's remastered.
7698120	7699160	It's just stupid.
7699880	7704920	It's yeah, it's probably in poor taste, but a very different type of poor taste than what
7704920	7706280	we were talking about last week.
7706280	7708680	So the current, the frog though, that's, that's hilarious.
7708680	7709880	Yeah, no, I love that.
7709880	7713640	That's, that's, that's the absurdest shit that mods are for.
7713640	7714760	Thank you very much.
7714760	7715480	Me, Kermit.
7717560	7721640	I can't, I couldn't help but start thinking of the, uh, sense of me a street.
7722440	7723160	Listen, frog.
7724520	7725020	Kermit!
7726520	7727560	And the number R.
7730600	7733560	Um, oh, S2100Matt had said something about this to me on Twitter.
7733560	7737240	Since we didn't get emails tonight, we can do drag race talk and believe it.
7737240	7739640	S2100Matt is bringing up drag race.
7739960	7746760	So SSJ100Matt says, speaking of drag race, Sarah Nurse, who is a Canadian hockey star
7746760	7753160	and is a guest judge on Canadian drag race is now the first woman to be on an NHL game
7753160	7755240	cover with another player.
7755240	7761000	Well, we're going to give the gold star of the night to SSJ100Matt for being the first
7761000	7766120	listener in recent memory anyway, that has successfully connected drag race to video
7766120	7766840	games.
7766840	7767720	Thank you.
7767720	7772680	And actually made drag race a relevant topic of discussion here on Orange Lawn's radio.
7772680	7773800	Kudos to you.
7773800	7775080	I will take a step back though.
7775080	7777400	And there was the drag queen fighting game that we brought up.
7777400	7777880	There was.
7777880	7781880	That's why I said in recent memory and not that a listener brought up.
7781880	7783560	And hockey and hockey and hockey.
7783560	7784040	That's true.
7784040	7784680	That's true.
7784680	7785240	You've tied all this.
7786280	7792440	So though I can tell you now that it's been a week out, uh, for celebrity drag race.
7792440	7796120	I didn't watch this last episode yet, but I was shook last week.
7797000	7798760	Because you know who it was?
7799320	7800200	I, I heard.
7800200	7800360	Yeah.
7800360	7802440	Well, I haven't watched, but I get spoiled on Twitter.
7803000	7804040	So I can say it.
7804040	7804280	Sure.
7804280	7804680	Why not?
7805240	7806600	It was Taylor Dane.
7806600	7808040	I'm like, Holy shit.
7808040	7811160	I had a feeling it was, it was like a nineties singer.
7811160	7814840	It's like that the voice she carries herself, that could be Taylor Dane.
7814840	7817880	And I was like, Oh, although I know who a few of the others are.
7817880	7820920	So I'm just saying, I'm pretty sure I know who they are.
7820920	7821160	Taylor.
7821160	7822680	Day was on the mass singer recently too.
7822680	7823640	She didn't win.
7823640	7828520	But, um, it's nice to see her making a comeback of sorts on all these C-list reality shows.
7828520	7833720	Cause I always wondered like she was, she was huge in the nineties and like disappeared.
7834600	7835640	Um, what?
7835640	7836920	I had to do a sad thing though.
7836920	7839160	I had to tell Elsie who new kids on the block were.
7839960	7840440	Oh no.
7842120	7843480	Oh, kids today.
7844280	7845160	Kids today.
7850120	7852200	But I love, I love Taylor Dane.
7852200	7856920	And if you've never heard the comic, um, and she's on star Trek too.
7856920	7859320	Randomly, Tig Notaro, you probably know who she is.
7859320	7859720	You know her.
7859720	7866120	If you saw her very famous, um, lesbian comic has this whole routine around Taylor Dane.
7866120	7866840	That's great.
7866840	7868760	And it's on YouTube and it's definitely worth a listen.
7869400	7870840	Oh, Rob, tell it to my heart.
7874200	7875480	Tell it I'm the only one.
7875480	7877960	Is this really love or is it, is it just a game?
7877960	7878520	Just a game.
7879480	7883640	We, when I was, gosh, was I in early high school?
7883640	7884280	Hold on, hold on.
7884280	7884680	Loki.
7884680	7885800	Do you know who Taylor Dana is?
7888440	7892440	Love will lead you back someday.
7892440	7897480	I just know that love will lead you back to my heart.
7898520	7899080	Yes.
7899080	7899560	Okay.
7899560	7900440	Taylor Dane, you ain't.
7901000	7901560	No, I'm not.
7904040	7906360	Can you believe I don't play karaoke games on stream?
7909240	7914600	I remember the one time I asked you to sing something at karaoke and I forgot that.
7914600	7916920	I didn't realize that it wasn't quite in your range.
7917480	7921400	I forgot how much that, uh, bird house in your soul has a weird key.
7921400	7921800	Oh yeah.
7921800	7922600	It doesn't have a weird key.
7922600	7923000	Yeah.
7923000	7928600	That was the last song I ever asked you to sing karaoke for me, uh, faces before they
7928600	7934360	started getting, you know, I, I, my go to, um, karaoke songs.
7935000	7937160	Are hand in my pocket by Alanis Morissette.
7937160	7939480	And I can pretty much see anything off a jagged little pill.
7939480	7942200	And I don't even need the words on the screen, uh, or ABBA.
7944200	7945400	What can I, what can I say?
7946360	7951960	Mine are band on the run by Paul McCartney and wings, but I love that song.
7951960	7952520	This is fun.
7952520	7953800	It's like three songs in one.
7955000	7957720	And, um, yeah.
7957720	7963160	And, um, she's trapped in here with me or am I trapped in here with her?
7963960	7967560	But, um, also, uh, lady fingers by Luscious Jackson.
7967560	7968280	Oh, that's a good song.
7968280	7969320	I love that song.
7969320	7969960	Yeah.
7969960	7971480	Those are like my big two.
7971480	7979880	Although I was in my car, I made myself a nineties, uh, girl playlist and I was belting
7979880	7982040	out crucify today and that might become my new song.
7983080	7983400	All right.
7983400	7984440	I love Tori Amos.
7985560	7992120	Cause you know, she was the, the, uh, tree in, uh, starstruck the beginning in the book.
7993160	7993800	She was the tree.
7994680	7995400	All right.
7995400	8001080	Well on those completely random tangent notes, let's go ahead and end this where it began
8001080	8001960	with tangents.
8001960	8005640	Uh, but before we get to our final thoughts, I want to say thank you as always for listening

8076280	8081240	So there's a lot of weight and you need a meat shield will be your meat shield.

8081560	8082520	There you go.
8082520	8085320	Um, that's, that's, uh, that's it.
8085320	8086920	Uh, let's, let's wrap up.
8086920	8088360	We'll see you again in two weeks.
8088360	8089400	Let's get final thoughts.
8089400	8090200	Uh, dark soccer.
8090200	8092360	I will start with you cause I know you are going to go stream here in a moment.
8093480	8098680	So they released the patch notes coming up for the new chapter and everything.
8098680	8101640	And I still don't think that's going to stop the camping and tunneling situation.
8102200	8105080	They just need to make it to where the struggle timer stops.
8105960	8109560	Uh, in relation to proximity of killer to hook in the story.
8109560	8110060	I agree.
8111240	8111740	All right.
8112440	8113080	Have a good one.
8113080	8115320	Happy surviving later tater.
8115320	8115960	All right.
8115960	8118280	And let's go to Loki and your final thought tonight.
8119000	8121720	Uh, I'm hoping to get an episode out this week.
8121720	8122920	It's been a while.
8122920	8126200	It's been a few weeks, but that's because I'm building a very large build.
8127000	8129880	It is the large it's large.
8129880	8130680	It's very large.
8132120	8135400	Uh, my final thought is I cannot wait for dragon con.
8135400	8137480	I'm so excited to be back home.
8137480	8140200	I know it's going to be another kind of kind of weird year.
8140200	8142680	Last year was a really weird year, but I still had a lot of fun.
8142680	8144600	This year is going to be kind of a weird year.
8145160	8147720	But we're, we're slowly getting back to what it used to be.
8147720	8150680	I hope everybody has a great and safe dragon con.
8150680	8151880	Can't wait to meet people.
8151880	8153720	And I hope whatever you're doing labor day weekend.
8153720	8157640	I know I won't shut up about dragon con cause that's what I do, but whatever you do during
8157640	8159480	labor day weekend, I hope you have a good one.
8159480	8160520	I hope you have a lot of fun.
8161320	8162440	Stay safe.
8162440	8166520	And if nothing else, tell it to my heart.
8167080	8169000	Tell it I'm the only one.
8169000	8171720	Is this really love or just a game?
