WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.700
It's pronounced Koch Media.

00:12.700 --> 00:16.300
This week, we have a headline about Sunsoft announcing that they'll announce news this

00:16.300 --> 00:17.300
week!

00:17.300 --> 00:19.400
Seriously, that's the whole article.

00:19.400 --> 00:24.400
They included a single quote from the press release and the About Sunsoft block, and that's

00:24.400 --> 00:25.400
it.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.400
Yeah.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.240
This is just one headline before the headline.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.400
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

00:31.400 --> 00:35.080
their favorite memories of Sunsoft and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right

00:35.080 --> 00:38.080
now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.960
Jason, it's what we call a slow news week.

00:41.960 --> 00:44.040
Oh, hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:44.040 --> 00:48.280
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.660
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:50.660 --> 00:57.080
We are live with you once again for episode number 926 of our show for August the 14th

00:57.080 --> 00:58.760
of 2022.

00:58.760 --> 01:02.720
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined by my co-hosts.

01:02.720 --> 01:06.080
First off, showing off her merch and the hook of shame.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.960
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.440
I was actually just stretching.

01:10.440 --> 01:13.280
Oh, I thought you were doing a product placement.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.280
Well, how about that?

01:14.280 --> 01:18.520
How do you like my Pikachu I've got on my shirt here?

01:18.520 --> 01:19.680
Not my merch, though.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.960
I think Nintendo would shut me down immediately if I try, or a Pokemon company, if I tried

01:23.960 --> 01:24.960
to do a Pikachu shirt.

01:24.960 --> 01:31.080
Although I'm pretty sure I might be leaving my current merch location, so we'll see.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.080
You know what?

01:32.080 --> 01:33.800
We still have to set up a new VOG store.

01:33.800 --> 01:38.480
We kind of never really got around to that once we closed the old one, so lots to look

01:38.480 --> 01:39.480
forward to.

01:39.480 --> 01:43.040
There's another one that Elsie uses that I'm going to ask about that apparently they don't

01:43.040 --> 01:46.320
have as big of a selection, but they've got really good material.

01:46.320 --> 01:51.200
Okay, I'm all for like material and solid shirt, because you remember back in the day,

01:51.200 --> 01:53.200
and I'm not even sure if this company is still around.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.360
Was it Cafe-E-Press or Cafe-Press or something?

01:56.360 --> 01:59.120
It was called Cafe-Press, and they're still around.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.120
Oh, are they still around?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.120
Sorry.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.480
Now, disclaimer, I haven't used this site in like 10 years, but I just remember it was

02:04.480 --> 02:09.000
the first site that everybody would print their own shirts on, and it was a big printing

02:09.000 --> 02:10.240
on demand industry.

02:10.240 --> 02:16.240
Those shirts were terrible, because the logos would rub off the first time you washed the

02:16.240 --> 02:17.240
shirt.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.240
They did not last.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.800
I'm a fan of Redbubble.

02:21.880 --> 02:28.000
They have the ringer shirts now, and I think that that's really cool.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.800
I'm looking at Cafe-Press right now, and they have bumper stickers and different things,

02:34.800 --> 02:38.040
so I might look into that.

02:38.040 --> 02:42.440
Also joining us, Techmaster Loki, who's dying to say something here, what?

02:42.440 --> 02:43.880
Don't go to Redbubble.

02:43.880 --> 02:51.680
Their quality is very inconsistent, seriously, because our group, them with Channel 64, we

02:51.680 --> 02:55.560
were looking at doing merchandise, and Redbubble was one of the places that we looked at, and

02:55.560 --> 02:58.720
we ordered several shirts from them.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.540
Some were okay, some were terrible, and it was just inconsistent.

03:02.540 --> 03:04.240
The printing was offset.

03:04.240 --> 03:08.280
It wasn't just ... It was very inconsistent.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.280
It's a bummer.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.280
And not great.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.240
It's a bummer, because I actually like the quality of the shirts on the store we were

03:13.240 --> 03:18.920
at before, before everything went 180 over there, so it's unfortunate.

03:19.360 --> 03:25.200
Also, well, I use StreamElements when I stream, and I might check out their merch store.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.320
I'm looking around for reviews and stuff like that, so we'll see.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.760
Well, hey, you know what-

03:29.760 --> 03:31.200
Oh, we use StreamLabs, that's right.

03:31.200 --> 03:37.200
Once in a while, we get spammed with t-shirt stores, and usually I just kind of let them go,

03:37.200 --> 03:39.280
because I'm like, eh, they email all the podcasts.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.400
But you know what?

03:40.400 --> 03:48.320
If you want t-shirt shops, if you spam us this week and use the secret word ... What's

03:48.360 --> 03:49.400
the secret word?

03:49.400 --> 03:54.280
The secret word is rainbow, okay?

03:54.280 --> 03:54.920
If you use the secret-

03:54.920 --> 03:55.800
I don't know.

03:58.680 --> 04:04.040
If you use the secret word rainbow in your email, then I'll know it's not a spam email.

04:04.040 --> 04:09.880
So if you have a t-shirt store offer, send that over.

04:09.880 --> 04:10.360
All right.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.360
Oh, Jason suggested cookies.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.920
Okay, rainbow cookies, then I'll read every word.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.800
I just found something terrible out.

04:18.320 --> 04:18.720
What's that?

04:19.600 --> 04:24.560
That game that you were talking about on Bobby's show is on Mac.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.200
Oh, I'm going to be talking about it here tonight in a minute.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.720
Stay tuned for our gaming weeks.

04:28.720 --> 04:37.040
But first, let's get into the kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with a game that's

04:37.040 --> 04:40.160
coming out soon that I think a lot of people are looking forward to.

04:40.160 --> 04:46.880
I know I am, and it's Splatoon 3, and there was a direct for Splatoon 3 this week, and

04:46.880 --> 04:51.200
kind of culminated with the announcement of a Splatfest world premiere multiplayer

04:51.200 --> 04:53.120
demo on August 27th.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.640
There was a 30-minute Splatoon 3 direct video presentation.

04:56.640 --> 04:57.680
I'm going to be honest.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.120
I did not watch the whole thing.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.640
I skimmed it because those things come out too early in the day for me to watch the whole

05:02.640 --> 05:02.800
thing.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.760
I have to work and stuff.

05:05.120 --> 05:09.440
But I took a look at the highlights, and they kind of went over like, these are the

05:09.440 --> 05:11.360
characters that are going to be in the story.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.200
This is what the turf war is all about.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.640
Salmon Run is coming back.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.240
Here's some new stages.

05:16.240 --> 05:21.760
But what I thought was interesting is that this new Splatfests are going to be three.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.640
So you know how everything before was two.

05:26.640 --> 05:30.880
It was like, Ketchup and Mayonnaise was one of them.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.000
Well, as if there was any question which team I was on with that.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.320
The Ketchup and Mayonnaise was one of them.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.360
Oh, I'm trying to think of some of the other...

05:38.240 --> 05:41.600
Did they ever do over the roll or under the roll?

05:41.600 --> 05:43.520
I don't know if Splatoon ever did that.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.680
No, because they know that there's only one answer to that.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.480
There is no debate.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.680
But that or it's a hot dog, a sandwich.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.440
You know, those are the types of things that they would do in...

05:56.240 --> 06:00.480
Oh, Dark Tetsuya says that over under was actually a UK one, he thinks.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.920
I wouldn't be surprised, but it would be too controversial here.

06:03.920 --> 06:09.520
But anyway, the big twist is now they're three choices.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.720
So they're three teams because it's Splatoon 3, right?

06:12.720 --> 06:19.360
So the preview Splatfest is going to be Team Rock, Paper or Scissors.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.200
That's a hard one.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.360
I'm thinking I'm going to go with Team Scissors because, you know, we'll cut you.

06:26.400 --> 06:26.960
But I don't know.

06:26.960 --> 06:31.920
I could also see like Team Paper is going to write a bunch of shit about you.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.400
Team Rock, Rocks.

06:38.000 --> 06:38.720
I don't know.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.680
They're going to throw themselves at you.

06:41.680 --> 06:46.560
But Team Rock doesn't live in a glass house.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.120
You know, I don't know like what types of things.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.000
But, you know, people are going to get creative with those little banners that they're going

06:52.000 --> 06:53.360
to draw and that's the whole thing.

06:53.360 --> 06:58.880
But I thought that that meant, oh, then that means all these PVPs are going to be like

06:58.880 --> 07:00.400
three team maps now.

07:00.400 --> 07:04.880
That would be really cool because like Final Fantasy XIV's PVP has some of that and it

07:04.880 --> 07:06.560
lets you do some different stuff.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.840
But it's not really like that.

07:10.640 --> 07:15.840
So what happens is that in the first half of the Splatfest, it's still 4v4 turf war

07:15.840 --> 07:22.080
battles, but the second half now that's a tricolor turf war and the three teams all

07:22.080 --> 07:23.680
fight at the same time.

07:23.680 --> 07:30.560
But the first place team does a four in the center and the second and third place team

07:30.560 --> 07:34.480
do two and two in a pincher attack.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.120
So that's kind of interesting.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.200
So there is like tricolor matches.

07:39.200 --> 07:43.840
And I actually think that's kind of an interesting little twist on the formula is just why does

07:43.840 --> 07:44.960
it have to be just two teams?

07:44.960 --> 07:46.880
Why not three teams full of color?

07:46.880 --> 07:48.400
So I think that's going to be very interesting.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.640
That alone made me very interested in like, OK, that's kind of a very simple, but like

07:52.640 --> 07:54.560
it's going to it's going to lead to some new things.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.480
So, yeah, I'm excited to see kind of where that goes.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.720
They also are talking about new weapons.

08:02.720 --> 08:08.000
So there's a new bow, the tri stringer that can fire in three directions at once.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.320
There's a splatana wiper.

08:10.960 --> 08:17.120
So like not a katana, but a splatana where you throw ink basically by swinging the katana.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.160
Look, it's a video game.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.800
Don't try to put like actual physics and logic into it.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.440
It's how it works.

08:22.560 --> 08:28.400
And special weapons that you get after inking enough turf, including the tecta cooler where

08:28.400 --> 08:31.280
a fridge appears with stat boosting beverages.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.080
That's kind of fun.

08:32.080 --> 08:36.400
And I'm surprised they didn't try to do like a tie in with an actual drink there, a wave

08:36.400 --> 08:38.480
breaker for waves and so on and so on.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.960
It just sounds like it's going to be really neat.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.720
The lobby's back.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.120
Your friends appear as 3D holograms.

08:45.120 --> 08:49.200
You can join us an alley or drop out as an opponent.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.720
You know, whatever you need to do there.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.880
So it's just it's neat.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.080
And there's new amiibo coming.

08:54.880 --> 09:00.240
The yellow inkling, the blue octoling and a small fry will be there for fifteen ninety

09:00.240 --> 09:01.200
nine each.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.200
And if you scan the amiibo, you get to save gear combinations.

09:05.200 --> 09:09.360
And some amiibo, of course, have exclusive gear because they've got to convince you to

09:09.360 --> 09:10.800
keep buying all that stuff somehow.

09:11.440 --> 09:12.800
Also, one more thing.

09:12.800 --> 09:18.400
I mean, it was a 30 minute presentation after all at PAX West, which used to be PAX Prime,

09:18.400 --> 09:21.920
but now it's just PAX West because, you know, there's PAX East, PAX South.

09:21.920 --> 09:28.560
So PAX West on September 5th, the top players from the Splatoon 2 Inkopolis showdown will

09:28.560 --> 09:33.680
go to Seattle to complete in the first ever Splatoon 3 Invitational.

09:33.680 --> 09:40.160
I think that's kind of interesting because it just shows, again, Nintendo kind of just

09:40.160 --> 09:44.960
slithering a little more into that e-sports realm that I feel in part they've been very

09:44.960 --> 09:46.720
resistant to for a long time.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.480
But then, of course, we heard the news about what's that company, Panda, that they started

09:50.480 --> 09:55.680
teaming up with for the Super Smash Brothers official tournaments and all that stuff.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.680
So it's just it's just interesting to see Nintendo start to kind of go down that road

09:59.680 --> 10:03.680
a little more, even though they really should have got on board with e-sports some time

10:03.680 --> 10:04.000
ago.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.560
But, you know, better late than pregnant, I guess.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.400
So there's that.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.560
So I got that one.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.200
Dark Soccer.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.320
Just Dark Soccer.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.880
I count on you to always catch a Golden Girls reference.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.040
All right.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.360
Anyway, Loki, what did you think?

10:21.360 --> 10:25.360
Jamie, I don't know if you have thoughts, but either thoughts on Splatoon 3?

10:26.960 --> 10:27.760
I didn't watch it.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.640
I didn't play the second one.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.280
Like, I didn't really play the second one too much.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.640
I remember getting it, but like, I don't think I ever played it.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.240
Well, the weird.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.560
OK, so what was funny, I will say this.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.600
When I was at Target the other day, I was talking to Alan about Splatoon 3.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.320
I was like, oh, yeah, Splatoon 3 is like the next big release on the Switch.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.040
It's coming.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.160
And he cracked a joke.

10:50.160 --> 10:54.000
He said, oh, is that another one for them to support for six months before they pull

10:54.000 --> 10:54.960
the plug on it?

10:54.960 --> 10:57.680
And I was like, oh, wig.

10:57.680 --> 11:03.120
OK, like, we're here to read today because that is kind of what happened with Splatoon

11:03.120 --> 11:09.520
2 is that it wasn't supported quite as long as you would have thought, especially when

11:09.520 --> 11:12.480
you put it side by side with Mario Kart 8 right now.

11:12.480 --> 11:19.280
OK, so now granted, you know, the team went on to make Splatoon 3 and maybe they're just,

11:19.280 --> 11:21.680
you know, making the fully realized game there.

11:21.680 --> 11:26.720
But it is a decent read that like Splatoon 2 kind of came and went as far as the support

11:26.720 --> 11:27.220
goes.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.880
And Mike Dev said Splatoon 2 had two years of support, if I recall correctly.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.440
Fair enough.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.280
But it didn't seem like it was as long as number one, that's for sure.

11:37.280 --> 11:37.680
I don't know.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.400
It seemed like those flat fests didn't hang out quite as long.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.760
But, you know, perception is everything, whether it's the truth or not.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.000
Right.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
That's how it goes in the video game industry.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.440
So, yeah.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.280
I'll be perfectly honest right now.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.200
Dead by Daylight takes enough of my time.

11:52.480 --> 11:58.240
Well, you know, and that's for any kind of online multiplayer versus situation.

11:58.240 --> 12:05.680
Well, and that's like the ever going conundrum in gaming right now in general is that games

12:05.680 --> 12:10.560
as a service, which I would say in some ways Dead by Daylight is, because the constant

12:10.560 --> 12:15.360
DLC support, the constant patches, the battle passes, it's games as a service, right?

12:15.360 --> 12:15.600
Yeah.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.840
Never say behavior hasn't kept up with their product.

12:19.840 --> 12:25.680
But you could throw into that same bin things like Overwatch, Fortnite, Call of Duty, hell,

12:25.680 --> 12:28.160
anything with a battle pass really fits in that system.

12:28.160 --> 12:33.680
But because we invest so much time now in these games as a service, and I would say

12:33.680 --> 12:39.040
I'm just as guilty, not just Dead by Daylight, but like Final Fantasy 14, MMOs, the original

12:39.040 --> 12:40.720
game as a service, right?

12:40.720 --> 12:45.920
Like those games take so much of our time, that's what allows our backlogs to build up

12:45.920 --> 12:50.400
because we're so focused on staying on the cutting edge of, you know, whatever's being

12:50.400 --> 12:55.840
released in the battle pass and whatever our number one, our main game is.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.040
So it's just interesting.

12:59.040 --> 13:05.840
I feel like maybe it's Dead by Daylight for you, but a lot of people have this problem

13:05.840 --> 13:07.760
with some game out there.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.000
For Loki, it's Minecraft, you know?

13:10.560 --> 13:13.600
For me, it's Final Fantasy and a little bit of everything.

13:13.600 --> 13:18.320
So, and Bobby Blackwolf says, yeah, that's one of the reasons I did let my Final Fantasy

13:18.320 --> 13:19.840
14 sub lapse.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.800
And yeah, I have to force myself to play other games sometimes.

13:23.440 --> 13:27.600
Luckily, 14 is in a bit of a content lull right now because we're between patches.

13:28.640 --> 13:32.080
And the 14 team does a very good job staying on top of patches.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.400
So like they're not as bad as, wow.

13:34.400 --> 13:38.720
But, you know, we're still about two weeks out from the next Final Fantasy 14 patch.

13:38.720 --> 13:42.240
So I still have a good two weeks to get in, you know, a bunch of other games.

13:42.240 --> 13:47.920
But once that Final Fantasy 14 patch comes out, that's going to take over my gaming week

13:47.920 --> 13:51.040
for at least a month while I explore everything in that patch.

13:51.040 --> 13:57.760
And with that island sanctuary coming, they're putting like farm simulator into, I don't

13:57.760 --> 14:01.680
know if it's Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.880
I don't know which one of those they're going for in Final Fantasy, but they're putting

14:04.880 --> 14:06.400
one of those in that game.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.200
And that's going to be a time sink for sure.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.560
It's all of them.

14:10.560 --> 14:14.320
Yeah, so let's see.

14:14.320 --> 14:19.520
And Mike Deft bring in the receipts saying Splatoon, excuse me, Nintendo released Splatoon

14:19.520 --> 14:24.480
2's final significant update version 5.0 in July 2019.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.640
The update signaled the end of the game's post launch support, which continued for two

14:28.640 --> 14:31.040
years since the Switch shooters initial release.

14:31.040 --> 14:35.040
Well, I guess it did get longer support than most EA games.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.880
So let's give them a round of applause for that.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.080
You know, at least there is that.

14:38.080 --> 14:46.560
But again, it's still hard to look at Splatoon 2 next to like Mario Kart 8 or hell, what's

14:46.560 --> 14:49.520
another game that got DLC out of nowhere?

14:49.520 --> 14:53.440
There was a game not long ago that Nintendo just put out new DLC out of nowhere and it

14:53.440 --> 14:54.240
was like, what?

14:54.880 --> 14:57.760
Like they're doing this game again for some reason?

14:57.760 --> 14:58.880
Okay, cool.

14:58.880 --> 14:59.600
Like it just came out.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.960
I think it was Mario Kart 8.

15:00.960 --> 15:01.600
Was it Mario?

15:01.600 --> 15:05.120
I guess I thought there was another one that they did not that long ago where I was like,

15:05.120 --> 15:06.000
all right, cool.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.640
They decided to do something new for this game.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.040
And so maybe it was Mario Strikers.

15:11.040 --> 15:11.520
I don't know.

15:11.520 --> 15:16.240
But yeah, it was Mario Party because of the online content.

15:16.240 --> 15:20.240
They just suddenly one day were like, oh yeah, we're just going to patch in online play that

15:20.240 --> 15:21.360
everybody's been wanting.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.720
Like it was Mario Party.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.360
That's what I was thinking.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.600
Guys, we figured out what online was now.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.080
So, you know, one of our interns helped us out with that.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.240
Now we decided to go ahead and put it in the game.

15:31.040 --> 15:35.520
Anyway, I did not mean to talk down on Splatoon 2.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.640
I feel like I've ruffled the feathers of the Splatoon fans in chat.

15:38.640 --> 15:42.960
That's not what I was trying to do, but I'm excited for Splatoon 3.

15:42.960 --> 15:43.680
I am.

15:43.680 --> 15:50.000
I think I like it more than a lot of shooter games, to be honest, because I like the twist

15:50.000 --> 15:54.720
on the fact that it's not like, you know, trying to get headshots necessarily.

15:54.720 --> 15:59.600
I mean, I guess you can, but it's more about like the paint and the strategy of, you know,

15:59.600 --> 16:03.840
even if I don't necessarily want to go right after people, what is the best way for me

16:03.840 --> 16:07.200
to use my paint supply to have an impact on the team?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.280
You know, there's, there's, there's a different way to think about it.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.400
And I kind of, I kind of like that.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.840
And the whole like swimming is kind of a neat mechanic too.

16:13.840 --> 16:18.000
I just, there, there's, there's unique things that Splatoon brings to the table where I

16:18.000 --> 16:19.600
think it's really unfair to look at it.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.120
It's just, oh, it's a kid shooter.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.000
I think it has more depth than that.

16:24.080 --> 16:28.480
So, Phil of Nine in chat says, do not come for Splatoon, Rob.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.360
I've got my roller and my splat gun aimed at your booty.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.920
That's okay.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.760
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says, we can all agree.

16:39.760 --> 16:44.320
They're supporting all of these better than F-Zero right now as an actually releasing

16:44.320 --> 16:44.800
something.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.600
That hurt, but thank you.

16:48.720 --> 16:49.040
Ow.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.720
The truth hurts sometimes.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.920
The truth hurts.

16:51.920 --> 16:52.640
The truth hurts.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.960
We always hurt the ones we love.

16:54.960 --> 16:55.460
Right.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.840
Let's get into speaking of the things we love.

16:57.840 --> 17:03.120
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and probably those games as a service that has held our

17:03.120 --> 17:04.320
attention this week.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.600
Let's go with Dark Sakura.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.400
How was your gaming week?

17:08.000 --> 17:12.320
Well, I mentioned earlier, I started a Final Fantasy IV.

17:12.320 --> 17:18.880
I'm actually playing a translated copy, which I am entitled to do so because I own both

17:18.880 --> 17:21.040
the Japanese and the English versions.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.120
So I started with that.

17:25.120 --> 17:32.240
I forgot, though, like the difference in graphics between that one and six, even with five.

17:33.440 --> 17:38.960
So when I'm done with Final Fantasy IV, I will be moving on to Final Fantasy V so I

17:38.960 --> 17:39.840
can play as Butts.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.440
His name is Butts.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.680
Or Bartz.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.560
I always say Butts.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.960
Wasn't the unofficial translation Butts, so that's what most of us know.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.800
But it was supposed to be Bartz.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.760
Yeah, yeah, it's not like that.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.560
Which now makes me think of Berserk.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.800
But no, that was Gatsu.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.280
Never mind.

17:57.280 --> 18:03.360
Batsu is from Project Justice, our rival schools.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.840
Same, same, same series.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.640
I played a little bit more of Hooked on You.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.360
It's cute.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.080
I enjoy it.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.960
I just bought that Lamb game.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.600
I'm mad now.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.760
Why are you mad?

18:22.560 --> 18:26.240
Because I paid money for the full version.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.560
Would you say you've joined a cult?

18:30.160 --> 18:30.660
Never.

18:31.840 --> 18:32.340
Never.

18:32.880 --> 18:33.680
A gaming cult?

18:33.680 --> 18:34.880
I'm investigating a cult.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.840
She's starting a cult investigation podcast and she needs to be on the front lines.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.960
It's called What the Fuck Is This Game After All?

18:47.600 --> 18:51.440
I can't believe that there's a game called Max Gentlemen's Sexy Business, by the way.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.320
I just think that's funny.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.200
There's a lot of games.

18:53.200 --> 18:57.680
Somebody was just saying in our Discord before the show over at vog network dot com slash

18:57.680 --> 18:58.160
Discord.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.440
Oh, I can't bring it up.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.400
But because it'll make my co-host faces disappear.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.440
But it was something about like, like a furry fighter.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.320
So there's something really.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.560
It sounded interesting.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.160
Now I got to look it up.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.200
It's going to bother me if I.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.680
Corky in chat said over Discord at vog network dot com slash Discord said, I can't believe

19:19.680 --> 19:21.680
you missed this in the new releases last week.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.760
Linking to furry sex poker.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.320
That was it.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.800
And I'm like, you know what?

19:26.800 --> 19:30.080
Not every Steam game makes our release date calendar.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.840
And sometimes that's a blessing.

19:32.960 --> 19:37.760
Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I just don't think that's something we

19:37.760 --> 19:40.720
need to get into in this fine family program that we have.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.520
There's also just like too many Steam games, honestly.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.080
And they're all furry sex a little bit, aren't they?

19:46.640 --> 19:47.520
There's a lot of them.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.280
It's not anything new.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.280
It's true.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.600
Furry sex is not a new concept.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.680
Anyway, moving on.

19:55.680 --> 20:02.640
Well, anyway, there's also another game coming out that I super want called Vikings on Trampolines.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.320
And I'm really hoping that they do a Mac version.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.040
I actually left them some feedback hoping so.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.760
I also did some experimentation.

20:13.760 --> 20:18.000
So I'm not sure if you're familiar with an app called Crossover.

20:20.240 --> 20:29.440
But Crossover is a thing to play PC applications in general.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.480
Not play, but use PC applications on Mac OS.

20:32.480 --> 20:35.520
And they finally have the M1 update in there.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.080
So I installed Steam through that.

20:38.080 --> 20:42.880
And then I tried to do VHS, and it wouldn't run it.

20:43.760 --> 20:47.360
And so I tried to do Dead by Daylight, and it started to run it.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.960
It actually got past the anti-cheat.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.120
And then it was like, API error.

20:51.120 --> 20:58.080
But I'm like, so I'm kind of back to square one with some of my stuff.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.760
I need a good graphics card.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.560
So there's that experimentation.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.360
Do you want the graphics card for my old PC?

21:09.040 --> 21:11.040
Um, sure.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.560
How old is it?

21:12.560 --> 21:14.400
Um, five-ish years.

21:14.960 --> 21:15.840
Yeah, that could work.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.600
I mean, it's good enough to run Dead by Daylight.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.840
Yeah, I played Dead by Daylight on the old machine.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.400
I mean, it wasn't the best ever, but it worked.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.600
Sure, certainly worth giving a shot.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.080
That means then the only other thing that I'll need is

21:29.120 --> 21:31.120
I'll just have to get a new KVM switch

21:31.120 --> 21:33.760
so I can use my monitor and all my accessories.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.080
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

21:36.080 --> 21:36.480
Thank you.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.280
Yeah, sure, why not?

21:38.720 --> 21:47.680
Um, but, um, um, I am, I, and by the way, I have used GeForce.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.040
I much prefer Stadia for my streaming stuff.

21:51.600 --> 21:57.520
I used, the extent of me using GeForce was, I played a couple of things,

21:57.520 --> 22:03.440
but, um, mostly now it's just enough to load up my PC copy of Dead by Daylight

22:04.080 --> 22:09.360
so that I can log in and make sure that it's properly linked to my behavior account.

22:10.160 --> 22:16.880
Um, like my Stadia one is because, uh, those two have, uh, cross progression.

22:18.160 --> 22:25.200
So all of the, um, the many, many cosmetics I've bought and all of my achievements will

22:25.200 --> 22:26.800
carry over between both versions.

22:29.440 --> 22:32.720
Um, I have, I signed up for Luna.

22:33.040 --> 22:37.440
I actually was in the beta for Luna and it's all right.

22:37.440 --> 22:41.520
Um, but I don't recall Dead by Daylight being on there.

22:42.240 --> 22:42.800
I don't think it is.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.720
I don't think VHS is either.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.320
There's really nothing on there right now.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.920
I'm, I'm super interested in playing.

22:49.360 --> 22:54.800
Um, but, uh, as far as other things, I did beat Final Fantasy six earlier in the week.

22:56.160 --> 22:56.560
Yay.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.040
Congrats.

22:57.840 --> 23:03.120
And of course, uh, the only thing I did not do that I wish I had done was, you know, put

23:03.120 --> 23:08.240
the effort into giving Sid Goodfish so that he would live, but whatever.

23:09.040 --> 23:14.240
Um, and, uh, I played my word game.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.880
I'm like almost to like level 10,000.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.840
I'm not even kidding.

23:19.840 --> 23:20.960
I play that game a lot.

23:21.760 --> 23:24.640
Um, and then I did like some words on stream with people.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.840
I think that counts as a game.

23:25.840 --> 23:30.880
Cause that game is kind of fun, but I don't play it against most people because not to

23:30.880 --> 23:33.040
toot my own horn, but I'm really fucking good at it.

23:34.400 --> 23:37.920
And I want to be fair to other people.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.320
I don't want to monopolize all the points because I'm a word nerd.

23:42.320 --> 23:46.320
Well, I do like that we're playing a Scrabble against Bobby.

23:46.320 --> 23:50.160
I do like the words on stream has like a cool down.

23:50.160 --> 23:53.040
Like you can only get one word every so many seconds.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.200
So it's, it's hard to monopolize things.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.560
When the majority of people are misspelling simple words.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.040
Oh yeah.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.640
Then, you know, well that's, yeah.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.080
Got to look for those red underlines.

24:03.440 --> 24:03.760
Yeah.

24:03.760 --> 24:08.320
Well, I mean, I don't know that they even care or see them, but it is what it is.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.760
But anyway, that that's been most of my gaming.

24:13.760 --> 24:14.240
Oh yeah.

24:14.240 --> 24:18.560
And I did play, uh, some doctor who, and I played some world cup soccer.

24:19.920 --> 24:20.160
All right.

24:20.320 --> 24:25.520
For the record, the, the, uh, the clothing site is fourth wall.

24:25.520 --> 24:26.400
Elsie just told me.

24:26.960 --> 24:27.440
Oh, okay.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.000
Well, I'll look into it.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.160
Um, or you look into it and tell me how it is.

24:33.520 --> 24:33.840
All right.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.600
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

24:36.560 --> 24:38.320
It's all Minecraft again.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.920
That's, that's what I've been playing.

24:39.920 --> 24:45.200
So put out a new episode, uh, earlier this week and just been kind of figuring out what

24:45.200 --> 24:45.700
I want to do.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.160
It's the typical cycle.

24:48.800 --> 24:49.520
All right.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.000
Fair enough.

24:50.160 --> 24:53.680
What about the game plan behind you tonight on stream as we, uh, I don't think I've said

24:53.680 --> 24:58.080
the typical plug yet as we do tape live every Sunday night, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock

24:58.080 --> 25:01.440
Pacific at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

25:01.440 --> 25:04.800
That's VOG network right after the Bobby black will show.

25:05.360 --> 25:10.320
Who was talking about an amazing book series about, I I'm not going to get into the whole

25:10.320 --> 25:14.160
thing or repeat the whole story, but it was like basically like learning to program basic

25:14.160 --> 25:17.600
by like participating in a second person book series.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.440
And you became like, it was really fascinating to me and I'm like, I wanted those books and

25:21.440 --> 25:21.920
I was a kid.

25:21.920 --> 25:22.560
Where were those?

25:22.560 --> 25:25.200
Anyway, go, go listen to Bobby if you want to hear more about that.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.720
Um, but what's the game plan behind you looking.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.720
So it's a game called writing fights.

25:31.280 --> 25:35.920
Um, no particular reason other than I saw it when I was looking for long plays of stuff

25:35.920 --> 25:37.280
and it looked weird.

25:37.280 --> 25:41.200
It's like, you know how every single one of those fighting games or not really fighting

25:41.200 --> 25:44.960
is beat them up games had that level where you're on like a hoverboard or something like

25:44.960 --> 25:45.200
that.

25:45.200 --> 25:49.840
It was, it was like, Oh, you're on a hoverboard, but it really, it's just the same gameplay

25:49.840 --> 25:50.160
again.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.840
It's the mode seven level.

25:51.840 --> 25:55.600
There's always going to be a mode seven level in any like super Nintendo game.

25:55.600 --> 25:56.080
Exactly.

25:56.080 --> 26:00.240
So this entire game is basically that, but what's funny though is like, you're actually,

26:00.240 --> 26:03.920
you can like fight, um, cars and stuff like that.

26:03.920 --> 26:04.960
It's just ridiculous.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.080
Okay.

26:06.080 --> 26:06.880
It looked weird.

26:06.880 --> 26:07.280
Good times.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.240
Oh, I picked it.

26:08.960 --> 26:09.280
All right.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.960
Uh, let's see my gaming week.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.000
So, um, okay.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.240
So I, I've been teasing it enough.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.640
I also played cult of the lamb for the first time.

26:16.640 --> 26:20.400
I had to play something new this week because I was going to be coming into this show again,

26:20.400 --> 26:22.560
going, I played some more dead by daylight.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.400
I played some more Final Fantasy 14.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.920
I play all the same shit I always play, but I was like, all right, I want to play something

26:27.920 --> 26:28.240
new.

26:28.240 --> 26:34.000
So I checked out this cult of the lamb game because I had heard the talk about, Oh, it's

26:34.000 --> 26:39.280
like animal crossing, but instead of animal crossing cute characters, you're trying to

26:39.280 --> 26:40.720
get them all to join a cult.

26:40.720 --> 26:44.880
And if they like try to disobey you, you kill them and you bury them in the back of

26:44.880 --> 26:46.880
the compound.

26:46.880 --> 26:47.200
No.

26:47.200 --> 26:47.680
Well, okay.

26:47.680 --> 26:48.880
So here's the thing.

26:48.880 --> 26:55.120
I think that headline about the, um, animal crossing ask element of it that came from

26:55.120 --> 26:58.640
a Kotaku article getting my hands on the game.

26:58.640 --> 27:01.360
I actually don't think it's really, it's, it's like animal crossing.

27:01.360 --> 27:04.800
The only thing it has in common with animal crossing is this cute animal characters.

27:04.800 --> 27:05.440
I think that's it.

27:05.440 --> 27:05.680
Yeah.

27:05.680 --> 27:06.000
Yeah.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.320
The game itself feels a little more like the binding of Isaac.

27:10.320 --> 27:15.920
I think would be a good comparison for the, um, rogue like element meets don't starve

27:15.920 --> 27:19.040
for the crafting element and kind of building the village area.

27:19.040 --> 27:22.720
And that's the part that I think people are comparing a little bit to animal crossing,

27:22.720 --> 27:26.320
but I'm like, I feel like animal crossing.

27:26.320 --> 27:30.800
No, like it's just, I don't know how to explain it, but it's just a totally different vibe

27:30.800 --> 27:31.840
in animal crossing.

27:31.840 --> 27:37.200
Uh, this game, obviously the whole like cute characters joining a cult.

27:37.200 --> 27:42.240
I mean, it's, it's, it's selling the game on concept really.

27:42.240 --> 27:47.520
Cause I'm going to be honest, like the, the rogue like park part and the city building

27:47.520 --> 27:52.240
part are not particularly novel games, either one of them.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.120
They're not doing anything the genre hasn't seen before.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.720
It's just the way they're doing it and the way they're implementing it.

27:58.720 --> 28:04.720
And I will say, I think one of the smartest big brain things the developers did, and I'm

28:04.720 --> 28:07.520
not saying, by the way, I want to make this very clear.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.440
I'm not saying that makes it a bad game.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.760
No, of course not.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.000
Like comfort food is comfort food.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
Sometimes relying on these old tricks and old genres is a great thing.

28:18.560 --> 28:22.480
I think the big brain stuff these developers did were all the Twitch integrations that

28:22.480 --> 28:27.200
they did, which if I'm not mistaken, allow the followers to be people that are watching

28:27.200 --> 28:27.840
your channel.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.960
It's it's simple, but it's brilliant.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.560
It's fucking brilliant because I'll tell you, I'm looking at my Twitch list right

28:34.560 --> 28:34.960
now.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.560
There's three people streaming that game.

28:37.120 --> 28:41.360
Nobody knew about this game two weeks ago, and now it's becoming the hot, the hot new

28:42.080 --> 28:43.440
must have on Twitch.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.960
I know it's getting through the Dead by Daylight community.

28:46.960 --> 28:51.120
Cause that has to be how Dark Sakura saw it on Twitch and got convinced to buy it once

28:51.120 --> 28:52.560
she saw it ran on her system.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.120
I don't know.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.800
That's or was it something else?

28:56.800 --> 28:58.720
It was literally you mentioning it.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.880
Oh, my impact.

29:00.880 --> 29:01.280
Thank you.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.960
Well, I saw that it runs on Mac.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.320
I was like, okay, I'll do it.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.840
I'm supporting more companies that are doing content for Mac.

29:09.840 --> 29:10.400
Fair.

29:10.400 --> 29:14.800
I did see Isaaco streaming it last night, so I figured maybe he's seen them streaming

29:14.800 --> 29:15.200
it or something.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.960
I know there's been other DVD streamers have played.

29:16.960 --> 29:23.040
I started playing at 8 30 and stopped streaming at two in the morning, which for me is unheard

29:23.040 --> 29:23.520
of.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.240
That's pretty late.

29:25.280 --> 29:25.760
Yeah.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.960
And by the time I went to bed, I just super passed out.

29:28.960 --> 29:33.760
And like, if not for Dan waking me up, I probably would have kept sleeping.

29:33.760 --> 29:34.260
Yeah.

29:35.520 --> 29:35.840
Let's see.

29:35.840 --> 29:39.120
Fifth Dream in chat says one of my animals asked me if he could eat some poop.

29:39.120 --> 29:41.040
So I cooked him a bowl of poop and he ate it.

29:41.040 --> 29:41.760
Quest complete.

29:42.320 --> 29:46.400
It's those types of the face Dark Sakura just made.

29:46.960 --> 29:47.520
I'm sorry.

29:48.080 --> 29:48.320
Sorry.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.720
I had to explain that for the podcast, folks.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.560
But yeah, yeah, I guess that is something.

29:53.120 --> 29:58.960
Well, but I guess, you know, cleaning up your cult members poop is part of the game.

29:58.960 --> 30:03.040
And that's I didn't know you could feed it back to them.

30:03.040 --> 30:03.360
That's.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.360
Well, many animals eat their own crap.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.400
I guess so.

30:07.280 --> 30:07.680
All right.

30:07.680 --> 30:11.520
There's a lot of people who will eat their own crap.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.360
And I mean that metaphorically.

30:13.360 --> 30:18.560
But it's wild shit like that, literally, which is why everybody's talking about this game

30:18.560 --> 30:25.040
right now, because again, the the the game element of the game is is for all intents

30:25.040 --> 30:27.920
and purposes, a tired formula at this point.

30:27.920 --> 30:31.200
It's like a roguelike and a sim game.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.080
What a tired fucking formula format at this point.

30:35.520 --> 30:41.840
But this game pulls it off because it says, well, what if we do something really sick

30:41.840 --> 30:42.880
and twisted with it?

30:44.240 --> 30:44.740
Yes.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.080
That's it.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.360
That's that's the guy.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.680
Any original ideas anymore?

30:49.680 --> 30:52.160
Just original executions.

30:52.160 --> 30:52.400
Yeah.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.760
And that and that's what it is.

30:53.760 --> 30:54.960
It's the execution.

30:54.960 --> 30:59.440
It's the building in that Twitch integration from the because I believe this game is still

30:59.440 --> 31:00.560
early access.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.360
So it's literally Twitch integration at the ground level.

31:03.360 --> 31:08.080
And I saw it was called out in chat that the Twitch stuff is still buggy.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.120
Of course it is.

31:09.120 --> 31:13.520
But it doesn't matter that type of stuff, especially like, you know, being able to have

31:13.600 --> 31:20.240
your viewers be in your village and cooking dishes for them and all that stuff like that

31:20.240 --> 31:20.960
is funny.

31:20.960 --> 31:24.960
And that is, you know, that is building community one way or another.

31:24.960 --> 31:28.960
So it's it's just like the execution of it.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.480
I think it's a very good way to put it.

31:31.360 --> 31:37.120
The genre tired, been done better before the execution, a plus.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.200
That's that's where they've nailed it.

31:39.200 --> 31:39.840
That's what it is.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.720
So that was my thoughts on Cult of the Lamb.

31:43.440 --> 31:48.160
The only other new ish thing I did this week, so Loki to follow up on your stories from

31:48.160 --> 31:53.360
last week, I went to round one locally on Friday, so I got to see the new round one.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.160
It was it was OK.

31:56.160 --> 32:00.720
But also, I think because you said this to the BeatMania 2DX machines, one of them was

32:00.720 --> 32:02.880
broken and it was in pieces.

32:02.880 --> 32:07.360
Like literally they're they're trying to it looked like to me that they're trying to

32:07.360 --> 32:13.360
replace the because it has the old school levers on it and the other machine has the

32:13.360 --> 32:18.720
actual touch pad that the newer 2DX machines have for all the equalizer and all the additional

32:18.720 --> 32:19.520
functionality.

32:19.520 --> 32:23.120
It looked to me like they're trying to switch the old one to one of those or something.

32:23.120 --> 32:26.400
But it just maybe it surprised me that it was so broken the first week.

32:27.280 --> 32:31.600
Otherwise, like I'm just my back was super hurting and I don't know why I must have pulled

32:31.600 --> 32:33.120
a muscle in it on Friday or something.

32:33.120 --> 32:37.440
So like there was no way I really wanted to play DDR and take a picture and send it to

32:37.440 --> 32:38.000
YYR.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.240
But the way my back was feeling, that was not going to happen.

32:40.240 --> 32:43.520
And there was too many people around where I didn't even want to play the easy stuff.

32:43.520 --> 32:48.000
But I did play some BeatMania 2DX and Shane was making fun of me because I was playing

32:48.000 --> 32:50.320
Boomer songs in 2DX, but I don't care.

32:50.320 --> 32:54.080
I'm yes, I am going to play Burning Heat from 7th style.

32:54.080 --> 32:59.920
And I think I think I played Rizlim from 5th style or 4th style like I was playing old

32:59.920 --> 33:00.400
shit.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.280
And yes, I love.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.640
But the problem is my skill level has regressed completely.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.680
Like I failed.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.840
I did In My Eyes.

33:07.840 --> 33:08.720
You remember that song?

33:09.920 --> 33:13.040
In my eyes.

33:13.040 --> 33:17.680
So I have some complicated note patterns, but that song used to be like easy.

33:17.680 --> 33:18.640
I failed it.

33:19.280 --> 33:23.680
I was like, OMG, this is sad, but it's just going to take practice.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.720
Otherwise, the round one itself was fine.

33:26.720 --> 33:30.320
I didn't love how they had all the music games shoved in one corner.

33:30.320 --> 33:37.120
It also felt like there wasn't as much like the games were tightly packed in.

33:37.120 --> 33:41.120
There wasn't as much space to move around the games as there is in other round ones

33:41.120 --> 33:41.760
that I've been to.

33:41.760 --> 33:45.440
That was the other weird thing for me is I was like, dang, this place is like packed

33:45.440 --> 33:46.880
in tight here.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.360
But I mean, I guess like, can you fault an arcade for wanting to maximize the real estate

33:53.360 --> 33:54.080
that they have?

33:54.080 --> 33:55.200
I don't think I can.

33:56.800 --> 34:01.440
But yeah, and when you kind of look at like what music games they have side by side with

34:01.440 --> 34:03.760
any other round one, it's pretty comparable.

34:03.760 --> 34:07.600
I mean, yeah, I noticed Dance Rush was missing, but they had two of those other ones.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.000
Was that a Hatsune Miku dance game or something?

34:10.000 --> 34:10.640
I don't know.

34:10.640 --> 34:13.120
Dance Around is what it's called.

34:13.120 --> 34:13.920
I don't know.

34:13.920 --> 34:14.720
It looks stupid.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.360
Oh, yeah, they did have the Hatsune Miku.

34:17.360 --> 34:21.200
I don't know that one was either, but that almost looked like sort of like Para Para,

34:21.200 --> 34:21.680
but not.

34:22.240 --> 34:22.720
I don't know.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.960
I just looked over and I swear I saw Hatsune Miku in it.

34:25.680 --> 34:31.440
Yeah, so they have like two of those two, but they had two of the dance arounds, which

34:31.440 --> 34:37.760
looks like like an evolution of dance evolution that they put out the one that's like sort

34:37.760 --> 34:47.200
of kind of, you know, actually what it reminds me of now that I think of it, it's a little

34:47.200 --> 34:54.080
bit like just dance almost like they have it where you have to strike a certain pose

34:54.640 --> 34:55.600
that's what it looks like.

34:56.160 --> 35:01.520
Yeah, it looks like it's like a just dance or I don't remember a dance evolution too

35:01.520 --> 35:01.760
much.

35:01.760 --> 35:06.000
So I don't remember if it was like that because I remember that game was like similar to Para

35:06.000 --> 35:08.080
and they had like Para songs in it.

35:08.080 --> 35:11.680
But no, I had no interest in playing dance around.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.120
And there's two of them.

35:13.120 --> 35:13.760
I liked that.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.520
What was that circle cross or something?

35:17.520 --> 35:20.640
The cross circle, the giant circle.

35:20.640 --> 35:26.960
It looked like it looked like it was a sequel to cross beats because you tap on the screen

35:26.960 --> 35:28.880
and you spin this circle with the giant button.

35:28.880 --> 35:29.760
Yeah, Chrono circle.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.080
That's it.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.200
Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.320
That one looked really cool.

35:32.320 --> 35:35.120
I didn't have a chance, but it was actually really crowded when we went.

35:35.120 --> 35:38.480
So the arcades doing well for what it's worth.

35:38.480 --> 35:43.440
So as Joe and Hunter Matt says, did you play any of the claw games for some sweet plushes?

35:43.440 --> 35:46.560
Round ones are the only place where I've been able to win claw games, mostly because they

35:46.560 --> 35:48.000
give hints on how to win.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.600
That is my husband's department.

35:49.600 --> 35:54.720
I very rarely touch those things, but my husband, my husband will play the claw games online.

35:55.680 --> 35:59.600
Like suddenly we'll like a big stuffed animal will show up at the door and I'm like, were

35:59.600 --> 36:01.520
you playing those fucking claw games online again?

36:01.520 --> 36:03.440
No, they just said this to me by accident.

36:03.440 --> 36:06.480
No, I won a prize.

36:06.480 --> 36:14.560
I do have to admit round one crane games are fairly easy, but nothing beats the cheap claw

36:14.560 --> 36:22.240
game in the Walmart and Lodi where I had to get a lot of plastic bag to carry home my

36:22.240 --> 36:22.880
plushies.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.760
Yeah, I was going to say there was a lot of people with plushies when I went through that

36:25.760 --> 36:26.240
one time.

36:26.240 --> 36:31.840
They had a lot of people playing the crane games, which I'm surprised because I always

36:31.840 --> 36:33.440
thought those are kind of a rip off.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.920
I had to replace my amusement pass, though, which made me sad.

36:35.920 --> 36:40.160
But I realized I lost my other one in the move, but and I'm not sure like I have mine,

36:40.160 --> 36:42.480
but I couldn't get to work because it was asking me for a pin.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.240
And then I used the pin that I normally use.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.600
And I was like, it didn't work.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.440
So I'm like, Oh, weird.

36:47.440 --> 36:48.400
I was able to register mine.

36:48.400 --> 36:48.640
Okay.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.160
But I did it on the 2DX machines.

36:50.160 --> 36:50.960
I don't know.

36:50.960 --> 36:56.560
And they translated some of 2DX to English, but not all of it, which is weird.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.360
Like you'll see these screens in English and you'll see some in Japanese.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.440
And I'm like, it's kind of typical, though.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.880
Then they did that.

37:02.880 --> 37:03.680
Sounds like DDR.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.240
I just I've never seen it would be meaning a 2DX.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.680
That's the thing that was weird to me.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.560
So anyway, enough local arcade chat.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.400
But it was it was the thing that I went and did.

37:14.400 --> 37:18.080
I wasn't there very long, all things considered, because then it was like, let's go to the

37:18.080 --> 37:18.960
cheesecake factory.

37:18.960 --> 37:19.600
So we did.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.840
But I was around one for a little bit.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.440
And it was it was the I'd go again, but I'll probably go during the week when there's likely

37:25.440 --> 37:26.560
to be less people there.

37:26.560 --> 37:27.680
It was just very crowded.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.880
School is starting up.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.080
So I'm excited.

37:30.080 --> 37:30.640
I'm excited.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.400
Go home and do your schoolwork, kiddos.

37:32.400 --> 37:32.640
All right.

37:33.920 --> 37:38.960
Like allegedly, I mean, I don't know, because there's conflicting times on their website

37:38.960 --> 37:39.920
and on the door.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.240
The door says they're open till 2 a.m. every day.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.960
The website says they're open till midnight every day.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.360
Yeah, I thought they were open until midnight.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.400
And you have to go into the parking lot entrance, not the mall entrance.

37:51.040 --> 37:51.920
Yeah, of course.

37:51.920 --> 37:52.960
I mean, that makes sense.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.160
So anyway.

37:54.160 --> 37:54.660
All right.

37:55.280 --> 37:56.640
That's it for our gaming weeks.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.320
Let's get into some other news.

37:58.320 --> 38:02.240
Oh, first, housekeeping, because I haven't plugged this in a little bit here on this

38:02.240 --> 38:07.920
show, and I'm not even sure my co-hosts will remember, but we're not going to be here in

38:07.920 --> 38:12.400
one, two, three weeks, Labor Day weekend, as is customary for me the last 10 years,

38:13.040 --> 38:14.160
Dragon Con weekend.

38:14.160 --> 38:19.280
So I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con if you're in the area and you're down for conventions.

38:19.280 --> 38:23.440
I understand everybody's got their own tolerance levels right now, and that's completely cool.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.080
So I don't want to like say, be there or you suck.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.120
Nope, I understand.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.400
You got to do what's best for you.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.560
But if you are going to be at Dragon Con in the area, come say hi.

38:33.280 --> 38:37.760
I'm not talking about my panel schedule yet because things change right up until the last

38:37.760 --> 38:38.000
minute.

38:38.000 --> 38:38.720
They always do.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.240
The app should be released this next week, I think.

38:42.240 --> 38:44.800
And once it's released, I'll talk about my panels.

38:44.800 --> 38:48.880
All I'm going to say this early, as usual, I have panels on digital media.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.800
I'm always thankful that that track has me.

38:50.800 --> 38:51.120
Thank you.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.280
Thank you to Charles and everybody on the digital media crew.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.080
We've got some fun panels on that this year.

38:57.360 --> 39:01.040
Bobby submitted a new idea for VOG to lead.

39:01.040 --> 39:08.000
And y'all are going to, when you hear who they put on that panel, you're going to be

39:08.000 --> 39:08.960
like, what?

39:09.840 --> 39:11.600
So we'll talk about that in a couple of weeks.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.520
And I have some stuff on the gaming track.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.160
Tentatively, I have a ballroom panel.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.920
So I'll again be teasing that next week.

39:21.920 --> 39:25.200
But that's if it's a ballroom, that means they're expecting a big crowd.

39:25.200 --> 39:25.920
So there's that.

39:26.880 --> 39:31.680
And then there's a third track, a mystery track that not literally the mystery track,

39:31.680 --> 39:32.960
but I will reveal it next week.

39:32.960 --> 39:36.720
And all I'm going to say is, if you had told me three years ago I would be working with

39:36.720 --> 39:38.400
this track, I would have said, what?

39:39.600 --> 39:42.560
But I'm very, very, very happy and excited about it.

39:42.560 --> 39:43.840
So yeah.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.200
Bobby says we both have ballroom panels this year.

39:47.200 --> 39:50.800
If I'm not mistaken, Bobby, we have the exact same panel on different days.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.880
Again, it's a panel where they're expecting to fill the room twice.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.200
So I'm going to leave it at that.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.880
It's exciting.

40:00.720 --> 40:04.560
Jaskren in chat says, and Bobby will have the more full one.

40:06.000 --> 40:06.720
Absolutely.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.960
Because mine is on Monday.

40:08.960 --> 40:11.680
And for most people, Dragon Con is over on Monday.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.760
So but Bobby's will be more full.

40:13.760 --> 40:14.480
But you know what?

40:14.480 --> 40:19.440
I'm glad Bobby gets to have his moment because I had that huge Overwatch panel a couple of

40:19.440 --> 40:20.240
years ago.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.520
So this is going to be great for Bobby.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.240
I'm really excited.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.360
And I'm excited to do it too.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.480
I'm just excited to have this opportunity.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.560
So that's going to be in a few weeks.

40:28.560 --> 40:33.280
So we will not be here the night of the fourth because I'll be at Dragon Con.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.560
I imagine if DarkSakura is around, she'll be doing some streaming.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.840
Loki will be working on the Minecraft vids and stuff.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.040
So good stuff.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.560
They've been talking about doing more streaming.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.760
There's other people that I play with.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.520
They stream a lot more than I do.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.920
But I do want to get back into it.

40:49.920 --> 40:51.920
I just have to find something to do.

40:51.920 --> 40:56.560
It's probably gonna be just like, we're going down into a mine and doing all that stuff.

40:56.560 --> 40:57.120
Maybe.

40:57.120 --> 40:57.440
Maybe.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.440
People still watch it.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.480
We're talking about streamlines.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.600
Yeah, because yeah, seriously.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.200
Loki just played Dead by Daylight.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.480
It's worked for the rest of us.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.760
No, no.

41:07.920 --> 41:08.240
All right.

41:08.880 --> 41:12.480
Pod Culture says was going to try and do a one day visit to Dragon Con, but they aren't

41:12.480 --> 41:14.320
selling single day passes online.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.560
I think they were and they sold out fast.

41:16.560 --> 41:19.440
They are not selling single day passes on site.

41:19.440 --> 41:21.920
That is a change they made due to COVID.

41:21.920 --> 41:25.360
Like, you know, they're trying to scale back the attendance a little bit.

41:25.360 --> 41:28.480
And that's one way they're doing it is they're no longer selling badges at the door.

41:29.200 --> 41:33.280
So that was a change they made to try to thin out the convention a little bit, which quite

41:33.280 --> 41:39.600
frankly, versus like last year, it was weird because we were right in the midst of the

41:39.600 --> 41:41.120
Delta wave and all that stuff.

41:41.120 --> 41:44.320
But masks were required as they're required this year.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.560
I was directly in front of somebody who had COVID.

41:46.560 --> 41:49.280
I didn't get COVID at the con because everybody was masked up.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.480
It was fabulous.

41:50.480 --> 41:58.240
So but I loved last year that the convention was like only half full and it was beautiful

41:58.240 --> 42:02.080
to be able to walk around and go wherever you needed to go without bumping into people.

42:02.080 --> 42:02.800
So yeah.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.680
Oh, Pod Culture says I get why.

42:05.680 --> 42:09.040
Just by the time I found out I could swing it a day, it was too late.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.240
I'm sorry, Pod Culture.

42:10.240 --> 42:10.560
Sorry.

42:11.360 --> 42:12.240
All right.

42:12.240 --> 42:12.640
Anyhow.

42:12.720 --> 42:17.440
Um, so let's get into some more gaming news and talk about what's going on.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.680
We'll start with Loki.

42:19.680 --> 42:20.800
What's in the news this week?

42:21.520 --> 42:27.520
So, um, well, Activision wants, or I should say Activision Blizzard wants to let you know

42:27.520 --> 42:28.560
that there's good news.

42:28.560 --> 42:31.520
They have gotten rid of loot boxes in Overwatch 2.

42:32.160 --> 42:35.840
And you know, when they're always giving you good news like that, that it's not really

42:35.840 --> 42:40.400
good news, because if it was good news, they wouldn't be happy about it.

42:41.280 --> 42:48.880
So in this case, they're replacing the loot boxes that were in the game forever with the

42:48.880 --> 42:50.480
battle pass system that they have now.

42:51.200 --> 42:56.400
My thought is because one, they're probably making more money off of the battle pass system,

42:56.400 --> 42:58.160
which is why they're doing it in the first place.

42:58.160 --> 43:02.400
And also because they can put out a press release like this and say, look, we're not,

43:02.400 --> 43:06.000
you know, we're not making it by loot boxes.

43:06.000 --> 43:14.640
So, um, but loot boxes themselves though, will be done with, uh, very soon, actually

43:14.640 --> 43:18.400
in October, which I think is when, uh, Overwatch 2 is coming out.

43:19.280 --> 43:25.600
Um, and then they said that, uh, loot boxes that players are sitting on will automatically

43:25.600 --> 43:27.760
open before the launch of Overwatch 2.

43:27.760 --> 43:28.720
Cause, Oh yeah, that's right.

43:28.720 --> 43:33.360
Cause didn't they have loot boxes, but like the keys cost money is what it was.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.920
No, you, you would get some loot boxes.

43:35.920 --> 43:39.440
Like every time you level up, you'd get a loot box or an event loot box or something

43:39.440 --> 43:40.240
like that.

43:40.240 --> 43:44.800
Um, and then, um, you could also buy and get a lot of cosmetics that way, which people

43:44.800 --> 43:48.080
would like to do during the holiday events, because it was the only way to get some of

43:48.080 --> 43:49.840
the legendary skins or in loot boxes.

43:49.840 --> 43:53.200
But of course we all know the controversy behind loot boxes.

43:53.200 --> 43:56.640
So Blizzard's kind of walking away from that a little bit because they see a different

43:56.640 --> 43:57.760
way to make money on this game.

43:57.760 --> 44:02.400
And I think in general, people just kind of seem to like the battle pass stuff better

44:02.400 --> 44:03.520
than the loot boxes.

44:03.520 --> 44:08.640
This is, that's exactly what Dead by Daylight has in it is the battle pass system and it

44:08.640 --> 44:09.360
works.

44:09.360 --> 44:13.120
So I'm, I'm sure it's going to work fine for Overwatch as well, to be honest.

44:14.560 --> 44:15.120
Probably.

44:15.120 --> 44:15.680
Yeah.

44:15.680 --> 44:16.080
Yeah.

44:16.080 --> 44:19.440
So, um, now some folks in chat are saying there's still loot boxes.

44:19.440 --> 44:20.400
You just can't buy it.

44:20.400 --> 44:27.200
Does that mean you still get like a free like thing every time you level up or do like,

44:27.200 --> 44:30.080
if you're queuing is something in need, sometimes you get a loot box.

44:30.080 --> 44:32.160
I don't remember all the different ways you get it.

44:32.160 --> 44:36.960
But, um, is that still all going to be available or are they sunsetting that as well in favor

44:36.960 --> 44:42.880
of like a premium currency or something like, cause that would exactly be dead by daylight

44:42.880 --> 44:43.360
in that case.

44:44.400 --> 44:49.440
No, they just basically said that loot boxes will no longer be available for sale at the

44:49.440 --> 44:54.240
after the end of anniversary remix three event on August 30th.

44:54.240 --> 45:00.400
And then, um, you, it says, uh, earn and purchase anniversary loot boxes through the event.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.800
So they're still doing stuff that you can earn.

45:03.520 --> 45:06.480
Um, I guess it's just going to be for purchase.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.760
It looks like, okay.

45:08.480 --> 45:12.480
Since it says there will not be available for sale, but I'm sure that if they're giving

45:12.480 --> 45:16.160
them away for free, nobody is necessarily complaining about that.

45:16.720 --> 45:22.000
Um, that they'll probably still be doing something similar for that, but like you just can't

45:22.000 --> 45:22.720
purchase them.

45:22.720 --> 45:22.960
Yeah.

45:22.960 --> 45:27.600
I see them as just walking away from this controversy at the time when their company

45:27.600 --> 45:30.080
is surrounded in controversy anyway.

45:30.160 --> 45:36.480
And going to something that the industry seems to have accepted a little more, um, for, for

45:36.480 --> 45:36.880
what it is.

45:36.880 --> 45:40.240
And I know I keep referencing dead by daylight, but that's just cause it's the game, you know,

45:40.240 --> 45:44.640
both our soccer and I are all in on that and we play it a lot, but certainly there are

45:44.640 --> 45:46.640
plenty of other games to do battle passes.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.880
Like Fortnite is a huge example too.

45:48.880 --> 45:53.280
Uh, what the call of duty even has their own battle, but like it's a very, very common

45:53.280 --> 45:55.840
system in games now, dead by daylight.

45:55.840 --> 45:56.960
Doesn't do a battle pass.

45:58.160 --> 45:59.040
What would you call it?

46:00.080 --> 46:05.440
You just buy the episodes or the DLC, but you don't have to have them to play or to

46:05.440 --> 46:09.040
play against those killers or with those other survivors.

46:09.840 --> 46:14.320
It's more of a pay to unlock, not necessarily like a battle pass system.

46:14.320 --> 46:21.120
Well, if you don't, if you don't buy the pass, you can still play the game.

46:21.120 --> 46:24.080
You just don't have access to some of the content.

46:24.080 --> 46:29.520
That's like, well, like I'm thinking of like the rift pass or whatever is all cosmetics.

46:29.520 --> 46:30.560
That's all it is cosmetics.

46:30.560 --> 46:34.400
They don't like put killers or anything in there, but like in Overwatch, that's what

46:34.400 --> 46:34.960
they're doing too.

46:34.960 --> 46:37.440
They're not going to lock any characters in the battle pass or anything.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.120
It's all just cosmetics.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.960
I just, I don't think of it as a battle pass.

46:43.760 --> 46:44.260
Yeah.

46:44.880 --> 46:50.160
Mike Defton Chat says you need to be playing a whole lot and you get three weekly boxes

46:50.160 --> 46:51.520
for winning nine matches.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.720
That is a lot of matches.

46:52.720 --> 46:55.280
It doesn't sound like a lot, but it is, especially when you have to win them.

46:55.520 --> 46:58.560
All right.

46:59.440 --> 47:02.880
I mean, I'll probably try the new Overwatch when it comes out.

47:02.880 --> 47:03.520
I don't know.

47:03.520 --> 47:07.360
Like it's just one of those add it to the backlog of things I got to play.

47:07.360 --> 47:07.860
We'll see.

47:08.720 --> 47:10.960
So, all right, moving on.

47:10.960 --> 47:15.440
Let's talk about some of the news that THQ Nordic put out this week.

47:15.440 --> 47:19.520
So they had their own little showcase that was online and some of the things that they

47:19.520 --> 47:21.520
talked about were Alone in the Dark.

47:21.600 --> 47:25.840
They're going to be doing a reimagining of Alone in the Dark from 1992.

47:26.560 --> 47:30.080
We don't know a whole lot about it, but apparently it does bring over concepts

47:30.080 --> 47:31.760
and characters from the original trilogy.

47:31.760 --> 47:32.720
They look good.

47:32.720 --> 47:33.220
Yeah.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.960
But I'm not sure.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.240
I don't think it's supposed to be a remake.

47:36.240 --> 47:39.440
I think it's more like a relaunch or a retelling or reboot.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.400
It's like a remake.

47:40.400 --> 47:45.280
How Resident Evil 7 is sort of like a remake of the Resident Evil series type of thing.

47:45.280 --> 47:45.840
Gotcha.

47:45.840 --> 47:48.480
It's kind of like a whole different take on it.

47:48.480 --> 47:49.040
Let's put it this way.

47:49.040 --> 47:53.840
It looks better than the last remake of Alone in the Dark.

47:53.840 --> 47:56.160
Now, if you want to just have a straight up remake,

47:56.160 --> 47:59.200
then you've got Destroy All Humans 2 re-probed.

47:59.200 --> 48:04.400
They are just remaking that for PS5, the series consoles for Xbox and PC.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.280
So that is happening.

48:06.640 --> 48:10.720
Space for Sale is a game that they're going to be putting out where you, you know,

48:10.720 --> 48:14.640
I love my space games and you do get to explore planets, build properties

48:14.640 --> 48:17.760
and ensure the inhabitants of the planets are satisfied.

48:17.760 --> 48:20.880
So it also uses procedurally generated landscape,

48:20.880 --> 48:23.120
like another space game I really enjoy.

48:23.120 --> 48:27.600
But I don't think it's quite as in-depth on that front as maybe No Man's Sky.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.440
But it does look like a cute little space game.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.120
It'd be cool.

48:31.120 --> 48:35.200
Speaking of remakes, Gothic, the original 90s RPG,

48:35.200 --> 48:37.680
the original Gothic game is getting a remake.

48:37.680 --> 48:38.480
That's kind of cool.

48:39.200 --> 48:42.160
So that's coming out for PS5 series and PC.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.760
Jagged Alliance 3 is on its way.

48:45.760 --> 48:48.960
In this strategy game, you get to operate mercenaries

48:48.960 --> 48:51.920
and you get tactical strategy shown in the trailer.

48:51.920 --> 48:55.200
This is the first Jagged Alliance game in 14 years.

48:55.200 --> 48:55.840
Just heads up.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.440
The Valiant was another game that they showed during this.

49:00.160 --> 49:02.560
Again, it's an RTS type of game.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.800
So there's a co-op mode in this game as well.

49:04.800 --> 49:07.280
And a second player can drop in and out, which is kind of neat.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.400
Tempest Rising was another game.

49:10.400 --> 49:14.160
3D Realms is a part of this, and it's a military based RTS game.

49:14.720 --> 49:16.640
It's a post a nuclear war game.

49:16.640 --> 49:18.640
And you pick from one of three factions.

49:18.640 --> 49:21.040
You gather resources, et cetera, et cetera.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.600
Don't get me excited by saying Tempest.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.040
Yeah, sorry.

49:25.040 --> 49:25.840
Not that Tempest.

49:25.840 --> 49:26.340
Different one.

49:27.200 --> 49:28.320
Knights of Honor 2.

49:29.840 --> 49:32.720
It's a game like Age of Empires or Civilization,

49:32.720 --> 49:34.880
but you're doing your own medieval kingdom.

49:34.880 --> 49:38.960
You appoint marshals and clerics and you ally with other nations

49:38.960 --> 49:41.280
and kill those that aren't cooperating with you.

49:42.240 --> 49:45.120
Outcast 2, a new beginning.

49:45.120 --> 49:49.120
This is a sequel to the PC game from the 90s, Outcast.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.800
Yes, all these decades later.

49:50.800 --> 49:52.320
Outcast 2, a new beginning.

49:52.880 --> 49:56.080
Slated for PS5, Xbox series, and PC.

49:57.120 --> 50:02.480
A game called Recreation, spelled W-R-E-C-K, Recreation.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.080
It's an open world racer.

50:04.080 --> 50:08.000
I'm assuming maybe going for a little bit of that burnout vibe,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.640
but it has the Loki factor.

50:10.640 --> 50:14.560
Meaning players can build their own tracks and share them with users.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.840
And speaking of the burnout connection,

50:17.840 --> 50:22.480
Fiona Sperry and Alex Ward, who created Burnout, are behind this game.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.160
So it's Burnout with a track editor.

50:24.160 --> 50:26.720
So this is the Loki game.

50:27.280 --> 50:28.560
Who's the other one that they just...

50:29.280 --> 50:32.000
The other Burnout type game that was...

50:33.440 --> 50:36.720
It was just like all the Crash Mode stuff, but it was its own game.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.280
I don't remember, but it was okay.

50:39.280 --> 50:40.240
Yeah, digital release.

50:41.200 --> 50:43.760
I don't remember what it's called, but I didn't play it.

50:43.760 --> 50:46.080
But yeah, I'll check it out.

50:47.360 --> 50:49.680
Way of the Hunter, a hunting sim.

50:49.680 --> 50:54.320
So if you've ever actually played Deer Hunter in a Walmart arcade,

50:54.320 --> 50:56.320
this is probably a game up your alley.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.040
If you haven't, then probably not.

50:57.040 --> 51:01.920
Did you see the Big Buck Hunter that they had at round one with the Terminator stuff in there?

51:01.920 --> 51:03.280
No, I didn't see that.

51:03.280 --> 51:04.160
It's so messed up.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.520
I'm like, Terminator?

51:05.520 --> 51:06.020
What?

51:06.020 --> 51:15.700
No, I saw the gigantic dot matrix looking puzzle bobble game, though.

51:15.700 --> 51:17.140
Oh, yeah, that looks awesome.

51:17.140 --> 51:18.020
I want to play that.

51:18.020 --> 51:21.620
I watched Shane and his husband play that, and it looked silly.

51:21.620 --> 51:25.220
And then there was a giant Kinect 4 game, and I was like, this is also silly.

51:25.780 --> 51:29.140
So yeah, lots of silly ticket munchers in that game.

51:29.940 --> 51:31.220
Anyway, let's see.

51:31.220 --> 51:32.180
What else do we have?

51:32.180 --> 51:33.940
Oh, hey, wrestling fans.

51:34.820 --> 51:36.020
We have something for you.

51:36.020 --> 51:38.020
AEW Fight Forever.

51:38.740 --> 51:42.100
It's a wrestling game, and it's going to be shown at Gamescom 2022.

51:42.900 --> 51:44.660
Another game called Stuntfest.

51:45.460 --> 51:48.820
If you like to eject from cars, Stuntfest is for you.

51:49.620 --> 51:53.860
The driver gets to be launched in the air and bounced off obstacles before going back

51:53.860 --> 51:54.740
in their vehicles.

51:55.300 --> 51:57.940
All right, a closed beta starting this weekend.

51:58.580 --> 52:03.620
And it sounds like that almost sounds like burnout a little bit.

52:03.620 --> 52:07.620
SpongeBob SquarePants, the Cosmic Shake is also coming out.

52:08.580 --> 52:13.220
It's coming out for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so it's lagging behind a generation,

52:13.220 --> 52:14.980
but it is a SpongeBob SquarePants game.

52:15.860 --> 52:20.420
And then at the very, very end, they teased a South Park game, but that's all we know.

52:21.380 --> 52:25.860
But I would assume it's not a role playing game because that's Ubisoft's area.

52:25.860 --> 52:27.780
So I don't care.

52:27.780 --> 52:28.580
It'll be awesome.

52:29.220 --> 52:35.860
So I could see why they'll do the SpongeBob stuff for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

52:36.820 --> 52:38.660
It's the sibling consoles now.

52:38.660 --> 52:43.940
Yeah, or you handed it down to your children's bedroom consoles.

52:43.940 --> 52:44.500
Exactly.

52:44.500 --> 52:45.000
Yeah.

52:47.540 --> 52:51.860
Plus the newer stuff, even though we make fun of Sony for backwards compatibility,

52:51.860 --> 52:55.780
sometimes the reality is PlayStation 5 will play all the PS4 games.

52:55.780 --> 52:59.140
So it's not like you can't say SpongeBob isn't available on PS5.

52:59.140 --> 53:01.460
It is in backwards compatibility mode.

53:01.460 --> 53:02.260
So there's that.

53:02.820 --> 53:07.460
So Tiger Claw says, Where would they take the third South Park game?

53:07.460 --> 53:09.540
The first one was LARPing in a fantasy world.

53:09.540 --> 53:10.900
The second one was superheroes.

53:10.900 --> 53:12.580
Wouldn't this be a different genre?

53:12.580 --> 53:14.820
Because Ubisoft made those other games.

53:14.820 --> 53:15.860
Not Nordic, right?

53:16.500 --> 53:21.140
Or did THG bring in another sequel to South Park 64?

53:21.140 --> 53:23.140
The best South Park game ever made.

53:23.140 --> 53:24.900
How about a first person shooter game?

53:25.380 --> 53:29.700
That's what I'm thinking, because I wasn't that legit a THQ game.

53:29.700 --> 53:31.860
South Park 64, I feel like it was.

53:31.860 --> 53:32.580
It may have been.

53:35.780 --> 53:37.220
That game was awful, but I loved it.

53:37.220 --> 53:37.860
I played it.

53:37.860 --> 53:39.220
I rented it from Blockbuster.

53:39.780 --> 53:41.540
Yeah, I'd totally play that again.

53:41.540 --> 53:42.040
All right.

53:43.540 --> 53:48.660
Let's move on to a somewhat innovative new way to test some of these games potentially,

53:48.660 --> 53:49.540
right, Dark Sakura?

53:53.780 --> 53:54.280
You're muted.

53:54.900 --> 54:01.300
It's also some good news for Stadia.

54:03.300 --> 54:08.180
So Stadia has a...

54:09.780 --> 54:16.580
They're testing a type of game trial under its click-to-play system, about a 50-50 one.

54:17.460 --> 54:22.980
What they're doing is for two games, which is Control and Sniper Elite 4,

54:23.780 --> 54:31.220
50% get a normal timer on the demo, and the other ones get unlimited access

54:31.220 --> 54:33.380
until they unlock certain achievements.

54:34.420 --> 54:38.340
So you could play and never hit those achievements,

54:38.340 --> 54:40.580
unless it's like, you finished stage one.

54:41.140 --> 54:42.100
Here, yay.

54:42.100 --> 54:43.140
Have an achievement.

54:43.140 --> 54:43.780
Oh, you're done.

54:44.980 --> 54:49.460
But at any rate, they're doing these on a 50-50 split to examine

54:49.460 --> 54:53.380
what effects it has on the trial length metric.

54:54.180 --> 55:01.380
So is it going to grant a person more time on the trial?

55:01.380 --> 55:05.620
Is it going to let the person experience more of the game and lead to a purchase?

55:06.260 --> 55:09.140
So those are different things that they're going to look at.

55:09.140 --> 55:11.780
So as an example, for Sniper Elite 4,

55:11.780 --> 55:15.540
you try the game until you complete the beginning of the end achievement,

55:15.540 --> 55:18.340
which comes at the end of the first mission, sort of like I was saying before.

55:20.020 --> 55:24.260
Which if you don't get the first mission done, I guess in 90 minutes,

55:24.260 --> 55:26.820
then this lets you finish the first mission.

55:29.700 --> 55:36.740
So this means that players who can't finish the first level in that time period,

55:38.340 --> 55:44.820
they will be able to keep trying until they do and have a more complete experience with it.

55:45.540 --> 55:54.340
And as one of the Stadia reps said,

55:54.340 --> 55:58.020
is that they want new players to experience the observe, plan,

55:58.020 --> 56:01.540
execute mantra that sits behind the game, as they're saying.

56:02.420 --> 56:06.660
So you can run and gun, but the best results come from considering your options

56:06.660 --> 56:08.340
and planning your attack accordingly.

56:08.340 --> 56:12.900
So they want people to be able to take their time and play it as if they own the game.

56:13.860 --> 56:17.380
And I think that it's a really, really good idea.

56:18.260 --> 56:22.340
It also allows for better feedback, I think, of the game.

56:24.340 --> 56:28.660
So if someone plays through that first level just really fast,

56:28.660 --> 56:33.540
trying to get it done or get to the next level within that time frame,

56:33.540 --> 56:37.060
they're not really getting the full experience of the game, is what they're thinking.

56:37.620 --> 56:41.460
So by being able to sit back and do the whole first level

56:42.100 --> 56:47.380
and chill with it, that's kind of what our old demos used to be like.

56:47.380 --> 56:52.420
For example, we'd get those PlayStation demo disks, and it'd be like,

56:52.420 --> 56:54.900
oh, here's the whole first level of Jumping Flash,

56:54.900 --> 56:57.220
or here's the whole first level of Jammer Lamy.

56:59.060 --> 57:03.060
You get a better chance to enjoy the game and play around with it a little bit.

57:03.700 --> 57:08.100
And as far as some other...

57:09.620 --> 57:13.220
They want to do some other types of experiments for different genre.

57:13.940 --> 57:17.220
So one of them, as an example, would be

57:17.220 --> 57:21.700
imagine trying an RPG and starting at level 100 instead of level 1,

57:22.420 --> 57:27.380
or a turn-based strategy when you've got the full kingdom

57:27.380 --> 57:29.620
instead of just a village at your disposal.

57:29.700 --> 57:34.020
So seeing what the full advanced version of the game could be,

57:35.140 --> 57:37.940
and that it might be worth owning to work up to it.

57:40.660 --> 57:46.660
Now, there's a few other things going on with Stadia,

57:48.660 --> 57:54.580
but right now they've been doing some more business with developers,

57:54.580 --> 57:57.060
like giving them a cut of the Stadia Pro revenue.

57:57.860 --> 58:01.140
And issuing out new developer tools.

58:02.420 --> 58:08.740
So they are, I think, finding a bit more of a stride.

58:11.940 --> 58:15.540
And I think that we're starting to see a lot more benefit for it.

58:15.540 --> 58:18.660
I can also tell you that, with the exception of last night,

58:18.660 --> 58:22.660
I have had a much smoother gaming experience on Stadia

58:22.660 --> 58:25.940
than I have on even some home platforms.

58:26.660 --> 58:30.500
Like, typically, when I'm playing Dead by Daylight,

58:30.500 --> 58:31.860
I don't get lag.

58:31.860 --> 58:33.940
Now, last night I had lag spikes,

58:33.940 --> 58:37.620
but also the people I was playing with on Xbox and PC

58:37.620 --> 58:39.540
were getting lag spikes, so I think it was their server.

58:41.060 --> 58:44.580
So it's hard to do a skill check when you have a lag spike.

58:46.340 --> 58:51.940
But overall, I think that Stadia has really made some very good improvements,

58:51.940 --> 58:54.020
including just their user interface.

58:56.100 --> 58:59.140
Like, being able to search for the things that you want to buy.

58:59.140 --> 59:01.540
And I'm paid for Stadia Pro.

59:01.540 --> 59:02.660
I'm fully down for it.

59:05.220 --> 59:16.020
And then I found that the games that they're putting out for the Pro group

59:16.820 --> 59:19.060
are actually some pretty fun games.

59:19.060 --> 59:22.980
I've got some, and I own some big titles on there

59:22.980 --> 59:24.660
that I just flat out paid for,

59:24.660 --> 59:26.260
because I don't have any other way to play it.

59:28.340 --> 59:30.740
I'm trying to see some of the ones I have.

59:30.740 --> 59:32.420
I've got Cyberpunk.

59:32.980 --> 59:34.820
I have the new Avengers game.

59:38.020 --> 59:42.500
It's just really good.

59:42.500 --> 59:43.780
Of course, I have Dead by Daylight.

59:43.780 --> 59:47.380
But I mean, there's also some of those free games that...

59:48.180 --> 59:52.100
Well, and I say free because I've got the...

59:54.660 --> 59:56.740
Stadia Pro.

59:57.780 --> 59:59.220
And there are...

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.140
There's just some stuff I wouldn't have tried before

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.220
that I've actually gotten a chance to try.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:10.180
Like, I've got a copy of Child of Light.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.420
I never got to play it.

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:15.460
I have control of Cthulhu Saves Christmas.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.580
Doom 64 is on there.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:23.780
Okay, so yeah, I know there's plenty of games available on Stadia.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.620
It's interesting that they're kind of...

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.700
Like you put it, they're finding their stride.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.180
And I think even in the very beginning,

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.580
there were a lot of people that were very interested in,

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:37.300
what can Stadia do for demos, especially?

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:41.860
Because you don't have to download some gigantic 80 gigabyte...

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.820
How big was that Final Fantasy Strangers in Paradise demo?

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.420
It was something like 80 gigabytes.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.460
But something like Stadia, you could just jump right in.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.380
And so it's interesting to see them sort of...

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.180
You know, I don't want to say course correcting,

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:57.940
but almost like making adjustments and sort of thinking about

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:01.220
how can that element of the trial game or whatever

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.820
be even stronger and building it based off the achievement?

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.260
Because I mean, that makes a lot of sense

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.060
is that you want people to take their time through that level

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.060
and not just rush through the first level

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.580
because they're against a timer.

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.780
Or say a two hour clock on Steam refunds

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.060
or whatever the case may be.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.420
So it's also a very interesting flip in the industry.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.900
And the reason why I say that is because I think about

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.980
back in the Xbox 360 arcade,

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.020
when all releases had to have a demo with it.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:30.100
And there were quite a few releases where

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.660
when you got to the end of the first level,

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:33.860
which was the trial,

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.620
the thing would pop up and tell you,

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.380
you just earned an achievement.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.060
If this was a full game,

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.140
we'd unlock the achievement on your profile,

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:43.220
press A to go to the store to buy this game

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.980
and unlock the achievement right now.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.300
It's just, it's interesting that, you know,

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.620
when I think of achievement-based demos,

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.700
I think way back to that.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.740
But it's interesting how Stadia

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.180
is kind of rewriting this a little bit.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.420
You know, and-

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.500
And I was also gonna add in,

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.740
I mean, they had really good demos.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.780
Like they had the Resident Evil Village demo up

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.260
and made it really easy to check out things that were,

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:18.100
you know, new without,

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.940
especially for me not having a PC,

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:22.660
it gave me a really solid chance to give it a go.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.380
I think it's just a matter of time

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.380
before you search for a game

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.700
and it comes right up with try a demo now.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.740
Now I know to some extent,

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.100
Google kind of already does that

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.460
in like written results and stuff.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.100
But I mean, like,

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.540
there was a thing just lately on Google,

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.940
I think you search for cats or something

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:43.300
and this whole interactive thing with the cat paws happens.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.900
You can click and they do that whole thing.

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:46.660
Like it's really just a matter of time

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:49.460
before you search for Resident Evil 7.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:52.020
And sure, the search results come up really tiny on the left,

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.940
but then a big old box pops up on the right

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.500
and there's the demo ready for you to play.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.300
And I'm gonna put something on cam,

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:01.460
I hope that people watching at least can see it.

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:05.700
All of this stuff on there is stuff I've claimed for free.

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.860
Oh yeah, because of the,

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.980
yeah, it's akin to a PlayStation Plus

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:12.420
or an Xbox Gold at this point,

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.380
you know, that stuff accumulates.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.900
Or my Epic Games account.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.940
Oh yeah, that too.

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:20.820
But I mean, the thing is, is that if I had

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.500
my Stadia controller with me,

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:29.700
I could take my iPad and play on my iPad if I wanted to.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.180
I can play the full Dead by Daylight on my iPad.

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:37.460
So, you know, I think, I honestly think that,

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.540
oh, it stands for the third remastered is on here.

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.660
I'm getting it right now.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.180
I mean, that's just sort of like how it goes.

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.340
Like I'll see new stuff pop in all the time

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.060
and I'll be like, oh heck, I haven't seen this.

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.620
Or I didn't even know it was on the platform

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:55.700
and it ends up being pretty, pretty fun.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.380
You know, I find lots of neat stuff.

01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:00.020
I've discovered like that Murder by Numbers game

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.140
that Bobby's fond of.

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.980
I've got it now.

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:07.780
You know, it's really been,

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:12.980
I have zero regrets about paying for this service.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:17.060
And I wish that, I honestly think that this is the way

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.940
things are going to be going is all cloud-based.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.540
I think once 5G is more accessible

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:26.340
and you can really take your iPad anywhere,

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.580
literally anywhere and play over 5G.

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.180
I think that's when cloud gaming really starts to like,

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.860
just, you know, go hog, you know?

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.740
Cause right now you still have to get a wifi somewhere.

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:42.260
But I think as over air internet becomes more and more,

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.420
at least in the big cities, you know,

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.860
more and more available.

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:49.620
I absolutely think that type of portable cloud gaming.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.540
And that's why I think the way Microsoft

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.180
is aligning themselves is very intelligent as well,

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.260
because you know, the Game Pass stuff,

01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:00.020
a vast majority of, I can't say all of it for, you know,

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.060
licensing or whatever it is,

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.620
but a vast majority of it is also just, you know,

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.620
you log in and there you go.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.540
So it's just, it's interesting.

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:12.180
VO by Kurt in chat, also a Stadia fan saying,

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.460
I had to let my Stadia lapse,

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.220
but I loved it when I had it.

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.500
And Bobby Black Wolf reaffirming love for murder by numbers.

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:20.180
All right.

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.220
Meanwhile, let's go to the record before I forget.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:23.540
Yeah.

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:26.260
I did find another unicorn in Dead by Daylight

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.700
and that game we're on Stadia.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:28.980
Really?

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.340
I did.

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.140
Who was our killer in our match.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.180
Oh, how interesting.

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:37.380
I think it was someone who was new to the killer.

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.420
We kind of noticed it.

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:40.980
So we're like, Hey, here's, here's some stuff.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.020
I know you haven't played them before.

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.740
And I was just saying, and I was like, yeah.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.780
I'm uh, and I noticed he had numbers in his name.

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:48.820
I was like, are you on Stadia?

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.700
He's like, yeah, I am.

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.420
And I'm like, well, so am I on a Mac is like,

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.900
I'm on a MacBook pro and I'm like, I'm on a Mac mini.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:01.540
So, so it was another unicorn and I've seen other people on Stadia

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.940
who were not on a Mac.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.220
And then I ran into another one of my people.

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:08.500
Interesting.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:09.620
All right.

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:10.820
All right.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.180
We're going to go to our next story.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.100
Uh, I'm taking a quick restroom break.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:14.500
Sorry.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.500
So, um, stretch it out if you have to.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.140
I'll be right back.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:18.580
Don't drown.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.220
I'll try.

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.020
Okay.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:22.340
All right.

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:31.300
So, um, we talked a little bit about aim junkies and their lawsuit with, um, bungee

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:38.340
right now because of the fact that will aim junkies makes a cheat tools for destiny too.

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:49.140
And so there right now, the situation is that the initial lawsuit, um, the judge actually

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.380
basically dismissed it.

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:59.380
Um, aim that, you know, according to bungees own license agreement that they have to go

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:06.660
through arbitration in order for that to, um, actually, you know, continue on.

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:11.780
And so, um, because of that, you know, they have that chant bungee has to refile the lawsuit,

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.300
which they did earlier this year.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:21.940
Um, but now of course, um, aim junkies is making claims, or I should say, just, you

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:29.700
know, jabbing them a bit with saying that their, uh, claims of grievous harm are, uh,

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:37.460
full of it, that apparently their con their council believes that, um, you know, more

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:42.340
of the speculative, um, stuff that they're kind of thrown out there, they're just trying

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:45.940
like different angles that basically come after this company.

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:55.060
What the, the argument that aim junkies is trying to make is that basically the months

01:07:55.140 --> 01:08:04.100
where this tool is being used in destiny two were some of the highest months in the game's

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:09.300
history with bungee bungees trying to make the claim, of course, that it caused grievous

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:15.940
harm, and, you know, impacted their sales, or impacted the revenue that they would be

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:19.860
making on destiny two.

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:24.420
So it's going to be interesting to see, um, aim junkies is actually subpoenaed valve,

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:28.660
PayPal, and bungee to gather some evidence to disprove their claims.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:34.500
And they're going to try to basically say that, no, it didn't really affect the game at all.

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:41.380
Like, I get what they're trying to say, but the same time, like, I don't think I can side with

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:45.380
a cheat, a cheat software developer for an online game.

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:49.700
You know, it's, it's an interesting thing.

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:55.780
It's a, it's an interesting approach to, you know, try to poke the bear, if you will, basically

01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:03.940
just putting out press releases against destiny two instead of, you know, I don't know, hoping

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:08.020
that you get to look at your ass suit in court, which is probably going to end up happening.

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:08.820
I'm with you.

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:11.700
It's, it's fascinating that this is happening.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.780
I mean, I hope they lose, but it's fascinating that this is even happening in the first place.

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.180
You know what I mean?

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:20.580
And I mean, the cheat makers, you know, like profiting off this whole, you know, creating

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.180
misery in an online game and so forth.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:22.580
I'm sorry.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.780
I don't have sympathy for the cheat makers in this particular case.

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:26.420
Exactly.

01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:28.340
But it's fascinating what they're doing.

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:33.700
And of course, bungee is going to come in and say it caused harm because,

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.860
Because their lawyers are going to be better.

01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.700
That that's how you file a lawsuit.

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:42.420
You have to prove that if they go, well, we're mad at you and we're going to file a lawsuit,

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.820
but it really didn't affect us at all.

01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.580
You can't win a lawsuit like that.

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:48.820
You obviously have to prove that it caused harm.

01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:50.500
And I'm sure that they could do that.

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:55.300
It could be speculative because it could be a higher month, but they could say that, you

01:09:55.300 --> 01:10:01.460
know, because of this many cheaters out there, it caused, you know, players not to spend as much.

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:06.500
I don't know, but like they have it's going to be hard to argue against.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:14.260
Bungee, but look, yeah, I'm just thinking that bungees lawyers are probably going to be well

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:17.620
better paid than the lawyers for this aim junkies.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:22.420
And honestly, based off of the history of, you know, them taking on other cheat makers,

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.860
I don't think you have a shot.

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:26.740
No, I think it's lost cause to Mike Defton.

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.420
Chat says no sympathy for cheaters.

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.940
Yeah, pretty much that part.

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:32.260
Vo by Kurt says, well, they also have to protect their content.

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:37.140
Oh yeah, as far, I mean, I'm sure the bungee lawyers are at the top of their game on this,

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:42.740
but it's just, it's interesting to me that the destiny to cheat makers just didn't try

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:47.860
to like settle in a, we will disappear and never be heard from again kind of way.

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:52.340
But instead they're, they're trying to go out burning their bridges spectacularly,

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:57.620
which may result in financial penalties against them in a civil case.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.740
And that's just kind of surprising to me that they, they want to go that hard.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.340
Well, and they don't even have to necessarily prove, I think, damages.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:09.220
They can, they can prove that they violated copyright and they could just, you know,

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:10.980
take that route.

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:11.780
I don't know.

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:12.660
I think they're gonna lose.

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.900
I know they're going to lose.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.380
I don't.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.140
I mean, yeah, that's a given, but yeah.

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:20.980
But it's fascinating that they're trying.

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:25.140
I mean, you have to look at them like you kind of want to go, yeah, you love to see

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:28.580
somebody fighting the big, bad companies, but then not like this.

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:29.860
Yeah, not like this.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:32.180
It's like, no, I'm not going to root for the cheater.

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:35.380
And Bungie is actually, Bungie's okay.

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.620
Like I, like, especially compared to a lot of their peers right now.

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.020
What would be the precedent that would be set by this?

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:42.740
Like if they won't, you know, it's like, oh, okay, cool.

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:45.380
We're just going to have cheat programs all over the place.

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.180
Hey, all that online content you like playing stuff.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.020
Well, it's just going to be ruined by everybody.

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:50.980
So, Hey, cool.

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:51.620
Yeah.

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:55.060
You're just looking at the destiny to cheat makers going, wow, they're doing that.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.700
They're, they're, they're really doing that.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.100
They're, they're arguing to be like, well, you know what?

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:03.940
You just have to cheat even harder, you know, it's back and forth.

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:06.420
All right.

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.300
Moving on.

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:11.060
Let's talk about something that Jason was making fun of in the intro tonight.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.300
It's the announcement of an announcement.

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:13.780
That's right.

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:19.940
There is a Sunsoft digital event that is set for August 18th where the company will be

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.860
talking about upcoming titles for 2022 and 2023.

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.660
And it'll be on YouTube and a press release.

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:31.540
Yuichi Ochi said, although we've been quiet for some times, many things have been happening

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:32.820
behind the scenes.

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:38.580
We are very excited to be able to finally share our vision for the rebirth of Sunsoft

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.340
with fans old and new.

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.340
So interesting.

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:47.380
Now it might be worth looking into what they say in the press release.

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.820
What Sunsoft is all about.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:53.620
They were established in 1971 as a part of Sun corporation.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:58.260
And in 1978, they began to make video games and arcades with block challenger and block

01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:58.820
perfect.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:05.860
In the early 1980s, some of their early hits were Arabian, Icky, and Kangaroo.

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:12.740
On July 25th, they released the first NES Famicom title in Japan under Sunsoft brands

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.180
called Super Arabian.

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:20.260
And Sunsoft, of course, probably best known for their retro development, including Gimmick,

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:27.620
Blaster Master, Spy Hunter, Batman, Trip World, Euphoria the Saga, and much more.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:31.780
That much more, including Fester's Quest, which I didn't see named in that press release.

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:33.780
I guess we're not getting a new one of those.

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:34.900
That's unfortunate.

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:42.660
So going in chat, Digirama S says, OMG Sunsoft, Journey to Silius 2, please.

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.660
Anything's possible, right?

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:47.300
Mike Deff says, how about a new Kangaroo game?

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.340
Give me that, please.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:53.220
Hey, retro archives are all the rage right now.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:58.820
Why not a repackaging of some of those arcade hits in some type of arcade package?

01:13:58.820 --> 01:13:59.460
Who knows?

01:13:59.460 --> 01:13:59.940
Who knows?

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:00.500
You know what?

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:00.980
Hmm.

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:01.540
You know what?

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:07.460
So like, you know, they started their company with some great arcade games, block challenger

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.900
and block perfect.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.420
Now it's time to take a look at that.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:13.140
Loki has been dismissed from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:18.260
I'm very sorry to say, please look forward to our next episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.900
where we will be replacing Loki with a ferret.

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:21.460
Thank you.

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:21.960
Good night.

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.220
I hope it's something good.

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:27.060
I mean, like, they're the games that they've made.

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.740
Like, Batman was great.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.140
Like, all their NES games are great.

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:34.100
So I'd be curious to see what they're going to do.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:35.700
Hopefully, they're going to be able to do that.

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.140
I mean, they're going to be able to do that.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:40.020
So I'd be curious to see what they're going to do.

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:43.060
Hopefully not sequels to, like, really old games, because, like, I don't know.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:44.820
I want to see new stuff.

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:52.980
Ashima Panic in our chat says that's what I thought to myself, too, as far as the blockchain

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:53.540
stuff goes, too.

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:54.820
And I pray it won't be.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:55.220
You know what?

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:58.740
It's a very cynical but very realistic approach to that whole thing.

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:01.540
Ashima Panic also says Fester's Quest is the surprise.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:02.660
I wish, I wish.

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:07.780
But as some folks in chat are saying, you know, those types of licenses, they don't

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.140
really have those licenses.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:13.300
Now, as Joe and Hannah-Matt says, down for another Blaster Master game, honestly.

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:20.340
Don't forget, we've had very recently those Blaster Master reboot games that were really

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:20.740
good.

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.740
Inti Creates did them.

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:26.180
Blaster Master, was it Zero Mission?

01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.620
I can't, no, that's Metroid.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:31.700
I don't, there was a Blaster Master, but they did a whole trilogy.

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:36.580
And two and three had nothing to do with, like, they were just kind of like original

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.180
games that were done in the same vein as that first game.

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.020
Blaster Master Zero, that was it.

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:45.700
But that first game was actually a beautiful reboot.

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:46.980
Like, I loved it.

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:52.340
It was way better than the one that was done on the Wii, which unfortunately I think was

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.780
a Sunsoft endorsed thing.

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:59.540
But yeah, that one that Inti Creates, I believe, put together is great.

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:03.940
I just don't think there's room for Sunsoft to do anything else on top of that, quite

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:04.660
honestly.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:10.100
I'm trying to think of, like, because, you know, I think Sunsoft's done a lot of shooters

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:16.260
in Japan, so that's probably something that, you know, they may be doing as well as rebooting

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:16.820
some of those.

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.900
They might not be as well known over here.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.820
But I'm looking at some of the list of video games that they've developed in the past.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:29.460
Interestingly enough, yeah, they're credited for Fantasy Zone, actually, but they did the

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.260
NES port.

01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:31.780
But see, again, that's not their game.

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.580
That's Sega's game.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.820
So they can't just say, oh, we're going to make a new one of those.

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:37.540
Well, the NES port was questionable at that.

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.300
Yeah, let's see.

01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:44.820
They actually were the ones that did the Final Fantasy Legend games, but they were rereleases

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:48.100
and kind of like, you know, they were, you know, translated.

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.780
But some folks in chat pointed this out.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:57.380
Some of their most recent releases were Clock Tower games.

01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:03.300
So they did Clock Tower the First Fear, Clock Tower 2, and Clock Tower Ghost Head were some

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:08.260
of the last things that they did in 2012 before a really big break.

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:11.860
So I wonder if maybe a Clock Tower reboot isn't something.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:17.300
That is one that I think that's probably the most likely thing is a Clock Tower reboot.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.180
But we'll see.

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.780
I think that could be kind of cool.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.140
Clock Tower characters for Dead by Daylight.

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:24.580
Who knows?

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:26.420
Oh, my God.

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.740
If they put that scissor guy in Dead by Daylight, I'm quitting.

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:31.700
I can't handle it.

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.460
I cannot handle Scissorman.

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:34.660
And I can't handle it.

01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:35.220
I'll quit.

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:35.620
I will.

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.140
Too scary.

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:40.740
All right.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:44.420
Anyway, thank you to everybody, by the way, in chat.

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:49.460
Literally three different clips of Loki getting fired here tonight on the show for a blockchain

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:49.780
joke.

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:50.180
Love it.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:53.940
Thank you all.

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:54.260
All right.

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:57.540
That's true.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:01.780
Orange right in chat says, guessing Rob isn't going for Team Scissors after all, I guess.

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:02.980
You make a good point.

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:04.340
I have to switch to Team Paper.

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.100
All right.

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:07.860
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:11.940
And Dark Sakura bringing back the classics.

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:12.340
Why not?

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:14.260
Let's bring back another horror classic tonight.

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:15.700
What we do.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:21.140
So eight years ago, PT was delisted.

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:26.260
And the person who had to do the delisting has actually spoken out.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:35.780
It was also the same person, though, who worked to have it listed.

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:46.260
So the former Konami staffer named Pearl actually had a few things to say about it on Twitter.

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:53.300
And Kojima actually acknowledged the eight-year anniversary after these statements came out.

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.100
So it was pretty cool.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:59.620
But at any rate, some of the posts went along these lines.

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:05.300
A fun fact, since I was the lead at the time at Konami, I helped get this product set up

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:08.340
on the storefronts, fake publisher, and everything.

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:13.780
And I was the one who had to call Sony and ask them to take it down and block redownloads.

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:15.620
That was a super fun conversation.

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:23.460
And then, as for people who are asking, you know, why her response was,

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.860
I say this with love because Konami.

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:28.660
How many times have we said this?

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.700
You know, what's interesting?

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.220
I know this individual.

01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:35.940
I don't know.

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:40.740
I think maybe we met once a while ago, but we definitely have mutual friends in common,

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:44.100
because if you think about where friends of ours used to work, they were friends.

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.940
Where friends of ours used to work many years ago, she also worked there.

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:51.540
I feel bad for her that she's becoming a main character because of this story.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.820
And I know she's locked her Twitter down since then.

01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:57.780
And honestly, I don't think she's did anything wrong here.

01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:59.620
You know, this is, again, it's eight years ago.

01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:04.580
She's not the one that pushed, I mean, okay, maybe she figuratively pushed the button,

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:06.100
but it wasn't her call.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.540
She's just, that was her job.

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:12.180
She was the liaison between Konami and Sony and had to have these tough conversations

01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.020
because of what someone else wanted to do.

01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:17.860
So I actually feel bad for her that now, because she's kind of looking back and having

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:23.060
a laugh at this all this time later, that now she's like, this story has just caught

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:28.020
wildfire and she's had to lock down her Twitter because she's, you know, a completely

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:31.700
normal person with an interesting job in her past.

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:36.020
And it's just, I feel bad that everybody's scrutinizing this and all this stuff.

01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:37.460
Yeah, going to chat.

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.260
Mike Defton chat says, yeah, she was following orders.

01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:41.140
I can't blame her.

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:46.260
SSJ100Matt says our own Flaco Jones had the world record speed run for PT for a little

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:46.980
bit though.

01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.300
Mike Deft says I can blame Konami though.

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.180
Fuck Konami.

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:51.860
Yes, you can blame Konami in this.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:55.620
And I feel bad because I wonder if Konami didn't send a nasty gram over.

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:56.180
I mean, I don't know.

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.460
I'm making shit up.

01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:01.060
Maybe she was just getting tagged at a lot of tweets and she went, you know, on lockdown

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:02.180
for that reason.

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:08.260
But I can't help but wonder if Konami didn't say something, which would be ridiculous.

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.620
The entire world knows.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.380
But it would be totally in character.

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:13.380
That's what I'm worried about.

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:15.140
There's more that I had to say though.

01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:15.780
Okay, please.

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:17.160
Okay.

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:24.500
Just to go back though to the comments on it, because that's really, you know, the first

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:29.940
and foremost thing about it is that she went on to say that it was a really awkward situation

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:34.660
and that they had to go through all of these hoops to get it set up.

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:39.060
Lots of operational exceptions, she said.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:44.180
And then to send the request in to block it, more engineering workarounds, I'm quoting

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:44.660
now.

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:49.540
It was exciting to see people hype about it and see the work pay off, but in a way also

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:50.040
not.

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:56.020
And the other comment made, believe me, I wish it had gone different too.

01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:00.580
It was definitely really funny to be plotting the secret cool thing for the fans.

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:06.100
It was amazing to see everyone come together to try to figure out the experience and see

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:08.100
them come away with so much love for it.

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.900
I'm super grateful I got to be a part of that in some small way.

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:16.740
So I don't see any flippancy about anything in her comments.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:22.020
She was like, I was really proud of this and then it was really awful to have to take it

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:22.520
down.

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:27.780
I think it's very matter of fact and very transparent.

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.140
It's an element of transparency.

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.860
We never get out of Konami.

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:36.900
And that is why, unfortunately, she has found herself now everywhere this week is that she's

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:38.420
giving us an element of transparency.

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.700
We never get out of Konami.

01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:43.620
So and technically we're not getting it out of Konami.

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:44.180
That's right.

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.180
You know, she's somewhere else now.

01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:46.820
Yeah.

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:52.260
So it's waiting for NDAs and whatnot to have worn off before she could say something about

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:52.760
it.

01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:58.260
I just also my other advice, not that, you know, Pearl should give a hoot what I think,

01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:05.700
but my other advice would be clearly you could put this in a book and sell it, like put

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:06.820
it in a book and sell it.

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:08.340
Don't give it away for free on Twitter.

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:12.100
I doubt that this is going to be enough material to fill a book.

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.980
Oh, I bet.

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:19.460
But from the inner workings of Konami, I bet there is plenty to fill a book.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.300
This is just one chapter, my friend.

01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:26.580
I can tell you that only really a handful of people would buy that book.

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:28.100
I'm serious.

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.740
But look, look at where this story is.

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.220
I mean, it's catching a lot of places this week.

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:41.140
I think there's a lot of people, I think, that are interested in what the fuck happened

01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:41.860
to Konami.

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:43.140
Like what?

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:47.060
Because we still don't really have an answer to that question.

01:23:47.060 --> 01:24:00.180
I can also tell you that there are absolutely full videos online in terms of like 30 minutes

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.220
to over an hour.

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:02.500
True.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.980
Going through a lot of that already for free.

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:10.580
I think the things that would have been said, hers is just like the last, the last nail.

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:15.540
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I know Kojima would never write it because he's a classy

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:18.980
guy, but I would read his book about the final years with Konami.

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:24.900
Well, Kojima should get his BFF to write the book because his BFF writes plenty of books

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:27.220
about the last days of game development projects.

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:28.580
So just food for thought.

01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:31.540
And of course, I'm talking about Jeff Keighley, so food for thought.

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:36.500
But I do understand these are niche things for sure, but interesting.

01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:44.260
At the same time, though, there was a really good video I watched maybe about a couple

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:48.420
years ago that really went in depth.

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:54.340
Some of it was very speculatory, but it had plenty of evidence to back it up about exactly

01:24:54.340 --> 01:25:01.300
what might have gone down and the prelude to Kojima's leaving.

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:04.340
It went a lot into history and I thought it was really good.

01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:07.940
If I can find it again, I will absolutely share it with everybody.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:13.700
Well, it's interesting that one person that does not hold back in discussing Konami is

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:19.300
Guillermo del Toro, who in a tweet simply wrote about this whole thing, simply wrote

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:23.780
F K and to stand for fuck Konami.

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:28.980
He does not make his stance on Konami very secret.

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:31.860
So anyway, all right.

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:37.060
I think I also I can applaud Guillermo del Toro for taking a sentiment and just shortening

01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.740
it to two simple letters.

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:39.780
Two simple letters.

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.100
All right.

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.540
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.700
We have some more stories.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:50.180
Two simple companies slinging words back and forth.

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:50.740
Right, Loki?

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.500
Yes, it's like it's just never ends.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:26:00.580
So we talked about last week, I think, where Sony had made the argument that, you know,

01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:04.980
Call of Duty was this big franchise and they're trying to block the whole merger with Activision

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.100
and stuff like that.

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:11.380
Well, now Microsoft is accusing Sony of blocking games from being added to Games Pass.

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:20.180
They're saying that apparently I think this may even go back to the whole Call of Duty

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:27.540
stuff as well, but apparently Microsoft has been trying to convince the different agencies

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:29.620
that they can't shouldn't be acquiring them.

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:34.820
Microsoft's ability to continue expanding Games Pass has been hampered by the Sony's

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.500
desire to inhibit such growth.

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:43.140
Sony pays for blocking rights to prevent developers from adding content to Games Pass and other

01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.820
competing services, they claim.

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:52.340
And then to throw a little bit more shade on Sony, Microsoft, you know, I guess Sony

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.420
was arguing that their their service is not doing as well.

01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:02.100
And so Microsoft made a basically I don't know if it's like a PowerPoint.

01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:03.700
I want to imagine it's a PowerPoint.

01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:05.620
It's Microsoft.

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:10.100
They're not going to do it in whatever the competitors are.

01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:14.820
Some document, of course, that they said, well, here's how you can make your PlayStation

01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:15.540
plus better.

01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.980
They provided their information to them.

01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:24.180
So, yeah, it's I don't know.

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:28.660
Yeah, they have a 27 page document that they provided, so.

01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:31.860
Interesting, all the shade.

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:37.380
Yeah, and also interesting how this whole Microsoft merger thing is playing out in these

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:40.100
different documents and so forth and the arguments that are being made.

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:46.740
I think my favorite was the one about like Microsoft saying that like Activision Blizzard

01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:49.700
is that they aren't making anything that's like a must have.

01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:53.540
They aren't making anything that good, which is wild to me that they would say that about

01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:54.900
a company they're buying.

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:59.860
But like I also get from a completely legal, legal, strategical perspective, they have

01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:00.340
to say that.

01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.660
And what's what's one thing?

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:07.140
At least I know I've always said about Blizzard and, you know, in the past, before all this

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:11.460
drama, llama stuff in the past few years and Bobby Kotick's mismanagement, all this stuff.

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:18.260
One thing that Blizzard has always historically done incredibly well is taking a genre of

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:24.340
game and making it more accessible to a wider audience like Overwatch and Team Fortress

01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:33.700
2, like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone, like EverQuest and World of Warcraft, etc.,

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:34.580
etc.

01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:39.700
Blizzard is very good at this, and that's how they've made their bucks over the years.

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:43.380
And so it's interesting to me that like, you know, Microsoft's whole stance, you know,

01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:47.620
is, well, they're not making you know, they're just making games in the same genre or what

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.780
it's just it's so wild to me.

01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:52.580
But but legally, it's the smart play.

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.160
Yeah.

01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:54.200
Yeah.

01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:58.980
Anyway, why don't they just say that, like, you know, Bobby Kotick's kind of driven the

01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:01.060
country or driven to the country?

01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:05.940
Well, in some ways, yes, but the company into the ground and it's not worth as much because

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:06.740
of his sorry ass.

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:09.460
But I guess legally, there might be some issues with that.

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:10.680
Oh, well.

01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:16.180
Anyway, let's move on to one more story before we take a trip down memory lane in the classic

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:16.900
game of the week.

01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:24.260
And I wish this was not a story that I feel like we're reporting on way too frequently,

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:28.740
but I feel like this this whole issue just even escalated this week.

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.500
Made me sick.

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:32.020
Yeah, it really made me sick.

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:32.820
It's gross.

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:39.380
But, you know, we if if we don't say things about it and express that change needs to

01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:41.700
happen, change needs to happen.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:48.980
Um, so Clara Sorrente, who goes by keffles online, I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:49.620
I'm very sorry.

01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:54.260
I admit I did not know this individual until I read this report, but I don't follow a lot

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.820
of the large popular streamers.

01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:58.100
That's not me being edgy.

01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.540
That's just me being honest.

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:05.780
So anyway, Clara Sorrente is a trans streamer and a political commentator and was arrested

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:07.380
by Canadian police.

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.060
And I want to make sure that's clear.

01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:14.420
This is now a problem that's not unique to the US because there's already been going

01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:15.220
on, though.

01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:15.780
Oh, yeah, no.

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.100
And I'm not trying to say, oh, it doesn't happen in the US.

01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:20.100
I'm just saying this is a large problem.

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:29.140
She was arrested by Canadian police after a swatting incident, and she put out a YouTube

01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:33.620
video where she recounted what happened, saying that the police locked her out of her accounts

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:37.700
because she's still a suspect in this investigation of a made up fucking crime.

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.420
Like, wild.

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:40.920
Anything.

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:42.980
It's not just her.

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:44.980
It's her fiance's computer, too.

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:46.260
All his stuff.

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:53.300
Anyway, she uses her platform for Activision, like calling awareness to a California bill

01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:56.340
that would protect trans youth that are fleeing the state.

01:30:56.340 --> 01:31:02.180
And gosh, I wonder why someone would want to target her, which makes me sick to say.

01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:04.660
But it's the quiet part out loud.

01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:05.620
And it's sad.

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:07.860
And it's sad that it worked.

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.460
It's really sad that it worked.

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:16.820
The morning of Friday, August 5th, she was woken up by London police services that went

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:18.340
into her home with an assault rifle.

01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:25.300
Somebody impersonating her emailed every city councilor in London, Ontario, saying that

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:30.340
she had committed murder, had a firearm and planned to go to City Hall and shoot every

01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:31.380
cisgender person.

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:35.540
And it was signed under her dead name.

01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:37.700
Yeah, and that's another.

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.860
What trans person dead names themselves?

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:44.420
Like, there are so many red flags here.

01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.860
It's just, it's, yeah.

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:53.000
Anyway.

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:55.780
I donated to the GoFundMe for the record.

01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:56.660
Oh, there's a GoFundMe?

01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:57.220
I didn't know that.

01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:02.100
Yeah, it's actually linked on your article.

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:06.020
Oh, yes, it sure is.

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:10.980
So if you actually search for her name, Clara Sorrente, or you can search for the Twitch

01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:15.220
name, Kefles, it's a moving legal fund that's available on GoFundMe.

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:22.100
Also, it's pointed out that the Kefles is not the only streamer that is still having

01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.460
these types of problems.

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:29.140
A Grand Theft Auto 5 streamer named Aiden Ross, another internet personality named

01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:31.860
iShowSpeed also had SWAT issues.

01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:36.020
A Hearthstone streamer had the cops invade her home on a live stream in February.

01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:41.460
Where's the fucking end of this?

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:48.820
Like, this is still ongoing, not just nationwide, but worldwide.

01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:51.780
And this continues to be a problem.

01:32:51.780 --> 01:33:00.660
And I really like the part that just is that the basic fact finding education on behalf

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:05.780
of the London, Ontario police and these huge red flags we already pointed out about the

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:10.820
dead naming and some of the ludicrous things that were said and of the level of the seriousness

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:17.700
that they were taking is just like, this should be 101 type of stuff on how to spot a fake.

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:22.340
And I understand that you have to take everything seriously.

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:25.300
But you don't have to go to this extent.

01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:29.060
I hope she sues and I hope she wins.

01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:31.380
I don't know to what extent she can do that in Canada.

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:34.980
I'm not familiar enough with the laws and so forth, you know, and I understand it's

01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:39.140
not as civil lawsuit friendly of a culture as it is here.

01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:42.100
But I hope she sues and I hope she wins.

01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:44.900
Maybe the money will do the talking.

01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:55.460
This is why I'm a big fan of, like, don't use your, your, your birth date in your passwords,

01:33:55.460 --> 01:34:02.260
don't, you know, don't do those little memes online, where, oh, put in your full initials

01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:04.660
and do this or put in your date of birth and do this.

01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:07.060
Now, thankfully, all of my passwords are in another language.

01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:16.420
Um, but, uh, you know, it's telling people exactly where you live, you know, that's why

01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:21.700
my last name is nowhere out there on the internet, unless it's like for something official.

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:22.200
Yeah.

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:27.780
You know, it's, you got to take steps to, to, I mean, it sucks.

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:30.900
You do have to take steps to protect yourself.

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:37.220
You know, you can, like, if you're on your social media or doing posts there, do it through

01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:38.580
a VPN, for example.

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:48.420
You know, um, remember when I got like that series of harassing, uh, messages and I tracked

01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:52.020
down their VPN, listed the address and said exactly who it was.

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:55.860
It was what's his face, his friend back in the day.

01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.020
Oh, the one, the one that stalked me?

01:34:58.420 --> 01:34:59.380
No, no, no, no.

01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:02.420
It was, um, what was his name?

01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:09.060
Oh, oh, I don't even want to dig, I don't want to dignify it with the name, but yeah,

01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:09.620
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:10.500
One of his friends.

01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:11.000
Yeah.

01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:17.300
And I basically was like, um, I just found your address in Granite Bay.

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:18.740
Do you want me to post it publicly?

01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:22.340
Like, oh no, no, no, no.

01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:23.060
I apologize.

01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:24.740
It wasn't, uh, I'm like, whatever.

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:27.220
But it is that easy.

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:35.300
I mean, granted, it was maybe easier 10 years ago, but it's still fairly easy.

01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:40.180
I mean, so like for the biggest ways that you can protect yourself, even though you

01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:46.260
should not have to is, you know, never give out any of your personal information online.

01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:51.780
Don't use your real name, uh, for your usernames, uh, look into a VPN.

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:52.820
Look into a VPN.

01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:57.460
There is an anti-swatting registry in some states.

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:01.220
Um, so look for that.

01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:09.620
And there's also, um, uh, some other, uh, legal counsel that might be, you know, out

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.580
there in your area.

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:18.180
But, um, but there are, uh, um, some anti-swatting resources out there that you can look into.

01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:23.300
And I would, I would suggest, you know, if you feel so inclined, you might want to consider,

01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:26.500
uh, uh, uh, donation on that GoFundMe.

01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:27.700
They're so close to the goal.

01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:30.980
All right.

01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:37.380
But I mean, we've had people get 20-year prison sentences for, uh, swatting.

01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.380
Yeah, they're not enough.

01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:39.860
Not enough.

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:40.900
Different state.

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:41.140
Yeah.

01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:50.660
You know, so it's, uh, but in a lot of states, it's, if no one dies from it, it's typically

01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:53.300
considered, uh, aggravated harassment.

01:36:54.100 --> 01:37:00.660
Although in California, though, uh, you, uh, if you swat somebody and you're, you're caught,

01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:05.540
then you have to pay for the full cost of the swat or tactical response team.

01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:05.940
Good.

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:07.700
Which is, can be upwards of $10,000.

01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:08.740
Good.

01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:09.300
Good.

01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:13.140
Honestly, if, and if that ever happened to me, I'd file a civil lawsuit so fast, your

01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:13.700
head would spin.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:19.940
And in New York, um, you can be charged with murder if a hoax ends in death.

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:22.100
All right.

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:26.900
So I just wanted to throw that out there because I think people need to know their own resources,

01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:29.780
how to protect themselves as well as yeah.

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:33.620
And it, and it's just one of those things where like, I, I, I take no joy in talking

01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:35.860
about this, but it's important to highlight.

01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:43.060
This is still happening and police departments everywhere, not just the U S everywhere, say

01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:47.700
what you will about the police in the U S this didn't happen in the U S police departments

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:56.420
everywhere needs some basic education, basic education on how to spot this stuff.

01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:57.140
Like it just.

01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:05.060
I, my own point though, with, uh, the London, Ontario police is that they dead named this

01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:13.060
woman continued to, and are doing all this, even though Toronto police, you know, dismissed

01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:15.460
it outright and didn't charge anything.

01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:16.900
And we're, we're good to her.

01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:22.820
I'm also seeing this as trans harassment by a public facility.

01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:23.220
For sure.

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:24.680
Yeah.

01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:30.980
So she's got a suit and there will be people who will back her up.

01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:31.220
Yeah.

01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:33.940
And again, I can't claim to know how Canada courts work.

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:38.980
I barely understand it here, but I, if there's any chance that she can go for civil recourse

01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:44.100
from the police department, she absolutely, absolutely, absolutely ought to do it.

01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:44.820
Absolutely.

01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:47.140
All right.

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.580
Let's go back to a simpler time when you know, you know what a crank, you know what a prank

01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:55.300
was calling someone and hanging up the phone.

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:57.940
That's that was, that was the extent of a prank.

01:38:57.940 --> 01:39:02.900
Let's go back to a simpler time as we take a trip down, go catch it.

01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:18.740
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler California where I'll dive into the vault

01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:21.460
and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:24.100
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:27.700
All right.

01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.340
And dark soccer, what did you pick for us this week?

01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:39.460
I picked Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc because, oh, I just hurt myself a minute ago.

01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:48.340
I, uh, I love Danganronpa and I didn't realize that it was as old as it was until I saw that

01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:50.260
the sequel was 10 years old.

01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:52.980
So I decided to go with the first one.

01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:54.340
I'm surprised I haven't done it.

01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:59.140
And, and, you know, Shane is also a fellow Danganronpa fan.

01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:08.980
Um, so at any rate, uh, Danganronpa is, uh, um, actually no Danganronpa 2 turned 10.

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:14.020
The first Danganronpa is, uh, it came out in 2010.

01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:24.420
So, uh, but anyway, um, it is a visual novel adventure that was published by Spike and

01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:26.580
it is the first in the Danganronpa series.

01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:34.100
Um, it was released in Japan for, uh, the PS portable in, on November, 2010, later ported

01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:43.220
to iOS and Android in August, 2012, localized and published in English, uh, by NIS America

01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.500
for multiple platforms.

01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:53.060
Um, so, uh, at any rate, um, you play a character named Naegi Makoto.

01:40:53.220 --> 01:41:02.340
Um, and, uh, basically you're sort of in this battle royale situation, sort of, kinda, um,

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:08.500
he's considered to be the ultimate lucky student because his name got pulled at random to join

01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:14.500
this school called Hope's Peak Academy, where everybody else is sort of like this ultimate

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:14.980
student.

01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:28.580
Um, and so, uh, he gets, he, he goes into the school and wakes up with no memory of

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:34.180
how he got there or what's happened, just that he's stuck in, in the school with other

01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:38.900
students who also were in the same situation, except for one who does not remember what

01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:39.860
her specialty is.

01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:44.100
Um, and she's also like probably my favorite character.

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:52.020
Uh, but at any rate, um, the game plays out very, very interestingly.

01:41:52.820 --> 01:42:03.620
Um, so you find out that you are locked in the school, uh, by looks by this little half

01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:06.020
black, half white bear named Monokuma.

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:10.420
Um, you know, as in monochrome bear, Kuma means bear.

01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:19.380
Um, so Monokuma in order to cause ultimate despair, and I'm, I'm really trying not to

01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:23.060
spoil it since now we've got people like, uh, Ramus is going to try to give it a play.

01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:31.300
Um, but, uh, for all intents and purposes, it seems like it's Monokuma or whoever's controlling

01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:41.380
Monokuma, um, has having all the students, uh, basically kill somebody and either there's

01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:47.140
one person left or they keep, you know, finding out who did it.

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:56.580
So when, when the character, when the character dies, you have to, um, gather evidence and

01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:02.420
then you have a class trial and you've got like, uh, like truth bullet events.

01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:05.700
I think if I'm right, I think Danganronpa like means truth bullet.

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:07.300
I'll have to look it up again.

01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:10.260
Um, but you also have to argue your case.

01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:15.860
You kind of have some, uh, uh, like ace attorney elements in it.

01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:22.420
Um, very similar to that with the investigation and finding contradictions and, but it's a

01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:24.100
much faster gameplay style.

01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:26.980
And you can have like a rhythm game element in it too.

01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:36.820
Um, but the way that it goes though, is that if, if you figure out who the killer is, then

01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:42.660
you, um, they get executed pretty gruesomely yet stylistically.

01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:50.340
Um, and if you don't get the right person, then all the other students get executed and

01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:51.460
the killer goes free.

01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:59.700
Um, and so as you go through more and more of these, you know, you have your school life

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:04.980
mode where you can go around and talk to people and learn from them until a murder is discovered.

01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:13.220
Um, there's even some kind of, um, like dating sim elements to it as well.

01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:14.740
Like you react to different things.

01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:16.500
You've got your free time segments.

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:22.340
Um, you can also find like, uh, hidden items throughout the game for extra stuff.

01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:25.540
Um, but the big thing is looking for the clues.

01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:30.580
Um, and you've also got your e-handbook, which is also where you can save your game.

01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:38.260
Um, but once you have all of the evidence, so when you found every piece of it, um, I,

01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:41.060
we have an ad playing.

01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:43.860
Oh, sorry.

01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:45.300
Oh, sorry.

01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:52.900
I, yeah, I, I never noticed any of that cause I, I pay for my account.

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.940
Um, but anyway, pay for mine.

01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:57.700
No, thank you.

01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:05.140
Um, but at any rate, um, you know, all of these students are like that, that you have

01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:12.020
are like, like the character on screen, um, uh, Leon is like the, the ultimate baseball

01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:13.380
player.

01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:21.940
Um, uh, uh, I'm trying to think of who others, uh, you know, we have the ultimate computer

01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:29.460
program or the ultimate pop star, you know, the ultimate, uh, mangaka, you know, so, or

01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:35.700
doujinshi artists, I should say, who was also by the way, voiced by, uh, uh, Yamaguchi Kappe,

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:37.300
who was also Ranma, just saying.

01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:41.620
Um, but any rate, uh, cause I never played it in English.

01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:42.740
I only put it in Japanese.

01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:50.340
Um, so, uh, uh, at any rate, um, you know, so you go through the game, you uncover more

01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:58.500
and more of the story and you learn a lot more about what's going on in the game.

01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:05.540
Um, you play as Makoto and the, the girl I was talking to, uh, who was made to forget

01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:12.020
what her specialty is, is, uh, Kirigiri Kyoko, who Kyoko is like, she stayed my favorite

01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:12.420
character.

01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:22.820
Um, um, but, uh, you also, uh, work with her quite a bit and she's got very keen observational

01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.780
skills.

01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:29.060
Um, you also find out quite a bit more about her and her connection to the whole thing.

01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:37.540
Um, but going now back into some of the development, cause the development actually has to do,

01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:42.900
uh, well, some of the evolution of the story has a lot to do with Makoto's voice actor.

01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:47.220
Um, and I'm sure the moment I say the name, a lot of people are going to go, I know that

01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:55.060
name, um, Ogata Megumi, who was, oh, let's see Shinji in Evangelion, uh, Sailor Uranus,

01:46:55.060 --> 01:47:05.620
um, uh, Yukito in Cardcaptor Sakura, um, trying to think of some other ones that people would

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:05.860
know.

01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:13.300
I know, uh, Yugi in Yugio, um, uh, I'm trying to think of some other ones that people would

01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:25.140
know, uh, uh, Yukimura Sanada in, uh, Samurai Deeper Kill, um, also did some voiceover,

01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:28.900
uh, did, uh, uh, Angelina Jolie's character in Hackers.

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:37.140
Um, also, uh, I'm trying to think of something else that is a little bit more recent that

01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:37.860
people would know.

01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:50.420
Uh, oh, uh, was also in Ray Earth, um, in Bleach, uh, Super Robot, uh, Taisen, the animated,

01:47:51.220 --> 01:48:01.940
um, and also in Danganronpa 2, also, uh, played, uh, uh, another, uh, another character,

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:06.660
uh, there as well, who I will get into probably when I do Danganronpa 2.

01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:16.260
Um, but at any rate, uh, the writer, uh, Kodaka Kazutaka, um, wanted to do an original video

01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:22.580
game, um, and that thought his other ideas were too derivative from Action Adventure

01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:30.660
and felt that Action Adventure was becoming unpopular, so he wanted to do a darker narrative

01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:31.700
based around a killing game.

01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:38.340
Um, the original version wasn't very high speed, but that developed on the way, um,

01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:44.740
but Spike Chunsoft, uh, was, uh, thought it was pretty risky because it was kids killing

01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:47.620
each other, you know, in a high school environment.

01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:53.380
They really thought that that might not go over well, but a lot of people really picked

01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:56.420
up the, the style of the game.

01:48:57.060 --> 01:49:04.580
And so, um, they actually had some influence by, uh, by the late, uh, Hyde from, I don't

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:11.140
ever remember if it was Hyde or Hide, but from X Japan who did pink blood to censor

01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:12.580
the blood and add stylishness.

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:24.900
Um, the, uh, the word Danganronpa came from a character designer, um, Komatsuzaki Urui

01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:29.620
and was written in Kanji before it was changed to Kadokana for the logo.

01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:41.300
Um, and it goes around themes of, uh, despair and hope and pulled from, uh, some, uh, influences

01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:43.540
from Saw and Cube.

01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:45.940
Well, you know, that Hypercube is one of my favorite movies.

01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:51.940
And then it uses a special graphics technique that's called 2.5D motion graphics that

01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:55.940
blends 2D character items in a 3D explorable environment.

01:49:55.940 --> 01:50:02.180
So kind of pop art style, like you can see as you like walk into rooms with some of the

01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:05.700
characters, how the items pop up like a pop-up book.

01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:09.540
And then the characters are also, you know, that flat 2D.

01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:17.780
Um, and then, you know, they threw in a lot of, a lot of like surprise things, like, especially

01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:18.820
right from the beginning.

01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:27.380
Um, but what I was going back to for, um, Ogata being, um, Makoto's voice actor is that

01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:36.660
because of the energy and gravitas she put into the voice acting that Makoto was given

01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:45.700
a bigger, uh, a bigger impact on the game made a lot more of just the, you know, personal

01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:52.820
insertion character, but was, uh, made out to be a bigger, more important character.

01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:59.060
And as we've learned now through the franchise, a pretty ongoingly important character.

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:08.660
Um, so at any rate, um, there also were, uh, some traits that were, that had in common

01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:12.820
with Battle Royale, as in the novel by Takami, uh, Koshin.

01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:22.820
Um, and, uh, they did originally also come up with the game with adult protagonists,

01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:27.540
but they thought that high school students were better because of their immaturity and

01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:31.780
would have more character development and that they would react differently than an

01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:33.780
adult would to a killing game.

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:41.620
And that it's showing the balance between despair and, and hope.

01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:52.260
Um, so, uh, Oh, an interesting thing is that when the English dub came out, um, the publisher

01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:56.820
NIS was asked by Spike Chunsoft to keep Monokuma's name in intact.

01:51:57.620 --> 01:52:02.260
And, uh, they also said though that that was their favorite character to localize,

01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:05.060
um, keeping the voice very similar.

01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:07.780
They also, uh, kept the same soundtrack.

01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.220
Of course, the soundtrack is great.

01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:14.580
Um, but some of the other, uh, voice actors that they chose, they had a really hard time,

01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:20.260
especially for, uh, Toko, um, having an alter ego.

01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:22.900
They had to get two voice actors for Toko.

01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:27.460
Um, and then there were, of course, smartphone games that came out after that.

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:28.820
So we're going to go into the legacy.

01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:35.540
Um, Danganronpa, Monokuma no Gakushu, um, which is Monokuma strikes back and then alter ego

01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:38.340
were put out for iOS and Android.

01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:46.740
And, uh, there also was a Danganronpa one, two reload, which was a Vita port of the first

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:49.380
game and its sequel Danganronpa two goodbye despair.

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:54.980
Um, which some people even say that that's superior to the first one, but I won't go

01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:55.620
there.

01:52:55.620 --> 01:53:01.700
Um, I think that Shane likes that one the best because of a particular character who

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.460
has a pet hamster.

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:04.660
Who cares what he thinks.

01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:05.380
I'm just kidding.

01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:12.500
I do because we, when we work together, I actually gave him a key chain of that character.

01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:13.140
Oh, that's cool.

01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:13.940
Yeah.

01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:18.180
Um, I'm killing, I'm killing the B roll because I'm sick of all the ads.

01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:27.380
My, my favorite in the second game though, uh, has a little, um, uh, Galaga ship, uh,

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:33.300
uh, uh, Vic Viper pin pixely Vic Viper pin that she wears in her hair.

01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:43.540
Um, but anyway, um, now the, uh, the game came out, uh, in, uh, in North America, in

01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:45.540
Europe in February, 2014.

01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:50.340
Um, it came out on steam, uh, February, 2016.

01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:57.620
Um, Danganronpa went to reload, uh, came out on PlayStation four in North America and Europe

01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:01.380
in March, 2017 and in Japan on May 18th, 2017.

01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:06.660
There's also a virtual reality demo called cyber Danganronpa VR, the class trial, which

01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:07.940
is on PlayStation VR.

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:15.300
There is an enhanced version called anniversary edition that came out May 21st, 2020.

01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:20.260
Um, else has, you know, it has the gallery mode, uh, like the other ones do.

01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:24.980
Um, and there was also a few other things, um, it's going to be released for switch.

01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:31.300
And then there's the Danganronpa Decadence bundle, um, will also come out separately

01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:37.060
and January 18th, 2022, it was released for Xbox one and windows via the Microsoft store.

01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:39.940
The game sold very well.

01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:42.020
Um, it was a big hit.

01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:48.900
Um, and they're also, um, I didn't mention it, but there is also like a full on action

01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:52.580
game where you play as Makoto's, uh, sister.

01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:57.380
And you have like a gun that has like different effects on people.

01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:00.500
Um, you have to fight like all these Monokuma.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:05.540
Um, and the thing I like about it is that that game, uh, it was, it's called ultra despair

01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:06.040
girls.

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:12.200
That game also played a lot into the closing of the chapter.

01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:13.960
So just go ahead and throw this out.

01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:24.520
There was an anime which retold, um, uh, the, first of all, it had the, the prelude to what

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:27.720
happened in Danganronpa with the characters that were in the second game.

01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:34.120
And then it was called hope and despair where it, you would watch one episode and it was

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:39.240
a prelude and the next episode was like in the future after the despair was already going

01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:40.360
on with a different group.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.200
Um, and there was also a Danganronpa anime just by itself, retelling the first game.

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:54.520
So, uh, there's, there's just so much, um, there's also Danganronpa V3 killing harmony

01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:56.040
that came out in 2017.

01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:00.440
Um, there had two manga, um, adaptations.

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:08.200
There was a light novel, uh, two light novels, um, called Danganronpa if, where, uh, basically

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:12.760
Makoto finds this, uh, fabled escape button early on.

01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:22.280
And then there's one called, uh, uh, I'm trying to see, uh, the, the tragic warriors of despair

01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:29.080
that, uh, is kind of like, they're both kind of alternate universe, uh, stories.

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:30.200
Um, I've read them both.

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:30.920
They're actually really good.

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:43.720
Um, but this, this game is like, it's just all, I really don't know what else I can say

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:48.920
about it because it's just had so much to it.

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:57.080
Um, the game has received, you know, just wonderful ratings all across the board.

01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:02.280
Um, the Vita version has an 80 of 10 on Metacritic PC is 82 of a hundred on Metacritic.

01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.920
Um, it's just, it's all over the place.

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:08.280
It really is.

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:16.440
In fact, last night when I was, uh, uh, looking up, um, the, you know, stuff to do for the

01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:20.280
B roll, I just ended up just started watching through the play through.

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:22.280
I was like, Oh yeah.

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:24.680
And then I realized, Oh my gosh, what time is it?

01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:30.040
Um, but, uh, but yeah, it's absolutely worth it.

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:32.360
And if you don't want to play through the first game, watch the anime.

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:33.080
It's really good.

01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:35.960
I mean, it's really abbreviated.

01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:40.840
There's a lot of stuff that you'll miss from it, but it tells the story really good, really

01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:41.560
well.

01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:47.400
And all of the games are just really, really awesome.

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.080
They're just, they're so in depth.

01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:54.280
I didn't get into V3 as much though, but the first two and ultra despair girls, I was totally

01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:54.600
into.

01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:55.880
All right.

01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:56.280
That's it.

01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:58.040
There's just classic game of the week.

01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:01.720
And I, I also was kind of surprised that this game is even 10 years old.

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:05.560
Um, I, you know, obviously more than that, but, uh, yeah, it's just another one of those.

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:05.800
Wow.

01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:06.920
I feel like it was only yesterday.

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:09.320
I first heard about this game, but yeah, right.

01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:10.280
It is your classic game of the week.

01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:12.680
Don Gunropa playing it pretty religiously.

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:13.180
Yeah.

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:14.120
All right.

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:17.880
Let's travel around the world and quickly check out some other headlines in a segment

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.720
that we call rapid fire news.

01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:21.000
And we'll start with Loki.

01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:27.720
So, you know, getting a hint of all that movie action and movie money that they want.

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:33.240
Um, Bandai Namco is planning for a live action Pac-Man movie.

01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:35.960
Okay.

01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:37.160
Who the fuck asked for that?

01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:38.760
Nobody.

01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:42.680
Nobody asked for that, but you know, Sonic the Hedgehog is doing well and people love

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:44.920
Sonic the Hedgehog as much as they love Pac-Man.

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:45.420
Right.

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:46.300
Right.

01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:47.260
Right.

01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:49.900
Listen, here's the question.

01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:52.060
Pac-Man's already gotten their live action movie.

01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:56.940
It was, um, terrible and it started Adam Sandler and we don't need another live action.

01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:58.300
Yes.

01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:01.100
Here's the, here's the real question I have about this movie.

01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:03.340
Will the love interest be Ms.

01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:07.740
Pac-Man or Pac-Mom or both?

01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:15.580
Will this, uh, uh, Pac-Man movie explore the complicated pack love triangle.

01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:17.420
The Pac-Man suddenly finds himself in.

01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:23.580
He had the Pac-Man story on our Saturday morning cartoons, right?

01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:24.700
I just don't.

01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:28.860
And there was also the cupid cartoon and I watched them both and they were great.

01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:32.460
AJ twist and chat points out the smash multiverse movies grow.

01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:43.420
Yeah, but like, I just don't think that this will just, yeah, I just, I don't see that

01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:45.660
unless maybe they make a full on.

01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.620
Oh, it's so eighties like comedy out of it.

01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:49.100
I don't know.

01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:50.940
It has to be right.

01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:53.660
Aside from just like saying, you know, it's going to be terrible.

01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:57.500
So this was reported, um, wayfarer studios.

01:59:57.500 --> 01:59:59.580
They're teamed up with light beam entertainment.

02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:05.100
Um, and they're going to make the live action movie based on it.

02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:06.540
And that's, that's all we know so far.

02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:07.680
Um.

02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:16.700
It'll be based on a new original story from Chuck Williams.

02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:25.020
And, um, he was the producer of, or one of the producers on the hedgehog.

02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:29.340
Did you say it was light beam entertainment or light year entertainment?

02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:33.740
It was light beam entertainment.

02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:34.300
Interesting.

02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:37.100
Cause I couldn't even find them on like Wiki or anything like that.

02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:38.620
So they must be a huge studio.

02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:40.300
Yeah.

02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:41.100
So huge.

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:49.340
Um, yeah, I, I will Chuck, I think that's Chuck Williams company.

02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:55.500
So, um, it says a original idea from Chuck Williams who did, it was a producer of Sonic

02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:57.980
the hedgehog of light beam entertainment.

02:00:57.980 --> 02:01:00.380
So it's probably his production company is what it is.

02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:00.860
Oh, okay.

02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:01.500
Bad idea.

02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:05.180
Um, but can they not?

02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:08.860
I don't know.

02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:10.300
It sounds stupid.

02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:10.540
Okay.

02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:13.100
Whatever it may happen or it may get canceled.

02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:15.020
You know, we'll see.

02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:19.260
Um, anyways, aside from that, this is kind of cool.

02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:24.700
So there's been a secret two player mode that's been discovered in super punch out.

02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:28.220
Um, remember that game that came out in 94?

02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:31.420
I mean, that was a while ago, but apparently no

02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:33.100
one's found it until now.

02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:41.420
And it allows you to basically control the other boxer, uh, with the second player controller.

02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:48.780
So the way you do it is you hold Y and R and then press air start on the start menu.

02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:53.580
And then it allows you to select which character and then player two gets to control it.

02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:56.220
It's like, it's like the ducks and duck hunt.

02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:01.340
And it works if you have the Nintendo switch online version, because, you know, it's just

02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:02.460
a ROM of the old game.

02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:05.900
So this is something that you can literally check out on your Nintendo switch right now,

02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:09.820
assuming you have a, um, uh, Nintendo switch online account.

02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:10.380
It's pretty cool.

02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:12.380
Yeah.

02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:12.700
All right.

02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:13.900
So very neat.

02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:14.700
Uh, dark soccer.

02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:18.460
What do you have for us for rapid fire news or stadium news?

02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:27.820
Stadia 4.26, uh, is putting in a claim all for pro games, uh, and some new, uh, language,

02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:28.700
uh, options.

02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:33.980
So, um, you know, cause normally when you have, when you get the free games, you go through

02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:37.340
one by one and click claim, but now you're going to get a claim all so that you can just

02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:38.060
get them all.

02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:45.580
Um, they also, uh, and basically these come from just, you know, uh, digging through the

02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:56.140
APKs, um, but they also are putting out, uh, some, uh, some, uh, language options, including,

02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:58.860
uh, uh, Spanish.

02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:05.100
Um, they're actually, I think, or they're doing both Castilian Spanish and Mexican Spanish.

02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:15.180
Um, and then they're doing, um, uh, Turkish, apparently they're also doing, uh, uh, Caribbean

02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:15.740
Spanish.

02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:20.860
And then, uh, and also a few other ones on here from what it looks like.

02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:26.540
Um, they're also, there's references to a, my library link, but no one really knows what

02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:27.100
that's about.

02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:33.020
And then there's also now references to a multi-stream and multi-stream controller.

02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:43.100
So, uh, looking also into like some other, uh, motion devices and, uh, tips and tricks.

02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:45.420
So kind of cool.

02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:48.620
All right.

02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:58.460
But yeah, I, I, I love when a company realizes that not everyone speaks the same version

02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:04.620
of a language, you know, like even British and Canadian English is a little bit different

02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:05.420
from each other.

02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:05.980
Sure.

02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:06.780
Yeah.

02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:12.060
So there's words that are fully acceptable to say here in the US that are completely

02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:16.700
unacceptable in England, as we know from Beyonce's edits.

02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:16.860
Yeah.

02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:17.740
Lizzo and Beyonce.

02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:17.900
Yeah.

02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:18.700
Yeah.

02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:24.380
So I think that it's, it's really, really good.

02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:28.700
I think that that's a great thing that they're doing, you know, understanding that, that

02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:31.260
it may be the same language, but they're not spoken the same way.

02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:35.020
It was, I was going to say that kind of goes the other way too, because, you know, there's

02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:41.100
the see you next Tuesday word that is, you know, a very common, uh, slang and overseas.

02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:44.220
Everybody in the UK right now, I'm using, I'm using, oh yes.

02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:44.380
Right.

02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:45.260
Cause that too.

02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:51.020
Uh, but yeah, but that word is, um, very, very, very offensive, um, here.

02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:53.260
So, um, yeah, I say it all the time.

02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:59.100
I don't even, you know, I have way too many British and Australian friends.

02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:00.220
I know.

02:05:00.220 --> 02:05:03.580
I kind of, I got in a habit when JJ was visiting.

02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:10.620
Anyway, one of my, one of my drag queen friends, miss Patsy declined to love you.

02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:11.100
Mean it.

02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:12.380
All right.

02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:15.980
Shifting gears a little bit, shifting guilty gears a little bit.

02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:16.480
Haha.

02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:20.860
Let's talk about something that was announced, announced at Evo last week.

02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:23.900
I think it was just about the time we were wrapping up OLR last week.

02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:29.580
But they did announce on, uh, the end of the stream, uh, or sorry, at the end of Evo, uh,

02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:33.820
that there was going to be some new DLC that was coming to guilty gear X two.

02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:34.320
I'm sorry.

02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:35.820
Sorry.

02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:37.660
Not, that was the, that was the older game.

02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:42.940
This is a new DLC that was coming out for guilty your strive, excuse me, uh, a character

02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:49.660
that originally was in guilty your X to Bridget, uh, a character that uses a yo-yo and a mechanized,

02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:51.020
uh, teddy bear.

02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:54.620
Um, so, uh, Bridget is also a very popular character in the franchise.

02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:59.260
Uh, so it was probably a foregone conclusion that Bridget was going to be added to strive.

02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:01.100
So that was, uh, announced at Evo.

02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:05.820
Now, another interesting thing that happened, um, as part of the story plot.

02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:10.700
Once the, um, DLC was released and people were jumping into it and, uh, you know, exploring

02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:16.140
the story, it turns out that Bridget, um, is now a pretty cool representation in the

02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:20.620
game, uh, as Bridget was confirmed a trans character, uh, in the game.

02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:26.060
I can't confess to know the lore in the game, so I don't want to like misrepresent something.

02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:31.180
But my understanding is that, uh, it sounds like Bridget was kind of had a stereotypical

02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:33.580
feminine design in the series.

02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:38.380
Uh, previously, uh, the story that I'm looking at is she was born in an English village with

02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:42.540
a male twin and the village had a superstition that twins of the same gender were bad luck.

02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:46.780
So to avoid exiling her, sacrificing her, her parents raised her as a girl.

02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:52.700
Um, and there's some dialogue that happens where one of the characters says cow girl

02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:56.940
or a cowboy and Bridget responds, cow girl is fine because I'm a girl.

02:06:56.940 --> 02:07:01.980
So, um, and that pronoun swap is, uh, intended to reveal Bridget's trans identity.

02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:05.660
Again, I hope I'm reporting that right, but I'm not super familiar with the story in the

02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:06.460
series.

02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:11.020
Um, so it's, it's hard for me to say it's this or it's this, but, um, my understanding

02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:15.340
is it's, uh, some representation, um, maybe unexpected.

02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:16.860
Again, I don't know, I don't follow the series.

02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:18.620
I don't know if it was expected or not.

02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:21.580
Um, but, uh, more representation is always a great thing.

02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:22.780
So, um, pretty cool to see.

02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:26.620
And a lot of people on Twitter, uh, were very happy to, um, hear about that.

02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:28.300
So, all right.

02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:33.500
Anyhow, uh, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates

02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:35.660
of some games coming out near you soon.

02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:37.260
We'll start with the U S slow key.

02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:41.740
So this week we've got fashion police squad coming out on PC.

02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:43.660
Oh, you have, you've had your eye on that one.

02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:45.420
Yeah, that looks fun.

02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:49.580

Cause it's been on the Epic store.

02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:01.740
It's been in beta, so now it's actually out.

02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:02.140
Got it.

02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:02.780
The real deal.

02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:03.280

Oh, it's Madden time already, huh?

02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:06.380
All right.

02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:07.100
Yep.

02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:10.540
Well, traveling to Japan, I don't know why there's such a stark difference

02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:13.580
between the U S which is full of releases this week, especially with

02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:17.580
Madden, uh, and Japan, but Japan has one release this week on the PlayStation

02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:19.180
four and five it's a vampire.

02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:23.020
The masquerade swung song gets its release in Japan this week.

02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:25.900
Um, that's, I believe this just recently came out here.

02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:27.740
That's that's it.

02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:29.500
Uh, it's the only release in Japan this week.

02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:32.300
Again, I don't know why the difference, I don't know if it's because maybe

02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:34.860
Madden isn't as big of a deal over there or something.

02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:38.220
It's more FIFA or whatever, but, or, um, yeah, I just.

02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:40.700
Because they know what real football is.

02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:41.580
I guess so.

02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:44.540
I, I, yeah, it's just a much slower week.

02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:46.940
So I will go over to the UK and see how things look over there.

02:10:46.940 --> 02:10:47.500
Dark soccer.

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:53.420
Only, uh, four things, uh, on the 16th, we have way of the Hunter for

02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:59.900
PlayStation, Xbox and a PC, uh, time Asia on PlayStation and Xbox on the 18th.

02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:03.740
And then on the 19th, Madden 23 and bug snacks on switch.

02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:05.420
Snacks.

02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:07.660
All right.

02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:11.020
Let's get some more headlines and then we will get to your calls.

02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:15.420
If we have any tonight over it, uh, vog network.com slash discord.

02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:17.820
Again, that's VOG network.com slash discord.

02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:20.780
If you want to join in the conversation throughout the week, I promise.

02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:24.300
We really, really limit the use of the everyone tag.

02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:25.020
So don't worry.

02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:28.780
And I know you probably have a hundred discords, but we will not spam you with

02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:30.540
everyone tags unless it's really important.

02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:32.540
I don't think I can't even remember the last time we used it.

02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:36.620
We don't use it every time we go live, but, uh, you can see when hosts go live

02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:39.900
on their personal streams, not within everyone tag, but if you keep your eye

02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:43.500
on the, uh, uh, Twitch channel, it does show you if, you know, Jamie does a

02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:47.020
stream or I do a stream or Bobby does a stream or we all do a stream, uh, all

02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:47.900
pings in that channel.

02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:51.180
So, uh, check that over at vog network.com slash discord.

02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:53.180
Meanwhile, we have some more stories for you.

02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:53.580
Loki.

02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:54.860
Yes.

02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:58.940
So apparently in attempt has been accused of firing, um, a worker for

02:11:58.940 --> 02:11:59.820
speaking up.

02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:06.380
So there's been some allegations according to, it's been filed with

02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:11.900
national labor relations board, um, seeing, and I guess, uh, against

02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:15.180
Nintendo and the contract hiring agency, Aston Carter.

02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:19.180
And apparently they're saying there's concerted activities or they're

02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:22.140
interfering with concerted activities of workers, including possible

02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:23.740
retaliation and coercion.

02:12:24.940 --> 02:12:29.180
Um, the actual allegations, like some of these were, it says within six

02:12:29.180 --> 02:12:33.980
months employer discharged an employee or employees, uh, because the

02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:37.180
employees engaged in protected concerted activities.

02:12:37.900 --> 02:12:42.940
By, I don't know, this is lawyer speak inter Alia, uh, protesting terms

02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:44.300
and conditions of employment.

02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:47.980
And in order to discourage employees from engaging in protected

02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:51.580
concerted activities, uh, it says within the previous six months, the

02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:56.220
employer has interfered with risk with restraint and courses employees

02:12:56.780 --> 02:13:00.860
in the exercise of rights protected by section seven of the act by

02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:04.700
maintaining the work rules that prohibit employees from discussing

02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:07.500
wages, hours, and other terms of conditions of employment.

02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:11.260
So basically, you know, sharing what they're, they're making that type

02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:11.660
of stuff.

02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:15.660
And, you know, there's a lot of companies that will try to get you

02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:18.300
not to do that, even though it is legal, at least in the United States

02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:18.780
to do that.

02:13:19.500 --> 02:13:25.500
Um, so interesting people to talk about what they make and verify

02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:28.300
with your teammates, what they make for pay equity.

02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:30.860
Yeah.

02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:34.860
So, um, apparently there was a report that was published back in

02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:39.500
April, Nintendo's president, Doug Bowser said, I posted a message

02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:43.100
internally to employees saying that executive leadership team was

02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:46.700
reviewing the allegations and the company had zero tolerance policy

02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:49.420
for discrimination, harassment, intimidation.

02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:52.300
But apparently like, it sounds like it's still going on.

02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:56.380
And I also want to point out if you're kind of having that thought

02:13:56.380 --> 02:14:00.540
of like deja vu is didn't already talk about this a few weeks ago.

02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:02.620
No, because this is a second time.

02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:06.060
This is a new incident than what was talked about before.

02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:10.060
Although there are some very similar parallels here, um, including

02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:14.940
both Nintendo and the staffing agency being named, uh, in what's

02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:15.660
going on here.

02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:18.860
And it's just, um, it's kind of showing that like, you know, I know

02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:23.180
Nintendo, uh, oftentimes in the industry is viewed as they do things

02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:25.820
differently over there and, you know, they get gaming in a different

02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:26.940
way and so forth.

02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:34.620
Uh, but some of the problems aren't necessarily, you know, invisible

02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:35.180
over there.

02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:40.300
So, um, so the ad, so what they said that also the, some of the

02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:43.820
sources that were familiar with what was going on here said that

02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:47.660
it stemmed from a contract employee asking questions about unions at

02:14:47.660 --> 02:14:52.140
a meeting and later being fired over something, some sort of

02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:54.780
borderline violation of their NDA.

02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:58.220
So it's like kind of finding a reason to fire them.

02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:04.220
I wonder if some of this, the fact that it's showing up in the

02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:08.540
news and stuff is going to have Nintendo kind of realign some

02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:12.300
things, or if this, they, they just try to make this mysteriously

02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:13.500
go away, like the first time.

02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:14.720
Maybe.

02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:15.780
Yeah.

02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:17.760
Well, thanks for bringing it to light anyway.

02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:19.600
So it's unfortunate, but, uh, yeah.

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:23.520
Uh, as 200 Matt points out, it's an epidemic in the industry, not

02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:26.400
just one or two companies it's everywhere and it sucks.

02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:29.120
And I think that's one reason why when it is Nintendo, it really

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:33.200
catches our attention because Nintendo, unfortunately it's in the

02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:33.700
same boat.

02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:38.480
So it may not be quite as horrifically mismanaged at the top as

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:40.960
some of these other organizations we've been talking about, but

02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:42.720
it's not to say the problems don't exist.

02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:49.520
Well, it's really bad for contractors because they, they it's, they

02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:50.640
could get you for anything.

02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:52.480
Really, they could get you for anything.

02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:54.080
And it's ridiculous.

02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:54.580
Yeah.

02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:55.680
All right.

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:59.200
Well, let's, uh, let's, let's revisit some classics again, not

02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:02.000
the classic game of the week, but something else in the classics

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:02.960
department, dark Sakura.

02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:09.280
Um, well, there's, uh, uh, more games, uh, announced for the

02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:12.480
Sega, uh, the, uh, mega drive mini too.

02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:17.520
Um, so, uh, of course it's coming out, um, in North America

02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:19.440
and Japan on October 27th.

02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:27.120
Um, it is, uh, going to include for cartridge titles, the, uh,

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.520
new, uh, announcements.

02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:32.960
So we have gang ground fantasy star, two populace, uh,

02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:36.880
sorcery and togyo King colossus and viewpoint.

02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:41.760
And then the, uh, mega CD titles echo the dolphin CD robo

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:46.160
lest, which I own both of those romances, the three kingdoms

02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:50.720
Shin Megami Tensei and Tenka Fubo a touch, you know, uh, local.

02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:56.240
This is sounding like a pretty cool little device.

02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:57.840
I hope I can find one.

02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:02.880
Does this sound like it's going to be easy to get in your pre-order?

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:03.440
Yeah, that's true.

02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:04.160
That's true.

02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:08.240
As she says, I pre is doing that as one of the masses.

02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:10.240
I pre-ordered the NA Genesis mini too.

02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:12.960
Even though the shipping is 25 bucks for international shipping.

02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:13.680
It's just annoying.

02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:15.200
That's the only way to get it.

02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:17.120
So, all right.

02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:18.880
Just a few more stories for you, Loki.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:20.560
All right.

02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:26.560
And so EA is, uh, basically claiming that, Hey, you know what, you know,

02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:29.280
those loot boxes that you guys always complain about with FIFA.

02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:32.560
Well, it's actually, you know, what people love those loot boxes.

02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:33.600
They love them.

02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:38.480
And I mean, I understand what they're saying because, you know,

02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:42.960
they, they're making dunk on them there.

02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:47.280
Well, no, they're making the claim that we will hardly believe that ultimate team in the,

02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:53.920
the food packs, um, have been, which have been part of the game for more than a decade are

02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:55.920
part of the FIFA that players love.

02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:01.680
Fans love that game reflects, uh, the real world excitement, strategy of building, managing

02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:05.600
a squad, giving players a choice to spend if they want is fair.

02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:11.520
The reason why I think that they're saying that they love them is because they're making

02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:16.320
so much money from them because people are buying them and because people are buying them.

02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:19.200
But I don't know if people necessarily love them.

02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:24.400
I think that there's a lot, a good percentage of people that are pressured into buying them

02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:28.880
because either they're susceptible to that type of practice or frustration or whatever

02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:30.000
the case may be.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:30.400
Loki.

02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:31.440
I got some breaking news.

02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:32.480
I have some breaking news.

02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:36.320
EA is saying right now that people love taxes.

02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:38.400
People love taxes.

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:41.120
Loki, everybody's paying them.

02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:44.640
Well, except some people, most people are paying taxes.

02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:47.120
I'm actually kind of a fan of taxes.

02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:49.200
But yeah.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:50.880
All right.

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:52.080
You'd love to be contrarian.

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:52.400
All right.

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:54.640
I'm a big socialist.

02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:55.040
I know.

02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:01.040
I like my taxes when they go for things like infrastructure and roads and education and

02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:03.680
stuff like that that we probably wouldn't afford if we didn't have taxes.

02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:04.000
All right.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.440
Thanks for poking a hole in my joke.

02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:06.480
Finish your story, Loki.

02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:11.680
So I mean, yeah, that's the argument that they're trying to make is basically that,

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:12.400
hey, you know.

02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:18.080
The people buy them, we make tons of money off of them, and so therefore people love

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:18.400
them.

02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:20.880
I don't know that's necessarily true, though.

02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:25.760
And obviously there's other issues with it, like the fact that it may be addictive, like

02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:27.040
gambling and stuff like that.

02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:32.160
It has the same type of, you know, feedback for like a person when they're purchasing

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:33.680
those and opening them up and stuff.

02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:40.640
So I mean, obviously, if it was all fun and games, then they wouldn't be banned in a few

02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:45.920
countries already because it goes against their gambling laws or they wouldn't be, you

02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:52.240
know, catching the attention of congressmen because it's it.

02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:55.440
Sure, I get it.

02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:56.560
Like loot box.

02:19:56.560 --> 02:20:00.880
People do buy those and there's a lot like people that will buy large quantities of those.

02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:04.720
Hell, there's like streamers out there that will pay hundreds of thousands of dollars

02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:08.400
for like DLC for games because it's content.

02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:09.440
Diablo immortal.

02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:11.360
Yeah, which is horrible.

02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:13.120
But like, that's what they're going to use.

02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:17.680
Like one person paid us a hundred thousand dollars.

02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:20.320
Like, of course, we're going to keep doing it.

02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:24.400
Yeah.

02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:28.640
And yeah, and that Diablo immortal, you know, even though I say that kind of tongue in cheek,

02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:32.720
it's it's the same thing because that game is making lots and lots and lots of money.

02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:36.320
And I'm not so sure it deserves to make as much money as it's making.

02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:39.760
But a lot of this content creators out there, you know, you've heard the horror stories

02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:42.400
about somebody spending a hundred thousand dollars and all this stuff.

02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:46.400
Sure, that's just one person, but it's one person spending a hundred thousand.

02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:48.320
How many others are spending thousands of dollars?

02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:49.360
And it adds up.

02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:50.640
It's it's wild.

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:53.120
So all right.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:55.920
Anyhow, one more story for you.

02:20:55.920 --> 02:21:00.000
And this is in the sadness department, but I'm sure many of you have heard this week

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:05.920
that we lost Olivia Newton-John, of course, is the you know, everybody knows Olivia Newton-John

02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:06.480
from Greece.

02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:11.520
If you're Dark Soccer, I was just about to say, if you let me finish.

02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:18.800
It was Xanadu, which had that animation part in there that was done by Don Bluth, who did

02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:23.600
Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, you know, had that little bit in Xanadu.

02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:30.080
But of course, of course, of course, we have to mention what you might wonder, what does

02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:32.640
Olivia Newton-John have to do with video games?

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:38.560
Well, I would hope I would hope you know where this show has its roots, and that is with

02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:39.840
Dance Dance Revolution.

02:21:39.840 --> 02:21:44.000
And the very first song many people played in Dance Dance Revolution back in the day,

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:49.520
I know it was the first song I ever played, was a cover by the Olivia Project who covered

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:53.120
Olivia Newton-John songs, and it was much cheaper to get the rights to those.

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:57.200
A cover of Olivia Newton-John called Have You Never Been Mellow.

02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:02.240
Now, if your first time you played DDR was on a third mix machine, perhaps you actually

02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:08.400
played on Xanadu, which was another Olivia Project song that was in DDR.

02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:12.720
And what's really funny is that there's some commentary I'm seeing on that where people

02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:18.240
thought the movie Xanadu was about like a demon princess or something because of the

02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:25.840
background in DDR, because it has a very strange, like, shadowy lady figure with eyes.

02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:31.840
And it's like, no, Xanadu is about a roller rake and a muse.

02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:33.520
And it has Gene Kelly in it.

02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:33.760
Yeah.

02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:36.560
It was Queen Kelly's last acting role.

02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:36.800
Yeah.

02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:45.600
So we watched Xanadu in my dorm room, me and Finara, when Gene Kelly died, and our other

02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:46.400
friends there.

02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:51.760
And then I watched Xanadu after Olivia Newton-John died, and I played the soundtrack on my stream.

02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:57.040
Well, all of her stuff, not all the ELO stuff, because, I mean, Electric Light Orchestra.

02:22:57.920 --> 02:23:01.120
And she was also in...

02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:05.200
Actually, my favorite song that she did was from another movie with John Travolta that

02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:07.680
for the life of me, I can't remember the name because it's not a good movie.

02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:13.040
But Twist of Fate.

02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:15.520
Oh, where the song comes from?

02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:16.560
Yeah.

02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:19.680
Well, the song is what I like.

02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:22.960
Although the video is like fucking weird.

02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:26.240
But there's a great lip sync on Drag Race.

02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:29.440
And Olivia Newton-John was there, and it was Katya versus Sasha Bell.

02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:29.840
Oh, yeah.

02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:30.320
Yeah.

02:23:30.320 --> 02:23:30.880
That one was...

02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:31.760
I remember that.

02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:35.600
But that is, though, my favorite Olivia Newton-John song.

02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:38.400
And she was looking really well.

02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:39.840
Oh, she was.

02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:41.440
Whenever I see her on TV.

02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:44.080
She had battled cancer several times, unfortunately.

02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:46.880
That's stage four metastatic breast cancer.

02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:51.280
Now, Bubby Blackwolf in chat points out, I thought Butterfly was people's first.

02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:52.720
Well, here's the thing.

02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:56.320
In the original DDR game, there was only so many songs.

02:23:56.320 --> 02:24:01.360
And the easiest song, the one footer song was that.

02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:03.280
So most people started there.

02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:04.240
But here's the thing.

02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:07.520
Most games of DDR were about three songs back then.

02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:12.640
So you would play Have You Never Been Mellow, Boom Boom Dollar, which was the two footer,

02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:14.960
and then Butterfly, which was the three footer.

02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:17.040
So Butterfly was kind of in your first set.

02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:21.840
And Butterfly was also the song that like, have you never been mellow, you may or may

02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:26.000
not have recognized depending on how much you knew about 70s hits and so forth.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:31.200
But like, Butterfly was like that uniquely DDR sound to it.

02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:32.320
You know, that really started.

02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:34.480
And it's got a catchy fucking hook.

02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:37.840
That's not to say the Olivia Newton-John song doesn't, but that was more of a slow

02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:38.160
jam.

02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:40.320
It was meant to be the starter song.

02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:47.280
Butterfly had a very catchy hook that, you know, that whole thing that made it stick

02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:47.840
with people.

02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:49.840
And so they remember that.

02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:52.720
And of course, you know, some people didn't start with the easiest song.

02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:54.320
They might have amped it up a little bit.

02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:57.120
So or they didn't start on a 1.0 machine.

02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:03.040
They may have started on a USA mix, which I don't think did the USA mix have Butterfly?

02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:03.680
I don't think it did.

02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:05.920
It had Boys by Smile DJ, but not Butterfly.

02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:07.280
I had the Speed Mix.

02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:09.600
May have had the Uprising one.

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:10.100
Yeah.

02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:16.240
There is something that is worth noting is that when Have You Never Been Mellow came

02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:20.560
out, it was when she was being marketed as a country singer.

02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:25.200
And it was her first charting single in Japan.

02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:26.880
No, it wasn't on there.

02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:30.080
Yeah, no, I know the original Butterfly wasn't on USA mix.

02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:30.640
I remember that.

02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:33.200
The Speed Mix, I think was, but not the original.

02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:34.400
No, neither.

02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:35.120
Really?

02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:36.880
Okay, interesting.

02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:40.080
It also makes me think that that's why that song was in DDR.

02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:44.960
It's very easy to confuse third mix with USA mix because they had the same interface.

02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:49.360
So sometimes it kind of blurs together a little bit, but I distinctly remember Boys

02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:52.240
by Smile DK was like the song that was in there.

02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:56.160
And then Boom Boom Dollar was definitely in it because that ended up being kind of in

02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:56.640
there.

02:25:56.640 --> 02:25:56.960
What?

02:25:58.080 --> 02:25:59.360
No, that was third mix.

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:01.600
It was in the home version then.

02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:04.640
It had to have been.

02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:06.080
Maybe.

02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:06.720
Wow.

02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:08.480
If I forgot that, boy, oh boy.

02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:13.040
You think we're talking about games that were 20 years old or something?

02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:14.400
Oh my gosh.

02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:15.920
She was in Sharknado 5.

02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:17.440
Oh, was she?

02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:18.320
That's funny.

02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:21.280
And I'm also like, wait, there was a Sharknado 5?

02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:25.200
All right, we're going to get to the listener round table.

02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:30.880
We want to invite your chat comments, your emails, your tweets, and Discord calls over

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:35.440
at our green room over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:36.400
One last little thing.

02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:38.560
The movie I couldn't think of the name of is Two of a Kind.

02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:39.680
Oh, okay.

02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:41.300
Okay.

02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:46.260
I don't think I ever saw that, but I know she did make that other movie with John Travolta

02:26:46.260 --> 02:26:46.900
after the fact.

02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:47.700
I just never saw it.

02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:49.860
So, all right.

02:26:49.860 --> 02:26:54.020
I'm checking quickly to see if we got any tweets this week over at OLR.

02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:57.460
I'll check in with Dark Soccer to see if anybody emailed us.

02:26:57.460 --> 02:27:00.340
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:01.940
We just had garbage.

02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:03.780
Garbage.

02:27:03.780 --> 02:27:04.580
Which I deleted.

02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:11.460
And I will say we had one tweet this week from Office Underscore Stop, who tweeted us

02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:13.060
during last week's show.

02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:16.580
And I thought this was pretty cool because they actually showed off their setup here

02:27:16.580 --> 02:27:20.420
Sunday night with Twitch, VOG Network, OLR, and the Steam Deck.

02:27:20.420 --> 02:27:24.740
And for those of you that are listening on the podcast feed, they've got OLR up on the

02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:28.900
television, a Steam Deck on their lap, and then what was the other thing they named?

02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:33.140
Something else multitasking on the laptop in front of them.

02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:35.060
That's an impressive amount of multitasking.

02:27:35.060 --> 02:27:35.780
But you know what?

02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:39.300
Hey, if we're your background noise, I'll take it.

02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:42.900
I'm happy to be your background noise.

02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:48.500
And Bobby Black Wolf points out that doesn't look like OLR on the TV.

02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:51.700
No, it is the Bobby Black Wolf logo.

02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:53.780
But I will point out, it's probably very hard to see.

02:27:53.780 --> 02:27:58.340
It says underneath that Bobby Black Wolf logo, thanks for watching.

02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:01.300
Meaning your show is over.

02:28:04.100 --> 02:28:09.060
They were preparing for OLR, but I'm glad that they spent all of Sunday night here at

02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:10.180
the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:12.260
So appreciate that and the tweet.

02:28:12.260 --> 02:28:14.180
I'd love to see other people set up.

02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:19.060
If you have a complex system of multitasking while you participate with OLR, to be honest,

02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:19.860
I'd love to see it.

02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:20.900
Tweet us at OLR.

02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:22.180
I'll retweet.

02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:22.680
I will.

02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:24.100
I love retweeting.

02:28:24.100 --> 02:28:25.140
Did I retweet that one?

02:28:26.580 --> 02:28:27.460
I don't know if I did.

02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:30.420
Maybe I quote tweeted it.

02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:31.540
Oh, one quote tweet.

02:28:31.540 --> 02:28:32.100
Oh, yes, I did.

02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:33.060
I quote tweeted it.

02:28:33.220 --> 02:28:36.180
So send us your setups for OLR.

02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:38.340
Twitter.com slash OLR.

02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:42.420
All right, so no emails, no other tweets.

02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:45.380
How about any last minute stories or things from Loki?

02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:47.140
No, I don't have anything.

02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:47.640
All right.

02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:48.840
Wow.

02:28:51.060 --> 02:28:51.940
No one's calling?

02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:53.540
I know we don't have calls either.

02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:58.420
Well, you know, honestly, it was kind of a slower news week, all things considered.

02:28:58.420 --> 02:29:01.780
I mean, again, Jason kind of razzed us in the intro there about the announcement of an

02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:05.300
announcement, and you heard the Japanese release dates there.

02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:09.620
We are in that kind of end of summer period where, you know, it's going to start to ramp

02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:11.700
up once we get past about Labor Day.

02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:16.660
Then that's when the holidays, you know, pumpkin spice lattes hit Starbucks, and then that's

02:29:16.660 --> 02:29:19.700
when, you know, things start to really ramp up.

02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:22.580
So anyway, gingerbread latte wins.

02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:27.140
Well, remember, all that stuff is kind of I want to say it's over for me, but it's not

02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:28.660
what it was for me anymore.

02:29:28.660 --> 02:29:30.340
Pumpkin candles are all I get.

02:29:30.900 --> 02:29:34.020
Find the sugar free syrup all the time, by the way.

02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:34.500
Yes.

02:29:34.500 --> 02:29:35.540
And I will get used to them.

02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:41.860
And I think I still have some from a grandpa care package from a year ago, but I will say

02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:42.360
this.

02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:48.260
The Starbucks competitor Dutch Brothers here in this area is well stocked with sugar free

02:29:48.260 --> 02:29:48.740
syrups.

02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:52.740
So I'm fully expecting they will have sugar free pumpkin.

02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:55.620
So I'll get to have my pumpkin here or there.

02:29:55.620 --> 02:29:57.460
And DGRMS brings up apple spice.

02:29:58.100 --> 02:30:03.460
The thing is, with as much as I got about the Rob loves everything pumpkin, people sometimes

02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:04.100
forgot.

02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:06.180
I also love the apple stuff.

02:30:06.180 --> 02:30:10.500
I also love the whatever drink that was the gingerbread, although I don't think they've

02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:13.460
had that for years, but I loved that when that was around.

02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:15.540
So just try this in the future.

02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:21.060
Get for anyone who liked the apple, get a tall chai latte and add one pump of the apple

02:30:21.060 --> 02:30:21.560
to it.

02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:23.220
It is a delight.

02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:25.460
Perfect.

02:30:25.460 --> 02:30:26.180
All right.

02:30:26.260 --> 02:30:29.780
So let's get everybody's final thoughts and then we'll wrap up.

02:30:29.780 --> 02:30:32.740
Dark Soccer, I know you probably want to use the restroom and stuff before you stream.

02:30:32.740 --> 02:30:34.900
So why don't you give us your final thought tonight?

02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:38.660
Fix the camping behavior.

02:30:38.660 --> 02:30:43.860
Take my advice and just teleport killers away from the hook for 10 seconds after they've

02:30:43.860 --> 02:30:46.500
hooked somebody and it will be perfect.

02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:47.300
The end.

02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:53.300
I'm excited to see what that Rebecca perk does to the meta because they're definitely

02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:53.940
targeting that.

02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:54.420
So we'll see.

02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:56.020
You might get your wish a little bit.

02:30:56.020 --> 02:30:57.380
My favorite thing out of that though.

02:30:57.380 --> 02:30:59.300
I hate the RPD is being split.

02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:00.660
I mean, I like the changes.

02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:04.020
They look good, but I like the full RPD because that is my pig map.

02:31:05.140 --> 02:31:10.020
But Wesker has heat powers and I love it.

02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:14.180
And I was watching LC do survivor bowling with it.

02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:17.700
Wesker's heat power is going to be very interesting in the full game.

02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:19.940
I'm excited to see Wesker's heat power is amazing.

02:31:19.940 --> 02:31:20.500
All right.

02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:21.060
Have a good stream.

02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:24.980
Hey, I forgot to say I forgot to say before, oh no, not for you.

02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:32.100
Just for in general, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please

02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:32.900
help us spread the word.

02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:36.260
Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:31:36.260 --> 02:31:38.500
but we need more voices to put out here on air.

02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:42.740
So leave a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you heard about

02:31:42.740 --> 02:31:43.780
Orange Launch Radio.

02:31:43.780 --> 02:31:46.020
All of that goes an awful long way as well.

02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:46.340
Okay.

02:31:46.340 --> 02:31:48.020
I just want to make sure I say that as well.

02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:49.060
I say it every week.

02:31:49.060 --> 02:31:53.300
It doesn't mean we get five star reviews, but I'm going to try, although I didn't check

02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:54.260
the store in the last couple of weeks.

02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:55.060
Maybe we did get one.

02:31:55.060 --> 02:31:58.660
So Loki, do you have a final thought for tonight?

02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:00.900
Um, yeah, I probably just try to stream more.

02:32:01.620 --> 02:32:01.940
You should.

02:32:01.940 --> 02:32:02.820
I can't wait to see it.

02:32:02.820 --> 02:32:03.320
I hope you do.

02:32:04.100 --> 02:32:04.600
Yeah.

02:32:06.260 --> 02:32:09.860
My final thought, Dragon Con, two and a half weeks away.

02:32:09.860 --> 02:32:11.300
Where did time go?

02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:16.100
Dragon Con, Twitch Con, a month after that.

02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:18.980
And then, which yes, I'm going.

02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:20.340
And I heard about all the safety.

02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:22.980
I know I kept cutting those stories about the safety changes.

02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:26.980
But yeah, they went back to being safe about it now.

02:32:27.780 --> 02:32:29.220
It's whatever for me.

02:32:29.220 --> 02:32:32.340
Like, you know, maybe I'm just riding this wave because I'm like, I had it.

02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:34.180
I'm immune for eight weeks now.

02:32:34.180 --> 02:32:37.460
So, but I'm just like, if they want me to wear a mask, fine, I'll wear a mask.

02:32:37.460 --> 02:32:43.940
But if not, like, we're getting to this point where it's like, what can you do at this point?

02:32:43.940 --> 02:32:47.620
You just have to kind of hope the virus keeps mutating in a direction where it is getting

02:32:47.620 --> 02:32:48.340
weaker and weaker.

02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:52.180
And that's the good news is the one that everybody's getting is a lot weaker than what it used

02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:52.740
to be.

02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:55.380
Not to minimize it, but it is.

02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:56.580
Look at the stats anyway.

02:32:58.260 --> 02:33:00.180
And then what was the other thing I was gonna say?

02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:03.140
Oh, then now I'm going to Seattle in November.

02:33:03.140 --> 02:33:04.820
So I'm really looking forward to that, though.

02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:06.020
So, all right.

02:33:06.820 --> 02:33:07.540
That's it.

02:33:07.540 --> 02:33:09.380
Have a great night, everybody.

02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:12.580
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:14.260
Have a wonderful night.

02:33:15.220 --> 02:33:15.620
Goodbye.
