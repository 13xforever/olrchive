00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
Some people know of the very early Internet meme All Your Bass. Some of those people know that the game's sequence footage and translation text comes from a game called Zero Wing. But what everyone should know is that whether or not you've played it already, soon many more people will have a remastered version of it to play, including other titles by developer Toaplan. Sign me up.

00:28.000 --> 00:37.440
This is just one internet trend generating story. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.440 --> 01:06.440
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 927 of our show for this August the 21st of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined every week by my co hosts say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:06.440 --> 01:12.440
I'd better be the only I don't know maybe there's a DarkSakura out there in Michigan somewhere.

01:12.440 --> 01:41.440
There actually was an evil Sakura for a while. And she actually dated Chris Tang, which is how I met him because I knew her. And the two of them came over, and he brought a like a CPS two unit for playing a Street Fighter and whatnot. And we played Bust to Move. That was how I learned about the game.

01:42.440 --> 01:47.440
But um, but no, I was I was dark first. There's I was back before Capcom did it.

01:48.440 --> 02:11.440
There's lots of Rob Roberts out there. There's I think once a rugby player, one owns a gun shop or something. If you look it up on if you look up Rob Roberts on YouTube, you get a gun person bunch of gun videos, which is like totally not me. And then I think there's a there's a politician in the UK who did a lot of shitty things from what I understand. So I've I've not haven't really followed it. But I'm like, Oh, great. I'm gonna get confused with that guy. So

02:11.440 --> 02:33.440
so to point this out, there was, you know, Jamie Summers was spelled J. A. I. M. E. S. O. M. M. E. R. S. and that was a bionic woman. So I truly was named after. But there's, but I spell my J. A. M. I. E. S. U. M. M. E. R. S. because it's different. And there's also a porn star who does that. Of course, of course, of course, there's always a porn star.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.980
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.160
My but my unmarried name.

02:41.780 --> 02:42.680
Also,

02:44.000 --> 02:44.920
matched

02:45.160 --> 02:47.640
something. You know, you got to be careful because you want to give it away.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.120
A friend's a former friend.

02:51.160 --> 02:54.120
Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. I remember that.

02:54.160 --> 03:03.420
He was spelled J. A. I. M. E. M. M. E. And for about a year, even after they broke up, and while they were together, I got his mail.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.760
And he would get some of mine, which is very interesting.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.360
So, all right.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.720
Also, say hello to the one and only.

03:12.720 --> 03:13.960
There is no other.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.800
Loki never, there is never heard that name used before anywhere.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.000
No, no, it's completely original.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.200
How are you doing, Loki?

03:23.200 --> 03:26.720
I mean, licensing my properties, make TV shows and stuff, of course.

03:26.720 --> 03:32.360
So. Well, I but the thing is, most people would probably assume

03:32.360 --> 03:35.720
that you're Loki after the Marvel Loki and you're not.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.400
Yeah. And I embrace both. It's fine.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.600
Yeah, that's that's good. That's good.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.600
So the same thing with the Street Fighter character.

03:44.600 --> 03:49.760
Oh, yeah. Although now people think it's from Naruto, but.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.600
Well, no, I cosplayed.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.680
No, actually, I didn't cosplay her. I cosplayed Tamari.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.680
Well, when it comes to video games and people that have been doing

03:59.680 --> 04:03.760
an online radio broadcast and podcast for way too long,

04:03.760 --> 04:07.200
we really are the one and only Rob Robert, star soccer and Loki.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.400
Get used to it. All right.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.200
We got a lot in store for tonight.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.720
A lot of gaming news to get into.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.680
Let's why don't we just get right into our kickoff topic for tonight,

04:16.680 --> 04:20.440
which is a story that has been making the rounds quite a bit this week.

04:20.960 --> 04:21.920
Do you want to get into this, Loki?

04:21.920 --> 04:23.520
You want me to tackle this?

04:23.520 --> 04:25.040
Because I got a lot to say about it, but.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.160
I mean, yeah, if you want to get into it, it's fine.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.280
OK, there's not much to it.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.600
So Spider-Man Remastered just came out on PC.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.040
So, you know, a lot of the Sony games are getting their PC releases. Right.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.880
So Spider-Man Remastered, of course, one of the big

04:39.880 --> 04:43.200
releases of the PlayStation four and five era. Right.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.400
So this has been a long awaited release on PC. And what does it mean?

04:47.600 --> 04:51.800
What is the big thing that happens when a game releases on PC

04:52.120 --> 04:54.960
from console that it didn't get on console, it gets on PC?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.880
Why do a lot of people want it on PC?

04:56.880 --> 05:00.080
Modding, mods, mods, mods. That's right.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.520
All the mods you can think of.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.120
And, you know, every everything you can think of was done in this game as well.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.280
You know, especially the quote unquote obvious things.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.240
Things like alternate Spider-Man skins.

05:11.280 --> 05:14.440
You want to make Spider-Man look like Miles Morales Spider-Man.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.040
Yes, of course, you can do that through mods and so on and so on.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.880
So with mods, the possibilities are endless.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.480
But I think you some of you that follow gaming culture

05:24.480 --> 05:27.600
and gaming social media, you probably know exactly what's coming up next.

05:28.200 --> 05:34.280
So on August 15th, a user on Nexus mods by the name of Mike Hawk.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.800
Because the year is 1989,

05:37.800 --> 05:41.360
and this is a phone call on The Simpsons to Moe's Tavern, clearly.

05:42.120 --> 05:48.840
Mike Hawk on Nexus uploaded a mod for Spider-Man Remastered

05:48.840 --> 05:53.400
that replaces Newton's prism artifacts

05:53.400 --> 05:54.800
with the stars and stripes.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.560
That's what the description said.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.560
That was its way of getting around keywords to basically say

05:59.560 --> 06:04.360
it took all of the rainbow flags that because the Spider-Man

06:04.360 --> 06:06.960
remaster game has a very accurate depiction of New York City

06:06.960 --> 06:09.720
and you know, the big diversity that you see in New York City.

06:10.080 --> 06:14.920
And it replaced the rainbow flag or the pride flags with American flags.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.840
Of which there are plenty.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.960
Of which there were, which already existed.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.600
Thank you for clarifying that, because that's important.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.680
Which already existed in the game.

06:22.680 --> 06:28.320
So long story short, I'm sure you were never expecting Mike Hawk

06:28.600 --> 06:31.920
to do this type of juvenile stuff online.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.240
But there you go.

06:33.240 --> 06:37.760
And this, of course, as you can imagine, opened up a big old can of worms,

06:37.760 --> 06:41.160
because obviously, you know, it's interesting

06:41.160 --> 06:45.760
because there's a lot of times with mods we ask ourselves, what's the point?

06:46.280 --> 06:50.280
Like, you know, when it's like, you know, nudie mods and what's the point?

06:50.520 --> 06:53.680
You know, and a lot of times it's because we can.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.560
But with this one, no, really.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.520
What's the point of doing this?

07:00.080 --> 07:04.600
And a lot of people are saying it's hate.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.840
It's erasure. It's ridiculous.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.320
Nexus mods was kind of forced to intervene, as you can imagine.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.000
They had to quickly remove the mod and banned the creator.

07:16.600 --> 07:20.640
And they found that the creator had made a sock puppet account to do this.

07:20.640 --> 07:25.000
And Nexus mods in a blog post said the fact that the user needed to make

07:25.000 --> 07:30.280
a sock puppet like a coward to upload the mod showed their intent to troll.

07:30.760 --> 07:33.800
The creation of the sock puppet removed any doubt and made it

07:33.800 --> 07:35.720
a very easy decision for us.

07:35.720 --> 07:40.160
Both of the sock puppet account and the user's main account have been banned.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.720
Of course, we're saying that if if he had done it on his main account,

07:44.760 --> 07:46.720
he would have just gotten a warning

07:46.720 --> 07:50.400
and had the mod taken down and then banned if it went back up. Right.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.400
But it was very clear.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.160
I love that they minced no words, especially

07:55.440 --> 07:57.920
if this doesn't suit your morality.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.080
Here's how to delete your account.

08:00.080 --> 08:00.920
That would. Yeah.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.640
Nexus mods. Beautiful.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.680
I'm a fan of zero fucks.

08:04.680 --> 08:11.040
Alan uses Alan mods games a lot, and he is a heavy user of Nexus mods.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.520
And I support that 100 percent.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.560
You remember how my Mass Effect 3 looked because I downloaded

08:17.560 --> 08:21.000
the high res mods and my Dragon Age mods and all of that.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.280
Unfortunately, once on the Internet, always on the Internet.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.720
And so the mods out there, we know that it was on the Internet

08:27.720 --> 08:30.680
archive at one point, but I think that it got pulled from there, too.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.480
But, you know, it's it's it's out there.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.840
It's that people put a lot of modding sites took it down.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.360
Unfortunately, because of a lot of this controversy.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.840
Now that just makes people want to install it more, you know,

08:42.840 --> 08:44.520
because people want to be edgy.

08:44.520 --> 08:47.800
And in their comments on Twitter, they like to talk about,

08:48.040 --> 08:53.280
oh, the snowflakes are triggered because we were moved their pride flags.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.120
And they're they hate America.

08:56.320 --> 09:00.480
They hate America because they can't stand to see the American flag.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.920
I have a different take on that.

09:03.920 --> 09:07.360
You see, you are using the American flag

09:07.360 --> 09:11.040
in this mod for your act of coward, cowardice.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.440
You are hiding behind the American flag

09:14.440 --> 09:19.560
and you are allowing the American flag to be a symbol of cowardice.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.760
That is what you're doing.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.840
You are being offensive towards this American flag symbol.

09:24.840 --> 09:28.320
I mean, we all know this argument is absolutely ridiculous.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.840
It's absolutely ridiculous.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.080
It's like putting a child in a shirt that says fuck you

09:33.240 --> 09:35.560
and then sending that child to Disneyland and then going,

09:35.680 --> 09:39.040
why would Disney kick a child out of Disneyland?

09:39.200 --> 09:40.440
I don't understand.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.800
Why does Disney hate children?

09:42.800 --> 09:46.960
Or in another wonderful Internet brainchild moment,

09:47.120 --> 09:50.760
it's like going into a PetSmart and yelling at the employees about

09:50.760 --> 09:54.320
why do they have pride stuff up at a PetSmart

09:54.440 --> 09:59.280
and why does PetSmart support all this bullshit that people want to tie

09:59.280 --> 10:02.360
to LGBT stuff like pedophilia and all this garbage.

10:02.360 --> 10:05.000
Stop making my frogs gay, damn it.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.040
Damn you, PetSmart.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.520
They did witness a rant like that once.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.440
No, I know. That's why I specifically called that out.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.080
But the employee was awesome.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.720
Oh, no. Yeah, they were awesome.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.320
And like. No, you weren't there for this.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.400
This is. Oh, this is an Alabama PetSmart.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.320
Oh, I'm talking about the PetSmart video I saw.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.360
Sorry. Go ahead. No, no, no.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.840
I'm talking about when I personally witnessed. Oh, OK.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.680
And the the person's going off, this is God.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.920
And employees like, here's the corporate address.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.440
Talk to them. I'm on my break.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.800
I don't get people like it's just like

10:41.640 --> 10:42.640
just who cares?

10:42.640 --> 10:45.440
Like like if it bothers you, just whatever you like.

10:45.760 --> 10:49.480
It's not that being included in the game is not really.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.640
What's it doing to you?

10:51.640 --> 10:52.840
Like, stop.

10:52.840 --> 10:55.440
I think their take are these types of people.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.960
Their take is like they're shoving it down my throat.

10:58.560 --> 11:03.160
Well, yeah, but like because, of course, it's all projection

11:03.160 --> 11:06.280
and typically the projection of this stuff that they're doing.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.840
I mean, like you're shoving that super American pride down

11:09.840 --> 11:11.640
to everybody's throats as well.

11:11.640 --> 11:12.520
Not that it's right.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.960
It's really just bigotry, but, you know, whatever you want to call it.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.520
I mean, it's the same thing.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.720
It's just. I don't know.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.240
Like put it this way.

11:21.240 --> 11:25.560
It's like trans, you know, gay, straight.

11:25.560 --> 11:29.120
I mean, well, pretty much anyone non-binary.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.320
I mean, they're not like trying to come after you.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.440
I mean, they're just trying to live their damn lives and just. Yeah.

11:35.640 --> 11:40.200
You know, exist and maybe get the same type of freedoms

11:40.200 --> 11:41.720
and rights as everybody else.

11:41.720 --> 11:46.640
And God forbid, you know, everybody's like, well, the Bible says like,

11:46.640 --> 11:51.080
as that's the only, you know, dictator of everything in the world.

11:51.080 --> 11:51.840
You know, of course.

11:51.840 --> 11:55.040
Royale says that I can get trapped on an island and kill my schoolmates.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.520
That's a big book.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.480
It's it's technically both both are technically books.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.320
And correct. Both are books.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.240
You know, if I if I learn how to,

12:10.680 --> 12:13.480
you know, shoot an arrow through 10 holes,

12:13.680 --> 12:17.120
then I can get a hot Greek wife named Penelope.

12:17.880 --> 12:21.880
I'm I am happy to let Loki continue his rant here.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.800
I am happy to let an ally

12:25.520 --> 12:27.200
say it the way it needs to be heard.

12:27.200 --> 12:31.640
Like, it's so stupid, like just the the downright evil stuff

12:31.640 --> 12:35.960
that like certain spectrums of the political,

12:35.960 --> 12:38.680
I guess, you know, the Republicans, we're just going to say it.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.880
They just going after people like in their basic rights

12:42.880 --> 12:47.160
and trying to strip them away from them, thinking that, oh, you know, save us.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.040
Oh, they're trying to teach our kids to be gay.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.960
They're trying to teach our kids to change their genders like.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.080
No, they're not.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.120
But these are the same people that are saying, you know, like, oh, hey, rock

12:57.120 --> 12:59.040
music's trying to make you worship the devil.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.920
Oh, hey, your comic books are trying to, you know.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.120
Corrupt your mind and also worship the devil, I'm sure.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.760
I mean, it's just

13:08.760 --> 13:10.600
when will these people just die?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.840
When will they just die off already?

13:12.840 --> 13:14.760
Like, come on.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.440
It all comes down to control, though. Control and money.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.640
It is. It actually is.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.640
It's it's controlling the narrative, which is exactly what they're trying

13:22.640 --> 13:24.800
to do in this situation, because they're turning this,

13:24.800 --> 13:28.000
you know, shutting down of pride flags and the pride movement into

13:28.040 --> 13:29.200
why do you hate America?

13:29.200 --> 13:30.280
That's exactly what it is.

13:30.280 --> 13:34.160
And it's this whole it's it's the whole, you know, what?

13:34.320 --> 13:37.680
Why do you keep shoving that gay shit down my throat,

13:37.840 --> 13:41.320
says individual walking into a pet smart, holding a camera,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.880
trying to live for a matter of black lives.

13:43.880 --> 13:47.440
My counter to them is why do you hate America?

13:48.280 --> 13:49.680
Thank you. Thank you.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.960
Because that's exactly what it is, because when you're using the American flag

13:52.960 --> 13:56.000
to to hide your cowardness behind,

13:56.240 --> 13:59.080
you are the ones who are the ball lickers

13:59.680 --> 14:03.360
or the people with the, you know, to quote, it's basically

14:04.280 --> 14:06.840
butchering the American flag to put the blue line on it.

14:08.680 --> 14:12.040
You know, yeah, it's this, but no,

14:12.160 --> 14:16.560
it isn't necessarily to control the narrative as well, especially,

14:16.560 --> 14:19.400
you know, anyone with a uterus knows this very well,

14:19.960 --> 14:23.640
is that it goes to controlling people.

14:24.520 --> 14:28.880
To have a population that will support their interests

14:29.480 --> 14:32.480
so that they can remain in power.

14:33.320 --> 14:37.960
Women, I'm just going to use women in general right now, just loose term.

14:39.200 --> 14:44.400
For example, yeah, we do have a lot more going for us now than we did.

14:44.400 --> 14:50.000
And we are kind of taking over a lot of things.

14:50.240 --> 14:54.000
And this has been considered male dominated territory.

14:54.200 --> 14:58.960
Well, same thing is also going on with, quote, heterosexual territory

14:59.640 --> 15:04.240
that and it's not that there are suddenly magically more gay,

15:04.240 --> 15:06.600
more trans, more ace, whatever people.

15:06.880 --> 15:11.160
The fact that the people are not hiding that anymore.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.560
And and and, you know,

15:15.400 --> 15:17.920
they want to go back

15:17.920 --> 15:22.440
to an era where their type was in control

15:22.440 --> 15:26.800
and they weren't the ones dying out and losing their control.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.120
That's all that it is.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.720
It's exactly why they remove certain pieces

15:33.720 --> 15:36.440
of education from school curriculums, for example.

15:38.120 --> 15:41.160
Think back to in terms I'm going to say like dark ages,

15:41.960 --> 15:48.080
that general era where the only people who were educated were rich males.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.880
Even women were rich, women were rarely educated

15:54.280 --> 15:59.280
and the the general populace, if they didn't have money, they can get educated.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.800
They were going to work

16:00.800 --> 16:05.320
because an educated population is something those in power fear.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.800
Yeah, that's why they're trying to promote non education, like even now

16:09.800 --> 16:12.960
they have, was it in Florida where they pass the bill where they can

16:13.240 --> 16:17.440
let just untrained veterans teach children now, which is fine.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.040
You know, like, I'm sure those people are nice, but.

16:21.320 --> 16:25.680
They're not teachers, they haven't gone through the training to do that, like.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.520
Well, and the other thing, too, though, is that, you know,

16:30.000 --> 16:33.640
what does it say, the the the victors write the history?

16:34.880 --> 16:37.320
Oh, no, history is written by the victors, that's the phrase.

16:37.760 --> 16:44.600
And they are teaching these these revisionist histories in school, which is.

16:45.480 --> 16:49.640
Like, if I didn't have teachers that were really open minded and said,

16:49.640 --> 16:52.400
no, what your your book says is wrong, this is what happened.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.400
Then I might not be the thinker that I am today.

16:56.880 --> 17:01.760
And this is something, you know, especially then with a lot of

17:01.760 --> 17:03.520
I'm going to throw Internet culture in on this, too,

17:03.520 --> 17:06.200
because it's also a big factor in this matter,

17:06.680 --> 17:11.360
is when you've got people spreading a false narrative and passing on,

17:11.840 --> 17:18.240
you know, hearsay and oh, so and so said this, it must be true.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.560
Or I heard, I heard, I heard.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.120
Or this tribal knowledge, for lack of a better description,

17:24.360 --> 17:29.160
as fact, when indeed it's not necessarily fact, it's half truths.

17:29.960 --> 17:35.520
But it's just enough out there to be detrimental

17:35.520 --> 17:39.040
to the growth of society in general and create these.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.640
Pockets of hatred, if you know what I mean.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.920
Whereas someone who is who's educated,

17:46.920 --> 17:50.720
who's been at an experience that, hey, no, it's not really like this.

17:51.680 --> 17:55.840
They should be speaking up and going, no, no, you're completely wrong.

17:56.440 --> 18:00.200
You know, I had another point that I was going to make,

18:00.200 --> 18:02.040
but right now I'm too disgusted.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.520
If I could quickly, I want to acknowledge our live chat,

18:04.520 --> 18:07.680
because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern,

18:07.680 --> 18:10.200
six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv

18:10.200 --> 18:11.280
slash Avog Network.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.400
And you can chat along.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.800
And a great part of the show and why we do this

18:14.800 --> 18:17.080
is that you all get to have your voices heard in chat

18:17.560 --> 18:20.040
or solicited through email and Twitter throughout the week.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.440
And we have a lot of great comments in chat,

18:22.440 --> 18:24.720
just a lot of support for what's being said here.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.080
And, you know, thank you. I appreciate it.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.360
Because, you know, I've heard I've certainly heard over the years

18:28.960 --> 18:33.520
people who are on the political ideology spectrum different than we are.

18:33.520 --> 18:37.840
And there comes a point like I do try to understand, I do try to listen.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.480
I try to educate and not attack. I really do.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.840
But there comes a point and especially after doing this for 20 years,

18:44.840 --> 18:46.680
you know, we've done this show for now 20 years.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.080
We've we've by far hit that point where it's like

18:49.320 --> 18:52.160
I am too old and I am too tired for this bullshit.

18:52.160 --> 18:56.760
And when it is my identity being attacked, which is what this is.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.680
This is what this is.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.840
And using an American flag to hide behind that attack.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.880
Yeah, I'm fucking pissed off.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.680
And yeah, I'm going to talk about it.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.160
And no, I'm not going to shut my mouth because you have a problem with it,

19:09.160 --> 19:11.920
because, you know, deep down, I'm right.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.120
What I'm going to do real quick in chat,

19:16.120 --> 19:18.400
and I'm sorry about this to our listeners,

19:18.400 --> 19:21.080
to listeners, you owe it to yourself to go look this up,

19:21.480 --> 19:24.200
is I am putting up a list of logical fallacies.

19:24.560 --> 19:28.360
Mm hmm. How to spot a logical fallacy in an argument,

19:28.760 --> 19:33.640
because a lot of these people who are doing religion

19:33.640 --> 19:36.480
or society or this, that and the other is their excuses.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.040
They're logical fallacies.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.000
It's like saying, oh,

19:42.760 --> 19:46.840
this person with sunglasses caused a car accident.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.440
I guess we need to ban sunglasses.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.520
You know, or yeah.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.800
And and I think the thing I hear all the time,

19:58.240 --> 20:01.680
I'm OK with gay people as long as they don't hit on me.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.920
Why would someone hit on you

20:04.920 --> 20:08.560
on behalf of your token gay friend in your circle or whatever?

20:08.720 --> 20:11.320
Allow me allow me to say this.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.800
Don't flatter yourself.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.840
Period. Or or or this one, too.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.680
You know what, what?

20:19.680 --> 20:22.400
And I'm assuming that the person saying this would be male,

20:22.400 --> 20:24.600
because I hear that more often.

20:24.600 --> 20:28.160
What if what if your lady friend tried to hit on you?

20:30.120 --> 20:32.880
It'd be exactly the same thing if you're not into her.

20:32.880 --> 20:36.880
You say no. End of story.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.640
It would probably be the only time that individual got hit on by a lady.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.680
Anyway, I'm not going to go there. All right.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.720
Well, now I'm being cheap.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.200
I'm going below the bell. That's not nice.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.480
I remember one of my uncles was like,

20:51.280 --> 20:55.440
they better not come anywhere near me or I'd like Uncle Wayne.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.000
No one wants to be around you, not even your family.

20:59.680 --> 21:04.080
Yeah, I said that that was actually the last time I spoke to my uncle.

21:05.080 --> 21:08.040
Pod culture and chat says, hell, I would be flattered.

21:08.120 --> 21:12.880
Nobody wants to hit on me that it's very easy to say, oh, thank you.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.560
I'm not interested, but I appreciate that compliment.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.440
Wow. How hard was that?

21:17.440 --> 21:21.520
There's an episode of Sailor Moon in Japan. Yeah.

21:22.160 --> 21:25.600
Where this one girl has like a little crush on Usagi.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.840
And Usagi very gently turns her down and says,

21:29.840 --> 21:33.240
but let's be let's be friends and mean it, you know. Yeah.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.200
It's that right there.

21:36.200 --> 21:40.480
I mean, yeah, it's a show for, you know, for preteen girls.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.880
Mostly that was the target age group.

21:43.560 --> 21:47.000
But to put it so simply and easily there.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.640
That's it. Or that other meme that goes around from Deep Space Nine

21:52.160 --> 21:54.640
of of Curzon and Jadzia.

21:55.760 --> 21:59.560
He goes, not Curzon, Curzon was her previous life.

22:00.360 --> 22:04.480
Gauran is saying, it's like, Curzon, my old friend.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.200
He goes, oh, I'm Jadzia now.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.800
Oh, Jadzia, my old friend.

22:07.800 --> 22:11.040
You know that like I love that scene.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.680
I fucking love Deep Space Nine anyway.

22:12.680 --> 22:16.800
But but I mean, it can be that easy.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.920
Just love people.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.440
You know, I mean, I don't love those people, but I'm saying.

22:24.600 --> 22:28.160
Be just be a good person, you know, just

22:29.040 --> 22:31.880
stop trying to inflict your world view on other people.

22:31.920 --> 22:35.040
Now, I back to the golden rule, the Internet, don't be a dick.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.400
I'm going to go, though, into one little piece of psychology,

22:38.400 --> 22:42.240
and there is something about what's considered a core belief.

22:43.480 --> 22:48.280
And these are, you know, like for the people that you introduce

22:48.280 --> 22:53.240
proof of something that shakes a formative thought, a formative belief.

22:54.440 --> 22:58.480
Then it actually does cause like a

22:59.040 --> 23:02.200
sort of a psychological.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.360
Thing, I can't really explain that.

23:04.360 --> 23:08.400
I mean, this word seizure comes to mind, but it's not that just sort of like

23:08.400 --> 23:14.680
a momentary shutdown because it goes against an ingrained

23:14.680 --> 23:17.040
core belief, something that makes them who they are.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.800
So in from a psychological standpoint, yes, I understand

23:20.240 --> 23:23.440
the change is very difficult and it takes a very long time.

23:23.720 --> 23:27.920
And you have to be able to recognize that you could be wrong

23:28.480 --> 23:30.800
and be willing to make the change. Yeah.

23:31.400 --> 23:37.360
But when you have an entire group of people with this core belief,

23:37.360 --> 23:38.400
and I'm going to say it right now,

23:38.400 --> 23:41.320
the Southern Baptist Church is a cult. I grew up in it.

23:42.760 --> 23:48.280
But when you have when you have that going on,

23:48.680 --> 23:53.000
you need to work on the narrative around it

23:53.000 --> 23:57.920
and bring it into their purview in such a way

23:58.920 --> 24:05.320
that it's going to start shifting that core thought, that core value.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.720
It's not going to happen all at once.

24:07.720 --> 24:11.120
As much as people want to say, as much as people think a big debate

24:11.120 --> 24:14.240
is going to go on, it's going to have to happen gradually.

24:14.240 --> 24:18.400
And on a societal level is something that Loki brought up earlier.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.960
They're going to die out.

24:20.960 --> 24:25.200
We already see now, even for some of these hardcore people,

24:25.520 --> 24:31.400
a level of acceptance that they that their predecessors would not have had.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.160
There's some younger younger

24:35.880 --> 24:39.160
folks out there that are very loud and even crazier.

24:39.160 --> 24:42.080
So like, I hope they all die out.

24:42.080 --> 24:46.960
But some and somebody I just I kept not reading these chat comments.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.160
Sorry, because we kept having other thoughts.

24:48.160 --> 24:51.440
But Mike Defton chat earlier said the thing is, even if those people die,

24:51.440 --> 24:54.240
their teaching still continues with their offspring. Right.

24:54.240 --> 24:57.800
So it's education is is the big thing.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.240
And there's a lot of people out there that need one.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.520
And that's why I was saying the narrative needs to change

25:03.520 --> 25:06.360
and be presented differently.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.800
That if exposure

25:09.640 --> 25:14.680
is already going to be a big factor in making change.

25:15.480 --> 25:18.520
I know we're getting a little away from the topic

25:18.520 --> 25:20.920
that it's kind of started this whole thing, however.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.320
And I want to point this out, just like when we went on a rant

25:23.320 --> 25:24.680
on our 20th anniversary episode

25:24.680 --> 25:26.960
about what was happening to women's rights, this country and everything.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.200
I want to I want to make this very clear.

25:29.200 --> 25:32.280
Does this relate to gaming? 100 percent? Absolutely.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.120
Yes, it does. Because remember, we don't just talk about video games,

25:35.280 --> 25:37.560
gaming news and gaming culture. And this.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.560
Mentality.

25:41.120 --> 25:46.440
Has a cycle of infecting gaming culture regularly.

25:47.680 --> 25:51.000
Mm hmm. And it needs to stop it all the time.

25:51.040 --> 25:53.040
I dealt with it today on freaking Twitter.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.560
It's just. Yeah.

25:54.560 --> 25:59.520
So if you if you feel we dedicated too much time to this topic, too bad,

25:59.520 --> 26:03.200
because we waste too much time reading this bullshit on social media

26:03.520 --> 26:05.480
all of the time and it needs to stop.

26:06.960 --> 26:11.040
On that note, let's talk about the types of games

26:11.040 --> 26:15.160
that we've been playing this week, what games we're drowning our sorrows in.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.280
No, I mean, honestly, yes, that that story pissed me off.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.080
But otherwise, you know what?

26:20.080 --> 26:22.200
I'm not going to let some bitch bring me down.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.360
I had a good week.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.240
I'm going to continue to have a great month.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.800
I'm thriving. Those people are idiots.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.520
I don't care. So moving on.

26:30.520 --> 26:31.920
How was your gaming week?

26:31.920 --> 26:34.480
How are you thriving in video games this week?

26:34.640 --> 26:36.800
How are you making somebody mad?

26:36.800 --> 26:40.720
Dark Sakura, by being a woman daring to play video games

26:40.720 --> 26:43.240
on her own terms, this mostly woman.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.440
Well, OK, yes.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.560
I I played a bunch of Dead by Daylight.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.480
I played with Finara.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.560
I actually went back and played a little bit of Killer

26:53.560 --> 26:55.960
and I ended up just making it like a fun farming match

26:55.960 --> 26:58.120
because of all the stinky other killers that have been around.

26:58.920 --> 27:02.360
So I did like that, you know, the doctor thing

27:02.360 --> 27:05.200
where you have to shock four people and then you're good.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.320
Like the daily.

27:06.320 --> 27:10.120
I did that and then I went around and making them drop pallets on me

27:10.120 --> 27:13.920
so I could bust those pallets and finish the pallet breaking challenge as well.

27:14.400 --> 27:18.560
And, you know, it was just I tried to be like non stinky.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.800
I don't care if I quote lose.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.560
I don't play for my level.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.600
I don't play for points.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.680
I don't play to win a play to have fun.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.400
And a lot of killers out there have been assholes

27:28.400 --> 27:32.640
and just not letting people have fun or ending the game too quickly

27:32.960 --> 27:35.400
or camping and tunneling people out.

27:35.400 --> 27:40.480
And I'm I went in to play just to to have fun,

27:40.480 --> 27:45.240
just to be silly, just to let other people have a break from the garbage,

27:45.680 --> 27:48.320
you know, and then get blood points for it.

27:49.320 --> 27:53.040
Um, and and I also played with

27:53.400 --> 27:56.440
Franklish eight, who's another streamer who.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.760
We had a lot of fun. It was just really random.

28:01.760 --> 28:04.760
I kind of was like not in the mood to play Final Fantasy.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.240
So we started Final Fantasy four and then we went and played.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.720
That was really fun.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.040
And I got to play with intoxicated.

28:12.240 --> 28:16.160
And walking disaster, few streamers, really fun people.

28:16.720 --> 28:22.120
Um, and then, um, last Sunday, I did buy Cult of the Lamb

28:22.120 --> 28:23.440
and I've got it all set up.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.640
I just need to install the extension for for Twitch.

28:27.320 --> 28:33.000
And, um, I also played a little bit more hooked on you.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.480
But for some reason, it didn't record that I had the hours on it.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.640
So it must be like a glitch on Twitch or something.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.120
Actually, it would be in my Windows partition.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.240
Um, I did, I did.

28:46.280 --> 28:50.880
Oh, I'm playing word scapes that I hit over level 100,000.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.040
I think it is.

28:52.960 --> 28:57.680
Hold on, maybe level 10,000, but I played a lot of it

28:57.880 --> 29:00.440
and I enjoy that stupid little game.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.280
It's a lot of fun.

29:01.840 --> 29:06.800
Um, I am also, I think right now, a fourth place in tournament mode.

29:07.560 --> 29:12.840
OK, I'm on one on ten thousand three hundred and forty nine that level.

29:14.120 --> 29:20.720
Um, I am also playing Final Fantasy four.

29:21.520 --> 29:29.600
Um, I, uh, Cecil has just become a paladin and we're going to rescue, uh, Rosa.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.880
And I'm, I'm having a lot of fun with that too.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.040
Um, I got, uh, Palom and Porom.

29:39.920 --> 29:40.760
Oh, I love them.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.080
The brat kids.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.000
Yeah, I love them.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.520
Uh, well, only one of them is really a brat.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.760
The other one's a little too nice, but I love the thwap.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.720
I forgot about the thwapping on the head.

29:51.080 --> 29:56.040
Every time, uh, uh, Porom says something rude, Palom comes over and goes,

29:56.160 --> 29:58.840
Thwap, and you hear the pop noise in the game.

29:58.840 --> 29:59.840
I had forgotten about that.

30:00.520 --> 30:05.880
Um, and, uh, now the thing is I'm playing a translation from the

30:05.880 --> 30:10.400
Japanese version with no censorship, like the uncensored sprites and everything.

30:10.840 --> 30:14.120
So I, I missed the spoonie Bard line.

30:14.480 --> 30:18.560
The line that he said was like, you son of a bitch, you know, which is

30:18.560 --> 30:19.800
probably a little bit more accurate.

30:19.800 --> 30:24.280
And it talks like more about people dying and, and, you know, mass

30:24.280 --> 30:25.960
attacks and burying their dead.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.480
It's, it's definitely a lot more gritty.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.760
Um, but it's still, I still love the game.

30:32.320 --> 30:38.600
Um, and I'm considering final fantasy five next, either that or maybe star ocean.

30:39.120 --> 30:39.480
Okay.

30:40.160 --> 30:40.520
Yeah.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.120
Um, but we'll see.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.400
And yeah.

30:43.760 --> 30:44.080
All right.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.400
Uh, let's go over to Loki.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.240
Talk about your gaming week.

30:47.240 --> 30:47.600
Loki.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.040
Um, still my craft.

30:50.080 --> 30:53.960
Uh, we did do a live stream though yesterday, so that was cool.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.520
I got to participate that.

30:55.560 --> 30:58.960
So we did a stream day, uh, for the whole channel 64 server.

30:59.320 --> 31:03.840
And we were streaming, I think like almost 14 hours.

31:04.120 --> 31:04.840
Wow.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.000
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.320
We had like about, I think eight people participate.

31:08.800 --> 31:09.880
So that was pretty nice.

31:09.880 --> 31:11.200
We each had like a two hour block.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.320
It was fun.

31:12.640 --> 31:18.200
You know, I launched pillagers in the space with a flying machine and I, uh, what

31:18.200 --> 31:18.440
else?

31:18.440 --> 31:19.400
Oh, just.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.480
Messed around on the server a little bit.

31:22.760 --> 31:25.600
Um, didn't really have too much, uh, planned out.

31:25.640 --> 31:29.400
Although this week I may want to stream again.

31:29.880 --> 31:33.240
Um, because St Rose coming out.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.160
Yeah, big deal.

31:35.640 --> 31:42.080
And also, uh, you know, arcade paradise, the game that's playing behind me, um, is

31:42.080 --> 31:43.960
another game that I want to check out as well.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.080
It looks pretty cool.

31:45.400 --> 31:49.760
It's like a SIM game where you're running a laundromat that you're, I think trying to

31:49.760 --> 31:51.120
convert over to an arcade.

31:51.160 --> 31:51.480
Yeah.

31:51.840 --> 31:52.920
Um, so it's pretty cool.

31:53.760 --> 31:54.200
Nice.

31:54.680 --> 31:55.040
All right.

31:55.440 --> 32:00.160
Um, my game a week, a lot of the usual stuff still dead by daylight, Final Fantasy 14,

32:00.160 --> 32:01.040
really excited.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.720
Uh, we get a patch very soon for Final Fantasy 14.

32:03.720 --> 32:04.720
So I'm excited for that.

32:05.240 --> 32:09.360
Um, I actually played some other random stuff this week, the outside of my norm.

32:09.360 --> 32:14.640
So, um, uh, Alan has been recently kind of into pinball games again on the PC he was

32:14.640 --> 32:15.000
playing.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.880
I just, I was watching over his shoulder.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.760
He was playing the, um, which collection was it?

32:19.800 --> 32:22.440
Not, not pinball FX, but the other one.

32:22.760 --> 32:28.840
Um, of course the name, uh, no, cause that's where pinball FX started was in pinball.

32:28.840 --> 32:32.240
It's the other companies like arcade treasures, pinball arcade.

32:32.360 --> 32:33.000
Thank you, Bobby.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.000
It's pinball arcade.

32:34.240 --> 32:37.760
So pinball arcade had all the Williams licenses in it.

32:37.760 --> 32:42.520
So I was watching him playing the Elvira tables that he bought a long time ago in that, um,

32:42.760 --> 32:43.400
collection.

32:43.720 --> 32:47.800
But you know, a few years ago, I think it was like 2018, the licenses moved.

32:47.880 --> 32:51.320
So he's still playing in the old one because of course once you buy it, they can't take it away from you.

32:51.320 --> 32:52.240
So you still play it there.

32:52.240 --> 32:56.880
But now pinball FX has a lot of those like Bally midway table licenses.

32:57.320 --> 33:03.800
So, um, it actually kind of made me go, Oh, I kind of want to check out, like, I forgot pinball FX, like was supposed to be having a new

33:03.800 --> 33:06.200
version because I was like, whatever happened to that series?

33:06.200 --> 33:08.800
They have pinball FX three, and then I haven't heard anything since then.

33:08.800 --> 33:15.400
Well, they're rebooting basically into pinball FX and it is out in early release on the Epic game store.

33:15.680 --> 33:23.480
Um, and I believe it's going to come out steam and the other platforms to, uh, uh, the consoles when it actually releases.

33:23.520 --> 33:24.280
Don't quote me on that.

33:24.280 --> 33:28.400
I can't remember if the steam part is, um, but it is a free to play.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.400
Um, Oh, thank you, Bob.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.560
Bobby says steam will be a year after Epic game store.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.400
Well, I think it started in like June or something.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.480
So I downloaded it to check it out.

33:36.480 --> 33:42.040
And, uh, the, the kind of unfortunate part is that they don't have all of the tables moved over yet.

33:42.360 --> 33:50.400
Um, and, and they're like, for example, those Elvira tables, uh, that Alan has, you can't get those in the new pinball FX.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.480
I don't think they were ever in pinball FX three either.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.440
So there are some licensed tables in there.

33:54.440 --> 34:01.680
In fact, there's quite a few, I shouldn't even say some, um, but you can't get the vast amount of library that the other games had built up.

34:01.680 --> 34:07.400
And they're having to redo it basically from where they were at and pinball FX three, because this is an all new engine.

34:07.400 --> 34:11.720
I believe it's capable of four K and does Ray tracing and all this other stuff.

34:11.720 --> 34:16.080
And yeah, Bobby's talking about how your purchases actually don't transfer over from FX three.

34:16.320 --> 34:21.800
So they're kind of committing to supporting both, but it isn't, it is an odd reboot for the series.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.200
But here, here's the, I know I can see why they're doing it.

34:24.200 --> 34:39.320
They're doing it because another model now that they have in here is a subscription where you can subscribe and get all the tables or most of them for a low, low monthly price to, uh, so, uh, I'm sure that's one big reason they want to move that direction.

34:39.520 --> 34:46.160
And, uh, everything is like you buy tickets and then use tickets to buy the tables and this type of thing, but they do have free tables.

34:46.160 --> 34:53.640
So like one of my favorite pinball tables, the Arabian nights table happened to be the free one on Friday or Saturday.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.600
So I was able to play it and check it out a little bit.

34:55.600 --> 34:56.960
And I had played another one too.

34:56.960 --> 35:00.480
There was a space, I think it was called space station or something as a pinball table.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.280
There was a free game at some point as well.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.440
So I was checking those out.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.280
So it is nice that they rotate through a couple of free tables.

35:06.280 --> 35:07.640
So you can really kind of check it out.

35:07.880 --> 35:16.200
Um, it also, I guess part of what they've done with pinball FX is like, now you have a pinball room that you can, uh, you know, collect things and build out in.

35:16.440 --> 35:21.080
Yeah, it's one of those, but I, I didn't understand how to use it.

35:21.080 --> 35:24.640
And I don't know if that's just because I didn't really pay any money for anything yet.

35:24.680 --> 35:27.120
Uh, it didn't really seem that intuitive to use.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.840
I could like change the carpet.

35:28.840 --> 35:32.960
And that was about, I don't know, it doesn't, I didn't really have a lot to do with it, but whatever.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.840
It's really about the pinball at the end of the day.

35:35.120 --> 35:39.960
Um, it looks nice, uh, very nice resolution, very crisp, but it's just kind of a bummer.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.080
It's like they have to rebuild the whole thing.

35:42.080 --> 35:47.920
Um, Bobby Blackwell says they did release the Indiana Jones table on FX three.

35:47.920 --> 35:48.080
Yeah.

35:48.080 --> 35:51.680
And it's $15 if you want that table on a pinball effects.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.160
So I'm, but I imagine Harris's Ford Harrison Ford's likeness probably isn't cheap.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.520
So it is what it is.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.000
One of those for a little bit.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.320
And then we, I think we sold it to get a different table.

36:04.440 --> 36:04.720
Yeah.

36:05.280 --> 36:08.280
So anyway, I mean, to, to get, download it for free.

36:08.320 --> 36:08.760
Sure.

36:08.760 --> 36:09.520
And check it out.

36:09.520 --> 36:09.760
Sure.

36:09.760 --> 36:10.640
It was, it was cute.

36:10.640 --> 36:11.160
It was fun.

36:11.680 --> 36:15.080
I don't know if I'll be buying any tables anytime real soon, but I'll keep an eye.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.560
I'll keep an eye on what they're offering in there.

36:16.560 --> 36:22.560
They had, is it bride of pin bot was what they, they didn't have regular pin bot, but they had bride of pin bot, which I thought was interesting.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.360
So, all right.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.280
Um, let's see other games I played this week.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.200
So I randomly played Mario Kart eight.

36:28.240 --> 36:29.760
I was, uh, out last night.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.480
I ended up going out to San Francisco last night.

36:31.480 --> 36:39.120
I was hanging out with listener and participant JD, uh, you know, goes way back with the show and the, the, the Monty days and all that stuff.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.920
And we were playing Mario Kart eight last night.

36:40.920 --> 36:42.720
So I finally got to see all these extra tracks.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.040
I just hadn't gotten around to playing yet.

36:44.040 --> 36:49.760
So we did some races on Waluigi pinball and the, the, um, Calamari desert.

36:49.760 --> 36:57.960
Is that what it's called for the N64, the one with the train, uh, plot twist, the last lap forces you to go on the train tracks.

36:57.960 --> 37:03.000
I remember that was the thing you could do on the N64, but now like, that's the, the last lap.

37:03.040 --> 37:06.760
You have to drive down the train tracks, which is a very interesting, yeah.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.160
They, they made some cool changes like that.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.560
Sorry, spoiler alert.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.000
But that track has been out for a few weeks.

37:11.000 --> 37:11.640
I got to play those.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.320
Like we have the DLC for it.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.920
I don't think I've updated it though.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.280
Yeah, you should check it out.

37:16.280 --> 37:16.760
They're good.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.280
Uh, so yeah, I had fun with that.

37:18.480 --> 37:29.600
And then random, we went into the classic super Nintendo library and we were playing paddle DePone last night over the weird thing is, so you have to still do it through the internet.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.120
We couldn't just connect to each other cause we were in the same room.

37:32.320 --> 37:37.480
We had to do it through the internet, but we were able to play, um, paddle DePone, which is basically it's Tetris attack.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.400
It's Pokemon puzzle league, but on the super Nintendo.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.800
We were playing that against each other.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.160
He, he would be in that though.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.520
I, I have, I'm out of practice.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.520
I haven't played in a long time.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.960
So that was, uh, yeah, so, but that was fun.

37:47.960 --> 37:51.400
So I got to play some stuff that is a little outside of my norm for gaming week.

37:51.400 --> 38:01.320
So, uh, hoping to continue that trend as we move on throughout the week and, uh, get into, uh, closer and closer to dragon con is coming up real soon.

38:01.600 --> 38:05.480
Um, I should talk a little bit here about dragon con and what's going on there.

38:05.560 --> 38:11.240
So, uh, we will not be here in two weeks, um, because dragon con is happening that weekend.

38:11.240 --> 38:28.000
And as the case has been for, I want to say the last 10 years now, I mean, I don't know if, I don't think we get to count the year that the pandemic happened and it was all virtual, but otherwise for like the past 10 years, cause 2012 was my first year I've been heading out to dragon con every labor day weekend.

38:28.360 --> 38:33.440
So, uh, this year I'm going out again and the app was updated this week.

38:33.480 --> 38:35.960
So I can tell you about my schedule.

38:36.080 --> 38:43.440
So, uh, here's where I'm going to be appearing at dragon con Friday at one o'clock, uh, diversity in video games.

38:43.440 --> 38:44.880
Why representation matters.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.760
I'll be moderating that panel, uh, for the video game track.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.760
Uh, I did a similar one last year and it was a great discussion.

38:50.760 --> 38:51.640
So I'm excited about that.

38:51.920 --> 39:02.640
Uh, two 30 on Friday, thriving on streaming media after 40, I couldn't fit the full name on my little flyer, but it's how do you do fellow kids thriving on streaming media after 40.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.680
So that's, uh, that's the, that's the name of that panel.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.840
I'm going to be on that with Bobby black Wolf.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.520
Um, and, uh, but he's only 29.

39:11.520 --> 39:12.600
That doesn't seem right.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.320
I, I think he snuck his way onto it.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.640
Like a lot of these kids do.

39:16.640 --> 39:20.160
So, um, everyone's always trying to be an adult.

39:20.160 --> 39:23.760
There's some other famous podcasts, like legit famous podcasting face.

39:23.760 --> 39:30.080
So there, I don't follow a lot of this, this stuff, but the, the macro brothers are on this panel.

39:30.080 --> 39:32.920
So am I have friends that listen to them and really enjoy them?

39:33.360 --> 39:41.880
Um, so, uh, apparently it's, it's, it's a big deal and I know that I know they have a lot of fans, so that's, that's going to be a, certainly a sold out wall to wall type of thing.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.280
Uh, so that'll be exciting.

39:43.800 --> 39:51.600
Uh, let's see also, uh, uh, on the agenda, um, we have on a Saturday at two 30.

39:51.600 --> 39:52.680
Oh, Bobby points out too.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.680
He's the moderator of that panel.

39:54.680 --> 39:56.720
So maybe he doesn't have to be 40 to moderate it.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.000
I guess that's, that's the deal.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.600
Maybe a Saturday at two 30, this is new for me.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.880
Uh, I'll be making my first appearance on the horror track.

40:05.960 --> 40:10.000
Uh, and that's something I've been kind of hinting at for a couple of weeks that I'm doing something new this year.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
And I'm really excited.

40:11.280 --> 40:20.320
Um, a lot of, you know, that, um, outside of doing, you know, video game commenting and broadcasting and all that stuff, um, I do stuff with a horror hosting and I've, I've done some stuff here locally.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.160
We did a great lost boys tribute with some of the stars in the movie.

40:23.360 --> 40:26.320
We did a twin peaks event in January with some of the stars.

40:26.480 --> 40:32.680
So I've been getting to, to do more and more of that and kind of, you know, learning about what I do and I don't love in the genre.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.920
And so, um, this is great.

40:33.920 --> 40:37.880
And I'm really excited for this opportunity to be a panelist on this panel horror.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.600
Why does it get no respect?

40:39.640 --> 40:41.760
And, uh, we'll, we'll talk a little bit about that.

40:41.960 --> 40:44.400
Uh, cause you know, I have some unique insight on that.

40:44.400 --> 40:50.280
So, um, and uh, yeah, it was Tony Collette robbed of an Oscar for, um, hereditary.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.640
Yes, of course she was.

40:51.640 --> 41:06.080
But you know, that's because people don't hold a horror up in the same, uh, calibers, a lot of other movies often, but anyway, uh, also on Saturday surviving the evolution of podcasting to video over on the digital media track.

41:06.240 --> 41:10.080
This is a topic that, you know, we've been talking about for a little while.

41:10.120 --> 41:12.680
Um, so I'm excited to participate in this discussion again.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.520
Obviously I have some things to say about it.

41:15.400 --> 41:24.480
Sunday at one o'clock, I'm moderating a discussion with some, um, uh, folks in the industry on ask the experts microtransactions in gaming.

41:24.680 --> 41:27.680
So it's one of those microtransactions are here to stay.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.200
What's the good, the bad, and the ugly of all that stuff.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.600
So we'll get into that.

41:32.040 --> 41:35.960
And then Monday at 1130 AM, this one's a ballroom panel.

41:35.960 --> 41:36.800
This is a pretty big deal.

41:36.800 --> 41:43.200
The voice actors from Red Dead Redemption one and two, we have four voice actors from the games that are going to be there.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.640
And we're doing a ballroom panel on Monday.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.200
Here's the interesting thing though.

41:46.400 --> 41:51.080
They're actually running this panel Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.

41:51.080 --> 41:57.840
It's, it's basically the big stars for Dragon cons video game track this year, as far as I know, I don't know, but they're running that panel.

41:58.000 --> 42:04.520
So I'm, I'm a little bit like, okay, by Monday, I think they're going to have been asked a lot of questions, so we'll, we'll see.

42:04.520 --> 42:07.000
It's going to be an interesting, and Monday is like 1130.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.840
That's the time everyone's checking out of the hotel.

42:09.920 --> 42:14.120
So it's going to be interesting to see who shows up and what they have to ask.

42:14.120 --> 42:21.320
I probably a lot of locals don't have to worry about the hotel checkout game, but I'm very excited for the opportunity and to meet the people.

42:21.920 --> 42:22.840
That'll be a lot of fun.

42:22.920 --> 42:25.480
So yeah, three tracks this year.

42:25.480 --> 42:26.560
I'm really excited about it.

42:26.560 --> 42:30.360
And I'll look forward to seeing some of you Dragon Con Labor Day weekend.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.120
I've been getting a question online a lot.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.520
Will the panels be streamed?

42:33.760 --> 42:40.520
The only one that I know of that is streamed is that, um, how do you do fellow kids, uh, thriving over 40?

42:40.800 --> 42:47.360
Uh, that panel will be on Dragon cons, uh, digital media, um, Twitch that's DC digital media.

42:47.480 --> 42:56.520
If you want to follow that, the other panels, unfortunately, I don't know if they're straddle think they are, they may be recorded for future use, but I don't want to guarantee anything.

42:56.720 --> 43:01.440
I, one of them may be on Dragon con TV subscription service, but I don't want to guarantee that either.

43:01.640 --> 43:12.720
Um, so honestly, I think Dragon con would just prefer if you really want to see the panels that bad come out, but, uh, to be fair, there's a lot of hesitations still around COVID understandably.

43:12.720 --> 43:15.360
So they have tried to up their virtual offerings.

43:15.360 --> 43:18.880
I will say a lot more is online than you would have found a couple of years ago.

43:18.880 --> 43:19.640
So there is that.

43:20.280 --> 43:20.680
Okay.

43:21.600 --> 43:25.000
Uh, SG100 Matt says, I'm excited for both Rob and Bobby.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.280
You're on some fun panels.

43:26.280 --> 43:26.680
Yeah.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.040
Um, uh, we're excited.

43:28.080 --> 43:31.120
We've be very, uh, very, very fun.

43:31.600 --> 43:36.280
Um, all right, let's get into some more gaming news for the week.

43:36.280 --> 43:39.720
I'm going to kick it over to Loki to start us off with some other gaming news.

43:40.880 --> 43:53.840
Uh, yeah, so, um, unfortunately we have more news to kind of tie into the story we talked about last week about allegations of sexual harassment at Nintendo of America.

43:54.240 --> 43:58.480
And this is coming now from, um, the testing side of that.

43:58.480 --> 44:12.280
So the game testers who are, you know, a lot of times contracted for Nintendo and stuff, um, have recounted lots of different scenarios where they've been sexually harassed.

44:12.280 --> 44:18.240
So they talked about, there was an article on Kotaku that kind of went into detail about it.

44:18.240 --> 44:28.000
Um, talking about like one of the testers who they're calling Hannah, who had, um, experiences that led her to quit her job.

44:28.040 --> 44:47.400
Um, basically saying it was supposed to be a lighthearted place, but then ended up that, um, there was a male translator that they were working with that started posting, um, you know, uh, memes and stuff about why, like, what's the best Pokemon to have sex with.

44:47.440 --> 44:52.560
And started making kind of like an, I mean, that's not, that's not necessarily work discussion.

44:52.640 --> 44:53.960
I would think most of the time.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.320
Uh, yeah, it's, uh, probably, yeah, just because it involves Pokemon does not make it appropriate for work.

45:00.040 --> 45:00.320
Yeah.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.120
And it started escalating from there.

45:02.160 --> 45:06.240
Um, you know, she said that it's, Nintendo was almost like a nightmare.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.960
It is sad because I love Nintendo.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.640
I grew up in Nintendo.

45:09.680 --> 45:15.400
I was so excited to join Nintendo when I first got there and thought it was, I was going to go somewhere.

45:15.640 --> 45:18.920
Um, I had my supervisors tell me I was doing such a great job.

45:19.680 --> 45:29.640
Um, but then of course, you know, there's been other, um, recounts of different things, you know, the common saying that they've really felt like a frat house sometimes.

45:29.840 --> 45:38.720
So kind of the whole just misogyny and just uncomfortable, you know, sexual comments and, you know,

45:39.680 --> 45:43.080
type tiger claw and chat says water cooler type of discussions.

45:43.200 --> 45:44.600
No, no, no.

45:44.640 --> 45:45.720
Inappropriate ones.

45:45.760 --> 45:50.880
A water cooler discussion would be, Hey, did you see who got kicked off the mass singer last night?

45:51.080 --> 45:55.480
That is an appropriate work, uh, discussion water cooler discussion.

45:55.760 --> 45:56.640
Uh, yeah.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.960
Would you rather fuck Pikachu or Jigglypuff?

45:58.960 --> 46:02.640
That's not an appropriate water cooler discussion, whether it was at the water cooler or not.

46:03.160 --> 46:03.360
Yeah.

46:03.360 --> 46:14.400
Then outside of the sexual comments, there was also, you know, the, your typical, um, you know, discrimination based on gender for like promotions and whatnot.

46:14.400 --> 46:20.280
So for example, one of the female contractors, uh, was trying to advance to the company.

46:20.680 --> 46:26.400
I applied for a bunch of other jobs in the industry and they would ask me why I was looking to leave Nintendo.

46:26.480 --> 46:29.280
I, I'm sorry, I know you're saying it the way it is.

46:29.280 --> 46:31.320
I know you are, but it's just one of those things.

46:31.400 --> 46:36.120
It was like, how disgusting is it that we have, this is just the typical discrimination you see in the industry.

46:36.120 --> 46:44.120
This is just the, here's our, you know, our, our, uh, uh, assembly line discrimination we have going on, uh, behind the scenes at the different companies.

46:44.120 --> 46:48.360
Like I just, I, I hate that we're here, but we're here.

46:48.360 --> 46:48.920
We've been here.

46:48.920 --> 46:49.680
We've been here.

46:50.440 --> 46:51.800
It sounds so familiar.

46:51.800 --> 46:56.680
It's like we talked about this dozens of times, just insert every company in here.

46:57.640 --> 47:05.480
There was one, uh, another tester, uh, Valerie Allison that, uh, said she would ask her managers how she would be promoted to a permanent position.

47:06.160 --> 47:17.720
And, um, basically that she felt pressure to become a full-time play because she needed to stay at Lincoln and says, uh, your chance to be converted to full-time was probably worse as a girl.

47:17.720 --> 47:24.600
She said, um, it's usually the guys who get promoted and they're all usually friends.

47:24.600 --> 47:26.040
They all watch super bowl together.

47:26.200 --> 47:29.320
As she went on to Matt and chat says, these are not isolated issues.

47:29.320 --> 47:31.960
This is an epidemic within the industry, a hundred percent.

47:31.960 --> 47:36.200
I wouldn't even say it's necessarily just this industry, even it's just true.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.880
This is just corporate.

47:37.880 --> 47:39.720
Um, but this is it.

47:39.720 --> 47:41.400
You notice what's happened here.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.400
We had one Nintendo story.

47:43.400 --> 47:52.040
Then we had a second Nintendo story and now the dam is starting to burst because now what you've just named three different women, at least so far in this.

47:52.040 --> 47:55.320
So now people are starting to realize, oh, it wasn't just me.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.000
This was an epidemic.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.720
I mean, it keeps saying that they're taking, going to take this seriously.

47:59.720 --> 48:00.120
All right.

48:00.120 --> 48:00.520
We'll see.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.600
Let's see what you do.

48:02.600 --> 48:07.880
Now, Nintendo has to acknowledge it because they have very clearly been trying to hide from it when it was one or two.

48:07.880 --> 48:12.920
And this is, this is now the first time where I believe Doug Bowser finally had to comment on it this week.

48:12.920 --> 48:20.520
Like somebody finally called him out on it, um, and asked him like, what the hell's the plan to, you know, stop this culture?

48:21.080 --> 48:24.760
Um, which I felt was a very non-answer answer.

48:25.560 --> 48:32.120
Um, let's, let's see, you know, but here's the thing at the end of the day, I'm not interested in his words.

48:32.680 --> 48:35.000
I'm not, I'm interested in the actions.

48:35.720 --> 48:39.880
So if Doug Bowser really wants to say something, say it with action.

48:40.920 --> 48:42.760
I could care less what his comment was on this.

48:43.960 --> 48:44.460
Yeah.

48:47.000 --> 48:47.880
Anyway, yeah.

48:48.840 --> 48:56.680
Basically, it's a, it's a very long article with lots of different examples of this, but like, honestly, like all of these examples, I could read every single one.

48:57.240 --> 49:06.840
It's all stuff we've heard before, you know, where it's like, you know, if, if a female come, like tries to stand up for herself, they're just gonna be called overly sensitive.

49:06.840 --> 49:15.960
If, you know, they try to advance in the company, they'll find excuses for why they can't without saying gender, you know, because obviously that's discriminatory.

49:15.960 --> 49:17.560
But they'll, they'll make excuses.

49:17.560 --> 49:21.640
Or I'm sure that compensation is probably more for the males than the females.

49:21.640 --> 49:24.600
It's, we've heard this so many times.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.480
And I wouldn't be surprised if it's not in every single company, at least large companies for sure.

49:31.480 --> 49:34.120
I mean, some of these smaller, like indie studios and stuff.

49:34.760 --> 49:38.440
I'm sure there's probably some, but like some of these, they're very small.

49:38.440 --> 49:50.280
I can't imagine that there's, you know, they're really small teams, but like definitely in these larger companies, it's easier to lose sight on kind of the details when you're working with hundreds of employees.

49:50.920 --> 49:59.720
And it's easy to have these folks in management just kind of off the rails without realizing it.

50:01.320 --> 50:08.040
All right, I'm going to move on and talk about a part of the industry that is growing and growing and growing.

50:08.120 --> 50:13.960
And that is the Embracer Group, who is starting to acquire quite a few holdings under their belt.

50:14.520 --> 50:19.880
You may recall they bought that part of Square Enix that Square Enix was desperate to get rid of.

50:19.880 --> 50:24.040
Like, oh, Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider is so bad.

50:24.040 --> 50:25.800
We have to get rid of it right now.

50:25.800 --> 50:30.360
Like, which I obviously I'm saying that very tongue in cheek because the Tomb Raider only wears one belt.

50:30.360 --> 50:31.480
This is ridiculous.

50:33.240 --> 50:34.920
Doesn't fit with our portfolio.

50:35.720 --> 50:39.320
Anyway, so Embracer is on a spree right now.

50:39.320 --> 50:41.560
One of the biggest things has been turning heads.

50:41.560 --> 50:51.480
They now own JRR, the rights basically to, well, they actually they bought Middle Earth Enterprises.

50:51.480 --> 50:56.360
That's the company that owns big screen and small screen rights to Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.

50:57.160 --> 51:01.400
So this could this mean that a Hobbit game is on the horizon?

51:01.400 --> 51:03.400
Probably going to be a long way out.

51:03.400 --> 51:07.880
But, you know, but that's also the fact that they have the screen rights as well.

51:07.880 --> 51:11.560
You know, this is what was used to make this 1978 animated film.

51:11.560 --> 51:14.440
Peter Jackson's movies, Amazon's upcoming thing.

51:14.440 --> 51:21.560
Oh, actually, Amazon's thing was a loophole because it excluded TV series of more than

51:21.560 --> 51:23.560
eight or eight episodes or something like that.

51:23.560 --> 51:26.440
There was some weird exclusion that they're kind of dancing around the rights with that.

51:26.440 --> 51:31.400
But anyway, so that's not all of it, though.

51:31.400 --> 51:34.680
Embracer also went and they bought more stuff as well.

51:35.560 --> 51:38.360
They also got limited run games.

51:38.360 --> 51:43.640
That's huge because they're doing a lot of those physical copy things of games and so forth.

51:43.640 --> 51:45.480
That was brought up this week as well.

51:46.040 --> 51:52.200
Tripwire Interactive, who made the games Killing 4 and Chivalry was that as well.

51:52.200 --> 51:56.200
Tuxedo Labs, who made Tear Down was a part of that as well.

51:56.200 --> 52:01.160
So, Embracer has been going through and buying all of these companies.

52:02.120 --> 52:07.560
Another one that they got as part of this, Tatsujin, the Japanese studio.

52:08.600 --> 52:13.480
The boss of Tatsujin is a co-founder of Tappelan, Mashihiro Yuge.

52:13.480 --> 52:15.640
That's the developers of Zero Wing.

52:16.680 --> 52:24.600
So, Toaplan has done a great many of awesome game, including, I want to say they did

52:26.200 --> 52:27.400
Truxton, didn't they?

52:29.400 --> 52:30.280
Yeah, Truxton.

52:30.280 --> 52:34.440
Because here's an interesting kind of the same week this story comes out.

52:35.320 --> 52:37.080
Fire and Fire Shark.

52:37.800 --> 52:41.720
Classic games from this publisher are coming out to the PC.

52:41.720 --> 52:48.600
Truxton, Twin Cobra, Out Zone, and Zero Wing, published and enhanced by Bitwave Games.

52:49.240 --> 52:52.760
I'm not sure these games were in high demand, but cool.

52:52.760 --> 52:55.720
People can now revisit one of the internet's first memes.

52:55.720 --> 52:59.880
Because, of course, I think most people know at this point that All Your Base Belong to

52:59.880 --> 53:03.400
Us, Move Every Zig, that's all from Zero Wing.

53:03.400 --> 53:06.040
And I imagine they're going to leave all that translation intact.

53:06.840 --> 53:09.480
But they are saying it's pixel perfect graphics.

53:09.480 --> 53:11.240
There's going to be a very easy mode.

53:11.240 --> 53:13.320
So, they're actually patching in a Bobby Black Wolf mode.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.840
That's very exciting.

53:14.840 --> 53:19.720
But yeah, all these games are coming to PC in 2022.

53:20.680 --> 53:21.180
Fun.

53:22.060 --> 53:27.580
Bobby Black Wolf giving us some insight to the Tripwire acquisition and tying this together

53:27.580 --> 53:28.940
to something else you all might have heard about.

53:29.660 --> 53:34.620
This is interesting because they made a statement that says the co-founder that had previously

53:34.620 --> 53:40.940
made the anti-abortion comments will be exploring opportunities outside of Tripwire.

53:40.940 --> 53:45.340
This was the only way Tripwire could remove that founder was by being bought.

53:45.340 --> 53:48.940
He stepped down as CEO, but still owned most of the company.

53:48.940 --> 53:51.820
You may recall that story from a little while ago.

53:51.820 --> 53:56.140
That was the same company where the CEO was making, you know, the anti-abortion statements

53:56.140 --> 53:59.340
that the folks that worked there didn't agree with.

53:59.340 --> 54:03.500
And, you know, so now how this has come full circle.

54:03.500 --> 54:07.340
They finally got rid of them or are going to get rid of them through this purchase.

54:07.900 --> 54:08.540
Interesting.

54:09.260 --> 54:12.300
So, let's see.

54:12.860 --> 54:16.620
DarkTucionChat says, I found the developer on one of the other discords I hang out in.

54:16.620 --> 54:18.780
Actually, these are the arcade ports.

54:18.780 --> 54:20.540
Oh, I didn't realize that.

54:20.540 --> 54:25.020
So that all your bases will not be present because that was in the console port.

54:25.020 --> 54:26.140
So these are arcade ports.

54:26.140 --> 54:26.860
Oh, that's too bad.

54:27.500 --> 54:31.820
You'd think you'd think they're going to have a mode where you can change the dialogue.

54:31.820 --> 54:32.940
That would be very upsetting.

54:32.940 --> 54:36.620
I'm sure that a game that exists on PC can be modded.

54:36.620 --> 54:40.860
Yeah, if this week has taught us anything dialogue, quote unquote.

54:40.860 --> 54:41.660
Yeah, that's true.

54:41.660 --> 54:45.340
If this week has taught us anything, there will be a dialogue fix patch for this game.

54:45.340 --> 54:45.900
Absolutely.

54:46.780 --> 54:49.980
As shown on a Mat and Chat wonders, I'm kind of interested what they will do with limited

54:49.980 --> 54:50.860
run games.

54:50.860 --> 54:52.780
Seems like they're keeping everyone there intact.

54:52.780 --> 54:54.940
I wonder if there will be a straight cash infusion.

54:55.740 --> 54:58.060
Possibly this could be a good thing for them.

54:58.060 --> 55:01.340
I've heard that limited run games can be kind of slow sometimes.

55:01.340 --> 55:05.580
So maybe a little injection of cash to help them deliver on things a little faster could

55:05.580 --> 55:08.060
be cool if we're assuming that they're not completely evil.

55:08.940 --> 55:11.420
That's the big assumption with the corporation.

55:11.420 --> 55:11.660
True.

55:12.540 --> 55:18.940
Remember that they have a giant game archive now that they purchased as well.

55:18.940 --> 55:20.620
Oh, yeah, that's true.

55:20.620 --> 55:21.020
Yeah.

55:21.020 --> 55:25.020
So perhaps some of that could play into this as well.

55:25.020 --> 55:25.820
Interesting.

55:25.820 --> 55:26.320
All right.

55:27.580 --> 55:34.700
Well, we'll see what continues as Embracer is becoming quite the Voltron in the industry.

55:34.700 --> 55:40.620
As I've heard Bobby refer to him on his show, the 10 cent of Europe is building strongly

55:40.620 --> 55:41.020
over there.

55:41.900 --> 55:42.460
All right.

55:42.460 --> 55:44.620
In the meantime, let's move on to another story.

55:44.620 --> 55:45.260
Dark Sakura.

55:46.860 --> 55:51.660
So developers are not beyond being assholes.

55:52.460 --> 55:56.780
In fact, we know a good many in the industry are assholes as we've just covered.

55:58.060 --> 56:02.620
But it's not just the big names.

56:02.620 --> 56:05.420
We have some from some of the indie developers as well.

56:06.860 --> 56:09.820
So Dolphin Barn Incorporated.

56:10.220 --> 56:14.140
They've already gotten into Hot Water.

56:16.540 --> 56:21.740
They were talking, you know, they already put in some anti-mask rhetoric in one of their

56:21.740 --> 56:23.660
patch notes for one of their games.

56:25.420 --> 56:35.580
And basically, they have been sending abusive messages when they've banned players from

56:35.580 --> 56:36.140
their hub.

56:37.020 --> 56:46.060
And they were warned once saying that when posting any content in the community or communicating

56:46.060 --> 56:49.340
with players, please make sure it adheres to the guidelines.

56:51.580 --> 57:00.460
But now they've been responding to negative reviews on Steam in a very abusive manner.

57:01.260 --> 57:06.140
And so they also added, Steam did, we also want to make it clear that you should not

57:06.140 --> 57:10.380
reverse the moderator decisions or enable rule violations on your hub.

57:10.380 --> 57:15.340
Future disregard for our rules and guidelines could jeopardize our business relationship.

57:16.060 --> 57:21.180
So they are banned from their own game community.

57:23.500 --> 57:28.380
And this isn't the only time you like I said, they had the anti-mask rhetoric.

57:28.460 --> 57:35.420
They also, May last year, they added a note about combat in a game that says, weak men

57:35.420 --> 57:36.620
lack character.

57:41.500 --> 57:44.380
It's really disgusting.

57:44.380 --> 57:47.500
So yeah, they're banned from their own game.

57:47.500 --> 57:50.700
You kind of have to love the punchline there, though.

57:50.700 --> 57:56.140
Like you're so you're such an asshole, you got banned from a store that sells your game.

57:56.220 --> 57:58.620
You got banned from a store that sells your game.

57:58.620 --> 58:00.700
It's wild.

58:01.500 --> 58:07.100
Yeah, they honestly, they shouldn't, I think, be allowed to post to Steam anymore.

58:08.300 --> 58:12.140
Yeah, because I mean, honestly, they're still making money off this game.

58:12.140 --> 58:13.260
So whatever.

58:15.260 --> 58:18.140
I don't usually support piracy, but all right.

58:19.740 --> 58:23.100
Anyway, don't even don't even support their game through piracy.

58:23.100 --> 58:24.380
Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.

58:25.260 --> 58:27.100
Just their game shouldn't be touched.

58:28.060 --> 58:29.900
Even acknowledging it here is dirty.

58:29.900 --> 58:33.100
But you still have to like, this doesn't happen every day.

58:33.100 --> 58:33.980
We're developers.

58:33.980 --> 58:37.660
So yeah, you just have it every day where a developer is so toxic, they get banned from

58:37.660 --> 58:38.460
their own forum.

58:38.460 --> 58:39.900
It does make for a great headline.

58:40.860 --> 58:41.420
All right.

58:41.420 --> 58:45.180
Fifth Dream in chat says, why are these men so interested in whether other men live up

58:45.180 --> 58:46.860
to their man standards?

58:46.860 --> 58:50.780
Great question, because these are the same men, as I was saying earlier, that are like,

58:50.780 --> 58:52.940
you could be gay, just don't hit on me.

58:55.020 --> 59:02.380
Math, puzzle figures floating around the screen right now, because I don't understand.

59:04.300 --> 59:07.420
They should just have their fingers and tongues cut out or something.

59:10.220 --> 59:15.180
Metaphorically, of course, because we would never advocate violence here on Twitch television.

59:15.180 --> 59:16.220
I wouldn't ever.

59:17.580 --> 59:22.380
Moving on, let's talk about something else that should be banned from Steam.

59:22.380 --> 59:23.740
I think it actually already is.

59:23.740 --> 59:25.980
But Loki, please give us some insight.

59:25.980 --> 59:27.740
Hey, I don't think it's ever going to be on.

59:28.300 --> 59:29.260
I don't even know if.

59:29.260 --> 59:30.860
Oh, I guess it did make it on Steam.

59:30.860 --> 59:33.500
But yeah, I thought these games are banned from Steam.

59:33.500 --> 59:34.620
But what do I know?

59:35.420 --> 59:41.740
Yeah, so anyways, a game called Untamed Isles, who was kind of like a Pokemon game.

59:41.740 --> 59:44.380
But then but then, you know, what makes Pokemon better?

59:44.380 --> 59:47.100
Let's throw some crypto stuff in there as well.

59:47.100 --> 59:48.780
NFTs, you know, love that.

59:49.740 --> 59:53.100
So it raised half a million dollars on Kickstarter.

59:53.660 --> 59:56.940
And that was a year ago.

59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.700
And now it can't even make its money back.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:04.300
They had posted an update on the game's Steam page

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:08.380
saying that we had to pause development of Untamed Isles and put the project on hold.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:14.700
There have been a myriad of factors that have caused the lead up to this very moment.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.740
But what all comes down to is we're finally unable to

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:21.260
financially keep up with the demands that we set out to do.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:26.060
Basically, the crypto market is crashed.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:31.900
And so they we leaned into the crypto market and expanded rapidly off the back of the positive

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:32.380
interest.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:37.100
And when the crash came, we ended up heavily exposed with too short of a runway.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:41.340
So basically, they took all your money that that you invested in the game.

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.780
They put it in the crypto market thinking, hey, double or nothing, right?

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.420
Well, nothing.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.740
They still need to be responsible for for paying back the money.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.340
Well, these are due to our cash reserves being empty.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.900
We're not in a position to refund our initial backers.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:04.620
We're sorry, but hey, I mean, technically, Kickstarter is just supporting the company

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.060
and not getting a product.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:11.020
So, you know, by unfortunately, this happens often on Kickstarter, which is why I stopped

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:14.300
contributing kickstarters and why we don't have guests on the show anymore promoting

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.100
kickstarters.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:20.380
It's just sorry, but it's there's just too many of these types of stories, not the crypto

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.660
thing necessarily, but just kickstarters that aren't able to follow through on their promises

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.780
where it's just like, I'm not interested in promoting that.

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:31.100
So yeah, unfortunately, a few bad apples have ruined it for everyone.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.540
That's the reality.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:36.700
So yeah.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:44.060
Well, I can't I can't believe this concept just didn't catch on like wild.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.620
So all right, let me move on.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.100
I want to talk about this.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.700
We kind of knew this was coming.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:54.380
I think we even kind of addressed it on a previous episode, but I will just quickly

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:56.940
say confirmed the arcade went up.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:01.180
NFL Blitz is coming back or seriously is coming out.

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:04.860
So NFL Blitz is coming back because an arcade went up is coming out.

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:09.180
So there are some issues that are going to be addressed in the game, though.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.980
So it's interesting to kind of hear about some of the things that the NFL and all the

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:19.500
rights holders and various things, one of them to do to fix up the game, such as violent

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:25.420
collisions that were gratuitous things after the play and that went unpenalized.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:29.420
So this is just the type of thing that has kind of aged bad in twenty five years.

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.740
So they've had to kind of scale that back a little bit.

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.460
You know, they wanted to still keep the spirit of the game, obviously.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:39.420
But it's kind of like I get it sounds like the timer to do those types of things has

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.180
been pulled back significantly.

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.300
So it's kind of interesting.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:46.540
And it sounds like they have a lot of the agreements to bring back old players in the

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.820
game, but you might not see them all.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:55.740
But you will get 1997 NFL Blitz, NFL Blitz 99 and NFL Blitz 2000 Gold Edition.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:00.700
And they actually had to go in and change some of the code to make it happen.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:03.020
So I think it'll be cool.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:12.140
I'm not like a super fan of this NFL Blitz series, but I know it's in the whole same

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:17.740
thing as like NBA Jam and, you know, kind of comes from that same era.

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:18.460
So, yeah.

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:24.860
S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, yeah, CTE isn't a joke and destroying players doesn't age

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:25.180
well.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:25.740
Yeah.

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:30.460
So in dark to see, it says a lot of people were passing on this because of the changes.

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.140
Of course they are.

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.140
Then more for the rest of us.

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:40.620
Zen Monkey says, what's the point of bringing it back if they just have to make it like

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:41.740
every other football game?

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.060
Boo.

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.780
Make the teams robots and do your own thing, Blitz.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.300
You don't need the NFL.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:51.740
Well, that is that is a I was going to say, you know, but the idea of making them robots

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.780
or androids.

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:53.580
Interesting.

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:58.380
But I guess they wanted to err on the side of people would want to have at least some

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.580
of the players and so forth and still in the game.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:05.340
And in order to make that happen, they wanted to do some of these changes.

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:05.840
So.

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.900
No, Bobby Blackwell points out Mutant Football League does exist exactly for that purpose

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:12.380
pretty much.

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.420
That's a good point.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:13.920
So.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:17.100
All right, let's move on to some more stories.

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:17.740
Stark Sakura.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:23.820
So I know that a lot of people out there are big fans of Gran Turismo.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.660
I know my hubby is a big fan of Gran Turismo.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:38.220
And there is a car in Gran Turismo Sport that was designed by McLaren.

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:45.820
If you don't know what me and McLaren is, they've made some of like the best supercars,

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.580
you know, known to date.

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.580
I've got to drive a McLaren once.

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:50.140
It was great.

01:04:50.140 --> 01:05:01.100
There was a car that they put in that was a virtual concept that was called the McLaren

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.300
Solus GT.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:07.180
Well, McLaren now has manufactured the car.

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:07.980
It is.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.100
It's a real thing now.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:15.820
It is a 5.2 liter V10 engine, seven speed sequential shift.

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:20.300
It is pretty sleek.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:25.980
It kind of has that sort of almost detached front two wheels look.

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.940
It's a fairly light car.

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:39.260
It's all full carbon fiber body and titanium.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:44.860
And this thing would feel no pain around the track.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:51.020
It honestly, it's just so freaking pretty.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.580
It looks like the supercar.

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.060
I won't lie.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:02.460
Anyone have a, you know, a couple of mails?

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:06.540
A house in San Francisco to sell to help you afford that.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:12.780
No, it has a top speed of 322 kilometers an hour or 200 miles an hour.

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:27.340
And it has 650 Nm of torque and 1200 downforce at 150 miles an hour.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.820
It's pretty intense.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:36.620
This would be the thing that I would have watched on Top Gear.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:37.100
I'll be perfectly honest.

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.420
The question is which paint job do you like the best?

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:40.460
Oh.

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.300
I think the orange and blue looks great.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:47.420
The white and green makes me think of Jazz from Transformers.

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:50.380
Also a little black and orange is good.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.620
Squiggly is not following.

01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:53.820
I'm not feeling the squigglies.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:07:02.780
I really like the black with the, yeah.

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:03.740
Is it orange or red?

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.020
It looked like it was red to me.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.300
But it's also got a rainbow on it.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:08.940
That's awesome.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:15.020
But there's also this one that's like, uh, all black with gold detail on the tires.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.540
And I think that that's pretty sharp.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:22.860
That would be, that would be my jam without the numbers on it.

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:28.540
Cause I mean, the numbers are more for racing anyway, but not that, that would just be

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.140
pretty wicked, pretty wicked.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.540
I hit the button to feel the drive.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:36.780
Yeah.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:38.860
Number two is I think.

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.340
I like the orange and blue with the little rainbow in the back.

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.180
That's, that's a hot car.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:44.780
I really like that one for sure.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.660
But yeah, I'll never be able to afford it.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.820
So it's just something I can appreciate from a distance.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:56.460
I think that the whole thing is just a beautiful piece of machinery.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.620
I'm trying to figure out where the engine on it is.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.780
Is it a, is it, I think it's a rear engine.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.140
Oh, I'm sure.

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:10.620
Um, there was one that had a central engine and I don't remember whether it wasn't a McLaren,

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.780
but that thing was pretty interesting.

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.140
I'll quickly say something else to show.

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:17.580
And under Matt said in chat here saying coincidentally, the car costs as much in real

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:22.780
life as it costs in in-game currency and GT and a lifetime of saving and playing to afford.

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.020
Yes.

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:24.300
Yeah.

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:29.900
Um, I'm trying though to see, um,

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:33.420
I'm trying to, I guess it's a rear engine.

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:37.820
Um, uh, let's see, barrel throttle.

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:47.980
Oh, at any rate, at any rate, um, uh, it also apparently has like, uh, uh, oh, uh, the engine

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.620
is fixed, uh, to the chassis.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:51.820
There we go.

01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:53.020
Very interesting.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:53.500
Yeah.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:58.460
Um, this would definitely be on my list of dream cars, although I don't know if it's

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:03.020
on my list of dream cars, although I would still give somebody else's right arm for one

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.220
of the Bugatti Veyron's.

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.660
I love the way you phrase that.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.660
I'd give somebody else's right arm, not mine.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:10.300
Cause somebody else's.

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:11.740
In a heartbeat.

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.380
Here have, have this person's right arm.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.980
Here's a doll's right arm.

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:16.700
All right.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.220
Uh, let's move on.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.980
We're going to get to our next story.

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:24.620
Uh, Loki, this is fascinating to me because we're talking about a fandom for a game that's

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:25.420
not real.

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.780
Help, help explain this here, please.

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:27.580
It's like a meme.

01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:34.060
So it kind of reminds me a little bit of the free folk, um, which is the kind of the fan

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:39.660
community for a game of Thrones who turned on game of Thrones when season eight sucked.

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:47.820
Um, so it's kinda like that, but in a sense, uh, so what this is, it's about this game

01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:52.380
called Arkham world, uh, which is not a real game, obviously.

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:57.260
Cause the next, uh, game that they're doing is, I don't remember what it's called now,

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:01.260
but it's like with Robin and stuff and, um, it doesn't matter.

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.940
Uh, Oh, I'm sorry.

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.140
They're doing suicide squad.

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:05.420
Oh, there was also Gotham nights.

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.020
That was the one of the nights.

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:07.820
It's this pod culture.

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:08.620
Yeah.

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.420
Gotham nights.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:14.300
So Gotham nights, eh, it's kinda like, you know, not, not all that exciting.

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:19.100
So instead what the community is doing is they're talking about this like fictional

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.740
game as if it's real and it's already out.

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:25.660
Which is funny because like they keep posting all these like kind of memes or fake things

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:29.580
like talking about, like, you know, for those who haven't been, you know, keeping up with

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:35.260
like one year ago today, Batman Arkham world was released, you know, um, you know, what's,

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.540
what's your opinion about this game?

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.980
Or like they talked about, like, they keep like referencing stuff that happened in this

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:40.460
game.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.060
Um, that's not real.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.060
Like they'll have screenshots where, Hey, look, my favorite part of this game is Spider-Man

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.260
swinging in stuff like that.

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:53.900
It's kind of funny, like, um, a way to just talk about, you know, what they actually want

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:58.380
in the game, like a open world Arkham game versus what they're getting.

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:02.060
So has anyone streamed the game on Twitch yet?

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:02.860
That's what I want to see.

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:05.820
No, I don't think it's streaming.

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:08.060
Then somebody needs to take it to the next level.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:12.860
Like we just had that story, excuse me, two weeks ago of the people that made that entirely

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:17.260
fake near level, like into the church and everything you need to, you Arkham world fans

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.700
need to get on that level.

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.220
You need to, if you really want to gaslight everyone into thinking your game is real,

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.420
you need to get on that level.

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:29.020
Well, the thing too about it is like, it's kind of funny, like, I mean, it's sort of

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:36.060
like civil disobedience as well, because you're like, instead of talking about, I mean, obviously

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:42.780
if the subreddit's not owned by the folks developing these Arkham games, um, but typically

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:47.100
like a studio would probably want to promote their game within that community.

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:51.900
And so kind of like, well, we, we don't really, we're not interested in your stupid Gotham

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.140
night.

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:57.260
So we're going to just talk about this other game and just talk about all this hypothetical

01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:58.220
stuff that's going on.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.260
It's kind of funny.

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.380
It's not an original idea.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:04.220
Apparently, uh, one of the, the, uh, folks is sorry.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:09.420
Unhappy worker 77 said that it was something that happened in the Titanfall community with,

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.620
uh, Titanfall three, where they pretend that's a real thing as well.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.020
Yeah.

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:13.340
Yeah.

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.420
Which I wish it was a real thing.

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.180
Cause Titanfall two I hear is really good.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.860
Apex is still pretty good though.

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:25.900
As far as those giant robot and giant giant mech robot is what makes everything better.

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:26.540
Everything better.

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:27.980
All right.

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:31.420
Well, retro goodness always makes things better too.

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:36.940
And of course, a lot of people are very excited about the mini Genesis two, uh, the full list

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.300
of games came out.

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:44.140
So we know exactly what is going to be, uh, in the Japanese version and the U S version

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.820
of the Sega, uh, Genesis or mega drive mini two.

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.580
The only way you can get one of these in North America, by the way, is to get one from Amazon,

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:57.740
Japan, which I think is interesting, but because there are so few of them being made because

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:01.020
of, you know, components and parts and things like that, they basically only have the one

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:01.660
way to get it.

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:07.820
Now, this whole thing, and this announcement of the big game list kicked off quite the

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:09.580
discussion in our discord this week.

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:13.580
I was almost a little taken by surprise how like much people had to say about it, uh,

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:18.620
in a pleasant way, uh, over on our discord, over at vog network.com slash discord.

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:24.940
And I'm going to make a long story, very short, basically with the lists for both these, um,

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:30.380
you know, the, the Japanese and the U S one coming out, it was noted, um, that there are

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:34.940
some games missing from the U S one that are going to be in the Japanese ones, namely the

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.700
lunar games is what it comes down to.

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.820
So the lunar games that are going to be in the Japanese one will not be in the U S one.

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.660
And, you know, that's ridiculous.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.980
And people are pointing the fingers all over the place.

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:53.580
Um, there is a tweet that we were referenced here from mega drive shock, who kind of tries

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:54.780
to summarize what's going on here.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:59.900
Victor Ireland sold the N a publishing and script rights to lunar back to game arts.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:03.100
The only thing Ireland still owns is the audio.

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:07.740
The reason lunar won't be on the Genesis mini too is because Ireland wanted more money to

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:13.660
license the audio and, uh, it sources this Twitter account sources, an operation rainfall

01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:18.460
interview where, um, in the interview of operation rainfall, he was asked, is there any chance

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:21.260
of this occurring again with Gaijin works?

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:23.820
Um, which I think was something else that was happening at the time.

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:26.460
And, uh, Victor said, I'm not going to say no.

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:31.820
I think it would be cool to do, but the thing is that with the way the rights are with lunar,

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.740
we sold most of the rights back to game arts.

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:37.100
So game arts has almost all the rights to lunar, except for the performance rights to

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:37.900
the audio.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:42.060
So really they have most, uh, and if the lunar license was to happen, we would just be licensing

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:42.620
that little piece.

01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.260
So it could come out and it would probably come out under their name.

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:46.460
So they would do marketing for it.

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:51.100
So I think it's unlikely, but I'm not going to say no, it would be cool to do here's here's

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.100
my take, which I don't think I've seen yet.

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.620
And I just kind of want to plant this.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:55.180
Why?

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.140
Question mark seed.

01:14:56.780 --> 01:15:00.460
If the audio is what's holding it back, why don't they replace it?

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.580
What do you mean saying you can't replace it?

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.460
We just talked about it with Sonic, the hedgehog three.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.220
Do you know how much more money they would have to pay?

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:11.100
I know they just, they just did it with Sonic, the hedgehog.

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:15.180
And that was, that was Michael Jackson music.

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.300
Now, granted, that's a little different.

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:18.540
Yeah.

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:23.660
But I'm just like, I, if, if that is truly what's holding this back, I mean, but maybe

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:28.700
because they can, and I will be only because they can make so many of them and these types

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:33.660
of things, maybe it's just not worth it to have somebody go in there and redo things.

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.860
Bobby Black Wolf says lunar is also the voice acting.

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:42.380
Well, Konami tried to find a way around that too with the Silent Hill collection.

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.260
Didn't go so well for him though, at the end of the day.

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:49.100
So that can also be fixed, but fair.

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.940
But yeah, it's probably, and as Orange Wright says, it's too much effort probably for the

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:59.660
minimal amount of release that they're doing with these, you know, again, they're only

01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:03.740
going to sell what a 10th of what they had published last time, just due to the shortages

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:04.380
and all that stuff.

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:10.140
I would say, hold out hope, maybe that there'll be a third one of these and then maybe those

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:12.860
games will show up if there's the demand for them.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.180
But it's interesting.

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:20.460
So of course I, I kind of missed those Sega years personally.

01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:24.220
So to be honest, I've never played lunar, but I've heard a lot of great things about

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.700
it and I feel like, Oh, clearly I'm missing something there.

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:29.100
So, all right.

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:31.580
Anyway, let's move on.

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:39.100
Let's move on to, let's move on to a simpler time and a retro title that has had no problems

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.700
getting reported and republished over and over again.

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.540
We're going to go to the classic game of the week.

01:16:44.540 --> 01:17:00.540
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.780
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.420
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:07.100
All right.

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:10.700
And dark soccer, what classic game did you pick for folks this week?

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:12.460
I picked ice climber.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:21.820
Ice climber was a platformer that was developed and published by Nintendo first for the versus

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.260
system, the arcade versus system in 1984.

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:34.780
And then after that for the Famicom and NES in 1985, the characters were Popo and Nana.

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:38.300
Although in the German version, they were Pepe and Nana.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.420
They were known as the ice climbers.

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:49.420
And they had to go through 32 vertically scrolling mountains to recover stolen vegetables

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.460
from a giant condor.

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:56.380
And in some European countries, ice climber was bundled with the NES.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:04.540
The versus ice climber has a little animated title screen and the stage select menu at

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.780
the start of the game in between levels.

01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:14.140
16 more mountains, occasional blizzards and wind effects, more enemy characters and bonus

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:15.180
multiplayer items.

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:22.940
And of course, as we know, Nana and Popo were playable in the Smash Brothers series, starting

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:25.260
with Super Smash Brothers Melee on GameCube.

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:31.020
And we'll get into other bits of this later.

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:38.780
But player one is Popo, player two is Nana wearing a blue and pink parka respectively.

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:47.260
They have a mallet to carve out cave openings in the ice above and to hit enemies.

01:18:47.900 --> 01:19:00.940
And each of the different mountains have different enemies that will appear.

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:04.460
And you have a bonus stage for each level.

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:08.940
So each mountain is eight layers of ice and then the bonus stage.

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:15.180
Some square blocks that have higher detail are indestructible, so you have to take a

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:15.740
different path.

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:22.940
There's also hatched ice that is sort of a sliding conveyor belt thing for Nana or Popo

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:23.500
left or right.

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:27.660
And then there's these clouds that you can't break.

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:33.500
But anyway, you have to go up the mountain and defeat enemies and keep going.

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:43.580
Now, as I said in the arcade version, there were some other differences.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:52.300
You have, once you go through the initial set of 24 mountains, you have another 24 to

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:55.660
go through and then Condor is replaced by a giant butterfly.

01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:01.660
And then after the next eight stages are cleared, you get bonus round and then you pick up the

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:10.540
cycle all over again and it keeps a track whether it was claimed by, well, the mountain

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:14.460
was claimed by an ice climber or if it's still topi territory.

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:23.180
So they get trickier, they get harder, and then after each bonus stage, those scores

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:27.740
are tallied and points are awarded for various things.

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:33.340
And it does keep track of the high score, although you cannot save it on the NES version.

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:47.020
As far as, you know, a few other things going on with this, there were different releases,

01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:49.660
but I want to go back a little bit into the development history.

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:59.500
Ice Climber and NES Open Tournament Golf were directed by Miki Kenji, a long time Nintendo

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.540
producer.

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:06.940
It was also the first game programmed by Morita Kazuaki, and it was, as he says, his warm

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.980
up before becoming the main programmer on Super Mario Brothers.

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:20.700
And he also was credited with central programming for other games in the Super Mario Brothers

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.420
series, Legend of Zelda series, and Star Fox 64.

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:30.140
So Ice Climber was a launch title for the NES in North America and then was re-released

01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:31.180
with some of the consoles.

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:39.980
The PC-8801 version had a more limited color palette and a reworked HUD, versus Ice Climber

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:48.220
has been re-released for Famicom Disk, removing the difficulty settings, and then having graphics

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.900
closer to Ice Climber.

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:57.500
It also was released in Arcade Archives for Nintendo Switch, although they removed the

01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:58.700
B enemy.

01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:09.260
The NES game is unlockable in Animal Crossing for GameCube, and it can only be officially

01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:11.740
unlocked via e-reader in North America.

01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:24.620
And then it was also a gift for players that requested their save data be transferred from

01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:32.060
the Japanese Dobutsu Nomori to the Dobutsu Nomori Plus Edition.

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:38.540
So as far as various systems it has been on, we'll go ahead and start.

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:48.460
We have the Arcade Versus, Famicom NES, the NEC PC-8801 published by Hudson Soft, the

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:56.460
Famicom Disk System port, the e-reader version, Game Boy Advance, Wii Virtual Console, 3DS

01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:01.820
Virtual Console, Wii U Virtual Console, Nintendo Switch Online, and Nintendo Switch Arcade

01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:02.380
Archives.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:12.940
As of April 1st, 1985, it was the eighth most successful table arcade unit according to

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:13.980
Japan Machine.

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:26.940
And the former president of Finland, Mano Koivisto, was a big fan of Nintendo games,

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.500
and his son-in-law said that Ice Climber was his favorite.

01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:37.980
Computer Entertainer said that the American release was addictive for fans of climbing

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.380
games.

01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:49.340
As far as its legacy is considered, they are playable characters in the NES, the 2.5D version

01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:56.540
of the NES Summit level throughout Super Smash Brothers, and they are voiced by Kobayashi

01:23:56.540 --> 01:24:10.300
Sanai, and then they were removed for 3DS and Wii U because of the difficulty in maintaining

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.820
parity between the two characters.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:20.060
And then they had themes from Ice Climber appear regularly in the WarioWare series,

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:24.220
and Kirby Nightmare in Dream Land and Kirby Air Ride.

01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:31.020
Kirby gets a freeze ability, and he wears Popo's parka the same way as in Super Smash

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:31.420
Brothers.

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:42.540
There's Ice Climber in Tetris DS, and then Daigasso Band of Brothers includes the bonus

01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:49.420
stage music theme, and Ice Climbers appear in Super Mario Maker as unlockable Mystery

01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:50.780
Mushroom costumes.

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:58.700
I love that.

01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:03.900
Ice Climbers is such a gem, and you know, once again, chat kind of calling out, here

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:06.540
we are episode 927 and never done this game.

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.980
That's the great thing about this segment is that, you know, there's just so many games

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:13.980
out there, and we've played a lot more games than we think.

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:19.260
You know, it's pretty wild that, you know, yeah, we've done this segment since episode

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:20.140
250.

01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:24.140
So give or take 700, 650, 700 unique games.

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:29.100
I think maybe there's been an accidental repetition like twice, or maybe when you did

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.780
like soundtracks, you kind of repeated some games because you were focusing on the soundtracks,

01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:35.580
but like honestly, 650 unique games.

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:37.580
That's a lot of games.

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:39.580
You know, people have played a lot of games over the years.

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:42.780
But anyway, Ice Climbers is certainly one that I remember fondly.

01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:44.460
There are a lot of games in the world.

01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.100
Yes, there are.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:45.340
Yes, there are.

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.220
People have played them.

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:47.980
There are.

01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:48.380
There are.

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:53.900
And there's more made every single day, especially thanks to indies and the whole scene.

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:56.060
So we'll never run out of games for this segment.

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.180
All right.

01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:58.860
There it is.

01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.700
Ice Climbers, a real classic.

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:05.580
And yeah, it's just somebody had referenced in chat how, you know, Ice Climbers kind of

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:11.500
comes from that era of like that NES launch cartridge era where all those games kind of

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:15.260
ran on a very similar engine and had this kind of a similar look and feel to them.

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:17.100
That very, that same font.

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:21.020
I think that Nintendo system font that really, you know, kind of ties a lot of those early

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:21.740
games together.

01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:28.460
Just all the menus and everything were kind of similar to very much like arcade ports,

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:31.980
probably because they were based off the versus versus.

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:37.420
So anyway, but Ice Climbers definitely like for me, like just a gold, even if, yes, it's

01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:38.700
hard as hell.

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:43.660
It's the jumping is impossible to control, but that's what the game is.

01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:45.580
Who puts conveyor belts on a mountain?

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:48.460
I don't know, but that's, you know, that's part of the game's charm.

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:51.820
It was so difficult that when you actually got to the top of the mountain, you really

01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:53.020
did accomplish something.

01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.380
It's like that game's not easy.

01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.420
So all right.

01:26:55.420 --> 01:27:01.180
Anyway, let's move on and talk about some other news happening in the gaming world quickly

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:02.860
here in rapid fire news.

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:03.360
Loki.

01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:09.660
All right, so Sony is going to be, well, a couple of things.

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.460
First, Death Stranding is coming to Games Pass.

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:16.700
So originally that was something that was available on PlayStation.

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:22.460
Well, of course, now on PC Game Pass, since it is out in PC, it is going to be available.

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:29.740
And so we got a little tweet from Xbox Game Pass PC that shows, you know, special delivery.

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:34.380
And yeah, I'm excited to play this on my new PC.

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.300
I really is.

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:39.260
Is it the special edition or is it just the regular one?

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.340
I don't know.

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.460
Or it's a special edition.

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:44.140
Whatever the PC one was.

01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.380
Oh, which I don't know if they ever released.

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:51.580
Yeah, it says despite five or five, also releasing a PC version of the director's cut.

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:59.500
The original game is it says the on the Games Pass stuff.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:04.380
It says describes it as the original version of Hideo Kojima is critically claimed and

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.820
genre defined epic.

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:09.580
That's hard to say if it's going to be the director's cut or not, but.

01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:14.460
I'm just going to assume it's not at this point, but oh, well, I'll still check it out

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:17.500
because it'll probably look even better than it did when I played it on PlayStation the

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.000
first time.

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:19.100
Yeah, probably.

01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:24.700
And then Sony is also going to be developing a Days Gone movie, apparently.

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:35.500
So according to Deadline, Sam Hagen is circling the project and screenwriter Sheldon Turner

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.300
is adapting.

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:41.740
So we'll have to see what that's like, I guess.

01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:42.860
Other zombie movie.

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:47.100
No shortage of video game related media lately, right?

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.660
I keep seeing that Uncharted finally hit Netflix.

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:51.980
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:54.700
I haven't got a chance to watch it or if I'm going to.

01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:56.300
Dark Sakura.

01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:02.860
So in other news going on, I saw this and I was like, oh, that looks good.

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:11.420
Some fans are remaking the first Resident Evil in Unreal Engine 5, and it looks really,

01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:12.460
really, really good.

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:19.180
They're calling it Biohazard RE1 Classic Edition.

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:24.380
And it honestly is looking really good.

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:27.020
They're hoping to have that out.

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:29.420
I'm trying to see when they said.

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:38.460
No, I don't have I don't see a date on it, but they seem to like quite a lot for Jill

01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:43.660
Dunn, like their little trailer has her doing the Moonlight Sonata scene to open the door

01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:48.540
and her working with Barry and some of her voice lines recorded.

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.020
So it looks really good.

01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:52.140
Awesome.

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:55.900
And they're also working on doing a non fixed dangle version.

01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:58.060
Oh, yeah.

01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:04.460
All right, quickly, in another part of the gaming universe, QuakeCon 2022 happened this

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.500
last weekend.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:09.820
It was virtual again this year, so it was mostly streaming announcements and things

01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:10.380
of that sort.

01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:16.540
However, obviously, with Microsoft having picked up Bethesda some time ago, these QuakeCons

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:18.140
end up being a lot of Bethesda announcements.

01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:21.500
And lately it's about how they're partnering with Microsoft.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.780
And again, a lot of Xbox Game Pass releases.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:29.340
Six Bethesda games for Xbox Game Pass PC.

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:33.340
Please note this is PC and is not a Series X or anything.

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:39.420
But Wolfenstein 3D as in the classic, which I think Jamie, didn't we have that as a classic

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:41.660
game, like not even like three months ago or something?

01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:42.220
It was recent.

01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:43.100
Yeah, we did.

01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:49.660
Yeah, so that is now on Game Pass PC, as is the return to Castle Wolfenstein, the reboot

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:50.860
they did years later.

01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:56.060
Quake 4, Quake Champions, that game, I think it was already free to play, but it's like

01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:57.820
you get all the champions unlocked in that.

01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:02.780
And then for some reason, even though it's QuakeCon, we got some Elder Scrolls announcements.

01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:06.620
Battlespire and Redguard are also now on Xbox Game Pass PCs.

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:10.940
So it's like some more classic titles, mostly, besides the Quake Champions.

01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:13.500
Pretty cool that that's all available.

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:18.700
I also noticed Doom 64 was on Epic Game Stores, the freebie.

01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:22.940
So this is not just limited to Xbox Game Pass stuff.

01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:26.300
There's some other stuff going on around the gaming universe as well.

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:32.380
So if no one special 77 is out there somewhere, enjoy all those free games, including Doom

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.220
64, which is not bad.

01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:35.980
It's worth checking out for sure.

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:40.540
So all right, let's move on with some more stories.

01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:43.500
Oh, actually, no, we're going to go to some release dates first and check out the games

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.580
that are coming out this week.

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:49.340
Loki, I don't think I need to ask about the big one in the US this week because you already

01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:50.540
said you were going to stream it.

01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:53.740
But humor us and recap the releases anyway.

01:31:54.380 --> 01:32:00.860
The big one this week is Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:03.740
4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:08.540
Is it still that comic that that told all the Rednet jokes that host that?

01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:09.740
Or did they have to have a...

01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:11.980
Yes, I literally forgot his name.

01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:13.980
Was just Jeff Foxworthy.

01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:15.740
But you know who's hosting it now?

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.540
No, that's always cool.

01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:17.260
Who hosts it now?

01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:20.540
Well, nobody, because you can't see him.

01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:22.380
But it's John Cena.

01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:23.900
Is it really?

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:25.260
Yeah.

01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:26.460
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:27.100
I don't know.

01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:28.300
I literally don't know.

01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.020
Or I'm sorry.

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:29.420
Yeah.

01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:32.540
So well, actually, it was revived with John Cena.

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:37.340
So he hosted from June 10th through November 2019.

01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:39.500
I'm not surprised at all that John Cena is hosting a game show.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.060
Of course he is.

01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:44.220
If it's still is it still even on TV?

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:49.420
Like I saw like I was like we went to the theaters for something and they had, you know,

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:51.980
those advertisements before the show type thing.

01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:53.500
And I think they were showing that.

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.340
And I saw John Cena, you know, seemed like what?

01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.660
Yeah, I don't know if it's it's back on again.

01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:03.260
And honestly, I'm going to be is terrible game show.

01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:04.700
Like I love game shows.

01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:07.100
I think that game show is really one of the worst.

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:09.740
It's a one trick pony show.

01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:12.220
And like the gag is old after five minutes.

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:15.100
I think it's really one of the worst game shows they've ever made.

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:17.180
I think I don't know why he's watching it.

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:18.620
Why do you bring it back?

01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:20.860
But it's it's called something else.

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:24.220
And it's not like are you smarter than are you a dumb shit?

01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:25.420
It's like something.

01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:27.580
Actually, I don't want to use that word because it's ableist.

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:30.540
But like, like, are you?

01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:34.060
But but that's that's the whole that's the whole gag of the show.

01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:35.260
I just I just don't care for the show.

01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.420
But anyway, there's other games coming out, right, Loki?

01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:38.940
Yeah.

01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:39.260
Yeah.

01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:46.140
So aside from that, there's going to be Fallen Legion Revenants, which is on PC, PlayStation

01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:50.060
five, Xbox one, Xbox series, Fallen Legion, Rise of Glory.

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:53.020
That is also going to be on the same platforms as well.

01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:59.420
Midnight Fight Express on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:05.100
Saints Row is going to be out on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one.

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:06.140
And Xbox series.

01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:07.820
God, I hope it doesn't suck.

01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:11.500
How are you feeling right now on the eve of that game?

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:14.700
I am not super excited about it.

01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:18.300
I am going to play it, but I am not like hyped on it.

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.180
That's a good place to be, because you know what?

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:26.300
It can only exceed your expectations and not be even lower.

01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:26.700
Yeah, I know.

01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:34.780
But the chances of it exceeding your expectations are much higher than if you're like,

01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.740
middle ground, you know, you're not like over.

01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:40.300
Like, I just I'm not super excited about it.

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:45.900
It's a better place than where I'm at with Final Fantasy 16, because I know and I'm sitting

01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:48.140
here going, do not put the bar too high.

01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:50.220
Do not put the bar at a level that is insurmountable.

01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:53.420
I can't I can say that on one hand and on the other.

01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:58.380
I am completely like, but this game, I'm so hyped for it.

01:34:58.380 --> 01:34:59.660
I cannot wait.

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.660
There are so many talented people involved.

01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:03.100
This is going to be the best thing.

01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.100
This will be the best video game that's ever been made.

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:07.500
I can't help it.

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.580
I just the hype machine is in full effect.

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.260
So yeah, but you're in it.

01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:13.500
You're in a healthier place for your fandom, Loki.

01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.420
I don't like that.

01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:19.900
I don't like the characters right now as from an outside looking in without actually playing

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:20.940
the game yet.

01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:22.780
I don't like the way the characters.

01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:24.780
I don't like the characters themselves.

01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:27.580
Maybe they'll grow me, you know, and that's perfectly fine.

01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:30.860
And I would love to be like surprised by that.

01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:32.780
Maybe there'll be a plot twist about the character.

01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:37.500
Like the movie Orphan or something, a big revelation that makes the movie 10 times cooler.

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.180
20 times.

01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:46.700
By the way, Orphan first cut is now apparently on Paramount Plus and it's just as wild.

01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:50.860
Like everything I'm here is just as wild.

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:54.300
I hope that it shares something in common with a game that's coming out later in the

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:55.900
week, which we'll get to in just a second here.

01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:56.220
OK.

01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:59.180
And it is pretty buggy.

01:35:59.180 --> 01:35:59.820
So we'll see.

01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.820
I hope we'll see.

01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:09.740
Anyways, there's also Yars Recharged, which is coming out on PC, Mac, Linux, Nintendo

01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:16.780
Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Stadia and Atari VCS.

01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:17.900
Anything with a monitor.

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:19.980
Every everything.

01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:20.620
All of it.

01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:21.340
Your toaster.

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:31.260
Looks like Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:37.180
We have Alice's Warped Wonderland Recollection on Nintendo Switch.

Earth Defense Force 6 on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:48.060
Hack, which is on PC and Nintendo Switch.

01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:51.660
I was a teenage exocolonist.

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:53.500
That's quite a name.

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:58.540
On PC, Mac and Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:02.540

01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:21.660
Chin Chan, me and the professor on summer vacation.

01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:23.500
The endless seven day journey.

01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:26.460
Well, it's not endless if it's only seven days.

01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:27.420
It doesn't make any sense.

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:31.020
That's I guess that's true.

01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:33.180
That's on PlayStation 4.

01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:39.820
Soul Hackers 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:43.340
The Bridge Curse Road to Salvation on PC.

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:47.100
Brock the Investigator on PC.

01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:54.060
The Company Man on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:59.260
Also, it looks like we've got Fallen Legion Revenants and Fallen Legion Rise of Glory

01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:07.180
coming out on again, I don't know, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:10.140
I'm sure there's something to have different regions there or something.

01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:18.620
Nexomon plus Nexomon Extinction Complete Collection on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox

01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:19.120
One.

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:27.500
Pac-Man World Repack on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:28.000
Series.

01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:35.740
And last but not least, Soul Hackers 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox

01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:36.380
Series.

01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:36.940
That's it.

01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:39.820
S.J. 100 Matt in chat noting a lot coming out this week.

01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:47.020
Yeah, we are in the fourth quarter, that pre-Labor Day kind of pushing out all the third quarter

01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:50.140
releases and pretty soon the holiday season.

01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:52.300
So, yeah, it's going to be that time of year.

01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:55.660
The gaming industry fourth quarter that starts in August and ends in November.

01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:56.620
You know that one.

01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:57.120
Yeah.

01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:00.380
Questbuster says Gamescom also starts this week on the 23rd.

01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:01.260
It's true.

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:01.740
That's right.

01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:07.580
There's the Jeff Keighley event, which I am pleased to see that they are showcasing Goat

01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:08.460
Simulator 3.

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:09.820
So very interested in that.

01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:11.420
When is that?

01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:12.540
Is that Thursday morning?

01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:15.740
I think because I think we got an email Thursday something.

01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:19.180
I saw something on Twitter on that.

01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:23.020
This may surprise you all, but VOG Network is a friend of Jeff Keighley because he always

01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:24.300
emails us about his events.

01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.100
I don't mind at all.

01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:29.500
This is the only bummer is most of these events are during the working day and and VOG Network

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.660
does not pay any of our bills, believe it or not.

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:35.660
So I can't do both when the day job is conflicted.

01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:40.140
So but I'm excited to see what all they do show at the opening night at Gamescom.

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:40.700
That'll be fun.

01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:45.020
Okay, let's quickly try to run through Japan's releases.

01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:46.860
But they have a lot as well, but I'll try to make it quick.

01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:51.340
So on the Switch, Disco Elysium, the final cut gets a release officially on the Switch

01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:52.620
in Japan this week.

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:56.780
We also have SD Gundam Battle Alliance gets released in Japan as well this week.

01:39:56.780 --> 01:40:00.060
Idol Manager, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge.

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.940
Yeah, I guess that wasn't out in Japan yet on the Switch, but that will be coming this

01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.780
week on August the 25th.

01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:09.980
Pac-Man World Repack also coming out in Japan as it is in the US this week.

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:15.900
And Tetsudon Nippon, Rosentabi Meichi Tetsudon Hen comes out this week as well.

01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:22.060
We also have a new Pikachu versus Meowth branded controller that's coming out.

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:22.700
Cool.

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:25.820
If that's something you like to do is collect those various types of controllers.

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:26.940
That's everything on the Switch.

01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:28.940
If you want to look on the PlayStation 5, guess what?

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:33.180
If you're a Saints Row fan in Japan, it's also coming out in Japan this week.

01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:37.740
There's also a Notorious Edition, which is basically the limited edition also coming

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:38.700
out in Japan this week.

01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:43.500
Disco Elysium is also making its way to the PlayStation 5 in Japan this week.

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:48.300
And Earth Defense Force 6 also hits Japanese PlayStation 5 this week.

01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.100
But that's not all.

01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:57.420
SD Gundam Battle Alliance, Soul Hackers 2, Rustler, Sword and Fairy Together Forever,

01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:03.340
Idol Manager, Pac-Man World Repack, all of that on PlayStation 5 this week.

01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:06.460
So there's a lot of games on their way.

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.820
So all right, let's go to Europe.

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:10.700
Dark Sakura, please.

01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:14.620
Actually, not very many things on the list.

01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.140
Saints Row on August 23rd.

01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:20.140
In fact, most of these are August 23rd.

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:22.220
That's on PlayStation and Xbox.

01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:24.140
Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?

01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:25.740
On multiple systems.

01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:29.820
Nintendo Switch OLED Models Splatoon 3 edition.

01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:31.180
So there's that.

01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:37.580
Among Us Ejected Edition on PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.

01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:43.580
And then on the 26th, we have Soul Hackers 2 and Pac-Man World Repack.

01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:47.340
And that's it.

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.140
All righty.

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:52.860
Is anyone curious about the Pac-Man World Repack?

01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:53.660
I kind of am.

01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:54.620
I kind of want to play it.

01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:55.020
I don't know.

01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:57.740
After I play all my other Pac-Man games.

01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:58.380
Yeah, right.

01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:01.180
I saw that museum game to keep pushing through, too.

01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:04.380
So is it like a rerelease of the old game?

01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:05.340
It's a remaster.

01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:07.340
So they've redone it, basically.

01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:08.940
So I'm curious about it.

01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:11.100
Just can't get excited about Pac-Man.

01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:12.940
I see.

01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.300
They're very hit and miss for me.

01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:15.500
Some of them are crap.

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:20.140
But like Pac-Man Championship Edition and Championship Edition 2 gave that series a

01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:21.900
swift kick in the butt that it badly needed.

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:22.780
They were really good.

01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:25.740
So like there are good Pac-Man releases still.

01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:31.740
I think Pac-Man needs to have like the social media person that controls the Sonic the Hedgehog

01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:33.660
Twitter account to like.

01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:36.380
No, they need the person that controls the Radio Shack Twitter account.

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:38.540
Maybe not that.

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:39.580
That's a little bit too much.

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:43.260
I want Pac-Man to be edgy.

01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:44.860
All right.

01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:45.980
That would be pretty edgy.

01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:52.700
Let's move on and touch on a few more headlines before we get to listener roundtable and your

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:55.500
thoughts and calls and tweets, etc.

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:56.380
But first, Loki.

01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:02.860
I'm sure what I'm going to assume that they're going to describe as another horrible misstep.

01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:11.660
There's another allegation of Call of Duty stealing other people's artwork again.

01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:14.540
So we talked about this a while back or not even a while back.

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:18.140
I think it was a couple of weeks ago about how they had to pull the skin off of their

01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:25.260
marketplace because it stole the it basically plagiarized the work of one of the artists

01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:26.460
out there that created skin.

01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:29.500
Well, this time they're even being more bold about it.

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:34.940
And they are apparently putting out skin that looks awfully similar.

01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:42.700
Not quite identical this time, but certainly extremely similar to a heavily inspired by

01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:45.020
heavily inspired by.

01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:53.660
And this is like by Robert Bolling, or as you may know him, four zero two, who it was

01:43:53.660 --> 01:44:01.500
an Infinity Ward guy now working with Dr. Disrespect on their new game, Midnight Society.

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:07.420
And he actually showed a skin that was going to be in that game.

01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:08.700
And oh, look at that.

01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:12.220
Now, all of a sudden, it's coming out for Call of Duty.

01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:15.980
Yeah, go figure.

01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:18.540
This is certainly very, very similar.

01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.700
Legally distinct, I think is what they call that, right?

01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:25.340
All right.

01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:26.640
Yeah.

01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:31.980
Well, switching gears completely, Dark Soccer has a sad story for us, but one with the silver

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:32.480
lining.

01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:33.920
Yeah.

01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:43.900
So an indie developer by the name of Rob Hale has recently died, and he left final wishes

01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:54.460
that his first published game and its sequel are out for free on Steam.

01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:57.660
He's also known as Squid in a Box.

01:44:57.660 --> 01:45:07.100
He died of cancer, and his partner CJ put the announcement out that Waves and the next

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:13.660
game that was in development, Waves 2, would be made free to download on Steam.

01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:20.300
CJ is quoted saying this is something Rob was considering anyway with the past two months

01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:24.460
as their health entered into more substantial difficulties.

01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:28.300
I hope this can be seen as a parting gift to all of those out there that haven't yet

01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:29.740
played either of these games.

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:42.620
So both of them are twin-stick shooters, very colorful, very pretty neon lights, and definitely

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:43.980
seem like they're a lot of fun.

01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:46.140
So definitely go check it out.

01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:52.380
This is a very lovely thing to do to really kind of show the impact that you had on the

01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:57.100
world through art, because art is something that many of us contribute in different ways.

01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:01.420
One could argue that this very podcast is in fact art.

01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:07.180
It's a certain type of art, but it's art, and art is one of those things that we leave

01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:08.300
behind on this world, right?

01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:12.780
I call this the found medium, found object medium.

01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:15.980
So you would say it's found art or fart for short.

01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.700
Well, technically it would be found object medium.

01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:27.580
But anyway, in all seriousness, and not to laugh at what is otherwise a very serious

01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:34.220
thing, this is a very lovely thing to really gift the world your art as you move on to

01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:37.980
the next adventure and really show everyone the mark you left behind.

01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:38.940
I think that's really cool.

01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.540
And yeah, I'll definitely check the game out.

01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:44.860
I remember hearing about Waze a while ago.

01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:48.220
I want to say maybe I even saw it, but I don't think I necessarily played it.

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.580
So I'll certainly check it out.

01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:50.780
Good chance.

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:58.540
For the record, when I noticed, I mean, both of them are PC games, but Waze 2 actually

01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:01.260
has Steam Deck compatibility if anyone has one.

01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:01.760
Neat.

01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:04.300
All right, let's move on.

01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:05.500
Loki, just a few more stories.

01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:12.940
All right, so we always make the joke, you know, what is Doom running on now?

01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:17.660
So now someone has gotten Doom to run on a farm tractor.

01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:23.020
So now you can, you know, harvest and play Doom at the same time.

01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.820
And also loop killers.

01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:28.620
Sorry, Rob.

01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:29.340
That's for Rob.

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:30.620
I get it.

01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:31.120
I get it.

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.320
All right.

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:36.720
So this was part of this was shown, I guess, at Def Con.

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:43.840
And so they're saying, you know, as part of this process, they use the source port dehacked

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:44.340
Doom.

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:52.080
And then, of course, another modder, Skelligant, was able to create a farm themed Doom mod

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:56.080
to be able to play on the John Deere's tractor jailbroken system.

01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:56.580
Of course.

01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.920
It's less important that the John Deere tractors run Doom.

01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:05.760
It's more important that they've jailbroken the system because John Deere locks down a

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:11.280
lot of these computers and stuff for they're trying to stop right to repair.

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:19.040
So that is really the motivation for them to, you know, try to hack the John Deere systems.

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:23.040
But of course, you know, if you hack something, you want to show that you can run Doom on

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.160
it because why not?

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.280
Orange right.

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:29.440
With a very good question in chat saying sooner or later, we'll see Doom running in farm

01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:30.080
simulator.

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.440
That would be very meta, right?

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.520
Have Doom in farming simulator on the tractor.

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.920
Yeah, that would be I can't wait.

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:37.280
All right.

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:42.960
Or just have like the marine be on a tractor driving through over, you know, demons in

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:43.460
hell.

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:48.640
Oh, so basically make it Doom, but farming.

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.600
No, he's not farming anything.

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:54.000
He's just running over people with a tractor or demons.

01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:55.840
He's far.

01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:56.880
He's farming kills.

01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.400
Farming kills.

01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:58.960
Exactly.

01:48:58.960 --> 01:48:59.680
Farming kills.

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:04.880
I farm blood points on a tractor in Dead by Daylight.

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.480
Womp womp.

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:07.520
Womp womp.

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:08.020
All right.

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:11.680
We have one more announcement tonight.

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:13.040
One more story to get into.

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:16.480
Do you remember last week we had an announcement of an announcement?

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:19.120
It was Sunsoft was set to reveal something.

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:24.080
Well, they revealed it, and the game they announced was Iki Unite.

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:30.240
It is a revival of a 1985 arcade and Famicom roguelike game for PC.

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:36.800
It's going to launch in 2022, but this will support up to 16 players online.

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.840
And there's a very, very, very short teaser video that's out there, but it is something

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.720
you can kind of check out to see the game in motion there, which it's interesting because

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:52.320
I've heard people say it just looks like they're riding the vampire survivors train.

01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:59.040
And even though this is a remake or reimagining, if you will, of a game that was made in 1985,

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:06.640
yeah, I'm definitely getting the vampire survivors vibe from this game.

01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:10.800
Yeah, which is, you know, there's a lot of knockoff games for that right now,

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:11.840
so I'm not really surprised.

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:13.440
And that's a great game.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:17.360
So, yeah, but that was the big Sunsoft reveal was this particular game.

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:21.280
So sorry if you were like me and you were waiting for Fester's Quest to come back.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Unfortunately, that will not be coming out.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.320
However, before I get to listen to Roundtable,

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:29.200
does anyone else see that trailer for the Wednesday Netflix series?

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:30.160
Yes.

01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:32.560
I think it looks really good.

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:36.320
I think there's a lot of people that are ready to hate on it, but I think it looks good.

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:40.320
First off, and I think a lot of people have already addressed this,

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.080
but I'm just going to say I don't have any problem with Luis Guzman as

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:48.000
Gomez, and they made him look more like the comics.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:48.560
It's fine.

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:54.400
Yeah, that was the thing is that they thought Raul Julia was too handsome to be a proper Gomez.

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.440
Which fair.

01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.240
He was a handsome fucking guy.

01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:03.520
Short and very stout and not all that good looking.

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:08.000
Yeah, so but I loved the tone of the trailer.

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:12.400
It was that perfect blend of very dry humor.

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:14.720
Who did they cast?

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:16.720
Jenny Ortega, I think is her name.

01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:19.600
She was also the girl in the opening scene in the new screen movie.

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:20.800
She's having a great year.

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:21.360
She's great.

01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:25.280
She had just that right amount of dryness in that scene and everything.

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:25.760
It was good.

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.560
I enjoyed it.

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:29.680
So I don't get excited about it on TV, any show.

01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:31.920
Yeah, but I'm excited for that one.

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:34.000
And some people were saying that it was too much.

01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.240
They shouldn't be making dick jokes.

01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:38.000
No, they didn't.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:42.480
They listen very carefully to the words they chose and the way they did it.

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:45.040
There's a lot there.

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.680
That's your dirty ass brain filling in the gaps.

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:50.720
They did not explicitly say the Piranha was biting him in the dick.

01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:53.520
So just something to do that.

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:59.680
So, um, DJ says, uh, Luis Guzman is too much of an oblong head and his hair looks like

01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:00.960
a cheap toupee recast.

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.480
I will say the hair.

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:07.120
The hair is the one thing where I'm like, and I could see where people take issue with

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:14.080
that, but I, I think it's one of those things where it's like the, the, um, what would

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:14.560
you call it?

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:20.800
The, um, the, the meter was turned up to 11 in the, um, over the top department with that

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:21.680
wig, I think.

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:24.480
So, but I, I, I, I'm excited to see the emotion.

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:28.560
The other thing to keep in mind, he's actually not a main character in this show.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
So he's in it, but he's not a main character.

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:34.880
So, cause it's, it's a Wednesday spinoff show.

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:38.000
So Wednesday's main character, I believe Morticia is for some reason.

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:41.200
Um, but yeah, so I'm excited for the show to be honest.

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:42.400
Yeah.

01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:48.400
And I'm putting a link for those who don't know, I'm putting a link in chat of what,

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:52.720
what the original comic Gomez looked like.

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:53.120
Yeah.

01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:54.880
And pretty much how perfect.

01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:00.000
Um, yeah, as I also agree with Sarah when I'm at, apparently they're keeping Fester's

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.920
casting under really tight lock and key.

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:02.960
So it's gotta be big.

01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:03.200
Yeah.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:08.640
There's been no, nothing on who is playing Fester or if Fester's even in the show, it

01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:11.040
could be one of those things where he's not showing up to later season.

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.080
I don't know, but we'll see.

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:14.960
What if they got Christopher Lloyd to do it again?

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:15.680
That'd be amazing.

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:19.840
Christopher Lloyd though has like lost a lot of weight.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:20.560
Oh yeah.

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.840
He, and he is in his late eighties.

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:24.160
He's, he's fairly up there.

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:24.660
Yeah.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.680
Even just for a scene, just for a scene.

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:28.180
All right.

01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:32.580
Uh, let's get into, although, you know, who is in it.

01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.980
I will say who is in it is Christina Ricci's in it.

01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:36.580
And they're not saying who she's playing.

01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:37.780
Now.

01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:44.740
I don't know if she's that, that, that would be a hoot if she's uncle Fester, but I don't

01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:45.380
think so either.

01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:46.500
I don't see how that works.

01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.340
I think she'd be like a teacher or something.

01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:52.900
I think, I think, I think she goes the complete off opposite and she's like the harmony hut

01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:54.580
lady in this, uh, this one.

01:53:54.580 --> 01:53:55.620
So we'll see what happens.

01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:56.820
All right.

01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:58.740
Anyway, let's get to the listener round table.

01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:03.060
We will take on any questions that you might have as well as your tweets and your emails

01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:07.460
over at, uh, participate at orange lounge radio.com.

01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.900
I think I saw at least one, uh, uh, for reading tonight.

01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:11.620
So let's get to it.

01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:12.660
Uh, our email tonight.

01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:16.420
Um, this comes from Ziva.

01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:16.740
Yay.

01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:23.860
A free com, a free company in final fantasy 14 called, uh, Cirque is doing a production

01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:25.780
of clue on August 27th.

01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:31.380
It starts at 9 PM EST on the Matias server, which is on the crystal data center.

01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:37.540
They perform all of their productions inside their free company house that is located in

01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:41.220
the lavender beds residential zone in ward 10 house three.

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:47.460
Since data center travel is now a thing, and I know there might be a handful of people

01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:48.420
interested in this.

01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:50.900
I thought I would email about it.

01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:53.060
I also posted this on the discord.

01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:57.620
Some of Cirque's past productions were beauty and the beast, Rocky horror picture show,

01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:01.940
little mermaid, labyrinth, the room, princess bride, and street fighter.

01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:05.860
Every single one of their performances are well scripted and choreographed.

01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:11.140
They have the players who obviously act out the parts players who are in charge of the

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:17.060
lighting and effects, and they give out watch together link, which has the music, um, arrive

01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:18.500
early because it fills up quickly.

01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:24.020
If you don't play final fantasy 14, but are interested in seeing this in game, you can

01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:29.620
create a free trial account on Matias and choose Gridania as your starting town.

01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:35.140
Then you can get to the lavender beds residential zone by talking to a central shroud skipper

01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:37.380
NPC outside of Gridania.

01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:43.380
You can also pick up a level 10 quest at bench brand in central shroud.

01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:48.260
Once complete, you can work to lavender beds using the main grid on yet either right at

01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:48.980
no charge.

01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:54.740
If you don't want to make an account and still are interested in seeing the, uh, the production,

01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:56.660
there's usually a live stream.

01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:01.620
If anyone has any questions, feel free to send me a DM on discord.

01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:03.540
Hope to see some of you there.

01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:04.420
And that's from Ziba.

01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:07.300
Oh, TD alcoholics and chat.

01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:07.800
Hi.

01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:10.580
Um, thank you Ziba for that.

01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:13.140
And yeah, Ziba tweeted that at me and you know, I was like, oh, I

01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:14.020
definitely want to come.

01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:17.460
The only bummer is I just found out, well, it's not a bummer for me, but it's a bummer

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:17.780
for this.

01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:21.220
I just found out that my friend from San Diego is going to be here visiting that same day.

01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:22.980
So I'm not sure I can actually go live.

01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:24.740
So I really hope it's on YouTube.

01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:31.220
I'm really curious if it's the movie or the play because it sounds like they've done plays

01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:31.780
in there.

01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:34.260
And most people know clue through the movie.

01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:37.780
Specifically said Rocky horror picture show is done.

01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:38.980
Not the Rocky horror show.

01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:39.780
Oh, good catch.

01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:40.180
Good catch.

01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:42.100
So they're basically redoing movies in there.

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:42.420
Okay.

01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:42.900
Interesting.

01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:48.580
Um, yeah, because there was a separate clue Broadway play about 10 years or off-Broadway

01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:49.780
or one of those about 10 years ago.

01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:50.260
So, okay.

01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.860
So they're doing the movie.

01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:56.340
Well, I'm curious because you don't see movies staged a lot.

01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:01.380
Although ironically, I did see a stage production of clue the movie.

01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.140
They were kind of doing it under the radar.

01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:04.340
I saw it in San Francisco.

01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:06.500
This is the same theater company.

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:11.940
Like six months later, they did star Wars and they got shut down in a heartbeat.

01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:16.420
Some, unfortunately they're a little too close to Lucasfilm store being in San Francisco

01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:17.860
and they got shut down for doing star Wars.

01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:22.260
But I wa I saw them do clue like six months prior and it was a lot of fun.

01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:25.140
So that is the first time I saw Mrs.

01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:26.820
Peacock played by a man.

01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:28.340
And I thought it was great.

01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:30.900
And I, I swore one day I would play Mrs.

01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:32.340
Peacock and I did.

01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:35.140
So that was, that was because of that performance.

01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:36.180
I had a great time with that.

01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:39.460
So, uh, but yeah, I'm, I'm excited to check it out.

01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:41.460
I really, really, really hope they archive it on YouTube.

01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:45.220
If I can't be there live, because I might, I might, because the East coast time difference,

01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:47.060
I might be able to be there for at least a little bit.

01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:49.220
So I'll be curious, but it sounds great.

01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:51.940
So completely off topic.

01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:52.180
Yeah.

01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:56.500
I'm sad that you're not watching celebrity drag race because then we would have something

01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:57.940
to talk about if no one emails.

01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:04.900
No, I just, I, I, I have to be careful how much dry grace I consume or I get sick of

01:58:04.900 --> 01:58:04.980
it.

01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:08.020
Like that's why I don't bother with any of the international versions anymore.

01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:09.300
I don't watch any of them.

01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:11.380
Although I'm pretty good.

01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:17.220
I heard drag race Philippines is like next level drama.

01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:18.900
Like it's apparently really good.

01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:23.940
And it's the only non U S edition to have an untucked.

01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:25.460
And for good reason, apparently.

01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:30.580
So I saw some clips floating around Twitter.

01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:31.220
It looked great.

01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:35.060
So anyway, it's great to see DDR alcoholic.

01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:36.260
Hey, heads up.

01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:37.300
So, so do your call.

01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:40.340
Like the reason why we're all a fanning and fawning is because that's somebody we used

01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:45.300
to play DDR with back in the day, uh, over at Roseville, in the years that this show

01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:45.940
was formed.

01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:46.260
Right.

01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:48.420
I would be curious.

01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:49.540
Well, I guess did your call.

01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:51.860
It kind of lives a little ways away now from what I remember.

01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:56.340
So she's not around the corner anymore, but I'd be curious if you ever made your way up

01:58:56.340 --> 01:59:01.140
to round one now that it's open in Roseville, I guess that's quite a distance, but it's

01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:02.180
worth asking.

01:59:02.180 --> 01:59:07.940
Cause just, just to, just to see, just to see how it's evolved and the kids today playing

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:09.060
the same games.

01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:11.700
So I'd be curious.

01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:13.220
All right.

01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:18.420
Let's get to some tweets at least over at twitter.com slash O L R because I know there

01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:23.780
was at least, I want to give a shout out to SSJ 100, Matt, who number one was the only

01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:29.700
person who actually tweeted us a picture of their O L R setup, complete with cameo doggy

01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:30.100
there.

01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:30.980
So enjoy that.

01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:32.100
That was great.

01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:33.220
I retweeted that as well.

01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:34.980
So, oh, actually, no, I didn't.

01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:36.820
Cause it's a locked account so I can only reply.

01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:41.300
So I guess I just showed somebody's private tweet, but I have a feeling he won't mind.

01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:41.620
All right.

01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:43.780
Let's see.

01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:51.300
Then number two for SSJ 100, Matt, I completely stole a meme he put in our discord and I passed

01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:52.100
it off as our own.

01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:53.220
Did you see that one Loki?

01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:57.220
Because he, he did the meme of the, the, I don't know, it looked like the girl yelling

01:59:57.220 --> 02:00:01.860
at the guy at the festival or whatever with the whole little like written message in all

02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:02.580
caps.

02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:07.780
Then the written message says, so then Loki said that if this weird card game sold 1 million

02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:10.820
copies, he would wear a costume of this character called Tingle.

02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:11.940
And there's a whole thing on that.

02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:12.820
I thought it was funny.

02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:16.180
That's, that's why I stole it and made it, made it our own.

02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:20.100
So thank you, SSJ 100, Matt, for letting me steal that without suing.

02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:26.980
Now, something else that got tweeted over to us, Dark Tetsuya actually tweeted us saying,

02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:28.340
I thought this was cool.

02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:33.060
Um, a recently preserved prototype version of NES NARC.

02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:35.460
You remember that game from the early nineties?

02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:36.900
I remember the arcade version.

02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:37.140
Yes.

02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:37.940
There was an arcade.

02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:40.260
It also had a cameo in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:42.100
And I think, wasn't there a Super Nintendo version?

02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:43.540
Yeah, I think.

02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:44.040
Yeah.

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:50.100
But there was supposed to be an NES version before Nintendo's sensors stepped in.

02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:54.020
So, uh, embedded a tweet from the account Forest Illusion.

02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:59.380
We preserved a prototype of NARC for the Nintendo Entertainment System developed by Rare Limited.

02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:03.780
According to the front label, this build was intended for demo purposes at CES.

02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:08.900
As for the build itself, it's uncensored and features various references to smoking

02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:10.500
and illicit drugs.

02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:14.100
And now that it's on the internet, of course, anybody can check it out there.

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.780
It's available to check out.

02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:19.620
You can see a whole thing on YouTube and they have some screenshots as well of what like

02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:22.340
the game looked like and so forth on the NES.

02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:23.700
So, uh, pretty cool.

02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:30.260
Fifth dream in chats is I played NARC so much in the Walmart lobby when I was a kid.

02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:31.140
Yeah.

02:01:32.980 --> 02:01:34.820
That says a lot about the nineties right there.

02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:37.300
But thank you for that tweet.

02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:39.060
That was everything we got on Twitter this week.

02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:43.860
Uh, I have to say I talked about NARC being in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:45.300
I was referring to the first movie.

02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:45.540
Oh yeah.

02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:45.860
The movie.

02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:46.420
Yeah.

02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:47.620
The one from the nineties.

02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:49.140
Yeah.

02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:49.380
So.

02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:52.500
The only movie TV.

02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:56.260
No, there were, there were, there were, I liked, I liked the third one.

02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:56.420
Yeah.

02:01:56.420 --> 02:01:57.860
I liked the third one too.

02:01:57.860 --> 02:01:59.700
I didn't even hate the second one.

02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:05.540
My friend and I watched that third one at least like 20 times.

02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:11.300
So I could quote the whole entire first movie with my friend Courtney.

02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:18.420
And we would do it when one of our friends at our little group at our lunch table would

02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:21.460
speak very loudly with her mouth full of food.

02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:24.260
I love it.

02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:25.700
All right.

02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:27.540
I don't think I ever watched the third one.

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:29.380
I was just the first and second one.

02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:30.420
They go back to ancient.

02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:30.980
Interesting.

02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:32.340
The third one is the time machine.

02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:33.860
They go back to ancient Japan.

02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:34.100
Yeah.

02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:34.900
That sounds stupid.

02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:37.140
Not bad.

02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:38.340
It had some fun stuff in it.

02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:42.020
It is, but in that awesome nineties kind of way.

02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:44.580
I don't know how else to explain it.

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:51.860
Do you remember the karate kid part two, which involved him going to Okinawa?

02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:55.460
That movie was fucking good.

02:02:55.460 --> 02:03:00.900
Like, you know, sometimes that whole, you know, uh, in a new pond type of situation

02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:01.860
works out very well.

02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:07.700
There though, a lot of people will say that in some cases, sequels are either utter trash

02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:08.980
or they're the best of the series.

02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:11.220
I know a lot of people prefer empire strikes back.

02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:12.980
I am a Jedi return to the Jedi person.

02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:20.820
There are people, you know, who say that every, you know, even numbered, um, uh, star Trek

02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:24.020
movie is good, you know?

02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:28.020
So now I'm thinking about karate kid part two.

02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:29.700
You remember that scene with the drums?

02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:32.020
That was, Oh, chills, chills.

02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:32.500
So good.

02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:34.500
I saw that in the theater, Rob.

02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:34.820
Yeah.

02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:36.660
I think I saw that one in the theater too.

02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:37.860
I remember it was really scary.

02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:45.460
The power, uh, the, the, the glory of love on 45.

02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:48.260
I love it.

02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:52.180
Do you kids, you know what a 45 is?

02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:53.540
It's a tiny record.

02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:58.100
And it usually had one song on both sides, which is where the term B side comes from.

02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:03.300
That's why your record player had a switch to go from 33 to 45.

02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:04.420
So this is funny.

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:10.980
Um, tiger is not just to play the songs in a weird, you know, no, it's not.

02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:13.460
Um, what was I going to say about karate kid?

02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:14.820
There was a third movie.

02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:16.900
I completely can't remember it.

02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:20.420
Like it was back in LA and I do not remember the plot whatsoever.

02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:23.060
And no, I have not seen Cobra Kai or any of the followups.

02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:28.500
Like it's really just about the very, I did see next karate kid, not, not the Will Smith

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:31.220
kid, uh, yeah, Hillary Swank.

02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:31.540
I did.

02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:36.420
I re I saw that one at the 99 cent theater and we're going to leave it at that.

02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:44.740
Um, tiger class says, I just thought it was silly that they had to make, um, Pat Morita

02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:45.940
dude, the fake accent.

02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:47.000
Yeah.

02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:51.940
Um, tiger con chat says, speaking of the karate kid, you heard the creators of Cobra

02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:54.580
Kai are going to do a spinoff of Ferris Bueller's day off.

02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:54.980
I did.

02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:59.620
I think I saw you or someone post that in our discord, but it's, it's odd.

02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:00.020
Okay.

02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:04.260
So do you remember in Ferris Bueller's day off when he goes to take the car to valet

02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:07.380
parking, that the valets go and they take it on a joy ride.

02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:12.020
And like, there's that one scene of them going over the Hill and that whole thing that,

02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:13.140
that is the spinoff.

02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:16.580
They're making a movie about the valet guys going on a joy ride.

02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:18.820
That's stupid, right?

02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:22.180
It's like all of all the spinoffs you can make.

02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:23.540
That's what you're making.

02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:24.040
Okay.

02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:30.900
I mean, I guess all the other actors are too old now and you could probably replace those

02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:34.660
actors and not many people would notice, but that's interesting.

02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:37.300
Then why even bring Ferris Bueller's day off into it?

02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:41.620
Like just, I think Matthew Broderick is a producer on it or something.

02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:48.020
I think it's just, it could be like, I want to make trashy ideas.

02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:52.180
Why don't we make a movie about all the baby Godzillas from Godzilla USA?

02:05:52.180 --> 02:05:56.500
I will wait for at least a trailer, but it just like in principle, it's just kind of

02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:57.220
like, huh?

02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:00.420
Do you know, do you know who needs a spinoff movie?

02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:03.220
You know, who needs to spin off Edie McClurg.

02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:06.900
And I don't know if you've apparently she's not doing too well.

02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:08.340
Um, I mean, bless her heart.

02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:12.580
She's, you know, she was a theater queen in the eighties and you know, now it's 40 years

02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:12.820
later.

02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:14.260
So she's up there in age.

02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:19.700
And apparently, um, apparently there's some elder care issues going on there that don't

02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:20.340
sound great.

02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:25.460
And it just, my heart breaks because she is such an icon of the eighties, Edie McClurg.

02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:29.940
If you don't know who Edie McClurg is, Ferris Bueller's day off, she was the secretary

02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:32.180
in that movie with those iconic lines.

02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:38.020
And she was also in that, um, uh, with the Steve Martin, she's the one that Steve Martin

02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:40.500
rants out in planes, trains, and automobiles.

02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:42.900
Like, you know, basically like, fuck you lady type of thing.

02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:45.140
And she just completely fucks him over.

02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.300
Like she, it's an iconic piece of cinema.

02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:48.100
Yep.

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:50.020
DJ Ramesh says Small Wonder.

02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:50.820
Absolutely.

02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:52.820
She was the nosy neighbor in Small Wonder.

02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:53.860
The Hogan family.

02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:55.220
She was famous on that as well.

02:06:55.220 --> 02:07:00.900
And, and Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:04.100
She was the one and only Chastity Pariah.

02:07:04.100 --> 02:07:05.060
Thank you very much.

02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:09.380
If you've never seen Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, fix it.

02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:12.580
An iconic, iconic piece of cinema.

02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:20.260
You won't understand my sexuality unless you watch Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:21.860
I don't know how else to say it.

02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:28.660
No, I have one more thing to say.

02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:33.220
RuPaul was not the first famous drag queen.

02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:36.500
RuPaul was not the first famous drag queen.

02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:40.820
Elvira predates RuPaul.

02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:46.260
Cassandra Peterson, better known as Elvira, 100% a drag queen.

02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:47.540
100%.

02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:52.260
That was a drag performance all of those years and continuing now.

02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:54.660
And the best.

02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:57.220
Where's her reality show?

02:07:57.220 --> 02:07:58.500
Actually, she had a reality show.

02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:00.180
They tried, they did like a next Elvira.

02:08:00.180 --> 02:08:01.060
It wasn't, it wasn't good.

02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:01.780
It was low budget.

02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:02.420
It was not good.

02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:03.300
No, that's too bad.

02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:05.780
All right.

02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:11.220
Anyway, I don't see any calls coming into the green room over at vognetwork.com slash

02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:11.780
Discord.

02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:12.900
The purple room.

02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:14.740
But I will ask quickly.

02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:17.220
TigerClaw says they should do a new Elvira movie.

02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:22.340
They did one later, Elvira's Haunted Hills, because Richard O'Brien, famous from the

02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:24.020
Rocky Horror Picture Show is also in that.

02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:27.220
It's not, not really as iconic.

02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:30.740
It's one of those things, you know, it has a few gags, but it's one of those things

02:08:30.740 --> 02:08:34.660
where it's like you just keep waiting for the, it just doesn't live up to the 80s one.

02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:41.540
I thought I had heard they were going to do one more, but she's, she doesn't like to

02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:42.980
do the character so much anymore.

02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:44.900
You know, she's getting up there in age.

02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:49.540
She doesn't like to, you know, get all put up together for that anymore.

02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:51.700
I don't think she, she loves doing it.

02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:55.140
So she, if you, if you want her to do it, you got to pay her a lot of money.

02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:59.940
By the way, as a new Elvira pinball table has been in my house.

02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:00.420
Yeah.

02:09:00.420 --> 02:09:02.580
Yes, they very much know that it exists.

02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:02.900
Yeah.

02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:03.220
Yeah.

02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:07.060
It's a lovely, lovely piece of technology.

02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:10.260
All right, let's move on.

02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:13.620
Uh, I was going to ask any final, uh, stories tonight.

02:09:13.620 --> 02:09:14.420
Last minute stories.

02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:14.920
Loki.

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:25.220
Uh, I was going to say that this week, um, there there's been some teasing at 2k on

02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:30.980
Twitter saying, uh, you know, they're celebrating the 15th anniversary of bio shock.

02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:36.260
Could we be in for a bio shock announcement at gamescom?

02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:38.500
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:42.100
Um, how about seven 2k games?

02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:42.900
How about seven?

02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:45.620
I'm not sure about that.

02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:46.260
Well, it's about it.

02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:48.100
No, it's about time for civilization seven.

02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:49.300
I'd be down for that.

02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:56.580
There was a, uh, there was kind of a highlight reel that was done by HBO, uh, for HBO now.

02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:58.020
And they deleted it.

02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:00.820
It's deleted.

02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:03.220
It's a joke because of HBO max and everything going on.

02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:03.720
Yeah.

02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:09.160
Yeah, well, yeah, for HBO max, uh, showing off, uh, some of the uncharted series.

02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:14.920
So, or not uncharted last of us getting all the Sony properties mixed up today.

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:15.420
Yeah.

02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:18.040
The last of us TV series.

02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:18.920
Watch it while you can.

02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:24.440
Look to me, they'll, they'll, they'll banish it just like they did Sesame street.

02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:27.960
Who gets rid of Sesame street?

02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:28.680
Who does that?

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:31.880
People that think the Sesame street can't make them money is why.

02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:36.200
People that only look at dollar signs and not, you know, Goodwill.

02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:42.200
This episode was brought to you by the letters F and U and the word discovery.

02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:48.280
Anyway, uh, any other last minute stories to share with us?

02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:50.760
Well, that's pretty much it.

02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:53.000
All right.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.280
Well, uh, I think we will, sorry.

02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:00.520
As the show, one hundred mat says clown show and pod culture says that's an insult to clowns.

02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:01.020
Yes.

02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:03.800
All right.

02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:06.360
Uh, let's wrap it up.

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:08.040
Uh, that is going to be it.

02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:09.720
Uh, let's get to our final thoughts.

02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:12.280
Thank you as always for listening to orange on radio.

02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:15.800
If you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend about the show, uh, help us, uh, spread

02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:18.680
the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices

02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:19.640
to put out on the air.

02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:24.280
So, uh, tell a friend or five, uh, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, uh,

02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:25.320
goes an awful long way.

02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:28.680
Spotify, wherever it is you listen to this show, uh, spread the word.

02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:29.080
Sorry.

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.640
It's not video game news, but something did come up.

02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:32.140
Okay.

02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:36.760
Cole of the cats, Cole and marmalade has passed away.

02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:37.260
Oh.

02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:41.800
Anyway, I didn't mean to bring it all down.

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:43.560
Yeah, way to ruin the mood.

02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:48.920
No, a lot of people follow Cole and marmalade and I just thought I would say something.

02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:50.200
All right.

02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:52.760
Uh, well, you're gonna, here's your chance to make it better.

02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:55.400
Dark Sakura, leave us with a happier final thought tonight.

02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:01.000
Um, uh, I'm gonna play some dead by daylight.

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:02.380
Have fun.

02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:04.440
Enjoy the stabbing.

02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:05.960
Later taters.

02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:06.460
Bye.

02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:07.340
Bye.

02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:09.720
Loki will go to you with your final thought tonight.

02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:14.280
I can't wait to stream my disappointment of the new saints road game.

02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:18.600
Well, hopefully I'll be disappointed, but not a lot of people seem positive about it.

02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:22.360
There's been some gameplay footage that's come out and people aren't happy.

02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:30.840
And my final, my final thought tonight is, um, I, I am really excited for dragon con.

02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:32.040
I want to play that game.

02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:33.480
That's, uh, behind you tonight.

02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:33.880
Loki.

02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:38.520
It's on my list of things to pick up this week is that I may stream that too, but that

02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:39.560
looks really fun.

02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:41.560
You should get on the streaming bandwagon.

02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:42.280
It's fun.

02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:42.920
All right.

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.040
Uh, that's going to do it.

02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:47.560
Thank you so much for, uh, uh, tuning in for another episode of orange launch radio.

02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:49.000
Oh, look, I got to get your final thought.

02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:50.840
Oh no, I did.

02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:51.160
You did.

02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:51.660
I did.

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:53.320
I thought I skipped you.

02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:53.820
Okay.

02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:55.800
I'm really, I'm really burned out.

02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:57.880
Uh, Bob Blackhoof wants to name one more time.

02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:00.120
It's arcade paradise.

02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:00.680
Paradise.

02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:01.320
That's it.

02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:01.560
Okay.

02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.480
Arcade on steam right now.

02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:04.360
And it looks awesome.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.840
Uh, it's turning a laundry mat into an arcade, but like there's many games that you actually

02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:10.680
play of the machines that you install.

02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:18.760
So yeah, the way they describe it, it is, um, a nineties field retro retro arcade adventure

02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:20.760
rather than washing rags for a living.

02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:23.640
You decide to turn your family laundromat into the ultimate arcade.

02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:25.160
There you go.

02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:25.660
Nice.

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:26.520
All right.

02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:28.520
That's going to do it, uh, for another episode of orange.

02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:32.920
We will be back next week, uh, in seven days to do this all over again.

02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:34.600
So I hope you'll join us at that point.

02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:35.640
Have a good week, everybody.

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:36.600
Happy gaming.

02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:37.100
