0	30000	Earlier this year, I was wondering about all the three games Epic has given away that are published by Koch Media. This Koch was spelled K-O-C-H. When I finally looked them up, I learned there was no direct relation to the more infamous American Koch Industries. This confusion is going away, as Koch Media is becoming play-on. Good! This is a positive disambiguation.
30000	37000	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Start your night now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
60000	66000	at the top of the screen right now because I forgot to update it uh but uh and what i'm talking about
66000	70560	of course for those in the podcast feed is the fact that we do tape live every sunday night at
70560	76560	nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network

123760	130000	sitting with me right now of course tech master loki hi loki hello how are you doing i'm doing
130000	135840	fine so this is uh this is one of those newfangled music games playing behind you that uh i've lost
135840	141440	sight of in the years since we no longer were exclusively music games but i should i mean i
141440	146320	always have a soft spot in my heart for music games but i i can't tell which one that is by
146320	150720	you is that the groove coaster that's what it looks like groove goes it is groove coaster
150720	157440	now i wonder does this have to do with the the big news that we got into a couple weeks ago
157440	165120	that finally after all this time that round one in our neighborhood is finally open like i guess
165120	170400	it finally opened yesterday the the round one that was supposed to open in april of 2020 finally
170400	177600	opened yesterday and uh loki did you go i did go i went today i want to know all about it tell me
177600	181840	more how was i know it's probably your gaming week but you know what you can just say minecraft again
181840	188400	for your gaming week i want to hear about the round one experience um so they they have quite
188400	193600	a bit of music games as usual so we went there today wasn't actually too crowded i mean it was
194480	199360	busy i guess i mean it wasn't too bad like the music games there's like no one on them like
199360	208720	hardly ever um when i got there uh ddr ace was broken um already the fuck up it's day two it's
209680	214640	hold on hold on hold on yeah it's day two so there was some issue with the pads or something that
214640	222080	they were tweaking um but it did end up it was working by the end of when i was um like a few
222080	228720	hours later so they did fix it like fast so the ride was just temporarily down i guess yeah but
228800	233360	it opened up later in the day yeah so they have like quite a few games there um
235360	245200	the one the one bemoni game that i was going there to play they don't have which is super annoying so
245200	251280	i went there to play dance rush and they don't have dance rush even though all the round ones
252240	260000	that's weird no instead they have um dance around which looks like hot garbage it's kind of looks
260000	266160	like uh dance evolution a little bit with like um you know motion capturing movements and stuff
266160	273360	like that but it's just eh no they had room for two of those but no dance rush um they had two
273360	281040	2d x machines they had uh gitadora i'm assuming the newest one same with uh so that and the the
281040	289040	drummania version of that um sound voltex um some chrono's thing i don't know there's a lot of
289040	293360	disease they have two beatmania machines i heard they have two beatmania machines one of them is
293360	299680	off one of them is off right now so i don't know if it's working it's day two what is wrong with
299680	304240	roseville actually i was born and raised there i will start to tell you what is wrong with
304880	312000	roseville entitled motherfuckers that is what is wrong with roseville and i would bet some parent
312000	317280	let their teenager kick the machine or something i don't think so i don't think so there's probably
317280	321120	like something maybe in shipping or something i don't know what the issue was but the other
321120	327040	one was working fine um they have groove coasters so that's pretty much i played groove coaster a
327040	331840	few times uh i don't have theater of them huh because i think those started to sunset
331840	335680	yeah that was my favorite thing to play around one but i know yeah they have the online services
335680	341040	got turned off they have some other ones i didn't recognize it sort of looked like para para but you
341840	345840	i don't know if you touch the screen or you do something i don't know it's weird
346400	352480	um and then uh what else so they have their usual stuff they have a little bit of pinball like tiny
352480	358960	tiny bit of pinball they have like fighting games kind of over by the um by the bowling alley so
358960	366800	there's like four lanes there or not four lanes eight lanes there um tons of crane games like a
366800	372240	ton of crane games like a quarter of the building is crane games that's honestly so conquered round
372240	376480	one is like a quarter crane games so i'm not surprised and then another quarter ticket spitters
376480	381840	um yeah yeah it's like the like at least half of it was ticket spitters which is funny because
381840	388800	actually my kids we went there and um so the kids played one of those games where you it's
388800	395040	it's like the strongman games where you like have to hit something and then the light goes up so so
395040	401280	my youngest son he just like drops it and then like immediately gets the jackpot and then my
401280	405200	other son tried it didn't he get the jackpot the first time but then the second time did the exact
405200	412240	same thing and he also got the jackpot so that was funny um and then what else so yeah they had
412240	418000	like a bunch of gun games they had a couple of vr games uh it was a king kong vr game and
420320	426240	um gosh i it looked like it was a i recognized the name but i don't remember
427360	433840	what it was it just looked pretty generic but it was i didn't do it because they said oh you have
433840	439760	to put like these protective it's like a almost like tissue paper for the mass because you don't
439760	443280	want to cove it you don't want to like put you don't want to put your face on like something
443280	448320	that everybody else's face has been on um now monkey pox is also kind of a thing and that is
448320	455200	direct like contact to contact right so that's even more yeah so so they they have i didn't see
455200	461040	those papers there so i was like i'm not gonna do it but when i went over to go check out um
461280	469680	the redemption area which is pretty cool there was a lonely gun bullet x machine so for those
469680	475600	who don't remember gun bullet that's point blank so it's the new one um so i did play that and that
475600	484080	was fun um they have like initial d they have uh daytona was there mario kart they have like a
484160	489440	they have like a rabbids game a giant tomb raider shooter game i've seen that um
490720	495680	like a big buck hunter but it's also got some terminator thing in it so that that's the thing
497120	501120	so it wasn't it but you say it wasn't too crowded why is this sunday it wasn't too bad yeah it
501120	505120	wasn't too bad at all so like i mean i'm gonna i gotta decide if i want to go through through
505120	509280	the week or just wait because shane is going to be in town this weekend and i know he's gonna
509280	513760	want to go so we'll probably end it really wasn't like the balmani stuff there was like
513840	518160	nobody there playing i mean there was people playing some of the other games like they were
518160	523360	playing sound voltex and stuff but like as far as ddr goes there was like one person in front of me
523360	529520	and then i played ddr before we left but it was like really hot in there that was the other thing
529520	537120	too that kind of sucked is like the air conditioner was not keeping up so it was kind of hot in areas
537120	543120	and one of those areas was where all the dance machines were and um that kind of sucked so i
543120	549840	did play ddr and i'm too out of shape to play ddr like i used to i still i know that i mean like i
549840	555040	know i'm out of shape because i don't play enough ddr but of course i jump in the doubles and like
555040	559120	i still don't under because you know super old school when it comes to ddr i don't understand
559120	563920	the new interface and all that yeah not the interface interface fine that that's easy but
563920	568240	like i'm talking about like the difficulties like i don't know what the scale how to translate that
568560	574480	right because now it used to go up to nine maybe 10 at one point and now it's 19 or 20 yeah it
574480	580640	goes up like twice as much it's yeah wild i tried to do the the head math so i played uh i played
580640	587520	clarity once because i i recognize that song i was hoping for give me the uh was it give me a
587520	593360	big beat which is from dance rush because they had that in ddras for a bit i think that was like a
593920	597600	one i don't know how they really do these like different events or whatever but it
597600	604320	wasn't on the machine which is annoying uh but clarity was and then um i think i did like a
604320	610880	the ddr anniversary song i don't really know what what it's called but i did that and it was like
610880	619760	a 13 13 rank thing i was doing doubles so um i was keeping up with it for about three quarters
619760	623680	of the song and then i just did not have the stamina to keep up with it anymore and i was
623680	628480	like oh and then yeah i felt that for a good couple hours after that well somewhere out there
628480	634240	yyr is proud of you for trying so it's fine i have a ddr machine in the garage like i really
634240	640240	i really do need the garage is like really hot but i do need to play it i am very curious because you
640240	645840	know right now my cardio is better in shape than it's been in a long time probably since i used to
645840	651920	play ddr regularly back in the you know 20 years ago in the the heyday of this program um when we
652000	658080	did pretty much play nothing but ddr um i'm in better shape now than i have been since then so
658080	663440	i'm kind of curious how well i might be able to keep up you know i keep thinking i can't do it
663440	668800	because i'm too old but i haven't really tried in the past year since i lost the weight so i don't
668800	673280	know you just have to ease into it is all i mean you can't just jump into like doing the stuff that
673280	677840	you used to be able to do but like i did play groove coaster so i've never really played groove
677840	683360	coaster before i i think maybe i did on the ps vita or something like that i don't remember
683360	687760	they had i thought like groove coaster like on a portable system or maybe i'm thinking of
687760	692640	something else but i don't remember um that was a lot of fun so i played that a few times i played
692640	699760	all the like uh it was a toby scott stuff so megalomania a few times um yeah that was a real
699760	706240	that was really fun i like that game a lot um i did okay on it and then um i don't know i i
706240	710560	wanted to play more but the kids started whining because they went through their cards super fast
710560	716160	whereas i have like 86 points still on my card like there's they're gone yeah like they wanted
716160	722240	to go ruthless that yeah that just what what a day and age we live in when you're the one that
722240	726480	doesn't want to leave the arcade and the kids are like i want to go i want to leave
729440	733360	it's just funny well they they wanted to walk around the mall we were going to go to the lego
733360	737760	store but there's a line to get into the lego store and i'm like i don't want to they only
737760	743600	let so many people in at a time yeah like i just i don't want to wait for it like all i was going
743600	747360	to do is look at stuff and possibly buy something like if i'm going to buy something i was buying
747360	752000	through the website like honestly i just i just wanted to look they have the new princess peach
752000	758160	stuff there now so that's cool for the lego mario stuff but i just i don't want to wait in line and
758160	762080	then everything else like we went to the candy store and we bought some japanese candy but like
762560	768400	that's it did you notice how many like import stores there are in the mall now like anime
768400	773840	figures and uh maybe that's more art and fair than the galleria but i know i've seen a couple
773840	779280	of them at galleria no i didn't really uh walk through that too much but in like the kids area
779280	785040	they have a bunch of arcade games lined along the wall oh yeah um free play uh free play but like
785040	791600	i'm like i don't think that's legal they have like multi-carts in there and stuff but whatever i mean
791680	797440	it's fine um one of them looked like a one-up arcade one-up machine that may be someone modded
797440	803280	uh but yeah i would totally go back to round one i mean it was fun i just wish they had dance rush
803280	808240	because that's the only reason i've been waiting so long to play that i haven't gotten a chance to
808240	813760	go to a round one and like that's that's the only place i know that has that game i was gonna say i
813760	820080	think they have one in conquered if you can make the you know how to drive the drive yeah yeah so
820800	825920	yeah all right whatever well let's say hello to our chatters of course uh over at twitch.tv slash
825920	832240	vog network and uh jason our favorite voiceover guy says uh suggests instead of translating
832240	837360	difficulties go find songs you know well and see what their new difficulty is yeah because
837360	841440	i know it's not like like you can't just say oh because it's on a scale to 20 now then
841440	845600	uh a nine is double it's an 18 and no no it doesn't work like that like a lot of the nines
845600	851200	i used to be able to beat are like 11 and 12 like max like it's it's uh different now the scale is
851200	856080	very different from what i remember anyway it's been a little bit since i i looked at it um let's
856080	862160	see uh other comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network uh dgrms suggests we need a new
862160	867920	punching mania that got into a little bit of discussion about one punch uh mania uh let's see
867920	873040	uh dr cia talking about uh roseville stories because i mentioned uh that you know the machines
873040	877680	were probably breaking in roseville because of the people that live there uh saying yeah i know
877680	881520	i have a laundry list of horror stories from roseville golf land i could tell my wife yeah
881520	887360	what's so it it seemed like like honestly like i think they're really on top of it and the staff
887360	892400	i think that work there to repair the machines are like some of the community people and like the
892400	899120	repair like it's day two they're still happy to be there right right no i get that and there was
899120	902720	there was like there was someone working on the machine like right when i got there like and they
903680	907360	i think there was like a sensor out or something like that and so they are testing that and
907360	913440	it didn't take long for them to have it fixed it's just um it's kind of annoying but you know they
913440	918800	i saw the maintenance people come by like a ton throughout the day so like they were making sure
918800	924400	everything was working and all that um i mean there's there's plenty to do there that's for
924400	930000	sure there's like a ton of games to play i not i don't know about the crane games but there are
930000	934560	some people man like i would i was walking by a few of the tables where like they just had
934560	940320	all of the plushies like all of them like i'm like what how many crane games did you play
940960	947600	but it was busy yeah all right um let's see uh i wanted to see some other comments here uh she
947600	953600	hulk says need ddr for senior gamers well it's funny because last week i remember the tweet that
953600	960400	came in that said uh the kids last playable ddr kids machine was going away uh but once in a while
960400	964720	you still see like a fourth mix plus or a ddr extreme because those were everywhere you see
964720	968880	a ddr extreme in the wild somewhere and that's that's kind of the machine for seniors i think
968880	974000	at this point at least for i thought for sure they would have like a step maniacs there or
974000	979600	something like that but i know there's one in the rockland bowling alley but i i don't know there
980400	986240	so there's a lot of games now like i'm surprised how many like mobile games are arcade games now
986240	994160	like even racing games and stuff but i don't know it's fine all right uh well i'm excited to head
994160	997840	over there i'm hoping i can get there over there this week i'll just probably play nothing but 2dx
997840	1002240	to be honest um unless there's a big crowd because then i don't i don't like people watching me play
1002240	1008800	as i i because i i know i'm not great at it and i'm just like i'd rather play like judgment free
1008800	1014000	but oh well i guess i just need to get the hell over it it's back in the corner and it's not
1014000	1017920	really facing anything it's like it's facing the corner so it's kind of where it is you're not
1017920	1022320	really gonna yeah you're not really gonna it's not like in the high traffic area or anything
1022320	1027680	and pump it up is and pump it up like i almost played that i'm like i really want to play pump
1027680	1035040	it up though um but the pump it up machine looks really nice um and i don't know like
1035760	1042000	and stuff like i i i'm so old school that i can't do the i can't do the five button fret stuff like
1042000	1050240	so it's i'm i can only do three and i could barely do three when i'm a guitar freak so i don't know i
1050240	1054400	don't even keep up with those games anymore so i have no idea what songs would be on there and then
1054400	1062480	uh 2dx like i almost play 2dx but also not very good at that all right and then uh dance around
1062480	1070720	like i don't know i know i'm actually you know it's it's fine that i didn't go this weekend well
1070720	1074480	i had other plans this weekend so i went to a concert last night i went to the bay area so i
1074480	1080080	saw i actually saw so speaking of like old school ddr friend of the show mel b who did freestyle
1080080	1083360	back in the day right like we're still we still keep in touch i'm really good friends with his
1083360	1089600	wife and so um we all went to go see elana smores set in the bay yes i've seen her like i think that
1089600	1094880	was probably my 11th time in concert i don't know i've lost count but uh went to the bay area to uh
1094880	1100880	see all that so i'm like super exhausted from that trip um i also i got the monkey pox vaccine on
1100880	1106320	friday and that like the side effects for the covet shot was probably worse for me where as far as
1106320	1112160	like you know having the sore arm and everything but i just feel like really like i don't want to
1112160	1115760	say fatigue but i just feel tired i'm just tired and i think that's probably what i'm feeling out
1115760	1123360	of that so this wouldn't have been a good weekend to go play ddr anyway for a variety of reasons so
1123920	1127440	next weekend ought to be a little bit better i think we'll be uh we'll be good for that
1128000	1135360	um let's see i guess in chat they're talking about a ddr vr type of setup and as somebody said
1135360	1140800	uh that's a great way to uh jason says that's a great way to break a vr headset yeah it might be
1140800	1146400	a little a little too much motion unless you know it was on google glasses or something like that
1146400	1151280	where you don't have a bunch of stuff to run it i don't know he'd still he's still run right into
1151280	1158000	things unless the ddr was a pass through camera or something sounds pretty dangerous all right well
1158000	1164720	let's get into our kickoff topic tonight i i didn't intend to talk about round one but i once i kind
1164720	1168480	of got clued in that loki went because you tweeted something about the dance media machine i was like
1168480	1173440	oh he either read that in a group or he went so i wanted to know more about it since i didn't get
1173440	1179520	to go so thanks for sharing and how exciting we finally have uh some of those import games that
1179520	1185040	we used to love from years and years ago back in the area so it's it's nice so it is nice yeah
1185040	1188800	yeah all right let's talk about our kickoff topic tonight you want to do this loki or
1189680	1196800	sure uh so logitech and tencent are making a cloud gaming handheld device um they said
1196880	1202960	they're also working with uh xbox cloud gaming and nvidia geforce now on the device
1203920	1211840	which will arrive apparently this year and it's uh yeah they're partnering with logitech
1211840	1220240	g which i guess is their gaming division to bring a cloud gaming handheld to the market and
1220800	1228160	and i'm not really sure what's going to be on it aside from what they kind of mentioned if they're
1228160	1233440	going to also have like their own tencent like say marketplace or something but at least it's
1233440	1240640	cool that it supports like you know xbox game cloud and geforce now stuff so at the very least
1240640	1246480	you'll be able to use some of your games but i mean is this just like another steam deck
1246480	1252320	uh well no because it's cloud gaming right so it's not going to have the oomph in it that a
1252320	1258240	steam deck has this is going to be probably a relatively cheap piece of technology i don't mean
1258240	1263200	that to sound shady that's not my point there but i think it's probably going to be a relatively
1263200	1269760	cheap piece of technology when all is said and done um so but we'll we'll we'll see i guess um
1270400	1276320	i think this kind of begs the question though if it's needed because like i feel like a cloud
1276320	1285200	gaming system like it would be cool if like we had enough 5g in the world where you could play
1285200	1290480	cloud gaming anywhere but right now seems a little early for something that's like strictly dedicated
1290480	1295120	cloud gaming but i don't know then again the switch maybe is the model for that even within
1295120	1299040	your own home those things can still be very popular because certainly you know home wi-fis
1299040	1304880	can support that type of stuff so i don't know anyway uh let me quickly acknowledge hello dark
1304880	1312880	sakura or jamie summer is uh joining us tonight how are you doing oh a sore throat oh oh i'm sorry
1312880	1318640	uh i was gonna ask um how well i'll come to your i'll loop back to your gaming weekend a little bit
1318640	1325040	um but going back to the topic of the um cloud gaming console the question i kind of want to ask
1325040	1331680	for for you and and for chat is is this something that we need right now this feels i don't i don't
1331680	1337440	know if this feels too early or if this feels too late i feel like it's too early in the sense that
1337440	1343280	you know if we had 5g and we had ways to play cloud gaming a little more reliably you know
1343280	1349600	over the air anywhere you go i think something like this could be pretty cool but i also kind
1349600	1356000	of think like it might be a little late because i mean cloud gaming applications already exist for
1356000	1361520	phones right like you can do cloud gaming on your phone and now most iphones and androids will
1361520	1366080	connect with the biggest um you know you want to connect to playstation controller xbox you can
1366080	1371360	kind of do that on all these and you know even with the the rules in the apple marketplace all
1371360	1377840	the cloud gaming systems uh figured out how to do a safari based uh uh product so cloud gaming
1377920	1386240	exists on mobile so i'm not sure where this need sort of is needed um
1388000	1396160	well being that's tencent maybe china maybe that's why they're trying to push you know gaming there
1396160	1403120	um but then you know you have the great you know firewall of china so i don't know how that
1403120	1412160	necessarily factors into everything but um yeah i don't see a real need for that like cloud gaming
1412160	1421600	is nice and all but like how much money are you really gonna pay to do all that like i don't know
1421600	1426400	i just don't think we have the infrastructure for it i just it'd be a hard sell to have to see what
1427200	1433920	how much that's gonna be and like really visit entice because you're really kind of
1433920	1440720	reliant on those other services and stuff to play that stuff so i don't know and it's a lot
1440720	1446400	of cost and so you know a lot of cost involved with it i do think it's neat that they have
1446400	1450640	different cloud services on it because they're talking about what they're talking about um g
1450640	1456880	force that one they have microsoft's cloud system and this would make it indicate that if like
1456880	1461760	stadia luna you know whatever else is out there wanted to get on board they could
1461760	1465680	so that part of it's kind of interesting it actually makes me think of kind of like a tablet
1465680	1471600	almost where you have like different apps on it uh and then you know would lead to these different
1471600	1480240	cloud services so i i wonder if maybe if this cloud gaming handheld had netflix hulu paramount
1480240	1485680	and so forth if maybe it wouldn't be a good device for kid entertainment you know something
1485680	1492160	to kind of hand the kids to keep them busy i like but see the thing is though is like if
1493040	1497680	if you're trying to make that argument of like well we need a handheld for the kids
1498320	1504080	you're just gonna give them a switch like honestly like cost wise unless they get it way under the
1504080	1508960	price of a switch you're just gonna get them a switch because it's got kids games on there
1508960	1515440	it's a reliable system it doesn't require internet because if you have like if you are
1515440	1522320	going to do cloud gaming um legitimately like actually away from wi-fi then you're gonna have
1522320	1529040	to pay for internet access so you're gonna have to be on some sort of data plan um you hopefully
1529040	1533280	have strong enough connection to be able to play on that stuff and like what's it going to look
1533280	1539040	like on this constantly it may not be you may have latency issues i mean there's a lot of
1539040	1545600	things involved with it but i think if if given the choice if like a family was picking out a
1545600	1549120	game system for their kid they're gonna get a switch because they're not gonna understand
1549120	1556320	what cloud gaming means like it's it's a hard sell yeah i mean again i see the potential in
1556320	1562240	cloud gaming and you know certainly um we're you know seeing just more and more of it through
1562240	1566960	especially you know now microsoft launching it you know jamie's talked a lot about stadia and
1566960	1571680	how that's been very useful for her we see luna's making more and more of a push so you know cloud
1571680	1578000	gaming is is is growing uh heck even not to not to get too far into my gaming week but i actually
1578000	1583600	found that i was i i loaded up the playstation player on my computer and basically did remote
1583600	1590240	play on my playstation which i guess isn't really cloud gaming because it's all within my own house
1590800	1597600	but uh it's it feels similar to me and i like that whole idea of the remote play and so forth
1597600	1602560	and being able to access a device from multiple screens within your house you know what i mean
1602560	1606880	and i think and zen monkey 11 is pointing out that's not cloud gaming i know but it's still
1606880	1613520	that idea of being able to have something touch multiple screens in your house that you own
1613520	1619360	um is is kind of the the thought there and i have found that to be very useful so i think there is
1619440	1623760	a lot of great cases for cloud gaming and i do think it's i think it's going to get bigger
1624320	1631840	um but again i don't i don't know if um i don't know if this device is is enough uh i see
1631840	1639680	comparison would be if um say that i was actually this happened i was at marissa's house
1640240	1644640	and i needed to log into my dead by daylight account to get like my my blood points or
1644640	1652320	whatever it was if i had had the right controller with me i could have turned on my phone logged
1652320	1658400	into my stadia account and logged into the game long enough to get my blood points sadly we
1658400	1666560	couldn't get the right controller to pair no but that is cloud gaming that is a also a very modern
1666560	1672640	example of what we all used to do when we were younger which was taking the cartridge over to
1672640	1678800	a friend's house to play uh when you go like you know i don't but it's well because it's like oh
1678800	1684320	i'm taking my cloud account and signing into your tv and we're playing my games no that's not it at
1684320	1691600	all because my friends i could have been in a hotel room with no tv whatsoever i had my phone
1691600	1698080	that is what cloud gaming is for i could log in on my iphone my ipad and another computer
1698080	1704400	most at the same time if i wanted to that's what cloud gaming is for it's not the same as bringing
1704400	1708320	a cartridge over to somebody's house and using their tv you're not letting someone else log into
1708320	1712880	your account you're doing this for yourself and you don't have to rely on anybody else just study
1712880	1720160	internet i i sort of feel like what i said can count too but okay um it would be it wouldn't be
1720160	1724800	for anyone else to see something that i'm doing it solely for my play because it's on my devices
1724800	1735600	all right so um loki um any anything else about this handheld or is there any uh hint on when we
1735600	1740960	might get more information on this no no hint yet on when we're gonna see more information but it
1740960	1746000	is supposed to be out later this year so i would imagine probably pretty soon all right maybe maybe
1746000	1751840	just in time for the holidays who knows maybe we'll see all right let's get into our gaming
1751840	1756480	weeks and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week uh so loki we've
1756480	1760720	already had pretty much a good rundown of your round one but i'll cycle back to you in a minute
1760720	1764320	to talk about anything else at home you might have played but let's go over to dark sakura how was
1764320	1774480	your gaming week i um of course played dead by daylight i um i played my word game i played final
1774480	1781920	fantasy 6 and i did the good playthrough for spirit on hooked on you the dead by daylight
1781920	1790880	dating sim spirit is obviously the best one of them the trapper is a dick i think i'm gonna go
1790880	1799120	for huntress next but the spirits playthrough actually was really awesome and she's that
1799120	1806320	version of her is probably my favorite depiction so far is the game long or is it kind of just
1806320	1812320	like short and sweet it was i don't know i think i was playing for a couple hours okay it's longer
1812320	1818880	than i would have thought um well also i suck at the mini games so i did my usual mini game thing
1818880	1825760	which is once i got you know the desired out outcome i saved my game and if i failed the
1825760	1831680	next time i would reload my game so that i'm still no good at it i think because i'm playing
1831680	1838480	through my virtualizer um i'm playing through parallels on windows 11 arm i do have some input
1838480	1848880	lag so in my case it was sort of necessary um but no it's a cute game um i really enjoyed it uh
1849200	1857600	uh there was uh there's definitely big nods back to the original it almost seems like it's a
1857600	1866400	slightly different continuity um which i'm down for but but definitely has that sort of you could
1866400	1872480	die at any moment feel because you know the person that you're trying to to woo could just go and do
1872480	1882080	a snit and kill you but um i've heard i've heard very mixed things on it you know so nothing but
1882080	1886080	good from people so i could link you to some articles that kind of dog on it and say it's
1886080	1891840	really well articles are one thing i believe in my friends opinions and my friends that i've seen
1891840	1896720	play it have all just thought it was really cute i guess it's really what the fans think at the end
1896720	1901120	of the day it's like movies i guess it's really what the fans exactly i don't care what what some
1901120	1905920	critic or reviewer says about something i would rather see what my friends opinions are because
1905920	1912160	i trust them above you some complete stranger who might even be paid to give a negative review i
1912160	1917600	don't know all right well if there's nothing else for your gaming week loki how was your gaming week
1918400	1924160	um aside from round one it was just minecraft so i put out a new episode and i saw that
1925040	1932400	yeah cool all right what's that what's the new episode about it is building a shop on the server
1932400	1940080	so i themed it after a robot repair shop so it's kind of an old um like desert garage gas station
1940080	1946320	that's been converted over to repair robots and so there's like this giant creeper bot in the front
1946320	1951200	there's a like a rocket fist it's like crashing into the ground and a bunch of like robots just
1952160	1960080	broken all over the place all right i'll check it out yep all right uh see my gaming week uh so i
1960080	1965440	mentioned my weekend was pretty busy um and honestly during the week it was a lot of the same
1965440	1970560	stuff i've kind of yeah i had a had a loki minecraft type of week but for me it's uh final
1970560	1976400	fantasy 14 uh but there's a limited time event going on for cosmetics in that game so it's really
1976720	1981840	kind of motivated me to run certain stuff over and over in that game um i've been playing a little
1981840	1991280	bit of um um oh my gosh why is it escaping oh no man's sky my gosh my brain um i uh because of the
1991280	1997200	expedition uh which is moving a lot faster than the prior ones um but i haven't really sunk the
1997200	2002160	number of hours into it either that i did the other ones i feel like i put a lot of hours into
2002160	2006480	it when i was streaming it during the twitch drop campaign and now i'm kind of focused on other
2006480	2011360	stuff i just i need to cycle back and finish up this expedition but um what i've what i've been
2011360	2015600	playing of it so far i enjoy um i've also been playing a little bit of dead by daylight which
2015600	2019680	i just i've just kind of been into it i don't know if it's the rework or the changes but i've just
2019680	2024640	been kind of motivated to try to get some more characters leveled um i just finally prestige
2024640	2029520	claudette for the first time today because i really wanted botany on all my peeps um so now
2029520	2035440	i've got that and so now i'm trying to decide do i work with like a min max character that i really
2035440	2040400	like like a cheryl or chris for me are probably my highest level um characters or do i kind of
2040400	2045760	try to go through everybody and get all the basics unlocked i i don't know i'm getting ready to to
2045760	2052800	prestige fang yeah but nia is still my main um yeah yeah and that's the thing it's like it's
2052800	2058720	like chris is probably my main but yet i have more points on cheryl because i chose to p3 her
2058800	2064080	uh back earlier so it's it but yet i have more talents i have like everything i have unlocked
2064080	2067840	i have purple on chris i don't quite have that with cheryl yet but i'll get there it's just
2067840	2072320	playing more matches they've also had one of those blood rush events this weekend which means that
2072320	2076480	you get more blood points from doing matches and the blood points how you get abilities yeah so
2076480	2082560	that's that's been a big motivation for me to play because i'm like okay it didn't take me that long
2082560	2086240	all things considered to level claudette especially because survivor queues have been so
2086240	2091120	much faster since the reworks because more people want to play killer because um just you know it's
2091120	2095440	uh either however you look at it it's more balanced or there's just and they're camping
2095440	2102480	and tunneling a lot more oh girl the ma i tried to do some matches right before bobby because it
2102480	2107280	was right when i was um trying to prestige claudette literally back to back i had one of
2107280	2111600	those tier three mires which isn't really camping but it's just frustrating when it's like oh it's
2111600	2117360	over in five seconds yeah he got his final tier three on me and now i'm dead and i got to do
2117360	2122800	nothing but do one generator it's just silly um and then uh i hate i hate that item i wish they'd
2122800	2129520	take it out um and then um i honestly never used it as my ears i tried to use it two times and
2129520	2138240	hated it yeah um and then uh um i had a plague which is interesting because i've actually been
2138240	2144000	playing a lot of plague lately like even more than sadako um i just really enjoy playing
2144000	2151520	plague like i think she has a neat mechanic that most yeah most of the survivor kind of meta right
2151520	2157040	now doesn't really address plague and i noticed certain talents like the healing talents like
2157040	2163040	self-care is wasted on a plague so it's it's kind of neat to break a lot of the meta in that sort of
2163040	2169920	way um but you know you're still pretty vicious i got my just desserts because i went up against
2169920	2176960	a plague who decided to uh target me first then camp the hook until i went into second state and
2176960	2184080	then of course as soon as i got unhooked hooked me again so i and i was just like i i i wish there
2184080	2190160	was something retaliatory you could do when it's three hooks in a row like on you you can block
2190160	2198720	that player oh i always do but i've been actually every time i leave a negative review on them
2198720	2207760	i put a note do better like to behavior to one of their people reading the the complaint because
2207760	2214240	i'm using that as sort of a half feedback forum as well as keeping a running tally because i'm
2214240	2221120	actually gonna start keeping a tally of how many uh matches i have out of how many and email them
2221120	2228160	a fucking spreadsheet one thing i like about vhs uh or video horror society which i can't play
2228160	2232400	whatever you want to call it the the 4v1 and a lot of people are comparing it to dead by daylight
2232400	2237600	because it's 4v1 and involves killers and survivors but the games do have pretty different
2237600	2244000	mechanics when you when you watch it but one thing i like about vhs is that when you're dead
2244000	2249040	there's still things you can kind of do in the spirit realm to help revive yourself faster and
2249040	2255040	i kind of wish dead by daylight had something where like if i get tunneled out that fast or
2255040	2259760	you know that there was something i could do to still help the remaining survivors and still have
2259760	2264880	a game to play i don't know what that is but i just i just kind of wish it wasn't like well
2264880	2269360	congrats the killer decided to knock you out first and you just wasted your time you know it does
2269360	2274640	work when you're in a at least a two player swift and the other person is still in the game when
2274640	2281200	you're on discord chat because that's true you can spy on the other players yeah well like when
2281200	2286320	i was last one left in the game um gwen was watching the other players for me and telling
2286320	2292720	me where they were and where the killer was and so that was where i shouldn't be and it worked out
2293360	2297520	really well for the most part um except i was finally like dude just come get me i know you
2297520	2302880	need a 4k for some reason because like he it was a race that let me boop him i've been trying to
2302880	2308000	boop all the killers now for the record and he let me boop him and then he shook his head i'm
2308000	2313440	like okay and he let me sneak by and start to run and you know he gave me a head start he even left
2313440	2319760	me you know on the ground a couple of times you know i think he was saving me for last but but
2319760	2326640	you know he communicated that no he wanted to play seriously and he didn't camp or tunnel or anything
2327360	2335600	but um but at any rate you know one's like he's gonna see you i'm like i know i'm gonna let him
2335600	2342480	get me and i did the come on move and let him get me um because i had i had done whatever i
2342480	2346640	needed to do in that match because i've mostly been focusing on challenges my thing for winning
2346640	2355440	me i was did i get my challenge done um but it's been interesting that if you have those players
2355440	2362000	like that every so often you can make friends with them and they will tunnel and camp everybody
2362000	2368480	else out of the game and give you the hatch it oh i was just saying it is interesting that you say
2368480	2372320	the game for you right now is the challenges because the one thing i will give that plague
2372320	2377520	match is that i had that um thing in the tome right now where you have to fall off from a great
2377520	2382800	height like three times i don't think it's in one match but but i happen to be actually it was in
2382800	2386880	one match okay no not in one match it was multiple matches because i did that one too
2386880	2392640	i happen to be on that map um and now the name of the map the name of it escapes me now it's it's
2392640	2400160	oni's map that's temple yeah yeah it's with the big thing in the middle and so i was trying okay
2400160	2405200	i was able to fall i was able to fall off of that over and over again while i was being chased so i
2405200	2412160	got my challenge done i did one of mine with a spirit where i waited on top of the hill waited
2412160	2417120	for the chase music to start and jumped off the hill and then we had a farming hag of all things
2418240	2423760	who um you know basically i fast vaulted to let her know i was ready to do my challenge
2424400	2430400	she ran up uh music kicked in i ran off balcony and jumped off and did that twice and got my
2430400	2436720	challenge done that way but that's always the the kind of fun thing oh and we we tried doing that
2436720	2442720	against because i had it another time we tried to do that against a uh a gun daddy and that was
2442720	2448960	interesting he wasn't having it um just to quickly jump back here before we get into the news tonight
2448960	2453520	um our one of our chatters here questbusters is uh elaborating on no man's sky in the current
2453520	2458320	expedition saying this no man's sky expedition felt more accessible than the last one to me
2458320	2462640	some milestones seemed easier to hit out of order than the others were like scanning plants or
2462640	2467360	animals the expedition also feels like a really good point to start no man's sky fresh if you
2467360	2471760	wanted to since you end up with a big freighter and most of the major upgrades on finishing it
2471760	2476560	um yeah that is i will agree this um this particular expedition is doing a really good
2476560	2482240	job showing the changes to the patch which are freighters i really like the twist uh that you
2482240	2487120	start on the freighter as opposed to starting on a planet and i think also questbuster when
2487120	2492000	you talk about it's more accessible than the last one it's because the emphasis now is not
2492000	2497680	on the combat as it was in the last couple because of the recent patches and like you know our own
2497680	2502720	bobby blackwolf here is is openly expressed that he was super into no man's sky but when the game
2502720	2507360	was really shoving combat at you over and over again he started to lose interest in it because
2507360	2511360	you know sometimes you want a chill exploration game and you don't want to be swarmed by pirates
2511360	2515760	every five minutes and i get that but i will say my experience with the expedition so far is that
2515760	2521120	the pirate thing is is minimized it's still there but it's not like none of the achievements are for
2521120	2526800	fighting pirates from what i recall and they don't seem to be attacking the freighter which is really
2526800	2531280	your base of operations in this so it it did take the emphasis off of that and i think that's
2531280	2535600	maybe what led to those feelings about it's a little more accessible than the prior ones
2535600	2540880	because that rando roguelike one they just did that's the worst expedition that game's ever done
2540880	2546000	that that roguelike twist was was terrible it didn't work right in that game that's not what
2546000	2550800	that game is set up for you know i love that game but i'm gonna call a game out when it makes
2550800	2557680	missteps and that was a misstep so um you know uh but uh i'm glad they're they've course corrected
2557680	2565440	literally and this this new expedition is pretty good so far so all right um let's move on to some
2565440	2570640	news and uh we'll get to that and then of course your calls your emails and all that good stuff
2570640	2577600	later on in the show but let's start with some news loki all right so you know if the topic is
2577600	2584240	going to be about game stop and nfts it's only positive information i'm i'm sure that's what no
2584240	2594160	no no uh so apparently uh there's been some nfts being sold that they didn't have the permission
2594160	2603040	to use the artwork for allegedly um so there was i mean this is aside from earlier when they had a
2603360	2610880	uh artwork of a person falling to the death on 9 11 so that that that was how this whole like nft
2610880	2620400	marketplace started um but now apparently though they've been borrowing artwork i guess um so this
2620400	2628880	is part actually it's even more than artwork it's actual games itself so this is elo's nifty arcade
2628880	2635280	it's supposed to be where you can have a fully playable version of the game in your crypto wallet
2636000	2646720	it it links to uh these html5 games um but you know i'm not sure if these folks had
2647520	2653360	permission to use those so um some of the games of course they they have in there like uh this
2653360	2661440	game worm nom nom which was on uh itch.io and they have a creative commerce or creative commons
2661440	2666880	license for it that doesn't allow commercial use and that was one of the ones that was featured
2666880	2676880	in this nft collection there was another one um apparently there's a game developed by christian
2677520	2686080	majewski and it was a game called breakout hero it said it was um his work was sold for profit
2686080	2695280	without my consent so yeah it's like the wild west except you know it's a bunch of garbage because
2695280	2701200	this nft and it's even worse now because it's stolen ip stuff which is not the first trust me
2701200	2708480	like i nfts have stolen all sorts of ip stuff this whole thing just plays right into the hand
2708480	2713360	that i have been saying what many people have been saying is the big problem with nfts and
2713360	2719920	it just it's a it's a bunch of fucking crooks that are involved i know that is very harsh but
2720560	2727120	you know what with stories like this every single day when it comes to some sort of artwork
2727120	2733040	y'all get to own it nft community gets to own it game stop and their marketplace get to own it
2733040	2742080	y'all are well they are not even owning it they're their marketplace has basically this um terms of
2742080	2746800	service that says you are solely responsible for conducting research on an nft as well as
2746800	2751920	understanding the sellers terms and conditions i i think someone should take to test that and
2751920	2756720	take game stop the corridor over it i don't think game stop can can willfully claim ignorance that
2756720	2762320	easy i i think if they put it on their shelf that whether it be their virtual shelf or whatever
2762320	2767040	they need to own a little bit of that and you know what i'm not a legal expert i'm an angry gamer on
2767040	2770720	the internet whatever maybe i don't know what the fuck i'm talking about that's fine at least i can
2770720	2778000	admit that well the one of the guys that did it so um there was one of the games um that was on
2778000	2785520	there that he filed a dmca request with game stop but it just hasn't really gone anywhere
2786720	2792800	and games game stop should be in a courtroom over it like that that's that's how i feel
2793440	2799200	changed my mind uh i i just gave stop game stop needs to own that if they're not going to bother
2799200	2804880	to screen any of this stuff then i think they're going to need to own it um you know and i i know
2804880	2810240	i know we could get into the whole thing about well do facebook and twitter own all the things
2810240	2815280	that are you know published by users on their platform well you know twitter doesn't make
2815280	2822720	money directly off of they don't take a 30 cut of selling your tweet nfts will take cuts of selling
2822720	2827600	your tweets it's it's a very different type of thing uh from from where i'm sitting especially
2827600	2833200	in this you know game stop thing where they're selling games and that's that's the other thing
2833200	2838080	and i think that's where it would stand up in court game stop is selling games they don't have
2838080	2843920	the right to sell and i think there's a lot of courts that are gonna not understand this nft
2843920	2849680	thing and it's it's i don't know i i just think game stop could get in a lot of trouble for this
2849680	2857120	but what do i know angry gamer with the podcast yep all right i'd say good luck to him but um
2857120	2863760	that wouldn't be truthful so let's move on to our next story uh let's talk about oh let's talk
2863760	2872880	about countries banning things uh and that would be uh indonesia has actually banned uh some online
2872880	2879040	stores uh they have banned things like steam and epic games although there is a follow-up um and
2879040	2885360	i'll get to get to that in a minute um so what happened is that um and of course now i can't
2886000	2892480	read this story because this website is putting up a thing that i can't get past all right um so
2892480	2898160	these blocks apparently that indonesia was doing was affecting sites like yahoo and paypal and it's
2898160	2904240	because it's not a content thing it's because they did not comply with a requirement related
2904240	2911280	to content moderation laws how about that in indonesia and they didn't reply to it in a timely
2911280	2918000	manner so they got blocked now valve and steam have uh since this news originally came out they
2918000	2924480	got registered and so uh the the site is called com info um so they're no longer blocked by the
2924480	2930880	government and i guess paypal and yahoo they are also back online but epic game store ea's origin
2930880	2937360	they are still blocked at this time and there's no uh word on when they're coming back or if they
2937360	2943280	even plan to register i wonder if indonesia has blocked the game stop nft store i would i would
2943280	2948080	imagine to be serious the store probably doesn't exist um in that country yet they probably only
2948080	2956320	launched it in so many uh areas so anyway 191 million people on the internet uh in indonesia
2956320	2963360	that are affected by this so uh let's see fifth dream in chat says oh i was in a stream with a
2963360	2969120	couple of indonesian chatters who were just suddenly cut off from all their games man oh
2969120	2976000	that's a really good type of like reality with this too is that if steam gets blocked i believe
2976000	2981280	you would not have access to your games because the server can't check your ownership of the
2981280	2987280	games because steam is blocked and steam did not hit the kill switch which we all know is built
2987280	2992080	into steam that if they ever have to close it down one day you will not have to check with the steam
2992080	2995280	servers anymore because the kill switch will have been activated but that wasn't activated in
2995280	3001280	indonesia the government put a wall down so that is a very interesting sort of uh thought in this
3001280	3006160	whole thing is that if they bought games on epic game store or steam or any of that stuff you shit
3006160	3013120	out of luck the government's blocked you from it so all over a registration thing but it's
3013120	3018640	interesting uh pele hanumea says would a vpn get around that i think that's what a lot of people
3018640	3025520	do in places like china and so forth but although then those countries try to screen for the vpn
3025520	3032000	stuff and i believe it's it's pretty illegal too um but i i think and i'm not a super techy person
3032000	3037760	but i think it's kind of hard to catch um i think that's also what's happening with a lot of the um
3039520	3044480	sanctions in russia right now i think there's a lot of russian users that are using vpn
3044480	3051440	to you know scoot their way around it however so um that's just an interesting technological thing
3051520	3058080	that uh exists so yeah nothing can truly be blocked when there's those types of technological
3058080	3064640	things to get around it all right uh moving on let's go to dark sakura with a with a mainstream
3064640	3071360	news story but what about the industry yeah and it honestly isn't too much of a surprise um but
3071360	3078800	the video game industry is taking a hit in revenue right now um part of it having to do well especially
3078800	3087680	in the us but uh part of it having to do with uh inflation rising to a 40-year high um people are
3087680	3095120	spending less money and we have a slower labor market um the video game industry has been called
3095120	3102960	recession proof but that isn't the case anymore um nintendo microsoft sony um they all reported
3102960	3108480	declining revenue and missed earnings expectations in the past two weeks they say that the big reason
3108480	3116000	is a weakened supply chain and still being affected by a pandemic related lockdown also um
3116000	3120720	they have trouble delivering their consoles because i know that there was due to the lockdown
3120720	3131920	in shanghai there uh was that uh microconductor shortage that was going on um their uh
3132880	3139840	activision reported that their mobile games were thriving even though uh their
3140480	3147200	like mainstream games especially the call of duty franchise was experiencing big setbacks um and
3147200	3156400	also um there there's uh microsoft was especially having some issues because of their acquisition of
3156400	3163680	of uh bungee and uh and uh you know other companies that they've acquired
3165360	3173120	and having to deal with making adjustments for the acquisition um definitely uh accounted for
3173120	3184320	some of their loss nintendo um reported that their profit was uh 101.7 billion yen which is about 764
3184320	3193360	million and they fell short of their expectations by 13.5 billion yen um their uh switch sales
3193360	3205280	declined uh from uh about you know 4.5 million units to 3.43 million now um software sales
3205280	3214960	dropped uh maybe by about uh 4 million since last year but they are also um you know again
3214960	3220160	contributing this to supply chain issues and said that they should catch up over the summer um
3221200	3226880	they're thinking that by next fiscal year ending in april that they'll sell 21 million console units
3227680	3234160	that still remains to be seen even sony in japan um is uh dropped uh about 25 percent
3235040	3243360	um uh selling fewer ps4 and ps5 titles um and uh their chief financial officer
3243360	3249360	uh totoki hiroki the main issues was meeting demand for consoles with supply chain issues again
3250320	3259120	um and also that this financial year they have released fewer large games in comparison to last
3259120	3270720	year um and uh he did not say if sony was planning on raising the price of the ps5 um but he also
3270720	3276160	said the drop in game software sales to people having more chances to leave their homes with the
3276720	3286160	the decreased severity of covid that uh people are venturing back out again and again he said
3286160	3291840	he mentioned like i said earlier uh the lockdown in shanghai uh for the semiconductor parts that
3291840	3299280	were being manufactured um back i'm sorry i meant sony not microsoft with bungee it's uh bungee and
3299280	3305360	haven studios um they said that the earlier than expected closing of the bungee deal with a weaker
3305360	3315920	yen also affected their uh their sales um now microsoft also reported a 259 million dollar
3315920	3322960	decline in gaming revenue um with a decreased demand for xbox content and hardware um and
3324240	3332480	but offset by growth in terms of game pass they are pushing more and more into subscriptions to
3332560	3341440	supplement revenue and they're they're doing all right with that but they are they're still
3341440	3347200	hurting everyone's taken the hit so we'll see how it goes but i mean it makes sense because
3347200	3355760	when everyone was at home with nothing to do you know what else was there to do but but play video
3355760	3361040	games or do things online animal crossing and jackbox were carrying the industry for a few
3361040	3368960	months that's for sure pretty much you know any type of you know co-op gaming it was a way for
3368960	3377440	people to to stay together you know to be to be with other people without you know having to
3377440	3382400	leave the safety of your home for sure um interesting perspective from quest buster in
3382400	3387200	chat who says ironically ea's fiscal report beat expectations and did exceptionally well thanks
3387200	3392000	to games like fifa and f1 and didn't choice those like activision and declineville i think
3392000	3397760	there's probably a lot about what we're seeing now i mean you know certainly the physical elements
3397760	3402400	the superconductor shortages right like how many times have we pointed out you still can't walk
3402400	3406720	into target and pick up a ps5 off the shelf they are getting easier to get but they're still not
3406720	3411840	easy to get there's a difference between those two things they're not easy to get um so and that's
3411840	3415200	because they can't make enough of them to really meet the demand because of the the semiconductor
3415200	3420800	shortages and all that um i also think like right now you know because and again in there we have
3420800	3426320	the there's less triple a games from from sony i think specifically called that out and i think
3426320	3432480	that's a direct result of the slowing down of the workers the industry being able to work since
3433040	3437760	2020 and all those shutdowns you know i think companies are getting more and more used to
3437760	3442080	remote working or if they just haven't brought people back in person at this point or whatever
3442080	3448960	they're doing but i just think that this this hump that we're seeing was two years coming like
3448960	3453680	you know everything that shut down in 2020 and slowed everything down you know the games they
3453680	3457040	would have been working on in 2020 would have been games that would have been coming out around now
3457600	3466480	so it's just i i'm not surprised um with that uh and in nintendo's case is well i'm also thinking
3466480	3474240	in terms of manufacturing from china to um oh sure well with china and taiwan especially with the
3474880	3481440	military overtures china has been making toward taiwan we're also going to be looking at that
3481440	3486880	affecting affecting a certain uh amount of the manufacturing business oh yeah it's going to be
3486880	3491200	another holiday season where you can't go into target and get a ps5 it's going to be another
3491200	3496320	holiday season like that well and also though um just to add a little bit about the inflation
3496320	3507040	as i saw senate pass the inflation act um i i actually just saw that um uh for uh and also
3507040	3515840	the uh the health care and climate bill but the big one is the inflation yeah so we may start to
3515840	3520800	see things get a little bit better as inflation gets taken care of because it is pretty like i
3520800	3530960	said 40 year high yeah you know hopefully we'll uh we'll see um possibly even alternatives in
3530960	3539600	manufacturing being done due to requests for uh cleaner renewable resources so um recent parts
3539600	3549760	like uh a couple of tech companies out there have a like a a zero uh climate impact goal like for
3549760	3557520	the next i think it's like 15 years microsoft's one of them yeah yeah um and i think that um well
3557520	3566480	and and apple is definitely one um but i think that the video game industry needs to also be
3566480	3571360	taking that same approach with it to recycle as many materials as they have and even maybe start
3571360	3577920	putting manufacturing in house um that would certainly take care of some of it another element
3577920	3581520	of that article because this is a big thing in the industry right now you know especially with
3581520	3584800	the washington post commenting on it you know there's a lot of eyes you know watching what's
3584800	3588480	going on in gaming and then i know loki has another story that kind of touches on yet another
3588480	3592880	element of that uh get a little deeper dive on that but i want to bring up the nintendo part of
3592880	3596560	that and the whole you know that they're not selling as many switches as they used to i sort
3596560	3604960	of feel like maybe maybe i'm wrong maybe i'm silly but i i feel like nintendo's like sold switches to
3604960	3609360	everyone that's going to buy one at this point i mean yes there's always going to be new people
3609360	3614000	there's going to be you know people that age up and they want to get them and kids so i i get that
3614000	3619760	there's never like a stop to demand for the switch but i guess what it is is that i think many people
3619760	3626880	expected we'd have a switch pro or a new switch or a switch upgrade you fill in the blank here
3626880	3633040	you all know what i'm talking about something over the base model that came out what six years
3633040	3638320	ago at this point where how old is the switch six point six years five years i've lost count
3638320	3644160	but it's in tech in technology terms when we're sitting you know when when video games is
3644160	3649920	neighboring or heck is actually integrated with an industry that puts out new phones every single
3649920	3655600	year and new tablets every single year when the nintendo switch is sitting adjacent to that
3655600	3660320	it's a little weird that it's been five years without a major upgrade and i see pod culture
3660320	3666000	and chat of course pointing out the switch oled was kind of an upgrade but yeah and yes i'll
3666000	3671680	concede that point but it was i i don't it was the display it's a nicer display i don't think you
3671680	3677280	swayed a lot of existing owners to get a new switch of course there's always going to be a
3677280	3682480	few there's just you know nintendo nintendo or bust people that are going to get every product yes
3683120	3689520	but i i don't think it was enough clearly and the numbers reflect that to really try to you know uh
3689520	3694800	damn it or you know make an impact on these numbers so i'm curious okay when pod culture
3694800	3701840	points out i sold mine and upgraded well you know what that ends up being an even because nintendo
3701840	3706960	can count the upgrade that they sold you they can't count the one that you sold because that's
3706960	3712560	on the second-hand market nintendo doesn't get anything from that so it evens out in that case
3713520	3720400	but i think you all know that um wonder though if nintendo has any sort of recycling program
3720400	3725760	though for um i mean it would it would make sense that companies could probably
3726720	3732560	um set up like some sort of you know sellback system kind of like what they do with phones
3733520	3738240	where you could sell back your system to the manufacturer for credit on whatever the new one
3738240	3745600	is they take the parts to recycle so actually i refurbished i thought something like this sounded
3745600	3751440	familiar so i did a little google fu and nintendo does have on their official website a support
3751440	3755600	article about uh video game products have significant nostalgic value and are still fun
3755600	3760080	to play and own even decades after their first purchase unlike other electronics like cell phones
3760080	3764320	video game systems are usually kept resold or handed down to family and friends as such we see
3764320	3769200	very limited demand to dispose of video game products but then they say how do we minimize
3769200	3773840	the waste disposal video game products we offer a free and convenient take-back program for consumers
3773840	3778160	and businesses that would like nintendo to recycle their products for them the take-back program uses
3778160	3782480	a network of thousands of ups locations across the country to ship the products at no cost to
3782480	3787440	consumers we will even recycle a competitor's home console for consumers who have purchased
3787440	3792000	a nintendo system oh that's kind of interesting so and then they they go on and on with the details
3792000	3797200	i will i will get into the weeds so much so yes they have something set up but i never knew about
3797200	3802160	it until tonight and i bet many of our listeners didn't because i i guess they make a fair point
3802160	3806960	most consoles get handed down or preserved it's not like phones or pc parts or something like that
3807520	3814080	yeah see that less and less though with newer consoles as more of their game content becomes
3814080	3820400	you know cloud-based and we're gonna start seeing things break down with no way of fixing them
3820400	3827760	the backups are going to go you know lithium batteries are going to go you know a consumed
3827760	3835440	lithium ion battery can if it if it's constructed safely expand break the housing of you know its
3835440	3839280	container we've seen that with phones from multiple companies and different computers
3840080	3846800	it is not a dangerous thing it's a safety thing if it's like not popped if it's just expanded
3846800	3856160	that's what it's supposed to do um but um again we're probably going to start seeing more ways
3856160	3862080	that they're not going to be as salvageable and reusable like our older systems did that were all
3862080	3868800	cartridge based or media based of some kind you do make an interesting point because you know i
3868800	3874800	think about like microsoft's ecosystem and the fact that an xbox series x plays literally
3874800	3880800	everything from the xbox one and it plays most if not all mo no not all because there's still some
3880800	3886880	like ddr games and stuff but most of the xbox 360 library and some of the og xbox library so my
3886880	3894640	point is if you have an xbox series x there is no reason to own an xbox one unless like kids bedroom
3894640	3900480	secondary device etc etc i'm sure you all have your own reasons but in the long term you know
3900480	3905200	especially if microsoft stays with that strategy where they're they are upgrading their consoles
3905200	3909840	then they still kind of play everything in the past nintendo's argument about needing the old
3909840	3915760	stuff is a little bit changed so it's just interesting that's a very interesting sort of
3916720	3922880	perspective is that you know the newer consoles may not be as desirable to hold on to as the old
3922880	3929920	ones anyway um loki there was there was an element there too uh dark soccer kind of touched on it i
3929920	3935920	wanted to let you go a little deeper in this next story yeah so uh she talked a little bit about
3935920	3946720	how activisions making a lot of their money from mobile and pc so um well actually i should say
3946800	3955760	mobile versus pc and console so they actually made 51 of their total earnings for q2 from mobile uh
3955760	3964480	that adds up to about 830 million in mobile and of course console games are earning you know 376
3964480	3972800	million and pc 332 million i'm surprised to see pc so high um and then apparently 105 million from
3972800	3981680	event in esports also surprised to see how high that is um what's not helping though is that call
3981680	3991120	of duty at least the most um recent iteration of that is not doing well it's um actually losing
3991120	3999760	millions of players um just i guess not interested in vanguard which i yeah vanguard i don't think
3999760	4007840	was received as well and of course you know you have the persistent online uh stuff that they have
4007840	4014720	warzone it's kind of getting old so i think folks are kind of waiting for modern warfare 2 to
4014720	4022640	hopefully get that boost out of it um part of that as well um may remember that you know microsoft is
4022640	4029840	in talks to buy activision and they're still waiting for that to go through and of course
4029840	4040080	um sony has weighed in on that as well um there is apparently a uh kind of a back and forth going
4040080	4048560	here sony basically making the argument that the call of duty franchise is basically a system seller
4048560	4055040	that wherever it goes you know folks are going to buy the system specifically for call of duty
4055600	4062960	and ironically enough because you know microsoft has to counter that basically saying that you know
4062960	4072560	the um call of duty isn't necessarily a system seller it's um you know not really an essential
4072560	4080000	game i i think they're arguing that it's lost you know some of its draw now but of course sony
4080000	4085520	wants to make the argument that's essential so that this purchase doesn't go through but
4086400	4092160	i feel i still think it's going to go through i kind of think ultimately it goes through as well
4092160	4098720	um and um yeah i it's it's interesting how well the mobile's doing but i think it's also kind of
4098720	4102480	like you pointed out it's it's seriously a reflection on how poor some of the console and
4102480	4106640	pc development have been like you know call of duty sucks right now like you know and i don't
4106640	4112160	even really play that yeah but it's not a good place right now i think the modern call of duty
4112160	4117440	games are always going to be more popular than say the world war ii stuff world war ii has been done
4117440	4126000	to death and you're going back to vanguard i think folks are just kind of like yeah really
4126960	4132240	yeah so when modern warfare 2 is coming out now with all that stuff i think people a lot more
4132240	4138880	excited about that um maybe even less about the future tech stuff but i would say you know modern
4138880	4145680	seems to be the trend in a lot of views you don't have a lot of these big world war ii games it's
4145680	4152160	just kind of it seems to be the modern game i think even battlefield that um the modern
4152160	4157920	battlefield games do better than say battlefield 1 or something like that so and and it also
4157920	4162960	doesn't help that you know blizzard which is you know drives huge pc sales for them usually and
4162960	4169360	console 2 um hasn't really had anything that's really gone wow within the past year except or
4169360	4174880	maybe it is blizzard that's helping with that because of the mobile if i'm able to finish my
4174880	4181840	sentence except the diablo immortal of course is uh making you know quite a bit of money despite
4182080	4188960	the protests of people that say that the system is you know but you know their warcraft 3 remaster
4188960	4196400	not very well received diablo 2 remaster a pretty you know a decent reception but i'm not sure that
4196400	4201440	translated into sales at the end of the day i think you know is more of a there was a target
4201440	4205280	audience for that and i'm not sure it really transferred but you know there still hasn't
4205280	4209920	been that overwatch too there will be soon you know that's only a few weeks out at this point
4209920	4214960	so it'll be interesting to see the impact that has um and you know diablo 4 early next year
4214960	4219360	you know it looks like so it would be interesting to have those blizzard releases again there's
4219360	4223280	another wow expansion at some point too even though wow isn't the hitter it used to be
4223280	4228720	but um you know all of those will certainly pick up the pc console end of things but yeah it's just
4230080	4236320	it's just interesting that uh yeah and i i would assume that this report it's probably
4236320	4240640	diablo immortal might still be too soon to be totally reflected in this so it might still be
4240640	4247520	talking about mobile without uh that but i don't know you know again the first month was pretty
4247520	4254400	huge i think so all right uh well let's let's move on to a video game series that has no problem
4254400	4260000	making money still uh lots and lots of people you know sign right up for the latest releases in this
4260000	4264960	series and of course i am talking about the pokemans let's talk a little bit about pokemon
4264960	4270320	and the pokemon presents recap uh from what happened this last week so they actually did
4270320	4275680	a little pokemon uh presents which uh ended up being more than just scarlet and violet there
4275680	4280560	were some other announcements as well uh they mentioned that the world championships will be
4280560	4286960	in august in uh just a couple weeks really in london uh and they're gonna have um uh pokemon go
4286960	4292720	pokemon unite uh speaking of which pokemon go they're doing their uh pokemon go fest i think
4292720	4297920	was japan was this weekend and then they're going to do a finale event on august 27th and they
4297920	4302240	recently added daily adventure incense into the game which actually i i think that's one of the
4302240	4306880	better features they put in the game in a long time so i i can't really hate on that uh pokemon
4306880	4312800	unite is celebrating its first anniversary boy time flies uh they are currently going through
4312800	4320800	the pika party event so all pokemon are dressed as pikachu raid bosses pikachu players pikachu
4320800	4327360	they're all all the pikachus um which you know is a reminder there are over 800 pokemon are we
4327360	4331760	up to 900 now i think it might be 900 pokemon especially if you count you know galarian forms
4331760	4342320	and the like and yet we are still talking about pikachu um pokemon masters ex is getting into
4342320	4347680	its third anniversary uh there's a new content update called the trainer lodge that's coming
4347680	4354800	in august uh pokemon cafe uh is getting a remix entry uh so latias and latios are coming to
4354800	4359680	pokemon cafe which i thought was a terrible game uh but then we had a new trailer for something
4359680	4365680	that looks exciting pokemon scarlet and violet and we got to see the new legendaries uh that they
4365680	4370560	they fly they sail they drive like a motorcycle which is pretty cool uh we also got to see some
4370560	4378400	of the new pokemon like a um a new whooper form that is uh i think uh is it ground poison type
4378400	4382080	or something like that but it's you know a new typing he drank a lot of coffee yeah he drank a
4382080	4386880	lot of coffee some people are saying he's literally poop um but you know whooper is
4386880	4392080	pretty cute so it's it's uh hard to hate on that um so yeah we got you know we know there's going
4392080	4397760	to be some regional forms uh that will be unique as well also unique to scarlet and violet we found
4397760	4401840	out what's coming in place of dynamaxing and you know they always do something to like
4402400	4407680	maximize pokemon in every game there's something uh so in this one we're going to be getting
4408400	4415280	terrestilizing it's it's crystallizing literally the pokemon are crystallized after a long night of
4415280	4423680	hooking the trade uh stabbed stabbed whatever that that kennedy davenport um um monologue is
4423680	4430640	you know and then i had crystallized anyway that's uh what i uh couldn't stop thinking about when i
4430640	4436240	saw those but it did look cute i like the crystal looking pokemon uh fifth dream and chat points out
4436240	4441840	the leaks were true so for those that were putting their stock in the pokemon leaks looks like they
4441840	4448160	called it so gem crystal pokemon are going to be the new thing is i mean how is that just not
4448160	4453760	a different way of maxing pokemon like i feel like it's been maxing pokemon has been the thing
4453760	4457520	for several generations now but it's just a different a slightly different way to max them
4459760	4467520	either it's mega evolutions or it's gigantic or it's crystallizing it's kind of all the same
4467520	4470800	gimmick to me at the end of the day it's just them trying to rebalance everything
4470800	4476480	so all right but uh all that aside i'm hecka looking forward to scarlet and violet i'm really
4476480	4480480	excited to pick it up i feel like all the gays are getting violet because of the professor in
4480480	4485600	that game so i'm probably i'm gonna probably be a hipster and get scarlet um because i like i
4485600	4490080	like prehistoric lady too uh and dinosaurs are cool so i have no problem with the prehistoric
4490080	4494960	stuff uh so i'll probably pick up scarlet so i can be the popular one that everyone wants to
4494960	4501360	trade with that's my thinking process right now anyway so but i do love tron daddy professor i do
4501360	4505200	it's hard to resist all right uh moving on dark soccer
4508800	4509920	you have a mute on discord
4514400	4519360	all right there is the most adorable game in existence out there called stray
4519360	4526000	where you play as a stray kitty cat um going through some adventures
4526960	4536800	and the game has actually led uh to helping real cats so um a lot of uh different players online
4536800	4543200	have been playing uh stray like on twitch or wherever to raise money for animal shelters
4543200	4551600	and you know cat related charities and so uh uh annapurna um interactive the publisher
4552080	4556800	also decided to promote the game by offering two-carat rescue and adoption
4556800	4565360	agencies copies of the game to raffle off and they rented out a new york cat cafe um so uh
4567360	4577520	basically one of uh the the places was the nebraska humane society and uh they offered
4577520	4583600	up you know five dollar raffle tickets for the copy of the game and in one week they raised seven
4583600	4593600	thousand dollars and some of the uh donors were from germany and malta and and then annapurna also
4593600	4603040	uh offered uh one thousand thirty five dollars to the shelter um to help out with the kitties and um
4603760	4609200	also they you know like i said they bought the uh bought out meow parlor which is a new york cat
4609200	4615200	cafe and adoption agency for the weekend and they donated a thousand dollars and visitors who made
4615200	4620560	reservations could buy stray themed merchandise and play the game for 20 minutes while surrounded
4620560	4630480	by cats um apparently the cats were also super into the game um and uh they uh according to uh
4631440	4638400	jeff legaspi who is their marketing director i said it really made sense for them to to use
4638400	4643040	the game's launch to do something and i quote positively impactful and hopefully bring more
4643040	4652320	awareness to adopting and not shopping for a new pet um and stray was actually uh the number one
4652320	4664160	purchased game uh according to uh steam db uh for the past two weeks um but uh thanks to
4664960	4672240	you know the the the game being out they've raised a lot of money for different shelters
4672240	4679360	in the name of playing the game um a lot of players are twitch streamers are using uh
4679360	4686240	tiltify it's a little lot of people do their donation services through um but they're also
4686240	4691680	saying uh from the north shore animal league america they're another rescue that rescues
4691680	4699120	tens of thousands of animals every year um they had a major increase and they're seeing
4699120	4705760	that tiltify and live streaming is a new way to engage with uh with potential donors
4706400	4713200	um and just to keep people you know to spread information um there's also uh
4714160	4720800	uh one called just giving uh that does charity live streams said they had two campaigns already
4720800	4731440	just for stray and um several other players are just really going for it um and then there's this
4731440	4743600	one uh uh uh resident in omaha who goes by tray day 1014 did a charity live stream um his name is
4743600	4751040	tray he just said that doesn't want his last name to be used um but uh he said if i found out my cat
4751040	4758560	was outside doing this i'd be upset talking about the feats that the cats have to do and and then he
4758560	4764160	said that is a poor baby with the cat jumping down to different services i just thought that
4764160	4772480	was funny um but yeah there are there's just a lot more opportunities now to to help cats um
4773600	4780560	and i would even encourage people if you've got the resources to see if your community has a
4780800	4789600	uh a trapper uh neuter release tnr service and see if you can be a part of that um i'll go ahead
4789600	4793520	and use this moment to mention it what they in fact they do this with the disneyland cats
4794960	4801600	where um a cat a feral cat is safer in its own community than trying to be socialized it just
4801600	4810240	causes a lot more stress for the cat um and so what you do is you trap the local cats um if you
4810320	4814880	find kittens that can be socialized and then you want to foster and have them taken care of but
4815600	4823440	for uh you know for adult cats that are uh that can't be uh socialized you you take them usually
4823440	4830000	like humane society or other places around will have uh like some sort of uh free spay neuter
4830720	4836000	thing that that you can do to get the cats fixed and then they knock one of the ears they cut the
4836000	4841840	tip off and release the cat back into their community where they can no longer produce
4841840	4848320	you know progeny um and then that's one less breeding cat out in the community um
4849520	4857680	of course you know it's really good to i think it's like on average you can have between
4857680	4863600	three to six kittens a litter on average and think about the multiplication right there if
4863600	4872960	everyone did their part and at least donated to a local tnr um organization or you know shelters
4872960	4880560	or fostering or decided to do fostering themselves then we could really make a difference in keeping
4880560	4886800	the the population down we would have fewer cats out there with diseases um
4887200	4892960	out there you know affecting you know local wildlife populations uh
4894640	4899600	and and dying honestly being out there dying we would be able to make a big difference um
4899600	4908640	that's why i'm completely against breeding animals um especially since breeding certain
4908640	4914720	well you you can see it in mr swoosh he was clearly a bred cat but um when you breed cats
4914720	4918080	when you breed cats for certain traits like that they start to develop
4918080	4925200	uh more genetic deformities and have more health uh concerns than you know a rescue would
4925920	4932960	rescues are hardy more robust typically but um but again um to go back to the point
4933680	4941200	uh the game has really i think brought a lot of awareness not just financial you know assistance
4941200	4949200	to a lot of these companies but has opened discussion for how to take care of stray animals
4949200	4956880	how to help uh feeling communities and i think it's a really good thing so and if you if anybody
4956880	4969360	wants more information on uh tnr um or any any other resources like that um i i have some
4969360	4974720	resources also a really good one on youtube is flatbushcats they're a new york rescue
4975600	4981920	um and uh the kitten lady who's uh out of san diego and she does a lot of neonatal rescue
4982960	4988160	um in our chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network um bobby blackwolf catching the name of the
4988160	4992320	one in the article there um i think north shore is the one that does the kitten bowl during the big
4992320	4997520	football game it's run by howard stern's wife i didn't know that yeah so interesting yeah that's
4997520	5003360	a really that's a really good one and and also i mean i love that we're legally now able to have
5003360	5007440	cat cafes around i know i can't wait for the one here to open up i've always wanted to go to one
5007440	5016400	so yeah i think that that like the cat cafe is bunny cafes because i mean uh i think that marissa
5016400	5024080	got snoopy from a rescue my sister loves bunnies more than cats i love snoopy snoopy is such a
5024080	5029280	smart bunny and i'm not allergic to him for some reason my sister has a cat named mr bunny truth
5030400	5033040	so one of my friends in high school had a cat named bitch
5035440	5041360	um but anyway well and dan's uh grandfather had barn cats named uh hiss and spit
5043040	5050400	how fun but anyway back to back to this though um i would encourage people that when you are looking
5050400	5057600	for a pet again don't go to a breeder you do not know unless you've got like full lists of
5057600	5063600	pedigrees and everything for these animals you really don't know if they came from a puppy mill
5063600	5070480	or or you know some sort of massive breeding program you don't know about uh
5071920	5077440	what their genetic history is like and especially for for breeding and puppy mills they basically
5077440	5084480	keep these animals locked in small crates where they have no access to the outside and just breed
5084480	5093520	them over and over and over and they die like this and so please don't support that industry
5093520	5104000	um you know go adopt donate to your local uh no kill shelters fostering programs you know
5104000	5111840	and also i mean we now i mean we have all these resources you know if you want to do it through a
5111840	5117440	twitch stream look for a twitch streamer who's doing a charity or charity run then you can watch
5117440	5125040	them play fun games and support their channel as well as supporting a good cause all right well
5125040	5130320	we're going to get to our classic game in just a moment but first we have more news about a classic
5130720	5137040	that's true so we have an announcement of a new uh arcade one up cabinet one i think a lot of
5137040	5143440	people have been waiting for and that's for marvel vs capcom 2 so they announced that i think during
5143440	5150640	evo uh is when that announcement came out and um the cabinet not only will have marvel vs capcom 2
5150640	5156560	but the original marvel vs capcom uh marvel superheroes vs street fighter x-men vs street
5157120	5162880	marvel superheroes vs street fighter x-men vs street fighter marvel superheroes x-men children
5162880	5168160	of the atom x-men mutant apocalypse and marvel superheroes in the war of the gems
5168800	5174000	uh pre-orders are going to be starting september 8th and then they say they will be shipping a few
5174000	5180160	weeks after that i may or may not have told dan about this yeah no word on the price yet but
5180160	5185840	that's a pretty awesome collection and honestly plan on like six hundred dollars for a machine
5185840	5190400	like this with that type of brand at least there's seven games in it not just one so i think it's
5190400	5197680	eight yeah yeah oh sorry but whatever how honest i have most of these on saturn which is almost
5197680	5206160	arcade perfect but it's a really good collection for the versus games for the the you know the
5206160	5216400	marvel tie-in titles as well um i i remember being absolutely amazed uh when my friend uh
5217440	5227760	this is before uh i moved out here had uh uh words uh x-men on saturn just the x-men the first
5227760	5232880	x-men fighting game on saturn and i was like oh my god it's the arcade version you know and then
5232880	5240800	i moved out here and dan had a bunch of them and absolutely great all right well um let's talk
5240800	5247440	about a game that's probably inspired by classics and that is the announcement of a new game called
5247440	5253840	grim guardians demons purge and this is coming to us from inti creates is actually um putting
5253840	5258720	this game out and inti creates they've done um some pretty cool like retro inspired things
5258720	5264240	for example uh bloodstained ritual of the night mighty number nine so you know they have some
5264240	5270720	practice uh doing retro games uh or i should say like retro inspired type of stuff and um
5271680	5279760	this game looks like it is very much inspired by castlevania uh it's um not so it's it's interesting
5279760	5284320	this is coming from the same company who worked with um you know um bloodstained ritual of the
5284320	5288720	night but uh this is not a game from like igarashi and this is a little more like 2d
5289280	5294960	sprite based you know it obviously looks very similar to uh you know basically symphony of
5294960	5300800	the night and you know that whole era of games the the several uh ds and advanced titles that
5300800	5306560	were inspired by that as well this definitely looks very along those same lines um so we don't
5306560	5312240	know when it's coming out yet we just know tbd um but we know it's going to come out basically on
5312240	5318000	all the expected uh platforms but what was the name of the game again that is called grim
5318000	5322960	guardians demon purge i might have ordered a game very similar to this
5325040	5330640	well they just announced this one this weekend so it's a japanese game i ordered it from play
5330640	5337360	asia but it looks very similar to this yeah well castlevania games are hot we all love them all
5337360	5341520	all right well speaking of classics let's get to our next segment
5352560	5358080	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull
5358080	5362960	out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week
5363280	5369440	but once a month dark soccer gets into a classic electronic handheld so what do we have this month
5369440	5377440	dark soccer we have fire away by tandy and we also know what tandy is responsible for
5377440	5386560	radio shack um an incredible universe yeah right and you know the various ti calculators
5387440	5394320	uh sorry that's texas instruments my bad anyway um so fire away was a handheld a series of handheld
5394320	5402160	electronic games by tandy um starting in the 1980s there were six different products in the line
5402160	5409600	uh all were licensed by tandy rather than being original tandy games and they were all based on
5409600	5417680	space invaders so fire away um the first one was released in 1981 uh licensed from a japanese
5417680	5424640	company gakken who uh sold the game under the name invader it was also licensed to computer games
5424640	5431520	limited as galaxy invader and by vanity fair as electron blaster um anyway the games are all the
5431520	5437520	same he had a little joystick that would move uh you know move the gun base left and right and then
5437520	5442160	a large red button that would be your your fire i had one of these actually i had the white one
5443120	5449520	actually the one that's in the video was the one i had um um but you would you know basically
5449520	5457600	shoot them like space invaders uh they used four uh double a batteries um and went and uh had
5457600	5467920	leds for the invaders and everything um the game was originally 39.95 in 1981 money um and
5467920	5474400	basically you know three hits on one base by the bombs would end the game and once you reached 199
5474400	5485280	points the game ended in victory um so the the gakken and cgl ones used the white housing and
5485280	5496480	that was the one that that i had access to so in 1982 they did a fire away as cosmic 1000 fire away
5497200	5507360	um and uh it uh it had a few extra you know bells and whistles it had an invader zone in the ufo
5507360	5515680	zone and you had to get 999 points and you had an infinite number of uh sorry you had a finite
5515680	5519920	number of missiles you had 250 missiles that you could use but you could earn more missiles as you
5519920	5529920	went along and it retailed for 59.95 and then in 93 there was cosmic 2000 fire away um and then
5529920	5534800	they licensed the game though from a different company called hanzala instead of the one from
5534800	5542560	gakken um and it was also licensed by actronics um and marketed under the name twin vader 3
5543200	5548080	um and they tried to make the game look a little bit more like an arcade machine but they had like
5548080	5555280	different uh convoys of of invaders like different waves kind of a galaxian style and the game used
5555280	5562880	4c batteries and could be played using an ac adapter and it retailed for 39.95 1994 there was
5562880	5572080	tandy cosmic 3000 fire away um and this one was licensed back from gakken used very similar
5572080	5581520	styling um gakken called it galaxy invader 2000 um there were six tiers and had a missile station
5581520	5586800	barrier for invader zones and then the point tiers changed depending on where you were
5586800	5593600	um the ufo was gone yeah they made like a lot of different changes to it um and it was a
5595200	5603280	a little bit more akin to how uh having the special invader going at the top of the screen
5603280	5609120	to attack kind of galaga style it required 4c batteries could also use an ac adapter and
5609120	5620560	retailed for 39.95 um they let the the uh um the franchise lay for a little bit and then in 1989
5621200	5628240	they introduced lcd fire away um which was basically turning out the led for an lcd
5628240	5635040	it was also smaller um uses very similar control layout as cosmic 2000 fire away did um
5635040	5641600	lower price point it retailed for 12.95 um had reduced power needs it was able to use watch
5641600	5649280	batteries rather than double a or c batteries and tandy slash radio shack repackaged uh the game as
5649280	5657200	invasion force and later on in 1990 as jet fighter lcd fire away would be the last of its line now
5657200	5665680	there were other tandy fire away games so in 1981 bandai marketed flight time um in france it was
5665680	5673040	called a pillow de chasse um and the game uh actually still had flight time on the name but it
5673040	5680240	uh but uh tandy licensed that as a fire away um but it used aircraft rather than alien alien
5680240	5686240	invader so it wasn't quite the same of the line and it was sold only in the uk um one of the 12
5686240	5694560	games for the tandy 12 computerized arcade system was called fire away um very interesting little
5694560	5701840	thing by the way uh it it was a weird just look up the tandy 12 sometime you'll see what i mean
5702400	5709760	and then tandy also licensed nelsonic's 1981 watch game space attacker under the name cosmic fire
5709760	5717920	away game watch it was sold for 29.95 and the game was sold uh by collins industrial as a star
5717920	5725120	trek to wrath of khan video game watch while majestron released it as cosmic wars and so
5725120	5731760	that's it fire away all right there it is sorry i just agree on that one sorry for the accidental
5731760	5737120	music bed for half a second there my my finger slipped and hit the bump bump button again while
5737120	5741680	i was trying to flip the video but um there you go yeah uh i got to see a different a couple
5741680	5746000	different models there the fire away which i must admit i'm not familiar with this at all this is
5746000	5750720	uh educational segment for me tonight this is i never saw one of these ever so this is pretty
5750720	5756320	cool so i didn't know there's so many different versions of it being little and playing one um
5757200	5765120	my i i actually it was my step grandmother-in-law had it for the kids and then i got to take it home
5765680	5773200	and played a played a crap ton of it well one of these days i'll have to find one at a garage sale
5773200	5779520	or something catch up on what i missed all right uh let's get into some other news that happened
5779520	5786960	this week uh but at a rapid pace rapid fire news we'll go to loki yes uh so uh koch media has
5787600	5796560	decided to change their name um so they're gonna rebrand to play on so now they're playing on
5796560	5802160	at least i know how to pronounce that one because uh are they coke koch koch i there's different
5802160	5810320	ways you can say that so uh but um at least play on is um pretty pretty clear and i it's it's
5810320	5814640	actually kind of a cute name so and as jason said in the intro it doesn't sound associated with
5814640	5822000	anyone else so um yep i think it's i think it's a i think it's a good good name so yep um so and
5822000	5829520	apparently uh this first season of multiverses has been delayed indefinitely um they're going to
5829520	5835280	continue with the open beta right now but the 1.0 launch and new content are coming out later
5835280	5840800	day obviously they must be working on issues that are they're finding during the betas so
5841760	5849040	um understandable i guess um bobby blackwolf in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network clarifying
5849040	5854800	koch rhymes with scotch i follow one of their pr reps on twitter so who who clearly has been
5854800	5866400	asked this question before so all right uh dark sakura sure um for those of us that are still
5866480	5873600	keeping up with the bimani uh side of things we are getting beatmania 2d x 30 resident and it
5873600	5882720	will come with a new toby fox song um it uh has uh the song is called summer blue it's available
5882720	5887200	on the location test version and will appear in the public arcade version after konami updates
5887200	5894800	the build to resident um it will upgrade the arcade games resolution to full hd 1080p
5896400	5900640	uh it will also have several quality of life improvements such as notes radar based
5900640	5905360	recommendation folder and a more detailed option to display fast and slow input markers
5906160	5917280	um and it again is the 30th iteration of beatmania 2dx um and uh the 20th anniversary of this series
5917280	5922240	was in 2019 though just to point that out it's not like an anniversary edition just like a
5922240	5930000	the 30th version um it's location test is at game silk hat kawasaki dice in kanagawa
5930960	5938880	until august 7th so uh today or maybe well it's already over then and then it will replace the
5938880	5946640	ongoing uh beatmania 2dx 29 cast hour with a new version uh some comments in chat dark tetsuya says
5946640	5950560	yeah the location test is over the weekend it does look pretty slick i can't believe they made it to
5950560	5957600	30 games i can and orange right says beatmania 2dx 30 resident evil people have already made
5957600	5965280	that joke it's old okay um so um i i feel like back in the day we were talking about like
5965280	5971680	third fourth and fifth style um so now here we are 30th style and i'm sorry i think fourth
5971680	5977280	style is the best it's i'm sorry it's it's gonna be uh it's always gonna be 30th style to me so uh
5978240	5986720	these subtitles be damned but uh i will point out the last home version we got was 2dx 16 princess
5986720	5992000	so we haven't had a home version and now i guess 15 games if you want to that come out
5992000	5998720	yeah i don't remember that version uh i had probably stopped oh i'm sorry empress not princess
5998720	6003360	see i can't even get the names names straight so thank you dark tetsuya it's empress not princess
6003440	6009840	but um that was the last one that was the playstation 2 um yeah and orange right points
6009840	6014320	out that 2dx infinitas which i know has been emailed to us before so that that's you know
6014320	6019040	their online service is kind of what they do instead now at this point which i they don't
6019040	6025360	want to make they don't want to make peripherals for the home anymore especially after generally
6025360	6029280	the video game population got burned out on guitar hero and rock band and all that stuff you know
6029280	6035360	music game plastic instruments kind of came and went uh and but did they really try though
6036160	6041520	like did they well yeah and i i yeah i would argue there's still an audience for it but the
6041520	6046720	audience just isn't big enough this is the sad part if we're gonna base all of our like well
6046720	6054480	they're just not interested in the genre anymore off rock revolution i mean come on uh dark to see
6054560	6061600	says yeah 2009 was the last official cs release was 2009 my god yeah because i remember it was
6061600	6066400	two discs because one was the like empress disc with all the new songs and they had like a
6066400	6076880	bet greatest hits or whatever so all right i think the last one i purchased was fuck uh
6076880	6084160	eighth style i think for me it was nine so yeah um i can't remember if i got 10 or not i don't
6084160	6088800	think i did i think it was just nine was where that kind of stopped so i do miss those games
6088800	6092400	though um and that's probably you know when i do get to visit this new round one that's probably
6092400	6096400	the game i'm going to play the most is the the 2dx just because you know i can play all the
6096400	6101920	old songs on it but i do i do force myself to explore some of the new stuff i just you never
6101920	6106480	have enough time on the song select screen to really see you know and then you also don't want
6106640	6110640	be sitting there all day listening to song previews so there is the sense of you know
6110640	6116400	pick it up anyway all right uh one other story and it's about teenage mutant ninja turtles the
6116400	6121760	cowabunga collection which of course is the much anticipated collection of classic classic ninja
6121760	6127360	turtles games including the various fighting games and uh konami has said that the teenage
6127360	6132960	mutant turtles tournament fighters release will have rollback code when you play online so it's
6133040	6138800	going to have something that some modern fighting games still don't have uh so uh don't know if the
6138800	6143520	genesis and the nes versions of the game will also get that rollback code but the arcade versions
6143520	6148560	sure will which i would imagine is going to be the preferred way to play but you know people have
6148560	6154880	their nostalgic memories and want to revisit on other uh platforms as well as a reminder this is
6154880	6162000	coming out pretty much on uh all the platforms that exist currently on august 30th so uh konami
6162000	6169280	put a little tweet about that out this week as well so pretty cool all right uh let's travel
6169280	6174080	around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out to a game store near you
6174080	6182080	we'll start in the us with loki uh we have oita beppu mystery guy the warped bamboo lantern on pc

6255040	6265040	of yomi on playstation 5 marvel's spider-man remastered on pc and super bullet break on pc
6265440	6271280	into the switch and playstation 4 that's it all right going over to japan this week um as far as
6271280	6276000	the nintendo switch is concerned it's pretty slow there's really no major releases on the switch
6276000	6280480	this week there are some third-party peripheral type things like if you need some new screen
6280480	6285280	protectors or there's this interesting little new dock coming out it's not an official nintendo
6285280	6290800	product but it's like a dock that your switch can lay on at an angle and you plug your land into the
6290800	6296560	dock as well so it's kind of just another way to uh you know um save some space and you know have
6296560	6301200	your system there so um that is something you can get but that's not really a game that's just a
6301200	6309440	peripheral uh but if we go over to playstation yeah playstation 5 uh we have guilty gear strive
6309440	6313840	uh the starter edition that is out in a couple days in japan which is um usually games don't
6313840	6319280	release on monday but that's just you know what we got uh and that's really the only major release
6319280	6325200	we don't have another big release for a week so that's it slow week in japan dark sakura how
6325200	6332720	about europe uh just a few uh we have on the ninth two-point campus for the big three um on the 12th
6332720	6340800	we have among us for playstation xbox switch also on the 12th for switches oxide room 104
6340800	6348720	and for playstation fishing north atlantic that's it okay let's get a few more stories in and then
6348720	6355440	we'll get to tweets emails phone calls and you uh in your voices in our roundtable segment but first
6355440	6365040	loki um so there's a rumor that tencent's looking to purchase the majority stake in ubisoft so this
6365040	6371440	is coming from writers who is saying that multiple sources with direct knowledge in the matter is
6371440	6377760	saying that tencent is expressed desire to become the key stakeholder in ubisoft and they're even
6377840	6385760	willing to pay a premium of a hundred dollars per share which is more than double the cost of
6385760	6395520	the shares right now to make it happen so um there's also some of the um founders they're
6395520	6402960	saying they've been looking to purchase the company outright um interesting though if that happens
6403680	6409200	of course you know they own uh they have you know stakes in activision supercell epic games
6409200	6416240	remedy riot games platinum games bohemian interactive dot not uh klee and inflexion
6416240	6421600	and funcom yeah they own a lot they they do and this is interesting because it's one of
6421600	6426320	those things where i'm like tencent has their fingers in too many pies in the gaming industry
6426320	6430240	you know and i think we know they're they're they're around like literally everywhere and
6430240	6434560	it's you know so when you hear this story at first you're kind of like do they really need
6434560	6442800	to do this but of course it's ubisoft and just last week we were talking about how
6442800	6447600	eve's gilmont needs to go but he's probably not going to go anywhere anytime soon because his
6447600	6453120	family has the you know majority stakeholder in this whole thing and so it is an interesting kind
6453120	6461520	of which one's worse i don't know make them go i don't think they would care yeah so i yeah if
6461520	6468800	tencent comes in um would it really change anything i'm not sure but uh it might lead to
6468800	6473520	that change and that would be more exciting uh zen monkey 11 in chat says ubisoft sucks now so
6473520	6477440	let them have it that's kind of like that's basically what it is is it's kind of like
6478240	6483120	is it is it really going to be any worse it's in it's pretty bad it's in a pretty bad shape
6483120	6486560	right now and i'm just talking i'm not just talking about the quality of the games or what
6486560	6490160	it is they're putting out i'm just talking about you know how it's run as a company you know and
6490160	6496640	again i'll defer to last week and yet another rant on east gabot and why openly questioning
6496640	6501920	why he's not held accountable as ceo and then the open answer of oh money and his you know
6501920	6508800	and his you know stock basically um quest buster in chat says there's also a story that square enix
6508800	6513440	is looking to sell stakes in their studios which some see as bazaars they're not exactly hurting
6513440	6518400	for cash right now especially after selling off a few of their western studios yeah it all comes
6518400	6523280	back to that rumor that like square enix just wants to be bought by sony they just want to be
6523280	6529440	bought by sony uh and that all these moves you've seen him make about like uh selling off you know i
6529440	6535360	the idos and you know everything they had over here and all that was part of that and just but
6535360	6543280	it but yeah square enix isn't hurting for cash but final fantasy 14 is really i don't want to
6543280	6547840	say it's carrying that company because that would be a little bit sensationalist but fantasy 14 is
6548560	6555920	buoying the numbers in the way a lot of companies don't have a game to do that it's a nice bolster
6555920	6562800	yes it's it's it's a nice classic classique to you know that that's a old standby that's gonna
6562800	6569920	keep things keep the lights on while these other things are going on so um but that won't last
6569920	6577040	forever just look at you know activisions world of warcraft for former position you know it's no
6577040	6583440	longer the you know most talked about mmo and one day fall of se 14 will no longer be the most
6583440	6589440	talked about mmo you know ebb and flow things change so um i just it's just weird to see a
6589440	6595680	company like square enix just making these weird business decisions to just get bought
6596320	6601040	it's just are they really acting in the best interest of their stakeholders it's weird
6602560	6608560	it's like they're giving up what is logic i think we don't have any anymore all right well let's
6608560	6614800	move on uh let's let's move back to a time when things were uh there were a lot of business
6614800	6617600	decisions that probably still didn't make sense but we didn't have to read about them on the
6617600	6628080	internet with this game oh yeah sorry i looked at the thing and you talked and i went brain
6628720	6636800	so i thought it was loki's turn um neo geo pocket color games we love them
6636800	6643360	and uh rockman battle and fighters was a uh fighting game that came out of neo geo
6643360	6650000	pocket color only in japan 20 years ago it was a fun little game and now uh the game is available
6650000	6655680	on switch of course uh they of course have changed it from rockman to mega man because
6655680	6661600	you know america and it's 7.99 and it's part of the neo geo pocket color selection from smk
6661600	6666880	it is interesting to see how more and more of those games are coming out on the switch and
6666880	6673680	kind of getting a second life or really in the america as a first life so it's cute i'll check
6673680	6678560	it out because i never played this game so it's cute it's a fun little game um i'm trying to
6678560	6686080	remember who who's i had that played it but like you could play like the dragon as one of your
6686080	6693120	versus fights it was pretty cool oh that's cool all right uh loki uh one more story for us yeah
6693120	6702480	so there's a nintendo fan game that's being put together uh based off of uh super mario 64 called
6702480	6710720	another princess is in our castle it's a a first person horror game set in uh the super mario 64
6710880	6718320	peaches castle and you have to find different relics while avoiding a ghost princess
6719920	6726000	that looks kind of horrific and it's free to play on itch.io until you know the lawyers take
6726000	6731520	it down it's not actually a mod of the game though it does look like uh a mod but it's it's
6731520	6736400	just a game that's done that style yeah but even if they actually use mario in it they're all right
6736880	6742240	shut down yeah yeah yeah no i'm so i'm surprised it isn't already down it must be that the lawyers
6742240	6746720	aren't working on sunday but by golly first thing tomorrow morning that fax is going to come through
6748000	6752480	so i say that no one uses fax anymore that email it's going to come through so actually
6752960	6757600	and it's also it's just it's not even done yet it's just in development so it's like
6759920	6763040	well guess who just downloaded it great yeah i was to say grab it while you can
6763680	6768720	so guess who's just downloaded both versions of it it might be i i'd be curious about it
6768720	6773040	there's a lot of good a lot of great mods out there that nintendo ends up shutting down because
6773040	6778720	you know yeah their fans are very generous it's fun they have like people posting their youtube
6778720	6788880	videos for underneath the game and like just like the thumbnails are just so terrible sensationalist
6788880	6797120	thumbnails on youtube get out well i know what all right uh well all good things must come to
6797120	6803760	an end and the weu uh really seems to be uh looking at its end uh pretty soon uh because
6803760	6807600	we just heard now that they're going to be losing two more video services which i'm gonna be honest
6807600	6813440	i thought these things were already sunsetted on weu um but it's official uh youtube and crunchy
6813440	6819440	roll will no longer be supporting the weu as of later this year uh google's website mentions that
6819440	6825280	youtube will no longer be available in october um if you want to watch videos on the weu you can
6825280	6830880	keep doing it until then but then once youtube goes offline on the weu you will be advised you
6830880	6835040	should probably move over to the switch or you know one of the other hundreds of devices that
6835040	6840800	will run youtube uh crunchy roll kind of followed suit on august 29th you will no longer be able to
6840800	6846000	get crunchyroll on the e-shop and if you got it before that you still you can't access service
6846000	6851280	anymore but crunchyroll also has a switch app and i imagine if you log in with your credentials on
6851280	6855440	the switch or probably any platform you can still get access to you know whatever it is you are
6855440	6863840	watching on crunchyroll um so uh on the 3ds also this is uh a little more uh not for the us but
6863840	6870720	for japan nico nico uh for the 3ds will be going offline uh in april of 2023 so it's still a little
6870720	6875600	ways out uh but that will uh give you a chance to spend those premium tickets because they're going
6875600	6881280	to stop selling those on september 12th keep in mind march 2023 you can't get anything on the
6881280	6887040	weu or 3ds e-shops because all the content will no longer be purchasable and you cannot download
6887040	6892240	free content that would include these various video apps so the hand was kind of forced to
6892240	6897360	shutting these down anyway but i would also think with something like youtube like you know they're
6897360	6902080	gonna want to roll out new features and things like that and how long do they want to keep
6902080	6908320	supporting a weu app they don't so they don't i'm kind of surprised they still do to be quite that's
6908320	6912800	the most shocking thing in the story is that that wasn't already sunsetted but i don't think youtube
6912800	6918480	has made major major changes in several years so it probably still kind of runs off the same
6919040	6926880	you know uh code as before but all right uh zen monkey 11 and chat says i forgot my weu had
6926880	6932640	youtube i can't wait for them to fully abandon it so we get all the cool homebrew that is an
6932640	6938240	interesting silver lining once they just pull the plug on on the weu completely then that means no
6938240	6942960	more patches will be delivered either so homebrew is gonna rip that thing wide open that will be
6942960	6948240	interesting so yeah you can just play it on pc at this point i guess you can do all the homebrew
6948240	6954640	there if you want true true all right uh let's go to some further listener comments in our round
6954640	6960480	table where we will open it up if we want to get any calls on discord vog network.com that's vog
6960480	6966480	network.com slash discord if you head on over to the green room uh we will be pulling some callers
6966480	6973040	on air in a little bit uh in the meantime we can get to emails if there are any i don't know if i
6973040	6979920	saw it it was garbage yeah it was like spam which the spam is interesting so i'm not gonna i'm not
6979920	6984080	gonna acknowledge it or say what it is because i'm not giving him free publicity but i looked
6984080	6987920	into it because actually that first email they sent because that was a follow-up email that was
6987920	6991840	in there this week the first email they sent actually caught my attention because i was like
6991840	6995840	oh it's like a new platform oh this is they have some interesting names they have some heavy talent
6995840	7003440	on this okay what is this all about i look into it more it's a platform to sell nfts based on
7004080	7008800	i deleted the emails yeah i don't blame i don't blame you at all which which we should have
7008800	7012880	already been deleted the moment we found out that they were spam well they were forwarded to my
7012880	7017920	personal email as they usually are uh so that's where i saw them so um and you can log into the
7017920	7022960	email outside of sundays and do that as well you don't have to do it right now um but it is what
7022960	7031440	it is that's work so i'm being you know i'm being silly i know dr c in chat says i was going to say
7031440	7038320	of course that was the punchline absolutely absolutely i don't who's who thinks that people
7038320	7047440	want to buy nfts of old episodes of their stuff let's get to some tweets uh over at twitter.com
7047840	7054320	olr where you guys uh tweet us and there was actually a really funny slash cute tweet that
7054320	7061280	arrived today uh which showed at ikea this was something tweeted at us from uh dark tetsuya that
7061280	7068480	said um not sure if this is anything but a random daytona usa cab was spotted at an ikea thought you
7068480	7072560	would all appreciate it and there was an embedded quote tweet can someone explain to me why there's
7072560	7077200	a daytona machine at ikea and uh it was interesting though because there was a reply from richie
7077840	7081680	i don't know if they still listen to the show but hello if you're out there who says my bet
7081680	7090000	is storage purposes and i never thought of that of like an ikea being like a storage house but
7090000	7097040	those places are very big it's it's it's just interesting to to see that but there's photographic
7097040	7104240	evidence on the tweet it's just kind of funny daytona at an ikea who would have thought um so
7104240	7112560	that is that is the tweet of the week over at olr um let me see if we have any last minute stories
7112560	7122000	um loki no no uh let's see uh and in chat i think i see i see just i want to tip the hat over to
7122000	7127440	jim sally i see you there in chat hello it's great to see you here uh who asks any way to
7127440	7133040	chat besides discord i'm sorry we did have to sunset skype uh when we moved over to twitch
7133040	7137280	unfortunately the technical limitations of skype did not allow us to continue to take
7137280	7142800	calls on that platform uh i i and if i can just you know somebody accused me of throwing shade
7142800	7148160	earlier if i can go one step further in my shade throw and just say microsoft completely shit the
7148160	7155200	bed with skype uh in in the last couple years and they've gotten their ass handed to them uh by zoom
7155200	7160240	and other competing platforms and quite frankly microsoft deserved it uh and there's a lot that
7160240	7167120	microsoft has done right over the years uh love xbox and the direction that's gone game pass is a
7167120	7171920	fantastic deal in gaming love to see what they're doing with the cloud technology but as far as
7171920	7183680	skype goes boy you you you could have had it all but you let it go oh well uh vo by curtain chat
7183680	7189360	says well they leaned away from skype for consumer and leaned into teams for business
7189360	7196560	yeah and i i i know that well you know this is a little more like opinion so but most people i
7196560	7203440	know that are on teams at work don't care for it um but that's you know maybe that's by of course
7203440	7208000	there will be inevitably somebody in chat who pipes up and says i use it and i love it okay
7208000	7215680	great but i haven't seen it really like get through the way uh zoom has and god probably
7215680	7220160	even webex uh when we talk about the corporate world and that sort of stuff so
7221040	7228240	um vo by kurt says i will say that we use it regularly but we use zoom as well yeah i i have
7228240	7234640	heard of teams being like the chat and zoom being like the video chat and i think that's the way
7234640	7239920	some businesses are running too so just you know depends where you're at we use we use slack and
7239920	7246400	and uh uh webex you know i've never worked in a business that used slack i just it's which
7246960	7250720	i wish they would but they you know they don't for whatever reason so i've only ever used it
7250720	7255760	my personal life so like it's been pretty friendly yeah yeah i like there's a lot i like the
7255760	7261520	integrations people build some powerful stuff on slack um i use it for ingress that's how our team
7261520	7266640	keeps in touch we have a restricted ingress chat thing on slack so only the players that have met
7266640	7271280	each other we all know you know so when we do these super secret ops where we're making very
7271280	7276560	big triangles over all of norcal we're planning a lot of that in slack uh and uh it's you know
7276560	7280880	there's a lot of integrations that um help with that and directing people where to go and stuff
7280880	7288560	which is pretty cool so um so uh yeah and interesting pop culture says every place in the
7288560	7294880	past few years i've been used slack interesting i just you know perspective so all right well i
7294880	7299920	don't see any calls in the green room so i think we are about wrapped up it was you know even
7299920	7304880	though with evo this weekend actually one thing i'll call out with evo evo sorry i always want to
7304880	7310400	say evo but it's because because and it's because of 2dx my brain always goes back to that old song
7310400	7320160	and 2dx read e v o 66 i always think evo when i see that so evo was this weekend and my understanding
7320160	7325440	is they teased tekken 8 but they didn't say it was tekken 8 and it was literally like frames
7326160	7330800	that they were showing of like i think it was they showed like a classic tekken cut scene
7330800	7335840	and then it like morphed into what the character might look like now and everybody's screaming
7335840	7340880	tekken 8 but then that's that's that's really all was it was it was literally the the the
7341440	7346240	a breath of a tease so you gotta wonder if sony isn't planning an event in the coming months and
7346240	7350720	maybe they'll say more about tekken 8 then who knows uh dark to see it does mention about evo
7350720	7355040	though that there is a new garu mark of the wolves sequel coming yeah i did know that's pretty it
7355040	7359200	seems like a long time coming uh that that is finally happening so that's pretty cool i love
7359200	7365600	that all right well with that we will start to wrap up for the night and get get around to
7365600	7371360	everybody's final thoughts and night so uh before i get to that i'll just say thank you as always

7417360	7422080	said it might have been someone else but he's like you you all make that game sound so horrible for
7422080	7427760	how much you play it and i'm like the game that's horrible it's the people playing it you and you
7427760	7433600	know what you know what any sport people talk like if like if we were talking about baseball
7433600	7437760	we'd be talking about how some of the refs are completely horrible and make bad calls
7437760	7442080	and how some of the players are are trash or whatever it is you know that time
7442080	7447520	there's there's trash talk in every sport look at rupaul's drag race and twitter
7448480	7454320	and yes that's a sport for some people and there's you know people don't always represent that
7454320	7459760	community very well either so it's just it's one of those interesting things so anyway uh we'll

7523600	7526720	three and a half weeks really i'm going to be dragon con again it's just wild to think about
7526720	7532320	so but i'm really excited um and i know things like you know covid and monkey pox and all that
7532320	7536320	remain a concern although i did get my vaccine for one of them uh well actually both of them
7536320	7543280	um but you know um at some point you have to just assess the risks um and
7544240	7550080	that includes the risk to your mental health for continuing to sit out so um i'm looking forward
7550080	7555920	to going to dragon con and seeing my friends talking craft with digital media talking games
7555920	7562560	with the gaming track and talking maybe something new this year stay tuned um oh vo by kurtz says
