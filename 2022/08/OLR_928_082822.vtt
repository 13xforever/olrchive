00:00.000 --> 00:13.680
In the era of mass storage and everything, connectivity by default, gaming adapts to

00:13.680 --> 00:15.860
make continued use of it like everything else.

00:15.860 --> 00:19.620
Instead of getting an entire game upfront, published to physical media and then going

00:19.620 --> 00:23.780
unchanged, now more games can push a solid foundation and continue developing it as time

00:23.780 --> 00:24.780
goes on.

00:24.780 --> 00:27.940
Tonight, we discuss an OG of PC gaming that continues this trend.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.080
This is my leading commentary with no proper noun.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.020
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

00:33.020 --> 00:35.840
the game and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where

00:35.840 --> 00:37.380
every gamer has a voice.

00:37.380 --> 00:43.540
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:43.540 --> 00:45.660
where every gamer has a voice.

00:45.660 --> 00:52.780
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 928 of our

00:52.780 --> 00:57.840
show for tonight, August 28th of 2022.

00:57.840 --> 01:02.680
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me on this program, as they always do, say hello

01:02.680 --> 01:05.800
first and foremost to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.480
Hi, how are you doing?

01:10.480 --> 01:11.920
I'm feeling better.

01:11.920 --> 01:18.160
I went back to work, but I've had to leave early both days because my cough was kind

01:18.160 --> 01:22.960
of bad and my throat hurt, but I'm getting better, staying longer, working through it.

01:22.960 --> 01:23.960
There you go.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.400
Well, I'm glad you're improving, even if not maybe at 100% yet.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.960
I'm glad it's getting better.

01:27.960 --> 01:28.960
That's good.

01:28.960 --> 01:29.960
Yeah.

01:29.960 --> 01:34.360
And I've found some extra supplements that have been helping with the brain fog, so that's

01:34.360 --> 01:35.360
really good.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.360
Oh, that is good.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.360
So, okay.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.360
Yeah.

01:38.360 --> 01:41.800
I'll pass on more later, or if anyone wants to know.

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
Excellent.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.520
Let's also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.520
Hello.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.520
Hi, Loki.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.520
How are you?

01:47.520 --> 01:48.520
Okay.

01:48.520 --> 01:53.040
So, I have to ask of this game that's playing behind you tonight, because this is not a

01:53.040 --> 01:54.880
Mega Man game I recognize.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.280
And actually, quickly, let me, of course, say for those on the podcast feed, I'm talking

01:58.280 --> 02:03.440
about the video that we're seeing live at twitch.tv, because we do tape live every Sunday

02:03.440 --> 02:08.440
night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

02:08.440 --> 02:12.520
VOG Network, or VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:12.520 --> 02:16.440
And although it is Orange Lounge Radio and not Orange Lounge Video, once in a while,

02:16.440 --> 02:19.880
I can't help but notice some things on video that I have to call out.

02:19.880 --> 02:24.000
And one of these is this Mega Man game I don't recognize playing behind Loki tonight.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
What's going on here?

02:25.000 --> 02:32.360
So, this is a fan game, it's called Mega Man Ram, and it's by a guy called Jay Bit.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.360
Okay.

02:33.360 --> 02:39.840
Not to be confused with Mega Ran, the famous nerdy musician, rapper, individual, who I

02:39.840 --> 02:41.400
think was on the show once a long time ago.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.400
Like Nerdcore.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
Yeah, like Nerdcore.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
Yeah, I believe he was.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.400
I think he was.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.400
He was on the show a long time ago.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.400
A while ago, yeah.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.400
Yeah.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.400
So, well, I hope he's doing well.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.360
Shout out to Mega Ran, who I think, I think, I could be wrong, but like me, will be at

02:53.360 --> 02:55.600
Dragon Con this coming weekend.

02:55.600 --> 03:00.600
So, for those that I have met at Dragon Con who might be hearing this episode, and it's

03:00.600 --> 03:05.400
their first taste of OLR, hello and welcome, and hope you enjoy the show this week.

03:05.400 --> 03:11.320
Myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki, we all met playing a little video game called Dance Dance

03:11.320 --> 03:12.320
Revolution.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.300
Yes, that infamous music game.

03:14.300 --> 03:19.840
We met playing that game a long time ago, over 20 years ago, if you can believe it,

03:19.840 --> 03:21.940
at Roseville Golf Land, playing that game.

03:21.940 --> 03:25.220
And we thought, you know what, we love this so much, and we love getting together with

03:25.220 --> 03:28.340
our friends afterwards, and just sitting around talking about video games.

03:28.340 --> 03:31.220
We're going to start a show online where we talk about video games.

03:31.220 --> 03:35.600
And here we are, all these years later, and we invite all of you to sit at the table with

03:35.600 --> 03:40.960
us after gaming, after a long night of gaming every week, as we do here on Sunday night,

03:40.960 --> 03:43.620
and invite you all to participate along with the show.

03:43.620 --> 03:48.900
So there's our little reintroduction of the show, as we tend to do.

03:48.900 --> 03:55.220
Coming to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network, thank you, Sean322 donated

03:55.220 --> 03:57.660
some biddies because of the shout out to Mega Ran.

03:57.660 --> 04:01.140
Well, unfortunately, Mega Ran doesn't get any of that money, so make sure you stream

04:01.140 --> 04:06.060
the music, buy the album, make sure you support the talent that is Mega Ran.

04:06.060 --> 04:10.140
And Dark Tetsuya says, speaking about the game playing behind Loki tonight, it didn't

04:10.140 --> 04:14.700
look like Mega Man 9 or 10, so my first thought was some wild rom hack.

04:14.700 --> 04:19.140
You know, I always underestimate, I don't, but it's one of those out of sight, out of

04:19.140 --> 04:20.140
minds.

04:20.140 --> 04:23.460
I always underestimate what the homebrew community can do.

04:23.460 --> 04:28.340
Like, I don't, like the fact that a homebrew person made this doesn't surprise me at all,

04:28.340 --> 04:30.700
but I just like, you know, it's kind of one of those out of sight, out of mind things.

04:30.700 --> 04:31.700
You don't keep tabs on it.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.700
It's like, whoa, whoa, somebody made like a complete Mega Man game from scratch?

04:34.700 --> 04:35.820
Of course they did.

04:35.820 --> 04:36.820
Of course they did.

04:36.820 --> 04:38.380
It wasn't even a rom hack either.

04:38.380 --> 04:40.380
So yeah, it's pretty cool.

04:40.380 --> 04:47.620
So they made a Mega Man, they made a Mega Man PC game better than the Mega Man PC port.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.620
I think, which of which I think there were two.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.100
Did you, okay.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.740
Did you ever play the original Mega Man PC that was like CGA graphics?

04:54.740 --> 04:56.780
It was like three bosses.

04:56.780 --> 04:57.780
I did.

04:57.780 --> 04:58.780
I bought it at the store.

04:58.780 --> 05:01.980
I think I must have bought it at the store, but no, it was not good.

05:01.980 --> 05:04.340
It was like Volt Man was one of them.

05:04.340 --> 05:07.060
There was, but yeah, it's like a long lost Mega Man game.

05:07.060 --> 05:09.440
They had robot bosses that weren't in any of the other games.

05:09.440 --> 05:13.220
So yeah, I think there are some that they actually did bring out to other games later

05:13.220 --> 05:14.220
on.

05:14.220 --> 05:17.660
Um, and also those bosses were featured in the comics too.

05:17.660 --> 05:18.660
Yeah.

05:18.660 --> 05:21.700
I know I've been really brushing up on my Mega Man since, you know, doing the Minecraft

05:21.700 --> 05:23.700
stuff.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.700
What's up with this?

05:24.700 --> 05:25.700
You going on Mega Man Jeopardy?

05:25.700 --> 05:30.060
Like what's, what's no, I'm, I've been in the Wiki a lot, a lot, a lot.

05:30.060 --> 05:35.820
So like, you know, there's a lot of that stuff that I run into, but yeah, so there's, um,

05:35.820 --> 05:39.820
yeah, there's some of the bosses that were in the PC one that actually ended up making

05:39.820 --> 05:43.420
it to like the Archie comics or whatever, uh, which was pretty cool.

05:43.420 --> 05:48.300
Um, and I think there was one guy though that was part of three that ended up getting remade

05:48.300 --> 05:52.900
for another game later on, um, or in try and chat says those two dos games actually have

05:52.900 --> 05:54.220
a pretty interesting history.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.220
Yeah.

05:55.220 --> 05:58.100
So you're not the only one that's spent many a night on Wikipedia or whatever, reading

05:58.100 --> 06:01.580
about dos based Mega Man games that most people forgot about.

06:01.580 --> 06:03.060
So love it.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.060
All right.

06:04.100 --> 06:08.060
Well, we didn't forget about, uh, lots of big announcements going on this week because

06:08.060 --> 06:13.540
of Gamescom, which, um, did happen this week, uh, which is newsworthy in itself because

06:13.540 --> 06:18.820
you know, E3, which is like the big thing that happens in the US every year hasn't really

06:18.820 --> 06:24.900
happened for a little bit since COVID, um, came so, but Gamescom out in Germany and Europe,

06:24.900 --> 06:29.500
it did happen this week and they did the, uh, what they split it up into like a business,

06:29.500 --> 06:33.180
um, and, um, uh, public event, right?

06:33.220 --> 06:36.020
They do like two days of business, three days public, something like that.

06:36.020 --> 06:41.500
So they do like a combined thing and, uh, it all kicked off this week with some announcements

06:41.500 --> 06:48.580
and the, I guess, should we call it much anticipated Jeff Keighley world premiere fest rollout

06:48.580 --> 06:51.620
of Gamescom opening night world premiere.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.460
I didn't get to watch it live because of the Europe timeframe.

06:54.460 --> 06:59.580
It was like 11 AM for me and I have a lot going on at work right now.

06:59.580 --> 07:03.060
So I can't like step away to watch something for God.

07:03.060 --> 07:05.980
It was probably like two hours, so it was a long time.

07:05.980 --> 07:06.980
So I got, it was a while.

07:06.980 --> 07:07.980
Yeah.

07:07.980 --> 07:14.980
There's no way I was a little behind to start it, but like I did skip around, um, a bit.

07:14.980 --> 07:18.420
There's a few announcements like, eh, I don't care about that, but like there was a lot

07:18.420 --> 07:21.540
of other things that were interesting, but they, I did, I did watch it.

07:21.540 --> 07:26.660
Some might send my life to Jeff's credit and the whole production team, usually with his

07:26.660 --> 07:29.740
friends, there's some things you're into and some things you're not.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.220
And that's to be expected because he wants to reach a diverse player base.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.220
Right?

07:34.220 --> 07:35.220
So there's going to be a little bit of everything, right?

07:35.220 --> 07:36.220
Yeah.

07:36.220 --> 07:39.220
There's not, it's no, no big deal that like, you know, that stuff's in there.

07:39.220 --> 07:42.740
I mean, there's, it was a lot of great games that were announced.

07:42.740 --> 07:45.000
It wasn't anything like, Oh, that's super boring.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.980
It's more of like, Hey, that looks cool, but I'm not gonna play that.

07:48.980 --> 07:51.180
So let's talk about some of the things that were announced.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.180
Let me start with this.

07:52.180 --> 07:56.420
Cause I know you can run down the whole laundry list, but let me just kind of ask for you

07:56.420 --> 08:00.660
and Jamie, if she has anything, but is there anything that like jumped out that you're

08:00.660 --> 08:06.420
like, Oh, this is interesting to me or was it a surprise?

08:06.420 --> 08:13.220
Surprise the Liza P was surprising as I, Oh, they're making that into a soul's like, okay,

08:13.220 --> 08:14.220
cool.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.220
It is.

08:15.220 --> 08:16.980
It is weird that that's a soul's like, but artistically it does.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.300
I think it looks cool.

08:18.300 --> 08:21.940
I'm pissed off that Sonic frontiers in Japan gets a V tuber.

08:21.940 --> 08:22.940
Really?

08:22.940 --> 08:23.940
Yeah.

08:23.940 --> 08:25.360
Um, not here.

08:25.360 --> 08:30.560
They have a collaboration with like a pretty top of V tuber over there.

08:30.560 --> 08:31.560
Huh?

08:31.560 --> 08:32.560
Interesting.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.560
I'll have to find the information.

08:33.560 --> 08:37.600
I thought I was going to put it in show role and then I decided not to, but I'll, uh, I'll

08:37.600 --> 08:39.080
see if I can find it.

08:39.080 --> 08:47.120
The thing that I was most excited about that was, I should say surprising, um, ironically

08:47.120 --> 08:49.560
enough is killer clowns from outer space.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.800
He's so love that movie.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.280
And so I'm super excited.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.780
I have pretty decent coulrophobia.

08:57.780 --> 09:04.280
So like even in dead by daylight, if I play clown, I, I put the chicken hat on him so

09:04.280 --> 09:05.520
that he doesn't look like a clown.

09:05.520 --> 09:10.160
I was just saying that that purple elephant thing is very, I don't have that cause it

09:10.160 --> 09:11.560
costs dairy shards.

09:11.560 --> 09:17.720
Oh, so I just put him in like a regular like red suit and the chicken hat.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.920
Well, if, if this game comes out on PE, certainly you're not the only one in the world that

09:21.920 --> 09:23.920
has an aversion to clowns.

09:23.920 --> 09:28.240
And I, I, if this game ends up out on PC, I guarantee that's one of the first mods they're

09:28.240 --> 09:29.240
going to make.

09:29.240 --> 09:33.000
I don't know if it'll turn them into chickens, but something, something not really clowns.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
They're aliens.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
But anyway,

09:36.000 --> 09:40.560
so I found, I found, uh, the thing, by the way, real quick about, uh, uh, Sonic frontier

09:40.560 --> 09:49.520
in Japan, uh, the amazon.co.jp pre-order comes with a korone inugami, uh, collaboration,

09:49.520 --> 09:53.440
which is basically, uh, the character in a vtuber outfit.

09:53.440 --> 10:01.520
Um, and the DLC changes the sound effects to, uh, inugami's voice, uh, for geo that

10:01.520 --> 10:08.760
is geo online or game dealer, um, an acrylic panel that has Sonic, uh, x korone inugami

10:08.760 --> 10:18.320
collection illustration, uh, done by artist, uh, hookahire, um, for, uh, joshindenki.

10:18.320 --> 10:25.400
It's uh, uh, korone inugami collaboration DLC, uh, gloves and shoes that Sonic gets

10:25.400 --> 10:26.720
to wear.

10:26.720 --> 10:34.880
And then there's, uh, for Rakuten, there is, uh, koroneski, which is, uh, it changes the

10:34.880 --> 10:44.360
appearance of the Coco character to, uh, koroneski, which is like this kind of laughing head.

10:44.360 --> 10:52.560
I'll put, I'll put the link in here for our, uh, our chat so they can, they can see, uh,

10:52.560 --> 10:53.560
what those look like.

10:53.560 --> 10:57.120
My curiosity has certainly peaked with, um, Sonic Frontiers.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.720
Like I, I know there's a lot of people kind of dogging on the footage that we've seen

10:59.720 --> 11:02.920
so far, but I'm, I'm, I'm open to it.

11:02.920 --> 11:10.200
I, I'm, I, I, I've learned a long time ago to very much not read one way or two or another

11:10.200 --> 11:14.320
too much into these types of previews for good, for better and for worse.

11:14.320 --> 11:20.300
Um, so I, I just want to see, you know, nothing says it like just raw gameplay footage on

11:20.300 --> 11:21.480
YouTube or Twitch.

11:21.480 --> 11:25.240
And that's, you know, what ultimately is going to really, um, make my decision.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.240
So I'm curious about it.

11:26.240 --> 11:30.320
Well that said though, I have seen raw gameplay footage on YouTube and it looked very uninspiring

11:30.320 --> 11:34.600
and boring, but like the whole thing too, like the art styles is very drab as well.

11:34.600 --> 11:38.360
It's like, it screams default Unreal Engine game.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.760
I mean, there's like no distinct art style to it.

11:41.760 --> 11:46.840
Whereas like some of the other 3D Sonic games, even more recent ones are like very stylized

11:46.840 --> 11:47.840
and stuff.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.840
And I liked that.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.640
I think they should be more stylized because right now it just looks so generic and bland.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.400
It doesn't even look like a Sonic game.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.920
So I mean, maybe it'll, maybe it'll pan out and be better, but like, it's just, it's not

11:58.920 --> 12:03.920
leading off with a great, you know, great start.

12:03.920 --> 12:10.160
And funny enough, like as of recently, a lot of these gut feelings that you get end up

12:10.160 --> 12:12.080
holding true in the end.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.600
So we'll see.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.920
Um, before I mentioned the game that caught my attention, I wanted to go back quickly

12:18.920 --> 12:20.760
to the last game we were talking about.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.240
And sorry, Jamie, I know you're not a fan of the subject matter, but I want to focus

12:23.240 --> 12:27.800
on the developers of that game because they made the Friday the 13th game.

12:27.800 --> 12:32.640
And I always thought that game got a raw deal because that game could really be competing

12:32.640 --> 12:39.000
in a sense with Dead by Daylight a little more if it hadn't just gotten destroyed by

12:39.000 --> 12:43.080
trademark and licensing issues of the Friday the 13th franchise.

12:43.080 --> 12:49.360
And ironically, I do think this whole story ends someday with a Friday the 13th chapter

12:49.360 --> 12:50.520
for Dead by Daylight.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.520
Absolutely.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.020
But, but I digress.

12:53.020 --> 12:59.520
The game that came out before that was interesting and was gosh, only about like four or five,

12:59.520 --> 13:02.720
six months before the original Dead by Daylight.

13:02.720 --> 13:07.040
So it did kind of beat DBD to the whole 4v1 thing, although it played very differently.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.040
It was very different.

13:08.040 --> 13:12.120
So I can't, you know, you can't draw a direct line between those two games, but you certainly

13:12.120 --> 13:14.080
can see what they have in common.

13:14.080 --> 13:19.400
So I'm just very curious, okay, if we're going with sci-fi camp now, so obviously, obviously

13:19.400 --> 13:24.960
we can't do horror now because Dead by Daylight's got the lock and you know, all that, but now

13:24.960 --> 13:28.720
to go sci-fi camp with this is, is interesting.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.600
So I'm curious to see what the developers do from that standpoint, because Friday the

13:32.600 --> 13:34.760
13th had a lot of good ideas in it.

13:34.760 --> 13:39.140
So I'm, I'm curious to see if, if it's even the same type of game, it may not be, it may

13:39.140 --> 13:43.360
just end up being a completely different thing, but it is an ace, was it, was it, I think

13:43.360 --> 13:46.000
it's 4v1 on that, this one as well.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.760
So it's, it'd be interesting, it's going to be interesting.

13:48.760 --> 13:49.760
So we'll see.

13:49.760 --> 13:54.560
Anyway, the game that also caught my attention, because literally I felt like this game came

13:54.560 --> 14:03.760
out of nowhere, was Dead Island 2, because to put this into context, the last E3 I went

14:03.760 --> 14:08.920
to, which I want to say was like 2014, I think was the last E3 I went to, I remember going

14:08.920 --> 14:13.140
to behind closed doors to see where this game was at at the time.

14:13.140 --> 14:17.740
So that was eight years ago that I saw that game.

14:17.740 --> 14:21.200
And now like it, I honestly forgot about it.

14:21.200 --> 14:27.240
I think most of us did outside of that Goat Simulator 3, you know, that, that whole thing,

14:27.240 --> 14:30.560
which I maybe was intentional to kind of bring it back to the forefront of mind.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.920
I don't know.

14:31.920 --> 14:36.320
Outside of that, like I had not thought about Dead Island 2 for a long time.

14:36.320 --> 14:41.520
And then all of a sudden, ta-da, it's here and it's dated and done.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.300
And there's a part of me that goes, well, that's neat.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.480
And there's also a part of me that goes, that, that could be really bad because I feel like

14:48.480 --> 14:52.680
that's what happened with Duke Nukem Forever, is that Duke Nukem Forever was gone for a

14:52.680 --> 14:53.680
long time.

14:53.680 --> 14:57.000
And then all of a sudden it was like, it's happening, enjoy.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
And nobody enjoyed.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
It looks polished.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.820
I mean, well, but here's, here's the other thing.

15:02.820 --> 15:05.800
The original Dead Island game, and Bobby and I were just reminiscing about this on his

15:05.800 --> 15:08.560
side, his show, the original Dead Island game.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.240
I wasn't really a fan of that either.

15:10.240 --> 15:14.040
Like I reviewed it for VOG Network and I do not remember giving it a good grade.

15:14.040 --> 15:18.440
Um, no, no, no bikini torso pre-order bonus this time.

15:18.440 --> 15:21.840
But I know it's comfort food for some people, that series.

15:21.840 --> 15:27.040
Like it's, it's, I don't want to say it's trash because that gives a negative context.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.960
But what if I said like, it's Sharknado of games?

15:30.960 --> 15:32.960
Like there's a certain camp.

15:32.960 --> 15:36.420
Yeah, but like, yeah.

15:36.420 --> 15:40.140
But they're kind of like, see the thing with Dead Island though is even kind of annoying

15:40.140 --> 15:47.620
is that it's basically taking the Dead Rising format and just kind of doing that, but first

15:47.620 --> 15:48.620
person.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.540
So I don't know.

15:50.540 --> 15:51.540
It looks all right.

15:51.540 --> 15:55.380
I like the idea of like seven different killers or whatever in there that you can play as,

15:55.380 --> 15:56.380
but eh, whatever.

15:56.380 --> 15:57.380
It's fine.

15:57.380 --> 16:02.300
Uh, dark to see in chat says it does look like a stupid, fun, good time.

16:02.300 --> 16:06.100
And I mean, shouldn't most video games be a little bit stupid?

16:06.100 --> 16:07.900
No, I said most, not all.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.700
There's certainly some, some artistic, you know, pushing forward the medium things and

16:11.700 --> 16:16.380
there's a time and a place for that, but it's, it's okay for a video game to be stupid.

16:16.380 --> 16:18.060
Like, you know, that's, that's okay too.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.080
Just like movies, just like movies, right?

16:21.080 --> 16:23.400
Sometimes you want to sit down and watch an Oscar winner.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.060
Sometimes you want to watch something stupid and that's okay.

16:26.060 --> 16:30.420
Like video games should, should follow that exact same thing for sure.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.860
Pod Culture said, you say Sharknado like it's a bad thing.

16:32.860 --> 16:40.380
I wasn't saying it like it's a bad thing, but it, it, it fills a certain need in the

16:40.380 --> 16:44.740
film industry that I would say Dead Island fills in the video game industry.

16:44.740 --> 16:50.100
Well, I have to say there's exactly three games that grabbed my interest.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.100
Okay.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.100
What's that?

16:52.100 --> 16:53.100
All right.

16:53.100 --> 16:58.300
Well, number one, and I've talked about it before, Vikings on trampolines.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.300
It's a concept.

17:00.660 --> 17:06.860
Um, another one, just given my own kind of history interest is pentiment.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.200
I'm really looking forward to that.

17:09.200 --> 17:13.780
And uh, probably my very, very, very biggest, biggest, biggest thing that I super, super,

17:13.780 --> 17:21.020
super, super, super want to play is uh, Lies of P.

17:21.020 --> 17:24.860
That one, even though, even though that's a Souls-like.

17:24.860 --> 17:26.160
Even though.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.380
You know, you know what, Dark Soccer, this has been-

17:28.380 --> 17:31.860
Just because it's like Souls doesn't mean it has to exactly be as hard as it.

17:31.860 --> 17:32.860
You know what?

17:32.860 --> 17:33.860
And you know what?

17:33.860 --> 17:37.940
This, this is, this is the year to challenge our preconceived perceptions of games because

17:37.940 --> 17:41.140
Dark Soccer, I remember when you wouldn't play first person games and then you were

17:41.140 --> 17:43.060
a killer at Dead by Daylight for-

17:43.060 --> 17:45.300
You know why I was a killer in Dead by Daylight?

17:45.300 --> 17:46.300
I do.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.300
I do.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.300
But-

17:48.300 --> 17:51.420
Because I thought the survivors had to do all kinds of crazy shit and it's true.

17:51.420 --> 17:56.620
They have to do all kinds of crazy shit, but I thought that killer would be easier.

17:56.620 --> 18:01.060
I also started as killer because I was like playing survivors too scary.

18:01.060 --> 18:05.100
But when you're killer, I'm the one in control of the scare and it was, but then

18:05.100 --> 18:06.100
I came around.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.220
But anyway, that's not my point.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.820
My point is we're all challenging our preconceived notions of games.

18:10.820 --> 18:11.820
So why not?

18:11.820 --> 18:12.820
Let's do a Souls-like.

18:12.820 --> 18:19.460
It does look like, I got to say, like the artistic-ness of it, taking a Pinocchio-esque

18:19.460 --> 18:23.420
type of thing and making it this is neat.

18:23.420 --> 18:28.180
Like, you know, I'm more interested in this than the Tom Hanks live-action Pinocchio,

18:28.180 --> 18:29.180
that's for sure.

18:29.180 --> 18:37.460
Well, I mean, Callisto Protocol also is up on my list, you know, because I'm really interested

18:37.460 --> 18:40.220
in seeing the mutation mechanic and what's going on.

18:40.220 --> 18:45.620
I mean, Street Fighter 6 hopefully is better than Street Fighter 5, but, and I've already

18:45.620 --> 18:49.940
been interested in Forspoken, even though I won't have any way to play it, but I'm really

18:49.940 --> 18:51.300
also very interested though.

18:51.300 --> 18:57.620
And I mentioned it was a pentiment because I follow a particular Twitter that's all about

18:57.620 --> 19:03.220
badly drawn medieval animals, like how animals are drawn in medieval manuscripts and this

19:03.220 --> 19:09.020
whole game looks like a medieval manuscript and I'm here for it.

19:09.020 --> 19:15.020
Hey, sometimes it's just that little thing that jumps out at you and you're like, oh,

19:15.020 --> 19:16.020
I got to, I got to see that.

19:16.020 --> 19:17.020
I got to do that.

19:17.100 --> 19:20.460
It's so, it's so just perfect.

19:20.460 --> 19:26.660
Like I'm totally down for it, you know, with monks drawing and, and, you know, people doing

19:26.660 --> 19:31.140
penance and it's just like, it's totally up my alley.

19:31.140 --> 19:36.700
That and hearing about Kojima's podcast, I'm interested in that too.

19:36.700 --> 19:41.880
associate100matt in chat says, Tom Hanks, all the things, here's, here's the thing.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.180
It's not Tom Hanks that I have a problem with.

19:44.180 --> 19:47.740
It's these live action Disney movies I have a problem with because none of them have been

19:47.740 --> 19:48.740
good.

19:48.740 --> 19:50.660
None of them have exceeded the original animation.

19:50.660 --> 19:51.660
None of them.

19:51.660 --> 19:54.940
I'm very concerned about the little mermaid and this has nothing to do with the casting

19:54.940 --> 19:55.940
of Ariel.

19:55.940 --> 19:59.220
I'm fine with that, but it does have everything to do with the casting of Ursula because it

19:59.220 --> 20:01.860
should have been a drag queen, but I digress.

20:01.860 --> 20:02.860
Fine.

20:02.860 --> 20:08.140
Melissa McCarthy is close to a drag queen, but it's not going to be good.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.380
It's not going to be good.

20:09.380 --> 20:10.780
None of them have been good.

20:10.780 --> 20:12.380
Aladdin was terrible.

20:12.380 --> 20:13.380
Beauty and the Beast.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.780
I almost walked out of that after the first 15 minutes.

20:15.780 --> 20:16.780
It was so bad.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.780
Lion King.

20:17.780 --> 20:18.780
Not good.

20:18.780 --> 20:21.600
Those Disney, none of those Disney live action remakes are good.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.600
None of them.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.700
So I don't know why this one's going to be any different.

20:24.700 --> 20:32.420
Well, I mean, they did give you a drag, a fairy in the, uh, was it live action Pinocchio?

20:32.420 --> 20:35.380
Oh, Oh, that's right.

20:35.380 --> 20:36.380
That's right.

20:36.380 --> 20:37.380
Who is playing it?

20:37.380 --> 20:38.380
I don't know.

20:38.380 --> 20:40.460
I forget, but it doesn't matter.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.620
Wrong person asked about that.

20:42.220 --> 20:44.000
It doesn't, you know, it doesn't matter.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.260
It's still not going to be good.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.260
It is.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.260
It's so yeah.

20:47.260 --> 20:48.260
Yeah.

20:48.260 --> 20:50.740
It, that almost, no offense, but like, it seems almost pandering at that point.

20:50.740 --> 20:54.180
It's like, well, let's just give them a reason to watch this because otherwise it's going

20:54.180 --> 20:55.180
to be crap.

20:55.180 --> 20:56.220
You know, like, I don't know.

20:56.220 --> 20:59.700
It's um, bonds, double 06 says even Cruella.

20:59.700 --> 21:00.700
Okay.

21:00.700 --> 21:01.700
Technicality.

21:01.700 --> 21:02.740
That wasn't a remake.

21:02.740 --> 21:08.900
That was, that also wasn't just a certain like, and Glenn Close in 101 Dalmatians and

21:08.900 --> 21:13.100
that movie, I don't throw in with this recent trend that was in the nineties.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.100
Okay.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.660
I'm talking about the more recent trend.

21:15.660 --> 21:21.540
We'll, we'll forgive Glenn Close because she's Glenn Close and you know, Cruella was more

21:21.540 --> 21:26.420
of an original story, but um, yeah, these other more modern remakes anyway, I digress.

21:26.420 --> 21:30.460
We're talking about video games, but I get me started on Disney and I will go off on

21:30.460 --> 21:31.460
Disney.

21:31.460 --> 21:32.460
Okay.

21:32.460 --> 21:38.100
Anyway, uh, Loki, um, I know dark soccer named a lot of stuff there.

21:38.140 --> 21:43.340
I named, what else did we miss that we should talk about from the Gamescom opening ceremony?

21:43.340 --> 21:45.340
I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff.

21:45.340 --> 21:49.300
They have a new, they have a game coming out for Dune, Dune Awakening that looks pretty

21:49.300 --> 21:50.300
awesome.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.300
MMO, isn't it?

21:51.300 --> 21:52.300
Yeah, it is.

21:52.300 --> 21:53.300
And that could be interesting.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.300
Yeah.

21:54.300 --> 21:59.700
I'm just going to, if I made a character in that, she'd just sit around high on spice.

21:59.700 --> 22:03.180
Her eyes glowing blue, staring vacantly out into the dirt.

22:04.060 --> 22:08.420
Now I'm going to have to make a lady character in that game too, so that dark soccer and

22:08.420 --> 22:13.740
I can have a Guild called the spice girls like, and I'm sure we're not the only ones

22:13.740 --> 22:18.900
thinking this, but I'm hoping we're the first to say it on a podcast.

22:18.900 --> 22:24.900
And so I'm going to say patent pending trademark, um, copyright names in the game have to be

22:24.900 --> 22:33.140
like off-brand spice girl names, like, like you can be like pumpkin spice and, and I

22:33.140 --> 22:37.380
can be, uh, we need a dude to be old spice.

22:37.380 --> 22:38.380
I mean, okay.

22:38.380 --> 22:39.380
Loki can be old spice.

22:39.380 --> 22:43.620
Look, you'll be old spice and I'll be, I'll be pumpkin spice.

22:43.620 --> 22:47.180
I'll be a spiced latte.

22:47.180 --> 22:49.460
I was just, I was going to say sugar cake.

22:49.460 --> 22:50.460
I'll be spice cake.

22:50.460 --> 22:51.460
Okay.

22:51.460 --> 22:53.660
How about spiced rum?

22:54.540 --> 22:55.540
Yeah.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.540
There you go.

22:56.540 --> 22:57.540
I'll be spiced rum.

22:57.540 --> 23:00.140
Sometimes your friends know you better than you know yourself.

23:00.140 --> 23:02.180
Or I could be spicy snack.

23:02.180 --> 23:03.180
There you go.

23:03.180 --> 23:04.180
All right.

23:04.180 --> 23:06.680
Who's in, who's in for our spice girls Guild.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.460
Who's in a show of hands and chat.

23:08.460 --> 23:09.460
Who's in, wow.

23:09.460 --> 23:10.460
Nobody's talking.

23:10.460 --> 23:11.460
What's good.

23:11.460 --> 23:12.460
Is there, are we broadcasting?

23:12.460 --> 23:13.460
Hello.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.460
Hello.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.460
Okay.

23:15.460 --> 23:19.700
So pod culture has to be, um, 11 herbs and spices.

23:19.700 --> 23:20.700
That's right.

23:20.740 --> 23:24.700
There will be a character named herb and come up with, and then there will be 11 herbs in

23:24.700 --> 23:26.180
the Guild and then spices.

23:26.180 --> 23:27.180
Perfect.

23:27.180 --> 23:29.180
It'd be in apostrophe spice.

23:29.180 --> 23:31.140
All right.

23:31.140 --> 23:36.820
Anyway, so yes, Dune is getting an MMO and now we're, we're going to make it ridiculous,

23:36.820 --> 23:39.900
which again, video games can be stupid.

23:39.900 --> 23:43.580
Lululemon is not fucking designer and you misspelled Chanel.

23:43.580 --> 23:44.580
I'm just saying.

23:44.580 --> 23:48.100
Levi's is also not designer.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.380
I'm just saying.

23:51.380 --> 23:55.860
You only, you only have a couple on there that are actually, and honestly, for, uh,

23:55.860 --> 24:01.940
for Cruella, I got a little bit more from Sharperelli and maybe a hint of Valentino.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.940
So just saying.

24:03.940 --> 24:04.940
Okay.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.420
This is a gaming podcast once in a while.

24:07.420 --> 24:09.220
All right.

24:09.220 --> 24:10.220
What else?

24:10.220 --> 24:17.740
Hey, Hey, Sailor Moon's outfits in the anime were all based off of lots of fashion design

24:17.740 --> 24:19.180
at the time in the nineties.

24:19.180 --> 24:24.740
Let's talk about Sailor Moon for a minute.

24:24.740 --> 24:26.940
And I had it.

24:26.940 --> 24:27.940
No, I will leave.

24:27.940 --> 24:31.580
I will leave all the talk about Sabin Sailor Moon to the experts at anime jam session.

24:31.580 --> 24:37.540
So Dan and I actually talked about that this morning, just a little tangent.

24:37.540 --> 24:44.620
I woke up this morning and I hear the Jason, the wield warriors theme song, and Dan was

24:44.620 --> 24:48.980
on a kick of listening to eighties cartoon theme songs.

24:48.980 --> 24:53.900
And we listened to pole position and, uh, the mysterious cities of gold.

24:53.900 --> 24:57.540
And we're like, you know what, we can't enjoy this show anymore now that we're adults and

24:57.540 --> 24:58.540
no history.

24:58.540 --> 25:09.460
Um, but it was just like, and somehow we got on the topic of Sabin doing, uh, uh, um, the

25:09.460 --> 25:12.700
Sailor Moon and we like, we're like, wasn't it Deke that did it?

25:12.700 --> 25:13.700
Wasn't Sabin involved with Deke?

25:13.700 --> 25:14.700
Was blah, blah, blah.

25:14.700 --> 25:15.700
And went back and forth.

25:15.700 --> 25:19.740
And that was like our whole discussion this morning whilst listening to the kid video

25:19.740 --> 25:20.740
theme song.

25:20.740 --> 25:22.340
Oh, you want a tangent?

25:22.340 --> 25:23.340
You want a tangent honey?

25:23.340 --> 25:24.340
One more.

25:24.340 --> 25:25.340
I got a tangent for you.

25:25.340 --> 25:26.340
Okay.

25:26.340 --> 25:27.340
One more.

25:27.340 --> 25:28.340
And then you can take the tangent.

25:28.340 --> 25:29.340
All right.

25:29.340 --> 25:35.380
So, um, in talking, uh, crap.

25:35.380 --> 25:39.300
Now I forgot what I was going to say Bionic six was nineties.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.300
Wasn't it?

25:40.300 --> 25:42.620
Um, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

25:42.620 --> 25:48.460
I was going to say something about it now and I just, thanks, Rob.

25:48.460 --> 25:49.460
I'm sorry.

25:49.460 --> 25:50.460
Okay.

25:50.460 --> 25:53.780
Do I, do I, do I get to do my piece now?

25:53.780 --> 25:54.780
Fine.

25:54.780 --> 25:57.500
And if I remember it halfway through what you're saying, I'll repeat it.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.500
Okay.

25:58.500 --> 26:02.220
So all aboard the tangent train, Rob Roberts conducting choo choo.

26:02.220 --> 26:03.220
Here we go.

26:03.220 --> 26:04.220
Okay.

26:04.220 --> 26:09.500
So you were talking about eighties cartoons earlier this week, I got into a Twitter fight

26:09.500 --> 26:11.220
with the County of Sacramento.

26:11.220 --> 26:14.700
Yes, that is exactly what happened.

26:14.700 --> 26:19.440
I got into a Twitter fight with the County of Sacramento, where we live.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.660
And let me tell you a little bit about this fight.

26:21.660 --> 26:22.660
Okay.

26:22.660 --> 26:23.660
Here's what happened during this fight.

26:23.660 --> 26:30.260
So I had a heart attack because they pushed an alert to everybody in Sacramento County

26:30.260 --> 26:36.820
with this horrible noise, like the emergency alert noise, which I call the brown note.

26:36.820 --> 26:40.980
I call the brown note because it makes you poop because it makes you sound like a tornado

26:40.980 --> 26:42.260
is going off somewhere.

26:42.260 --> 26:43.260
Okay.

26:43.260 --> 26:44.260
Hold, I promised a tangent train.

26:44.260 --> 26:45.620
I'm giving you a tangent train.

26:45.620 --> 26:51.260
So I tweet and I say this fricking, I said the heart attack I just had with both my phones

26:51.260 --> 26:55.180
making that hideous noise in unison, thanks a lot for the heads up.

26:55.180 --> 26:58.700
And then I realized right after I wrote that, oh, I guess on their Twitter account, they

26:58.700 --> 27:00.420
did give a heads up.

27:00.420 --> 27:05.460
And then look at me being dragged and exposed by the County, that literally the County tweets

27:05.460 --> 27:12.640
at me, give us a follow and avoid inconvenience in the future with the upside down smile emoji.

27:12.640 --> 27:19.900
And so I, as, as one does, I replied with, I just write, I replied, drag me because I

27:19.900 --> 27:23.980
drag me, expose me, make me write bad checks because that's drag.

27:23.980 --> 27:27.860
I would have put drag me mommy, but I didn't want to assume the County's gender.

27:27.860 --> 27:29.020
So I just put drag me.

27:29.020 --> 27:30.020
Okay.

27:30.020 --> 27:31.020
Cause that's, that's what I deserved.

27:31.020 --> 27:32.020
All right.

27:32.020 --> 27:33.020
So they replied-

27:33.020 --> 27:34.020
I heard the light.

27:34.580 --> 27:37.980
I heard it as eat me, beat me, make me write bad checks.

27:37.980 --> 27:42.660
They replied with a GIF of Lilo and Stitch and Stitch getting dragged.

27:42.660 --> 27:49.380
Travis Donovan from understation live jumps in and says, come on, Rob, I live 1,700 miles

27:49.380 --> 27:50.380
away.

27:50.380 --> 27:54.780
And even I knew it was coming with a GIF of GI Joe saying, knowing is half the battle

27:54.780 --> 27:58.660
to which here we go tangent train about to reach his destination.

27:58.660 --> 28:01.900
I replied saying, I never learned that lesson.

28:01.980 --> 28:06.860
I was too busy watching Jem and the Holograms.

28:06.860 --> 28:08.740
I want to point out who likes this tweet.

28:08.740 --> 28:10.180
And I remember what I was going to say.

28:10.180 --> 28:11.740
Who likes this tweet?

28:11.740 --> 28:12.740
The County of Sacramento.

28:12.740 --> 28:13.740
Okay.

28:13.740 --> 28:18.580
So now I remember what I was going to say.

28:18.580 --> 28:23.960
While we were listening, Dan had played the kid video thing, except it was like all instrumental.

28:23.960 --> 28:28.140
So we were doing all of the lines back and forth from the other room.

28:29.140 --> 28:33.060
We still remembered how the whole introduction to that show went.

28:33.060 --> 28:37.060
That's not as funny as what you said, but it was a return.

28:37.060 --> 28:38.060
No, it's fine.

28:38.060 --> 28:39.700
Once you start a story, you have to finish it.

28:39.700 --> 28:40.860
It's the rules of a party.

28:40.860 --> 28:42.540
It is the rules.

28:42.540 --> 28:46.820
Going to the chat, Tigerclaw in chat says, I guess that means they are Jem fans.

28:46.820 --> 28:50.060
Well, Tigerclaw, anyone with taste would be.

28:50.060 --> 28:53.860
She was just simply, she was just truly outrageous.

28:53.860 --> 28:57.020
Truly, truly, truly outrageous.

28:57.020 --> 28:58.900
And then Darktitsia says, I'm sorry.

28:58.900 --> 29:01.180
That was totally worth retelling, right?

29:01.180 --> 29:05.540
I want to give a big shout out again to everybody listening to OLR for the very first time.

29:05.540 --> 29:11.300
Thanks to Dragon Con and the video game track panels I may have been moderating at the show.

29:11.300 --> 29:14.300
Welcome to your video game three hour podcast.

29:14.300 --> 29:18.820
And you might, you might've asked yourself before hitting subscribe, how, how do they

29:18.820 --> 29:23.660
talk about video games for three hours on a podcast?

29:23.660 --> 29:24.660
Gotcha bitch.

29:24.660 --> 29:25.660
Okay.

29:25.660 --> 29:26.660
Where were we?

29:26.660 --> 29:27.660
Oh, yes.

29:27.660 --> 29:35.660
Do you want to know how tangenty my brain works just for the record?

29:35.660 --> 29:39.780
When y'all were talking about Tom Hanks, I had it in my head that he was in a movie about

29:39.780 --> 29:42.780
a guy who is made socially invisible.

29:42.780 --> 29:46.220
And it turned out it wasn't Tom Hanks in it at all, but I remember it being Tom Hanks.

29:46.220 --> 29:47.220
It was some different guy.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.820
And it was an episode of the Twilight Zone.

29:49.820 --> 29:56.300
Like from God, the eighties or nineties, and it was called, uh, uh, to see the invisible

29:56.300 --> 29:57.300
man.

29:57.300 --> 29:58.660
I can't breathe.

29:58.660 --> 29:59.660
Yeah.

29:59.660 --> 30:05.620
I just went and looked all of that up while you were talking about Tom Hanks movies, because

30:05.620 --> 30:09.860
that's where my brain went.

30:09.860 --> 30:18.620
And if anybody has seen that episode of Twilight Zone, talk to me, I'm done.

30:18.620 --> 30:19.620
What else is doing this?

30:19.620 --> 30:21.340
The game's called Loki.

30:21.340 --> 30:25.740
Um, well, Hammer, Return of the Monkey Island.

30:25.740 --> 30:30.140
They had some more footage of that, including, uh, Dan.

30:30.140 --> 30:31.140
I love Stan.

30:31.140 --> 30:32.140
Stan's great.

30:32.140 --> 30:35.860
They should make a whole game with Stan in it, but like, you know, I'll take this.

30:35.860 --> 30:36.860
Um,

30:36.860 --> 30:37.860
Hey, Loki.

30:37.860 --> 30:38.860
What about recreation?

30:38.860 --> 30:39.860
Recreation?

30:39.860 --> 30:40.860
Yeah.

30:40.860 --> 30:46.700
It's, uh, an open world racing game that lets you do like burnout shit.

30:46.700 --> 30:47.700
Oh yeah.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.700
That looks good.

30:48.700 --> 30:49.700
W.R.E.T.

30:49.700 --> 30:50.700
C.K.

30:50.700 --> 30:51.700
Reation.

30:51.700 --> 30:56.540
Oh, um, I don't remember that one, but yeah, that sounds cool.

30:56.540 --> 30:57.940
I think we talked about that though.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.260
Like a game called dredge.

30:59.260 --> 31:01.740
And I wondered if, you know, the main character hidden lockers.

31:01.740 --> 31:07.380
It might also be something that like, she's citing from like the floor at gamescom that

31:07.380 --> 31:08.380
people are playing.

31:08.380 --> 31:09.660
And that wasn't an opening night live.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.660
Yeah.

31:10.660 --> 31:11.660
I think it wasn't recreation.

31:11.660 --> 31:13.580
The one that was like the old, uh, burnout devs and stuff like that.

31:13.580 --> 31:14.580
I think it is them.

31:14.580 --> 31:15.580
Yeah.

31:15.580 --> 31:16.580
Yeah.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.460
Cause I would have remembered that.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.860
Um, but what else, uh, goat simulator three had a gameplay trailer.

31:22.860 --> 31:23.860
Looks awesome.

31:23.860 --> 31:24.860
Can't wait.

31:24.860 --> 31:31.380
Um, they had, I think, uh, the outlast trials, uh, which is going to have a closed beta in

31:31.380 --> 31:32.380
October.

31:32.380 --> 31:34.380
Um, what is it?

31:34.380 --> 31:40.900
A new trailer for Gotham nights, which would be out a little bit in October 21st.

31:40.900 --> 31:47.460
Um, dying light two has some DLC coming that they showed off that kind of looked like thunder

31:47.460 --> 31:48.460
dome.

31:48.460 --> 31:50.460
So that's kind of neat.

31:50.460 --> 31:52.340
Um, what else?

31:52.340 --> 31:58.140
Um, I'm trying to think there was friends versus friends.

31:58.140 --> 32:00.580
Oh, everywhere that looked interesting.

32:00.580 --> 32:08.380
Like some sort of space survival game, um, more, uh, the Callisto protocol, I love all

32:08.380 --> 32:12.380
the violence there and they, they always end it with the player getting killed in some

32:12.380 --> 32:13.380
brutal way.

32:13.380 --> 32:19.820
I love those that in the trailers, um, they have a telltale series for the expanse.

32:19.820 --> 32:22.340
Oh yeah.

32:22.340 --> 32:27.220
I have some friends that don't talk about gaming a lot, but like, well actually it's

32:27.220 --> 32:28.220
my Ingers friends.

32:28.220 --> 32:30.860
So they took, they do talk about that game, but they don't talk about like console games

32:30.860 --> 32:32.580
a lot or PC games.

32:32.580 --> 32:36.140
But there was a few of them that saw that expanse tell, and they were like, Oh, I'm

32:36.140 --> 32:37.140
all about this.

32:37.140 --> 32:38.620
Cause they, they love the show.

32:38.620 --> 32:39.620
Yeah.

32:39.620 --> 32:45.460
Uh, and then speaking of old telltale games, there is the new tales of the borderlands,

32:45.460 --> 32:52.220
uh, or new tales from the borderlands, which cool.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.180
Like it's neat.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.180
I mean, I don't know.

32:55.180 --> 33:00.420
I never played the original and kind of over board lands of it, but cool though.

33:00.420 --> 33:01.420
Cause I,

33:01.420 --> 33:02.580
but it was one of the better telltale games, believe it or not.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.220
It was pretty good.

33:04.220 --> 33:05.220
Yeah.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.020
Uh, so that, that was neat, I guess.

33:07.020 --> 33:12.660
And then what else, uh, I don't know.

33:12.660 --> 33:13.660
There's a lot of other trailers.

33:13.660 --> 33:19.780
So like, I know, like, um, they mentioned that Atlas fallen, which looks interesting.

33:19.780 --> 33:25.340
It also kind of souls, like looking, uh, friends versus friends, which I'm not really sure

33:25.340 --> 33:30.860
what that's supposed to be like, but just like a FPS cartoony looking game, uh, Lords

33:30.860 --> 33:31.860
of fallen.

33:32.020 --> 33:36.220
They have, uh, they're rebooting the hat, which I don't remember what that game was

33:36.220 --> 33:37.220
like.

33:37.220 --> 33:43.460
I don't think it's that old either that get the original came out in 2014.

33:43.460 --> 33:49.300
So about the time they announced that I went to originally, yeah, pretty much a new pirate

33:49.300 --> 33:50.300
game.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.980
Tortuga, the pirate's tail or a pirate's tail.

33:52.980 --> 33:53.980
I'm sorry.

33:53.980 --> 33:57.780
I just realized that boss name in the mega man game playing behind you is creamery man.

33:58.300 --> 34:02.020
I'm like, they're, they're really having to stretch for some new days.

34:02.020 --> 34:03.020
Aren't they?

34:03.020 --> 34:08.820
There's a lot of like interesting bosses.

34:08.820 --> 34:13.060
I guess they probably tried to do creamy man and realize that probably is not the name

34:13.060 --> 34:14.180
they should pick.

34:14.180 --> 34:18.320
So they had to, it's all ice cream flavor or no, I guess it's very much like an ice

34:18.320 --> 34:23.780
cream parlor type of thing, robot thing, but it's just, it's interesting how they decided

34:23.780 --> 34:30.980
creamery man because creamy man might've, might've read wrong ice cream man, but yeah.

34:30.980 --> 34:31.980
Anyway.

34:31.980 --> 34:32.980
All right.

34:32.980 --> 34:33.980
Gamescom.

34:33.980 --> 34:39.920
And then of course the Pokemon car, you know, Pokemon car.

34:39.920 --> 34:40.920
Because why not?

34:40.920 --> 34:41.920
Why not?

34:41.920 --> 34:43.960
We just talked about a car you're never going to own last week on the show.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.460
Why not throw another one in?

34:45.460 --> 34:46.460
Yeah.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.460
Yeah.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.460
All right.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.460
Enough about gamescom.

34:49.460 --> 34:52.460
I'm sure we will touch on more of these highlights as we move on throughout the show.

34:52.540 --> 34:57.700
I will mention some comments from chat, uh, fifth dream talking about the Pokemon car

34:57.700 --> 34:58.940
says I want that car.

34:58.940 --> 34:59.940
Someone buy it for me.

34:59.940 --> 35:02.340
Uh, SG100Matt says high on life.

35:02.340 --> 35:06.900
The FPS from the minds of Rick and Morty creators talking weapons showed some gameplay.

35:06.900 --> 35:11.020
This'll either be the most obnoxious game or quickly forgotten.

35:11.020 --> 35:13.660
I'm strangely intrigued by it though.

35:13.660 --> 35:16.540
So all right.

35:16.540 --> 35:20.540
Pixel Pacas in chat says they call ice cream creameries in Vermont.

35:20.540 --> 35:23.900
I mean, I've heard that used before.

35:23.900 --> 35:24.900
Cold stone creamery.

35:24.900 --> 35:25.900
Yeah.

35:25.900 --> 35:26.900
Cold stone creamery is the thing.

35:26.900 --> 35:27.900
Yeah.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.660
And, and, uh, as a, who was it?

35:29.660 --> 35:32.540
Evan back in the day would say leather boys.

35:32.540 --> 35:36.500
Well, that's, that's very niche to NorCal too.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.500
It's yeah.

35:37.500 --> 35:38.500
Yeah.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.900
Cause I say the first time I went back East, somebody was like, do you want to go to friendlies?

35:41.900 --> 35:43.900
I was like, what's that?

35:43.900 --> 35:45.260
That and they're like, it's, it's ice cream.

35:45.260 --> 35:46.260
I'm like, what?

35:46.260 --> 35:47.260
I've never heard it.

35:47.260 --> 35:48.260
Cause I guess, you know, it's a huge thing.

35:48.260 --> 35:49.260
Yeah.

35:49.260 --> 35:50.260
Yeah.

35:50.260 --> 35:51.260
They have one in the Bay area.

35:51.260 --> 35:53.260
I thought that was the Bay area one.

35:53.260 --> 35:54.260
No, no, no.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.260
There was a different place.

35:55.260 --> 35:56.700
No friendlies is like only like back East.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.260
I'd never seen them here.

35:58.260 --> 35:59.260
Yeah.

35:59.260 --> 36:00.260
So anyway.

36:00.260 --> 36:01.260
All right.

36:01.260 --> 36:05.300
Jamie, Jamie, have you heard of a game called dinkum?

36:05.300 --> 36:06.820
I don't know if it's on Mac yet.

36:06.820 --> 36:11.780
I know it's on PC, but it's basically like animal crossing.

36:11.780 --> 36:13.380
If we were to strip out the,

36:13.380 --> 36:21.420
Yeah, I have heard of that, but it's not, it's like you're out living in the Outback

36:21.420 --> 36:22.420
or something.

36:22.420 --> 36:23.420
Kind of.

36:23.420 --> 36:24.420
Yes.

36:24.420 --> 36:25.420
Yes.

36:25.420 --> 36:26.420
It is Australian.

36:26.420 --> 36:27.420
All right.

36:27.420 --> 36:29.500
Well, I want to get to our gaming weeks because I know dark soccer has been playing another

36:29.500 --> 36:34.580
game that some have called the animal crossing inspired, but it's nothing animal crossing.

36:34.580 --> 36:35.580
All right.

36:35.580 --> 36:36.580
Yeah.

36:36.580 --> 36:38.420
That was kind of what I got out of it too, but dark soccer wants to tell us about your

36:38.420 --> 36:40.060
gaming week.

36:40.060 --> 36:42.700
So I will start with the usuals.

36:42.700 --> 36:52.460
I been playing final fantasy for, I just lost the twins last night, sad face.

36:52.460 --> 36:58.820
Of course, dead by daylight, working through, trying to get my blood points saved up.

36:58.820 --> 37:03.420
In fact, I need to actually just start holding onto them for the 30th for when I dish out

37:03.420 --> 37:11.820
money for cosmetics and DLC for resident evil project W where we get Wesker as the bad guy,

37:11.820 --> 37:18.540
which did I not say Wesker was going to be the killer on the last resident evil patch.

37:18.540 --> 37:19.940
Remember I said that.

37:19.940 --> 37:22.740
Well, yeah, I mean, there's only so many choices.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.740
Yeah.

37:23.740 --> 37:30.460
I knew it was either going to be him tyrant or, um, or nemesis.

37:30.460 --> 37:34.940
And people were saying, Oh no, it's going to be, uh, Alexia code Veronica, blah, blah,

37:34.940 --> 37:35.940
blah.

37:35.940 --> 37:36.940
I'm like, no.

37:36.940 --> 37:39.340
Um, but I knew it was going to be Wesker and Wesker did come out.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.340
And so I was right.

37:40.340 --> 37:47.380
And I called that shit and now we're getting Ada, Shiva, um, Carlos and Rebecca.

37:47.380 --> 37:50.860
So I'm really, I'm really just jazzed about that.

37:50.860 --> 37:56.100
Um, but I also played cult of the lamb.

37:56.100 --> 37:59.820
I was going to stream for three hours that night.

37:59.820 --> 38:05.180
I streamed for five, five hours.

38:05.180 --> 38:09.900
I stopped at two 30 in the fucking morning.

38:09.900 --> 38:12.020
It's addictive.

38:12.020 --> 38:17.380
You don't say I'm not super great at the combat just because, you know, my, my wrist hurt.

38:17.380 --> 38:18.500
I am playing on the controller.

38:18.500 --> 38:24.540
It's actually really easy on a controller, but, um, it's so fun because like your fucking

38:24.540 --> 38:26.780
people are demanding.

38:26.780 --> 38:31.460
And um, I didn't have too many people, uh, watching while I was playing it just, you

38:31.460 --> 38:37.640
know, in and out, but, uh, Finaro was my, uh, first cultist and her cultist ended up

38:37.640 --> 38:39.940
like hating me and leaving.

38:39.940 --> 38:48.460
Oh, so, uh, I will be playing this tomorrow night after, after work at eight Pacific time.

38:48.460 --> 38:54.340
And I would love it if listeners would come in and be cultists.

38:54.340 --> 38:57.100
You're literally asking the listeners to join your cult.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.040
I'm asking the listeners to join my cult.

38:59.040 --> 39:06.720
My cult is called the fantasy zone because of course it is, um, but I, um, I've got to

39:06.720 --> 39:13.880
do a lot more just like farming for myself in the game so that I can get enough hearts

39:13.880 --> 39:17.940
and whatnot to go fight the boss of the second stage.

39:17.940 --> 39:19.200
So I'm getting into it.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.800
I'm trying to get my people happy.

39:20.800 --> 39:27.400
We already have the sacrifice, your cultists, um, we have the feast, we have a funeral.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.440
My favorite is sacrificing somebody.

39:29.440 --> 39:30.440
Okay.

39:30.440 --> 39:34.400
So you come out and everyone's like, put those on their hoods and everything.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.160
When you're in, you give your sermon, you do all that.

39:36.160 --> 39:41.360
And then you do a ritual, which if you do sacrifice, they all, uh, throw on these hoods

39:41.360 --> 39:42.960
and you don't know who it is.

39:42.960 --> 39:46.960
And then when you pick the person, they throw off their hood with a big old grin on their

39:46.960 --> 39:50.360
face and everyone's like, yay, stab.

39:50.360 --> 39:52.880
And they're like, yay.

39:52.880 --> 40:04.360
It might be like that South Park episode, Oh God, Woodling Critter, Christmas type thing.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.520
I absolutely love it.

40:06.520 --> 40:16.200
And um, and I actually managed to get into my Dead by Daylight account on Steam and all

40:16.200 --> 40:24.120
of my, uh, progress that I made on, um, on Stadia, like my achievements there, none of

40:24.120 --> 40:31.960
them came over, except for like the, the P 50 one did before.

40:31.960 --> 40:40.520
Um, and my level ones, but I, I fully thought that all of my achievements from Stadia would

40:40.520 --> 40:41.520
carry over.

40:41.520 --> 40:47.280
Cosmetics did, oddly enough, my, my, while my eerie shards and my blood points carried

40:47.280 --> 40:52.480
over my RX cells did not.

40:52.480 --> 41:00.380
So I will be staying on Stadia for the foreseeable future, but the way that I accessed it was

41:00.380 --> 41:05.480
through, um, the Nvidia thing.

41:05.480 --> 41:10.240
I have to say it does not look good through Nvidia.

41:10.240 --> 41:17.560
It does not it's, it's fuzzy and a little pixely whereas, I mean, and again, it could

41:17.560 --> 41:25.480
be a thing because I'm on Stadia pro, but my, my graphics on Stadia pro are like ultra

41:25.480 --> 41:26.480
and it's beautiful.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.480
So interesting.

41:27.480 --> 41:28.480
Yeah.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.480
So there's, there's that.

41:29.480 --> 41:30.480
Um, so, okay.

41:30.480 --> 41:31.480
All right.

41:31.480 --> 41:38.960
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, I will toss it over to Loki.

41:38.960 --> 41:39.960
How was your gaming week?

41:40.680 --> 41:44.400
Well, I played things other than Minecraft.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.400
You did it.

41:45.400 --> 41:46.400
Oh yeah.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.400
Oh yes.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
Oh yes.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.600
I've been waiting all week to ask you about a particular game that came out this week

41:50.600 --> 41:52.600
because I've seen the tweets.

41:52.600 --> 42:00.760
So I, I, I played, uh, when I played Minecraft, I played, um, some fashion police squad, um,

42:00.760 --> 42:06.840
in the process of debugging stuff from the other game, which I played, which was saints

42:06.840 --> 42:07.840
row.

42:08.080 --> 42:12.640
So it hasn't been good.

42:12.640 --> 42:20.680
Um, the saints row, like if you've seen any of the reviews, it's an incredibly buggy and

42:20.680 --> 42:22.760
under polished game.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.980
It's just, it's really bad.

42:24.980 --> 42:29.060
Like to a point where it's not, not like funny, bad.

42:29.060 --> 42:31.480
It's like bad, broken, bad.

42:31.480 --> 42:37.360
And so that aside, because I haven't, didn't really hit any tech, my heart, one technical

42:37.360 --> 42:43.440
hurdle I hit was that trying to play the game with my wireless controller.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.280
Um, the controls aren't mapped correctly.

42:46.280 --> 42:49.120
So not that like it wasn't mapped correctly.

42:49.120 --> 42:54.280
Like I had the re configure my controller that the button prompts were incorrect.

42:54.280 --> 42:58.800
So it read, you know, like I was pushing the a button and read that as the B button B was

42:58.800 --> 43:07.320
X, X was a, um, the directional, the analog stick was the wrong analog stick and it was

43:07.320 --> 43:08.320
inversed.

43:08.320 --> 43:12.480
Um, the right trigger was start.

43:12.480 --> 43:19.200
So it was all fucked up, basically, um, plugging it in, solve that problem and fixed it now,

43:19.200 --> 43:20.880
which I don't understand.

43:20.880 --> 43:24.920
If I go into steam with a wireless controller, it plays just fine.

43:24.920 --> 43:28.160
It doesn't give a crap if it's plugged in or wireless because it's a competent piece

43:28.160 --> 43:34.280
of software, saints rose, fucking bullshit, but the technical stuff aside, let's talk

43:34.280 --> 43:36.120
about the writing.

43:36.120 --> 43:43.240
They have somehow by like some sheer ineptitude, have found a way to make you actually hate

43:43.240 --> 43:44.720
your main character.

43:44.720 --> 43:48.320
Like you see your main character acting out stuff in the thing.

43:48.320 --> 43:52.520
It's like, Holy shit, I hate this person and this is the person that I'm playing it.

43:52.520 --> 43:56.240
I don't want to play as this person because this person is a fucking idiot.

43:56.240 --> 44:00.920
And so that, that is the start of the, the game itself.

44:00.920 --> 44:03.800
Not to mention that the gameplay is kind of meh as it is.

44:03.840 --> 44:09.240
I actually, this game made me like Saints Row 4 better and Saints Row 4 wasn't great.

44:09.240 --> 44:12.360
I mean, like, it's just, it's so awful.

44:12.360 --> 44:14.720
Like the characters are so goddamn awful.

44:14.720 --> 44:15.960
I don't like any of them.

44:15.960 --> 44:17.080
I hate all of them.

44:17.080 --> 44:22.080
It hasn't gotten any better since they initially showed them they are awful characters.

44:22.080 --> 44:23.660
They are not the saints.

44:23.660 --> 44:26.760
I don't give a shit if this is a reboot and they're forming the saints.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.440
They're fucking idiots.

44:28.440 --> 44:30.400
You reject, you reject this game.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.560
They're seriously idiots.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.640
Let's talk about the original Saints Row.

44:33.640 --> 44:35.840
It's the original Saints Row they were gang bangers.

44:35.840 --> 44:40.840
Like each person in the gang, like was,

44:40.880 --> 44:44.360
they have their own personalities, but they were ruthless people.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.680
They were just like, you know what?

44:46.680 --> 44:48.240
I don't take shit from anybody.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.320
And that's what it was.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.240
That's what the game's supposed to make you feel like.

44:51.240 --> 44:53.240
Like, I don't take shit from anybody.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.000
I'm going to go fuck these other gangs up.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.320
That's how you're supposed to feel playing Saints Row.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.520
This shit is fucking awful.

44:59.520 --> 45:04.520
It's just like, oh, oh, we don't have enough money to make our rent.

45:05.240 --> 45:08.240
Oh, well, let's go knock off a payday loans place.

45:08.240 --> 45:09.000
Okay, cool.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.040
Now we could go buy, I want to buy a $300 waffle maker.

45:13.040 --> 45:15.600
Cause I really like waffles.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.480
Waffles are pretty good, Loki.

45:17.480 --> 45:19.240
What the fuck is this shit?

45:19.240 --> 45:20.960
Like it's so stupid.

45:20.960 --> 45:22.080
So I was going to ask you,

45:22.080 --> 45:23.640
and you're already kind of answering this,

45:23.640 --> 45:26.160
cause I was going to ask you, where did this game go wrong?

45:26.160 --> 45:27.720
What was the misstep they made along the way?

45:27.720 --> 45:32.760
And it really sounds like you're kind of saying is that this whole idea to make like the,

45:32.760 --> 45:38.520
the, the tone of the game different is just like, it's just, it's, it's wrong from the start.

45:38.520 --> 45:39.520
It's what it is.

45:39.520 --> 45:46.440
What it is is that they're just trying to inject like modern day, like kind of scenarios, I guess,

45:46.440 --> 45:52.080
into it sort of like where it's like, okay, hey, capitalism is bad and we're in a recession.

45:52.080 --> 45:57.000
Oh, I was gonna say, I was gonna say modern day DLC techniques is what they're injecting into it.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.120
Oh, oh, oh no, hold on.

45:59.120 --> 46:00.120
Hold on.

46:00.120 --> 46:01.120
Yeah.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.120
Yes.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.120
There is some bullshit.

46:03.120 --> 46:04.120
Okay.

46:04.120 --> 46:08.320
So there's, there's some jokes that they try to pull off in this game.

46:08.320 --> 46:12.200
Jokes that are just like, take a look in the mirror.

46:12.200 --> 46:13.200
You fucking idiot.

46:13.200 --> 46:19.320
It's like, seriously, they have a joke about like DLC that, Oh, Hey, Oh yeah.

46:19.320 --> 46:22.440
That piece of armor is going to cost two 99.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.120
They're like, ha ha ha funny.

46:24.120 --> 46:26.440
Cause DLC is like a thing.

46:26.440 --> 46:28.640
Have you looked at your previous games?

46:28.640 --> 46:31.200
They were so fucking ridden with DLC.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.360
It was ridiculous.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.920
Like all of the Cosmex were nickel and dive.

46:34.920 --> 46:38.840
Go on steam right now and go buy their fucking game and see how much fucking DLC there was

46:38.840 --> 46:39.840
for it.

46:39.840 --> 46:44.740
It is so goddamn stupid that they would even try to, why even try to poke fun at that?

46:44.740 --> 46:48.200
And then on top of all that, then they make the fucking joke of like the Todd Howard,

46:48.200 --> 46:49.600
it just works bullshit.

46:49.600 --> 46:50.600
Yeah.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.440
Like you should fucking talk with your bug free fucking game.

46:53.440 --> 46:57.200
Like God forbid, but that's at least has a fucking entertaining game after all of those

46:57.200 --> 46:58.200
fucking bugs.

46:58.200 --> 47:02.440
But you, all you have is fucking shitty ass saints were reboot is what you got.

47:02.440 --> 47:04.100
And what's that going to fucking give you?

47:04.100 --> 47:07.960
No one gets a shit about your game and all your fucking like, Oh, we've heard the feedback

47:07.960 --> 47:08.960
in summer.

47:08.960 --> 47:09.960
You are having problems.

47:09.960 --> 47:10.960
Bullshit.

47:10.960 --> 47:11.960
No.

47:11.960 --> 47:12.960
Some of us are having problems.

47:12.960 --> 47:16.200
Everybody's fucking having problems with your broken ass piece of shit game that we've told

47:16.200 --> 47:21.040
you from the outset is going to be shit because of the, your fucking characters that nobody

47:21.040 --> 47:22.040
liked.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.040
And did you fucking listen?

47:23.040 --> 47:24.040
Cause you didn't fucking listen.

47:24.040 --> 47:26.600
Now you have fucking ugly Sonic running up in this shit.

47:26.600 --> 47:30.280
And then you're wondering why no one wants to fucking watch your goddamn movie.

47:30.280 --> 47:31.280
That's wise.

47:31.280 --> 47:33.000
Cause you didn't fucking listen to those stupid fans.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.960
Who were the people who are going to buy your goddamn game in the first place?

47:35.960 --> 47:37.560
Who are you going to fucking sell this to?

47:37.560 --> 47:39.560
People have never heard of fucking saints row.

47:39.560 --> 47:43.400
You're you're targeting it towards people that are going to buy the franchise.

47:43.400 --> 47:46.420
Like you got to make it appeal to the people that play the old game.

47:46.420 --> 47:48.760
And I get it that it's too fucking sensitive.

47:48.760 --> 47:52.160
Now they have fucking strippers and big dicks fucking running around.

47:52.160 --> 47:53.280
You know what?

47:53.280 --> 47:54.480
It's a fucking game.

47:54.480 --> 47:58.280
And you know, sometimes it's fine to be a little bit offensive about that shit.

47:58.280 --> 48:02.960
Like get over your fucking self with your stupid ass game.

48:02.960 --> 48:03.960
That's it.

48:03.960 --> 48:07.440
I got to try to play a little bit longer and to least give it a chance, but it's awful.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.440
It's really awful.

48:08.440 --> 48:10.440
I don't want to play it anymore.

48:10.440 --> 48:14.840
That fashion police spot said, seriously, that game is a fucking fantastic.

48:14.840 --> 48:18.760
I can't wait to play after the show.

48:18.760 --> 48:19.920
I am not going to play that game.

48:19.920 --> 48:23.260
Like seriously is just, it is so disappointing.

48:23.260 --> 48:26.020
Like I am so fucking disappointed with this shit.

48:26.020 --> 48:28.520
Like so long we wanted a new saints row game.

48:28.520 --> 48:33.040
And this is the fucking shit that they pull out and the fucking nerve of them just to

48:33.040 --> 48:36.960
think that like, let's be honest, their writing has not been good.

48:36.960 --> 48:37.960
Okay.

48:37.960 --> 48:38.960
They killed off Gat in the third game.

48:38.960 --> 48:43.120
They thought that was fucking genius writing of them and then everybody was fucking pissed

48:43.120 --> 48:44.120
off at them.

48:44.120 --> 48:45.240
They were fucking pissed off.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.200
So they, Oh, he didn't die.

48:47.200 --> 48:49.040
He got abducted by aliens.

48:49.040 --> 48:51.520
That was the plan all along bull fucking shit.

48:51.520 --> 48:54.760
It was the plan you fucked up and you had the retcon that shit.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.980
So you know what you fucking need retcon all of this shit.

48:56.980 --> 48:58.680
This game does not fucking exist.

48:58.680 --> 48:59.680
Okay.

48:59.680 --> 49:00.680
That's how it is.

49:00.680 --> 49:04.200
You could have made a whole reboot with the original characters and it would have been

49:04.200 --> 49:09.300
fucking in Canon because that was one of the endings in got out of hell.

49:09.300 --> 49:10.660
You could have made a new game.

49:10.660 --> 49:12.980
You don't ask Jamie Lee Curtis.

49:12.980 --> 49:17.100
You don't have to explain if you just want to go back and do a new sequel.

49:17.620 --> 49:21.380
If you're Jamie Lee Curtis, you don't owe anybody a fucking thing.

49:21.380 --> 49:22.980
You don't owe anyone an explanation.

49:22.980 --> 49:23.980
And you know what?

49:23.980 --> 49:25.640
You will be number one at the box office.

49:25.640 --> 49:30.160
So you can, yeah, you could just pull a fucking final fantasy seven reboot thing.

49:30.160 --> 49:33.380
Like you have the same characters, but different shit can go down.

49:33.380 --> 49:34.580
That's all you have to fucking do.

49:34.580 --> 49:39.460
Like it's not a hard thing to do volition, but you know, because of this, we're never

49:39.460 --> 49:42.460
going to get a fucking Saints Row game again.

49:42.460 --> 49:43.460
That's why you're mad.

49:43.460 --> 49:44.460
This is so bad.

49:44.500 --> 49:47.300
It's a franchise killer because, because they fuck this shit up.

49:47.300 --> 49:49.020
They fuck this shit up so much.

49:49.020 --> 49:53.700
So often, like they tried the spinoff was an agents of mayhem or whatever that bullshit

49:53.700 --> 49:54.700
was.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.760
And then nobody wanted to play it because it wasn't a Saints Row game.

49:56.760 --> 50:01.280
So then they are all, Oh, Hey, here's some, we're going to put Johnny Gad in it now.

50:01.280 --> 50:02.280
Just like this one.

50:02.280 --> 50:04.900
They're like, Oh, it doesn't tie in with the original saints at all, but Oh, but you can

50:04.900 --> 50:07.160
buy a Johnny Gad shirt.

50:07.160 --> 50:08.160
Fuck them.

50:08.160 --> 50:09.360
I'm so sick of their shit.

50:12.360 --> 50:12.860
That's it.

50:12.860 --> 50:13.360
We're done.

50:14.460 --> 50:19.660
But other than that, Loki, how was the play anyway?

50:19.660 --> 50:21.920
Yeah, but fashion police squad is awesome.

50:21.920 --> 50:25.460
It's a great, like quick, like, or not quickly, I guess it's sort of like quake.

50:25.460 --> 50:30.220
It's pretty fast paced and stuff and it's, it's silly and it's got like a, it's got a

50:30.220 --> 50:34.740
lot of humor in it and I really think it's worth the play, but yeah, I say it's row.

50:34.740 --> 50:39.140
If you really are interested in it, just wait for a deep discount and wait for a long time

50:39.140 --> 50:41.900
because it's going to take them a ton of time to patch this stuff.

50:41.940 --> 50:44.660
It'll be free on the Epic game store in a year.

50:44.660 --> 50:48.220
It's, it's so unacceptable in the, in the state that it is right now.

50:48.220 --> 50:51.660
It is just absolutely awful.

50:51.660 --> 50:53.980
Like even people have reviewed it on console and stuff.

50:53.980 --> 50:58.060
They said it's crashed a console like numerous times just trying to play this game.

50:58.060 --> 51:00.100
Like it shouldn't be this bad.

51:00.100 --> 51:04.540
Like technically is just all messed up and they clearly rushed it out.

51:04.540 --> 51:09.100
Uh, bonds, double a six and chat says Loki woke up and chose scorched earth.

51:09.100 --> 51:10.100
Yep.

51:10.180 --> 51:13.620
You know, sometimes, sometimes you're really disappointed in a video game.

51:13.620 --> 51:14.620
All right.

51:14.620 --> 51:16.340
Uh, let's see my gaming week.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.460
I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed to follow that.

51:18.460 --> 51:23.340
Uh, I played more Final Fantasy 14, which got a new patch this week, uh, which, uh,

51:23.340 --> 51:24.340
extended the story.

51:24.340 --> 51:27.060
They've got a really cool new character in it and I'm really interested to see where

51:27.060 --> 51:28.060
they go with it.

51:28.060 --> 51:29.220
I really liked the new dungeon.

51:29.220 --> 51:34.100
I really, really liked the Final Fantasy four references because I'll just say it at this

51:34.100 --> 51:35.100
point.

51:35.100 --> 51:37.900
If you're a Final Fantasy 14 fan, you've already played it at this point.

51:37.900 --> 51:42.540
Um, it is now obvious we are fighting the four fiends, uh, in this con because we have

51:42.540 --> 51:44.740
now fought in this, uh, patch.

51:44.740 --> 51:48.980
You fight two of them, uh, you fight Scarmiglione and you fight, uh, Barbariccia.

51:48.980 --> 51:51.940
So, uh, Barbariccia is the trial and it's, it's a good trial.

51:51.940 --> 51:56.340
So, uh, and the Scarmiglione is the dungeon boss and, uh, it's all done very well.

51:56.340 --> 52:02.220
So I can't wait for us to do, uh, Cogzano and, um, Rubicant, uh, Rubicant I'm sure will

52:02.220 --> 52:05.860
be the last one that they do because, you know, that's a, that's a huge, uh, uh, boss

52:05.860 --> 52:06.860
fight.

52:06.860 --> 52:08.340
I love that they're kind of like tying it.

52:08.340 --> 52:12.660
It's not directly Final Fantasy four, but it's like, I feel like it's like an alternate

52:12.660 --> 52:13.980
universe type of thing.

52:13.980 --> 52:15.900
Uh, and the story is great.

52:15.900 --> 52:20.240
And this patch gave us the Island Sanctuary expansion.

52:20.240 --> 52:23.060
So now they're, and they're calling it animal crossing mode.

52:23.060 --> 52:27.100
Mm, I wouldn't go to, I think they want to label anything that's like a farm sim animal

52:27.100 --> 52:28.100
crossing.

52:28.100 --> 52:32.700
I wouldn't call it that, but it is a nice relaxing little like gather and have critters

52:32.700 --> 52:34.500
and veg and plants.

52:34.500 --> 52:40.340
And since it's, and they built it kind of smart so that you can't just hammer it all

52:40.340 --> 52:41.620
out in a night.

52:41.620 --> 52:42.620
People tried.

52:42.620 --> 52:48.820
I mean, I guess you can, if you're really, really dedicated, but I think the developers

52:48.820 --> 52:50.140
are trying to make it very clear.

52:50.140 --> 52:51.140
There's no need to be.

52:51.140 --> 52:54.340
Um, so, uh, yeah, I, I like what they've done with the Island Sanctuary.

52:54.340 --> 52:59.660
I think it's a pretty cool little feature, um, other games I've played this week.

52:59.660 --> 53:06.780
I played, um, Diablo three this weekend, a lot, a lot, um, what's that you and Alan

53:06.780 --> 53:07.780
playing together?

53:07.780 --> 53:08.780
Yep.

53:08.780 --> 53:11.180
Alan, I've been playing, I, I helped power level him.

53:11.180 --> 53:18.100
So uh, yeah, we've been playing, uh, I, uh, I'm up to about Paragon 150 now.

53:18.100 --> 53:21.140
So and that's the season started on Friday.

53:21.140 --> 53:22.260
So I've been playing a lot.

53:22.260 --> 53:28.740
I tried to play Pokemon go yesterday because, uh, yesterday was the big finale of Pokemon

53:28.740 --> 53:31.220
go Fest and I was all jazzed to do it.

53:31.220 --> 53:34.860
I went downtown and I started what, but it was too hot.

53:34.860 --> 53:36.820
It was too hot.

53:36.820 --> 53:40.020
And it's not the degree, like it was a hundred degree day.

53:40.020 --> 53:45.060
We've had worse, but it's just the sun bearing down on you while you're trying to walk around

53:45.060 --> 53:47.820
and find groups to raid with and stuff was just too much.

53:47.820 --> 53:54.180
I didn't realize you could get these new, uh, wild beasts, what the hell are they called?

53:54.180 --> 53:56.660
The wormhole, ultra beasts, whatever they are.

53:56.660 --> 53:57.660
Sorry.

53:57.660 --> 53:58.660
I forget all the names.

53:58.660 --> 54:01.660
I did not realize you could get them through quests.

54:01.660 --> 54:02.660
Thank you.

54:02.660 --> 54:03.660
Ultra beasts.

54:03.660 --> 54:04.780
I thought you had to raid for them.

54:04.780 --> 54:08.000
And I was getting really irritated when I was joining raids and like, no one else is

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
in the area doing it.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.940
I'm like, Oh my God, I'm going to be stuck out here.

54:11.940 --> 54:13.820
But then I found out, Oh, you get them.

54:13.820 --> 54:14.820
Thanks to S.J.

54:14.820 --> 54:15.820
100 Matt sending me a tweet.

54:15.820 --> 54:17.240
He's like, Oh no, you'll get them through the quests.

54:17.240 --> 54:18.240
Don't stress about it.

54:18.240 --> 54:21.340
I was like, Oh, Oh, okay.

54:21.340 --> 54:24.220
Well I guess I could have done this whole thing in my car or I could have gone to the

54:24.220 --> 54:26.660
mall that's indoors.

54:26.660 --> 54:30.680
But at that point I was like, eh, I want to just play Diablo.

54:30.680 --> 54:35.680
So I got three shinies, three, but I got the unknown I needed that I didn't have yet.

54:35.680 --> 54:37.820
I think X and P were the new letters for me.

54:37.820 --> 54:40.460
And I got those and I was happy with that to be honest.

54:40.460 --> 54:42.340
So that's fine.

54:42.340 --> 54:43.780
I had a, I had an okay day.

54:43.780 --> 54:46.540
I got a shiny carob blast.

54:46.540 --> 54:47.700
Is that the name?

54:47.700 --> 54:51.980
It's instead of a dark blue, it's like an Aqua color, which I really like.

54:51.980 --> 54:54.080
And I got the shiny costume Pikachu.

54:54.080 --> 54:57.320
And those are usually pretty rare because they're only available for like a day or two.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.460
So that was, that was cool.

54:59.460 --> 55:04.160
So that was pretty much my gaming week.

55:04.160 --> 55:06.220
That's that's, that's really, that's really it.

55:06.220 --> 55:09.020
There was some other stuff too, but yeah, I'll, I'll talk about it another time.

55:09.020 --> 55:15.500
So why don't we get into housekeeping real quick?

55:15.500 --> 55:16.780
No show next week.

55:16.780 --> 55:17.780
I'm not here.

55:17.780 --> 55:18.780
I'm going to be at Dragon Con.

55:18.780 --> 55:19.780
I've said that a million times.

55:19.780 --> 55:21.220
I'm not going to go over my schedule again.

55:21.220 --> 55:25.300
You can check out last week's show or look for me in the app, Rob Roberts.

55:25.300 --> 55:29.860
I have three panels on video gaming, two on digital media, one on the horror tracks.

55:29.860 --> 55:31.660
I have six panels in all this year.

55:31.660 --> 55:35.120
And if you're going to be in the area, I'd love to meet people that listen to the show.

55:35.120 --> 55:38.960
I've had people come up to me after a panel and say, I've been listening for years and

55:38.960 --> 55:40.060
I just wanted to say hi.

55:40.060 --> 55:43.100
And that that's such a compliment and I really appreciate it.

55:43.100 --> 55:48.780
So please, yeah, if you're going to be at Dragon Con, please don't hesitate to say hi.

55:48.780 --> 55:51.500
And yeah, that's, that's everything I can think of at the moment.

55:51.500 --> 55:54.020
So we won't be here live, but we'll be back in two weeks.

55:54.020 --> 55:57.740
But I hope everybody has a fabulous Labor Day, uh, with whatever it is you're going

55:57.740 --> 55:58.740
to be doing this weekend.

55:58.740 --> 56:02.560
There's a lot of conventions going on here, here locally, SacAnime is always a thing that

56:02.560 --> 56:03.560
weekend.

56:03.560 --> 56:06.020
Um, what else is Labor Day weekend?

56:06.020 --> 56:13.140
There's another big convention I'm, is PAX, PAX, hello, PAX West is this weekend, right?

56:13.140 --> 56:16.860
So that's, that's the other big thing I was like, what is the other big thing on Labor

56:16.860 --> 56:18.980
Day that I always, oh yeah, it's PAX.

56:18.980 --> 56:20.400
So that's happening.

56:20.400 --> 56:21.820
So that'll be fun too.

56:21.820 --> 56:24.260
All right, uh, let's move on.

56:24.260 --> 56:27.180
Let's get into some gaming news and talk about some other video games stuff that's been going

56:27.180 --> 56:28.740
on around the globe.

56:28.740 --> 56:30.380
Loki, we'll start with you.

56:30.380 --> 56:34.980
Our Discord's been chatting about this one over at vog network.com slash Discord.

56:34.980 --> 56:37.740
Our Orange House Radio chat has been going off on this.

56:37.740 --> 56:39.800
So much shocking turn of events.

56:39.800 --> 56:45.660
Sony has decided to raise the price of the PlayStation 5, taking a, taking a page out

56:45.660 --> 56:47.820
of the meta book there.

56:47.820 --> 56:54.080
Um, they have said that challenging economic conditions, um, have cost the component prices

56:54.080 --> 56:55.080
that go up.

56:55.080 --> 57:00.060
And so in sense, they're going to raise the price in most markets.

57:00.060 --> 57:03.660
The U S seems to be the only exception at the moment.

57:03.660 --> 57:09.740
Um, but right now, like for example, uh, the PlayStation 5 or the PlayStation 5 with disk

57:09.740 --> 57:16.460
drive in Lake Europe is going to be, uh, five 49 99 and the digital edition being four

57:16.460 --> 57:18.500
49 99.

57:18.500 --> 57:23.420
Um, in the EU, it's going up from 500 to five 50.

57:23.420 --> 57:34.140
Um, we have in Australia now seven 50 to 800 and even in Mexico, uh, going from, uh, looks

57:34.140 --> 57:45.740
like 14,999 or eight with the, uh, Blu-ray drive and 12,499, uh, for the digital edition.

57:45.740 --> 57:49.900
Mike, Mike Deft, who is in Mexico had a few things to say about this on Discord and it

57:49.900 --> 57:53.220
has a few more things to say in our chat right now.

57:53.220 --> 57:55.300
So it's not happy about it.

57:55.300 --> 58:01.380
And that means just to stress, uh, it is not going up in the U S this is pretty much all

58:01.380 --> 58:03.260
these other places, but not the U S.

58:03.260 --> 58:04.660
So interesting.

58:04.660 --> 58:06.780
It is interesting that they're doing that.

58:06.780 --> 58:13.500
Um, now Microsoft and Nintendo have said that they're not planning on, um, Raising prices

58:13.500 --> 58:14.820
at this time.

58:14.820 --> 58:19.140
So Microsoft came out and said, we're constantly evaluating our business to offer our fans

58:19.140 --> 58:21.880
great gaming options are okay.

58:21.880 --> 58:25.540
So basically they said that I don't want to read all the PR speak, but it's basically

58:25.540 --> 58:28.380
saying that the prices are going to stay the same.

58:28.380 --> 58:35.740
Um, and then for Nintendo, they're saying they're not considering a switch price increase.

58:35.740 --> 58:36.860
That's probably for the best.

58:36.860 --> 58:37.860
Yeah.

58:37.860 --> 58:39.860
I mean, it's fine.

58:39.860 --> 58:46.500
Like, I, I'm surprised that they're doing that, like, cause I don't think that they're

58:46.500 --> 58:50.940
selling a ton of consoles in the mile of money that they, they don't make any thought of

58:50.940 --> 58:54.580
those consoles anyways, but I don't think they're losing a ton either.

58:54.580 --> 58:58.340
I don't know, but we'll see how that works out for them.

58:58.340 --> 59:01.980
I guess they're thinking right now because the shortages, it's still going to be in high

59:01.980 --> 59:06.220
demand, but it's like, you know, hopefully they're not thinking, well, scalpers could

59:06.220 --> 59:07.220
get that kind of money.

59:07.220 --> 59:11.300
So let's see if we can get that kind of money.

59:11.300 --> 59:14.300
It's just going to make the scalpers bring it up even higher.

59:14.300 --> 59:15.300
Yeah.

59:15.300 --> 59:19.420
I, it doesn't that feel a little bit like what Disneyland's doing.

59:19.420 --> 59:24.140
Let's raise the price so high that only the really rich people come and we don't have

59:24.140 --> 59:26.100
pass holders anymore.

59:26.100 --> 59:31.500
Like I, I, it just feels a little bit like that to me in a way, but you got it.

59:31.500 --> 59:34.900
You got to cater to your whales is what you're probably thinking.

59:34.900 --> 59:35.900
I guess so.

59:35.900 --> 59:41.100
Well, I, uh, I shudder to see what this little device is going to cost, but we know that

59:41.100 --> 59:45.900
the PlayStation VR two is apparently going to launch in early 2023.

59:45.900 --> 59:47.940
Uh, that is all we got.

59:47.940 --> 59:53.820
And I think this came from a tweet, uh, that like, uh, PlayStation France or something

59:53.820 --> 59:55.220
kind of first put out there.

59:55.220 --> 59:59.060
Uh, we don't know, like anything else, we don't know price, we don't know the actual

59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.060
date or whatever.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:04.820
I would assume that they're going to get it out before the fiscal year is over.

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:08.980
Cause usually when something is early 2023, especially a piece of hardware, that's what

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:09.980
they're aiming for.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:15.540
Um, this would not be completely unhinged for new hardware to come out in the beginning

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.540
of the year.

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:21.660
Um, Nintendo changed that game when they released the switch, uh, in March, right.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:26.460
And, uh, showed that you don't have to release a new console, uh, around the holidays, technically

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:32.480
the PS VR two is not a new console, but it might as well be, uh, you know, it's a, certainly

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:39.060
a high cost expansion for an existing console, but, uh, I love original PlayStation VR for

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.060
the PS four.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:44.460
Uh, so I'm totally all about, you know, if the right games are out, I will totally get

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:47.020
a VR two for the PlayStation five.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:51.180
I don't know what game is the must have app for this right now.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:54.060
I'm sure they're going to port Beat Saber.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.060
No man's sky.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:56.060
We already know is getting ported.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.220
I'm well, actually would they port Beat Saber now?

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.880
Cause didn't meta pick up the studio that has that.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.880
So maybe, I don't know.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:07.140
I think they'd be fools not to, but I guess that's maybe not such a sure thing.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:15.200
So I'll be very curious to see what must have games come out, but I guess that horizon spin-off

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200
looked kind of neat.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.380
I guess, I guess Sony's trying to do their own things in house.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.380
We'll see.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:28.020
So, uh, more to come on that, uh, Bobby Black Wolf clarifying in chat, meta said they would

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:34.580
keep Beat Saber multi-platform well, you know, I don't doubt that, but I doubted a little

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:40.940
bit from them because, you know, Microsoft kind of also has played the wishy-washy we're

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:46.300
going to keep things multi-platform, but then, but not everything, you know, so they can

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:50.580
always, my point is they can always go back on their word and there's really nothing that

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:54.900
anybody can do about it, but I do think it's in their best interest to keep a multi-platform.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:02.340
Um, also meta sucks, but it sucks just a little bit less thanks to the changes they made where

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.820
you finally don't have to have a Facebook account linked to your, uh, meta thing anymore.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:08.380
So that's kind of nice, I guess.

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.380
Yeah.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:14.540
All right, let's move on a completely different topic, uh, Dark Sakura.

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:20.700
So, um, yeah, I brought up some Resident Evil stuff earlier, but what I did not bring up

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:26.260
was Resident Evil on Netflix, which honestly I had completely forgotten existed.

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:31.940
Um, and apparently a lot of other people forgot it existed or didn't really care for it, um,

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:34.420
because it's being canceled.

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:40.060
From what I understand, most people that remembered it existed wishes, wishes they hadn't.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.140
Hmm.

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:50.340
Well, um, it is, uh, there's not going to be a season two, even though there were thoughts

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:56.700
that there could be something better that came from it, um, but at any rate, um, it's

01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.580
not getting a second season.

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.780
The story wasn't very well suited.

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.580
It didn't really follow very well.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:10.820
Um, it had some weird narrative framing for jumping between timelines.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:16.620
Um, yeah, they're, they're just, it's no.

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:20.060
I mean, the actors in it were apparently really great.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:26.420
Um, but it just suffered from really bad writing and a convoluted plot.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:32.540
And let's, let's also not forget Netflix has a reputation of sorts for, um, renewing shows

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:37.340
or not as the case may be to which a DJ on my S in chat is saying, bring back cowboy

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:41.220
bebop, which of course, you know, that was another high profile cancellation after the

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:45.580
first season that folks didn't, but I feel like more people liked that show than liked,

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:46.580
uh, resident evil.

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:51.940
I saw maybe one person that said something borderline positive about it.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:52.940
I didn't see it.

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:55.740
So I've, I have no horse in the race.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.940
I was looking at the dude playing, uh, I guess it's supposed to be Chris.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:01.700
He looks kind of like bad cosplay.

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.700
He's cute though.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.700
That's it.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.700
All right.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.740
Well, here's the thing though.

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.020
They don't just remove it from the service.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.180
That's HBO max.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:14.640
So if you could still go back and watch the first season, if you are feeling some sort

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.640
of way, enjoy.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.640
All right.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.620
I was looking to see what else they canceled.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:26.820
They canceled another life, archive 81, cooking with Paris, which honestly, uh, yeah, no cooking

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:27.820
with Paris.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.820
Q force.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.900
Q force.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.540
Why did I not know about that?

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.940
Well, oh, they canceled that.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.460
I heard it was actually funny.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.460
Yeah.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.660
It was all right.

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:40.060
It also canceled raising Dion, the babysitter's club.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.620
Oh, now see raising Dion, I'm kind of disappointed.

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.820
That actually was a decent series.

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:51.300
And the midnight gospel, um, fill a nine and chat says HBO max is kind of a mess right

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.300
now.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:57.820
Girl, don't get us started.

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.260
Like H HBO max.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.300
So bold.

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.380
They tried to cancel Sesame street.

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.380
Okay.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:10.060
That's, that's the kind of pure, pure fuckery that's going on at HBO max right now.

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.220
Now, look, I understand it.

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.180
PBS owns Sesame street at the end of the day.

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.940
It's a complicated arrangement.

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:24.420
The whole, the whole fact that Sesame street would even be up for debate is sick in my

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.420
opinion.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:31.700
But anyway, HBO max, she's a disaster.

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.900
She is a hot mess.

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:34.900
Anyway.

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.900
Yeah.

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:39.520
Bobby buckle says they did remove early versions of Sesame street.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.820
They are just deleting stuff from the service.

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:42.820
That's the thing about Netflix.

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:45.420
They'll cancel everything, but they'll still try to say, Oh, you should go back and watch

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:46.420
resident evil.

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.520
Just, you know, to inflate the ratings and spend the hours on the service.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.520
They don't just remember things.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.520
For some reason.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.520
Oh, for the record.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.360
Um, I might've mentioned this before, but like there had been some episode of Sesame

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.080
street that had never been aired again.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.880
Now it's on, uh, YouTube.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:02.880
Which one is that?

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.320
Uh, I, we were watching it the other day.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:11.900
I'll, I'll look it up and then I, the only one I've ever pulled up and watched on YouTube

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.040
was the one where Mr. Hooper passed away.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:18.340
Um, which actually like in retrospect, you know, I remember seeing that as a kid, I think

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.120
a lot of folks around our age kind of remember that from being younger.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.080
I think it was the one with Margaret Hamilton.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:27.560
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, interesting.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.080
It was, yeah.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:38.640
So it's the one, um, from 1976 and they found the episode and then someone put it up on,

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.800
uh, on YouTube.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.640
Margaret Hamilton, the, uh, Wicked Witch of the West from the original, uh, yeah, she

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.840
was also on Mr. Rogers because that, that clip is around YouTube as well.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:52.080
That one was great how she just puts on the outfit there to prove that she wasn't, you

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.080
know, scary.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.080
Yeah.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.080
Interesting.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.080
All right.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.920
Anyway, I was going to say, um, but the Mr. Hooper thing, like in retrospect is so well

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.920
done.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.820
Like you don't like really, I think, appreciate it until you're older, like how they handled

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:09.600
such a sensitive subject with tact and dignity.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.080
So, um, yeah, I, I, I remember it.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.840
I still get verklempt watching it.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.480
It's really, um, yeah, anyway.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:21.760
Not to bring the show down, but you know, that, that is what HBO max is deleting.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.040
Let's just put out, let's just, let's just put it out there.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.040
All right.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.880
And by the way, I linked the episode for people in chat.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:33.820
It is Sesame street episode 847 from 1976.

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:39.080
And then after you watch that, go and listen to the, the 12 song with the pinball theme

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.800
because that, um, was an awesome, so watch any of that until tomorrow.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800
Okay.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800
Yeah.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.800
Right now.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.800
Right now you focus on us.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.800
Okay.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:53.720
Uh, moving on, uh, Loki, sorry, I've got like earthquake going on here.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.840
This I need to tighten the screws on this desk and we're just going to just fall apart

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.840
one day.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.480
Cause it shakes so easy every time there's no, well, that would be me.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.480
All right.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.480
Uh, moving on.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.480
Loki, what do you have?

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.480
All right.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:12.320
So here comes to nouveau putting its stupid head where it doesn't need to be.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:20.840
Um, so Geneva was come out saying that, you know, Hey, Hey people, we need some more business.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.920
So they're going to solve a problem that nobody has.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:29.920
And that is with folks, um, emulating switch games on PC.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.480
They're going to try to break it somehow.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:42.140
I imagine that that will go as well as it's gone with their PC security, meaning it's

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:48.660
not going to make a difference and it's going to end up hurting the actual consumer more,

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.260
which tends to be the case.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:54.940
So they are saying though, even if a game is protected against piracy on its PC version,

01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:58.980
uh, it says the release version of the switch can be emulated from day one and played on

01:08:58.980 --> 01:08:59.980
PC.

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:05.180
Therefore bypassing the strong protection, um, or strong protections offered on the PC

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:10.160
version, the Nintendo switch emulation protection will ensure that anyone wishing to play the

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.600
game has to buy a legitimate copy.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600
You're right.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.580
Like, cause no one's ever bypassed you or security.

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:23.380
You're just impossible to beat like, and also like, even with like stuff like that, companies

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.880
have done that in the past.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:29.920
Like you're not the first, they did this like even on like the 3DS and on like even older

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:34.960
games on other platforms where if you have a pirated version, it just doesn't work the

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.960
same way.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.960
Like there's things that are broken with it.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.360
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.240
This whole thing strikes me as a challenge.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.920
Like Danuvo is just like, fight us and the entire internet's like, okay, they will lose.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920
I'm sorry.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.760
Like they will end up losing Mike.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.960
Mike Defton chat says Danuvo on switch.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.960
Yeah.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.760
Now more games will run even worse on switch.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.760
Yeah.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.280
I'm suddenly reminded of like how well optimized and I say that tongue firmly planted in cheek,

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:05.200
how well optimized cooking mama on the switch was where people were playing that game going,

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.600
is this bitch mining Bitcoin on my switch?

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.440
Why is this game running like such garbage?

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.320
And that's what we have to look forward to.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.800
Yeah, I haven't weren't they in a switch game already or something like wasn't there some

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.800
sort of DRA?

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.800
I don't know.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:26.560
But anyways, they're saying that they're going to, you know, try to it just seems like marketing

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.400
speak but like it's never worked.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:34.200
I think from what I remember, like, what would it Okay, let's just hypothetically let's just

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:43.560
pretend for a second there that the concern was people, you know, emulating these games.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:48.880
Most of the time emulation happens after a game comes out like a while after the game

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880
comes out.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880
Right.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:56.840
So like, if I can't emulate a day one, I don't think that's necessarily going to cause more

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.680
sales to happen.

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:03.300
It's just like if people are hell bent on emulating the game, they're not going to buy

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.660
the game and all you're doing is hurting the consumer.

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:09.740
A lot of pirates just keep an active stockpile of games they never intended to purchase in

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:11.700
the first place, which I'm not saying makes it right.

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.140
And I don't want to make it sound like I'm advocating for piracy.

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:20.000
Like I understand that it can be very frustrating to see that people are playing switch releases

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.620
on day one that they didn't pay for.

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:23.620
Like I get that.

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:28.060
Yeah, the thing the thing and I understand that the video game industry has a vested

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:29.260
interest in protecting that.

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:33.740
So again, I'm not defending the act of pirating modern day games.

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:38.500
Now when it comes to emulating the Super Nintendo and the NES, I say we're in a completely different

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:44.420
realm that has to do a game preservation licensing and all that bullshit fuckery that happens.

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:50.100
That means we don't have classic fucking games like the Guardian Legend available to play

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:51.580
on modern consoles.

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:55.140
We have to emulate that and we need to be able to do that.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:58.140
However, here's here's the thing, sorry, Loki, before I let's finish.

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:02.460
Here's the thing with this is that I think where we take issue with this is that Denuvo

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:06.620
is coming in going, don't worry, I'll fix it.

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.500
And it's like, shut up.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:15.500
Nobody asked you like, here's, did you consider maybe just doing your thing quietly and not

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.460
having to advertise?

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:22.780
Because what you're doing with this is you are literally inviting the entire dark side

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.860
of the internet and the people you don't want to be doing this in the first, you are just

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.980
inviting them to fight.

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:33.900
You have, Denuvo has literally sent an email to all of the hackers and crackers in the

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:39.020
entire galaxy going bike racks, 3pm, see you there.

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:44.740
And now they're going to create a problem that I would argue didn't, it's that whole

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:49.420
blowing something out of proportion because yes, is piracy happening on the Switch?

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.420
Yes.

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:53.340
Is piracy only going to get worse because of this announcement?

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.340
Yes.

01:12:54.820 --> 01:13:00.080
Does Nintendo think it's a problem that's, you know, warrants another company solving

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.080
it for them?

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:06.740
No, because Nintendo is not even involved in this initiative that Denuvo is taking themselves

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:09.340
upon to try to solve.

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.780
So like, who is going to utilize this?

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:18.220
A third party company is like, a third party publisher is going to do that, like, then

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:23.280
once people catch wind that that game has Denuvo, you know what that does on PC games?

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.160
Most people try to avoid that shit.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.960
So like, it's like, Denuvo is up on their soapbox making a proclamation and Nintendo

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:37.360
is down in front going, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.320
It's just, it's dumb.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.320
So dumb.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.840
SSJ 100 Matt brings up an excellent point.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.080
Piracy has become a necessary evil in the fight for game preservation.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.880
There are so many games disappearing forever on the 3DS store soon.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880
Fact!

01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:01.680
That is well stated by SSJ 100 Matt and an excellent example of, somebody's going to

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.040
wildly take me out of context.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.340
Don't do it, but I'm going to say it.

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:07.880
Why we need piracy.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:16.880
Yeah, and on top of this too, like, okay, so yeah, this does also like, you know, allegedly

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:22.720
could probably won't because their cop protection sucks, but could prohibit, you know, the backing

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:28.920
up of these games later on for archival purpose, um, Denuvo claims that these checks that they

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:33.480
would implement would be offline checks being meaning that the keys are going to be hidden

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.580
within the games.

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:43.080
How this is never going to not be like cracked immediately is beyond me how they think that

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.800
this is going to ever work.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:53.200
It's not ever going to work, but I mean, sure, sure Denuvo.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:57.300
Phila9 with a really good question, I'm not actually sure the answer to in our chat asking

01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:00.200
are these games captured at the Library of Congress?

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.680
I know they archive a lot of games.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.160
I think it would be impossible to archive everything.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.640
There's so many Indian self published things out there.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:13.400
I'm not sure they all get captured in an official governmental capacity.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:18.600
However, we have certainly heard of efforts, like for example, what we just had recently

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:24.360
Embracer group, right, has that big, you know, museum physical place that they're building

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:30.760
to try to preserve games like video game preservation is becoming more and more of a thing you see

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.720
out there like, you know, just enthusiasts.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:37.520
And you kind of joke about your librarian brain.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:42.000
But I would argue others with librarian brains out there who also love video games are kind

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.360
of trying to solve because I'm not sure there's like a government thing in there.

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.840
Oh, and Bobby Blackwell puts an excellent point there.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.560
The games industry fights against libraries archiving their stuff.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.560
That's right.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.440
I remember this thing about this here, because if there is remotely a chance that someone

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:58.920
could play the game for fun because of the library archive, that's a problem.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:04.320
I remember that was a story a couple years ago, towards the beginning of the pandemic.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.320
You're right.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.360
Somebody was trying to fight against that whole preservation thing because heaven forbid,

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.640
somebody is, you know, pirating a game that's no longer for sale.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.080
It's just interesting.

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:21.120
So but I think I think, again, once something is on the Internet, you're not going to get

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.180
it off the Internet.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:28.400
And so you see other ways of archiving things that are out there, such as archive.org, right?

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.380
The Internet archive is a big thing.

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.020
But of course, they're getting sued over it.

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:36.440
So yeah.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.800
But as Joe and Matt says, listen, I would pay for a service to play all of these old

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.800
games.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.800
Anyone would.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.800
Well, I shouldn't say anyone would.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.360
And I don't want to make it sound like I'm belittling your comment because I'm not.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.980
But I think what it really comes down to is these legal issues that hold games back from

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.240
being able to.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:00.980
This is the part that bites the game industry in the fucking ass when it comes to this stuff.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:05.120
Like again, I'm going to use Guardian Legend as my example, because you know the love I

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.260
have for that game.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:10.200
The Dark Sakura has to that game that Loki, I'm going to just say, has love for that game,

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.420
whether he does or not.

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:14.480
We have a big love for the Guardian Legend here at Orange Mountains Radio.

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.160
And you again cannot play that game through legal purposes right now because it is caught

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.520
up in licensing fuckery right now.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.880
And that is doing the games industry a disservice.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:28.120
If they were to put out the Guardian Legend for 10 bucks on the Nintendo Switch, I would

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.120
buy it tomorrow.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.280
I bet Dark Sakura would be tempted to pick it up as well.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.260
I think there'd be a lot of people who would pick it up.

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:34.260
But it doesn't happen.

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.260
Why?

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:36.260
Because of these issues.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:44.440
And the business side of video games ruins video games way too often in this industry.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.440
And it sucks.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:54.140
Anyway, Savalusan Chat, hi, says, we need a video game vault just like the seed vault

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:55.140
in Norway.

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:59.640
Well, ironically, that whole Embracer group thing I'm talking about is what they're trying

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.120
to basically build.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.360
So there is that.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:08.500
Bobby Black Wolf with an interesting perspective too saying Super Mario Brothers will enter

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.640
the public domain in 2060.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.940
It'll be very interesting to see what happens in the future as you know, because I didn't

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:24.360
they refuse to extend the Disney law any further like Mickey Mouse, circa Steamboat Willie

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.820
is going into the public domain if he hasn't already, right?

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:32.460
Like Disney ran out of time finally, and they couldn't convince Congress to buy more.

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:34.220
So it's going to be interesting.

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:39.320
So anyway, all right, let's move on.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:46.960
Let's talk about Steam, the mobile app version, which it hasn't been updated in a long time,

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.760
but it's going to be getting updated, which is great because I kind of think the mobile

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.160
app they have now is a little bit clunky and aged.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.960
So they're going to be updating the app, of course, Android and iOS we're talking about.

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:03.760
And they're going to be, I guess they've already invited invested users to beta test this app.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:11.060
Using a redesigned client, they've built it on a new framework, they've modernized design.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:16.300
So you can do more intelligent notifications, multi account support, that's nice.

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:19.140
And this is great, a new way to get into your account.

01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:22.820
So you don't have to worry about the username, the password, the Steam guard, you just use

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:26.740
a QR code like you do on Discord or Signal or something like that.

01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:30.020
That is going to be the most time saving new feature that they're putting into that, which

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.300
is cool.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:34.280
Apparently the beta is still running a little bit sluggish right now, but they're hoping

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.800
to get that working before it comes out.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:43.920
So iOS does have a beta, that beta is limited to 10,000 users right now because of the restrictions

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.640
of test flight.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:50.200
But you can check that out on the Steam website if you're curious to get into it, steamcommunity.com

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.520
slash groups slash Steam mobile app.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.280
I'll wait for the full release, but I think this is an exciting thing that's coming.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:00.720
The Steam mobile app badly needed something like this, especially when it comes to Steam

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:01.740
Guard.

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.460
So I think that's cool.

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.620
Going to chat, they're talking about public domain things.

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:12.700
Bobby Black Wolf and DJ Rama S are pointing out Winnie the Pooh is in public domain now,

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.260
hence the horror movie.

01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:20.020
Yes, I actually, I know the people there through a weird like three degrees of separation type

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.580
of thing.

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:26.100
And so that's, yeah, that's a great point is that's the type of stuff.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:32.660
But if I remember right, it's only Winnie the Pooh and not Christopher Robin the way

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.920
he's portrayed in the Disney movies.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.240
Like it's very interesting what they can and can't do.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.200
So we'll see more and more and more stuff like that to come in the future.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.680
I wonder if that's why we see all this Pinocchio stuff now too.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.800
But that was, that was based on a book that wasn't like an original Disney thing, right?

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.480
So that book has to be public domain at this point.

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:55.860
All right.

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.900
Anyway, let's move on.

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:03.340
Um, an update on an incredibly frustrating story, Dark Sakura.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:11.620
So and I've actually been following her now for a little bit.

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:22.900
So we were following the story of Kethals, Clara Sorrenti, who had been doxxed and, and

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:27.640
I've got a little bit more on this than just what the article says too, has had to leave

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:38.960
Canada because of harassment and is living in an undisclosed location in Europe.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.220
And there's a lot, there's a lot more.

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:47.960
So I'll go ahead and read what, what she said, as a Twitch broadcaster, my livelihood relies

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:52.880
on the connections I form with my audience and is harder than it would be in any other

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:57.500
profession to keep my location hidden, hidden, I want to keep working and because I know

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:01.360
I have this huge target on my back, I've decided to take refuge in Europe where I have close

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:05.960
friends who are willing to host me, so I can continue to stream while my stalkers continuously

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:11.320
try to hunt me down and send the message I am never safe.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.520
And she also had posted about her Uber account being hacked and like a bunch of food showing

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.560
up that was charged on her account.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:23.680
You would think Uber would have a safeguard on that after you order so many different

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.880
restaurants.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.660
Like I can, I can understand why somebody might order from two or three different restaurants,

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:32.620
you know, depending on what picky eaters or party, but the amount of food she got, like,

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.160
why didn't Uber have a fail safe on that?

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.160
That's really weird to me.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.160
I don't know.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.160
That's beside the point.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:43.260
Well, well, well, I, I would say that, yeah, companies, all companies need to realize there

01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:45.520
are shitty people out there doing shitty things.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:51.320
But anyway, I know it's, it's past the main point, but Uber does need to look into it.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:59.900
Anyway, um, the whole thing has been going because she's had a very big, uh, campaign

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:05.000
now to get this, uh, harassment site Kiwi Farms taken down.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.360
Uh, and the site's been taken down a few times.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:14.320
Um, but, but she's been working really hard and knowing what this site is.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:21.120
Um, there have been many, many, many, uh, outreach has gone to Cloudflare who has been

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:29.280
hosting them and not paying attention to any of, of the demands that have been, you know,

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.280
going on.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:38.600
And these are people who have got done full, uh, uh, harassment, uh, I would almost say

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:50.000
campaigns against other people, um, and have, you know, been a hotbed for racism, antisemitism,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.080
transphobia, homophobia, you name it.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:59.440
If it's not, you know, this gender white male, they've got a problem with it.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:06.560
Um, and also, uh, for supporting, uh, Putin just also adding that in there too.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:15.480
So, um, but thankfully she, uh, hasn't slacked off at all in her advocacy.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.800
There are people making fake accounts.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.960
I found one that was deleted just today.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:27.640
Um, there are, it's, it's just people still spreading misinformation about her.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:31.360
People just, it's disgusting.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.440
It's really disgusting.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.280
And she is keeping her head high and working hard on it.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:44.360
And honestly, I, I, she's doing really amazing work under a really stressful situation.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:49.280
And I think that we need to make sure that we get the word spread to support her and

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.240
support what she's doing.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:57.280
And also make sure that we, you know, go out saying that this type of behavior is not going

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:03.360
to be permitted in our society, will not be tolerated, and that we will stand up against

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.360
it.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360
Yeah.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.040
Um, definitely good for her for hanging in there.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:13.720
Um, I, I don't know how she's doing it cause she's just constantly taking abuse.

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.720
It's sick.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:22.720
They went, they went on her father's, uh, Memorial Facebook and we're taking photos

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.880
that were on that account and captioning them saying that he would be disappointed with

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:31.240
her and that he would hate her and all of this when she was like, no, he was completely

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.640
supportive of me all up until the end.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:35.780
So how can some people sleep at night?

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:37.360
How can some people sleep at night?

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.360
So gross.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.820
There are evil people in the world and they don't care what they do because they have

01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:48.880
anonymity behind them except for, uh, the, the guy who's, I think running the Kiwi farm

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:49.880
site.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:26:00.640
Um, apparently a trans person that, uh, that he had doxed showed up at his house and, uh,

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:06.320
he went and hid in his bedroom and his mother dealt with, dealt with her.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.120
Like the scared little bitch that they were.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:15.200
Oh, and his mother's just as bad as he is apparently, but it's just completely unforgivable

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.520
and they're not human.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:23.160
I'm not a super religious person, but I do firmly believe that for those people, God

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:26.160
or whatever you want to call it, God is going to kick your ass.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.200
That is, I firmly believe it.

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.360
So for the record, that isn't karma.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360
That's not what karma is.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.920
I didn't call it karma.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:33.920
Yeah.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.600
I'm just, I'm telling that for other people.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.280
People like to say that that's karma when that is not what karma is.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.320
Um, it's appropriate to have to use that term.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:53.160
Um, but I do believe that the, you know, it's a physics law, you know, uh, for every action

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:57.680
there is an opposite and equal reaction, right?

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.660
The reaction is going to come.

01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:02.960
It's already coming.

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:09.600
And these people are going, look, already that guy in his site is losing, um, public

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.600
opinion.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:14.960
He put out a statement saying, I've been losing public opinion and men men men men

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:15.960
men.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:16.960
And we're like, okay, cry me a big river.

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.960
You big baby.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.800
Go hide in mommy's closet.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:21.800
Yeah.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:25.480
Like if you want to dish it out, you need to be able to take it too.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:26.480
Yeah.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.960
All right.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:32.540
Let's move on, uh, onto, I would say onto a happier note, although I'm not sure lawsuits

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:35.800
are usually happy stories, but, um, it's the best transition I've got.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.160
So Loki, what's next?

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:39.160
All right.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.200
So, um, let's talk about more lawsuits.

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:51.120
So Sony is being sued for $5.9 billion, uh, allegedly for ripping people off on digital

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.120
games.

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:56.840
And the reason that they're trying to make, or the, the reason that they're suing or the

01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:02.320
argument that they're trying to make is that because Sony charges a 30% commission fee

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.540
and all digital purchases made through the UK PlayStation store.

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:13.320
This is a UK lawsuit, um, that it causes, I guess the games to be higher priced also

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:19.960
because they control their own digital marketplace.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:28.080
Like I mean, all the other companies do, um, that they are anti-competitive.

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.760
And so because of that, since there's no competition, um, it leaves the prices being

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:33.760
high.

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:37.000
I think it's gonna be a hard argument for them to make.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.560
It's gonna be very hard.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.640
It's like, that's like that Epic games, Apple argument that didn't work out well.

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:50.620
So Sony is not doing anything different from what many peers in several industries are

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:51.720
also doing.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:56.520
So I just don't see how this, why PlayStation is getting called out when they're literally

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:59.280
doing the exact same thing, Nintendo and Microsoft specifically.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:03.080
And then if you kind of go further out into other entertainment industries, you know,

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.280
Apple, Google, and you know, the folks on the phones, this is like this 30% is pretty

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.280
much a standard.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.280
Yeah.

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:15.520
And I guess you could say with Microsoft, it might be harder to make that argument because

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:19.240
they have their games on other platforms.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.860
Like they have Microsoft games on steam.

01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:25.860
You can get Microsoft games on the Microsoft game store.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:30.780
Um, so that might be harder to make the argument or they just pick Sony to start, you know,

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:31.780
trying to Sue.

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.560
I don't think they're going to win.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.500
I don't think this, anything's going to come of this, but I don't either.

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:38.980
I think it gets laughed out of court.

01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:39.980
Yeah.

01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:46.660
It's, I mean, they're probably just like, well, if we win even 1%, that's a lot of money.

01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:48.340
I don't think that's going to happen.

01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:49.940
I don't either, but we'll see.

01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:50.940
We'll keep an eye on it.

01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:52.020
All right.

01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.020
Another thing to keep an eye on.

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:54.020
This is a game.

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.020
We don't talk about enough.

01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.460
This game is so cool.

01:29:56.460 --> 01:30:01.140
I really enjoy just some chill with Microsoft flight simulator.

01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:05.220
And we got some news that a games com that a big upgrade for Microsoft flight simulator

01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.180
is incoming on November the 11th.

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:09.920
Originally this was supposed to come on the 22nd.

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.540
And this is the rare story of an expansion getting bumped up as opposed to bump back,

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:16.300
but it's apparently ready to go.

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:18.460
And this is the 40th anniversary edition.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:22.980
Obviously we're celebrating the flight simulator series as a whole.

01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:29.260
And this new expansion will basically be free for those that have Xbox game pass because

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:31.460
the original games on it.

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:36.140
What will be added in this helicopters and gliders you'll be able to, which is the first

01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:38.900
time they've been seen in the series for a while.

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:44.020
Also going to be added to the series an actual like commercial airliner.

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:49.640
They have some in the game, but the very popular Airbus A310 is going to be added to the game.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:53.380
So if you want to fly your own, I guess, Southwest flight, you can do that.

01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:54.800
So that's kind of neat.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:58.440
There's also some more historical aircraft that are getting added to the game.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:05.240
The Spruce Goose, the Spirit of St. Louis, the original flight from May of 1927.

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.500
Those are going in the game.

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:13.180
They're also going to be adding some more airports, glider airports, heliports, and

01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:14.180
so on.

01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:20.580
There's also a new city update that just came out that includes photo improvements

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:26.920
for some locations in Germany, which of course is the home of Gamescom.

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:33.160
So that's why Germany got some cities like Canover, Cologne, and so forth got their cities

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:35.060
reworked a little bit for Gamescom.

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:36.380
So pretty cool.

01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:40.900
Anyway, I definitely recommend flight simulator, especially if you're a game pass person, then

01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:42.820
there's really nothing to pay for it.

01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:48.620
It's a really good use case for cloud as well, because the download is gigantic, but it plays

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:49.620
fine on the cloud.

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:50.620
It's super cute.

01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:54.700
So that's one I definitely recommend checking out.

01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:56.820
All right.

01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:02.800
So flight simulator turns 40, and that's certainly a classic game.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.820
But every week here on the program, we like to highlight another classic game in this

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.500
segment coming up right now.

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:24.420
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:25.780
out a classic and-

01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:26.780
What's the difference between-

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:31.980
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:32.980
Sorry about that.

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:38.500
A dumb ad came up while I was trying to get the B roll up here, but Dark Soccer-

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:39.500
You pay for it.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.500
Yeah.

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:41.500
Dark Soccer, why don't you tell us-

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:42.500
I pay for it.

01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:44.540
I pay for mine.

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:47.220
Let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:49.880
What game did you pick for us this week?

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:56.140
I picked Final Fantasy Tactics, which I haven't done it before, and I pretty much know why.

01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:58.500
I'm not a fan of tactics games.

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:07.180
As much as I love Final Fantasy, and as much as this series is well beloved by many people,

01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:09.380
I don't like tactics games.

01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:16.260
But I'm still going to cover it because I know a lot of people do like tactics games.

01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:21.660
I would also like to just point out that if someone says they don't like something, don't

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:22.660
immediately go,

01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:23.660
Yeah, well, I do.

01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:24.660
Like it's a personal challenge.

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:26.660
Just saying.

01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:35.420
Anyway, it came out for PlayStation, published by Square, released in Japan on June 1994

01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:42.460
and in the U.S. January 1998 by Sony Computer Entertainment, the very first of the Tactics

01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:45.980
series in the Final Fantasy franchise.

01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:52.300
And it's the first game that's set in the fictional world, later known as...

01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:54.820
Is it Ivalice, I think?

01:33:54.820 --> 01:34:05.140
So it follows Ramza Bolv, I guess I can't pronounce that, who is a cadet who is in a

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:11.700
military conflict called the Lion War and about the stuff going on with it.

01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:21.980
Anyway, production began in 1995 by Matsuno Yasumi, who had created Ogre Battle with Quest.

01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:35.940
But there was a desire to do a tactic game that involved class-based conflict and writing

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.540
history.

01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:41.380
And so they were that director and writer.

01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:47.740
And then Sakaguchi Hironobu, who was the Final Fantasy creator, was a producer and they just

01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:59.900
got more and more awesome people in as they kept doing, including Iwata as a composer.

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:06.740
So at any rate, the game is...

01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.220
Actually this is a different Iwata, I don't know why I said that.

01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:16.660
This is Masaharu, but moving forward.

01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:25.660
The game itself, it really pushed some boundaries when it came out.

01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:30.580
So we're basically going to go into a little bit of that gameplay.

01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:32.120
It's a tactics game.

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:36.700
So you follow your protagonist through the game and you have two modes, you have battles

01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:38.700
and world map.

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:45.620
Battles will be on isometric fields and you move them by tiles and they have different

01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:55.780
attacks and it is turn-based, although they have a charge time that is going into play

01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:57.440
inside those battles.

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:00.700
You have your hit points for your enemies, your hit points yourself, you get experience

01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.700
points as you go along.

01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:08.880
And in the world map, you move on these paths connecting towns and battle points.

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.140
And of course, when your character icon is on the town, you can open a menu there where

01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:17.060
you can go to the bar to look for side quests or shop for supplies or soldier office for

01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:18.900
recruiting.

01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:23.780
You also can go to fur shops that you get for poaching.

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:25.700
Don't approve of that, but whatever.

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:28.660
You do get some random battles.

01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:37.460
And then if you go over these certain green spots, then you will get another random encounter.

01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:41.060
It does have a character class system that lets you customize your characters into different

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:42.060
roles.

01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:48.100
So you have most of the original character classes from Final Fantasy games, like summoners,

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:54.660
black mages, white mages, monks, dragoons, and thieves.

01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:58.060
Black mages were called wizards, white mages were called priests, and dragons were called

01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.220
lancers.

01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:06.060
You have new, you start out as either a squire or a chemist, which is the base for either

01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:12.780
a warrior or magician job, and it has like 20 something jobs.

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:17.580
You get job points that you can apply to your different jobs as well.

01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:21.180
And then when you've learned all the abilities in that job class, you're considered mastered

01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:24.900
and you can learn something else.

01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:34.340
So at any rate, it was actually conceived in 93 by Sakaguchi, who loves tactics games.

01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:40.260
And he was unable to work on it at the time due to the main series.

01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:50.300
But eventually things came together and they were, he teamed up with Matsuno, of course,

01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:54.820
like I said, who worked on the Ogre Battle series, and when Tactics Ogre Let Us Cling

01:37:54.820 --> 01:38:01.860
Together was done, then they went over and started working on the game.

01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:12.060
It was, the music in and of itself was also written by two people who worked on Ogre Battle,

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:18.620
so Iwata Masaharu and Sakimoto Hitoshi.

01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:26.340
They worked on that and they actually did release CDs by DigiCube on June 21st, 1997,

01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:30.620
and re-released by Squenix on March 24th, 2006.

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:33.740
So there were other versions.

01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:38.380
Tactics first came out, like I said, June 20th, 1997, and it came bundled with a demo

01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:40.820
disc for Saga Frontier.

01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:48.460
And then the English localization was outsourced, although part of the localization had been

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:55.920
done by Square USA's Michael Baskett and did a script kind of like Old English, but it

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:59.900
made it really hard to understand the games that was toned down.

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:09.020
It came out in North America January 28th, 1998, and it also was re-released to Square's

01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.500
Millennium Collection.

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:17.260
This series was released in Japan and each title had its own set of different merchandise.

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:24.020
Final Fantasy Tactics was sold June 29th, 2000, along with Saga Frontier, Saga Frontier

01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:32.780
2, Brave Fencer Musashi, Front Mission 3, Ergeiz, and Legend of Mana.

01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:39.100
It was selected to be part of the Greatest Hits re-releases four years after its initial

01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:44.380
release, and then it also then became a part of the Ultimate Hits, which was their budget

01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:45.380
range in Japan.

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:51.500
There was a PSP PlayStation Portable version called Final Fantasy Tactics The War of the

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:57.580
Lions came out May 10th, 2007 in Japan and then other places after.

01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:02.780
Second game is part of the Ivalice Alliance.

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:07.420
It also had an updated version of the original Final Fantasy Tactics with in-game cutscenes,

01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:10.700
new characters, and multiplayer.

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:16.220
It also updated to a 16.9 widescreen support, new items, new jobs, cel-shaded full motion

01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:17.220
videos.

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:23.020
And the English version has voice acting where the Japanese version does not.

01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:30.940
The game sold almost 825,000 copies in Japan in the first half of 1997 and ended with 1.24

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:33.700
million copies sold.

01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:40.540
By the end of 2007, it had sold approximately 1.3 million copies in Japan and then, as of

01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:46.420
August 2011, 2.4 million copies worldwide.

01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:48.940
It was greatly lauded.

01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:54.140
People thought that it was challenging and required, you know, definitely more strategy

01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:57.180
and a little bit more involvement.

01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:02.900
The spell effects, 3D backgrounds, the camera being rotatable, zooming, all of that.

01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:07.660
Other reviewers didn't really like it, but they don't count.

01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:13.340
There's some people who said it should have been 2D, man, like no.

01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:27.100
It just really, the story especially was praised, although having so many characters look similar

01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:30.860
made it hard to distinguish who was who.

01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:39.260
And of course, the English localization was overrun with grammatical mistakes, so I'm

01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:40.380
just saying.

01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:45.420
Like I was telling the people who did Hooked on You, get a proofreader.

01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:48.620
But soundtrack, of course, was greatly praised.

01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:52.980
IGN gave the Editor's Choice Award in 1998.

01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:57.460
GameSpot listed as one of the greatest games of all time in 2007.

01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:01.180
It just, it won more and more and more.

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:07.420
So the world for Final Fantasy Tactics has been featured in other games.

01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:14.420
The development staff that did Vagrant Story also had references to Final Fantasy Tactics,

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:19.060
and they are both set in the same world.

01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:27.300
And Final Fantasy XII, when it was released, is also in the same world, the world of Ivalice.

01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:37.020
Final Fantasy XIII Revenant Wings was also supposed to have been sent in the same world.

01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:43.060
Final Fantasy Tactics Advance came out in 2003 and had a smaller cast of characters

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.500
and a little bit simpler of a plot.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:51.820
It's an indirect sequel, came out called Final Fantasy Tactics A2, Grimoire of the Rift.

01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:59.140
Ramza and Agrias were in the online card game Lord of the Million 3 in 2014.

01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:03.940
Ramza is playable in Dissidia Final Fantasy NT.

01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:11.780
In Final Fantasy XIV, A Realm Reborn had an alternate version of Ramza and his companions

01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:15.100
that died at the end of Tactics.

01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:19.020
So they're in Final Fantasy XIV.

01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:23.220
Final Fantasy Tactics is featured in the Final Fantasy Trading Card Game with Ramza, Delita,

01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:29.100
Agrias, and other characters appearing in Opus 1.

01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:32.660
Tactics has appeared in other of the Opuses.

01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:37.620
And there's a remix song of Avelia and Delita that was nominated for Best Game Music Cover

01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:45.860
Remix at the 16th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards.

01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:47.740
And that's it.

01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:50.060
Final Fantasy Tactics is ooze.

01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:51.460
All right.

01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:52.460
Great pick.

01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:57.300
I know it's not a game that you're personally into, but I kind of felt like what you were

01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:02.620
saying in the beginning about the whole, like, you know, this tactics isn't usually a genre.

01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:05.660
And even for me, I don't usually get into tactics.

01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:06.660
Tactical games is a genre.

01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:11.100
I don't get entertained by them very often, but I have a deep love of Final Fantasy.

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:13.020
So it was one of those things where I was like, I had to try this one.

01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:14.820
And I, I do, I do like it.

01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:21.860
I don't think I'm as into it as like some other people are, but I do find it very interesting

01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:25.140
that Square- You're not dating, but you're very good friends.

01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:26.140
Yeah.

01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:27.140
Yeah.

01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.700
You know, I have the phone number in my phone that I might want to call once in a while

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:30.700
when I'm feeling lonely.

01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:37.420
You know, it's just one of those things where it's like, I'm surprised that Square hasn't

01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:41.060
tried to do more of these games with how well received it.

01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:42.060
You know, yes.

01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:43.060
I know there was advances.

01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:44.060
I mean, I'm just surprised-

01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:45.060
Favorite story.

01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:46.060
They've done a few others.

01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:51.700
But I mean, specifically Final Fantasy, you know, but yeah, but I like what they did with

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:52.700
the job system.

01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:56.780
I liked, you know, that in the game and definitely you see this game's influence on other Final

01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:57.780
Fantasy games.

01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:02.500
Force 14, you know, some of the other things you named there in that.

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:03.500
But yeah.

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:07.060
So yeah, great pick, Final Fantasy Tactics.

01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:09.540
A real classic, if there ever was one.

01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:10.940
All right.

01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:15.900
Let's move on and talk about some other quick headlines around the gaming industry and some

01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:17.900
rapid fire news.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:18.900
We'll start with Loki.

01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:21.460
Everybody's got a podcast now.

01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:25.380
So- Well, we were first.

01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:26.540
We were one of the first guests.

01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:27.540
One of the first.

01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:38.420
So Sakurai has got his own podcast now on YouTube, or I should say it's like a YouTube

01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:42.700
series and talking about game development.

01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:44.820
So that's pretty cool.

01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:45.820
And then-

01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:48.720
He is allowed to do whatever he wants, including a podcast.

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:53.340
He's delivered on every wish that people have for the Smash Brothers series over the years.

01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:57.660
He's worked day and night and all the time in between on those games.

01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:58.660
You know what?

01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:04.380
If he wants to do a podcast, may it be the best podcast there ever was.

01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:08.140
Except for this one, of course.

01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:13.620
Also Hideo Kojima announced that he's got a podcast exclusively for Spotify.

01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:14.620
How dare he?

01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.620
It's called Brain Structure.

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:20.740
You can check that out there.

01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:25.780
And then, of course, we have an acquisition in the indie scape.

01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:32.020
So we've got Tiny Build has acquired a Bossa Studios, who are best known for their weird

01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:36.780
simulation games or weird like physics comedy games.

01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:41.900
So they have, of course, I Am Bread, Surgeon Simulator, I Am Fish.

01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:47.540
So those have been- that's been purchased by Tiny Build for $3 million.

01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:48.540
Great.

01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:49.540
Great.

01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:50.540
All right.

01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:51.540
Yeah.

01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:57.580
Darsakra, with, I think, some more insight on something that came up last week or the

01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:58.580
week before.

01:46:58.580 --> 01:46:59.580
Yeah.

01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:06.260
Except show role actually accidentally got closed, my apologies.

01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:11.100
So yeah, so I'm a fan of Guilty Gear.

01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:12.100
I like this series.

01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:16.300
I've cosplayed Baikon from it, much to my husband's chagrin because of how much cleavage

01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:18.620
it showed.

01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:23.460
But there's a character who has been problematic, and that's Bridget.

01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:33.340
Bridget originally was a boy raised as a girl, not necessarily choosing that as an identity,

01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:35.000
I reckon.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:44.900
But now they finally have just completely come out and said, no, she's trans.

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:52.220
She is, in fact, this is as of Guilty Gear Strive, that they confirmed that Bridget

01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:59.340
is transgender and that, but she had been using, people had used masculine pronouns

01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:07.380
toward her, but now she is officially being referred to as her correct gender.

01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:09.340
She's wearing, of course, the feminine clothes.

01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:15.480
She still always presented herself as a woman.

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:23.160
And so now she is still, she is now completely being referred to as a woman.

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:29.260
And it's about time, you know, she had been misgendered for an age.

01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:34.640
She was sort of like in this middle ground where they, you know, people were referring

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:39.760
to as, and I hate using the term, but people were refusing to her as a trap.

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.320
And that's completely unfair to the trans community.

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:47.480
It's completely disgust, you know, disgusting that people would do that.

01:48:47.480 --> 01:49:03.800
And so now like we've had in this one, so they've had a scene now in the arcade mode

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:10.340
where Bridget is talking with Dickinson and Kaikisuke about her self-discovering and how

01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:15.240
she's learned herself and that the final destination will be worthwhile.

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:23.120
And they agreed with her and they, you know, provided some advice, like legit advice, leave

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:28.320
behind the fear of prejudice, become who you were meant to be.

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:33.000
It's all worth the heartache to be your true self.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:42.860
And then she responds to a statement about being a cowgirl, like cowgirl is fine because

01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:45.380
I'm a girl.

01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:48.700
So I think that's awesome.

01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:55.080
And there's apparently other bits of dialogue in the game, but Arc System is really sticking

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:57.820
with this translation and they're doing a great, a great job.

01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:58.820
Yeah.

01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:00.980
Sounds like they've done some really good course correcting there.

01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:05.620
I know this, this kind of was first came up like a week or two ago when people were downloading

01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:10.100
that DLC, but it's nice that the company's kind of confirming it and, you know, giving

01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:11.580
that extra insight there.

01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:12.580
Pretty cool.

01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:22.460
And then also there's still, there's also the character of Testament who is a non-binary.

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:31.020
And this is both of the, both of their identities are built in now to the fabric of the story.

01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:46.100
And then of course the scene has been uploaded onto Twitter and I will be reposting that

01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:48.100
from my own Twitter.

01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:49.100
Cool.

01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.100
All right.

01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:53.220
Well, I don't follow, I have to admit, I don't follow Guilty Gear as closely.

01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:57.340
I just, I just haven't, I don't have time to play everything, but a fighting game franchise

01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:00.500
I have been keeping my eyes on over the years is Mortal Kombat.

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:05.580
And with Mortal Kombat celebrating its 30th anniversary, we're finding out some more details,

01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:10.900
just some behind the scenes stuff, which ironically in an interesting way, speaking of Dragon

01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:14.580
Con coming up, Bobby has a really cool panel.

01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:20.380
Bobby's getting to do a Mortal Kombat panel with, I forget, it's two of the mocap actors

01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:23.660
from the original game that are going to be on the panel.

01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:27.740
So, and I believe they had some hand, it's not like Ed Boon or anything.

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:32.540
It's, I think it's the brothers, Carlos, Pecina, and I can't remember the other guy's name,

01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:34.420
but they're going to be on the panel.

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:36.180
And I think that's going to be a fun one to see.

01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:40.100
So I'm hoping it doesn't conflict with any of my other panels so I can go watch it just

01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:43.380
as a fan of Mortal Kombat, the old school games.

01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:48.220
But Ed Boon has been dropping a lot of neat little things on Twitter and so forth, talking

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:53.620
this week about Sonya and how Sonya wasn't originally in the game, saying that on April

01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:58.340
10th, they tested an unfinished version of Mortal Kombat with only six fighters at a

01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:05.740
Chicago arcade called Times Square, the name of the arcade in Chicago, not New York, and

01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:08.060
talking about basically how Sonya was made from there.

01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:15.740
But Sonya started out as a character named Curtis Stryker, but they changed Curtis Stryker

01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:20.380
into Sonya Blade, but it ended up being the same backstory because they decided they wanted

01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:23.740
that fighter to be female, so they did a pivot there.

01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:31.140
But ironically, Curtis Stryker was basically Jax, so they did revisit that concept, but

01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:34.700
they made him Jax and put him in Mortal Kombat 2.

01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:37.620
And then, of course, you might go, well, wait a minute, isn't Stryker a name for Mortal

01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:38.620
Kombat?

01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:39.620
Yeah.

01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:43.060
Then they used the name Stryker in Mortal Kombat 3.

01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:46.940
So I just think that's kind of interesting how this original development for the character

01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:51.620
kind of ended up getting split out amongst all these other Mortal Kombat characters,

01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:53.660
but that's how development works sometimes.

01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:56.260
So I just thought that was some pretty cool insight.

01:52:56.260 --> 01:53:02.900
All right, let's move on, travel around the world for some release dates and see what

01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:06.660
games will be celebrating some 30th anniversaries in 2052.

01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:10.420

01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:41.420
A crayon Shin-chan?

01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:44.460
Looks like really bad artwork.

01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:49.700
Not crayon Shin-chan, it's like, I don't know, maybe?

01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:54.100
It's like slightly better than crayon, but yes, it's the same character.

01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:56.100
Okay, gotcha.

01:54:56.100 --> 01:55:04.940

All right, going to Japan.

01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:18.380
It's a little lighter this week.

01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:21.860
I seem to remember last week it was really, really packed, but this week we have just

01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:23.700
a few things on Nintendo Switch.

01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:27.340
On September the 1st, we have Made in Abyss, Binary Star Falling into Darkness.

01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:31.900
I think most of these overlap with U.S. games, but these are Japanese releases as well.

01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:32.900
That's on the Switch.

01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:37.180
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure All Star Battle R, also on the Switch in Japan this week.

01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:38.180

And The Lord of the Rings Golem gets its release in Japan.

01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:55.300
Switch this week.

01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:59.380

also getting its release on the PS5 this week in Japan.

01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:15.580
And Thymesia is also out on the PlayStation 5 this week.

01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:16.580
That's it.

01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:18.740
Let's go to Europe.

01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:26.660

For PlayStation and Switch, we have Super Bullet Break.

01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:49.300
For the three, we have Lego Brawls.

And PlayStation and Switch, Made in Abyss.

01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:00.180
All right.

01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:03.460
We have a few more news stories for you guys, and then we'll be inviting your phone calls

01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:08.420
over at vognetwork.com slash Discord in the green room.

01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:11.540
We'll get to any emails and tweets if we have any of those.

01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:14.660
But first, we have a few more stories for you.

01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:16.260
Loki!

01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:24.260
Yeah, so this is unfortunate news, but so there's a company called Toge Productions

01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:26.740
and Mojiken Studio.

01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:30.900
They had a point and click game coming out called A Space for the Unbound.

01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:40.500
And they were in negotiation with PQ Games, who had published Galgun in the past, to have,

01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:43.220
you know, publish that on consoles for them as well.

01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:47.380
And they were also going to handle the publishing in western regions.

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:56.340
However, they've had to terminate their contract with PQ Games because there's been some manipulation

01:58:56.340 --> 01:59:00.260
being done on behalf of PQ Games.

01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:09.940
So some of the things that they had done to them, one, they had obtained a grant basically

01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:21.060
for, it was a grant for an unnamed diversity fund, and they obtained it in PQ Games behalf,

01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:23.380
but then they withheld the money from them.

01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:31.700
Then also, they had tried using those funds as part of a negotiation tactic with them.

01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:37.700
So rather than giving them the money, they were hiding the fact that the grant had been

01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:44.180
awarded to them and added as recoupable minimum guarantee, and then used it to negotiate the

01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:45.860
increase of their revenue share.

01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:52.500
Also, PQ Games is refusing to grant them control over publishing again.

01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:56.580
So unfortunately, the game's kind of in limbo right now.

01:59:56.580 --> 02:00:02.420
But the company wants to make arrangements and ensure that it's published as intended

02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:05.540
in a way that's consistent with their community values.

02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:11.380
So yeah, that sounds like a lot of drama there.

02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:19.460
It says, the support has included offering a significant further funding over and above

02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:23.140
the grant funding to support development, importing, and marketing.

02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:29.860
This touch productions have sought for some time to unitally enforce the unreasonable

02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:36.420
revised terms of our agreement, and it's disappointing that as a result not achieving

02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:40.980
that, that despite PQ significant efforts to accommodate this, they have sought the

02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:43.060
deal with a matter this way.

02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:46.900
So basically, PQ is trying to say that, oh, we're not involved in that.

02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:51.780
Yeah, like, how dare they go public with this, you know, trying to make us look bad to try

02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:53.460
to resolve it this way, you know, in the

02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:58.100
sure that, yeah, it's in their best interest to, you know, small indies, it's in their

02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:03.940
best interest to try to piss off the publisher of their game, you know, and to try to throw

02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:07.140
them under the bus and shade them with untrue facts.

02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:08.820
I'm sure that's really what they're trying to do.

02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:10.580
Yeah, I don't think so.

02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:11.780
Okay.

02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:16.820
So I think the developers have also said that if they did go forward with the publishing

02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:23.940
through PQ, it says, or it says, oh, yeah, apparently players, of course, have decided

02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:27.620
to review bomb PQ for doing stuff like that.

02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:30.260
So, all right.

02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:33.380
All right, well, we'll move on to our next story.

02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:38.420
Dark Sakura had to step away for just a moment, so she'll come back to her thing at another

02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:39.220
time.

02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:43.140
So we'll move on to this story, which actually, I'm sorry, is also from Loki.

02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:44.500
We'll skip right back to you, Loki.

02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:45.700
All right, cool.

02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:52.980
So there's some leaked game, well, very brief gameplay from apparently a new Need for Speed

02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:54.660
title that has appeared online.

02:01:55.300 --> 02:02:00.580
It has, well, I mean, they haven't really announced a new Need for Speed game, but apparently

02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:08.660
it shows some footage of a, a barrel, a Bel Air crashing into some sort of donut shaped

02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:11.460
monument and like some of the art style and stuff with that.

02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:17.940
They said that the new Need for Speed would kind of combine like, you know, of photorealistic

02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:21.060
and then like kind of, they say anime elements.

02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:27.220
It's sort of like kind of graffiti almost elements to it, I guess.

02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:28.820
It's neat.

02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:31.220
It's a neat, uh, art style, I guess.

02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:35.060
But, um, yeah, I don't know.

02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:38.980
I'll be interested to see when they fully announce it.

02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:40.100
It doesn't tell us much, right?

02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:41.300
Open world though.

02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:45.140
Like, I mean, the way they kind of make it look, it looks open world and I'm all about

02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:49.380
an open world, like raising a game, like, uh, whether it be Need for Speed, kind of like

02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:54.020
Need for Speed, I think underground was open world, but, um, whether it be like that or

02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:56.580
like Burnout Paradise or something like that, I'm all down for that.

02:02:56.900 --> 02:03:01.860
Uh, I guess we'll have to wait and see whenever the hell they announce it.

02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:02.500
All right.

02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:02.900
We'll see.

02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:04.420
All right.

02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:08.580
And, uh, one more story for you tonight that is a little bit of a follow up to something

02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:09.940
we talked about last week.

02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:13.620
Um, last week I think Dark Soccer had brought up that unfortunately, um, a developer of

02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:17.700
some games that were published on Steam had passed away and that was, um, Rob Hale and,

02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:22.740
uh, the games that, um, he had developed, Waves and Waves 2, uh, ended up being given

02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:27.860
away on Steam, uh, as kind of like a tribute, you know, basically a post post-mortem.

02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:32.660
Um, and, uh, the interesting thing that's happened as a result of that, that I wanted

02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:39.620
to bring up tonight is that, uh, now a lot of fans are through Steam and through the

02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:44.180
review system, leaving like basically positive review bombing.

02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:47.060
Although I wouldn't call it review bombing because usually that's done with the intent

02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:48.020
to alter the score.

02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:51.940
I would say this is coming from a much different place where people are leaving their thank

02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:55.380
yous and their memories and so forth as, you know, Steam reviews.

02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:59.700
Uh, as of right now, Waves and Waves 2 have very positive ratings.

02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:03.780
Uh, and actually it should be noted they had those ratings before he passed too.

02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:08.900
So it should be clear this is not just a result of, uh, the game going free and so forth.

02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:14.820
Um, so, you know, a lot of people saying things like F-cancer, uh, RIP, you know, the typical

02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:18.580
things you would expect, um, to read, but, uh, yeah, just kind of interesting how that's

02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:22.340
sort of turned into a virtual memorial of sorts for the developer.

02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:26.260
Um, and, uh, you know, and I kind of talked about this last week on the show when, when

02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:30.420
Jamie originally brought up the story is it's one of those, you know, the, the art that

02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:34.100
you will leave behind and the lasting impact that it has on this world.

02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:39.540
Um, and it's, it's very clear that this gentleman, you know, put a lot into these games and now

02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:46.020
there's a lot of people that are appreciative and able to, um, you know, enjoy it, enjoy

02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:49.460
his work and, uh, have be impacted by art.

02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:55.700
It is unfortunate that he had to pass away for the game to get all the, um, you know,

02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:57.540
traction and publicity that it has.

02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:03.860
But, um, it's, it's, it's nice that at the end of the day, more people are able to play

02:05:03.860 --> 02:05:06.980
it and, um, are, are feeling so positive about it.

02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:12.180
Um, this pod culture says in chat review boosting, I wouldn't even, you know, again, you, you,

02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:16.900
yes, but no, you know, those terms are usually reserved for artificial types of things.

02:05:16.900 --> 02:05:20.340
Um, and I, again, I think what we're talking about tonight is very organic.

02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:24.660
Um, so you're, you're not wrong, but also I just, I just don't like using those labels

02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:30.260
that typically go for things like, you know, like Amazon sellers paying you to boost reviews

02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:30.820
and stuff like that.

02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:32.660
This is obviously from a much different place.

02:05:32.660 --> 02:05:36.820
Um, and I thought it was just a nice little follow-up, uh, and a reminder, if you haven't

02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:41.940
picked up waves or waves to Nash chance, they're free on steam.

02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:43.060
All right.

02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:48.180
With that, we move into the listener round table tonight, and we welcome your calls over

02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:50.900
at vog network.com slash discord.

02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:53.780
Uh, you can join the green room if you'd like to be on the show tonight and we'll get to

02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:54.820
some of your calls.

02:05:54.820 --> 02:06:00.580
We would usually also get to your emails, but I believe we don't have any tonight.

02:06:00.580 --> 02:06:03.380
At least last I checked, we didn't have any emails.

02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:05.380
So let's say, that's what I thought.

02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:08.740
So, uh, participate at orange laundry.com.

02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:12.100
If you want to send us an email for a future week.

02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:17.540
Uh, meanwhile, I will mention on Twitter because there's a, I know there was a follow-up to

02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:21.140
last week's email because Ziba tweeted, I don't remember.

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:23.140
She just tweeted at me or she tweeted the OLR account.

02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:25.060
She might've just tweeted it at me, but I'm going to repeat it.

02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:30.260
Anyway, that presentation of clue that's happening in final fantasy is getting delayed.

02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:32.020
They had to push it back a week.

02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:35.060
So now I really can't see it because I'm going to be at dragon con.

02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:36.900
It was supposed to be this last Saturday.

02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:42.180
They pushed it back a week because the island sanctuary is so popular.

02:06:42.180 --> 02:06:47.380
It's been hosing the servers and people are having problems getting into the housing wards.

02:06:47.380 --> 02:06:52.900
So, uh, it's not like, it's not as bad as some of the server problems they've had, but

02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:57.860
I think the people putting on this play kind of knew it's just going to make a bad situation

02:06:57.860 --> 02:06:59.540
worse if we overdo that.

02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:00.980
So they pushed it out a week.

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:04.580
So unfortunately I will have to wait and see the YouTube for that, um, which I really hope

02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:07.700
somebody puts on YouTube or at least a VOD or something like that.

02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:09.380
Cause I'd really love to see that.

02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:11.780
At some point it sounds really cool.

02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:15.700
So, um, but that's it for emails and tweets.

02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:19.540
Um, but let me go to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories tonight.

02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:23.220
Maybe I did have one thing that's just a fun little mention.

02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:28.980
So there is a brand new mod for Spiderman for PC.

02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:30.500
Cause you gotta love those Spiderman.

02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:34.500
Oh no, not after last week, but I, if you're bringing it up, then this one's got to be

02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:36.260
better than the tone from last week.

02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:38.420
It allows you to play as Kermit the Frog.

02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:42.740
And it looks amazing.

02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:45.380
To which I would say, yay!

02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:48.740
Time for the flail.

02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:56.020
As the show on her mountain chat says, yes, that mod is amazing.

02:07:56.020 --> 02:07:56.420
So yes.

02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:59.860
Questbuster chat says your friendly neighborhood frog.

02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:00.360
Yes.

02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:07.640
They, then there's of course other ridiculously borderline offensive mods where like, it's

02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:12.440
not like offensive bad, like kind of like really, uh, where someone has modded uncle

02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:16.600
Ben's gravestone as your playable character and it's remastered.

02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:19.160
It's just stupid.

02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:24.920
It's yeah, it's probably in poor taste, but a very different type of poor taste than what

02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:26.280
we were talking about last week.

02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:28.680
So the current, the frog though, that's, that's hilarious.

02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:29.880
Yeah, no, I love that.

02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:33.640
That's, that's, that's the absurdest shit that mods are for.

02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:34.760
Thank you very much.

02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:35.480
Me, Kermit.

02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:41.640
I can't, I couldn't help but start thinking of the, uh, sense of me a street.

02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:43.160
Listen, frog.

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:45.020
Kermit!

02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:47.560
And the number R.

02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:53.560
Um, oh, S2100Matt had said something about this to me on Twitter.

02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:57.240
Since we didn't get emails tonight, we can do drag race talk and believe it.

02:08:57.240 --> 02:08:59.640
S2100Matt is bringing up drag race.

02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:06.760
So SSJ100Matt says, speaking of drag race, Sarah Nurse, who is a Canadian hockey star

02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:13.160
and is a guest judge on Canadian drag race is now the first woman to be on an NHL game

02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:15.240
cover with another player.

02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:21.000
Well, we're going to give the gold star of the night to SSJ100Matt for being the first

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:26.120
listener in recent memory anyway, that has successfully connected drag race to video

02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:26.840
games.

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:27.720
Thank you.

02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:32.680
And actually made drag race a relevant topic of discussion here on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:33.800
Kudos to you.

02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:35.080
I will take a step back though.

02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:37.400
And there was the drag queen fighting game that we brought up.

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:37.880
There was.

02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:41.880
That's why I said in recent memory and not that a listener brought up.

02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:43.560
And hockey and hockey and hockey.

02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:44.040
That's true.

02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:44.680
That's true.

02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:45.240
You've tied all this.

02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:52.440
So though I can tell you now that it's been a week out, uh, for celebrity drag race.

02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:56.120
I didn't watch this last episode yet, but I was shook last week.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.760
Because you know who it was?

02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:00.200
I, I heard.

02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:00.360
Yeah.

02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:02.440
Well, I haven't watched, but I get spoiled on Twitter.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.040
So I can say it.

02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:04.280
Sure.

02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:04.680
Why not?

02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:06.600
It was Taylor Dane.

02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:08.040
I'm like, Holy shit.

02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:11.160
I had a feeling it was, it was like a nineties singer.

02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:14.840
It's like that the voice she carries herself, that could be Taylor Dane.

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:17.880
And I was like, Oh, although I know who a few of the others are.

02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:20.920
So I'm just saying, I'm pretty sure I know who they are.

02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:21.160
Taylor.

02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:22.680
Day was on the mass singer recently too.

02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:23.640
She didn't win.

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:28.520
But, um, it's nice to see her making a comeback of sorts on all these C-list reality shows.

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:33.720
Cause I always wondered like she was, she was huge in the nineties and like disappeared.

02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:35.640
Um, what?

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:36.920
I had to do a sad thing though.

02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:39.160
I had to tell Elsie who new kids on the block were.

02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:40.440
Oh no.

02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:43.480
Oh, kids today.

02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:45.160
Kids today.

02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:52.200
But I love, I love Taylor Dane.

02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:56.920
And if you've never heard the comic, um, and she's on star Trek too.

02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:59.320
Randomly, Tig Notaro, you probably know who she is.

02:10:59.320 --> 02:10:59.720
You know her.

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:06.120
If you saw her very famous, um, lesbian comic has this whole routine around Taylor Dane.

02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:06.840
That's great.

02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:08.760
And it's on YouTube and it's definitely worth a listen.

02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:10.840
Oh, Rob, tell it to my heart.

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:15.480
Tell it I'm the only one.

02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:17.960
Is this really love or is it, is it just a game?

02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:18.520
Just a game.

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:23.640
We, when I was, gosh, was I in early high school?

02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:24.280
Hold on, hold on.

02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:24.680
Loki.

02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:25.800
Do you know who Taylor Dana is?

02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:32.440
Love will lead you back someday.

02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:37.480
I just know that love will lead you back to my heart.

02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:39.080
Yes.

02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:39.560
Okay.

02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:40.440
Taylor Dane, you ain't.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:41.560
No, I'm not.

02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:46.360
Can you believe I don't play karaoke games on stream?

02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:54.600
I remember the one time I asked you to sing something at karaoke and I forgot that.

02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:56.920
I didn't realize that it wasn't quite in your range.

02:11:57.480 --> 02:12:01.400
I forgot how much that, uh, bird house in your soul has a weird key.

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:01.800
Oh yeah.

02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:02.600
It doesn't have a weird key.

02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:03.000
Yeah.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.600
That was the last song I ever asked you to sing karaoke for me, uh, faces before they

02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:14.360
started getting, you know, I, I, my go to, um, karaoke songs.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.160
Are hand in my pocket by Alanis Morissette.

02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:19.480
And I can pretty much see anything off a jagged little pill.

02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:22.200
And I don't even need the words on the screen, uh, or ABBA.

02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:25.400
What can I, what can I say?

02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:31.960
Mine are band on the run by Paul McCartney and wings, but I love that song.

02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:32.520
This is fun.

02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:33.800
It's like three songs in one.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.720
And, um, yeah.

02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:43.160
And, um, she's trapped in here with me or am I trapped in here with her?

02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:47.560
But, um, also, uh, lady fingers by Luscious Jackson.

02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:48.280
Oh, that's a good song.

02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:49.320
I love that song.

02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:49.960
Yeah.

02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:51.480
Those are like my big two.

02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:59.880
Although I was in my car, I made myself a nineties, uh, girl playlist and I was belting

02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:02.040
out crucify today and that might become my new song.

02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:03.400
All right.

02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:04.440
I love Tori Amos.

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:12.120
Cause you know, she was the, the, uh, tree in, uh, starstruck the beginning in the book.

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:13.800
She was the tree.

02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:15.400
All right.

02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:21.080
Well on those completely random tangent notes, let's go ahead and end this where it began

02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:21.960
with tangents.

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:25.640
Uh, but before we get to our final thoughts, I want to say thank you as always for listening

02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:26.760
to orange launch radio.

02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:30.040
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, or even if you didn't, you could still help

02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:32.120

02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:35.240
So, uh, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:37.080
show where every gamer has a voice and dang it.

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:39.160
We need more voices here on Sunday night.

02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:43.480
Uh, we love the ones we have, including Michigan's mom, who is the biggest Taylor

02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:44.200
Dane fan.

02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:45.560
Well, well welcome.

02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:47.720
Uh, you can get, you're in good company.

02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:49.880
We love Taylor day, uh, even Loki.

02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:52.920
So, uh, but help us expand our live audience.

02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:54.760
Uh, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:56.120
Uh, podcast is great too.

02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:57.640
A nice five star review.

02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:01.880
Uh, we love our podcast listeners, a nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, wherever

02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:03.800
it is you found this show, those go an awful long way.

02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:05.800
So we really appreciate those as well.

02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:06.280
All right.

02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:11.800
We will be back in two weeks, even though the sidebar says next week, I will be here

02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:12.280
next week.

02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:13.880
I mean, dark soccer might be streaming.

02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:14.840
Loki might be streaming.

02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:16.280
I don't know, but we will be streaming.

02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:23.000
I will be doing, uh, I talked to, to finara and we're, we are going to be doing swifts.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.640
We will invite anyone who wants to play a dead by daylight with us swell.

02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:35.240
Um, at, at Showtime, which is free on PlayStation pluses, uh, thing right now, if, if you have

02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:36.280
that and need the game.

02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:41.240
So there's a lot of weight and you need a meat shield will be your meat shield.

02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:41.560
All right.

02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:42.520
There you go.

02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:45.320
Um, that's, that's, uh, that's it.

02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:46.920
Uh, let's, let's wrap up.

02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:48.360
We'll see you again in two weeks.

02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:49.400
Let's get final thoughts.

02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:50.200
Uh, dark soccer.

02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:52.360
I will start with you cause I know you are going to go stream here in a moment.

02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:58.680
So they released the patch notes coming up for the new chapter and everything.

02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:01.640
And I still don't think that's going to stop the camping and tunneling situation.

02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:05.080
They just need to make it to where the struggle timer stops.

02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:09.560
Uh, in relation to proximity of killer to hook in the story.

02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:10.060
I agree.

02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:11.740
All right.

02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:13.080
Have a good one.

02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:15.320
Happy surviving later tater.

02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:15.960
All right.

02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:18.280
And let's go to Loki and your final thought tonight.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.720
Uh, I'm hoping to get an episode out this week.

02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:22.920
It's been a while.

02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:26.200
It's been a few weeks, but that's because I'm building a very large build.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.880
It is the large it's large.

02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:30.680
It's very large.

02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:35.400
Uh, my final thought is I cannot wait for dragon con.

02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:37.480
I'm so excited to be back home.

02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:40.200
I know it's going to be another kind of kind of weird year.

02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:42.680
Last year was a really weird year, but I still had a lot of fun.

02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:44.600
This year is going to be kind of a weird year.

02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:47.720
But we're, we're slowly getting back to what it used to be.

02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:50.680
I hope everybody has a great and safe dragon con.

02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:51.880
Can't wait to meet people.

02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:53.720
And I hope whatever you're doing labor day weekend.

02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:57.640
I know I won't shut up about dragon con cause that's what I do, but whatever you do during

02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:59.480
labor day weekend, I hope you have a good one.

02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:00.520
I hope you have a lot of fun.

02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:02.440
Stay safe.

02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:06.520
And if nothing else, tell it to my heart.

02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:09.000
Tell it I'm the only one.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.720
Is this really love or just a game?

02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:15.160
