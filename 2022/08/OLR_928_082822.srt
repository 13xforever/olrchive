1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,680
In the era of mass storage and everything, connectivity by default, gaming adapts to

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,860
make continued use of it like everything else.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,620
Instead of getting an entire game upfront, published to physical media and then going

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,780
unchanged, now more games can push a solid foundation and continue developing it as time

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,780
goes on.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,940
Tonight, we discuss an OG of PC gaming that continues this trend.

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,080
This is my leading commentary with no proper noun.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,020
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,840
the game and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,380
every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,540
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,660
where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,780
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 928 of our

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,840
show for tonight, August 28th of 2022.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,680
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me on this program, as they always do, say hello

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,800
first and foremost to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,480
Hi, how are you doing?

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm feeling better.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,160
I went back to work, but I've had to leave early both days because my cough was kind

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,960
of bad and my throat hurt, but I'm getting better, staying longer, working through it.

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
There you go.

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,400
Well, I'm glad you're improving, even if not maybe at 100% yet.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm glad it's getting better.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
That's good.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Yeah.

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,360
And I've found some extra supplements that have been helping with the brain fog, so that's

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
really good.

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Oh, that is good.

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
So, okay.

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Yeah.

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,800
I'll pass on more later, or if anyone wants to know.

32
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Excellent.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,520
Let's also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Hello.

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Hi, Loki.

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
How are you?

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Okay.

38
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,040
So, I have to ask of this game that's playing behind you tonight, because this is not a

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
Mega Man game I recognize.

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,280
And actually, quickly, let me, of course, say for those on the podcast feed, I'm talking

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,440
about the video that we're seeing live at twitch.tv, because we do tape live every Sunday

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,440
night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

43
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,520
VOG Network, or VOG Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

44
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,440
And although it is Orange Lounge Radio and not Orange Lounge Video, once in a while,

45
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,880
I can't help but notice some things on video that I have to call out.

46
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,000
And one of these is this Mega Man game I don't recognize playing behind Loki tonight.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What's going on here?

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,360
So, this is a fan game, it's called Mega Man Ram, and it's by a guy called Jay Bit.

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Okay.

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,840
Not to be confused with Mega Ran, the famous nerdy musician, rapper, individual, who I

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,400
think was on the show once a long time ago.

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Like Nerdcore.

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Yeah, like Nerdcore.

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Yeah, I believe he was.

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
I think he was.

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
He was on the show a long time ago.

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
A while ago, yeah.

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Yeah.

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
So, well, I hope he's doing well.

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,360
Shout out to Mega Ran, who I think, I think, I could be wrong, but like me, will be at

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,600
Dragon Con this coming weekend.

63
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,600
So, for those that I have met at Dragon Con who might be hearing this episode, and it's

64
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,400
their first taste of OLR, hello and welcome, and hope you enjoy the show this week.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,320
Myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki, we all met playing a little video game called Dance Dance

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Revolution.

67
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,300
Yes, that infamous music game.

68
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,840
We met playing that game a long time ago, over 20 years ago, if you can believe it,

69
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,940
at Roseville Golf Land, playing that game.

70
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,220
And we thought, you know what, we love this so much, and we love getting together with

71
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,340
our friends afterwards, and just sitting around talking about video games.

72
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,220
We're going to start a show online where we talk about video games.

73
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,600
And here we are, all these years later, and we invite all of you to sit at the table with

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,960
us after gaming, after a long night of gaming every week, as we do here on Sunday night,

75
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,620
and invite you all to participate along with the show.

76
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,900
So there's our little reintroduction of the show, as we tend to do.

77
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,220
Coming to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network, thank you, Sean322 donated

78
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,660
some biddies because of the shout out to Mega Ran.

79
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,140
Well, unfortunately, Mega Ran doesn't get any of that money, so make sure you stream

80
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,060
the music, buy the album, make sure you support the talent that is Mega Ran.

81
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,140
And Dark Tetsuya says, speaking about the game playing behind Loki tonight, it didn't

82
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,700
look like Mega Man 9 or 10, so my first thought was some wild rom hack.

83
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,140
You know, I always underestimate, I don't, but it's one of those out of sight, out of

84
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,140
minds.

85
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,460
I always underestimate what the homebrew community can do.

86
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,340
Like, I don't, like the fact that a homebrew person made this doesn't surprise me at all,

87
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,700
but I just like, you know, it's kind of one of those out of sight, out of mind things.

88
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
You don't keep tabs on it.

89
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,700
It's like, whoa, whoa, somebody made like a complete Mega Man game from scratch?

90
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,820
Of course they did.

91
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,820
Of course they did.

92
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,380
It wasn't even a rom hack either.

93
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,380
So yeah, it's pretty cool.

94
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:47,620
So they made a Mega Man, they made a Mega Man PC game better than the Mega Man PC port.

95
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,620
I think, which of which I think there were two.

96
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,100
Did you, okay.

97
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,740
Did you ever play the original Mega Man PC that was like CGA graphics?

98
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,780
It was like three bosses.

99
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,780
I did.

100
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,780
I bought it at the store.

101
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,980
I think I must have bought it at the store, but no, it was not good.

102
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,340
It was like Volt Man was one of them.

103
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,060
There was, but yeah, it's like a long lost Mega Man game.

104
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,440
They had robot bosses that weren't in any of the other games.

105
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,220
So yeah, I think there are some that they actually did bring out to other games later

106
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,220
on.

107
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,660
Um, and also those bosses were featured in the comics too.

108
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
Yeah.

109
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,700
I know I've been really brushing up on my Mega Man since, you know, doing the Minecraft

110
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
stuff.

111
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,700
What's up with this?

112
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
You going on Mega Man Jeopardy?

113
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,060
Like what's, what's no, I'm, I've been in the Wiki a lot, a lot, a lot.

114
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,820
So like, you know, there's a lot of that stuff that I run into, but yeah, so there's, um,

115
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,820
yeah, there's some of the bosses that were in the PC one that actually ended up making

116
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,420
it to like the Archie comics or whatever, uh, which was pretty cool.

117
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,300
Um, and I think there was one guy though that was part of three that ended up getting remade

118
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,900
for another game later on, um, or in try and chat says those two dos games actually have

119
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,220
a pretty interesting history.

120
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,220
Yeah.

121
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,100
So you're not the only one that's spent many a night on Wikipedia or whatever, reading

122
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,580
about dos based Mega Man games that most people forgot about.

123
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,060
So love it.

124
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
All right.

125
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,060
Well, we didn't forget about, uh, lots of big announcements going on this week because

126
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,540
of Gamescom, which, um, did happen this week, uh, which is newsworthy in itself because

127
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,820
you know, E3, which is like the big thing that happens in the US every year hasn't really

128
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:24,900
happened for a little bit since COVID, um, came so, but Gamescom out in Germany and Europe,

129
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,500
it did happen this week and they did the, uh, what they split it up into like a business,

130
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,180
um, and, um, uh, public event, right?

131
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,020
They do like two days of business, three days public, something like that.

132
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,500
So they do like a combined thing and, uh, it all kicked off this week with some announcements

133
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:48,580
and the, I guess, should we call it much anticipated Jeff Keighley world premiere fest rollout

134
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,620
of Gamescom opening night world premiere.

135
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,460
I didn't get to watch it live because of the Europe timeframe.

136
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,580
It was like 11 AM for me and I have a lot going on at work right now.

137
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,060
So I can't like step away to watch something for God.

138
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,980
It was probably like two hours, so it was a long time.

139
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,980
So I got, it was a while.

140
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,980
Yeah.

141
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:14,980
There's no way I was a little behind to start it, but like I did skip around, um, a bit.

142
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,420
There's a few announcements like, eh, I don't care about that, but like there was a lot

143
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,540
of other things that were interesting, but they, I did, I did watch it.

144
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,660
Some might send my life to Jeff's credit and the whole production team, usually with his

145
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,740
friends, there's some things you're into and some things you're not.

146
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,220
And that's to be expected because he wants to reach a diverse player base.

147
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
Right?

148
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,220
So there's going to be a little bit of everything, right?

149
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
Yeah.

150
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,220
There's not, it's no, no big deal that like, you know, that stuff's in there.

151
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,740
I mean, there's, it was a lot of great games that were announced.

152
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,000
It wasn't anything like, Oh, that's super boring.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,980
It's more of like, Hey, that looks cool, but I'm not gonna play that.

154
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,180
So let's talk about some of the things that were announced.

155
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,180
Let me start with this.

156
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,420
Cause I know you can run down the whole laundry list, but let me just kind of ask for you

157
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,660
and Jamie, if she has anything, but is there anything that like jumped out that you're

158
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,420
like, Oh, this is interesting to me or was it a surprise?

159
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,220
Surprise the Liza P was surprising as I, Oh, they're making that into a soul's like, okay,

160
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,220
cool.

161
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,220
It is.

162
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,980
It is weird that that's a soul's like, but artistically it does.

163
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,300
I think it looks cool.

164
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,940
I'm pissed off that Sonic frontiers in Japan gets a V tuber.

165
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,940
Really?

166
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
Yeah.

167
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,360
Um, not here.

168
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,560
They have a collaboration with like a pretty top of V tuber over there.

169
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Huh?

170
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Interesting.

171
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
I'll have to find the information.

172
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,600
I thought I was going to put it in show role and then I decided not to, but I'll, uh, I'll

173
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,080
see if I can find it.

174
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:47,120
The thing that I was most excited about that was, I should say surprising, um, ironically

175
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,560
enough is killer clowns from outer space.

176
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,800
He's so love that movie.

177
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,280
And so I'm super excited.

178
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,780
I have pretty decent coulrophobia.

179
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:04,280
So like even in dead by daylight, if I play clown, I, I put the chicken hat on him so

180
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,520
that he doesn't look like a clown.

181
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,160
I was just saying that that purple elephant thing is very, I don't have that cause it

182
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,560
costs dairy shards.

183
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,720
Oh, so I just put him in like a regular like red suit and the chicken hat.

184
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,920
Well, if, if this game comes out on PE, certainly you're not the only one in the world that

185
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
has an aversion to clowns.

186
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,240
And I, I, if this game ends up out on PC, I guarantee that's one of the first mods they're

187
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
going to make.

188
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't know if it'll turn them into chickens, but something, something not really clowns.

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They're aliens.

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But anyway,

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,560
so I found, I found, uh, the thing, by the way, real quick about, uh, uh, Sonic frontier

193
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:49,520
in Japan, uh, the amazon.co.jp pre-order comes with a korone inugami, uh, collaboration,

194
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,440
which is basically, uh, the character in a vtuber outfit.

195
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:01,520
Um, and the DLC changes the sound effects to, uh, inugami's voice, uh, for geo that

196
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:08,760
is geo online or game dealer, um, an acrylic panel that has Sonic, uh, x korone inugami

197
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:18,320
collection illustration, uh, done by artist, uh, hookahire, um, for, uh, joshindenki.

198
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,400
It's uh, uh, korone inugami collaboration DLC, uh, gloves and shoes that Sonic gets

199
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,720
to wear.

200
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,880
And then there's, uh, for Rakuten, there is, uh, koroneski, which is, uh, it changes the

201
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:44,360
appearance of the Coco character to, uh, koroneski, which is like this kind of laughing head.

202
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:52,560
I'll put, I'll put the link in here for our, uh, our chat so they can, they can see, uh,

203
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
what those look like.

204
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,120
My curiosity has certainly peaked with, um, Sonic Frontiers.

205
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,720
Like I, I know there's a lot of people kind of dogging on the footage that we've seen

206
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,920
so far, but I'm, I'm, I'm open to it.

207
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:10,200
I, I'm, I, I, I've learned a long time ago to very much not read one way or two or another

208
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,320
too much into these types of previews for good, for better and for worse.

209
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,300
Um, so I, I just want to see, you know, nothing says it like just raw gameplay footage on

210
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,480
YouTube or Twitch.

211
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,240
And that's, you know, what ultimately is going to really, um, make my decision.

212
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
So I'm curious about it.

213
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,320
Well that said though, I have seen raw gameplay footage on YouTube and it looked very uninspiring

214
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,600
and boring, but like the whole thing too, like the art styles is very drab as well.

215
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,360
It's like, it screams default Unreal Engine game.

216
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,760
I mean, there's like no distinct art style to it.

217
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,840
Whereas like some of the other 3D Sonic games, even more recent ones are like very stylized

218
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
and stuff.

219
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
And I liked that.

220
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,640
I think they should be more stylized because right now it just looks so generic and bland.

221
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,400
It doesn't even look like a Sonic game.

222
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,920
So I mean, maybe it'll, maybe it'll pan out and be better, but like, it's just, it's not

223
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,920
leading off with a great, you know, great start.

224
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,160
And funny enough, like as of recently, a lot of these gut feelings that you get end up

225
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,080
holding true in the end.

226
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,600
So we'll see.

227
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,920
Um, before I mentioned the game that caught my attention, I wanted to go back quickly

228
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,760
to the last game we were talking about.

229
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,240
And sorry, Jamie, I know you're not a fan of the subject matter, but I want to focus

230
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,800
on the developers of that game because they made the Friday the 13th game.

231
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,640
And I always thought that game got a raw deal because that game could really be competing

232
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,000
in a sense with Dead by Daylight a little more if it hadn't just gotten destroyed by

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,080
trademark and licensing issues of the Friday the 13th franchise.

234
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:49,360
And ironically, I do think this whole story ends someday with a Friday the 13th chapter

235
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,520
for Dead by Daylight.

236
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Absolutely.

237
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,020
But, but I digress.

238
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,520
The game that came out before that was interesting and was gosh, only about like four or five,

239
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,720
six months before the original Dead by Daylight.

240
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,040
So it did kind of beat DBD to the whole 4v1 thing, although it played very differently.

241
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
It was very different.

242
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,120
So I can't, you know, you can't draw a direct line between those two games, but you certainly

243
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,080
can see what they have in common.

244
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,400
So I'm just very curious, okay, if we're going with sci-fi camp now, so obviously, obviously

245
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,960
we can't do horror now because Dead by Daylight's got the lock and you know, all that, but now

246
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,720
to go sci-fi camp with this is, is interesting.

247
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,600
So I'm curious to see what the developers do from that standpoint, because Friday the

248
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,760
13th had a lot of good ideas in it.

249
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,140
So I'm, I'm curious to see if, if it's even the same type of game, it may not be, it may

250
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,360
just end up being a completely different thing, but it is an ace, was it, was it, I think

251
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,000
it's 4v1 on that, this one as well.

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,760
So it's, it'd be interesting, it's going to be interesting.

253
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
So we'll see.

254
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,560
Anyway, the game that also caught my attention, because literally I felt like this game came

255
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:03,760
out of nowhere, was Dead Island 2, because to put this into context, the last E3 I went

256
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,920
to, which I want to say was like 2014, I think was the last E3 I went to, I remember going

257
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,140
to behind closed doors to see where this game was at at the time.

258
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,740
So that was eight years ago that I saw that game.

259
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,200
And now like it, I honestly forgot about it.

260
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,240
I think most of us did outside of that Goat Simulator 3, you know, that, that whole thing,

261
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,560
which I maybe was intentional to kind of bring it back to the forefront of mind.

262
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,920
I don't know.

263
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,320
Outside of that, like I had not thought about Dead Island 2 for a long time.

264
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,520
And then all of a sudden, ta-da, it's here and it's dated and done.

265
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,300
And there's a part of me that goes, well, that's neat.

266
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,480
And there's also a part of me that goes, that, that could be really bad because I feel like

267
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,680
that's what happened with Duke Nukem Forever, is that Duke Nukem Forever was gone for a

268
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
long time.

269
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,000
And then all of a sudden it was like, it's happening, enjoy.

270
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And nobody enjoyed.

271
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It looks polished.

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,820
I mean, well, but here's, here's the other thing.

273
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,800
The original Dead Island game, and Bobby and I were just reminiscing about this on his

274
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,560
side, his show, the original Dead Island game.

275
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,240
I wasn't really a fan of that either.

276
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,040
Like I reviewed it for VOG Network and I do not remember giving it a good grade.

277
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,440
Um, no, no, no bikini torso pre-order bonus this time.

278
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,840
But I know it's comfort food for some people, that series.

279
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,040
Like it's, it's, I don't want to say it's trash because that gives a negative context.

280
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,960
But what if I said like, it's Sharknado of games?

281
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Like there's a certain camp.

282
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,420
Yeah, but like, yeah.

283
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,140
But they're kind of like, see the thing with Dead Island though is even kind of annoying

284
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:47,620
is that it's basically taking the Dead Rising format and just kind of doing that, but first

285
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
person.

286
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,540
So I don't know.

287
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
It looks all right.

288
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,380
I like the idea of like seven different killers or whatever in there that you can play as,

289
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,380
but eh, whatever.

290
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,380
It's fine.

291
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,300
Uh, dark to see in chat says it does look like a stupid, fun, good time.

292
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,100
And I mean, shouldn't most video games be a little bit stupid?

293
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,900
No, I said most, not all.

294
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,700
There's certainly some, some artistic, you know, pushing forward the medium things and

295
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,380
there's a time and a place for that, but it's, it's okay for a video game to be stupid.

296
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,060
Like, you know, that's, that's okay too.

297
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,080
Just like movies, just like movies, right?

298
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,400
Sometimes you want to sit down and watch an Oscar winner.

299
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,060
Sometimes you want to watch something stupid and that's okay.

300
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,420
Like video games should, should follow that exact same thing for sure.

301
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,860
Pod Culture said, you say Sharknado like it's a bad thing.

302
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:40,380
I wasn't saying it like it's a bad thing, but it, it, it fills a certain need in the

303
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,740
film industry that I would say Dead Island fills in the video game industry.

304
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,100
Well, I have to say there's exactly three games that grabbed my interest.

305
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Okay.

306
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
What's that?

307
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
All right.

308
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,300
Well, number one, and I've talked about it before, Vikings on trampolines.

309
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
It's a concept.

310
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,860
Um, another one, just given my own kind of history interest is pentiment.

311
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm really looking forward to that.

312
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,780
And uh, probably my very, very, very biggest, biggest, biggest thing that I super, super,

313
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:21,020
super, super, super want to play is uh, Lies of P.

314
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,860
That one, even though, even though that's a Souls-like.

315
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,160
Even though.

316
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,380
You know, you know what, Dark Soccer, this has been-

317
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,860
Just because it's like Souls doesn't mean it has to exactly be as hard as it.

318
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,860
You know what?

319
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
And you know what?

320
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,940
This, this is, this is the year to challenge our preconceived perceptions of games because

321
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,140
Dark Soccer, I remember when you wouldn't play first person games and then you were

322
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,060
a killer at Dead by Daylight for-

323
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,300
You know why I was a killer in Dead by Daylight?

324
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
I do.

325
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
I do.

326
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
But-

327
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,420
Because I thought the survivors had to do all kinds of crazy shit and it's true.

328
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:56,620
They have to do all kinds of crazy shit, but I thought that killer would be easier.

329
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,060
I also started as killer because I was like playing survivors too scary.

330
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,100
But when you're killer, I'm the one in control of the scare and it was, but then

331
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
I came around.

332
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,220
But anyway, that's not my point.

333
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,820
My point is we're all challenging our preconceived notions of games.

334
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
So why not?

335
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,820
Let's do a Souls-like.

336
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:19,460
It does look like, I got to say, like the artistic-ness of it, taking a Pinocchio-esque

337
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,420
type of thing and making it this is neat.

338
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,180
Like, you know, I'm more interested in this than the Tom Hanks live-action Pinocchio,

339
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,180
that's for sure.

340
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:37,460
Well, I mean, Callisto Protocol also is up on my list, you know, because I'm really interested

341
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,220
in seeing the mutation mechanic and what's going on.

342
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,620
I mean, Street Fighter 6 hopefully is better than Street Fighter 5, but, and I've already

343
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,940
been interested in Forspoken, even though I won't have any way to play it, but I'm really

344
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,300
also very interested though.

345
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:57,620
And I mentioned it was a pentiment because I follow a particular Twitter that's all about

346
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:03,220
badly drawn medieval animals, like how animals are drawn in medieval manuscripts and this

347
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:09,020
whole game looks like a medieval manuscript and I'm here for it.

348
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:15,020
Hey, sometimes it's just that little thing that jumps out at you and you're like, oh,

349
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,020
I got to, I got to see that.

350
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
I got to do that.

351
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,460
It's so, it's so just perfect.

352
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,660
Like I'm totally down for it, you know, with monks drawing and, and, you know, people doing

353
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,140
penance and it's just like, it's totally up my alley.

354
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,700
That and hearing about Kojima's podcast, I'm interested in that too.

355
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,880
associate100matt in chat says, Tom Hanks, all the things, here's, here's the thing.

356
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,180
It's not Tom Hanks that I have a problem with.

357
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,740
It's these live action Disney movies I have a problem with because none of them have been

358
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
good.

359
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,660
None of them have exceeded the original animation.

360
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,660
None of them.

361
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,940
I'm very concerned about the little mermaid and this has nothing to do with the casting

362
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
of Ariel.

363
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,220
I'm fine with that, but it does have everything to do with the casting of Ursula because it

364
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,860
should have been a drag queen, but I digress.

365
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
Fine.

366
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:08,140
Melissa McCarthy is close to a drag queen, but it's not going to be good.

367
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,380
It's not going to be good.

368
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,780
None of them have been good.

369
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,380
Aladdin was terrible.

370
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,380
Beauty and the Beast.

371
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,780
I almost walked out of that after the first 15 minutes.

372
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,780
It was so bad.

373
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
Lion King.

374
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,780
Not good.

375
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,600
Those Disney, none of those Disney live action remakes are good.

376
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
None of them.

377
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,700
So I don't know why this one's going to be any different.

378
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:32,420
Well, I mean, they did give you a drag, a fairy in the, uh, was it live action Pinocchio?

379
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,380
Oh, Oh, that's right.

380
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,380
That's right.

381
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,380
Who is playing it?

382
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,380
I don't know.

383
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,460
I forget, but it doesn't matter.

384
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,620
Wrong person asked about that.

385
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,000
It doesn't, you know, it doesn't matter.

386
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,260
It's still not going to be good.

387
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
It is.

388
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
It's so yeah.

389
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,260
Yeah.

390
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,740
It, that almost, no offense, but like, it seems almost pandering at that point.

391
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,180
It's like, well, let's just give them a reason to watch this because otherwise it's going

392
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,180
to be crap.

393
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,220
You know, like, I don't know.

394
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,700
It's um, bonds, double 06 says even Cruella.

395
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
Okay.

396
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Technicality.

397
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,740
That wasn't a remake.

398
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,900
That was, that also wasn't just a certain like, and Glenn Close in 101 Dalmatians and

399
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,100
that movie, I don't throw in with this recent trend that was in the nineties.

400
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
Okay.

401
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,660
I'm talking about the more recent trend.

402
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,540
We'll, we'll forgive Glenn Close because she's Glenn Close and you know, Cruella was more

403
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,420
of an original story, but um, yeah, these other more modern remakes anyway, I digress.

404
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,460
We're talking about video games, but I get me started on Disney and I will go off on

405
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
Disney.

406
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,460
Okay.

407
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:38,100
Anyway, uh, Loki, um, I know dark soccer named a lot of stuff there.

408
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,340
I named, what else did we miss that we should talk about from the Gamescom opening ceremony?

409
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,340
I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff.

410
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,300
They have a new, they have a game coming out for Dune, Dune Awakening that looks pretty

411
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
awesome.

412
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
MMO, isn't it?

413
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Yeah, it is.

414
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
And that could be interesting.

415
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Yeah.

416
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,700
I'm just going to, if I made a character in that, she'd just sit around high on spice.

417
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,180
Her eyes glowing blue, staring vacantly out into the dirt.

418
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,420
Now I'm going to have to make a lady character in that game too, so that dark soccer and

419
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,740
I can have a Guild called the spice girls like, and I'm sure we're not the only ones

420
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,900
thinking this, but I'm hoping we're the first to say it on a podcast.

421
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,900
And so I'm going to say patent pending trademark, um, copyright names in the game have to be

422
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:33,140
like off-brand spice girl names, like, like you can be like pumpkin spice and, and I

423
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,380
can be, uh, we need a dude to be old spice.

424
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
I mean, okay.

425
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
Loki can be old spice.

426
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,620
Look, you'll be old spice and I'll be, I'll be pumpkin spice.

427
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,180
I'll be a spiced latte.

428
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,460
I was just, I was going to say sugar cake.

429
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
I'll be spice cake.

430
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
Okay.

431
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,660
How about spiced rum?

432
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Yeah.

433
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
There you go.

434
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
I'll be spiced rum.

435
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,140
Sometimes your friends know you better than you know yourself.

436
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,180
Or I could be spicy snack.

437
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,180
There you go.

438
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,180
All right.

439
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,680
Who's in, who's in for our spice girls Guild.

440
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,460
Who's in a show of hands and chat.

441
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,460
Who's in, wow.

442
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Nobody's talking.

443
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,460
What's good.

444
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,460
Is there, are we broadcasting?

445
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,460
Hello.

446
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Hello.

447
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Okay.

448
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,700
So pod culture has to be, um, 11 herbs and spices.

449
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
That's right.

450
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,700
There will be a character named herb and come up with, and then there will be 11 herbs in

451
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,180
the Guild and then spices.

452
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Perfect.

453
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,180
It'd be in apostrophe spice.

454
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,140
All right.

455
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,820
Anyway, so yes, Dune is getting an MMO and now we're, we're going to make it ridiculous,

456
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,900
which again, video games can be stupid.

457
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,580
Lululemon is not fucking designer and you misspelled Chanel.

458
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,580
I'm just saying.

459
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,100
Levi's is also not designer.

460
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,380
I'm just saying.

461
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,860
You only, you only have a couple on there that are actually, and honestly, for, uh,

462
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:01,940
for Cruella, I got a little bit more from Sharperelli and maybe a hint of Valentino.

463
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,940
So just saying.

464
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,940
Okay.

465
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,420
This is a gaming podcast once in a while.

466
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,220
All right.

467
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
What else?

468
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:17,740
Hey, Hey, Sailor Moon's outfits in the anime were all based off of lots of fashion design

469
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,180
at the time in the nineties.

470
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,740
Let's talk about Sailor Moon for a minute.

471
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,940
And I had it.

472
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
No, I will leave.

473
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,580
I will leave all the talk about Sabin Sailor Moon to the experts at anime jam session.

474
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,540
So Dan and I actually talked about that this morning, just a little tangent.

475
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:44,620
I woke up this morning and I hear the Jason, the wield warriors theme song, and Dan was

476
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,980
on a kick of listening to eighties cartoon theme songs.

477
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,900
And we listened to pole position and, uh, the mysterious cities of gold.

478
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,540
And we're like, you know what, we can't enjoy this show anymore now that we're adults and

479
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
no history.

480
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:09,460
Um, but it was just like, and somehow we got on the topic of Sabin doing, uh, uh, um, the

481
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,700
Sailor Moon and we like, we're like, wasn't it Deke that did it?

482
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
Wasn't Sabin involved with Deke?

483
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
Was blah, blah, blah.

484
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
And went back and forth.

485
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,740
And that was like our whole discussion this morning whilst listening to the kid video

486
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,740
theme song.

487
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,340
Oh, you want a tangent?

488
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,340
You want a tangent honey?

489
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
One more.

490
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,340
I got a tangent for you.

491
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
Okay.

492
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
One more.

493
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,340
And then you can take the tangent.

494
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,340
All right.

495
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:35,380
So, um, in talking, uh, crap.

496
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,300
Now I forgot what I was going to say Bionic six was nineties.

497
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
Wasn't it?

498
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,620
Um, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

499
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,460
I was going to say something about it now and I just, thanks, Rob.

500
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
I'm sorry.

501
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,460
Okay.

502
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,780
Do I, do I, do I get to do my piece now?

503
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,780
Fine.

504
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,500
And if I remember it halfway through what you're saying, I'll repeat it.

505
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Okay.

506
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,220
So all aboard the tangent train, Rob Roberts conducting choo choo.

507
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
Here we go.

508
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,220
Okay.

509
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,500
So you were talking about eighties cartoons earlier this week, I got into a Twitter fight

510
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,220
with the County of Sacramento.

511
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,700
Yes, that is exactly what happened.

512
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,440
I got into a Twitter fight with the County of Sacramento, where we live.

513
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,660
And let me tell you a little bit about this fight.

514
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
Okay.

515
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
Here's what happened during this fight.

516
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:30,260
So I had a heart attack because they pushed an alert to everybody in Sacramento County

517
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:36,820
with this horrible noise, like the emergency alert noise, which I call the brown note.

518
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,980
I call the brown note because it makes you poop because it makes you sound like a tornado

519
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,260
is going off somewhere.

520
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,260
Okay.

521
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,260
Hold, I promised a tangent train.

522
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,620
I'm giving you a tangent train.

523
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:51,260
So I tweet and I say this fricking, I said the heart attack I just had with both my phones

524
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,180
making that hideous noise in unison, thanks a lot for the heads up.

525
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,700
And then I realized right after I wrote that, oh, I guess on their Twitter account, they

526
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,420
did give a heads up.

527
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,460
And then look at me being dragged and exposed by the County, that literally the County tweets

528
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:12,640
at me, give us a follow and avoid inconvenience in the future with the upside down smile emoji.

529
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,900
And so I, as, as one does, I replied with, I just write, I replied, drag me because I

530
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,980
drag me, expose me, make me write bad checks because that's drag.

531
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,860
I would have put drag me mommy, but I didn't want to assume the County's gender.

532
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,020
So I just put drag me.

533
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,020
Okay.

534
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,020
Cause that's, that's what I deserved.

535
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,020
All right.

536
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,020
So they replied-

537
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,020
I heard the light.

538
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,980
I heard it as eat me, beat me, make me write bad checks.

539
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,660
They replied with a GIF of Lilo and Stitch and Stitch getting dragged.

540
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:49,380
Travis Donovan from understation live jumps in and says, come on, Rob, I live 1,700 miles

541
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,380
away.

542
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,780
And even I knew it was coming with a GIF of GI Joe saying, knowing is half the battle

543
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,660
to which here we go tangent train about to reach his destination.

544
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,900
I replied saying, I never learned that lesson.

545
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,860
I was too busy watching Jem and the Holograms.

546
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,740
I want to point out who likes this tweet.

547
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,180
And I remember what I was going to say.

548
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,740
Who likes this tweet?

549
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,740
The County of Sacramento.

550
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Okay.

551
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,580
So now I remember what I was going to say.

552
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,960
While we were listening, Dan had played the kid video thing, except it was like all instrumental.

553
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,140
So we were doing all of the lines back and forth from the other room.

554
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,060
We still remembered how the whole introduction to that show went.

555
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,060
That's not as funny as what you said, but it was a return.

556
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
No, it's fine.

557
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,700
Once you start a story, you have to finish it.

558
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,860
It's the rules of a party.

559
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,540
It is the rules.

560
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,820
Going to the chat, Tigerclaw in chat says, I guess that means they are Jem fans.

561
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,060
Well, Tigerclaw, anyone with taste would be.

562
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,860
She was just simply, she was just truly outrageous.

563
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,020
Truly, truly, truly outrageous.

564
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,900
And then Darktitsia says, I'm sorry.

565
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,180
That was totally worth retelling, right?

566
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,540
I want to give a big shout out again to everybody listening to OLR for the very first time.

567
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:11,300
Thanks to Dragon Con and the video game track panels I may have been moderating at the show.

568
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,300
Welcome to your video game three hour podcast.

569
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,820
And you might, you might've asked yourself before hitting subscribe, how, how do they

570
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,660
talk about video games for three hours on a podcast?

571
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,660
Gotcha bitch.

572
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,660
Okay.

573
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,660
Where were we?

574
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,660
Oh, yes.

575
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:35,660
Do you want to know how tangenty my brain works just for the record?

576
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,780
When y'all were talking about Tom Hanks, I had it in my head that he was in a movie about

577
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,780
a guy who is made socially invisible.

578
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,220
And it turned out it wasn't Tom Hanks in it at all, but I remember it being Tom Hanks.

579
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
It was some different guy.

580
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,820
And it was an episode of the Twilight Zone.

581
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:56,300
Like from God, the eighties or nineties, and it was called, uh, uh, to see the invisible

582
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,300
man.

583
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,660
I can't breathe.

584
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
Yeah.

585
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:05,620
I just went and looked all of that up while you were talking about Tom Hanks movies, because

586
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,860
that's where my brain went.

587
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:18,620
And if anybody has seen that episode of Twilight Zone, talk to me, I'm done.

588
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,620
What else is doing this?

589
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,340
The game's called Loki.

590
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,740
Um, well, Hammer, Return of the Monkey Island.

591
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,140
They had some more footage of that, including, uh, Dan.

592
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
I love Stan.

593
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
Stan's great.

594
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,860
They should make a whole game with Stan in it, but like, you know, I'll take this.

595
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,860
Um,

596
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,860
Hey, Loki.

597
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,860
What about recreation?

598
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,860
Recreation?

599
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
Yeah.

600
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:46,700
It's, uh, an open world racing game that lets you do like burnout shit.

601
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
Oh yeah.

602
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,700
That looks good.

603
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
W.R.E.T.

604
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
C.K.

605
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,700
Reation.

606
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,540
Oh, um, I don't remember that one, but yeah, that sounds cool.

607
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,940
I think we talked about that though.

608
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,260
Like a game called dredge.

609
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,740
And I wondered if, you know, the main character hidden lockers.

610
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,380
It might also be something that like, she's citing from like the floor at gamescom that

611
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
people are playing.

612
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,660
And that wasn't an opening night live.

613
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,660
Yeah.

614
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,660
I think it wasn't recreation.

615
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,580
The one that was like the old, uh, burnout devs and stuff like that.

616
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,580
I think it is them.

617
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Yeah.

618
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
Yeah.

619
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,460
Cause I would have remembered that.

620
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,860
Um, but what else, uh, goat simulator three had a gameplay trailer.

621
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,860
Looks awesome.

622
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,860
Can't wait.

623
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:31,380
Um, they had, I think, uh, the outlast trials, uh, which is going to have a closed beta in

624
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,380
October.

625
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,380
Um, what is it?

626
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:40,900
A new trailer for Gotham nights, which would be out a little bit in October 21st.

627
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,460
Um, dying light two has some DLC coming that they showed off that kind of looked like thunder

628
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,460
dome.

629
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,460
So that's kind of neat.

630
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,340
Um, what else?

631
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:58,140
Um, I'm trying to think there was friends versus friends.

632
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,580
Oh, everywhere that looked interesting.

633
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:08,380
Like some sort of space survival game, um, more, uh, the Callisto protocol, I love all

634
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,380
the violence there and they, they always end it with the player getting killed in some

635
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,380
brutal way.

636
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,820
I love those that in the trailers, um, they have a telltale series for the expanse.

637
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,340
Oh yeah.

638
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,220
I have some friends that don't talk about gaming a lot, but like, well actually it's

639
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,220
my Ingers friends.

640
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,860
So they took, they do talk about that game, but they don't talk about like console games

641
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,580
a lot or PC games.

642
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,140
But there was a few of them that saw that expanse tell, and they were like, Oh, I'm

643
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,140
all about this.

644
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,620
Cause they, they love the show.

645
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,620
Yeah.

646
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:45,460
Uh, and then speaking of old telltale games, there is the new tales of the borderlands,

647
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:52,220
uh, or new tales from the borderlands, which cool.

648
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,180
Like it's neat.

649
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
I mean, I don't know.

650
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,420
I never played the original and kind of over board lands of it, but cool though.

651
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,420
Cause I,

652
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,580
but it was one of the better telltale games, believe it or not.

653
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,220
It was pretty good.

654
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Yeah.

655
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,020
Uh, so that, that was neat, I guess.

656
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,660
And then what else, uh, I don't know.

657
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,660
There's a lot of other trailers.

658
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:19,780
So like, I know, like, um, they mentioned that Atlas fallen, which looks interesting.

659
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:25,340
It also kind of souls, like looking, uh, friends versus friends, which I'm not really sure

660
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,860
what that's supposed to be like, but just like a FPS cartoony looking game, uh, Lords

661
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,860
of fallen.

662
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,220
They have, uh, they're rebooting the hat, which I don't remember what that game was

663
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,220
like.

664
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,460
I don't think it's that old either that get the original came out in 2014.

665
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:49,300
So about the time they announced that I went to originally, yeah, pretty much a new pirate

666
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
game.

667
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,980
Tortuga, the pirate's tail or a pirate's tail.

668
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,980
I'm sorry.

669
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,780
I just realized that boss name in the mega man game playing behind you is creamery man.

670
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,020
I'm like, they're, they're really having to stretch for some new days.

671
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
Aren't they?

672
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,820
There's a lot of like interesting bosses.

673
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,060
I guess they probably tried to do creamy man and realize that probably is not the name

674
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,180
they should pick.

675
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,320
So they had to, it's all ice cream flavor or no, I guess it's very much like an ice

676
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,780
cream parlor type of thing, robot thing, but it's just, it's interesting how they decided

677
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:30,980
creamery man because creamy man might've, might've read wrong ice cream man, but yeah.

678
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,980
Anyway.

679
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
All right.

680
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
Gamescom.

681
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:39,920
And then of course the Pokemon car, you know, Pokemon car.

682
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Because why not?

683
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Why not?

684
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,960
We just talked about a car you're never going to own last week on the show.

685
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,460
Why not throw another one in?

686
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,460
Yeah.

687
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,460
Yeah.

688
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,460
All right.

689
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,460
Enough about gamescom.

690
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,460
I'm sure we will touch on more of these highlights as we move on throughout the show.

691
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,700
I will mention some comments from chat, uh, fifth dream talking about the Pokemon car

692
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,940
says I want that car.

693
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
Someone buy it for me.

694
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,340
Uh, SG100Matt says high on life.

695
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,900
The FPS from the minds of Rick and Morty creators talking weapons showed some gameplay.

696
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,020
This'll either be the most obnoxious game or quickly forgotten.

697
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,660
I'm strangely intrigued by it though.

698
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,540
So all right.

699
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,540
Pixel Pacas in chat says they call ice cream creameries in Vermont.

700
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,900
I mean, I've heard that used before.

701
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
Cold stone creamery.

702
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,900
Yeah.

703
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Cold stone creamery is the thing.

704
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Yeah.

705
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,660
And, and, uh, as a, who was it?

706
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,540
Evan back in the day would say leather boys.

707
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,500
Well, that's, that's very niche to NorCal too.

708
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,500
It's yeah.

709
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Yeah.

710
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,900
Cause I say the first time I went back East, somebody was like, do you want to go to friendlies?

711
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,900
I was like, what's that?

712
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,260
That and they're like, it's, it's ice cream.

713
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
I'm like, what?

714
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
I've never heard it.

715
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,260
Cause I guess, you know, it's a huge thing.

716
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Yeah.

717
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
Yeah.

718
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
They have one in the Bay area.

719
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
I thought that was the Bay area one.

720
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
No, no, no.

721
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
There was a different place.

722
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,700
No friendlies is like only like back East.

723
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,260
I'd never seen them here.

724
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Yeah.

725
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
So anyway.

726
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
All right.

727
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,300
Jamie, Jamie, have you heard of a game called dinkum?

728
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,820
I don't know if it's on Mac yet.

729
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,780
I know it's on PC, but it's basically like animal crossing.

730
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,380
If we were to strip out the,

731
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:21,420
Yeah, I have heard of that, but it's not, it's like you're out living in the Outback

732
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
or something.

733
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,420
Kind of.

734
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,420
Yes.

735
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,420
Yes.

736
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,420
It is Australian.

737
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,420
All right.

738
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,500
Well, I want to get to our gaming weeks because I know dark soccer has been playing another

739
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,580
game that some have called the animal crossing inspired, but it's nothing animal crossing.

740
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,580
All right.

741
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,580
Yeah.

742
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,420
That was kind of what I got out of it too, but dark soccer wants to tell us about your

743
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,060
gaming week.

744
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,700
So I will start with the usuals.

745
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:52,460
I been playing final fantasy for, I just lost the twins last night, sad face.

746
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:58,820
Of course, dead by daylight, working through, trying to get my blood points saved up.

747
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,420
In fact, I need to actually just start holding onto them for the 30th for when I dish out

748
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:11,820
money for cosmetics and DLC for resident evil project W where we get Wesker as the bad guy,

749
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:18,540
which did I not say Wesker was going to be the killer on the last resident evil patch.

750
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,940
Remember I said that.

751
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,740
Well, yeah, I mean, there's only so many choices.

752
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,740
Yeah.

753
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:30,460
I knew it was either going to be him tyrant or, um, or nemesis.

754
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,940
And people were saying, Oh no, it's going to be, uh, Alexia code Veronica, blah, blah,

755
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,940
blah.

756
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
I'm like, no.

757
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,340
Um, but I knew it was going to be Wesker and Wesker did come out.

758
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,340
And so I was right.

759
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:47,380
And I called that shit and now we're getting Ada, Shiva, um, Carlos and Rebecca.

760
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,860
So I'm really, I'm really just jazzed about that.

761
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:56,100
Um, but I also played cult of the lamb.

762
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,820
I was going to stream for three hours that night.

763
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:05,180
I streamed for five, five hours.

764
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,900
I stopped at two 30 in the fucking morning.

765
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,020
It's addictive.

766
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:17,380
You don't say I'm not super great at the combat just because, you know, my, my wrist hurt.

767
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,500
I am playing on the controller.

768
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:24,540
It's actually really easy on a controller, but, um, it's so fun because like your fucking

769
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,780
people are demanding.

770
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,460
And um, I didn't have too many people, uh, watching while I was playing it just, you

771
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:37,640
know, in and out, but, uh, Finaro was my, uh, first cultist and her cultist ended up

772
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,940
like hating me and leaving.

773
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:48,460
Oh, so, uh, I will be playing this tomorrow night after, after work at eight Pacific time.

774
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:54,340
And I would love it if listeners would come in and be cultists.

775
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,100
You're literally asking the listeners to join your cult.

776
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,040
I'm asking the listeners to join my cult.

777
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:06,720
My cult is called the fantasy zone because of course it is, um, but I, um, I've got to

778
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,880
do a lot more just like farming for myself in the game so that I can get enough hearts

779
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,940
and whatnot to go fight the boss of the second stage.

780
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,200
So I'm getting into it.

781
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,800
I'm trying to get my people happy.

782
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,400
We already have the sacrifice, your cultists, um, we have the feast, we have a funeral.

783
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,440
My favorite is sacrificing somebody.

784
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Okay.

785
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,400
So you come out and everyone's like, put those on their hoods and everything.

786
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,160
When you're in, you give your sermon, you do all that.

787
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,360
And then you do a ritual, which if you do sacrifice, they all, uh, throw on these hoods

788
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,960
and you don't know who it is.

789
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,960
And then when you pick the person, they throw off their hood with a big old grin on their

790
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,360
face and everyone's like, yay, stab.

791
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,880
And they're like, yay.

792
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:04,360
It might be like that South Park episode, Oh God, Woodling Critter, Christmas type thing.

793
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,520
I absolutely love it.

794
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:16,200
And um, and I actually managed to get into my Dead by Daylight account on Steam and all

795
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:24,120
of my, uh, progress that I made on, um, on Stadia, like my achievements there, none of

796
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:31,960
them came over, except for like the, the P 50 one did before.

797
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:40,520
Um, and my level ones, but I, I fully thought that all of my achievements from Stadia would

798
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
carry over.

799
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,280
Cosmetics did, oddly enough, my, my, while my eerie shards and my blood points carried

800
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,480
over my RX cells did not.

801
00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:00,380
So I will be staying on Stadia for the foreseeable future, but the way that I accessed it was

802
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,480
through, um, the Nvidia thing.

803
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,240
I have to say it does not look good through Nvidia.

804
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,560
It does not it's, it's fuzzy and a little pixely whereas, I mean, and again, it could

805
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:25,480
be a thing because I'm on Stadia pro, but my, my graphics on Stadia pro are like ultra

806
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
and it's beautiful.

807
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
So interesting.

808
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Yeah.

809
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
So there's, there's that.

810
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Um, so, okay.

811
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
All right.

812
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:38,960
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, I will toss it over to Loki.

813
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
How was your gaming week?

814
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,400
Well, I played things other than Minecraft.

815
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
You did it.

816
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Oh yeah.

817
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Oh yes.

818
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Oh yes.

819
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,600
I've been waiting all week to ask you about a particular game that came out this week

820
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
because I've seen the tweets.

821
00:41:52,600 --> 00:42:00,760
So I, I, I played, uh, when I played Minecraft, I played, um, some fashion police squad, um,

822
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,840
in the process of debugging stuff from the other game, which I played, which was saints

823
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
row.

824
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,640
So it hasn't been good.

825
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:20,680
Um, the saints row, like if you've seen any of the reviews, it's an incredibly buggy and

826
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,760
under polished game.

827
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,980
It's just, it's really bad.

828
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,060
Like to a point where it's not, not like funny, bad.

829
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,480
It's like bad, broken, bad.

830
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,360
And so that aside, because I haven't, didn't really hit any tech, my heart, one technical

831
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,440
hurdle I hit was that trying to play the game with my wireless controller.

832
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,280
Um, the controls aren't mapped correctly.

833
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,120
So not that like it wasn't mapped correctly.

834
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:54,280
Like I had the re configure my controller that the button prompts were incorrect.

835
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,800
So it read, you know, like I was pushing the a button and read that as the B button B was

836
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:07,320
X, X was a, um, the directional, the analog stick was the wrong analog stick and it was

837
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,320
inversed.

838
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,480
Um, the right trigger was start.

839
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,200
So it was all fucked up, basically, um, plugging it in, solve that problem and fixed it now,

840
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,880
which I don't understand.

841
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,920
If I go into steam with a wireless controller, it plays just fine.

842
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,160
It doesn't give a crap if it's plugged in or wireless because it's a competent piece

843
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,280
of software, saints rose, fucking bullshit, but the technical stuff aside, let's talk

844
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,120
about the writing.

845
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:43,240
They have somehow by like some sheer ineptitude, have found a way to make you actually hate

846
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,720
your main character.

847
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,320
Like you see your main character acting out stuff in the thing.

848
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,520
It's like, Holy shit, I hate this person and this is the person that I'm playing it.

849
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,240
I don't want to play as this person because this person is a fucking idiot.

850
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,920
And so that, that is the start of the, the game itself.

851
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,800
Not to mention that the gameplay is kind of meh as it is.

852
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,240
I actually, this game made me like Saints Row 4 better and Saints Row 4 wasn't great.

853
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,360
I mean, like, it's just, it's so awful.

854
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,720
Like the characters are so goddamn awful.

855
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,960
I don't like any of them.

856
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,080
I hate all of them.

857
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:22,080
It hasn't gotten any better since they initially showed them they are awful characters.

858
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,660
They are not the saints.

859
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,760
I don't give a shit if this is a reboot and they're forming the saints.

860
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,440
They're fucking idiots.

861
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,400
You reject, you reject this game.

862
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,560
They're seriously idiots.

863
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,640
Let's talk about the original Saints Row.

864
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,840
It's the original Saints Row they were gang bangers.

865
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:40,840
Like each person in the gang, like was,

866
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,360
they have their own personalities, but they were ruthless people.

867
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,680
They were just like, you know what?

868
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,240
I don't take shit from anybody.

869
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,320
And that's what it was.

870
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,240
That's what the game's supposed to make you feel like.

871
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,240
Like, I don't take shit from anybody.

872
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm going to go fuck these other gangs up.

873
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,320
That's how you're supposed to feel playing Saints Row.

874
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,520
This shit is fucking awful.

875
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,520
It's just like, oh, oh, we don't have enough money to make our rent.

876
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,240
Oh, well, let's go knock off a payday loans place.

877
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,000
Okay, cool.

878
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,040
Now we could go buy, I want to buy a $300 waffle maker.

879
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,600
Cause I really like waffles.

880
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,480
Waffles are pretty good, Loki.

881
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,240
What the fuck is this shit?

882
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,960
Like it's so stupid.

883
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,080
So I was going to ask you,

884
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,640
and you're already kind of answering this,

885
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,160
cause I was going to ask you, where did this game go wrong?

886
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,720
What was the misstep they made along the way?

887
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,760
And it really sounds like you're kind of saying is that this whole idea to make like the,

888
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,520
the, the tone of the game different is just like, it's just, it's, it's wrong from the start.

889
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,520
It's what it is.

890
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:46,440
What it is is that they're just trying to inject like modern day, like kind of scenarios, I guess,

891
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,080
into it sort of like where it's like, okay, hey, capitalism is bad and we're in a recession.

892
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, I was gonna say, I was gonna say modern day DLC techniques is what they're injecting into it.

893
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,120
Oh, oh, oh no, hold on.

894
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,120
Hold on.

895
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,120
Yeah.

896
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,120
Yes.

897
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,120
There is some bullshit.

898
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,120
Okay.

899
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,320
So there's, there's some jokes that they try to pull off in this game.

900
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,200
Jokes that are just like, take a look in the mirror.

901
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,200
You fucking idiot.

902
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,320
It's like, seriously, they have a joke about like DLC that, Oh, Hey, Oh yeah.

903
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,440
That piece of armor is going to cost two 99.

904
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,120
They're like, ha ha ha funny.

905
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,440
Cause DLC is like a thing.

906
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,640
Have you looked at your previous games?

907
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,200
They were so fucking ridden with DLC.

908
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,360
It was ridiculous.

909
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,920
Like all of the Cosmex were nickel and dive.

910
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,840
Go on steam right now and go buy their fucking game and see how much fucking DLC there was

911
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,840
for it.

912
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:44,740
It is so goddamn stupid that they would even try to, why even try to poke fun at that?

913
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,200
And then on top of all that, then they make the fucking joke of like the Todd Howard,

914
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,600
it just works bullshit.

915
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,600
Yeah.

916
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,440
Like you should fucking talk with your bug free fucking game.

917
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,200
Like God forbid, but that's at least has a fucking entertaining game after all of those

918
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
fucking bugs.

919
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,440
But you, all you have is fucking shitty ass saints were reboot is what you got.

920
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,100
And what's that going to fucking give you?

921
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,960
No one gets a shit about your game and all your fucking like, Oh, we've heard the feedback

922
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,960
in summer.

923
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,960
You are having problems.

924
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
Bullshit.

925
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,960
No.

926
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,960
Some of us are having problems.

927
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,200
Everybody's fucking having problems with your broken ass piece of shit game that we've told

928
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,040
you from the outset is going to be shit because of the, your fucking characters that nobody

929
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,040
liked.

930
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,040
And did you fucking listen?

931
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,040
Cause you didn't fucking listen.

932
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,600
Now you have fucking ugly Sonic running up in this shit.

933
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,280
And then you're wondering why no one wants to fucking watch your goddamn movie.

934
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,280
That's wise.

935
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,000
Cause you didn't fucking listen to those stupid fans.

936
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,960
Who were the people who are going to buy your goddamn game in the first place?

937
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,560
Who are you going to fucking sell this to?

938
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,560
People have never heard of fucking saints row.

939
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,400
You're you're targeting it towards people that are going to buy the franchise.

940
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,420
Like you got to make it appeal to the people that play the old game.

941
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,760
And I get it that it's too fucking sensitive.

942
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,160
Now they have fucking strippers and big dicks fucking running around.

943
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,280
You know what?

944
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,480
It's a fucking game.

945
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,280
And you know, sometimes it's fine to be a little bit offensive about that shit.

946
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,960
Like get over your fucking self with your stupid ass game.

947
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,960
That's it.

948
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,440
I got to try to play a little bit longer and to least give it a chance, but it's awful.

949
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,440
It's really awful.

950
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,440
I don't want to play it anymore.

951
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,840
That fashion police spot said, seriously, that game is a fucking fantastic.

952
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,760
I can't wait to play after the show.

953
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,920
I am not going to play that game.

954
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,260
Like seriously is just, it is so disappointing.

955
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,020
Like I am so fucking disappointed with this shit.

956
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,520
Like so long we wanted a new saints row game.

957
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,040
And this is the fucking shit that they pull out and the fucking nerve of them just to

958
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,960
think that like, let's be honest, their writing has not been good.

959
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,960
Okay.

960
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
They killed off Gat in the third game.

961
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,120
They thought that was fucking genius writing of them and then everybody was fucking pissed

962
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,120
off at them.

963
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,240
They were fucking pissed off.

964
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,200
So they, Oh, he didn't die.

965
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,040
He got abducted by aliens.

966
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,520
That was the plan all along bull fucking shit.

967
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,760
It was the plan you fucked up and you had the retcon that shit.

968
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,980
So you know what you fucking need retcon all of this shit.

969
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,680
This game does not fucking exist.

970
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,680
Okay.

971
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,680
That's how it is.

972
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,200
You could have made a whole reboot with the original characters and it would have been

973
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:09,300
fucking in Canon because that was one of the endings in got out of hell.

974
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,660
You could have made a new game.

975
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,980
You don't ask Jamie Lee Curtis.

976
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:17,100
You don't have to explain if you just want to go back and do a new sequel.

977
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,380
If you're Jamie Lee Curtis, you don't owe anybody a fucking thing.

978
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,980
You don't owe anyone an explanation.

979
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:23,980
And you know what?

980
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,640
You will be number one at the box office.

981
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,160
So you can, yeah, you could just pull a fucking final fantasy seven reboot thing.

982
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,380
Like you have the same characters, but different shit can go down.

983
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,580
That's all you have to fucking do.

984
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:39,460
Like it's not a hard thing to do volition, but you know, because of this, we're never

985
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,460
going to get a fucking Saints Row game again.

986
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,460
That's why you're mad.

987
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,460
This is so bad.

988
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,300
It's a franchise killer because, because they fuck this shit up.

989
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,020
They fuck this shit up so much.

990
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:53,700
So often, like they tried the spinoff was an agents of mayhem or whatever that bullshit

991
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,700
was.

992
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,760
And then nobody wanted to play it because it wasn't a Saints Row game.

993
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,280
So then they are all, Oh, Hey, here's some, we're going to put Johnny Gad in it now.

994
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,280
Just like this one.

995
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,900
They're like, Oh, it doesn't tie in with the original saints at all, but Oh, but you can

996
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,160
buy a Johnny Gad shirt.

997
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,160
Fuck them.

998
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,360
I'm so sick of their shit.

999
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,860
That's it.

1000
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,360
We're done.

1001
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:19,660
But other than that, Loki, how was the play anyway?

1002
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,920
Yeah, but fashion police squad is awesome.

1003
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,460
It's a great, like quick, like, or not quickly, I guess it's sort of like quake.

1004
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:30,220
It's pretty fast paced and stuff and it's, it's silly and it's got like a, it's got a

1005
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,740
lot of humor in it and I really think it's worth the play, but yeah, I say it's row.

1006
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:39,140
If you really are interested in it, just wait for a deep discount and wait for a long time

1007
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,900
because it's going to take them a ton of time to patch this stuff.

1008
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,660
It'll be free on the Epic game store in a year.

1009
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,220
It's, it's so unacceptable in the, in the state that it is right now.

1010
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:51,660
It is just absolutely awful.

1011
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,980
Like even people have reviewed it on console and stuff.

1012
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:58,060
They said it's crashed a console like numerous times just trying to play this game.

1013
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,100
Like it shouldn't be this bad.

1014
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,540
Like technically is just all messed up and they clearly rushed it out.

1015
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,100
Uh, bonds, double a six and chat says Loki woke up and chose scorched earth.

1016
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,100
Yep.

1017
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,620
You know, sometimes, sometimes you're really disappointed in a video game.

1018
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,620
All right.

1019
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,340
Uh, let's see my gaming week.

1020
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,460
I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed to follow that.

1021
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,340
Uh, I played more Final Fantasy 14, which got a new patch this week, uh, which, uh,

1022
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,340
extended the story.

1023
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,060
They've got a really cool new character in it and I'm really interested to see where

1024
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,060
they go with it.

1025
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,220
I really liked the new dungeon.

1026
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:34,100
I really, really liked the Final Fantasy four references because I'll just say it at this

1027
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,100
point.

1028
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,900
If you're a Final Fantasy 14 fan, you've already played it at this point.

1029
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,540
Um, it is now obvious we are fighting the four fiends, uh, in this con because we have

1030
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,740
now fought in this, uh, patch.

1031
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:48,980
You fight two of them, uh, you fight Scarmiglione and you fight, uh, Barbariccia.

1032
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,940
So, uh, Barbariccia is the trial and it's, it's a good trial.

1033
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:56,340
So, uh, and the Scarmiglione is the dungeon boss and, uh, it's all done very well.

1034
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:02,220
So I can't wait for us to do, uh, Cogzano and, um, Rubicant, uh, Rubicant I'm sure will

1035
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,860
be the last one that they do because, you know, that's a, that's a huge, uh, uh, boss

1036
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,860
fight.

1037
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,340
I love that they're kind of like tying it.

1038
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,660
It's not directly Final Fantasy four, but it's like, I feel like it's like an alternate

1039
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,980
universe type of thing.

1040
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,900
Uh, and the story is great.

1041
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:20,240
And this patch gave us the Island Sanctuary expansion.

1042
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,060
So now they're, and they're calling it animal crossing mode.

1043
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,100
Mm, I wouldn't go to, I think they want to label anything that's like a farm sim animal

1044
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,100
crossing.

1045
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,700
I wouldn't call it that, but it is a nice relaxing little like gather and have critters

1046
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,500
and veg and plants.

1047
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:40,340
And since it's, and they built it kind of smart so that you can't just hammer it all

1048
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,620
out in a night.

1049
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,620
People tried.

1050
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:48,820
I mean, I guess you can, if you're really, really dedicated, but I think the developers

1051
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,140
are trying to make it very clear.

1052
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,140
There's no need to be.

1053
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,340
Um, so, uh, yeah, I, I like what they've done with the Island Sanctuary.

1054
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:59,660
I think it's a pretty cool little feature, um, other games I've played this week.

1055
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:06,780
I played, um, Diablo three this weekend, a lot, a lot, um, what's that you and Alan

1056
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,780
playing together?

1057
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,780
Yep.

1058
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,180
Alan, I've been playing, I, I helped power level him.

1059
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:18,100
So uh, yeah, we've been playing, uh, I, uh, I'm up to about Paragon 150 now.

1060
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,140
So and that's the season started on Friday.

1061
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,260
So I've been playing a lot.

1062
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:28,740
I tried to play Pokemon go yesterday because, uh, yesterday was the big finale of Pokemon

1063
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,220
go Fest and I was all jazzed to do it.

1064
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,860
I went downtown and I started what, but it was too hot.

1065
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,820
It was too hot.

1066
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:40,020
And it's not the degree, like it was a hundred degree day.

1067
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:45,060
We've had worse, but it's just the sun bearing down on you while you're trying to walk around

1068
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,820
and find groups to raid with and stuff was just too much.

1069
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:54,180
I didn't realize you could get these new, uh, wild beasts, what the hell are they called?

1070
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,660
The wormhole, ultra beasts, whatever they are.

1071
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,660
Sorry.

1072
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,660
I forget all the names.

1073
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,660
I did not realize you could get them through quests.

1074
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,660
Thank you.

1075
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,660
Ultra beasts.

1076
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,780
I thought you had to raid for them.

1077
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,000
And I was getting really irritated when I was joining raids and like, no one else is

1078
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
in the area doing it.

1079
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,940
I'm like, Oh my God, I'm going to be stuck out here.

1080
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,820
But then I found out, Oh, you get them.

1081
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,820
Thanks to S.J.

1082
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,820
100 Matt sending me a tweet.

1083
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,240
He's like, Oh no, you'll get them through the quests.

1084
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,240
Don't stress about it.

1085
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,340
I was like, Oh, Oh, okay.

1086
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,220
Well I guess I could have done this whole thing in my car or I could have gone to the

1087
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,660
mall that's indoors.

1088
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:30,680
But at that point I was like, eh, I want to just play Diablo.

1089
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,680
So I got three shinies, three, but I got the unknown I needed that I didn't have yet.

1090
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,820
I think X and P were the new letters for me.

1091
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,460
And I got those and I was happy with that to be honest.

1092
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,340
So that's fine.

1093
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,780
I had a, I had an okay day.

1094
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,540
I got a shiny carob blast.

1095
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,700
Is that the name?

1096
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,980
It's instead of a dark blue, it's like an Aqua color, which I really like.

1097
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,080
And I got the shiny costume Pikachu.

1098
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,320
And those are usually pretty rare because they're only available for like a day or two.

1099
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,460
So that was, that was cool.

1100
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:04,160
So that was pretty much my gaming week.

1101
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,220
That's that's, that's really, that's really it.

1102
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,020
There was some other stuff too, but yeah, I'll, I'll talk about it another time.

1103
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:15,500
So why don't we get into housekeeping real quick?

1104
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,780
No show next week.

1105
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,780
I'm not here.

1106
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,780
I'm going to be at Dragon Con.

1107
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,780
I've said that a million times.

1108
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,220
I'm not going to go over my schedule again.

1109
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:25,300
You can check out last week's show or look for me in the app, Rob Roberts.

1110
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,860
I have three panels on video gaming, two on digital media, one on the horror tracks.

1111
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,660
I have six panels in all this year.

1112
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,120
And if you're going to be in the area, I'd love to meet people that listen to the show.

1113
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,960
I've had people come up to me after a panel and say, I've been listening for years and

1114
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,060
I just wanted to say hi.

1115
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:43,100
And that that's such a compliment and I really appreciate it.

1116
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:48,780
So please, yeah, if you're going to be at Dragon Con, please don't hesitate to say hi.

1117
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,500
And yeah, that's, that's everything I can think of at the moment.

1118
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,020
So we won't be here live, but we'll be back in two weeks.

1119
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,740
But I hope everybody has a fabulous Labor Day, uh, with whatever it is you're going

1120
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,740
to be doing this weekend.

1121
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,560
There's a lot of conventions going on here, here locally, SacAnime is always a thing that

1122
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,560
weekend.

1123
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,020
Um, what else is Labor Day weekend?

1124
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:13,140
There's another big convention I'm, is PAX, PAX, hello, PAX West is this weekend, right?

1125
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:16,860
So that's, that's the other big thing I was like, what is the other big thing on Labor

1126
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,980
Day that I always, oh yeah, it's PAX.

1127
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,400
So that's happening.

1128
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,820
So that'll be fun too.

1129
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,260
All right, uh, let's move on.

1130
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,180
Let's get into some gaming news and talk about some other video games stuff that's been going

1131
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,740
on around the globe.

1132
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,380
Loki, we'll start with you.

1133
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:34,980
Our Discord's been chatting about this one over at vog network.com slash Discord.

1134
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,740
Our Orange House Radio chat has been going off on this.

1135
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,800
So much shocking turn of events.

1136
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,660
Sony has decided to raise the price of the PlayStation 5, taking a, taking a page out

1137
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,820
of the meta book there.

1138
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:54,080
Um, they have said that challenging economic conditions, um, have cost the component prices

1139
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,080
that go up.

1140
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:00,060
And so in sense, they're going to raise the price in most markets.

1141
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:03,660
The U S seems to be the only exception at the moment.

1142
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:09,740
Um, but right now, like for example, uh, the PlayStation 5 or the PlayStation 5 with disk

1143
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:16,460
drive in Lake Europe is going to be, uh, five 49 99 and the digital edition being four

1144
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,500
49 99.

1145
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:23,420
Um, in the EU, it's going up from 500 to five 50.

1146
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:34,140
Um, we have in Australia now seven 50 to 800 and even in Mexico, uh, going from, uh, looks

1147
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:45,740
like 14,999 or eight with the, uh, Blu-ray drive and 12,499, uh, for the digital edition.

1148
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:49,900
Mike, Mike Deft, who is in Mexico had a few things to say about this on Discord and it

1149
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,220
has a few more things to say in our chat right now.

1150
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,300
So it's not happy about it.

1151
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:01,380
And that means just to stress, uh, it is not going up in the U S this is pretty much all

1152
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,260
these other places, but not the U S.

1153
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,660
So interesting.

1154
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,780
It is interesting that they're doing that.

1155
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:13,500
Um, now Microsoft and Nintendo have said that they're not planning on, um, Raising prices

1156
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,820
at this time.

1157
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:19,140
So Microsoft came out and said, we're constantly evaluating our business to offer our fans

1158
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,880
great gaming options are okay.

1159
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,540
So basically they said that I don't want to read all the PR speak, but it's basically

1160
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,380
saying that the prices are going to stay the same.

1161
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:35,740
Um, and then for Nintendo, they're saying they're not considering a switch price increase.

1162
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,860
That's probably for the best.

1163
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,860
Yeah.

1164
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,860
I mean, it's fine.

1165
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:46,500
Like, I, I'm surprised that they're doing that, like, cause I don't think that they're

1166
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,940
selling a ton of consoles in the mile of money that they, they don't make any thought of

1167
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,580
those consoles anyways, but I don't think they're losing a ton either.

1168
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:58,340
I don't know, but we'll see how that works out for them.

1169
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,980
I guess they're thinking right now because the shortages, it's still going to be in high

1170
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,220
demand, but it's like, you know, hopefully they're not thinking, well, scalpers could

1171
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,220
get that kind of money.

1172
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:11,300
So let's see if we can get that kind of money.

1173
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,300
It's just going to make the scalpers bring it up even higher.

1174
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,300
Yeah.

1175
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:19,420
I, it doesn't that feel a little bit like what Disneyland's doing.

1176
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:24,140
Let's raise the price so high that only the really rich people come and we don't have

1177
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,100
pass holders anymore.

1178
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:31,500
Like I, I, it just feels a little bit like that to me in a way, but you got it.

1179
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,900
You got to cater to your whales is what you're probably thinking.

1180
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,900
I guess so.

1181
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:41,100
Well, I, uh, I shudder to see what this little device is going to cost, but we know that

1182
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:45,900
the PlayStation VR two is apparently going to launch in early 2023.

1183
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,940
Uh, that is all we got.

1184
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:53,820
And I think this came from a tweet, uh, that like, uh, PlayStation France or something

1185
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,220
kind of first put out there.

1186
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,060
Uh, we don't know, like anything else, we don't know price, we don't know the actual

1187
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,060
date or whatever.

1188
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:04,820
I would assume that they're going to get it out before the fiscal year is over.

1189
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,980
Cause usually when something is early 2023, especially a piece of hardware, that's what

1190
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,980
they're aiming for.

1191
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:15,540
Um, this would not be completely unhinged for new hardware to come out in the beginning

1192
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,540
of the year.

1193
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:21,660
Um, Nintendo changed that game when they released the switch, uh, in March, right.

1194
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:26,460
And, uh, showed that you don't have to release a new console, uh, around the holidays, technically

1195
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:32,480
the PS VR two is not a new console, but it might as well be, uh, you know, it's a, certainly

1196
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:39,060
a high cost expansion for an existing console, but, uh, I love original PlayStation VR for

1197
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,060
the PS four.

1198
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:44,460
Uh, so I'm totally all about, you know, if the right games are out, I will totally get

1199
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,020
a VR two for the PlayStation five.

1200
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:51,180
I don't know what game is the must have app for this right now.

1201
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,060
I'm sure they're going to port Beat Saber.

1202
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,060
No man's sky.

1203
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,060
We already know is getting ported.

1204
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:59,220
I'm well, actually would they port Beat Saber now?

1205
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,880
Cause didn't meta pick up the studio that has that.

1206
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,880
So maybe, I don't know.

1207
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,140
I think they'd be fools not to, but I guess that's maybe not such a sure thing.

1208
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:15,200
So I'll be very curious to see what must have games come out, but I guess that horizon spin-off

1209
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,200
looked kind of neat.

1210
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,380
I guess, I guess Sony's trying to do their own things in house.

1211
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,380
We'll see.

1212
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:28,020
So, uh, more to come on that, uh, Bobby Black Wolf clarifying in chat, meta said they would

1213
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:34,580
keep Beat Saber multi-platform well, you know, I don't doubt that, but I doubted a little

1214
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:40,940
bit from them because, you know, Microsoft kind of also has played the wishy-washy we're

1215
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,300
going to keep things multi-platform, but then, but not everything, you know, so they can

1216
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:50,580
always, my point is they can always go back on their word and there's really nothing that

1217
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:54,900
anybody can do about it, but I do think it's in their best interest to keep a multi-platform.

1218
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:02,340
Um, also meta sucks, but it sucks just a little bit less thanks to the changes they made where

1219
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,820
you finally don't have to have a Facebook account linked to your, uh, meta thing anymore.

1220
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,380
So that's kind of nice, I guess.

1221
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,380
Yeah.

1222
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:14,540
All right, let's move on a completely different topic, uh, Dark Sakura.

1223
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:20,700
So, um, yeah, I brought up some Resident Evil stuff earlier, but what I did not bring up

1224
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:26,260
was Resident Evil on Netflix, which honestly I had completely forgotten existed.

1225
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:31,940
Um, and apparently a lot of other people forgot it existed or didn't really care for it, um,

1226
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,420
because it's being canceled.

1227
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:40,060
From what I understand, most people that remembered it existed wishes, wishes they hadn't.

1228
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,140
Hmm.

1229
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:50,340
Well, um, it is, uh, there's not going to be a season two, even though there were thoughts

1230
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:56,700
that there could be something better that came from it, um, but at any rate, um, it's

1231
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,580
not getting a second season.

1232
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:01,780
The story wasn't very well suited.

1233
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,580
It didn't really follow very well.

1234
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:10,820
Um, it had some weird narrative framing for jumping between timelines.

1235
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:16,620
Um, yeah, they're, they're just, it's no.

1236
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:20,060
I mean, the actors in it were apparently really great.

1237
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:26,420
Um, but it just suffered from really bad writing and a convoluted plot.

1238
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:32,540
And let's, let's also not forget Netflix has a reputation of sorts for, um, renewing shows

1239
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:37,340
or not as the case may be to which a DJ on my S in chat is saying, bring back cowboy

1240
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:41,220
bebop, which of course, you know, that was another high profile cancellation after the

1241
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:45,580
first season that folks didn't, but I feel like more people liked that show than liked,

1242
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,580
uh, resident evil.

1243
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:51,940
I saw maybe one person that said something borderline positive about it.

1244
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:52,940
I didn't see it.

1245
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:55,740
So I've, I have no horse in the race.

1246
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:58,940
I was looking at the dude playing, uh, I guess it's supposed to be Chris.

1247
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:01,700
He looks kind of like bad cosplay.

1248
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,700
He's cute though.

1249
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,700
That's it.

1250
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:04,700
All right.

1251
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,740
Well, here's the thing though.

1252
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,020
They don't just remove it from the service.

1253
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,180
That's HBO max.

1254
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:14,640
So if you could still go back and watch the first season, if you are feeling some sort

1255
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,640
of way, enjoy.

1256
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,640
All right.

1257
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,620
I was looking to see what else they canceled.

1258
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:26,820
They canceled another life, archive 81, cooking with Paris, which honestly, uh, yeah, no cooking

1259
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:27,820
with Paris.

1260
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:28,820
Q force.

1261
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,900
Q force.

1262
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,540
Why did I not know about that?

1263
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,940
Well, oh, they canceled that.

1264
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,460
I heard it was actually funny.

1265
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,460
Yeah.

1266
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,660
It was all right.

1267
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:40,060
It also canceled raising Dion, the babysitter's club.

1268
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,620
Oh, now see raising Dion, I'm kind of disappointed.

1269
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,820
That actually was a decent series.

1270
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:51,300
And the midnight gospel, um, fill a nine and chat says HBO max is kind of a mess right

1271
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,300
now.

1272
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:57,820
Girl, don't get us started.

1273
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:00,260
Like H HBO max.

1274
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,300
So bold.

1275
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,380
They tried to cancel Sesame street.

1276
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:04,380
Okay.

1277
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:10,060
That's, that's the kind of pure, pure fuckery that's going on at HBO max right now.

1278
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,220
Now, look, I understand it.

1279
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,180
PBS owns Sesame street at the end of the day.

1280
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:15,940
It's a complicated arrangement.

1281
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:24,420
The whole, the whole fact that Sesame street would even be up for debate is sick in my

1282
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,420
opinion.

1283
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:31,700
But anyway, HBO max, she's a disaster.

1284
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,900
She is a hot mess.

1285
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,900
Anyway.

1286
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:35,900
Yeah.

1287
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:39,520
Bobby buckle says they did remove early versions of Sesame street.

1288
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,820
They are just deleting stuff from the service.

1289
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:42,820
That's the thing about Netflix.

1290
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:45,420
They'll cancel everything, but they'll still try to say, Oh, you should go back and watch

1291
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,420
resident evil.

1292
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:49,520
Just, you know, to inflate the ratings and spend the hours on the service.

1293
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,520
They don't just remember things.

1294
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,520
For some reason.

1295
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,520
Oh, for the record.

1296
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,360
Um, I might've mentioned this before, but like there had been some episode of Sesame

1297
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,080
street that had never been aired again.

1298
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,880
Now it's on, uh, YouTube.

1299
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:02,880
Which one is that?

1300
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,320
Uh, I, we were watching it the other day.

1301
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:11,900
I'll, I'll look it up and then I, the only one I've ever pulled up and watched on YouTube

1302
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,040
was the one where Mr. Hooper passed away.

1303
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:18,340
Um, which actually like in retrospect, you know, I remember seeing that as a kid, I think

1304
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:21,120
a lot of folks around our age kind of remember that from being younger.

1305
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,080
I think it was the one with Margaret Hamilton.

1306
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:27,560
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, interesting.

1307
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,080
It was, yeah.

1308
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:38,640
So it's the one, um, from 1976 and they found the episode and then someone put it up on,

1309
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,800
uh, on YouTube.

1310
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,640
Margaret Hamilton, the, uh, Wicked Witch of the West from the original, uh, yeah, she

1311
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,840
was also on Mr. Rogers because that, that clip is around YouTube as well.

1312
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:52,080
That one was great how she just puts on the outfit there to prove that she wasn't, you

1313
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,080
know, scary.

1314
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,080
Yeah.

1315
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,080
Interesting.

1316
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,080
All right.

1317
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:00,920
Anyway, I was going to say, um, but the Mr. Hooper thing, like in retrospect is so well

1318
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,920
done.

1319
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,820
Like you don't like really, I think, appreciate it until you're older, like how they handled

1320
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:09,600
such a sensitive subject with tact and dignity.

1321
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,080
So, um, yeah, I, I, I remember it.

1322
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,840
I still get verklempt watching it.

1323
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,480
It's really, um, yeah, anyway.

1324
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,760
Not to bring the show down, but you know, that, that is what HBO max is deleting.

1325
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,040
Let's just put out, let's just, let's just put it out there.

1326
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,040
All right.

1327
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,880
And by the way, I linked the episode for people in chat.

1328
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:33,820
It is Sesame street episode 847 from 1976.

1329
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:39,080
And then after you watch that, go and listen to the, the 12 song with the pinball theme

1330
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,800
because that, um, was an awesome, so watch any of that until tomorrow.

1331
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,800
Okay.

1332
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,800
Yeah.

1333
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,800
Right now.

1334
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,800
Right now you focus on us.

1335
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,800
Okay.

1336
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:53,720
Uh, moving on, uh, Loki, sorry, I've got like earthquake going on here.

1337
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,840
This I need to tighten the screws on this desk and we're just going to just fall apart

1338
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,840
one day.

1339
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:02,480
Cause it shakes so easy every time there's no, well, that would be me.

1340
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,480
All right.

1341
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,480
Uh, moving on.

1342
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,480
Loki, what do you have?

1343
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,480
All right.

1344
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:12,320
So here comes to nouveau putting its stupid head where it doesn't need to be.

1345
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:20,840
Um, so Geneva was come out saying that, you know, Hey, Hey people, we need some more business.

1346
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,920
So they're going to solve a problem that nobody has.

1347
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:29,920
And that is with folks, um, emulating switch games on PC.

1348
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,480
They're going to try to break it somehow.

1349
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:42,140
I imagine that that will go as well as it's gone with their PC security, meaning it's

1350
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:48,660
not going to make a difference and it's going to end up hurting the actual consumer more,

1351
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,260
which tends to be the case.

1352
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:54,940
So they are saying though, even if a game is protected against piracy on its PC version,

1353
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:58,980
uh, it says the release version of the switch can be emulated from day one and played on

1354
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,980
PC.

1355
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:05,180
Therefore bypassing the strong protection, um, or strong protections offered on the PC

1356
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:10,160
version, the Nintendo switch emulation protection will ensure that anyone wishing to play the

1357
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,600
game has to buy a legitimate copy.

1358
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,600
You're right.

1359
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,580
Like, cause no one's ever bypassed you or security.

1360
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:23,380
You're just impossible to beat like, and also like, even with like stuff like that, companies

1361
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,880
have done that in the past.

1362
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,920
Like you're not the first, they did this like even on like the 3DS and on like even older

1363
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,960
games on other platforms where if you have a pirated version, it just doesn't work the

1364
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,960
same way.

1365
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,960
Like there's things that are broken with it.

1366
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,360
Oh yeah, yeah.

1367
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,240
This whole thing strikes me as a challenge.

1368
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:46,920
Like Danuvo is just like, fight us and the entire internet's like, okay, they will lose.

1369
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,920
I'm sorry.

1370
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,760
Like they will end up losing Mike.

1371
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,960
Mike Defton chat says Danuvo on switch.

1372
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,960
Yeah.

1373
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,760
Now more games will run even worse on switch.

1374
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,760
Yeah.

1375
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,280
I'm suddenly reminded of like how well optimized and I say that tongue firmly planted in cheek,

1376
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:05,200
how well optimized cooking mama on the switch was where people were playing that game going,

1377
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,600
is this bitch mining Bitcoin on my switch?

1378
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,440
Why is this game running like such garbage?

1379
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,320
And that's what we have to look forward to.

1380
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:17,800
Yeah, I haven't weren't they in a switch game already or something like wasn't there some

1381
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,800
sort of DRA?

1382
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,800
I don't know.

1383
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:26,560
But anyways, they're saying that they're going to, you know, try to it just seems like marketing

1384
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,400
speak but like it's never worked.

1385
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:34,200
I think from what I remember, like, what would it Okay, let's just hypothetically let's just

1386
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:43,560
pretend for a second there that the concern was people, you know, emulating these games.

1387
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:48,880
Most of the time emulation happens after a game comes out like a while after the game

1388
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,880
comes out.

1389
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,880
Right.

1390
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,840
So like, if I can't emulate a day one, I don't think that's necessarily going to cause more

1391
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,680
sales to happen.

1392
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:03,300
It's just like if people are hell bent on emulating the game, they're not going to buy

1393
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,660
the game and all you're doing is hurting the consumer.

1394
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:09,740
A lot of pirates just keep an active stockpile of games they never intended to purchase in

1395
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,700
the first place, which I'm not saying makes it right.

1396
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,140
And I don't want to make it sound like I'm advocating for piracy.

1397
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:20,000
Like I understand that it can be very frustrating to see that people are playing switch releases

1398
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,620
on day one that they didn't pay for.

1399
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:23,620
Like I get that.

1400
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:28,060
Yeah, the thing the thing and I understand that the video game industry has a vested

1401
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:29,260
interest in protecting that.

1402
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:33,740
So again, I'm not defending the act of pirating modern day games.

1403
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:38,500
Now when it comes to emulating the Super Nintendo and the NES, I say we're in a completely different

1404
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:44,420
realm that has to do a game preservation licensing and all that bullshit fuckery that happens.

1405
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:50,100
That means we don't have classic fucking games like the Guardian Legend available to play

1406
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,580
on modern consoles.

1407
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:55,140
We have to emulate that and we need to be able to do that.

1408
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,140
However, here's here's the thing, sorry, Loki, before I let's finish.

1409
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:02,460
Here's the thing with this is that I think where we take issue with this is that Denuvo

1410
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:06,620
is coming in going, don't worry, I'll fix it.

1411
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,500
And it's like, shut up.

1412
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:15,500
Nobody asked you like, here's, did you consider maybe just doing your thing quietly and not

1413
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,460
having to advertise?

1414
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:22,780
Because what you're doing with this is you are literally inviting the entire dark side

1415
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:26,860
of the internet and the people you don't want to be doing this in the first, you are just

1416
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,980
inviting them to fight.

1417
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:33,900
You have, Denuvo has literally sent an email to all of the hackers and crackers in the

1418
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:39,020
entire galaxy going bike racks, 3pm, see you there.

1419
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:44,740
And now they're going to create a problem that I would argue didn't, it's that whole

1420
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:49,420
blowing something out of proportion because yes, is piracy happening on the Switch?

1421
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,420
Yes.

1422
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:53,340
Is piracy only going to get worse because of this announcement?

1423
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,340
Yes.

1424
01:12:54,820 --> 01:13:00,080
Does Nintendo think it's a problem that's, you know, warrants another company solving

1425
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,080
it for them?

1426
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:06,740
No, because Nintendo is not even involved in this initiative that Denuvo is taking themselves

1427
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:09,340
upon to try to solve.

1428
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,780
So like, who is going to utilize this?

1429
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:18,220
A third party company is like, a third party publisher is going to do that, like, then

1430
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:23,280
once people catch wind that that game has Denuvo, you know what that does on PC games?

1431
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,160
Most people try to avoid that shit.

1432
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:30,960
So like, it's like, Denuvo is up on their soapbox making a proclamation and Nintendo

1433
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:37,360
is down in front going, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.

1434
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:41,320
It's just, it's dumb.

1435
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,320
So dumb.

1436
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,840
SSJ 100 Matt brings up an excellent point.

1437
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,080
Piracy has become a necessary evil in the fight for game preservation.

1438
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,880
There are so many games disappearing forever on the 3DS store soon.

1439
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,880
Fact!

1440
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:01,680
That is well stated by SSJ 100 Matt and an excellent example of, somebody's going to

1441
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,040
wildly take me out of context.

1442
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,340
Don't do it, but I'm going to say it.

1443
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:07,880
Why we need piracy.

1444
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:16,880
Yeah, and on top of this too, like, okay, so yeah, this does also like, you know, allegedly

1445
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:22,720
could probably won't because their cop protection sucks, but could prohibit, you know, the backing

1446
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:28,920
up of these games later on for archival purpose, um, Denuvo claims that these checks that they

1447
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:33,480
would implement would be offline checks being meaning that the keys are going to be hidden

1448
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,580
within the games.

1449
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:43,080
How this is never going to not be like cracked immediately is beyond me how they think that

1450
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,800
this is going to ever work.

1451
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:53,200
It's not ever going to work, but I mean, sure, sure Denuvo.

1452
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:57,300
Phila9 with a really good question, I'm not actually sure the answer to in our chat asking

1453
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,200
are these games captured at the Library of Congress?

1454
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,680
I know they archive a lot of games.

1455
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,160
I think it would be impossible to archive everything.

1456
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,640
There's so many Indian self published things out there.

1457
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,400
I'm not sure they all get captured in an official governmental capacity.

1458
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:18,600
However, we have certainly heard of efforts, like for example, what we just had recently

1459
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:24,360
Embracer group, right, has that big, you know, museum physical place that they're building

1460
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:30,760
to try to preserve games like video game preservation is becoming more and more of a thing you see

1461
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,720
out there like, you know, just enthusiasts.

1462
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,520
And you kind of joke about your librarian brain.

1463
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:42,000
But I would argue others with librarian brains out there who also love video games are kind

1464
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,360
of trying to solve because I'm not sure there's like a government thing in there.

1465
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,840
Oh, and Bobby Blackwell puts an excellent point there.

1466
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,560
The games industry fights against libraries archiving their stuff.

1467
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,560
That's right.

1468
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,440
I remember this thing about this here, because if there is remotely a chance that someone

1469
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,920
could play the game for fun because of the library archive, that's a problem.

1470
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:04,320
I remember that was a story a couple years ago, towards the beginning of the pandemic.

1471
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,320
You're right.

1472
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,360
Somebody was trying to fight against that whole preservation thing because heaven forbid,

1473
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,640
somebody is, you know, pirating a game that's no longer for sale.

1474
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,080
It's just interesting.

1475
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:21,120
So but I think I think, again, once something is on the Internet, you're not going to get

1476
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,180
it off the Internet.

1477
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:28,400
And so you see other ways of archiving things that are out there, such as archive.org, right?

1478
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,380
The Internet archive is a big thing.

1479
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,020
But of course, they're getting sued over it.

1480
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:36,440
So yeah.

1481
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:41,800
But as Joe and Matt says, listen, I would pay for a service to play all of these old

1482
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,800
games.

1483
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,800
Anyone would.

1484
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,800
Well, I shouldn't say anyone would.

1485
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,360
And I don't want to make it sound like I'm belittling your comment because I'm not.

1486
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:52,980
But I think what it really comes down to is these legal issues that hold games back from

1487
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,240
being able to.

1488
01:16:54,240 --> 01:17:00,980
This is the part that bites the game industry in the fucking ass when it comes to this stuff.

1489
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:05,120
Like again, I'm going to use Guardian Legend as my example, because you know the love I

1490
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,260
have for that game.

1491
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:10,200
The Dark Sakura has to that game that Loki, I'm going to just say, has love for that game,

1492
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,420
whether he does or not.

1493
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:14,480
We have a big love for the Guardian Legend here at Orange Mountains Radio.

1494
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,160
And you again cannot play that game through legal purposes right now because it is caught

1495
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,520
up in licensing fuckery right now.

1496
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,880
And that is doing the games industry a disservice.

1497
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,120
If they were to put out the Guardian Legend for 10 bucks on the Nintendo Switch, I would

1498
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,120
buy it tomorrow.

1499
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,280
I bet Dark Sakura would be tempted to pick it up as well.

1500
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,260
I think there'd be a lot of people who would pick it up.

1501
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:34,260
But it doesn't happen.

1502
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,260
Why?

1503
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:36,260
Because of these issues.

1504
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:44,440
And the business side of video games ruins video games way too often in this industry.

1505
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,440
And it sucks.

1506
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:54,140
Anyway, Savalusan Chat, hi, says, we need a video game vault just like the seed vault

1507
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,140
in Norway.

1508
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:59,640
Well, ironically, that whole Embracer group thing I'm talking about is what they're trying

1509
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,120
to basically build.

1510
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,360
So there is that.

1511
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:08,500
Bobby Black Wolf with an interesting perspective too saying Super Mario Brothers will enter

1512
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,640
the public domain in 2060.

1513
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:16,940
It'll be very interesting to see what happens in the future as you know, because I didn't

1514
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:24,360
they refuse to extend the Disney law any further like Mickey Mouse, circa Steamboat Willie

1515
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,820
is going into the public domain if he hasn't already, right?

1516
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:32,460
Like Disney ran out of time finally, and they couldn't convince Congress to buy more.

1517
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,220
So it's going to be interesting.

1518
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:39,320
So anyway, all right, let's move on.

1519
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:46,960
Let's talk about Steam, the mobile app version, which it hasn't been updated in a long time,

1520
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,760
but it's going to be getting updated, which is great because I kind of think the mobile

1521
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,160
app they have now is a little bit clunky and aged.

1522
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:56,960
So they're going to be updating the app, of course, Android and iOS we're talking about.

1523
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:03,760
And they're going to be, I guess they've already invited invested users to beta test this app.

1524
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:11,060
Using a redesigned client, they've built it on a new framework, they've modernized design.

1525
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:16,300
So you can do more intelligent notifications, multi account support, that's nice.

1526
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:19,140
And this is great, a new way to get into your account.

1527
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,820
So you don't have to worry about the username, the password, the Steam guard, you just use

1528
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:26,740
a QR code like you do on Discord or Signal or something like that.

1529
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:30,020
That is going to be the most time saving new feature that they're putting into that, which

1530
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,300
is cool.

1531
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,280
Apparently the beta is still running a little bit sluggish right now, but they're hoping

1532
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,800
to get that working before it comes out.

1533
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:43,920
So iOS does have a beta, that beta is limited to 10,000 users right now because of the restrictions

1534
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,640
of test flight.

1535
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:50,200
But you can check that out on the Steam website if you're curious to get into it, steamcommunity.com

1536
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,520
slash groups slash Steam mobile app.

1537
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,280
I'll wait for the full release, but I think this is an exciting thing that's coming.

1538
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:00,720
The Steam mobile app badly needed something like this, especially when it comes to Steam

1539
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:01,740
Guard.

1540
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:04,460
So I think that's cool.

1541
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:07,620
Going to chat, they're talking about public domain things.

1542
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:12,700
Bobby Black Wolf and DJ Rama S are pointing out Winnie the Pooh is in public domain now,

1543
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,260
hence the horror movie.

1544
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:20,020
Yes, I actually, I know the people there through a weird like three degrees of separation type

1545
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:21,580
of thing.

1546
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:26,100
And so that's, yeah, that's a great point is that's the type of stuff.

1547
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:32,660
But if I remember right, it's only Winnie the Pooh and not Christopher Robin the way

1548
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,920
he's portrayed in the Disney movies.

1549
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,240
Like it's very interesting what they can and can't do.

1550
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:42,200
So we'll see more and more and more stuff like that to come in the future.

1551
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,680
I wonder if that's why we see all this Pinocchio stuff now too.

1552
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:49,800
But that was, that was based on a book that wasn't like an original Disney thing, right?

1553
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,480
So that book has to be public domain at this point.

1554
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:55,860
All right.

1555
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:57,900
Anyway, let's move on.

1556
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:03,340
Um, an update on an incredibly frustrating story, Dark Sakura.

1557
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:11,620
So and I've actually been following her now for a little bit.

1558
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:22,900
So we were following the story of Kethals, Clara Sorrenti, who had been doxxed and, and

1559
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:27,640
I've got a little bit more on this than just what the article says too, has had to leave

1560
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:38,960
Canada because of harassment and is living in an undisclosed location in Europe.

1561
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,220
And there's a lot, there's a lot more.

1562
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:47,960
So I'll go ahead and read what, what she said, as a Twitch broadcaster, my livelihood relies

1563
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:52,880
on the connections I form with my audience and is harder than it would be in any other

1564
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:57,500
profession to keep my location hidden, hidden, I want to keep working and because I know

1565
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:01,360
I have this huge target on my back, I've decided to take refuge in Europe where I have close

1566
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,960
friends who are willing to host me, so I can continue to stream while my stalkers continuously

1567
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:11,320
try to hunt me down and send the message I am never safe.

1568
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:15,520
And she also had posted about her Uber account being hacked and like a bunch of food showing

1569
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,560
up that was charged on her account.

1570
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,680
You would think Uber would have a safeguard on that after you order so many different

1571
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,880
restaurants.

1572
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,660
Like I can, I can understand why somebody might order from two or three different restaurants,

1573
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:32,620
you know, depending on what picky eaters or party, but the amount of food she got, like,

1574
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:34,160
why didn't Uber have a fail safe on that?

1575
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,160
That's really weird to me.

1576
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,160
I don't know.

1577
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,160
That's beside the point.

1578
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:43,260
Well, well, well, I, I would say that, yeah, companies, all companies need to realize there

1579
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,520
are shitty people out there doing shitty things.

1580
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:51,320
But anyway, I know it's, it's past the main point, but Uber does need to look into it.

1581
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:59,900
Anyway, um, the whole thing has been going because she's had a very big, uh, campaign

1582
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:05,000
now to get this, uh, harassment site Kiwi Farms taken down.

1583
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,360
Uh, and the site's been taken down a few times.

1584
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:14,320
Um, but, but she's been working really hard and knowing what this site is.

1585
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:21,120
Um, there have been many, many, many, uh, outreach has gone to Cloudflare who has been

1586
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:29,280
hosting them and not paying attention to any of, of the demands that have been, you know,

1587
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,280
going on.

1588
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:38,600
And these are people who have got done full, uh, uh, harassment, uh, I would almost say

1589
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:50,000
campaigns against other people, um, and have, you know, been a hotbed for racism, antisemitism,

1590
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,080
transphobia, homophobia, you name it.

1591
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:59,440
If it's not, you know, this gender white male, they've got a problem with it.

1592
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:06,560
Um, and also, uh, for supporting, uh, Putin just also adding that in there too.

1593
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:15,480
So, um, but thankfully she, uh, hasn't slacked off at all in her advocacy.

1594
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,800
There are people making fake accounts.

1595
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,960
I found one that was deleted just today.

1596
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:27,640
Um, there are, it's, it's just people still spreading misinformation about her.

1597
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:31,360
People just, it's disgusting.

1598
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,440
It's really disgusting.

1599
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:37,280
And she is keeping her head high and working hard on it.

1600
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:44,360
And honestly, I, I, she's doing really amazing work under a really stressful situation.

1601
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:49,280
And I think that we need to make sure that we get the word spread to support her and

1602
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,240
support what she's doing.

1603
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:57,280
And also make sure that we, you know, go out saying that this type of behavior is not going

1604
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:03,360
to be permitted in our society, will not be tolerated, and that we will stand up against

1605
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,360
it.

1606
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,360
Yeah.

1607
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,040
Um, definitely good for her for hanging in there.

1608
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:13,720
Um, I, I don't know how she's doing it cause she's just constantly taking abuse.

1609
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:14,720
It's sick.

1610
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:22,720
They went, they went on her father's, uh, Memorial Facebook and we're taking photos

1611
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:26,880
that were on that account and captioning them saying that he would be disappointed with

1612
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,240
her and that he would hate her and all of this when she was like, no, he was completely

1613
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,640
supportive of me all up until the end.

1614
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,780
So how can some people sleep at night?

1615
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:37,360
How can some people sleep at night?

1616
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,360
So gross.

1617
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,820
There are evil people in the world and they don't care what they do because they have

1618
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:48,880
anonymity behind them except for, uh, the, the guy who's, I think running the Kiwi farm

1619
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,880
site.

1620
01:25:49,880 --> 01:26:00,640
Um, apparently a trans person that, uh, that he had doxed showed up at his house and, uh,

1621
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:06,320
he went and hid in his bedroom and his mother dealt with, dealt with her.

1622
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,120
Like the scared little bitch that they were.

1623
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:15,200
Oh, and his mother's just as bad as he is apparently, but it's just completely unforgivable

1624
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,520
and they're not human.

1625
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:23,160
I'm not a super religious person, but I do firmly believe that for those people, God

1626
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:26,160
or whatever you want to call it, God is going to kick your ass.

1627
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,200
That is, I firmly believe it.

1628
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,360
So for the record, that isn't karma.

1629
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:31,360
That's not what karma is.

1630
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,920
I didn't call it karma.

1631
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:33,920
Yeah.

1632
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,600
I'm just, I'm telling that for other people.

1633
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:40,280
People like to say that that's karma when that is not what karma is.

1634
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,320
Um, it's appropriate to have to use that term.

1635
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:53,160
Um, but I do believe that the, you know, it's a physics law, you know, uh, for every action

1636
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,680
there is an opposite and equal reaction, right?

1637
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,660
The reaction is going to come.

1638
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:02,960
It's already coming.

1639
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:09,600
And these people are going, look, already that guy in his site is losing, um, public

1640
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,600
opinion.

1641
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,960
He put out a statement saying, I've been losing public opinion and men men men men

1642
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:15,960
men.

1643
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:16,960
And we're like, okay, cry me a big river.

1644
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,960
You big baby.

1645
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,800
Go hide in mommy's closet.

1646
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,800
Yeah.

1647
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:25,480
Like if you want to dish it out, you need to be able to take it too.

1648
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,480
Yeah.

1649
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,960
All right.

1650
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:32,540
Let's move on, uh, onto, I would say onto a happier note, although I'm not sure lawsuits

1651
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:35,800
are usually happy stories, but, um, it's the best transition I've got.

1652
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,160
So Loki, what's next?

1653
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,160
All right.

1654
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:43,200
So, um, let's talk about more lawsuits.

1655
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:51,120
So Sony is being sued for $5.9 billion, uh, allegedly for ripping people off on digital

1656
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,120
games.

1657
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:56,840
And the reason that they're trying to make, or the, the reason that they're suing or the

1658
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:02,320
argument that they're trying to make is that because Sony charges a 30% commission fee

1659
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,540
and all digital purchases made through the UK PlayStation store.

1660
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:13,320
This is a UK lawsuit, um, that it causes, I guess the games to be higher priced also

1661
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:19,960
because they control their own digital marketplace.

1662
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:28,080
Like I mean, all the other companies do, um, that they are anti-competitive.

1663
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:32,760
And so because of that, since there's no competition, um, it leaves the prices being

1664
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:33,760
high.

1665
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,000
I think it's gonna be a hard argument for them to make.

1666
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,560
It's gonna be very hard.

1667
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,640
It's like, that's like that Epic games, Apple argument that didn't work out well.

1668
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:50,620
So Sony is not doing anything different from what many peers in several industries are

1669
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,720
also doing.

1670
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:56,520
So I just don't see how this, why PlayStation is getting called out when they're literally

1671
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,280
doing the exact same thing, Nintendo and Microsoft specifically.

1672
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:03,080
And then if you kind of go further out into other entertainment industries, you know,

1673
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:07,280
Apple, Google, and you know, the folks on the phones, this is like this 30% is pretty

1674
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,280
much a standard.

1675
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,280
Yeah.

1676
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:15,520
And I guess you could say with Microsoft, it might be harder to make that argument because

1677
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,240
they have their games on other platforms.

1678
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,860
Like they have Microsoft games on steam.

1679
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:25,860
You can get Microsoft games on the Microsoft game store.

1680
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:30,780
Um, so that might be harder to make the argument or they just pick Sony to start, you know,

1681
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:31,780
trying to Sue.

1682
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:33,560
I don't think they're going to win.

1683
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,500
I don't think this, anything's going to come of this, but I don't either.

1684
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,980
I think it gets laughed out of court.

1685
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:39,980
Yeah.

1686
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:46,660
It's, I mean, they're probably just like, well, if we win even 1%, that's a lot of money.

1687
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:48,340
I don't think that's going to happen.

1688
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:49,940
I don't either, but we'll see.

1689
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:50,940
We'll keep an eye on it.

1690
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,020
All right.

1691
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,020
Another thing to keep an eye on.

1692
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:54,020
This is a game.

1693
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:55,020
We don't talk about enough.

1694
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,460
This game is so cool.

1695
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:01,140
I really enjoy just some chill with Microsoft flight simulator.

1696
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:05,220
And we got some news that a games com that a big upgrade for Microsoft flight simulator

1697
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:08,180
is incoming on November the 11th.

1698
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:09,920
Originally this was supposed to come on the 22nd.

1699
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,540
And this is the rare story of an expansion getting bumped up as opposed to bump back,

1700
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:16,300
but it's apparently ready to go.

1701
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,460
And this is the 40th anniversary edition.

1702
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:22,980
Obviously we're celebrating the flight simulator series as a whole.

1703
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:29,260
And this new expansion will basically be free for those that have Xbox game pass because

1704
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,460
the original games on it.

1705
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:36,140
What will be added in this helicopters and gliders you'll be able to, which is the first

1706
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,900
time they've been seen in the series for a while.

1707
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:44,020
Also going to be added to the series an actual like commercial airliner.

1708
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:49,640
They have some in the game, but the very popular Airbus A310 is going to be added to the game.

1709
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:53,380
So if you want to fly your own, I guess, Southwest flight, you can do that.

1710
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:54,800
So that's kind of neat.

1711
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,440
There's also some more historical aircraft that are getting added to the game.

1712
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:05,240
The Spruce Goose, the Spirit of St. Louis, the original flight from May of 1927.

1713
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,500
Those are going in the game.

1714
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:13,180
They're also going to be adding some more airports, glider airports, heliports, and

1715
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:14,180
so on.

1716
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:20,580
There's also a new city update that just came out that includes photo improvements

1717
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:26,920
for some locations in Germany, which of course is the home of Gamescom.

1718
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:33,160
So that's why Germany got some cities like Canover, Cologne, and so forth got their cities

1719
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,060
reworked a little bit for Gamescom.

1720
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,380
So pretty cool.

1721
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:40,900
Anyway, I definitely recommend flight simulator, especially if you're a game pass person, then

1722
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,820
there's really nothing to pay for it.

1723
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:48,620
It's a really good use case for cloud as well, because the download is gigantic, but it plays

1724
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:49,620
fine on the cloud.

1725
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:50,620
It's super cute.

1726
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:54,700
So that's one I definitely recommend checking out.

1727
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:56,820
All right.

1728
01:31:56,820 --> 01:32:02,800
So flight simulator turns 40, and that's certainly a classic game.

1729
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,820
But every week here on the program, we like to highlight another classic game in this

1730
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:08,500
segment coming up right now.

1731
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:24,420
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1732
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:25,780
out a classic and-

1733
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:26,780
What's the difference between-

1734
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:31,980
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1735
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:32,980
Sorry about that.

1736
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:38,500
A dumb ad came up while I was trying to get the B roll up here, but Dark Soccer-

1737
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,500
You pay for it.

1738
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,500
Yeah.

1739
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,500
Dark Soccer, why don't you tell us-

1740
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,500
I pay for it.

1741
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:44,540
I pay for mine.

1742
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:47,220
Let's get to the classic game of the week.

1743
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:49,880
What game did you pick for us this week?

1744
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:56,140
I picked Final Fantasy Tactics, which I haven't done it before, and I pretty much know why.

1745
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:58,500
I'm not a fan of tactics games.

1746
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:07,180
As much as I love Final Fantasy, and as much as this series is well beloved by many people,

1747
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:09,380
I don't like tactics games.

1748
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:16,260
But I'm still going to cover it because I know a lot of people do like tactics games.

1749
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:21,660
I would also like to just point out that if someone says they don't like something, don't

1750
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:22,660
immediately go,

1751
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:23,660
Yeah, well, I do.

1752
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:24,660
Like it's a personal challenge.

1753
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,660
Just saying.

1754
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:35,420
Anyway, it came out for PlayStation, published by Square, released in Japan on June 1994

1755
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:42,460
and in the U.S. January 1998 by Sony Computer Entertainment, the very first of the Tactics

1756
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:45,980
series in the Final Fantasy franchise.

1757
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:52,300
And it's the first game that's set in the fictional world, later known as...

1758
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,820
Is it Ivalice, I think?

1759
01:33:54,820 --> 01:34:05,140
So it follows Ramza Bolv, I guess I can't pronounce that, who is a cadet who is in a

1760
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:11,700
military conflict called the Lion War and about the stuff going on with it.

1761
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:21,980
Anyway, production began in 1995 by Matsuno Yasumi, who had created Ogre Battle with Quest.

1762
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:35,940
But there was a desire to do a tactic game that involved class-based conflict and writing

1763
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:37,540
history.

1764
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:41,380
And so they were that director and writer.

1765
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:47,740
And then Sakaguchi Hironobu, who was the Final Fantasy creator, was a producer and they just

1766
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:59,900
got more and more awesome people in as they kept doing, including Iwata as a composer.

1767
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:06,740
So at any rate, the game is...

1768
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:09,220
Actually this is a different Iwata, I don't know why I said that.

1769
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:16,660
This is Masaharu, but moving forward.

1770
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:25,660
The game itself, it really pushed some boundaries when it came out.

1771
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:30,580
So we're basically going to go into a little bit of that gameplay.

1772
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:32,120
It's a tactics game.

1773
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:36,700
So you follow your protagonist through the game and you have two modes, you have battles

1774
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,700
and world map.

1775
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:45,620
Battles will be on isometric fields and you move them by tiles and they have different

1776
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:55,780
attacks and it is turn-based, although they have a charge time that is going into play

1777
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:57,440
inside those battles.

1778
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,700
You have your hit points for your enemies, your hit points yourself, you get experience

1779
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:01,700
points as you go along.

1780
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:08,880
And in the world map, you move on these paths connecting towns and battle points.

1781
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,140
And of course, when your character icon is on the town, you can open a menu there where

1782
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:17,060
you can go to the bar to look for side quests or shop for supplies or soldier office for

1783
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,900
recruiting.

1784
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:23,780
You also can go to fur shops that you get for poaching.

1785
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:25,700
Don't approve of that, but whatever.

1786
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:28,660
You do get some random battles.

1787
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:37,460
And then if you go over these certain green spots, then you will get another random encounter.

1788
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:41,060
It does have a character class system that lets you customize your characters into different

1789
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:42,060
roles.

1790
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:48,100
So you have most of the original character classes from Final Fantasy games, like summoners,

1791
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:54,660
black mages, white mages, monks, dragoons, and thieves.

1792
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:58,060
Black mages were called wizards, white mages were called priests, and dragons were called

1793
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:00,220
lancers.

1794
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:06,060
You have new, you start out as either a squire or a chemist, which is the base for either

1795
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:12,780
a warrior or magician job, and it has like 20 something jobs.

1796
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:17,580
You get job points that you can apply to your different jobs as well.

1797
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:21,180
And then when you've learned all the abilities in that job class, you're considered mastered

1798
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:24,900
and you can learn something else.

1799
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:34,340
So at any rate, it was actually conceived in 93 by Sakaguchi, who loves tactics games.

1800
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:40,260
And he was unable to work on it at the time due to the main series.

1801
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:50,300
But eventually things came together and they were, he teamed up with Matsuno, of course,

1802
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:54,820
like I said, who worked on the Ogre Battle series, and when Tactics Ogre Let Us Cling

1803
01:37:54,820 --> 01:38:01,860
Together was done, then they went over and started working on the game.

1804
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:12,060
It was, the music in and of itself was also written by two people who worked on Ogre Battle,

1805
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:18,620
so Iwata Masaharu and Sakimoto Hitoshi.

1806
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:26,340
They worked on that and they actually did release CDs by DigiCube on June 21st, 1997,

1807
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:30,620
and re-released by Squenix on March 24th, 2006.

1808
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:33,740
So there were other versions.

1809
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:38,380
Tactics first came out, like I said, June 20th, 1997, and it came bundled with a demo

1810
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:40,820
disc for Saga Frontier.

1811
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:48,460
And then the English localization was outsourced, although part of the localization had been

1812
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:55,920
done by Square USA's Michael Baskett and did a script kind of like Old English, but it

1813
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,900
made it really hard to understand the games that was toned down.

1814
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:09,020
It came out in North America January 28th, 1998, and it also was re-released to Square's

1815
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:11,500
Millennium Collection.

1816
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:17,260
This series was released in Japan and each title had its own set of different merchandise.

1817
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:24,020
Final Fantasy Tactics was sold June 29th, 2000, along with Saga Frontier, Saga Frontier

1818
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:32,780
2, Brave Fencer Musashi, Front Mission 3, Ergeiz, and Legend of Mana.

1819
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:39,100
It was selected to be part of the Greatest Hits re-releases four years after its initial

1820
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:44,380
release, and then it also then became a part of the Ultimate Hits, which was their budget

1821
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:45,380
range in Japan.

1822
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:51,500
There was a PSP PlayStation Portable version called Final Fantasy Tactics The War of the

1823
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:57,580
Lions came out May 10th, 2007 in Japan and then other places after.

1824
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:02,780
Second game is part of the Ivalice Alliance.

1825
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:07,420
It also had an updated version of the original Final Fantasy Tactics with in-game cutscenes,

1826
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:10,700
new characters, and multiplayer.

1827
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:16,220
It also updated to a 16.9 widescreen support, new items, new jobs, cel-shaded full motion

1828
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:17,220
videos.

1829
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:23,020
And the English version has voice acting where the Japanese version does not.

1830
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:30,940
The game sold almost 825,000 copies in Japan in the first half of 1997 and ended with 1.24

1831
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:33,700
million copies sold.

1832
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:40,540
By the end of 2007, it had sold approximately 1.3 million copies in Japan and then, as of

1833
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:46,420
August 2011, 2.4 million copies worldwide.

1834
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:48,940
It was greatly lauded.

1835
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:54,140
People thought that it was challenging and required, you know, definitely more strategy

1836
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:57,180
and a little bit more involvement.

1837
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:02,900
The spell effects, 3D backgrounds, the camera being rotatable, zooming, all of that.

1838
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:07,660
Other reviewers didn't really like it, but they don't count.

1839
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:13,340
There's some people who said it should have been 2D, man, like no.

1840
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:27,100
It just really, the story especially was praised, although having so many characters look similar

1841
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:30,860
made it hard to distinguish who was who.

1842
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:39,260
And of course, the English localization was overrun with grammatical mistakes, so I'm

1843
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,380
just saying.

1844
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:45,420
Like I was telling the people who did Hooked on You, get a proofreader.

1845
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:48,620
But soundtrack, of course, was greatly praised.

1846
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:52,980
IGN gave the Editor's Choice Award in 1998.

1847
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:57,460
GameSpot listed as one of the greatest games of all time in 2007.

1848
01:41:57,460 --> 01:42:01,180
It just, it won more and more and more.

1849
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:07,420
So the world for Final Fantasy Tactics has been featured in other games.

1850
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:14,420
The development staff that did Vagrant Story also had references to Final Fantasy Tactics,

1851
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:19,060
and they are both set in the same world.

1852
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:27,300
And Final Fantasy XII, when it was released, is also in the same world, the world of Ivalice.

1853
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:37,020
Final Fantasy XIII Revenant Wings was also supposed to have been sent in the same world.

1854
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:43,060
Final Fantasy Tactics Advance came out in 2003 and had a smaller cast of characters

1855
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,500
and a little bit simpler of a plot.

1856
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:51,820
It's an indirect sequel, came out called Final Fantasy Tactics A2, Grimoire of the Rift.

1857
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:59,140
Ramza and Agrias were in the online card game Lord of the Million 3 in 2014.

1858
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:03,940
Ramza is playable in Dissidia Final Fantasy NT.

1859
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:11,780
In Final Fantasy XIV, A Realm Reborn had an alternate version of Ramza and his companions

1860
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:15,100
that died at the end of Tactics.

1861
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:19,020
So they're in Final Fantasy XIV.

1862
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:23,220
Final Fantasy Tactics is featured in the Final Fantasy Trading Card Game with Ramza, Delita,

1863
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:29,100
Agrias, and other characters appearing in Opus 1.

1864
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:32,660
Tactics has appeared in other of the Opuses.

1865
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:37,620
And there's a remix song of Avelia and Delita that was nominated for Best Game Music Cover

1866
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:45,860
Remix at the 16th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards.

1867
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:47,740
And that's it.

1868
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:50,060
Final Fantasy Tactics is ooze.

1869
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:51,460
All right.

1870
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:52,460
Great pick.

1871
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:57,300
I know it's not a game that you're personally into, but I kind of felt like what you were

1872
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:02,620
saying in the beginning about the whole, like, you know, this tactics isn't usually a genre.

1873
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:05,660
And even for me, I don't usually get into tactics.

1874
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:06,660
Tactical games is a genre.

1875
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:11,100
I don't get entertained by them very often, but I have a deep love of Final Fantasy.

1876
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,020
So it was one of those things where I was like, I had to try this one.

1877
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:14,820
And I, I do, I do like it.

1878
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:21,860
I don't think I'm as into it as like some other people are, but I do find it very interesting

1879
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:25,140
that Square- You're not dating, but you're very good friends.

1880
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:26,140
Yeah.

1881
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:27,140
Yeah.

1882
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:29,700
You know, I have the phone number in my phone that I might want to call once in a while

1883
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:30,700
when I'm feeling lonely.

1884
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:37,420
You know, it's just one of those things where it's like, I'm surprised that Square hasn't

1885
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:41,060
tried to do more of these games with how well received it.

1886
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:42,060
You know, yes.

1887
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:43,060
I know there was advances.

1888
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:44,060
I mean, I'm just surprised-

1889
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,060
Favorite story.

1890
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:46,060
They've done a few others.

1891
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:51,700
But I mean, specifically Final Fantasy, you know, but yeah, but I like what they did with

1892
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:52,700
the job system.

1893
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:56,780
I liked, you know, that in the game and definitely you see this game's influence on other Final

1894
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:57,780
Fantasy games.

1895
01:44:57,780 --> 01:45:02,500
Force 14, you know, some of the other things you named there in that.

1896
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03,500
But yeah.

1897
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:07,060
So yeah, great pick, Final Fantasy Tactics.

1898
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:09,540
A real classic, if there ever was one.

1899
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:10,940
All right.

1900
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:15,900
Let's move on and talk about some other quick headlines around the gaming industry and some

1901
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,900
rapid fire news.

1902
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:18,900
We'll start with Loki.

1903
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:21,460
Everybody's got a podcast now.

1904
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:25,380
So- Well, we were first.

1905
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:26,540
We were one of the first guests.

1906
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:27,540
One of the first.

1907
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:38,420
So Sakurai has got his own podcast now on YouTube, or I should say it's like a YouTube

1908
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:42,700
series and talking about game development.

1909
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,820
So that's pretty cool.

1910
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:45,820
And then-

1911
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:48,720
He is allowed to do whatever he wants, including a podcast.

1912
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:53,340
He's delivered on every wish that people have for the Smash Brothers series over the years.

1913
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:57,660
He's worked day and night and all the time in between on those games.

1914
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:58,660
You know what?

1915
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:04,380
If he wants to do a podcast, may it be the best podcast there ever was.

1916
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:08,140
Except for this one, of course.

1917
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:13,620
Also Hideo Kojima announced that he's got a podcast exclusively for Spotify.

1918
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:14,620
How dare he?

1919
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:16,620
It's called Brain Structure.

1920
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:20,740
You can check that out there.

1921
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:25,780
And then, of course, we have an acquisition in the indie scape.

1922
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:32,020
So we've got Tiny Build has acquired a Bossa Studios, who are best known for their weird

1923
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:36,780
simulation games or weird like physics comedy games.

1924
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:41,900
So they have, of course, I Am Bread, Surgeon Simulator, I Am Fish.

1925
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:47,540
So those have been- that's been purchased by Tiny Build for $3 million.

1926
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:48,540
Great.

1927
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,540
Great.

1928
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,540
All right.

1929
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:51,540
Yeah.

1930
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:57,580
Darsakra, with, I think, some more insight on something that came up last week or the

1931
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:58,580
week before.

1932
01:46:58,580 --> 01:46:59,580
Yeah.

1933
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:06,260
Except show role actually accidentally got closed, my apologies.

1934
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:11,100
So yeah, so I'm a fan of Guilty Gear.

1935
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:12,100
I like this series.

1936
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:16,300
I've cosplayed Baikon from it, much to my husband's chagrin because of how much cleavage

1937
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:18,620
it showed.

1938
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:23,460
But there's a character who has been problematic, and that's Bridget.

1939
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:33,340
Bridget originally was a boy raised as a girl, not necessarily choosing that as an identity,

1940
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:35,000
I reckon.

1941
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:44,900
But now they finally have just completely come out and said, no, she's trans.

1942
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:52,220
She is, in fact, this is as of Guilty Gear Strive, that they confirmed that Bridget

1943
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:59,340
is transgender and that, but she had been using, people had used masculine pronouns

1944
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:07,380
toward her, but now she is officially being referred to as her correct gender.

1945
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:09,340
She's wearing, of course, the feminine clothes.

1946
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:15,480
She still always presented herself as a woman.

1947
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:23,160
And so now she is still, she is now completely being referred to as a woman.

1948
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:29,260
And it's about time, you know, she had been misgendered for an age.

1949
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:34,640
She was sort of like in this middle ground where they, you know, people were referring

1950
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:39,760
to as, and I hate using the term, but people were refusing to her as a trap.

1951
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:43,320
And that's completely unfair to the trans community.

1952
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:47,480
It's completely disgust, you know, disgusting that people would do that.

1953
01:48:47,480 --> 01:49:03,800
And so now like we've had in this one, so they've had a scene now in the arcade mode

1954
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:10,340
where Bridget is talking with Dickinson and Kaikisuke about her self-discovering and how

1955
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:15,240
she's learned herself and that the final destination will be worthwhile.

1956
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:23,120
And they agreed with her and they, you know, provided some advice, like legit advice, leave

1957
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:28,320
behind the fear of prejudice, become who you were meant to be.

1958
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:33,000
It's all worth the heartache to be your true self.

1959
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:42,860
And then she responds to a statement about being a cowgirl, like cowgirl is fine because

1960
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:45,380
I'm a girl.

1961
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:48,700
So I think that's awesome.

1962
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:55,080
And there's apparently other bits of dialogue in the game, but Arc System is really sticking

1963
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,820
with this translation and they're doing a great, a great job.

1964
01:49:57,820 --> 01:49:58,820
Yeah.

1965
01:49:58,820 --> 01:50:00,980
Sounds like they've done some really good course correcting there.

1966
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:05,620
I know this, this kind of was first came up like a week or two ago when people were downloading

1967
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:10,100
that DLC, but it's nice that the company's kind of confirming it and, you know, giving

1968
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:11,580
that extra insight there.

1969
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:12,580
Pretty cool.

1970
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:22,460
And then also there's still, there's also the character of Testament who is a non-binary.

1971
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:31,020
And this is both of the, both of their identities are built in now to the fabric of the story.

1972
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:46,100
And then of course the scene has been uploaded onto Twitter and I will be reposting that

1973
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:48,100
from my own Twitter.

1974
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:49,100
Cool.

1975
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,100
All right.

1976
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:53,220
Well, I don't follow, I have to admit, I don't follow Guilty Gear as closely.

1977
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:57,340
I just, I just haven't, I don't have time to play everything, but a fighting game franchise

1978
01:50:57,340 --> 01:51:00,500
I have been keeping my eyes on over the years is Mortal Kombat.

1979
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:05,580
And with Mortal Kombat celebrating its 30th anniversary, we're finding out some more details,

1980
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:10,900
just some behind the scenes stuff, which ironically in an interesting way, speaking of Dragon

1981
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:14,580
Con coming up, Bobby has a really cool panel.

1982
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:20,380
Bobby's getting to do a Mortal Kombat panel with, I forget, it's two of the mocap actors

1983
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:23,660
from the original game that are going to be on the panel.

1984
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:27,740
So, and I believe they had some hand, it's not like Ed Boon or anything.

1985
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:32,540
It's, I think it's the brothers, Carlos, Pecina, and I can't remember the other guy's name,

1986
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:34,420
but they're going to be on the panel.

1987
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:36,180
And I think that's going to be a fun one to see.

1988
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:40,100
So I'm hoping it doesn't conflict with any of my other panels so I can go watch it just

1989
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:43,380
as a fan of Mortal Kombat, the old school games.

1990
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:48,220
But Ed Boon has been dropping a lot of neat little things on Twitter and so forth, talking

1991
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:53,620
this week about Sonya and how Sonya wasn't originally in the game, saying that on April

1992
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:58,340
10th, they tested an unfinished version of Mortal Kombat with only six fighters at a

1993
01:51:58,340 --> 01:52:05,740
Chicago arcade called Times Square, the name of the arcade in Chicago, not New York, and

1994
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:08,060
talking about basically how Sonya was made from there.

1995
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:15,740
But Sonya started out as a character named Curtis Stryker, but they changed Curtis Stryker

1996
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:20,380
into Sonya Blade, but it ended up being the same backstory because they decided they wanted

1997
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:23,740
that fighter to be female, so they did a pivot there.

1998
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:31,140
But ironically, Curtis Stryker was basically Jax, so they did revisit that concept, but

1999
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:34,700
they made him Jax and put him in Mortal Kombat 2.

2000
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:37,620
And then, of course, you might go, well, wait a minute, isn't Stryker a name for Mortal

2001
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:38,620
Kombat?

2002
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:39,620
Yeah.

2003
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:43,060
Then they used the name Stryker in Mortal Kombat 3.

2004
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:46,940
So I just think that's kind of interesting how this original development for the character

2005
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:51,620
kind of ended up getting split out amongst all these other Mortal Kombat characters,

2006
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:53,660
but that's how development works sometimes.

2007
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:56,260
So I just thought that was some pretty cool insight.

2008
01:52:56,260 --> 01:53:02,900
All right, let's move on, travel around the world for some release dates and see what

2009
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:06,660
games will be celebrating some 30th anniversaries in 2052.

2010
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:10,420

01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:41,420
A crayon Shin-chan?

2023
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:44,460
Looks like really bad artwork.

2024
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:49,700
Not crayon Shin-chan, it's like, I don't know, maybe?

2025
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:54,100
It's like slightly better than crayon, but yes, it's the same character.

2026
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:56,100
Okay, gotcha.

2027
01:54:56,100 --> 01:55:04,940
Anomutinim, or Mutationim, I guess that's how you pronounce that, on Nintendo Switch,

Chinsou Club on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, Gerda, A Flame in Winter

01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:08,780

And we also have Pretty Presents Nice Classics Volume 3 on PC and Nintendo Switch.

01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:17,260
All right, going to Japan.

2039
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:18,380
It's a little lighter this week.

2040
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:21,860
I seem to remember last week it was really, really packed, but this week we have just

2041
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:23,700
a few things on Nintendo Switch.

2042
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:27,340
On September the 1st, we have Made in Abyss, Binary Star Falling into Darkness.

2043
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:31,900
I think most of these overlap with U.S. games, but these are Japanese releases as well.

2044
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:32,900
That's on the Switch.

2045
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:37,180
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure All Star Battle R, also on the Switch in Japan this week.

01:56:53,860 --> 01:56:55,300
Switch this week.

2051
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:59,380
Heading over to the PlayStation 5, that same Lord of the Rings game is also on the PlayStation

2052
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:00,380
5.

2053
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:06,460
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure also on the PlayStation 5, and the Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap is

And Thymesia is also out on the PlayStation 5 this week.

That's it.

2057
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:18,740
Let's go to Europe.

2058
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:26,660
On the 30th, we have for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, Destroy All Humans 2 re-probed.

2061
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:40,500
Moving on to the second, the rest of these are all in the second, we have The Ascent

2062
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:42,620
for PlayStation and Xbox.

2063
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:45,220

All right.

2068
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:03,460
We have a few more news stories for you guys, and then we'll be inviting your phone calls

2069
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:08,420
over at vognetwork.com slash Discord in the green room.

2070
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:11,540
We'll get to any emails and tweets if we have any of those.

2071
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:14,660
But first, we have a few more stories for you.

2072
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:16,260
Loki!

2073
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:24,260
Yeah, so this is unfortunate news, but so there's a company called Toge Productions

2074
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:26,740
and Mojiken Studio.

2075
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:30,900
They had a point and click game coming out called A Space for the Unbound.

2076
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:40,500
And they were in negotiation with PQ Games, who had published Galgun in the past, to have,

2077
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:43,220
you know, publish that on consoles for them as well.

2078
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:47,380
And they were also going to handle the publishing in western regions.

2079
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:56,340
However, they've had to terminate their contract with PQ Games because there's been some manipulation

2080
01:58:56,340 --> 01:59:00,260
being done on behalf of PQ Games.

2081
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:09,940
So some of the things that they had done to them, one, they had obtained a grant basically

2082
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:21,060
for, it was a grant for an unnamed diversity fund, and they obtained it in PQ Games behalf,

2083
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:23,380
but then they withheld the money from them.

2084
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:31,700
Then also, they had tried using those funds as part of a negotiation tactic with them.

2085
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:37,700
So rather than giving them the money, they were hiding the fact that the grant had been

2086
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:44,180
awarded to them and added as recoupable minimum guarantee, and then used it to negotiate the

2087
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:45,860
increase of their revenue share.

2088
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:52,500
Also, PQ Games is refusing to grant them control over publishing again.

2089
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:56,580
So unfortunately, the game's kind of in limbo right now.

2090
01:59:56,580 --> 02:00:02,420
But the company wants to make arrangements and ensure that it's published as intended

2091
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:05,540
in a way that's consistent with their community values.

2092
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:11,380
So yeah, that sounds like a lot of drama there.

2093
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:19,460
It says, the support has included offering a significant further funding over and above

2094
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:23,140
the grant funding to support development, importing, and marketing.

2095
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:29,860
This touch productions have sought for some time to unitally enforce the unreasonable

2096
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:36,420
revised terms of our agreement, and it's disappointing that as a result not achieving

2097
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:40,980
that, that despite PQ significant efforts to accommodate this, they have sought the

2098
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:43,060
deal with a matter this way.

2099
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:46,900
So basically, PQ is trying to say that, oh, we're not involved in that.

2100
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:51,780
Yeah, like, how dare they go public with this, you know, trying to make us look bad to try

2101
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:53,460
to resolve it this way, you know, in the

2102
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:58,100
sure that, yeah, it's in their best interest to, you know, small indies, it's in their

2103
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:03,940
best interest to try to piss off the publisher of their game, you know, and to try to throw

2104
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:07,140
them under the bus and shade them with untrue facts.

2105
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:08,820
I'm sure that's really what they're trying to do.

2106
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:10,580
Yeah, I don't think so.

2107
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:11,780
Okay.

2108
02:01:11,780 --> 02:01:16,820
So I think the developers have also said that if they did go forward with the publishing

2109
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:23,940
through PQ, it says, or it says, oh, yeah, apparently players, of course, have decided

2110
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:27,620
to review bomb PQ for doing stuff like that.

2111
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:30,260
So, all right.

2112
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:33,380
All right, well, we'll move on to our next story.

2113
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:38,420
Dark Sakura had to step away for just a moment, so she'll come back to her thing at another

2114
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:39,220
time.

2115
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:43,140
So we'll move on to this story, which actually, I'm sorry, is also from Loki.

2116
02:01:43,140 --> 02:01:44,500
We'll skip right back to you, Loki.

2117
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:45,700
All right, cool.

2118
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:52,980
So there's some leaked game, well, very brief gameplay from apparently a new Need for Speed

2119
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:54,660
title that has appeared online.

2120
02:01:55,300 --> 02:02:00,580
It has, well, I mean, they haven't really announced a new Need for Speed game, but apparently

2121
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:08,660
it shows some footage of a, a barrel, a Bel Air crashing into some sort of donut shaped

2122
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:11,460
monument and like some of the art style and stuff with that.

2123
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:17,940
They said that the new Need for Speed would kind of combine like, you know, of photorealistic

2124
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:21,060
and then like kind of, they say anime elements.

2125
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:27,220
It's sort of like kind of graffiti almost elements to it, I guess.

2126
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:28,820
It's neat.

2127
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:31,220
It's a neat, uh, art style, I guess.

2128
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:35,060
But, um, yeah, I don't know.

2129
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:38,980
I'll be interested to see when they fully announce it.

2130
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:40,100
It doesn't tell us much, right?

2131
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:41,300
Open world though.

2132
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:45,140
Like, I mean, the way they kind of make it look, it looks open world and I'm all about

2133
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:49,380
an open world, like raising a game, like, uh, whether it be Need for Speed, kind of like

2134
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:54,020
Need for Speed, I think underground was open world, but, um, whether it be like that or

2135
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:56,580
like Burnout Paradise or something like that, I'm all down for that.

2136
02:02:56,900 --> 02:03:01,860
Uh, I guess we'll have to wait and see whenever the hell they announce it.

2137
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:02,500
All right.

2138
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:02,900
We'll see.

2139
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:04,420
All right.

2140
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:08,580
And, uh, one more story for you tonight that is a little bit of a follow up to something

2141
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:09,940
we talked about last week.

2142
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:13,620
Um, last week I think Dark Soccer had brought up that unfortunately, um, a developer of

2143
02:03:13,620 --> 02:03:17,700
some games that were published on Steam had passed away and that was, um, Rob Hale and,

2144
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:22,740
uh, the games that, um, he had developed, Waves and Waves 2, uh, ended up being given

2145
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:27,860
away on Steam, uh, as kind of like a tribute, you know, basically a post post-mortem.

2146
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:32,660
Um, and, uh, the interesting thing that's happened as a result of that, that I wanted

2147
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:39,620
to bring up tonight is that, uh, now a lot of fans are through Steam and through the

2148
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:44,180
review system, leaving like basically positive review bombing.

2149
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:47,060
Although I wouldn't call it review bombing because usually that's done with the intent

2150
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:48,020
to alter the score.

2151
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:51,940
I would say this is coming from a much different place where people are leaving their thank

2152
02:03:51,940 --> 02:03:55,380
yous and their memories and so forth as, you know, Steam reviews.

2153
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:59,700
Uh, as of right now, Waves and Waves 2 have very positive ratings.

2154
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:03,780
Uh, and actually it should be noted they had those ratings before he passed too.

2155
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:08,900
So it should be clear this is not just a result of, uh, the game going free and so forth.

2156
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:14,820
Um, so, you know, a lot of people saying things like F-cancer, uh, RIP, you know, the typical

2157
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:18,580
things you would expect, um, to read, but, uh, yeah, just kind of interesting how that's

2158
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:22,340
sort of turned into a virtual memorial of sorts for the developer.

2159
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:26,260
Um, and, uh, you know, and I kind of talked about this last week on the show when, when

2160
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:30,420
Jamie originally brought up the story is it's one of those, you know, the, the art that

2161
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:34,100
you will leave behind and the lasting impact that it has on this world.

2162
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:39,540
Um, and it's, it's very clear that this gentleman, you know, put a lot into these games and now

2163
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:46,020
there's a lot of people that are appreciative and able to, um, you know, enjoy it, enjoy

2164
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:49,460
his work and, uh, have be impacted by art.

2165
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:55,700
It is unfortunate that he had to pass away for the game to get all the, um, you know,

2166
02:04:55,700 --> 02:04:57,540
traction and publicity that it has.

2167
02:04:58,100 --> 02:05:03,860
But, um, it's, it's, it's nice that at the end of the day, more people are able to play

2168
02:05:03,860 --> 02:05:06,980
it and, um, are, are feeling so positive about it.

2169
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:12,180
Um, this pod culture says in chat review boosting, I wouldn't even, you know, again, you, you,

2170
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:16,900
yes, but no, you know, those terms are usually reserved for artificial types of things.

2171
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:20,340
Um, and I, again, I think what we're talking about tonight is very organic.

2172
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:24,660
Um, so you're, you're not wrong, but also I just, I just don't like using those labels

2173
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:30,260
that typically go for things like, you know, like Amazon sellers paying you to boost reviews

2174
02:05:30,260 --> 02:05:30,820
and stuff like that.

2175
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:32,660
This is obviously from a much different place.

2176
02:05:32,660 --> 02:05:36,820
Um, and I thought it was just a nice little follow-up, uh, and a reminder, if you haven't

2177
02:05:36,820 --> 02:05:41,940
picked up waves or waves to Nash chance, they're free on steam.

2178
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:43,060
All right.

2179
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:48,180
With that, we move into the listener round table tonight, and we welcome your calls over

2180
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:50,900
at vog network.com slash discord.

2181
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:53,780
Uh, you can join the green room if you'd like to be on the show tonight and we'll get to

2182
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:54,820
some of your calls.

2183
02:05:54,820 --> 02:06:00,580
We would usually also get to your emails, but I believe we don't have any tonight.

2184
02:06:00,580 --> 02:06:03,380
At least last I checked, we didn't have any emails.

2185
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:05,380
So let's say, that's what I thought.

2186
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:08,740
So, uh, participate at orange laundry.com.

2187
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:12,100
If you want to send us an email for a future week.

2188
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:17,540
Uh, meanwhile, I will mention on Twitter because there's a, I know there was a follow-up to

2189
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:21,140
last week's email because Ziba tweeted, I don't remember.

2190
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:23,140
She just tweeted at me or she tweeted the OLR account.

2191
02:06:23,140 --> 02:06:25,060
She might've just tweeted it at me, but I'm going to repeat it.

2192
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:30,260
Anyway, that presentation of clue that's happening in final fantasy is getting delayed.

2193
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:32,020
They had to push it back a week.

2194
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:35,060
So now I really can't see it because I'm going to be at dragon con.

2195
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:36,900
It was supposed to be this last Saturday.

2196
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:42,180
They pushed it back a week because the island sanctuary is so popular.

2197
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:47,380
It's been hosing the servers and people are having problems getting into the housing wards.

2198
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:52,900
So, uh, it's not like, it's not as bad as some of the server problems they've had, but

2199
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:57,860
I think the people putting on this play kind of knew it's just going to make a bad situation

2200
02:06:57,860 --> 02:06:59,540
worse if we overdo that.

2201
02:06:59,540 --> 02:07:00,980
So they pushed it out a week.

2202
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:04,580
So unfortunately I will have to wait and see the YouTube for that, um, which I really hope

2203
02:07:04,580 --> 02:07:07,700
somebody puts on YouTube or at least a VOD or something like that.

2204
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:09,380
Cause I'd really love to see that.

2205
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:11,780
At some point it sounds really cool.

2206
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:15,700
So, um, but that's it for emails and tweets.

2207
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:19,540
Um, but let me go to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories tonight.

2208
02:07:19,540 --> 02:07:23,220
Maybe I did have one thing that's just a fun little mention.

2209
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:28,980
So there is a brand new mod for Spiderman for PC.

2210
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:30,500
Cause you gotta love those Spiderman.

2211
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:34,500
Oh no, not after last week, but I, if you're bringing it up, then this one's got to be

2212
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:36,260
better than the tone from last week.

2213
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:38,420
It allows you to play as Kermit the Frog.

2214
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:42,740
And it looks amazing.

2215
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:45,380
To which I would say, yay!

2216
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:48,740
Time for the flail.

2217
02:07:52,580 --> 02:07:56,020
As the show on her mountain chat says, yes, that mod is amazing.

2218
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:56,420
So yes.

2219
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:59,860
Questbuster chat says your friendly neighborhood frog.

2220
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:00,360
Yes.

2221
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:07,640
They, then there's of course other ridiculously borderline offensive mods where like, it's

2222
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:12,440
not like offensive bad, like kind of like really, uh, where someone has modded uncle

2223
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:16,600
Ben's gravestone as your playable character and it's remastered.

2224
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:19,160
It's just stupid.

2225
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:24,920
It's yeah, it's probably in poor taste, but a very different type of poor taste than what

2226
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:26,280
we were talking about last week.

2227
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:28,680
So the current, the frog though, that's, that's hilarious.

2228
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:29,880
Yeah, no, I love that.

2229
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:33,640
That's, that's, that's the absurdest shit that mods are for.

2230
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:34,760
Thank you very much.

2231
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:35,480
Me, Kermit.

2232
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:41,640
I can't, I couldn't help but start thinking of the, uh, sense of me a street.

2233
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:43,160
Listen, frog.

2234
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:45,020
Kermit!

2235
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:47,560
And the number R.

2236
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:53,560
Um, oh, S2100Matt had said something about this to me on Twitter.

2237
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:57,240
Since we didn't get emails tonight, we can do drag race talk and believe it.

2238
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:59,640
S2100Matt is bringing up drag race.

2239
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:06,760
So SSJ100Matt says, speaking of drag race, Sarah Nurse, who is a Canadian hockey star

2240
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:13,160
and is a guest judge on Canadian drag race is now the first woman to be on an NHL game

2241
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:15,240
cover with another player.

2242
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:21,000
Well, we're going to give the gold star of the night to SSJ100Matt for being the first

2243
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:26,120
listener in recent memory anyway, that has successfully connected drag race to video

2244
02:09:26,120 --> 02:09:26,840
games.

2245
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:27,720
Thank you.

2246
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:32,680
And actually made drag race a relevant topic of discussion here on Orange Lawn's radio.

2247
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:33,800
Kudos to you.

2248
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:35,080
I will take a step back though.

2249
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:37,400
And there was the drag queen fighting game that we brought up.

2250
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:37,880
There was.

2251
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:41,880
That's why I said in recent memory and not that a listener brought up.

2252
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:43,560
And hockey and hockey and hockey.

2253
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:44,040
That's true.

2254
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:44,680
That's true.

2255
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:45,240
You've tied all this.

2256
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:52,440
So though I can tell you now that it's been a week out, uh, for celebrity drag race.

2257
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:56,120
I didn't watch this last episode yet, but I was shook last week.

2258
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,760
Because you know who it was?

2259
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:00,200
I, I heard.

2260
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:00,360
Yeah.

2261
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:02,440
Well, I haven't watched, but I get spoiled on Twitter.

2262
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,040
So I can say it.

2263
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:04,280
Sure.

2264
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:04,680
Why not?

2265
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:06,600
It was Taylor Dane.

2266
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:08,040
I'm like, Holy shit.

2267
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:11,160
I had a feeling it was, it was like a nineties singer.

2268
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:14,840
It's like that the voice she carries herself, that could be Taylor Dane.

2269
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:17,880
And I was like, Oh, although I know who a few of the others are.

2270
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:20,920
So I'm just saying, I'm pretty sure I know who they are.

2271
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:21,160
Taylor.

2272
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:22,680
Day was on the mass singer recently too.

2273
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:23,640
She didn't win.

2274
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:28,520
But, um, it's nice to see her making a comeback of sorts on all these C-list reality shows.

2275
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:33,720
Cause I always wondered like she was, she was huge in the nineties and like disappeared.

2276
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:35,640
Um, what?

2277
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:36,920
I had to do a sad thing though.

2278
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:39,160
I had to tell Elsie who new kids on the block were.

2279
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:40,440
Oh no.

2280
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:43,480
Oh, kids today.

2281
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:45,160
Kids today.

2282
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:52,200
But I love, I love Taylor Dane.

2283
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:56,920
And if you've never heard the comic, um, and she's on star Trek too.

2284
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:59,320
Randomly, Tig Notaro, you probably know who she is.

2285
02:10:59,320 --> 02:10:59,720
You know her.

2286
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:06,120
If you saw her very famous, um, lesbian comic has this whole routine around Taylor Dane.

2287
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:06,840
That's great.

2288
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:08,760
And it's on YouTube and it's definitely worth a listen.

2289
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:10,840
Oh, Rob, tell it to my heart.

2290
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,480
Tell it I'm the only one.

2291
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:17,960
Is this really love or is it, is it just a game?

2292
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:18,520
Just a game.

2293
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:23,640
We, when I was, gosh, was I in early high school?

2294
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:24,280
Hold on, hold on.

2295
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:24,680
Loki.

2296
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:25,800
Do you know who Taylor Dana is?

2297
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:32,440
Love will lead you back someday.

2298
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:37,480
I just know that love will lead you back to my heart.

2299
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:39,080
Yes.

2300
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:39,560
Okay.

2301
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:40,440
Taylor Dane, you ain't.

2302
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:41,560
No, I'm not.

2303
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:46,360
Can you believe I don't play karaoke games on stream?

2304
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:54,600
I remember the one time I asked you to sing something at karaoke and I forgot that.

2305
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:56,920
I didn't realize that it wasn't quite in your range.

2306
02:11:57,480 --> 02:12:01,400
I forgot how much that, uh, bird house in your soul has a weird key.

2307
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:01,800
Oh yeah.

2308
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:02,600
It doesn't have a weird key.

2309
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:03,000
Yeah.

2310
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:08,600
That was the last song I ever asked you to sing karaoke for me, uh, faces before they

2311
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:14,360
started getting, you know, I, I, my go to, um, karaoke songs.

2312
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,160
Are hand in my pocket by Alanis Morissette.

2313
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:19,480
And I can pretty much see anything off a jagged little pill.

2314
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:22,200
And I don't even need the words on the screen, uh, or ABBA.

2315
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:25,400
What can I, what can I say?

2316
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:31,960
Mine are band on the run by Paul McCartney and wings, but I love that song.

2317
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:32,520
This is fun.

2318
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:33,800
It's like three songs in one.

2319
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,720
And, um, yeah.

2320
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:43,160
And, um, she's trapped in here with me or am I trapped in here with her?

2321
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:47,560
But, um, also, uh, lady fingers by Luscious Jackson.

2322
02:12:47,560 --> 02:12:48,280
Oh, that's a good song.

2323
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:49,320
I love that song.

2324
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:49,960
Yeah.

2325
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:51,480
Those are like my big two.

2326
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:59,880
Although I was in my car, I made myself a nineties, uh, girl playlist and I was belting

2327
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:02,040
out crucify today and that might become my new song.

2328
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:03,400
All right.

2329
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:04,440
I love Tori Amos.

2330
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:12,120
Cause you know, she was the, the, uh, tree in, uh, starstruck the beginning in the book.

2331
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:13,800
She was the tree.

2332
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:15,400
All right.

2333
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:21,080
Well on those completely random tangent notes, let's go ahead and end this where it began

2334
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:21,960
with tangents.

2335
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:25,640
Uh, but before we get to our final thoughts, I want to say thank you as always for listening

2336
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:26,760
to orange launch radio.

2337
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:30,040
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, or even if you didn't, you could still help

2338
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:32,120

2339
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:35,240
So, uh, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the

2340
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:37,080
show where every gamer has a voice and dang it.

2341
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:39,160
We need more voices here on Sunday night.

2342
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:43,480
Uh, we love the ones we have, including Michigan's mom, who is the biggest Taylor

2343
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:44,200
Dane fan.

2344
02:13:44,200 --> 02:13:45,560
Well, well welcome.

2345
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:47,720
Uh, you can get, you're in good company.

2346
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:49,880
We love Taylor day, uh, even Loki.

2347
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:52,920
So, uh, but help us expand our live audience.

2348
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:54,760
Uh, tell a friend or two about the show.

2349
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,120
Uh, podcast is great too.

2350
02:13:56,120 --> 02:13:57,640
A nice five star review.

2351
02:13:57,640 --> 02:14:01,880
Uh, we love our podcast listeners, a nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, wherever

2352
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:03,800
it is you found this show, those go an awful long way.

2353
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,800
So we really appreciate those as well.

2354
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:06,280
All right.

2355
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:11,800
We will be back in two weeks, even though the sidebar says next week, I will be here

2356
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:12,280
next week.

2357
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:13,880
I mean, dark soccer might be streaming.

2358
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:14,840
Loki might be streaming.

2359
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:16,280
I don't know, but we will be streaming.

2360
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:23,000
I will be doing, uh, I talked to, to finara and we're, we are going to be doing swifts.

2361
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:27,640
We will invite anyone who wants to play a dead by daylight with us swell.

2362
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:35,240
Um, at, at Showtime, which is free on PlayStation pluses, uh, thing right now, if, if you have

2363
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:36,280
that and need the game.

2364
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:41,240
So there's a lot of weight and you need a meat shield will be your meat shield.

2365
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:41,560
All right.

2366
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:42,520
There you go.

2367
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:45,320
Um, that's, that's, uh, that's it.

2368
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:46,920
Uh, let's, let's wrap up.

2369
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:48,360
We'll see you again in two weeks.

2370
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:49,400
Let's get final thoughts.

2371
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:50,200
Uh, dark soccer.

2372
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:52,360
I will start with you cause I know you are going to go stream here in a moment.

2373
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:58,680
So they released the patch notes coming up for the new chapter and everything.

2374
02:14:58,680 --> 02:15:01,640
And I still don't think that's going to stop the camping and tunneling situation.

2375
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:05,080
They just need to make it to where the struggle timer stops.

2376
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:09,560
Uh, in relation to proximity of killer to hook in the story.

2377
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:10,060
I agree.

2378
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:11,740
All right.

2379
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:13,080
Have a good one.

2380
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:15,320
Happy surviving later tater.

2381
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:15,960
All right.

2382
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:18,280
And let's go to Loki and your final thought tonight.

2383
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,720
Uh, I'm hoping to get an episode out this week.

2384
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:22,920
It's been a while.

2385
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:26,200
It's been a few weeks, but that's because I'm building a very large build.

2386
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,880
It is the large it's large.

2387
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:30,680
It's very large.

2388
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:35,400
Uh, my final thought is I cannot wait for dragon con.

2389
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,480
I'm so excited to be back home.

2390
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:40,200
I know it's going to be another kind of kind of weird year.

2391
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:42,680
Last year was a really weird year, but I still had a lot of fun.

2392
02:15:42,680 --> 02:15:44,600
This year is going to be kind of a weird year.

2393
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:47,720
But we're, we're slowly getting back to what it used to be.

2394
02:15:47,720 --> 02:15:50,680
I hope everybody has a great and safe dragon con.

2395
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:51,880
Can't wait to meet people.

2396
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:53,720
And I hope whatever you're doing labor day weekend.

2397
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:57,640
I know I won't shut up about dragon con cause that's what I do, but whatever you do during

2398
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:59,480
labor day weekend, I hope you have a good one.

2399
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:00,520
I hope you have a lot of fun.

2400
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:02,440
Stay safe.

2401
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:06,520
And if nothing else, tell it to my heart.

2402
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:09,000
Tell it I'm the only one.

2403
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,720
Is this really love or just a game?

2404
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:15,160
