0	28000	Some people know of the very early Internet meme All Your Bass. Some of those people know that the game's sequence footage and translation text comes from a game called Zero Wing. But what everyone should know is that whether or not you've played it already, soon many more people will have a remastered version of it to play, including other titles by developer Toaplan. Sign me up.
28000	37440	This is just one internet trend generating story. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37440	66440	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 927 of our show for this August the 21st of 2022. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined every week by my co hosts say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66440	72440	I'd better be the only I don't know maybe there's a DarkSakura out there in Michigan somewhere.
72440	101440	There actually was an evil Sakura for a while. And she actually dated Chris Tang, which is how I met him because I knew her. And the two of them came over, and he brought a like a CPS two unit for playing a Street Fighter and whatnot. And we played Bust to Move. That was how I learned about the game.
102440	107440	But um, but no, I was I was dark first. There's I was back before Capcom did it.
108440	131440	There's lots of Rob Roberts out there. There's I think once a rugby player, one owns a gun shop or something. If you look it up on if you look up Rob Roberts on YouTube, you get a gun person bunch of gun videos, which is like totally not me. And then I think there's a there's a politician in the UK who did a lot of shitty things from what I understand. So I've I've not haven't really followed it. But I'm like, Oh, great. I'm gonna get confused with that guy. So
131440	153440	so to point this out, there was, you know, Jamie Summers was spelled J. A. I. M. E. S. O. M. M. E. R. S. and that was a bionic woman. So I truly was named after. But there's, but I spell my J. A. M. I. E. S. U. M. M. E. R. S. because it's different. And there's also a porn star who does that. Of course, of course, of course, there's always a porn star.
154440	155980	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
157680	160160	My but my unmarried name.
161780	162680	Also,
164000	164920	matched
165160	167640	something. You know, you got to be careful because you want to give it away.
168200	171120	A friend's a former friend.
171160	174120	Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. I remember that.
174160	183420	He was spelled J. A. I. M. E. M. M. E. And for about a year, even after they broke up, and while they were together, I got his mail.
184200	187760	And he would get some of mine, which is very interesting.
188000	190360	So, all right.
190520	192720	Also, say hello to the one and only.
192720	193960	There is no other.
193960	198800	Loki never, there is never heard that name used before anywhere.
198840	201000	No, no, it's completely original.
201760	203200	How are you doing, Loki?
203200	206720	I mean, licensing my properties, make TV shows and stuff, of course.
206720	212360	So. Well, I but the thing is, most people would probably assume
212360	215720	that you're Loki after the Marvel Loki and you're not.
215760	218400	Yeah. And I embrace both. It's fine.
218560	220600	Yeah, that's that's good. That's good.
220600	223600	So the same thing with the Street Fighter character.
224600	229760	Oh, yeah. Although now people think it's from Naruto, but.
231200	233600	Well, no, I cosplayed.
233600	235680	No, actually, I didn't cosplay her. I cosplayed Tamari.
236320	239680	Well, when it comes to video games and people that have been doing
239680	243760	an online radio broadcast and podcast for way too long,
243760	247200	we really are the one and only Rob Robert, star soccer and Loki.
247200	249400	Get used to it. All right.
250640	252200	We got a lot in store for tonight.
252200	253720	A lot of gaming news to get into.
253720	256680	Let's why don't we just get right into our kickoff topic for tonight,
256680	260440	which is a story that has been making the rounds quite a bit this week.
260960	261920	Do you want to get into this, Loki?
261920	263520	You want me to tackle this?
263520	265040	Because I got a lot to say about it, but.
266000	268160	I mean, yeah, if you want to get into it, it's fine.
268400	270280	OK, there's not much to it.
270280	273600	So Spider-Man Remastered just came out on PC.
273600	277040	So, you know, a lot of the Sony games are getting their PC releases. Right.
277040	279880	So Spider-Man Remastered, of course, one of the big
279880	283200	releases of the PlayStation four and five era. Right.
283880	287400	So this has been a long awaited release on PC. And what does it mean?
287600	291800	What is the big thing that happens when a game releases on PC
292120	294960	from console that it didn't get on console, it gets on PC?
294960	296880	Why do a lot of people want it on PC?
296880	300080	Modding, mods, mods, mods. That's right.
300080	301520	All the mods you can think of.
301520	305120	And, you know, every everything you can think of was done in this game as well.
305120	308280	You know, especially the quote unquote obvious things.
308280	311240	Things like alternate Spider-Man skins.
311280	314440	You want to make Spider-Man look like Miles Morales Spider-Man.
314440	317040	Yes, of course, you can do that through mods and so on and so on.
317280	319880	So with mods, the possibilities are endless.
320400	324480	But I think you some of you that follow gaming culture
324480	327600	and gaming social media, you probably know exactly what's coming up next.
328200	334280	So on August 15th, a user on Nexus mods by the name of Mike Hawk.
335240	337800	Because the year is 1989,
337800	341360	and this is a phone call on The Simpsons to Moe's Tavern, clearly.
342120	348840	Mike Hawk on Nexus uploaded a mod for Spider-Man Remastered
348840	353400	that replaces Newton's prism artifacts
353400	354800	with the stars and stripes.
354800	356560	That's what the description said.
356560	359560	That was its way of getting around keywords to basically say
359560	364360	it took all of the rainbow flags that because the Spider-Man
364360	366960	remaster game has a very accurate depiction of New York City
366960	369720	and you know, the big diversity that you see in New York City.
370080	374920	And it replaced the rainbow flag or the pride flags with American flags.
375440	376840	Of which there are plenty.
376840	378960	Of which there were, which already existed.
378960	380600	Thank you for clarifying that, because that's important.
380600	382680	Which already existed in the game.
382680	388320	So long story short, I'm sure you were never expecting Mike Hawk
388600	391920	to do this type of juvenile stuff online.
391920	393240	But there you go.
393240	397760	And this, of course, as you can imagine, opened up a big old can of worms,
397760	401160	because obviously, you know, it's interesting
401160	405760	because there's a lot of times with mods we ask ourselves, what's the point?
406280	410280	Like, you know, when it's like, you know, nudie mods and what's the point?
410520	413680	You know, and a lot of times it's because we can.
414200	416560	But with this one, no, really.
417040	419520	What's the point of doing this?
420080	424600	And a lot of people are saying it's hate.
424680	427840	It's erasure. It's ridiculous.
429280	432320	Nexus mods was kind of forced to intervene, as you can imagine.
432640	436000	They had to quickly remove the mod and banned the creator.
436600	440640	And they found that the creator had made a sock puppet account to do this.
440640	445000	And Nexus mods in a blog post said the fact that the user needed to make
445000	450280	a sock puppet like a coward to upload the mod showed their intent to troll.
450760	453800	The creation of the sock puppet removed any doubt and made it
453800	455720	a very easy decision for us.
455720	460160	Both of the sock puppet account and the user's main account have been banned.
460920	464720	Of course, we're saying that if if he had done it on his main account,
464760	466720	he would have just gotten a warning
466720	470400	and had the mod taken down and then banned if it went back up. Right.
470440	472400	But it was very clear.
472400	475160	I love that they minced no words, especially
475440	477920	if this doesn't suit your morality.
477920	480080	Here's how to delete your account.
480080	480920	That would. Yeah.
480920	482640	Nexus mods. Beautiful.
482640	484680	I'm a fan of zero fucks.
484680	491040	Alan uses Alan mods games a lot, and he is a heavy user of Nexus mods.
491040	493520	And I support that 100 percent.
494000	497560	You remember how my Mass Effect 3 looked because I downloaded
497560	501000	the high res mods and my Dragon Age mods and all of that.
501440	504280	Unfortunately, once on the Internet, always on the Internet.
504280	507720	And so the mods out there, we know that it was on the Internet
507720	510680	archive at one point, but I think that it got pulled from there, too.
510680	512480	But, you know, it's it's it's out there.
512480	515840	It's that people put a lot of modding sites took it down.
516040	519360	Unfortunately, because of a lot of this controversy.
519360	522840	Now that just makes people want to install it more, you know,
522840	524520	because people want to be edgy.
524520	527800	And in their comments on Twitter, they like to talk about,
528040	533280	oh, the snowflakes are triggered because we were moved their pride flags.
533280	536120	And they're they hate America.
536320	540480	They hate America because they can't stand to see the American flag.
541480	543920	I have a different take on that.
543920	547360	You see, you are using the American flag
547360	551040	in this mod for your act of coward, cowardice.
551360	554440	You are hiding behind the American flag
554440	559560	and you are allowing the American flag to be a symbol of cowardice.
559960	561760	That is what you're doing.
561760	564840	You are being offensive towards this American flag symbol.
564840	568320	I mean, we all know this argument is absolutely ridiculous.
568320	569840	It's absolutely ridiculous.
569840	573080	It's like putting a child in a shirt that says fuck you
573240	575560	and then sending that child to Disneyland and then going,
575680	579040	why would Disney kick a child out of Disneyland?
579200	580440	I don't understand.
580440	582800	Why does Disney hate children?
582800	586960	Or in another wonderful Internet brainchild moment,
587120	590760	it's like going into a PetSmart and yelling at the employees about
590760	594320	why do they have pride stuff up at a PetSmart
594440	599280	and why does PetSmart support all this bullshit that people want to tie
599280	602360	to LGBT stuff like pedophilia and all this garbage.
602360	605000	Stop making my frogs gay, damn it.
605000	606040	Damn you, PetSmart.
606040	608520	They did witness a rant like that once.
608520	610440	No, I know. That's why I specifically called that out.
610440	613080	But the employee was awesome.
613120	614720	Oh, no. Yeah, they were awesome.
614720	618320	And like. No, you weren't there for this.
618440	621400	This is. Oh, this is an Alabama PetSmart.
621440	623320	Oh, I'm talking about the PetSmart video I saw.
623320	624360	Sorry. Go ahead. No, no, no.
624360	626840	I'm talking about when I personally witnessed. Oh, OK.
627360	630680	And the the person's going off, this is God.
631960	634920	And employees like, here's the corporate address.
634920	637440	Talk to them. I'm on my break.
637440	640800	I don't get people like it's just like
641640	642640	just who cares?
642640	645440	Like like if it bothers you, just whatever you like.
645760	649480	It's not that being included in the game is not really.
650000	651640	What's it doing to you?
651640	652840	Like, stop.
652840	655440	I think their take are these types of people.
655440	657960	Their take is like they're shoving it down my throat.
658560	663160	Well, yeah, but like because, of course, it's all projection
663160	666280	and typically the projection of this stuff that they're doing.
666280	669840	I mean, like you're shoving that super American pride down
669840	671640	to everybody's throats as well.
671640	672520	Not that it's right.
672520	674960	It's really just bigotry, but, you know, whatever you want to call it.
676000	677520	I mean, it's the same thing.
677520	679720	It's just. I don't know.
679720	681240	Like put it this way.
681240	685560	It's like trans, you know, gay, straight.
685560	689120	I mean, well, pretty much anyone non-binary.
689120	692320	I mean, they're not like trying to come after you.
692440	695440	I mean, they're just trying to live their damn lives and just. Yeah.
695640	700200	You know, exist and maybe get the same type of freedoms
700200	701720	and rights as everybody else.
701720	706640	And God forbid, you know, everybody's like, well, the Bible says like,
706640	711080	as that's the only, you know, dictator of everything in the world.
711080	711840	You know, of course.
711840	715040	Royale says that I can get trapped on an island and kill my schoolmates.
716720	718520	That's a big book.
719200	722480	It's it's technically both both are technically books.
723040	726320	And correct. Both are books.
727280	730240	You know, if I if I learn how to,
730680	733480	you know, shoot an arrow through 10 holes,
733680	737120	then I can get a hot Greek wife named Penelope.
737880	741880	I'm I am happy to let Loki continue his rant here.
741880	743800	I am happy to let an ally
745520	747200	say it the way it needs to be heard.
747200	751640	Like, it's so stupid, like just the the downright evil stuff
751640	755960	that like certain spectrums of the political,
755960	758680	I guess, you know, the Republicans, we're just going to say it.
759760	762880	They just going after people like in their basic rights
762880	767160	and trying to strip them away from them, thinking that, oh, you know, save us.
767160	769040	Oh, they're trying to teach our kids to be gay.
769040	771960	They're trying to teach our kids to change their genders like.
773040	774080	No, they're not.
774080	777120	But these are the same people that are saying, you know, like, oh, hey, rock
777120	779040	music's trying to make you worship the devil.
779040	781920	Oh, hey, your comic books are trying to, you know.
783240	786120	Corrupt your mind and also worship the devil, I'm sure.
786160	788760	I mean, it's just
788760	790600	when will these people just die?
790600	792840	When will they just die off already?
792840	794760	Like, come on.
794760	797440	It all comes down to control, though. Control and money.
797640	799640	It is. It actually is.
799640	802640	It's it's controlling the narrative, which is exactly what they're trying
802640	804800	to do in this situation, because they're turning this,
804800	808000	you know, shutting down of pride flags and the pride movement into
808040	809200	why do you hate America?
809200	810280	That's exactly what it is.
810280	814160	And it's this whole it's it's the whole, you know, what?
814320	817680	Why do you keep shoving that gay shit down my throat,
817840	821320	says individual walking into a pet smart, holding a camera,
821320	823880	trying to live for a matter of black lives.
823880	827440	My counter to them is why do you hate America?
828280	829680	Thank you. Thank you.
829680	832960	Because that's exactly what it is, because when you're using the American flag
832960	836000	to to hide your cowardness behind,
836240	839080	you are the ones who are the ball lickers
839680	843360	or the people with the, you know, to quote, it's basically
844280	846840	butchering the American flag to put the blue line on it.
848680	852040	You know, yeah, it's this, but no,
852160	856560	it isn't necessarily to control the narrative as well, especially,
856560	859400	you know, anyone with a uterus knows this very well,
859960	863640	is that it goes to controlling people.
864520	868880	To have a population that will support their interests
869480	872480	so that they can remain in power.
873320	877960	Women, I'm just going to use women in general right now, just loose term.
879200	884400	For example, yeah, we do have a lot more going for us now than we did.
884400	890000	And we are kind of taking over a lot of things.
890240	894000	And this has been considered male dominated territory.
894200	898960	Well, same thing is also going on with, quote, heterosexual territory
899640	904240	that and it's not that there are suddenly magically more gay,
904240	906600	more trans, more ace, whatever people.
906880	911160	The fact that the people are not hiding that anymore.
911800	914560	And and and, you know,
915400	917920	they want to go back
917920	922440	to an era where their type was in control
922440	926800	and they weren't the ones dying out and losing their control.
927880	930120	That's all that it is.
930120	933720	It's exactly why they remove certain pieces
933720	936440	of education from school curriculums, for example.
938120	941160	Think back to in terms I'm going to say like dark ages,
941960	948080	that general era where the only people who were educated were rich males.
950080	953880	Even women were rich, women were rarely educated
954280	959280	and the the general populace, if they didn't have money, they can get educated.
959280	960800	They were going to work
960800	965320	because an educated population is something those in power fear.
966240	969800	Yeah, that's why they're trying to promote non education, like even now
969800	972960	they have, was it in Florida where they pass the bill where they can
973240	977440	let just untrained veterans teach children now, which is fine.
977440	980040	You know, like, I'm sure those people are nice, but.
981320	985680	They're not teachers, they haven't gone through the training to do that, like.
986640	989520	Well, and the other thing, too, though, is that, you know,
990000	993640	what does it say, the the the victors write the history?
994880	997320	Oh, no, history is written by the victors, that's the phrase.
997760	1004600	And they are teaching these these revisionist histories in school, which is.
1005480	1009640	Like, if I didn't have teachers that were really open minded and said,
1009640	1012400	no, what your your book says is wrong, this is what happened.
1013800	1016400	Then I might not be the thinker that I am today.
1016880	1021760	And this is something, you know, especially then with a lot of
1021760	1023520	I'm going to throw Internet culture in on this, too,
1023520	1026200	because it's also a big factor in this matter,
1026680	1031360	is when you've got people spreading a false narrative and passing on,
1031840	1038240	you know, hearsay and oh, so and so said this, it must be true.
1038240	1040560	Or I heard, I heard, I heard.
1040560	1043120	Or this tribal knowledge, for lack of a better description,
1044360	1049160	as fact, when indeed it's not necessarily fact, it's half truths.
1049960	1055520	But it's just enough out there to be detrimental
1055520	1059040	to the growth of society in general and create these.
1060520	1063640	Pockets of hatred, if you know what I mean.
1064560	1066920	Whereas someone who is who's educated,
1066920	1070720	who's been at an experience that, hey, no, it's not really like this.
1071680	1075840	They should be speaking up and going, no, no, you're completely wrong.
1076440	1080200	You know, I had another point that I was going to make,
1080200	1082040	but right now I'm too disgusted.
1082040	1084520	If I could quickly, I want to acknowledge our live chat,
1084520	1087680	because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern,
1087680	1090200	six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv
1090200	1091280	slash Avog Network.
1091280	1092400	And you can chat along.
1092400	1094800	And a great part of the show and why we do this
1094800	1097080	is that you all get to have your voices heard in chat
1097560	1100040	or solicited through email and Twitter throughout the week.
1100600	1102440	And we have a lot of great comments in chat,
1102440	1104720	just a lot of support for what's being said here.
1104720	1106080	And, you know, thank you. I appreciate it.
1106080	1108360	Because, you know, I've heard I've certainly heard over the years
1108960	1113520	people who are on the political ideology spectrum different than we are.
1113520	1117840	And there comes a point like I do try to understand, I do try to listen.
1117840	1120480	I try to educate and not attack. I really do.
1120800	1124840	But there comes a point and especially after doing this for 20 years,
1124840	1126680	you know, we've done this show for now 20 years.
1126680	1129080	We've we've by far hit that point where it's like
1129320	1132160	I am too old and I am too tired for this bullshit.
1132160	1136760	And when it is my identity being attacked, which is what this is.
1137000	1138680	This is what this is.
1138680	1141840	And using an American flag to hide behind that attack.
1142040	1143880	Yeah, I'm fucking pissed off.
1143880	1145680	And yeah, I'm going to talk about it.
1145680	1149160	And no, I'm not going to shut my mouth because you have a problem with it,
1149160	1151920	because, you know, deep down, I'm right.
1153960	1156120	What I'm going to do real quick in chat,
1156120	1158400	and I'm sorry about this to our listeners,
1158400	1161080	to listeners, you owe it to yourself to go look this up,
1161480	1164200	is I am putting up a list of logical fallacies.
1164560	1168360	Mm hmm. How to spot a logical fallacy in an argument,
1168760	1173640	because a lot of these people who are doing religion
1173640	1176480	or society or this, that and the other is their excuses.
1176760	1179040	They're logical fallacies.
1179040	1181000	It's like saying, oh,
1182760	1186840	this person with sunglasses caused a car accident.
1186840	1189440	I guess we need to ban sunglasses.
1189440	1190880	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1190880	1193520	You know, or yeah.
1193520	1197800	And and I think the thing I hear all the time,
1198240	1201680	I'm OK with gay people as long as they don't hit on me.
1203080	1204920	Why would someone hit on you
1204920	1208560	on behalf of your token gay friend in your circle or whatever?
1208720	1211320	Allow me allow me to say this.
1211320	1213800	Don't flatter yourself.
1213800	1216840	Period. Or or or this one, too.
1217160	1219680	You know what, what?
1219680	1222400	And I'm assuming that the person saying this would be male,
1222400	1224600	because I hear that more often.
1224600	1228160	What if what if your lady friend tried to hit on you?
1230120	1232880	It'd be exactly the same thing if you're not into her.
1232880	1236880	You say no. End of story.
1238000	1240640	It would probably be the only time that individual got hit on by a lady.
1240640	1243680	Anyway, I'm not going to go there. All right.
1243680	1245720	Well, now I'm being cheap.
1245720	1248200	I'm going below the bell. That's not nice.
1248200	1250480	I remember one of my uncles was like,
1251280	1255440	they better not come anywhere near me or I'd like Uncle Wayne.
1255480	1258000	No one wants to be around you, not even your family.
1259680	1264080	Yeah, I said that that was actually the last time I spoke to my uncle.
1265080	1268040	Pod culture and chat says, hell, I would be flattered.
1268120	1272880	Nobody wants to hit on me that it's very easy to say, oh, thank you.
1273120	1275560	I'm not interested, but I appreciate that compliment.
1275880	1277440	Wow. How hard was that?
1277440	1281520	There's an episode of Sailor Moon in Japan. Yeah.
1282160	1285600	Where this one girl has like a little crush on Usagi.
1286080	1289840	And Usagi very gently turns her down and says,
1289840	1293240	but let's be let's be friends and mean it, you know. Yeah.
1294240	1296200	It's that right there.
1296200	1300480	I mean, yeah, it's a show for, you know, for preteen girls.
1300480	1302880	Mostly that was the target age group.
1303560	1307000	But to put it so simply and easily there.
1308200	1311640	That's it. Or that other meme that goes around from Deep Space Nine
1312160	1314640	of of Curzon and Jadzia.
1315760	1319560	He goes, not Curzon, Curzon was her previous life.
1320360	1324480	Gauran is saying, it's like, Curzon, my old friend.
1324720	1326200	He goes, oh, I'm Jadzia now.
1326200	1327800	Oh, Jadzia, my old friend.
1327800	1331040	You know that like I love that scene.
1331040	1332680	I fucking love Deep Space Nine anyway.
1332680	1336800	But but I mean, it can be that easy.
1337600	1339920	Just love people.
1340440	1343440	You know, I mean, I don't love those people, but I'm saying.
1344600	1348160	Be just be a good person, you know, just
1349040	1351880	stop trying to inflict your world view on other people.
1351920	1355040	Now, I back to the golden rule, the Internet, don't be a dick.
1355680	1358400	I'm going to go, though, into one little piece of psychology,
1358400	1362240	and there is something about what's considered a core belief.
1363480	1368280	And these are, you know, like for the people that you introduce
1368280	1373240	proof of something that shakes a formative thought, a formative belief.
1374440	1378480	Then it actually does cause like a
1379040	1382200	sort of a psychological.
1382200	1384360	Thing, I can't really explain that.
1384360	1388400	I mean, this word seizure comes to mind, but it's not that just sort of like
1388400	1394680	a momentary shutdown because it goes against an ingrained
1394680	1397040	core belief, something that makes them who they are.
1397040	1399800	So in from a psychological standpoint, yes, I understand
1400240	1403440	the change is very difficult and it takes a very long time.
1403720	1407920	And you have to be able to recognize that you could be wrong
1408480	1410800	and be willing to make the change. Yeah.
1411400	1417360	But when you have an entire group of people with this core belief,
1417360	1418400	and I'm going to say it right now,
1418400	1421320	the Southern Baptist Church is a cult. I grew up in it.
1422760	1428280	But when you have when you have that going on,
1428680	1433000	you need to work on the narrative around it
1433000	1437920	and bring it into their purview in such a way
1438920	1445320	that it's going to start shifting that core thought, that core value.
1445720	1447720	It's not going to happen all at once.
1447720	1451120	As much as people want to say, as much as people think a big debate
1451120	1454240	is going to go on, it's going to have to happen gradually.
1454240	1458400	And on a societal level is something that Loki brought up earlier.
1458760	1460960	They're going to die out.
1460960	1465200	We already see now, even for some of these hardcore people,
1465520	1471400	a level of acceptance that they that their predecessors would not have had.
1471720	1474160	There's some younger younger
1475880	1479160	folks out there that are very loud and even crazier.
1479160	1482080	So like, I hope they all die out.
1482080	1486960	But some and somebody I just I kept not reading these chat comments.
1486960	1488160	Sorry, because we kept having other thoughts.
1488160	1491440	But Mike Defton chat earlier said the thing is, even if those people die,
1491440	1494240	their teaching still continues with their offspring. Right.
1494240	1497800	So it's education is is the big thing.
1497800	1500240	And there's a lot of people out there that need one.
1500240	1503520	And that's why I was saying the narrative needs to change
1503520	1506360	and be presented differently.
1506360	1508800	That if exposure
1509640	1514680	is already going to be a big factor in making change.
1515480	1518520	I know we're getting a little away from the topic
1518520	1520920	that it's kind of started this whole thing, however.
1520920	1523320	And I want to point this out, just like when we went on a rant
1523320	1524680	on our 20th anniversary episode
1524680	1526960	about what was happening to women's rights, this country and everything.
1526960	1529200	I want to I want to make this very clear.
1529200	1532280	Does this relate to gaming? 100 percent? Absolutely.
1532280	1535120	Yes, it does. Because remember, we don't just talk about video games,
1535280	1537560	gaming news and gaming culture. And this.
1538600	1540560	Mentality.
1541120	1546440	Has a cycle of infecting gaming culture regularly.
1547680	1551000	Mm hmm. And it needs to stop it all the time.
1551040	1553040	I dealt with it today on freaking Twitter.
1553320	1554560	It's just. Yeah.
1554560	1559520	So if you if you feel we dedicated too much time to this topic, too bad,
1559520	1563200	because we waste too much time reading this bullshit on social media
1563520	1565480	all of the time and it needs to stop.
1566960	1571040	On that note, let's talk about the types of games
1571040	1575160	that we've been playing this week, what games we're drowning our sorrows in.
1575320	1578280	No, I mean, honestly, yes, that that story pissed me off.
1578280	1580080	But otherwise, you know what?
1580080	1582200	I'm not going to let some bitch bring me down.
1582200	1583360	I had a good week.
1583360	1585240	I'm going to continue to have a great month.
1585240	1587800	I'm thriving. Those people are idiots.
1588600	1590520	I don't care. So moving on.
1590520	1591920	How was your gaming week?
1591920	1594480	How are you thriving in video games this week?
1594640	1596800	How are you making somebody mad?
1596800	1600720	Dark Sakura, by being a woman daring to play video games
1600720	1603240	on her own terms, this mostly woman.
1603240	1605440	Well, OK, yes.
1606960	1610560	I I played a bunch of Dead by Daylight.
1610560	1611480	I played with Finara.
1611520	1613560	I actually went back and played a little bit of Killer
1613560	1615960	and I ended up just making it like a fun farming match
1615960	1618120	because of all the stinky other killers that have been around.
1618920	1622360	So I did like that, you know, the doctor thing
1622360	1625200	where you have to shock four people and then you're good.
1625200	1626320	Like the daily.
1626320	1630120	I did that and then I went around and making them drop pallets on me
1630120	1633920	so I could bust those pallets and finish the pallet breaking challenge as well.
1634400	1638560	And, you know, it was just I tried to be like non stinky.
1638560	1640800	I don't care if I quote lose.
1641080	1642560	I don't play for my level.
1642560	1643600	I don't play for points.
1643600	1645680	I don't play to win a play to have fun.
1645680	1648400	And a lot of killers out there have been assholes
1648400	1652640	and just not letting people have fun or ending the game too quickly
1652960	1655400	or camping and tunneling people out.
1655400	1660480	And I'm I went in to play just to to have fun,
1660480	1665240	just to be silly, just to let other people have a break from the garbage,
1665680	1668320	you know, and then get blood points for it.
1669320	1673040	Um, and and I also played with
1673400	1676440	Franklish eight, who's another streamer who.
1678360	1681760	We had a lot of fun. It was just really random.
1681760	1684760	I kind of was like not in the mood to play Final Fantasy.
1684760	1687240	So we started Final Fantasy four and then we went and played.
1687520	1688720	That was really fun.
1688720	1691040	And I got to play with intoxicated.
1692240	1696160	And walking disaster, few streamers, really fun people.
1696720	1702120	Um, and then, um, last Sunday, I did buy Cult of the Lamb
1702120	1703440	and I've got it all set up.
1703440	1706640	I just need to install the extension for for Twitch.
1707320	1713000	And, um, I also played a little bit more hooked on you.
1713680	1716480	But for some reason, it didn't record that I had the hours on it.
1716480	1718640	So it must be like a glitch on Twitch or something.
1720760	1723120	Actually, it would be in my Windows partition.
1724120	1726240	Um, I did, I did.
1726280	1730880	Oh, I'm playing word scapes that I hit over level 100,000.
1731040	1732040	I think it is.
1732960	1737680	Hold on, maybe level 10,000, but I played a lot of it
1737880	1740440	and I enjoy that stupid little game.
1740440	1741280	It's a lot of fun.
1741840	1746800	Um, I am also, I think right now, a fourth place in tournament mode.
1747560	1752840	OK, I'm on one on ten thousand three hundred and forty nine that level.
1754120	1760720	Um, I am also playing Final Fantasy four.
1761520	1769600	Um, I, uh, Cecil has just become a paladin and we're going to rescue, uh, Rosa.
1771000	1774880	And I'm, I'm having a lot of fun with that too.
1775000	1779040	Um, I got, uh, Palom and Porom.
1779920	1780760	Oh, I love them.
1781400	1782080	The brat kids.
1782080	1783000	Yeah, I love them.
1783560	1785520	Uh, well, only one of them is really a brat.
1785520	1787760	The other one's a little too nice, but I love the thwap.
1787800	1789720	I forgot about the thwapping on the head.
1791080	1796040	Every time, uh, uh, Porom says something rude, Palom comes over and goes,
1796160	1798840	Thwap, and you hear the pop noise in the game.
1798840	1799840	I had forgotten about that.
1800520	1805880	Um, and, uh, now the thing is I'm playing a translation from the
1805880	1810400	Japanese version with no censorship, like the uncensored sprites and everything.
1810840	1814120	So I, I missed the spoonie Bard line.
1814480	1818560	The line that he said was like, you son of a bitch, you know, which is
1818560	1819800	probably a little bit more accurate.
1819800	1824280	And it talks like more about people dying and, and, you know, mass
1824280	1825960	attacks and burying their dead.
1825960	1828480	It's, it's definitely a lot more gritty.
1829040	1831760	Um, but it's still, I still love the game.
1832320	1838600	Um, and I'm considering final fantasy five next, either that or maybe star ocean.
1839120	1839480	Okay.
1840160	1840520	Yeah.
1841040	1842120	Um, but we'll see.
1842200	1843400	And yeah.
1843760	1844080	All right.
1844640	1846400	Uh, let's go over to Loki.
1846440	1847240	Talk about your gaming week.
1847240	1847600	Loki.
1848200	1850040	Um, still my craft.
1850080	1853960	Uh, we did do a live stream though yesterday, so that was cool.
1853960	1855520	I got to participate that.
1855560	1858960	So we did a stream day, uh, for the whole channel 64 server.
1859320	1863840	And we were streaming, I think like almost 14 hours.
1864120	1864840	Wow.
1865200	1866000	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
1866000	1868320	We had like about, I think eight people participate.
1868800	1869880	So that was pretty nice.
1869880	1871200	We each had like a two hour block.
1871680	1872320	It was fun.
1872640	1878200	You know, I launched pillagers in the space with a flying machine and I, uh, what
1878200	1878440	else?
1878440	1879400	Oh, just.
1880680	1882480	Messed around on the server a little bit.
1882760	1885600	Um, didn't really have too much, uh, planned out.
1885640	1889400	Although this week I may want to stream again.
1889880	1893240	Um, because St Rose coming out.
1893520	1895160	Yeah, big deal.
1895640	1902080	And also, uh, you know, arcade paradise, the game that's playing behind me, um, is
1902080	1903960	another game that I want to check out as well.
1903960	1905080	It looks pretty cool.
1905400	1909760	It's like a SIM game where you're running a laundromat that you're, I think trying to
1909760	1911120	convert over to an arcade.
1911160	1911480	Yeah.
1911840	1912920	Um, so it's pretty cool.
1913760	1914200	Nice.
1914680	1915040	All right.
1915440	1920160	Um, my game a week, a lot of the usual stuff still dead by daylight, Final Fantasy 14,
1920160	1921040	really excited.
1921040	1923720	Uh, we get a patch very soon for Final Fantasy 14.
1923720	1924720	So I'm excited for that.
1925240	1929360	Um, I actually played some other random stuff this week, the outside of my norm.
1929360	1934640	So, um, uh, Alan has been recently kind of into pinball games again on the PC he was
1934640	1935000	playing.
1935040	1936880	I just, I was watching over his shoulder.
1936880	1939760	He was playing the, um, which collection was it?
1939800	1942440	Not, not pinball FX, but the other one.
1942760	1948840	Um, of course the name, uh, no, cause that's where pinball FX started was in pinball.
1948840	1952240	It's the other companies like arcade treasures, pinball arcade.
1952360	1953000	Thank you, Bobby.
1953280	1954000	It's pinball arcade.
1954240	1957760	So pinball arcade had all the Williams licenses in it.
1957760	1962520	So I was watching him playing the Elvira tables that he bought a long time ago in that, um,
1962760	1963400	collection.
1963720	1967800	But you know, a few years ago, I think it was like 2018, the licenses moved.
1967880	1971320	So he's still playing in the old one because of course once you buy it, they can't take it away from you.
1971320	1972240	So you still play it there.
1972240	1976880	But now pinball FX has a lot of those like Bally midway table licenses.
1977320	1983800	So, um, it actually kind of made me go, Oh, I kind of want to check out, like, I forgot pinball FX, like was supposed to be having a new
1983800	1986200	version because I was like, whatever happened to that series?
1986200	1988800	They have pinball FX three, and then I haven't heard anything since then.
1988800	1995400	Well, they're rebooting basically into pinball FX and it is out in early release on the Epic game store.
1995680	2003480	Um, and I believe it's going to come out steam and the other platforms to, uh, uh, the consoles when it actually releases.
2003520	2004280	Don't quote me on that.
2004280	2008400	I can't remember if the steam part is, um, but it is a free to play.
2008480	2010400	Um, Oh, thank you, Bob.
2010400	2012560	Bobby says steam will be a year after Epic game store.
2012560	2014400	Well, I think it started in like June or something.
2014600	2016480	So I downloaded it to check it out.
2016480	2022040	And, uh, the, the kind of unfortunate part is that they don't have all of the tables moved over yet.
2022360	2030400	Um, and, and they're like, for example, those Elvira tables, uh, that Alan has, you can't get those in the new pinball FX.
2030400	2032480	I don't think they were ever in pinball FX three either.
2032640	2034440	So there are some licensed tables in there.
2034440	2041680	In fact, there's quite a few, I shouldn't even say some, um, but you can't get the vast amount of library that the other games had built up.
2041680	2047400	And they're having to redo it basically from where they were at and pinball FX three, because this is an all new engine.
2047400	2051720	I believe it's capable of four K and does Ray tracing and all this other stuff.
2051720	2056080	And yeah, Bobby's talking about how your purchases actually don't transfer over from FX three.
2056320	2061800	So they're kind of committing to supporting both, but it isn't, it is an odd reboot for the series.
2061800	2064200	But here, here's the, I know I can see why they're doing it.
2064200	2079320	They're doing it because another model now that they have in here is a subscription where you can subscribe and get all the tables or most of them for a low, low monthly price to, uh, so, uh, I'm sure that's one big reason they want to move that direction.
2079520	2086160	And, uh, everything is like you buy tickets and then use tickets to buy the tables and this type of thing, but they do have free tables.
2086160	2093640	So like one of my favorite pinball tables, the Arabian nights table happened to be the free one on Friday or Saturday.
2093720	2095600	So I was able to play it and check it out a little bit.
2095600	2096960	And I had played another one too.
2096960	2100480	There was a space, I think it was called space station or something as a pinball table.
2100680	2102280	There was a free game at some point as well.
2102280	2103440	So I was checking those out.
2103560	2106280	So it is nice that they rotate through a couple of free tables.
2106280	2107640	So you can really kind of check it out.
2107880	2116200	Um, it also, I guess part of what they've done with pinball FX is like, now you have a pinball room that you can, uh, you know, collect things and build out in.
2116440	2121080	Yeah, it's one of those, but I, I didn't understand how to use it.
2121080	2124640	And I don't know if that's just because I didn't really pay any money for anything yet.
2124680	2127120	Uh, it didn't really seem that intuitive to use.
2127320	2128840	I could like change the carpet.
2128840	2132960	And that was about, I don't know, it doesn't, I didn't really have a lot to do with it, but whatever.
2132960	2134840	It's really about the pinball at the end of the day.
2135120	2139960	Um, it looks nice, uh, very nice resolution, very crisp, but it's just kind of a bummer.
2139960	2142080	It's like they have to rebuild the whole thing.
2142080	2147920	Um, Bobby Blackwell says they did release the Indiana Jones table on FX three.
2147920	2148080	Yeah.
2148080	2151680	And it's $15 if you want that table on a pinball effects.
2152000	2156160	So I'm, but I imagine Harris's Ford Harrison Ford's likeness probably isn't cheap.
2156480	2157520	So it is what it is.
2158320	2161000	One of those for a little bit.
2161160	2164320	And then we, I think we sold it to get a different table.
2164440	2164720	Yeah.
2165280	2168280	So anyway, I mean, to, to get, download it for free.
2168320	2168760	Sure.
2168760	2169520	And check it out.
2169520	2169760	Sure.
2169760	2170640	It was, it was cute.
2170640	2171160	It was fun.
2171680	2175080	I don't know if I'll be buying any tables anytime real soon, but I'll keep an eye.
2175080	2176560	I'll keep an eye on what they're offering in there.
2176560	2182560	They had, is it bride of pin bot was what they, they didn't have regular pin bot, but they had bride of pin bot, which I thought was interesting.
2182560	2184360	So, all right.
2184440	2186280	Um, let's see other games I played this week.
2186280	2188200	So I randomly played Mario Kart eight.
2188240	2189760	I was, uh, out last night.
2189760	2191480	I ended up going out to San Francisco last night.
2191480	2199120	I was hanging out with listener and participant JD, uh, you know, goes way back with the show and the, the, the Monty days and all that stuff.
2199320	2200920	And we were playing Mario Kart eight last night.
2200920	2202720	So I finally got to see all these extra tracks.
2202720	2204040	I just hadn't gotten around to playing yet.
2204040	2209760	So we did some races on Waluigi pinball and the, the, um, Calamari desert.
2209760	2217960	Is that what it's called for the N64, the one with the train, uh, plot twist, the last lap forces you to go on the train tracks.
2217960	2223000	I remember that was the thing you could do on the N64, but now like, that's the, the last lap.
2223040	2226760	You have to drive down the train tracks, which is a very interesting, yeah.
2226760	2228160	They, they made some cool changes like that.
2228160	2229560	Sorry, spoiler alert.
2229560	2231000	But that track has been out for a few weeks.
2231000	2231640	I got to play those.
2231640	2233320	Like we have the DLC for it.
2233320	2234920	I don't think I've updated it though.
2235000	2236280	Yeah, you should check it out.
2236280	2236760	They're good.
2236800	2238280	Uh, so yeah, I had fun with that.
2238480	2249600	And then random, we went into the classic super Nintendo library and we were playing paddle DePone last night over the weird thing is, so you have to still do it through the internet.
2249600	2252120	We couldn't just connect to each other cause we were in the same room.
2252320	2257480	We had to do it through the internet, but we were able to play, um, paddle DePone, which is basically it's Tetris attack.
2257480	2259400	It's Pokemon puzzle league, but on the super Nintendo.
2259600	2260800	We were playing that against each other.
2260800	2262160	He, he would be in that though.
2262160	2263520	I, I have, I'm out of practice.
2263520	2264520	I haven't played in a long time.
2264520	2267960	So that was, uh, yeah, so, but that was fun.
2267960	2271400	So I got to play some stuff that is a little outside of my norm for gaming week.
2271400	2281320	So, uh, hoping to continue that trend as we move on throughout the week and, uh, get into, uh, closer and closer to dragon con is coming up real soon.
2281600	2285480	Um, I should talk a little bit here about dragon con and what's going on there.
2285560	2291240	So, uh, we will not be here in two weeks, um, because dragon con is happening that weekend.
2291240	2308000	And as the case has been for, I want to say the last 10 years now, I mean, I don't know if, I don't think we get to count the year that the pandemic happened and it was all virtual, but otherwise for like the past 10 years, cause 2012 was my first year I've been heading out to dragon con every labor day weekend.
2308360	2313440	So, uh, this year I'm going out again and the app was updated this week.
2313480	2315960	So I can tell you about my schedule.
2316080	2323440	So, uh, here's where I'm going to be appearing at dragon con Friday at one o'clock, uh, diversity in video games.
2323440	2324880	Why representation matters.
2324880	2327760	I'll be moderating that panel, uh, for the video game track.
2327800	2330760	Uh, I did a similar one last year and it was a great discussion.
2330760	2331640	So I'm excited about that.
2331920	2342640	Uh, two 30 on Friday, thriving on streaming media after 40, I couldn't fit the full name on my little flyer, but it's how do you do fellow kids thriving on streaming media after 40.
2342680	2345680	So that's, uh, that's the, that's the name of that panel.
2345840	2347840	I'm going to be on that with Bobby black Wolf.
2348200	2351520	Um, and, uh, but he's only 29.
2351520	2352600	That doesn't seem right.
2352640	2355320	I, I think he snuck his way onto it.
2355320	2356640	Like a lot of these kids do.
2356640	2360160	So, um, everyone's always trying to be an adult.
2360160	2363760	There's some other famous podcasts, like legit famous podcasting face.
2363760	2370080	So there, I don't follow a lot of this, this stuff, but the, the macro brothers are on this panel.
2370080	2372920	So am I have friends that listen to them and really enjoy them?
2373360	2381880	Um, so, uh, apparently it's, it's, it's a big deal and I know that I know they have a lot of fans, so that's, that's going to be a, certainly a sold out wall to wall type of thing.
2382200	2383280	Uh, so that'll be exciting.
2383800	2391600	Uh, let's see also, uh, uh, on the agenda, um, we have on a Saturday at two 30.
2391600	2392680	Oh, Bobby points out too.
2392680	2394680	He's the moderator of that panel.
2394680	2396720	So maybe he doesn't have to be 40 to moderate it.
2396720	2398000	I guess that's, that's the deal.
2398000	2402600	Maybe a Saturday at two 30, this is new for me.
2403000	2405880	Uh, I'll be making my first appearance on the horror track.
2405960	2410000	Uh, and that's something I've been kind of hinting at for a couple of weeks that I'm doing something new this year.
2410000	2411000	And I'm really excited.
2411280	2420320	Um, a lot of, you know, that, um, outside of doing, you know, video game commenting and broadcasting and all that stuff, um, I do stuff with a horror hosting and I've, I've done some stuff here locally.
2420320	2423160	We did a great lost boys tribute with some of the stars in the movie.
2423360	2426320	We did a twin peaks event in January with some of the stars.
2426480	2432680	So I've been getting to, to do more and more of that and kind of, you know, learning about what I do and I don't love in the genre.
2432680	2433920	And so, um, this is great.
2433920	2437880	And I'm really excited for this opportunity to be a panelist on this panel horror.
2437880	2439600	Why does it get no respect?
2439640	2441760	And, uh, we'll, we'll talk a little bit about that.
2441960	2444400	Uh, cause you know, I have some unique insight on that.
2444400	2450280	So, um, and uh, yeah, it was Tony Collette robbed of an Oscar for, um, hereditary.
2450480	2451640	Yes, of course she was.
2451640	2466080	But you know, that's because people don't hold a horror up in the same, uh, calibers, a lot of other movies often, but anyway, uh, also on Saturday surviving the evolution of podcasting to video over on the digital media track.
2466240	2470080	This is a topic that, you know, we've been talking about for a little while.
2470120	2472680	Um, so I'm excited to participate in this discussion again.
2472680	2474520	Obviously I have some things to say about it.
2475400	2484480	Sunday at one o'clock, I'm moderating a discussion with some, um, uh, folks in the industry on ask the experts microtransactions in gaming.
2484680	2487680	So it's one of those microtransactions are here to stay.
2487680	2490200	What's the good, the bad, and the ugly of all that stuff.
2490200	2491600	So we'll get into that.
2492040	2495960	And then Monday at 1130 AM, this one's a ballroom panel.
2495960	2496800	This is a pretty big deal.
2496800	2503200	The voice actors from Red Dead Redemption one and two, we have four voice actors from the games that are going to be there.
2503200	2504640	And we're doing a ballroom panel on Monday.
2504960	2506200	Here's the interesting thing though.
2506400	2511080	They're actually running this panel Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.
2511080	2517840	It's, it's basically the big stars for Dragon cons video game track this year, as far as I know, I don't know, but they're running that panel.
2518000	2524520	So I'm, I'm a little bit like, okay, by Monday, I think they're going to have been asked a lot of questions, so we'll, we'll see.
2524520	2527000	It's going to be an interesting, and Monday is like 1130.
2527400	2529840	That's the time everyone's checking out of the hotel.
2529920	2534120	So it's going to be interesting to see who shows up and what they have to ask.
2534120	2541320	I probably a lot of locals don't have to worry about the hotel checkout game, but I'm very excited for the opportunity and to meet the people.
2541920	2542840	That'll be a lot of fun.
2542920	2545480	So yeah, three tracks this year.
2545480	2546560	I'm really excited about it.
2546560	2550360	And I'll look forward to seeing some of you Dragon Con Labor Day weekend.
2550360	2552120	I've been getting a question online a lot.
2552120	2553520	Will the panels be streamed?
2553760	2560520	The only one that I know of that is streamed is that, um, how do you do fellow kids, uh, thriving over 40?
2560800	2567360	Uh, that panel will be on Dragon cons, uh, digital media, um, Twitch that's DC digital media.
2567480	2576520	If you want to follow that, the other panels, unfortunately, I don't know if they're straddle think they are, they may be recorded for future use, but I don't want to guarantee anything.
2576720	2581440	I, one of them may be on Dragon con TV subscription service, but I don't want to guarantee that either.
2581640	2592720	Um, so honestly, I think Dragon con would just prefer if you really want to see the panels that bad come out, but, uh, to be fair, there's a lot of hesitations still around COVID understandably.
2592720	2595360	So they have tried to up their virtual offerings.
2595360	2598880	I will say a lot more is online than you would have found a couple of years ago.
2598880	2599640	So there is that.
2600280	2600680	Okay.
2601600	2605000	Uh, SG100 Matt says, I'm excited for both Rob and Bobby.
2605000	2606280	You're on some fun panels.
2606280	2606680	Yeah.
2606720	2608040	Um, uh, we're excited.
2608080	2611120	We've be very, uh, very, very fun.
2611600	2616280	Um, all right, let's get into some more gaming news for the week.
2616280	2619720	I'm going to kick it over to Loki to start us off with some other gaming news.
2620880	2633840	Uh, yeah, so, um, unfortunately we have more news to kind of tie into the story we talked about last week about allegations of sexual harassment at Nintendo of America.
2634240	2638480	And this is coming now from, um, the testing side of that.
2638480	2652280	So the game testers who are, you know, a lot of times contracted for Nintendo and stuff, um, have recounted lots of different scenarios where they've been sexually harassed.
2652280	2658240	So they talked about, there was an article on Kotaku that kind of went into detail about it.
2658240	2668000	Um, talking about like one of the testers who they're calling Hannah, who had, um, experiences that led her to quit her job.
2668040	2687400	Um, basically saying it was supposed to be a lighthearted place, but then ended up that, um, there was a male translator that they were working with that started posting, um, you know, uh, memes and stuff about why, like, what's the best Pokemon to have sex with.
2687440	2692560	And started making kind of like an, I mean, that's not, that's not necessarily work discussion.
2692640	2693960	I would think most of the time.
2694000	2699320	Uh, yeah, it's, uh, probably, yeah, just because it involves Pokemon does not make it appropriate for work.
2700040	2700320	Yeah.
2700320	2702120	And it started escalating from there.
2702160	2706240	Um, you know, she said that it's, Nintendo was almost like a nightmare.
2706240	2707960	It is sad because I love Nintendo.
2708160	2709640	I grew up in Nintendo.
2709680	2715400	I was so excited to join Nintendo when I first got there and thought it was, I was going to go somewhere.
2715640	2718920	Um, I had my supervisors tell me I was doing such a great job.
2719680	2729640	Um, but then of course, you know, there's been other, um, recounts of different things, you know, the common saying that they've really felt like a frat house sometimes.
2729840	2738720	So kind of the whole just misogyny and just uncomfortable, you know, sexual comments and, you know,
2739680	2743080	type tiger claw and chat says water cooler type of discussions.
2743200	2744600	No, no, no.
2744640	2745720	Inappropriate ones.
2745760	2750880	A water cooler discussion would be, Hey, did you see who got kicked off the mass singer last night?
2751080	2755480	That is an appropriate work, uh, discussion water cooler discussion.
2755760	2756640	Uh, yeah.
2756680	2758960	Would you rather fuck Pikachu or Jigglypuff?
2758960	2762640	That's not an appropriate water cooler discussion, whether it was at the water cooler or not.
2763160	2763360	Yeah.
2763360	2774400	Then outside of the sexual comments, there was also, you know, the, your typical, um, you know, discrimination based on gender for like promotions and whatnot.
2774400	2780280	So for example, one of the female contractors, uh, was trying to advance to the company.
2780680	2786400	I applied for a bunch of other jobs in the industry and they would ask me why I was looking to leave Nintendo.
2786480	2789280	I, I'm sorry, I know you're saying it the way it is.
2789280	2791320	I know you are, but it's just one of those things.
2791400	2796120	It was like, how disgusting is it that we have, this is just the typical discrimination you see in the industry.
2796120	2804120	This is just the, here's our, you know, our, our, uh, uh, assembly line discrimination we have going on, uh, behind the scenes at the different companies.
2804120	2808360	Like I just, I, I hate that we're here, but we're here.
2808360	2808920	We've been here.
2808920	2809680	We've been here.
2810440	2811800	It sounds so familiar.
2811800	2816680	It's like we talked about this dozens of times, just insert every company in here.
2817640	2825480	There was one, uh, another tester, uh, Valerie Allison that, uh, said she would ask her managers how she would be promoted to a permanent position.
2826160	2837720	And, um, basically that she felt pressure to become a full-time play because she needed to stay at Lincoln and says, uh, your chance to be converted to full-time was probably worse as a girl.
2837720	2844600	She said, um, it's usually the guys who get promoted and they're all usually friends.
2844600	2846040	They all watch super bowl together.
2846200	2849320	As she went on to Matt and chat says, these are not isolated issues.
2849320	2851960	This is an epidemic within the industry, a hundred percent.
2851960	2856200	I wouldn't even say it's necessarily just this industry, even it's just true.
2856200	2857880	This is just corporate.
2857880	2859720	Um, but this is it.
2859720	2861400	You notice what's happened here.
2861400	2863400	We had one Nintendo story.
2863400	2872040	Then we had a second Nintendo story and now the dam is starting to burst because now what you've just named three different women, at least so far in this.
2872040	2875320	So now people are starting to realize, oh, it wasn't just me.
2875320	2877000	This was an epidemic.
2877000	2879720	I mean, it keeps saying that they're taking, going to take this seriously.
2879720	2880120	All right.
2880120	2880520	We'll see.
2881560	2882600	Let's see what you do.
2882600	2887880	Now, Nintendo has to acknowledge it because they have very clearly been trying to hide from it when it was one or two.
2887880	2892920	And this is, this is now the first time where I believe Doug Bowser finally had to comment on it this week.
2892920	2900520	Like somebody finally called him out on it, um, and asked him like, what the hell's the plan to, you know, stop this culture?
2901080	2904760	Um, which I felt was a very non-answer answer.
2905560	2912120	Um, let's, let's see, you know, but here's the thing at the end of the day, I'm not interested in his words.
2912680	2915000	I'm not, I'm interested in the actions.
2915720	2919880	So if Doug Bowser really wants to say something, say it with action.
2920920	2922760	I could care less what his comment was on this.
2923960	2924460	Yeah.
2927000	2927880	Anyway, yeah.
2928840	2936680	Basically, it's a, it's a very long article with lots of different examples of this, but like, honestly, like all of these examples, I could read every single one.
2937240	2946840	It's all stuff we've heard before, you know, where it's like, you know, if, if a female come, like tries to stand up for herself, they're just gonna be called overly sensitive.
2946840	2955960	If, you know, they try to advance in the company, they'll find excuses for why they can't without saying gender, you know, because obviously that's discriminatory.
2955960	2957560	But they'll, they'll make excuses.
2957560	2961640	Or I'm sure that compensation is probably more for the males than the females.
2961640	2964600	It's, we've heard this so many times.
2967000	2971480	And I wouldn't be surprised if it's not in every single company, at least large companies for sure.
2971480	2974120	I mean, some of these smaller, like indie studios and stuff.
2974760	2978440	I'm sure there's probably some, but like some of these, they're very small.
2978440	2990280	I can't imagine that there's, you know, they're really small teams, but like definitely in these larger companies, it's easier to lose sight on kind of the details when you're working with hundreds of employees.
2990920	2999720	And it's easy to have these folks in management just kind of off the rails without realizing it.
3001320	3008040	All right, I'm going to move on and talk about a part of the industry that is growing and growing and growing.
3008120	3013960	And that is the Embracer Group, who is starting to acquire quite a few holdings under their belt.
3014520	3019880	You may recall they bought that part of Square Enix that Square Enix was desperate to get rid of.
3019880	3024040	Like, oh, Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider is so bad.
3024040	3025800	We have to get rid of it right now.
3025800	3030360	Like, which I obviously I'm saying that very tongue in cheek because the Tomb Raider only wears one belt.
3030360	3031480	This is ridiculous.
3033240	3034920	Doesn't fit with our portfolio.
3035720	3039320	Anyway, so Embracer is on a spree right now.
3039320	3041560	One of the biggest things has been turning heads.
3041560	3051480	They now own JRR, the rights basically to, well, they actually they bought Middle Earth Enterprises.
3051480	3056360	That's the company that owns big screen and small screen rights to Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.
3057160	3061400	So this could this mean that a Hobbit game is on the horizon?
3061400	3063400	Probably going to be a long way out.
3063400	3067880	But, you know, but that's also the fact that they have the screen rights as well.
3067880	3071560	You know, this is what was used to make this 1978 animated film.
3071560	3074440	Peter Jackson's movies, Amazon's upcoming thing.
3074440	3081560	Oh, actually, Amazon's thing was a loophole because it excluded TV series of more than
3081560	3083560	eight or eight episodes or something like that.
3083560	3086440	There was some weird exclusion that they're kind of dancing around the rights with that.
3086440	3091400	But anyway, so that's not all of it, though.
3091400	3094680	Embracer also went and they bought more stuff as well.
3095560	3098360	They also got limited run games.
3098360	3103640	That's huge because they're doing a lot of those physical copy things of games and so forth.
3103640	3105480	That was brought up this week as well.
3106040	3112200	Tripwire Interactive, who made the games Killing 4 and Chivalry was that as well.
3112200	3116200	Tuxedo Labs, who made Tear Down was a part of that as well.
3116200	3121160	So, Embracer has been going through and buying all of these companies.
3122120	3127560	Another one that they got as part of this, Tatsujin, the Japanese studio.
3128600	3133480	The boss of Tatsujin is a co-founder of Tappelan, Mashihiro Yuge.
3133480	3135640	That's the developers of Zero Wing.
3136680	3144600	So, Toaplan has done a great many of awesome game, including, I want to say they did
3146200	3147400	Truxton, didn't they?
3149400	3150280	Yeah, Truxton.
3150280	3154440	Because here's an interesting kind of the same week this story comes out.
3155320	3157080	Fire and Fire Shark.
3157800	3161720	Classic games from this publisher are coming out to the PC.
3161720	3168600	Truxton, Twin Cobra, Out Zone, and Zero Wing, published and enhanced by Bitwave Games.
3169240	3172760	I'm not sure these games were in high demand, but cool.
3172760	3175720	People can now revisit one of the internet's first memes.
3175720	3179880	Because, of course, I think most people know at this point that All Your Base Belong to
3179880	3183400	Us, Move Every Zig, that's all from Zero Wing.
3183400	3186040	And I imagine they're going to leave all that translation intact.
3186840	3189480	But they are saying it's pixel perfect graphics.
3189480	3191240	There's going to be a very easy mode.
3191240	3193320	So, they're actually patching in a Bobby Black Wolf mode.
3193320	3194840	That's very exciting.
3194840	3199720	But yeah, all these games are coming to PC in 2022.
3200680	3201180	Fun.
3202060	3207580	Bobby Black Wolf giving us some insight to the Tripwire acquisition and tying this together
3207580	3208940	to something else you all might have heard about.
3209660	3214620	This is interesting because they made a statement that says the co-founder that had previously
3214620	3220940	made the anti-abortion comments will be exploring opportunities outside of Tripwire.
3220940	3225340	This was the only way Tripwire could remove that founder was by being bought.
3225340	3228940	He stepped down as CEO, but still owned most of the company.
3228940	3231820	You may recall that story from a little while ago.
3231820	3236140	That was the same company where the CEO was making, you know, the anti-abortion statements
3236140	3239340	that the folks that worked there didn't agree with.
3239340	3243500	And, you know, so now how this has come full circle.
3243500	3247340	They finally got rid of them or are going to get rid of them through this purchase.
3247900	3248540	Interesting.
3249260	3252300	So, let's see.
3252860	3256620	DarkTucionChat says, I found the developer on one of the other discords I hang out in.
3256620	3258780	Actually, these are the arcade ports.
3258780	3260540	Oh, I didn't realize that.
3260540	3265020	So that all your bases will not be present because that was in the console port.
3265020	3266140	So these are arcade ports.
3266140	3266860	Oh, that's too bad.
3267500	3271820	You'd think you'd think they're going to have a mode where you can change the dialogue.
3271820	3272940	That would be very upsetting.
3272940	3276620	I'm sure that a game that exists on PC can be modded.
3276620	3280860	Yeah, if this week has taught us anything dialogue, quote unquote.
3280860	3281660	Yeah, that's true.
3281660	3285340	If this week has taught us anything, there will be a dialogue fix patch for this game.
3285340	3285900	Absolutely.
3286780	3289980	As shown on a Mat and Chat wonders, I'm kind of interested what they will do with limited
3289980	3290860	run games.
3290860	3292780	Seems like they're keeping everyone there intact.
3292780	3294940	I wonder if there will be a straight cash infusion.
3295740	3298060	Possibly this could be a good thing for them.
3298060	3301340	I've heard that limited run games can be kind of slow sometimes.
3301340	3305580	So maybe a little injection of cash to help them deliver on things a little faster could
3305580	3308060	be cool if we're assuming that they're not completely evil.
3308940	3311420	That's the big assumption with the corporation.
3311420	3311660	True.
3312540	3318940	Remember that they have a giant game archive now that they purchased as well.
3318940	3320620	Oh, yeah, that's true.
3320620	3321020	Yeah.
3321020	3325020	So perhaps some of that could play into this as well.
3325020	3325820	Interesting.
3325820	3326320	All right.
3327580	3334700	Well, we'll see what continues as Embracer is becoming quite the Voltron in the industry.
3334700	3340620	As I've heard Bobby refer to him on his show, the 10 cent of Europe is building strongly
3340620	3341020	over there.
3341900	3342460	All right.
3342460	3344620	In the meantime, let's move on to another story.
3344620	3345260	Dark Sakura.
3346860	3351660	So developers are not beyond being assholes.
3352460	3356780	In fact, we know a good many in the industry are assholes as we've just covered.
3358060	3362620	But it's not just the big names.
3362620	3365420	We have some from some of the indie developers as well.
3366860	3369820	So Dolphin Barn Incorporated.
3370220	3374140	They've already gotten into Hot Water.
3376540	3381740	They were talking, you know, they already put in some anti-mask rhetoric in one of their
3381740	3383660	patch notes for one of their games.
3385420	3395580	And basically, they have been sending abusive messages when they've banned players from
3395580	3396140	their hub.
3397020	3406060	And they were warned once saying that when posting any content in the community or communicating
3406060	3409340	with players, please make sure it adheres to the guidelines.
3411580	3420460	But now they've been responding to negative reviews on Steam in a very abusive manner.
3421260	3426140	And so they also added, Steam did, we also want to make it clear that you should not
3426140	3430380	reverse the moderator decisions or enable rule violations on your hub.
3430380	3435340	Future disregard for our rules and guidelines could jeopardize our business relationship.
3436060	3441180	So they are banned from their own game community.
3443500	3448380	And this isn't the only time you like I said, they had the anti-mask rhetoric.
3448460	3455420	They also, May last year, they added a note about combat in a game that says, weak men
3455420	3456620	lack character.
3461500	3464380	It's really disgusting.
3464380	3467500	So yeah, they're banned from their own game.
3467500	3470700	You kind of have to love the punchline there, though.
3470700	3476140	Like you're so you're such an asshole, you got banned from a store that sells your game.
3476220	3478620	You got banned from a store that sells your game.
3478620	3480700	It's wild.
3481500	3487100	Yeah, they honestly, they shouldn't, I think, be allowed to post to Steam anymore.
3488300	3492140	Yeah, because I mean, honestly, they're still making money off this game.
3492140	3493260	So whatever.
3495260	3498140	I don't usually support piracy, but all right.
3499740	3503100	Anyway, don't even don't even support their game through piracy.
3503100	3504380	Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
3505260	3507100	Just their game shouldn't be touched.
3508060	3509900	Even acknowledging it here is dirty.
3509900	3513100	But you still have to like, this doesn't happen every day.
3513100	3513980	We're developers.
3513980	3517660	So yeah, you just have it every day where a developer is so toxic, they get banned from
3517660	3518460	their own forum.
3518460	3519900	It does make for a great headline.
3520860	3521420	All right.
3521420	3525180	Fifth Dream in chat says, why are these men so interested in whether other men live up
3525180	3526860	to their man standards?
3526860	3530780	Great question, because these are the same men, as I was saying earlier, that are like,
3530780	3532940	you could be gay, just don't hit on me.
3535020	3542380	Math, puzzle figures floating around the screen right now, because I don't understand.
3544300	3547420	They should just have their fingers and tongues cut out or something.
3550220	3555180	Metaphorically, of course, because we would never advocate violence here on Twitch television.
3555180	3556220	I wouldn't ever.
3557580	3562380	Moving on, let's talk about something else that should be banned from Steam.
3562380	3563740	I think it actually already is.
3563740	3565980	But Loki, please give us some insight.
3565980	3567740	Hey, I don't think it's ever going to be on.
3568300	3569260	I don't even know if.
3569260	3570860	Oh, I guess it did make it on Steam.
3570860	3573500	But yeah, I thought these games are banned from Steam.
3573500	3574620	But what do I know?
3575420	3581740	Yeah, so anyways, a game called Untamed Isles, who was kind of like a Pokemon game.
3581740	3584380	But then but then, you know, what makes Pokemon better?
3584380	3587100	Let's throw some crypto stuff in there as well.
3587100	3588780	NFTs, you know, love that.
3589740	3593100	So it raised half a million dollars on Kickstarter.
3593660	3596940	And that was a year ago.
3596940	3600700	And now it can't even make its money back.
3600700	3604300	They had posted an update on the game's Steam page
3604300	3608380	saying that we had to pause development of Untamed Isles and put the project on hold.
3610540	3614700	There have been a myriad of factors that have caused the lead up to this very moment.
3614700	3617740	But what all comes down to is we're finally unable to
3617740	3621260	financially keep up with the demands that we set out to do.
3622780	3626060	Basically, the crypto market is crashed.
3626060	3631900	And so they we leaned into the crypto market and expanded rapidly off the back of the positive
3631900	3632380	interest.
3632380	3637100	And when the crash came, we ended up heavily exposed with too short of a runway.
3637100	3641340	So basically, they took all your money that that you invested in the game.
3641340	3644780	They put it in the crypto market thinking, hey, double or nothing, right?
3646540	3647420	Well, nothing.
3648140	3651740	They still need to be responsible for for paying back the money.
3652380	3655340	Well, these are due to our cash reserves being empty.
3655340	3657900	We're not in a position to refund our initial backers.
3659180	3664620	We're sorry, but hey, I mean, technically, Kickstarter is just supporting the company
3664620	3666060	and not getting a product.
3666060	3671020	So, you know, by unfortunately, this happens often on Kickstarter, which is why I stopped
3671340	3674300	contributing kickstarters and why we don't have guests on the show anymore promoting
3674300	3675100	kickstarters.
3675100	3680380	It's just sorry, but it's there's just too many of these types of stories, not the crypto
3680380	3683660	thing necessarily, but just kickstarters that aren't able to follow through on their promises
3683660	3686780	where it's just like, I'm not interested in promoting that.
3686780	3691100	So yeah, unfortunately, a few bad apples have ruined it for everyone.
3691100	3692540	That's the reality.
3692540	3696700	So yeah.
3696700	3704060	Well, I can't I can't believe this concept just didn't catch on like wild.
3704060	3706620	So all right, let me move on.
3706620	3709100	I want to talk about this.
3709100	3710700	We kind of knew this was coming.
3710700	3714380	I think we even kind of addressed it on a previous episode, but I will just quickly
3714380	3716940	say confirmed the arcade went up.
3716940	3721180	NFL Blitz is coming back or seriously is coming out.
3721180	3724860	So NFL Blitz is coming back because an arcade went up is coming out.
3725580	3729180	So there are some issues that are going to be addressed in the game, though.
3729180	3733980	So it's interesting to kind of hear about some of the things that the NFL and all the
3733980	3739500	rights holders and various things, one of them to do to fix up the game, such as violent
3739500	3745420	collisions that were gratuitous things after the play and that went unpenalized.
3745420	3749420	So this is just the type of thing that has kind of aged bad in twenty five years.
3749420	3751740	So they've had to kind of scale that back a little bit.
3751740	3754460	You know, they wanted to still keep the spirit of the game, obviously.
3754460	3759420	But it's kind of like I get it sounds like the timer to do those types of things has
3759420	3761180	been pulled back significantly.
3761180	3762300	So it's kind of interesting.
3762860	3766540	And it sounds like they have a lot of the agreements to bring back old players in the
3766540	3767820	game, but you might not see them all.
3768940	3775740	But you will get 1997 NFL Blitz, NFL Blitz 99 and NFL Blitz 2000 Gold Edition.
3776460	3780700	And they actually had to go in and change some of the code to make it happen.
3781260	3783020	So I think it'll be cool.
3785260	3792140	I'm not like a super fan of this NFL Blitz series, but I know it's in the whole same
3792140	3797740	thing as like NBA Jam and, you know, kind of comes from that same era.
3797740	3798460	So, yeah.
3799980	3804860	S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, yeah, CTE isn't a joke and destroying players doesn't age
3804860	3805180	well.
3805180	3805740	Yeah.
3805740	3810460	So in dark to see, it says a lot of people were passing on this because of the changes.
3810780	3812140	Of course they are.
3812140	3814140	Then more for the rest of us.
3817340	3820620	Zen Monkey says, what's the point of bringing it back if they just have to make it like
3820620	3821740	every other football game?
3821740	3822060	Boo.
3822060	3824780	Make the teams robots and do your own thing, Blitz.
3824780	3826300	You don't need the NFL.
3826300	3831740	Well, that is that is a I was going to say, you know, but the idea of making them robots
3831740	3832780	or androids.
3832780	3833580	Interesting.
3834860	3838380	But I guess they wanted to err on the side of people would want to have at least some
3838380	3841580	of the players and so forth and still in the game.
3841580	3845340	And in order to make that happen, they wanted to do some of these changes.
3845340	3845840	So.
3847660	3851900	No, Bobby Blackwell points out Mutant Football League does exist exactly for that purpose
3851900	3852380	pretty much.
3852380	3853420	That's a good point.
3853420	3853920	So.
3854620	3857100	All right, let's move on to some more stories.
3857100	3857740	Stark Sakura.
3858940	3863820	So I know that a lot of people out there are big fans of Gran Turismo.
3864460	3867660	I know my hubby is a big fan of Gran Turismo.
3868780	3878220	And there is a car in Gran Turismo Sport that was designed by McLaren.
3879420	3885820	If you don't know what me and McLaren is, they've made some of like the best supercars,
3885820	3887580	you know, known to date.
3887580	3889580	I've got to drive a McLaren once.
3889580	3890140	It was great.
3890140	3901100	There was a car that they put in that was a virtual concept that was called the McLaren
3901100	3902300	Solus GT.
3903020	3907180	Well, McLaren now has manufactured the car.
3907180	3907980	It is.
3907980	3909100	It's a real thing now.
3910300	3915820	It is a 5.2 liter V10 engine, seven speed sequential shift.
3916460	3920300	It is pretty sleek.
3920300	3925980	It kind of has that sort of almost detached front two wheels look.
3927740	3930940	It's a fairly light car.
3934220	3939260	It's all full carbon fiber body and titanium.
3939900	3944860	And this thing would feel no pain around the track.
3946460	3951020	It honestly, it's just so freaking pretty.
3951020	3953580	It looks like the supercar.
3955420	3956060	I won't lie.
3957580	3962460	Anyone have a, you know, a couple of mails?
3962460	3966540	A house in San Francisco to sell to help you afford that.
3966540	3972780	No, it has a top speed of 322 kilometers an hour or 200 miles an hour.
3973660	3987340	And it has 650 Nm of torque and 1200 downforce at 150 miles an hour.
3988940	3991820	It's pretty intense.
3991820	3996620	This would be the thing that I would have watched on Top Gear.
3996620	3997100	I'll be perfectly honest.
3997100	3999420	The question is which paint job do you like the best?
4000220	4000460	Oh.
4001340	4004300	I think the orange and blue looks great.
4004300	4007420	The white and green makes me think of Jazz from Transformers.
4008860	4010380	Also a little black and orange is good.
4011420	4012620	Squiggly is not following.
4012620	4013820	I'm not feeling the squigglies.
4015820	4022780	I really like the black with the, yeah.
4022780	4023740	Is it orange or red?
4023740	4025020	It looked like it was red to me.
4026700	4028300	But it's also got a rainbow on it.
4028300	4028940	That's awesome.
4029820	4035020	But there's also this one that's like, uh, all black with gold detail on the tires.
4036380	4038540	And I think that that's pretty sharp.
4038540	4042860	That would be, that would be my jam without the numbers on it.
4043980	4048540	Cause I mean, the numbers are more for racing anyway, but not that, that would just be
4049500	4052140	pretty wicked, pretty wicked.
4053340	4056540	I hit the button to feel the drive.
4056540	4056780	Yeah.
4057580	4058860	Number two is I think.
4058860	4061340	I like the orange and blue with the little rainbow in the back.
4061340	4063180	That's, that's a hot car.
4063180	4064780	I really like that one for sure.
4065820	4067660	But yeah, I'll never be able to afford it.
4067660	4069820	So it's just something I can appreciate from a distance.
4071020	4076460	I think that the whole thing is just a beautiful piece of machinery.
4077420	4080620	I'm trying to figure out where the engine on it is.
4080620	4082780	Is it a, is it, I think it's a rear engine.
4083580	4084140	Oh, I'm sure.
4084620	4090620	Um, there was one that had a central engine and I don't remember whether it wasn't a McLaren,
4090620	4092780	but that thing was pretty interesting.
4092780	4094140	I'll quickly say something else to show.
4094140	4097580	And under Matt said in chat here saying coincidentally, the car costs as much in real
4097580	4102780	life as it costs in in-game currency and GT and a lifetime of saving and playing to afford.
4102780	4103020	Yes.
4104060	4104300	Yeah.
4105180	4109900	Um, I'm trying though to see, um,
4110540	4113420	I'm trying to, I guess it's a rear engine.
4113420	4117820	Um, uh, let's see, barrel throttle.
4117820	4127980	Oh, at any rate, at any rate, um, uh, it also apparently has like, uh, uh, oh, uh, the engine
4127980	4130620	is fixed, uh, to the chassis.
4131180	4131820	There we go.
4131820	4133020	Very interesting.
4133020	4133500	Yeah.
4133500	4138460	Um, this would definitely be on my list of dream cars, although I don't know if it's
4138460	4143020	on my list of dream cars, although I would still give somebody else's right arm for one
4143020	4144220	of the Bugatti Veyron's.
4146220	4147660	I love the way you phrase that.
4147660	4149660	I'd give somebody else's right arm, not mine.
4149660	4150300	Cause somebody else's.
4150300	4151740	In a heartbeat.
4152300	4154380	Here have, have this person's right arm.
4154380	4155980	Here's a doll's right arm.
4155980	4156700	All right.
4156700	4158220	Uh, let's move on.
4158220	4159980	We're going to get to our next story.
4159980	4164620	Uh, Loki, this is fascinating to me because we're talking about a fandom for a game that's
4164620	4165420	not real.
4165420	4166780	Help, help explain this here, please.
4166780	4167580	It's like a meme.
4167820	4174060	So it kind of reminds me a little bit of the free folk, um, which is the kind of the fan
4174060	4179660	community for a game of Thrones who turned on game of Thrones when season eight sucked.
4180380	4187820	Um, so it's kinda like that, but in a sense, uh, so what this is, it's about this game
4187820	4192380	called Arkham world, uh, which is not a real game, obviously.
4192380	4197260	Cause the next, uh, game that they're doing is, I don't remember what it's called now,
4197260	4201260	but it's like with Robin and stuff and, um, it doesn't matter.
4201260	4202940	Uh, Oh, I'm sorry.
4202940	4204140	They're doing suicide squad.
4204140	4205420	Oh, there was also Gotham nights.
4205420	4207020	That was the one of the nights.
4207020	4207820	It's this pod culture.
4208380	4208620	Yeah.
4208620	4209420	Gotham nights.
4209420	4214300	So Gotham nights, eh, it's kinda like, you know, not, not all that exciting.
4214300	4219100	So instead what the community is doing is they're talking about this like fictional
4219100	4221740	game as if it's real and it's already out.
4221740	4225660	Which is funny because like they keep posting all these like kind of memes or fake things
4225660	4229580	like talking about, like, you know, for those who haven't been, you know, keeping up with
4229580	4235260	like one year ago today, Batman Arkham world was released, you know, um, you know, what's,
4235260	4236540	what's your opinion about this game?
4236540	4239980	Or like they talked about, like, they keep like referencing stuff that happened in this
4239980	4240460	game.
4240460	4242060	Um, that's not real.
4242060	4246060	Like they'll have screenshots where, Hey, look, my favorite part of this game is Spider-Man
4246060	4247260	swinging in stuff like that.
4247980	4253900	It's kind of funny, like, um, a way to just talk about, you know, what they actually want
4253900	4258380	in the game, like a open world Arkham game versus what they're getting.
4259260	4262060	So has anyone streamed the game on Twitch yet?
4262060	4262860	That's what I want to see.
4264380	4265820	No, I don't think it's streaming.
4265820	4268060	Then somebody needs to take it to the next level.
4268060	4272860	Like we just had that story, excuse me, two weeks ago of the people that made that entirely
4272860	4277260	fake near level, like into the church and everything you need to, you Arkham world fans
4277260	4278700	need to get on that level.
4278700	4282220	You need to, if you really want to gaslight everyone into thinking your game is real,
4282220	4283420	you need to get on that level.
4284620	4289020	Well, the thing too about it is like, it's kind of funny, like, I mean, it's sort of
4289020	4296060	like civil disobedience as well, because you're like, instead of talking about, I mean, obviously
4296060	4302780	if the subreddit's not owned by the folks developing these Arkham games, um, but typically
4302780	4307100	like a studio would probably want to promote their game within that community.
4307100	4311900	And so kind of like, well, we, we don't really, we're not interested in your stupid Gotham
4311900	4312140	night.
4312140	4317260	So we're going to just talk about this other game and just talk about all this hypothetical
4317260	4318220	stuff that's going on.
4318220	4319260	It's kind of funny.
4319260	4320380	It's not an original idea.
4320380	4324220	Apparently, uh, one of the, the, uh, folks is sorry.
4324220	4329420	Unhappy worker 77 said that it was something that happened in the Titanfall community with,
4329420	4332620	uh, Titanfall three, where they pretend that's a real thing as well.
4332620	4333020	Yeah.
4333020	4333340	Yeah.
4334140	4335420	Which I wish it was a real thing.
4335420	4337180	Cause Titanfall two I hear is really good.
4337180	4338860	Apex is still pretty good though.
4338860	4345900	As far as those giant robot and giant giant mech robot is what makes everything better.
4345900	4346540	Everything better.
4347580	4347980	All right.
4348700	4351420	Well, retro goodness always makes things better too.
4351420	4356940	And of course, a lot of people are very excited about the mini Genesis two, uh, the full list
4356940	4358300	of games came out.
4358300	4364140	So we know exactly what is going to be, uh, in the Japanese version and the U S version
4364140	4367820	of the Sega, uh, Genesis or mega drive mini two.
4367820	4371580	The only way you can get one of these in North America, by the way, is to get one from Amazon,
4371580	4377740	Japan, which I think is interesting, but because there are so few of them being made because
4377740	4381020	of, you know, components and parts and things like that, they basically only have the one
4381020	4381660	way to get it.
4382300	4387820	Now, this whole thing, and this announcement of the big game list kicked off quite the
4387820	4389580	discussion in our discord this week.
4389580	4393580	I was almost a little taken by surprise how like much people had to say about it, uh,
4393660	4398620	in a pleasant way, uh, over on our discord, over at vog network.com slash discord.
4398620	4404940	And I'm going to make a long story, very short, basically with the lists for both these, um,
4404940	4410380	you know, the, the Japanese and the U S one coming out, it was noted, um, that there are
4410380	4414940	some games missing from the U S one that are going to be in the Japanese ones, namely the
4414940	4416700	lunar games is what it comes down to.
4416700	4419820	So the lunar games that are going to be in the Japanese one will not be in the U S one.
4420620	4423660	And, you know, that's ridiculous.
4423660	4425980	And people are pointing the fingers all over the place.
4426620	4433580	Um, there is a tweet that we were referenced here from mega drive shock, who kind of tries
4433580	4434780	to summarize what's going on here.
4434780	4439900	Victor Ireland sold the N a publishing and script rights to lunar back to game arts.
4439900	4443100	The only thing Ireland still owns is the audio.
4443100	4447740	The reason lunar won't be on the Genesis mini too is because Ireland wanted more money to
4447740	4453660	license the audio and, uh, it sources this Twitter account sources, an operation rainfall
4453660	4458460	interview where, um, in the interview of operation rainfall, he was asked, is there any chance
4458460	4461260	of this occurring again with Gaijin works?
4461260	4463820	Um, which I think was something else that was happening at the time.
4463820	4466460	And, uh, Victor said, I'm not going to say no.
4467420	4471820	I think it would be cool to do, but the thing is that with the way the rights are with lunar,
4471820	4473740	we sold most of the rights back to game arts.
4473740	4477100	So game arts has almost all the rights to lunar, except for the performance rights to
4477100	4477900	the audio.
4477900	4482060	So really they have most, uh, and if the lunar license was to happen, we would just be licensing
4482060	4482620	that little piece.
4482620	4485260	So it could come out and it would probably come out under their name.
4485260	4486460	So they would do marketing for it.
4486460	4491100	So I think it's unlikely, but I'm not going to say no, it would be cool to do here's here's
4491100	4493100	my take, which I don't think I've seen yet.
4493100	4494620	And I just kind of want to plant this.
4494620	4495180	Why?
4495180	4496140	Question mark seed.
4496780	4500460	If the audio is what's holding it back, why don't they replace it?
4501740	4503580	What do you mean saying you can't replace it?
4503580	4506460	We just talked about it with Sonic, the hedgehog three.
4506460	4508220	Do you know how much more money they would have to pay?
4508860	4511100	I know they just, they just did it with Sonic, the hedgehog.
4513340	4515180	And that was, that was Michael Jackson music.
4516060	4518300	Now, granted, that's a little different.
4518300	4518540	Yeah.
4518540	4523660	But I'm just like, I, if, if that is truly what's holding this back, I mean, but maybe
4523660	4528700	because they can, and I will be only because they can make so many of them and these types
4528700	4533660	of things, maybe it's just not worth it to have somebody go in there and redo things.
4534220	4536860	Bobby Black Wolf says lunar is also the voice acting.
4537420	4542380	Well, Konami tried to find a way around that too with the Silent Hill collection.
4543180	4545260	Didn't go so well for him though, at the end of the day.
4545260	4549100	So that can also be fixed, but fair.
4551020	4554940	But yeah, it's probably, and as Orange Wright says, it's too much effort probably for the
4554940	4559660	minimal amount of release that they're doing with these, you know, again, they're only
4559660	4563740	going to sell what a 10th of what they had published last time, just due to the shortages
4563740	4564380	and all that stuff.
4565020	4570140	I would say, hold out hope, maybe that there'll be a third one of these and then maybe those
4570140	4572860	games will show up if there's the demand for them.
4572860	4575180	But it's interesting.
4575180	4580460	So of course I, I kind of missed those Sega years personally.
4580460	4584220	So to be honest, I've never played lunar, but I've heard a lot of great things about
4584220	4586700	it and I feel like, Oh, clearly I'm missing something there.
4586700	4589100	So, all right.
4589740	4591580	Anyway, let's move on.
4591580	4599100	Let's move on to, let's move on to a simpler time and a retro title that has had no problems
4599100	4602700	getting reported and republished over and over again.
4602700	4604540	We're going to go to the classic game of the week.
4604540	4620540	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4620540	4622780	out a classic and tell you about it.
4622780	4625420	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4626620	4627100	All right.
4627100	4630700	And dark soccer, what classic game did you pick for folks this week?
4631420	4632460	I picked ice climber.
4632460	4641820	Ice climber was a platformer that was developed and published by Nintendo first for the versus
4641820	4645260	system, the arcade versus system in 1984.
4645260	4654780	And then after that for the Famicom and NES in 1985, the characters were Popo and Nana.
4655820	4658300	Although in the German version, they were Pepe and Nana.
4659500	4661420	They were known as the ice climbers.
4661420	4669420	And they had to go through 32 vertically scrolling mountains to recover stolen vegetables
4669420	4670460	from a giant condor.
4671820	4676380	And in some European countries, ice climber was bundled with the NES.
4677820	4684540	The versus ice climber has a little animated title screen and the stage select menu at
4684540	4686780	the start of the game in between levels.
4687420	4694140	16 more mountains, occasional blizzards and wind effects, more enemy characters and bonus
4694140	4695180	multiplayer items.
4695980	4702940	And of course, as we know, Nana and Popo were playable in the Smash Brothers series, starting
4702940	4705260	with Super Smash Brothers Melee on GameCube.
4706860	4711020	And we'll get into other bits of this later.
4711020	4718780	But player one is Popo, player two is Nana wearing a blue and pink parka respectively.
4719900	4727260	They have a mallet to carve out cave openings in the ice above and to hit enemies.
4727900	4740940	And each of the different mountains have different enemies that will appear.
4740940	4744460	And you have a bonus stage for each level.
4744460	4748940	So each mountain is eight layers of ice and then the bonus stage.
4751100	4755180	Some square blocks that have higher detail are indestructible, so you have to take a
4755180	4755740	different path.
4755740	4762940	There's also hatched ice that is sort of a sliding conveyor belt thing for Nana or Popo
4762940	4763500	left or right.
4764140	4767660	And then there's these clouds that you can't break.
4768300	4773500	But anyway, you have to go up the mountain and defeat enemies and keep going.
4775260	4783580	Now, as I said in the arcade version, there were some other differences.
4784780	4792300	You have, once you go through the initial set of 24 mountains, you have another 24 to
4792300	4795660	go through and then Condor is replaced by a giant butterfly.
4796620	4801660	And then after the next eight stages are cleared, you get bonus round and then you pick up the
4801660	4810540	cycle all over again and it keeps a track whether it was claimed by, well, the mountain
4810540	4814460	was claimed by an ice climber or if it's still topi territory.
4816620	4823180	So they get trickier, they get harder, and then after each bonus stage, those scores
4824060	4827740	are tallied and points are awarded for various things.
4828620	4833340	And it does keep track of the high score, although you cannot save it on the NES version.
4838060	4847020	As far as, you know, a few other things going on with this, there were different releases,
4847020	4849660	but I want to go back a little bit into the development history.
4850380	4859500	Ice Climber and NES Open Tournament Golf were directed by Miki Kenji, a long time Nintendo
4859500	4860540	producer.
4860540	4866940	It was also the first game programmed by Morita Kazuaki, and it was, as he says, his warm
4866940	4869980	up before becoming the main programmer on Super Mario Brothers.
4869980	4880700	And he also was credited with central programming for other games in the Super Mario Brothers
4880700	4883420	series, Legend of Zelda series, and Star Fox 64.
4884220	4890140	So Ice Climber was a launch title for the NES in North America and then was re-released
4890140	4891180	with some of the consoles.
4891740	4899980	The PC-8801 version had a more limited color palette and a reworked HUD, versus Ice Climber
4899980	4908220	has been re-released for Famicom Disk, removing the difficulty settings, and then having graphics
4908220	4909900	closer to Ice Climber.
4911820	4917500	It also was released in Arcade Archives for Nintendo Switch, although they removed the
4917500	4918700	B enemy.
4919340	4929260	The NES game is unlockable in Animal Crossing for GameCube, and it can only be officially
4929260	4931740	unlocked via e-reader in North America.
4934860	4944620	And then it was also a gift for players that requested their save data be transferred from
4945580	4952060	the Japanese Dobutsu Nomori to the Dobutsu Nomori Plus Edition.
4954140	4958540	So as far as various systems it has been on, we'll go ahead and start.
4958540	4968460	We have the Arcade Versus, Famicom NES, the NEC PC-8801 published by Hudson Soft, the
4968460	4976460	Famicom Disk System port, the e-reader version, Game Boy Advance, Wii Virtual Console, 3DS
4976460	4981820	Virtual Console, Wii U Virtual Console, Nintendo Switch Online, and Nintendo Switch Arcade
4981820	4982380	Archives.
4984780	4992940	As of April 1st, 1985, it was the eighth most successful table arcade unit according to
4992940	4993980	Japan Machine.
4994700	5006940	And the former president of Finland, Mano Koivisto, was a big fan of Nintendo games,
5006940	5009500	and his son-in-law said that Ice Climber was his favorite.
5011820	5017980	Computer Entertainer said that the American release was addictive for fans of climbing
5017980	5018380	games.
5019020	5029340	As far as its legacy is considered, they are playable characters in the NES, the 2.5D version
5029340	5036540	of the NES Summit level throughout Super Smash Brothers, and they are voiced by Kobayashi
5036540	5050300	Sanai, and then they were removed for 3DS and Wii U because of the difficulty in maintaining
5050300	5051820	parity between the two characters.
5054060	5060060	And then they had themes from Ice Climber appear regularly in the WarioWare series,
5060700	5064220	and Kirby Nightmare in Dream Land and Kirby Air Ride.
5064220	5071020	Kirby gets a freeze ability, and he wears Popo's parka the same way as in Super Smash
5071020	5071420	Brothers.
5072060	5082540	There's Ice Climber in Tetris DS, and then Daigasso Band of Brothers includes the bonus
5082540	5089420	stage music theme, and Ice Climbers appear in Super Mario Maker as unlockable Mystery
5089420	5090780	Mushroom costumes.
5090780	5098700	I love that.
5098700	5103900	Ice Climbers is such a gem, and you know, once again, chat kind of calling out, here
5103900	5106540	we are episode 927 and never done this game.
5106540	5109980	That's the great thing about this segment is that, you know, there's just so many games
5109980	5113980	out there, and we've played a lot more games than we think.
5113980	5119260	You know, it's pretty wild that, you know, yeah, we've done this segment since episode
5119260	5120140	250.
5120140	5124140	So give or take 700, 650, 700 unique games.
5124140	5129100	I think maybe there's been an accidental repetition like twice, or maybe when you did
5129100	5132780	like soundtracks, you kind of repeated some games because you were focusing on the soundtracks,
5132780	5135580	but like honestly, 650 unique games.
5135580	5137580	That's a lot of games.
5137580	5139580	You know, people have played a lot of games over the years.
5139580	5142780	But anyway, Ice Climbers is certainly one that I remember fondly.
5142780	5144460	There are a lot of games in the world.
5144460	5145100	Yes, there are.
5145100	5145340	Yes, there are.
5145340	5146220	People have played them.
5147500	5147980	There are.
5147980	5148380	There are.
5148460	5153900	And there's more made every single day, especially thanks to indies and the whole scene.
5153900	5156060	So we'll never run out of games for this segment.
5156860	5157180	All right.
5158060	5158860	There it is.
5158860	5160700	Ice Climbers, a real classic.
5160700	5165580	And yeah, it's just somebody had referenced in chat how, you know, Ice Climbers kind of
5165580	5171500	comes from that era of like that NES launch cartridge era where all those games kind of
5171500	5175260	ran on a very similar engine and had this kind of a similar look and feel to them.
5175260	5177100	That very, that same font.
5177100	5181020	I think that Nintendo system font that really, you know, kind of ties a lot of those early
5181020	5181740	games together.
5182780	5188460	Just all the menus and everything were kind of similar to very much like arcade ports,
5188460	5191980	probably because they were based off the versus versus.
5191980	5197420	So anyway, but Ice Climbers definitely like for me, like just a gold, even if, yes, it's
5197420	5198700	hard as hell.
5198700	5203660	It's the jumping is impossible to control, but that's what the game is.
5203660	5205580	Who puts conveyor belts on a mountain?
5205580	5208460	I don't know, but that's, you know, that's part of the game's charm.
5208460	5211820	It was so difficult that when you actually got to the top of the mountain, you really
5211820	5213020	did accomplish something.
5213020	5214380	It's like that game's not easy.
5214380	5215420	So all right.
5215420	5221180	Anyway, let's move on and talk about some other news happening in the gaming world quickly
5221180	5222860	here in rapid fire news.
5222860	5223360	Loki.
5224380	5229660	All right, so Sony is going to be, well, a couple of things.
5229660	5232460	First, Death Stranding is coming to Games Pass.
5232460	5236700	So originally that was something that was available on PlayStation.
5236700	5242460	Well, of course, now on PC Game Pass, since it is out in PC, it is going to be available.
5242460	5249740	And so we got a little tweet from Xbox Game Pass PC that shows, you know, special delivery.
5249740	5254380	And yeah, I'm excited to play this on my new PC.
5254380	5256300	I really is.
5256300	5259260	Is it the special edition or is it just the regular one?
5259980	5261340	I don't know.
5261340	5262460	Or it's a special edition.
5263020	5264140	Whatever the PC one was.
5264780	5266380	Oh, which I don't know if they ever released.
5267180	5271580	Yeah, it says despite five or five, also releasing a PC version of the director's cut.
5272540	5279500	The original game is it says the on the Games Pass stuff.
5279500	5284380	It says describes it as the original version of Hideo Kojima is critically claimed and
5284380	5285820	genre defined epic.
5286060	5289580	That's hard to say if it's going to be the director's cut or not, but.
5290540	5294460	I'm just going to assume it's not at this point, but oh, well, I'll still check it out
5294460	5297500	because it'll probably look even better than it did when I played it on PlayStation the
5297500	5298000	first time.
5298540	5299100	Yeah, probably.
5299660	5304700	And then Sony is also going to be developing a Days Gone movie, apparently.
5305580	5315500	So according to Deadline, Sam Hagen is circling the project and screenwriter Sheldon Turner
5315500	5316300	is adapting.
5317900	5321740	So we'll have to see what that's like, I guess.
5321740	5322860	Other zombie movie.
5322860	5327100	No shortage of video game related media lately, right?
5327100	5329660	I keep seeing that Uncharted finally hit Netflix.
5331020	5331980	Oh, yeah, yeah.
5331980	5334700	I haven't got a chance to watch it or if I'm going to.
5335660	5336300	Dark Sakura.
5337820	5342860	So in other news going on, I saw this and I was like, oh, that looks good.
5343180	5351420	Some fans are remaking the first Resident Evil in Unreal Engine 5, and it looks really,
5351420	5352460	really, really good.
5354140	5359180	They're calling it Biohazard RE1 Classic Edition.
5359820	5364380	And it honestly is looking really good.
5364380	5367020	They're hoping to have that out.
5367020	5369420	I'm trying to see when they said.
5370300	5378460	No, I don't have I don't see a date on it, but they seem to like quite a lot for Jill
5378460	5383660	Dunn, like their little trailer has her doing the Moonlight Sonata scene to open the door
5383660	5388540	and her working with Barry and some of her voice lines recorded.
5389340	5391020	So it looks really good.
5391740	5392140	Awesome.
5392140	5395900	And they're also working on doing a non fixed dangle version.
5396540	5398060	Oh, yeah.
5398300	5404460	All right, quickly, in another part of the gaming universe, QuakeCon 2022 happened this
5404460	5405500	last weekend.
5405500	5409820	It was virtual again this year, so it was mostly streaming announcements and things
5409820	5410380	of that sort.
5410380	5416540	However, obviously, with Microsoft having picked up Bethesda some time ago, these QuakeCons
5416540	5418140	end up being a lot of Bethesda announcements.
5418140	5421500	And lately it's about how they're partnering with Microsoft.
5421500	5424780	And again, a lot of Xbox Game Pass releases.
5425020	5429340	Six Bethesda games for Xbox Game Pass PC.
5429340	5433340	Please note this is PC and is not a Series X or anything.
5433340	5439420	But Wolfenstein 3D as in the classic, which I think Jamie, didn't we have that as a classic
5439420	5441660	game, like not even like three months ago or something?
5441660	5442220	It was recent.
5442220	5443100	Yeah, we did.
5443100	5449660	Yeah, so that is now on Game Pass PC, as is the return to Castle Wolfenstein, the reboot
5449660	5450860	they did years later.
5450860	5456060	Quake 4, Quake Champions, that game, I think it was already free to play, but it's like
5456060	5457820	you get all the champions unlocked in that.
5458460	5462780	And then for some reason, even though it's QuakeCon, we got some Elder Scrolls announcements.
5462780	5466620	Battlespire and Redguard are also now on Xbox Game Pass PCs.
5466620	5470940	So it's like some more classic titles, mostly, besides the Quake Champions.
5471740	5473500	Pretty cool that that's all available.
5473500	5478700	I also noticed Doom 64 was on Epic Game Stores, the freebie.
5478700	5482940	So this is not just limited to Xbox Game Pass stuff.
5482940	5486300	There's some other stuff going on around the gaming universe as well.
5486300	5492380	So if no one special 77 is out there somewhere, enjoy all those free games, including Doom
5492380	5494220	64, which is not bad.
5494220	5495980	It's worth checking out for sure.
5495980	5500540	So all right, let's move on with some more stories.
5500540	5503500	Oh, actually, no, we're going to go to some release dates first and check out the games
5503500	5505580	that are coming out this week.
5505580	5509340	Loki, I don't think I need to ask about the big one in the US this week because you already
5509340	5510540	said you were going to stream it.
5510540	5513740	But humor us and recap the releases anyway.
5514380	5520860	The big one this week is Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation
5520860	5523740	4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
5523740	5528540	Is it still that comic that that told all the Rednet jokes that host that?
5528540	5529740	Or did they have to have a...
5530540	5531980	Yes, I literally forgot his name.
5531980	5533980	Was just Jeff Foxworthy.
5533980	5535740	But you know who's hosting it now?
5535740	5536540	No, that's always cool.
5536540	5537260	Who hosts it now?
5537820	5540540	Well, nobody, because you can't see him.
5541340	5542380	But it's John Cena.
5543260	5543900	Is it really?
5544700	5545260	Yeah.
5545260	5546460	Oh, I didn't know that.
5546460	5547100	I don't know.
5547100	5548300	I literally don't know.
5548300	5549020	Or I'm sorry.
5549020	5549420	Yeah.
5549420	5552540	So well, actually, it was revived with John Cena.
5552540	5557340	So he hosted from June 10th through November 2019.
5557340	5559500	I'm not surprised at all that John Cena is hosting a game show.
5559500	5560060	Of course he is.
5560620	5564220	If it's still is it still even on TV?
5564220	5569420	Like I saw like I was like we went to the theaters for something and they had, you know,
5569420	5571980	those advertisements before the show type thing.
5571980	5573500	And I think they were showing that.
5573500	5575340	And I saw John Cena, you know, seemed like what?
5577580	5579660	Yeah, I don't know if it's it's back on again.
5581020	5583260	And honestly, I'm going to be is terrible game show.
5583260	5584700	Like I love game shows.
5584700	5587100	I think that game show is really one of the worst.
5587420	5589740	It's a one trick pony show.
5589740	5592220	And like the gag is old after five minutes.
5592220	5595100	I think it's really one of the worst game shows they've ever made.
5595100	5597180	I think I don't know why he's watching it.
5597180	5598620	Why do you bring it back?
5598620	5600860	But it's it's called something else.
5600860	5604220	And it's not like are you smarter than are you a dumb shit?
5604220	5605420	It's like something.
5605420	5607580	Actually, I don't want to use that word because it's ableist.
5607580	5610540	But like, like, are you?
5610540	5614060	But but that's that's the whole that's the whole gag of the show.
5614060	5615260	I just I just don't care for the show.
5615260	5617420	But anyway, there's other games coming out, right, Loki?
5618540	5618940	Yeah.
5618940	5619260	Yeah.
5619260	5626140	So aside from that, there's going to be Fallen Legion Revenants, which is on PC, PlayStation
5626140	5630060	five, Xbox one, Xbox series, Fallen Legion, Rise of Glory.
5630700	5633020	That is also going to be on the same platforms as well.
5634380	5639420	Midnight Fight Express on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5640060	5645100	Saints Row is going to be out on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one.
5645100	5646140	And Xbox series.
5646780	5647820	God, I hope it doesn't suck.
5648700	5651500	How are you feeling right now on the eve of that game?
5651500	5654700	I am not super excited about it.
5654700	5658300	I am going to play it, but I am not like hyped on it.
5658300	5661180	That's a good place to be, because you know what?
5661180	5666300	It can only exceed your expectations and not be even lower.
5666300	5666700	Yeah, I know.
5669180	5674780	But the chances of it exceeding your expectations are much higher than if you're like,
5675580	5677740	middle ground, you know, you're not like over.
5677740	5680300	Like, I just I'm not super excited about it.
5680300	5685900	It's a better place than where I'm at with Final Fantasy 16, because I know and I'm sitting
5685900	5688140	here going, do not put the bar too high.
5688140	5690220	Do not put the bar at a level that is insurmountable.
5690220	5693420	I can't I can say that on one hand and on the other.
5693420	5698380	I am completely like, but this game, I'm so hyped for it.
5698380	5699660	I cannot wait.
5699660	5701660	There are so many talented people involved.
5701660	5703100	This is going to be the best thing.
5703100	5705100	This will be the best video game that's ever been made.
5706620	5707500	I can't help it.
5707500	5709580	I just the hype machine is in full effect.
5709580	5711260	So yeah, but you're in it.
5711260	5713500	You're in a healthier place for your fandom, Loki.
5714380	5715420	I don't like that.
5715420	5719900	I don't like the characters right now as from an outside looking in without actually playing
5719900	5720940	the game yet.
5720940	5722780	I don't like the way the characters.
5722780	5724780	I don't like the characters themselves.
5724780	5727580	Maybe they'll grow me, you know, and that's perfectly fine.
5727580	5730860	And I would love to be like surprised by that.
5730860	5732780	Maybe there'll be a plot twist about the character.
5733180	5737500	Like the movie Orphan or something, a big revelation that makes the movie 10 times cooler.
5738620	5739180	20 times.
5739180	5746700	By the way, Orphan first cut is now apparently on Paramount Plus and it's just as wild.
5747580	5750860	Like everything I'm here is just as wild.
5750860	5754300	I hope that it shares something in common with a game that's coming out later in the
5754300	5755900	week, which we'll get to in just a second here.
5755900	5756220	OK.
5756220	5759180	And it is pretty buggy.
5759180	5759820	So we'll see.
5760700	5761820	I hope we'll see.
5762860	5769740	Anyways, there's also Yars Recharged, which is coming out on PC, Mac, Linux, Nintendo
5769740	5776780	Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Stadia and Atari VCS.

5797900	5802460	Earth Defense Force 6 on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5804380	5808060	Hack, which is on PC and Nintendo Switch.
5808780	5811660	I was a teenage exocolonist.
5812540	5813500	That's quite a name.
5814620	5818540	On PC, Mac and Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5819260	5822540	Idol Manager on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

5829500	5835580	SD Gundam Battle Alliance on PC and Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
5835580	5837820	One and Xbox Series.
5838540	5841660	Chin Chan, me and the professor on summer vacation.
5841660	5843500	The endless seven day journey.
5844460	5846460	Well, it's not endless if it's only seven days.
5846460	5847420	It doesn't make any sense.
5847900	5851020	That's I guess that's true.
5851660	5853180	That's on PlayStation 4.
5854300	5859820	Soul Hackers 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

5879260	5887180	coming out on again, I don't know, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
5887180	5890140	I'm sure there's something to have different regions there or something.
5891660	5898620	Nexomon plus Nexomon Extinction Complete Collection on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox
5898620	5899120	One.

5915740	5916380	Series.
5916380	5916940	That's it.
5916940	5919820	S.J. 100 Matt in chat noting a lot coming out this week.
5919820	5927020	Yeah, we are in the fourth quarter, that pre-Labor Day kind of pushing out all the third quarter
5927020	5930140	releases and pretty soon the holiday season.
5930140	5932300	So, yeah, it's going to be that time of year.
5932300	5935660	The gaming industry fourth quarter that starts in August and ends in November.
5935660	5936620	You know that one.
5936620	5937120	Yeah.
5937340	5940380	Questbuster says Gamescom also starts this week on the 23rd.
5940380	5941260	It's true.
5941260	5941740	That's right.
5941740	5947580	There's the Jeff Keighley event, which I am pleased to see that they are showcasing Goat
5947580	5948460	Simulator 3.
5948460	5949820	So very interested in that.
5950460	5951420	When is that?
5951420	5952540	Is that Thursday morning?
5952540	5955740	I think because I think we got an email Thursday something.
5956380	5959180	I saw something on Twitter on that.
5959180	5963020	This may surprise you all, but VOG Network is a friend of Jeff Keighley because he always
5963020	5964300	emails us about his events.
5964300	5965100	I don't mind at all.
5965100	5969500	This is the only bummer is most of these events are during the working day and and VOG Network
5969500	5971660	does not pay any of our bills, believe it or not.
5971660	5975660	So I can't do both when the day job is conflicted.
5975660	5980140	So but I'm excited to see what all they do show at the opening night at Gamescom.
5980140	5980700	That'll be fun.
5981580	5985020	Okay, let's quickly try to run through Japan's releases.
5985020	5986860	But they have a lot as well, but I'll try to make it quick.
5986860	5991340	So on the Switch, Disco Elysium, the final cut gets a release officially on the Switch
5991340	5992620	in Japan this week.
5992620	5996780	We also have SD Gundam Battle Alliance gets released in Japan as well this week.
5996780	6000060	Idol Manager, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge.
6000060	6002940	Yeah, I guess that wasn't out in Japan yet on the Switch, but that will be coming this
6002940	6004780	week on August the 25th.
6004780	6009980	Pac-Man World Repack also coming out in Japan as it is in the US this week.
6010060	6015900	And Tetsudon Nippon, Rosentabi Meichi Tetsudon Hen comes out this week as well.
6016620	6022060	We also have a new Pikachu versus Meowth branded controller that's coming out.
6022060	6022700	Cool.
6022700	6025820	If that's something you like to do is collect those various types of controllers.
6025820	6026940	That's everything on the Switch.
6026940	6028940	If you want to look on the PlayStation 5, guess what?
6028940	6033180	If you're a Saints Row fan in Japan, it's also coming out in Japan this week.
6033180	6037740	There's also a Notorious Edition, which is basically the limited edition also coming
6037740	6038700	out in Japan this week.
6039260	6043500	Disco Elysium is also making its way to the PlayStation 5 in Japan this week.
6043500	6048300	And Earth Defense Force 6 also hits Japanese PlayStation 5 this week.
6048300	6049100	But that's not all.
6049900	6057420	SD Gundam Battle Alliance, Soul Hackers 2, Rustler, Sword and Fairy Together Forever,
6058060	6063340	Idol Manager, Pac-Man World Repack, all of that on PlayStation 5 this week.
6063340	6066460	So there's a lot of games on their way.
6066460	6069820	So all right, let's go to Europe.
6069820	6070700	Dark Sakura, please.
6072380	6074620	Actually, not very many things on the list.
6075580	6078140	Saints Row on August 23rd.
6078140	6080140	In fact, most of these are August 23rd.
6080140	6082220	That's on PlayStation and Xbox.
6082220	6084140	Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?
6084140	6085740	On multiple systems.
6086300	6089820	Nintendo Switch OLED Models Splatoon 3 edition.
6090380	6091180	So there's that.
6092140	6097580	Among Us Ejected Edition on PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.
6097580	6103580	And then on the 26th, we have Soul Hackers 2 and Pac-Man World Repack.
6106780	6107340	And that's it.
6109500	6110140	All righty.
6110620	6112860	Is anyone curious about the Pac-Man World Repack?
6112860	6113660	I kind of am.
6113660	6114620	I kind of want to play it.
6114620	6115020	I don't know.
6115900	6117740	After I play all my other Pac-Man games.
6117740	6118380	Yeah, right.
6118380	6121180	I saw that museum game to keep pushing through, too.
6122220	6124380	So is it like a rerelease of the old game?
6124380	6125340	It's a remaster.
6125340	6127340	So they've redone it, basically.
6127340	6128940	So I'm curious about it.
6128940	6131100	Just can't get excited about Pac-Man.
6131980	6132940	I see.
6132940	6134300	They're very hit and miss for me.
6134300	6135500	Some of them are crap.
6135500	6140140	But like Pac-Man Championship Edition and Championship Edition 2 gave that series a
6140140	6141900	swift kick in the butt that it badly needed.
6141900	6142780	They were really good.
6143660	6145740	So like there are good Pac-Man releases still.
6146300	6151740	I think Pac-Man needs to have like the social media person that controls the Sonic the Hedgehog
6151740	6153660	Twitter account to like.
6153660	6156380	No, they need the person that controls the Radio Shack Twitter account.
6157740	6158540	Maybe not that.
6158540	6159580	That's a little bit too much.
6161420	6163260	I want Pac-Man to be edgy.
6164380	6164860	All right.
6164860	6165980	That would be pretty edgy.
6167420	6172700	Let's move on and touch on a few more headlines before we get to listener roundtable and your
6172700	6175500	thoughts and calls and tweets, etc.
6175500	6176380	But first, Loki.
6177740	6182860	I'm sure what I'm going to assume that they're going to describe as another horrible misstep.
6185020	6191660	There's another allegation of Call of Duty stealing other people's artwork again.
6191660	6194540	So we talked about this a while back or not even a while back.
6194540	6198140	I think it was a couple of weeks ago about how they had to pull the skin off of their
6198140	6205260	marketplace because it stole the it basically plagiarized the work of one of the artists
6205260	6206460	out there that created skin.
6206460	6209500	Well, this time they're even being more bold about it.
6209500	6214940	And they are apparently putting out skin that looks awfully similar.
6214940	6222700	Not quite identical this time, but certainly extremely similar to a heavily inspired by
6223580	6225020	heavily inspired by.
6225020	6233660	And this is like by Robert Bolling, or as you may know him, four zero two, who it was
6233660	6241500	an Infinity Ward guy now working with Dr. Disrespect on their new game, Midnight Society.
6241500	6247420	And he actually showed a skin that was going to be in that game.
6247420	6248700	And oh, look at that.
6248700	6252220	Now, all of a sudden, it's coming out for Call of Duty.
6254860	6255980	Yeah, go figure.
6255980	6258540	This is certainly very, very similar.
6260300	6262700	Legally distinct, I think is what they call that, right?
6264140	6265340	All right.
6266140	6266640	Yeah.
6267020	6271980	Well, switching gears completely, Dark Soccer has a sad story for us, but one with the silver
6271980	6272480	lining.
6273420	6273920	Yeah.
6274460	6283900	So an indie developer by the name of Rob Hale has recently died, and he left final wishes
6283900	6294460	that his first published game and its sequel are out for free on Steam.
6295180	6297660	He's also known as Squid in a Box.
6297660	6307100	He died of cancer, and his partner CJ put the announcement out that Waves and the next
6307100	6313660	game that was in development, Waves 2, would be made free to download on Steam.
6314300	6320300	CJ is quoted saying this is something Rob was considering anyway with the past two months
6320300	6324460	as their health entered into more substantial difficulties.
6324460	6328300	I hope this can be seen as a parting gift to all of those out there that haven't yet
6328300	6329740	played either of these games.
6331500	6342620	So both of them are twin-stick shooters, very colorful, very pretty neon lights, and definitely
6342620	6343980	seem like they're a lot of fun.
6343980	6346140	So definitely go check it out.
6346780	6352380	This is a very lovely thing to do to really kind of show the impact that you had on the
6352380	6357100	world through art, because art is something that many of us contribute in different ways.
6357820	6361420	One could argue that this very podcast is in fact art.
6361420	6367180	It's a certain type of art, but it's art, and art is one of those things that we leave
6367180	6368300	behind on this world, right?
6368300	6372780	I call this the found medium, found object medium.
6372780	6375980	So you would say it's found art or fart for short.
6378620	6380700	Well, technically it would be found object medium.
6382060	6387580	But anyway, in all seriousness, and not to laugh at what is otherwise a very serious
6387580	6394220	thing, this is a very lovely thing to really gift the world your art as you move on to
6394220	6397980	the next adventure and really show everyone the mark you left behind.
6398140	6398940	I think that's really cool.
6400220	6402540	And yeah, I'll definitely check the game out.
6402540	6404860	I remember hearing about Waze a while ago.
6404860	6408220	I want to say maybe I even saw it, but I don't think I necessarily played it.
6408220	6409580	So I'll certainly check it out.
6410220	6410780	Good chance.
6412540	6418540	For the record, when I noticed, I mean, both of them are PC games, but Waze 2 actually
6418540	6421260	has Steam Deck compatibility if anyone has one.
6421260	6421760	Neat.
6422700	6424300	All right, let's move on.
6424300	6425500	Loki, just a few more stories.
6426460	6432940	All right, so we always make the joke, you know, what is Doom running on now?
6433580	6437660	So now someone has gotten Doom to run on a farm tractor.
6438620	6443020	So now you can, you know, harvest and play Doom at the same time.
6444460	6445820	And also loop killers.
6447980	6448620	Sorry, Rob.
6448620	6449340	That's for Rob.
6450060	6450620	I get it.
6450620	6451120	I get it.
6451920	6452320	All right.
6452320	6456720	So this was part of this was shown, I guess, at Def Con.
6456720	6463840	And so they're saying, you know, as part of this process, they use the source port dehacked
6463840	6464340	Doom.
6465360	6472080	And then, of course, another modder, Skelligant, was able to create a farm themed Doom mod
6472080	6476080	to be able to play on the John Deere's tractor jailbroken system.
6476080	6476580	Of course.
6477600	6481920	It's less important that the John Deere tractors run Doom.
6481920	6485760	It's more important that they've jailbroken the system because John Deere locks down a
6485760	6491280	lot of these computers and stuff for they're trying to stop right to repair.
6491280	6499040	So that is really the motivation for them to, you know, try to hack the John Deere systems.
6499040	6503040	But of course, you know, if you hack something, you want to show that you can run Doom on
6503040	6504160	it because why not?
6504640	6505280	Orange right.
6505280	6509440	With a very good question in chat saying sooner or later, we'll see Doom running in farm
6509440	6510080	simulator.
6510080	6511440	That would be very meta, right?
6511440	6513520	Have Doom in farming simulator on the tractor.
6514080	6515920	Yeah, that would be I can't wait.
6516960	6517280	All right.
6517280	6522960	Or just have like the marine be on a tractor driving through over, you know, demons in
6522960	6523460	hell.
6524800	6528640	Oh, so basically make it Doom, but farming.
6529600	6531600	No, he's not farming anything.
6531600	6534000	He's just running over people with a tractor or demons.
6535120	6535840	He's far.
6535840	6536880	He's farming kills.
6537680	6538400	Farming kills.
6538400	6538960	Exactly.
6538960	6539680	Farming kills.
6540720	6544880	I farm blood points on a tractor in Dead by Daylight.
6545760	6546480	Womp womp.
6546480	6547520	Womp womp.
6547520	6548020	All right.
6548480	6551680	We have one more announcement tonight.
6551680	6553040	One more story to get into.
6553040	6556480	Do you remember last week we had an announcement of an announcement?
6556480	6559120	It was Sunsoft was set to reveal something.
6559120	6564080	Well, they revealed it, and the game they announced was Iki Unite.
6564080	6570240	It is a revival of a 1985 arcade and Famicom roguelike game for PC.
6570240	6576800	It's going to launch in 2022, but this will support up to 16 players online.
6576800	6581840	And there's a very, very, very short teaser video that's out there, but it is something
6581840	6586720	you can kind of check out to see the game in motion there, which it's interesting because
6586720	6592320	I've heard people say it just looks like they're riding the vampire survivors train.
6592320	6599040	And even though this is a remake or reimagining, if you will, of a game that was made in 1985,
6600160	6606640	yeah, I'm definitely getting the vampire survivors vibe from this game.
6606640	6610800	Yeah, which is, you know, there's a lot of knockoff games for that right now,
6610800	6611840	so I'm not really surprised.
6612480	6613440	And that's a great game.
6613440	6617360	So, yeah, but that was the big Sunsoft reveal was this particular game.
6617360	6621280	So sorry if you were like me and you were waiting for Fester's Quest to come back.
6622000	6624000	Unfortunately, that will not be coming out.
6624000	6626320	However, before I get to listen to Roundtable,
6626320	6629200	does anyone else see that trailer for the Wednesday Netflix series?
6629920	6630160	Yes.
6630880	6632560	I think it looks really good.
6632560	6636320	I think there's a lot of people that are ready to hate on it, but I think it looks good.
6636320	6640320	First off, and I think a lot of people have already addressed this,
6640320	6644080	but I'm just going to say I don't have any problem with Luis Guzman as
6645280	6648000	Gomez, and they made him look more like the comics.
6648000	6648560	It's fine.
6648560	6654400	Yeah, that was the thing is that they thought Raul Julia was too handsome to be a proper Gomez.
6654400	6655440	Which fair.
6656240	6658240	He was a handsome fucking guy.
6658240	6663520	Short and very stout and not all that good looking.
6663520	6668000	Yeah, so but I loved the tone of the trailer.
6668160	6672400	It was that perfect blend of very dry humor.
6673840	6674720	Who did they cast?
6675520	6676720	Jenny Ortega, I think is her name.
6676720	6679600	She was also the girl in the opening scene in the new screen movie.
6679600	6680800	She's having a great year.
6680800	6681360	She's great.
6682240	6685280	She had just that right amount of dryness in that scene and everything.
6685280	6685760	It was good.
6685760	6686560	I enjoyed it.
6686560	6689680	So I don't get excited about it on TV, any show.
6689680	6691920	Yeah, but I'm excited for that one.
6691920	6694000	And some people were saying that it was too much.
6694640	6696240	They shouldn't be making dick jokes.
6696720	6698000	No, they didn't.
6698000	6702480	They listen very carefully to the words they chose and the way they did it.
6703440	6705040	There's a lot there.
6705040	6707680	That's your dirty ass brain filling in the gaps.
6707680	6710720	They did not explicitly say the Piranha was biting him in the dick.
6711680	6713520	So just something to do that.
6714160	6719680	So, um, DJ says, uh, Luis Guzman is too much of an oblong head and his hair looks like
6719680	6720960	a cheap toupee recast.
6720960	6722480	I will say the hair.
6722560	6727120	The hair is the one thing where I'm like, and I could see where people take issue with
6727120	6734080	that, but I, I think it's one of those things where it's like the, the, um, what would
6734080	6734560	you call it?
6734560	6740800	The, um, the, the meter was turned up to 11 in the, um, over the top department with that
6740800	6741680	wig, I think.
6741680	6744480	So, but I, I, I, I'm excited to see the emotion.
6744480	6748560	The other thing to keep in mind, he's actually not a main character in this show.
6750000	6752000	So he's in it, but he's not a main character.
6752480	6754880	So, cause it's, it's a Wednesday spinoff show.
6754880	6758000	So Wednesday's main character, I believe Morticia is for some reason.
6758560	6761200	Um, but yeah, so I'm excited for the show to be honest.
6762080	6762400	Yeah.
6762400	6768400	And I'm putting a link for those who don't know, I'm putting a link in chat of what,
6770320	6772720	what the original comic Gomez looked like.
6772720	6773120	Yeah.
6773120	6774880	And pretty much how perfect.
6775520	6780000	Um, yeah, as I also agree with Sarah when I'm at, apparently they're keeping Fester's
6780000	6781920	casting under really tight lock and key.
6781920	6782960	So it's gotta be big.
6782960	6783200	Yeah.
6783200	6788640	There's been no, nothing on who is playing Fester or if Fester's even in the show, it
6788640	6791040	could be one of those things where he's not showing up to later season.
6791040	6792080	I don't know, but we'll see.
6792880	6794960	What if they got Christopher Lloyd to do it again?
6794960	6795680	That'd be amazing.
6795680	6799840	Christopher Lloyd though has like lost a lot of weight.
6799840	6800560	Oh yeah.
6800560	6801840	He, and he is in his late eighties.
6802480	6804160	He's, he's fairly up there.
6804160	6804660	Yeah.
6806000	6807680	Even just for a scene, just for a scene.
6807680	6808180	All right.
6809140	6812580	Uh, let's get into, although, you know, who is in it.
6812580	6814980	I will say who is in it is Christina Ricci's in it.
6814980	6816580	And they're not saying who she's playing.
6817460	6817780	Now.
6817780	6824740	I don't know if she's that, that, that would be a hoot if she's uncle Fester, but I don't
6824740	6825380	think so either.
6825380	6826500	I don't see how that works.
6826500	6828340	I think she'd be like a teacher or something.
6828340	6832900	I think, I think, I think she goes the complete off opposite and she's like the harmony hut
6832900	6834580	lady in this, uh, this one.
6834580	6835620	So we'll see what happens.
6836500	6836820	All right.
6836820	6838740	Anyway, let's get to the listener round table.
6838740	6843060	We will take on any questions that you might have as well as your tweets and your emails
6843060	6847460	over at, uh, participate at orange lounge radio.com.
6847460	6850900	I think I saw at least one, uh, uh, for reading tonight.
6850900	6851620	So let's get to it.
6851620	6852660	Uh, our email tonight.
6854020	6856420	Um, this comes from Ziva.
6856420	6856740	Yay.
6856740	6863860	A free com, a free company in final fantasy 14 called, uh, Cirque is doing a production
6863860	6865780	of clue on August 27th.
6866340	6871380	It starts at 9 PM EST on the Matias server, which is on the crystal data center.
6872740	6877540	They perform all of their productions inside their free company house that is located in
6877540	6881220	the lavender beds residential zone in ward 10 house three.
6881940	6887460	Since data center travel is now a thing, and I know there might be a handful of people
6887460	6888420	interested in this.
6888420	6890900	I thought I would email about it.
6890900	6893060	I also posted this on the discord.
6893060	6897620	Some of Cirque's past productions were beauty and the beast, Rocky horror picture show,
6897620	6901940	little mermaid, labyrinth, the room, princess bride, and street fighter.
6901940	6905860	Every single one of their performances are well scripted and choreographed.
6905860	6911140	They have the players who obviously act out the parts players who are in charge of the
6911140	6917060	lighting and effects, and they give out watch together link, which has the music, um, arrive
6917060	6918500	early because it fills up quickly.
6918900	6924020	If you don't play final fantasy 14, but are interested in seeing this in game, you can
6924020	6929620	create a free trial account on Matias and choose Gridania as your starting town.
6929620	6935140	Then you can get to the lavender beds residential zone by talking to a central shroud skipper
6935140	6937380	NPC outside of Gridania.
6938260	6943380	You can also pick up a level 10 quest at bench brand in central shroud.
6943380	6948260	Once complete, you can work to lavender beds using the main grid on yet either right at
6948260	6948980	no charge.
6949540	6954740	If you don't want to make an account and still are interested in seeing the, uh, the production,
6954740	6956660	there's usually a live stream.
6956660	6961620	If anyone has any questions, feel free to send me a DM on discord.
6961620	6963540	Hope to see some of you there.
6963540	6964420	And that's from Ziba.
6965860	6967300	Oh, TD alcoholics and chat.
6967300	6967800	Hi.
6968900	6970580	Um, thank you Ziba for that.
6970580	6973140	And yeah, Ziba tweeted that at me and you know, I was like, oh, I
6973140	6974020	definitely want to come.
6974020	6977460	The only bummer is I just found out, well, it's not a bummer for me, but it's a bummer
6977460	6977780	for this.
6977780	6981220	I just found out that my friend from San Diego is going to be here visiting that same day.
6981220	6982980	So I'm not sure I can actually go live.
6982980	6984740	So I really hope it's on YouTube.
6984740	6991220	I'm really curious if it's the movie or the play because it sounds like they've done plays
6991220	6991780	in there.
6991780	6994260	And most people know clue through the movie.
6994900	6997780	Specifically said Rocky horror picture show is done.
6997780	6998980	Not the Rocky horror show.
6998980	6999780	Oh, good catch.
6999780	7000180	Good catch.
7000180	7002100	So they're basically redoing movies in there.
7002100	7002420	Okay.
7002420	7002900	Interesting.
7003220	7008580	Um, yeah, because there was a separate clue Broadway play about 10 years or off-Broadway
7008580	7009780	or one of those about 10 years ago.
7009780	7010260	So, okay.
7010260	7011860	So they're doing the movie.
7011860	7016340	Well, I'm curious because you don't see movies staged a lot.
7016340	7021380	Although ironically, I did see a stage production of clue the movie.
7021380	7023140	They were kind of doing it under the radar.
7023140	7024340	I saw it in San Francisco.
7024980	7026500	This is the same theater company.
7026500	7031940	Like six months later, they did star Wars and they got shut down in a heartbeat.
7032340	7036420	Some, unfortunately they're a little too close to Lucasfilm store being in San Francisco
7036420	7037860	and they got shut down for doing star Wars.
7037860	7042260	But I wa I saw them do clue like six months prior and it was a lot of fun.
7042260	7045140	So that is the first time I saw Mrs.
7045140	7046820	Peacock played by a man.
7046820	7048340	And I thought it was great.
7048340	7050900	And I, I swore one day I would play Mrs.
7050900	7052340	Peacock and I did.
7052340	7055140	So that was, that was because of that performance.
7055140	7056180	I had a great time with that.
7056180	7059460	So, uh, but yeah, I'm, I'm excited to check it out.
7059460	7061460	I really, really, really hope they archive it on YouTube.
7061460	7065220	If I can't be there live, because I might, I might, because the East coast time difference,
7065220	7067060	I might be able to be there for at least a little bit.
7067060	7069220	So I'll be curious, but it sounds great.
7070420	7071940	So completely off topic.
7071940	7072180	Yeah.
7072820	7076500	I'm sad that you're not watching celebrity drag race because then we would have something
7076500	7077940	to talk about if no one emails.
7079540	7084900	No, I just, I, I, I have to be careful how much dry grace I consume or I get sick of
7084900	7084980	it.
7084980	7088020	Like that's why I don't bother with any of the international versions anymore.
7088020	7089300	I don't watch any of them.
7090260	7091380	Although I'm pretty good.
7091380	7097220	I heard drag race Philippines is like next level drama.
7097220	7098900	Like it's apparently really good.
7098900	7103940	And it's the only non U S edition to have an untucked.
7103940	7105460	And for good reason, apparently.
7107940	7110580	So I saw some clips floating around Twitter.
7110580	7111220	It looked great.
7112020	7115060	So anyway, it's great to see DDR alcoholic.
7115060	7116260	Hey, heads up.
7116580	7117300	So, so do your call.
7117300	7120340	Like the reason why we're all a fanning and fawning is because that's somebody we used
7120340	7125300	to play DDR with back in the day, uh, over at Roseville, in the years that this show
7125300	7125940	was formed.
7125940	7126260	Right.
7127060	7128420	I would be curious.
7128420	7129540	Well, I guess did your call.
7129540	7131860	It kind of lives a little ways away now from what I remember.
7131860	7136340	So she's not around the corner anymore, but I'd be curious if you ever made your way up
7136340	7141140	to round one now that it's open in Roseville, I guess that's quite a distance, but it's
7141140	7142180	worth asking.
7142180	7147940	Cause just, just to, just to see, just to see how it's evolved and the kids today playing
7147940	7149060	the same games.
7149060	7151700	So I'd be curious.
7152900	7153220	All right.
7153860	7158420	Let's get to some tweets at least over at twitter.com slash O L R because I know there
7158420	7163780	was at least, I want to give a shout out to SSJ 100, Matt, who number one was the only
7163780	7169700	person who actually tweeted us a picture of their O L R setup, complete with cameo doggy
7169700	7170100	there.
7170100	7170980	So enjoy that.
7171540	7172100	That was great.
7172100	7173220	I retweeted that as well.
7173220	7174980	So, oh, actually, no, I didn't.
7174980	7176820	Cause it's a locked account so I can only reply.
7177620	7181300	So I guess I just showed somebody's private tweet, but I have a feeling he won't mind.
7181300	7181620	All right.
7183140	7183780	Let's see.
7183780	7191300	Then number two for SSJ 100, Matt, I completely stole a meme he put in our discord and I passed
7191300	7192100	it off as our own.
7192100	7193220	Did you see that one Loki?
7193220	7197220	Because he, he did the meme of the, the, I don't know, it looked like the girl yelling
7197220	7201860	at the guy at the festival or whatever with the whole little like written message in all
7201860	7202580	caps.
7202580	7207780	Then the written message says, so then Loki said that if this weird card game sold 1 million
7207780	7210820	copies, he would wear a costume of this character called Tingle.
7210820	7211940	And there's a whole thing on that.
7211940	7212820	I thought it was funny.
7213460	7216180	That's, that's why I stole it and made it, made it our own.
7216180	7220100	So thank you, SSJ 100, Matt, for letting me steal that without suing.
7221300	7226980	Now, something else that got tweeted over to us, Dark Tetsuya actually tweeted us saying,
7226980	7228340	I thought this was cool.
7228340	7233060	Um, a recently preserved prototype version of NES NARC.
7233060	7235460	You remember that game from the early nineties?
7235460	7236900	I remember the arcade version.
7236900	7237140	Yes.
7237140	7237940	There was an arcade.
7237940	7240260	It also had a cameo in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
7240260	7242100	And I think, wasn't there a Super Nintendo version?
7242900	7243540	Yeah, I think.
7243540	7244040	Yeah.
7244500	7250100	But there was supposed to be an NES version before Nintendo's sensors stepped in.
7250100	7254020	So, uh, embedded a tweet from the account Forest Illusion.
7254260	7259380	We preserved a prototype of NARC for the Nintendo Entertainment System developed by Rare Limited.
7259380	7263780	According to the front label, this build was intended for demo purposes at CES.
7263780	7268900	As for the build itself, it's uncensored and features various references to smoking
7268900	7270500	and illicit drugs.
7270500	7274100	And now that it's on the internet, of course, anybody can check it out there.
7274100	7275780	It's available to check out.
7275780	7279620	You can see a whole thing on YouTube and they have some screenshots as well of what like
7279620	7282340	the game looked like and so forth on the NES.
7282340	7283700	So, uh, pretty cool.
7284900	7290260	Fifth dream in chats is I played NARC so much in the Walmart lobby when I was a kid.
7290900	7291140	Yeah.
7292980	7294820	That says a lot about the nineties right there.
7296020	7297300	But thank you for that tweet.
7297300	7299060	That was everything we got on Twitter this week.
7299620	7303860	Uh, I have to say I talked about NARC being in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
7303860	7305300	I was referring to the first movie.
7305300	7305540	Oh yeah.
7305540	7305860	The movie.
7305860	7306420	Yeah.
7306420	7307620	The one from the nineties.
7308740	7309140	Yeah.
7309140	7309380	So.
7310980	7312500	The only movie TV.
7312500	7316260	No, there were, there were, there were, I liked, I liked the third one.
7316260	7316420	Yeah.
7316420	7317860	I liked the third one too.
7317860	7319700	I didn't even hate the second one.
7321620	7325540	My friend and I watched that third one at least like 20 times.
7325540	7331300	So I could quote the whole entire first movie with my friend Courtney.
7332180	7338420	And we would do it when one of our friends at our little group at our lunch table would
7338420	7341460	speak very loudly with her mouth full of food.
7342900	7344260	I love it.
7345220	7345700	All right.
7345700	7347540	I don't think I ever watched the third one.
7347540	7349380	I was just the first and second one.
7349380	7350420	They go back to ancient.
7350420	7350980	Interesting.
7350980	7352340	The third one is the time machine.
7352340	7353860	They go back to ancient Japan.
7353860	7354100	Yeah.
7354100	7354900	That sounds stupid.
7356660	7357140	Not bad.
7357140	7358340	It had some fun stuff in it.
7358340	7362020	It is, but in that awesome nineties kind of way.
7363220	7364580	I don't know how else to explain it.
7367460	7371860	Do you remember the karate kid part two, which involved him going to Okinawa?
7373380	7375460	That movie was fucking good.
7375460	7380900	Like, you know, sometimes that whole, you know, uh, in a new pond type of situation
7380900	7381860	works out very well.
7382740	7387700	There though, a lot of people will say that in some cases, sequels are either utter trash
7387700	7388980	or they're the best of the series.
7388980	7391220	I know a lot of people prefer empire strikes back.
7391220	7392980	I am a Jedi return to the Jedi person.
7393940	7400820	There are people, you know, who say that every, you know, even numbered, um, uh, star Trek
7400820	7404020	movie is good, you know?
7404820	7408020	So now I'm thinking about karate kid part two.
7408020	7409700	You remember that scene with the drums?
7409700	7412020	That was, Oh, chills, chills.
7412020	7412500	So good.
7413060	7414500	I saw that in the theater, Rob.
7414500	7414820	Yeah.
7414820	7416660	I think I saw that one in the theater too.
7416660	7417860	I remember it was really scary.
7419860	7425460	The power, uh, the, the, the glory of love on 45.
7427620	7428260	I love it.
7429060	7432180	Do you kids, you know what a 45 is?
7432180	7433540	It's a tiny record.
7433540	7438100	And it usually had one song on both sides, which is where the term B side comes from.
7438820	7443300	That's why your record player had a switch to go from 33 to 45.
7443300	7444420	So this is funny.
7445300	7450980	Um, tiger is not just to play the songs in a weird, you know, no, it's not.
7450980	7453460	Um, what was I going to say about karate kid?
7453460	7454820	There was a third movie.
7454820	7456900	I completely can't remember it.
7457460	7460420	Like it was back in LA and I do not remember the plot whatsoever.
7460420	7463060	And no, I have not seen Cobra Kai or any of the followups.
7463060	7468500	Like it's really just about the very, I did see next karate kid, not, not the Will Smith
7468500	7471220	kid, uh, yeah, Hillary Swank.
7471220	7471540	I did.
7471540	7476420	I re I saw that one at the 99 cent theater and we're going to leave it at that.
7478340	7484740	Um, tiger class says, I just thought it was silly that they had to make, um, Pat Morita
7484740	7485940	dude, the fake accent.
7486500	7487000	Yeah.
7487540	7491940	Um, tiger con chat says, speaking of the karate kid, you heard the creators of Cobra
7491940	7494580	Kai are going to do a spinoff of Ferris Bueller's day off.
7494580	7494980	I did.
7494980	7499620	I think I saw you or someone post that in our discord, but it's, it's odd.
7499620	7500020	Okay.
7500020	7504260	So do you remember in Ferris Bueller's day off when he goes to take the car to valet
7504260	7507380	parking, that the valets go and they take it on a joy ride.
7508020	7512020	And like, there's that one scene of them going over the Hill and that whole thing that,
7512020	7513140	that is the spinoff.
7513140	7516580	They're making a movie about the valet guys going on a joy ride.
7517460	7518820	That's stupid, right?
7518820	7522180	It's like all of all the spinoffs you can make.
7522180	7523540	That's what you're making.
7523540	7524040	Okay.
7524900	7530900	I mean, I guess all the other actors are too old now and you could probably replace those
7530900	7534660	actors and not many people would notice, but that's interesting.
7534660	7537300	Then why even bring Ferris Bueller's day off into it?
7537300	7541620	Like just, I think Matthew Broderick is a producer on it or something.
7542420	7548020	I think it's just, it could be like, I want to make trashy ideas.
7548020	7552180	Why don't we make a movie about all the baby Godzillas from Godzilla USA?
7552180	7556500	I will wait for at least a trailer, but it just like in principle, it's just kind of
7556500	7557220	like, huh?
7558020	7560420	Do you know, do you know who needs a spinoff movie?
7560420	7563220	You know, who needs to spin off Edie McClurg.
7563220	7566900	And I don't know if you've apparently she's not doing too well.
7566900	7568340	Um, I mean, bless her heart.
7568420	7572580	She's, you know, she was a theater queen in the eighties and you know, now it's 40 years
7572580	7572820	later.
7572820	7574260	So she's up there in age.
7574260	7579700	And apparently, um, apparently there's some elder care issues going on there that don't
7579700	7580340	sound great.
7580340	7585460	And it just, my heart breaks because she is such an icon of the eighties, Edie McClurg.
7585460	7589940	If you don't know who Edie McClurg is, Ferris Bueller's day off, she was the secretary
7589940	7592180	in that movie with those iconic lines.
7592740	7598020	And she was also in that, um, uh, with the Steve Martin, she's the one that Steve Martin
7598020	7600500	rants out in planes, trains, and automobiles.
7600500	7602900	Like, you know, basically like, fuck you lady type of thing.
7602900	7605140	And she just completely fucks him over.
7605140	7607300	Like she, it's an iconic piece of cinema.
7607860	7608100	Yep.
7608100	7610020	DJ Ramesh says Small Wonder.
7610020	7610820	Absolutely.
7610820	7612820	She was the nosy neighbor in Small Wonder.
7612820	7613860	The Hogan family.
7613860	7615220	She was famous on that as well.
7615220	7620900	And, and Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.
7620900	7624100	She was the one and only Chastity Pariah.
7624100	7625060	Thank you very much.
7625060	7629380	If you've never seen Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, fix it.
7629380	7632580	An iconic, iconic piece of cinema.
7635620	7640260	You won't understand my sexuality unless you watch Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.
7640260	7641860	I don't know how else to say it.
7641860	7648660	No, I have one more thing to say.
7650100	7653220	RuPaul was not the first famous drag queen.
7653780	7656500	RuPaul was not the first famous drag queen.
7657060	7660820	Elvira predates RuPaul.
7660820	7666260	Cassandra Peterson, better known as Elvira, 100% a drag queen.
7666260	7667540	100%.
7667540	7672260	That was a drag performance all of those years and continuing now.
7672900	7674660	And the best.
7676100	7677220	Where's her reality show?
7677220	7678500	Actually, she had a reality show.
7678500	7680180	They tried, they did like a next Elvira.
7680180	7681060	It wasn't, it wasn't good.
7681060	7681780	It was low budget.
7681780	7682420	It was not good.
7682420	7683300	No, that's too bad.
7685380	7685780	All right.
7685780	7691220	Anyway, I don't see any calls coming into the green room over at vognetwork.com slash
7691220	7691780	Discord.
7691780	7692900	The purple room.
7692900	7694740	But I will ask quickly.
7694740	7697220	TigerClaw says they should do a new Elvira movie.
7697220	7702340	They did one later, Elvira's Haunted Hills, because Richard O'Brien, famous from the
7702340	7704020	Rocky Horror Picture Show is also in that.
7704740	7707220	It's not, not really as iconic.
7707220	7710740	It's one of those things, you know, it has a few gags, but it's one of those things
7710740	7714660	where it's like you just keep waiting for the, it just doesn't live up to the 80s one.
7716020	7721540	I thought I had heard they were going to do one more, but she's, she doesn't like to
7721540	7722980	do the character so much anymore.
7723060	7724900	You know, she's getting up there in age.
7724900	7729540	She doesn't like to, you know, get all put up together for that anymore.
7729540	7731700	I don't think she, she loves doing it.
7731700	7735140	So she, if you, if you want her to do it, you got to pay her a lot of money.
7735940	7739940	By the way, as a new Elvira pinball table has been in my house.
7739940	7740420	Yeah.
7740420	7742580	Yes, they very much know that it exists.
7742580	7742900	Yeah.
7742900	7743220	Yeah.
7743220	7747060	It's a lovely, lovely piece of technology.
7748420	7750260	All right, let's move on.
7750660	7753620	Uh, I was going to ask any final, uh, stories tonight.
7753620	7754420	Last minute stories.
7754420	7754920	Loki.
7755380	7765220	Uh, I was going to say that this week, um, there there's been some teasing at 2k on
7765220	7770980	Twitter saying, uh, you know, they're celebrating the 15th anniversary of bio shock.
7772340	7776260	Could we be in for a bio shock announcement at gamescom?
7776260	7778500	Maybe, maybe, maybe.
7779060	7782100	Um, how about seven 2k games?
7782100	7782900	How about seven?
7784660	7785620	I'm not sure about that.
7785620	7786260	Well, it's about it.
7786260	7788100	No, it's about time for civilization seven.
7788100	7789300	I'd be down for that.
7789300	7796580	There was a, uh, there was kind of a highlight reel that was done by HBO, uh, for HBO now.
7796580	7798020	And they deleted it.
7799860	7800820	It's deleted.
7800820	7803220	It's a joke because of HBO max and everything going on.
7803220	7803720	Yeah.
7804040	7809160	Yeah, well, yeah, for HBO max, uh, showing off, uh, some of the uncharted series.
7809960	7814920	So, or not uncharted last of us getting all the Sony properties mixed up today.
7814920	7815420	Yeah.
7816600	7818040	The last of us TV series.
7818040	7818920	Watch it while you can.
7819960	7824440	Look to me, they'll, they'll, they'll banish it just like they did Sesame street.
7826120	7827960	Who gets rid of Sesame street?
7827960	7828680	Who does that?
7828680	7831880	People that think the Sesame street can't make them money is why.
7832360	7836200	People that only look at dollar signs and not, you know, Goodwill.
7836760	7842200	This episode was brought to you by the letters F and U and the word discovery.
7844520	7848280	Anyway, uh, any other last minute stories to share with us?
7849320	7850760	Well, that's pretty much it.
7852520	7853000	All right.
7853000	7856280	Well, uh, I think we will, sorry.
7856280	7860520	As the show, one hundred mat says clown show and pod culture says that's an insult to clowns.
7860520	7861020	Yes.
7862680	7863800	All right.
7864440	7866360	Uh, let's wrap it up.
7866360	7868040	Uh, that is going to be it.
7868040	7869720	Uh, let's get to our final thoughts.
7869720	7872280	Thank you as always for listening to orange on radio.
7872280	7875800	If you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend about the show, uh, help us, uh, spread
7875800	7878680	the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices
7878680	7879640	to put out on the air.
7879640	7884280	So, uh, tell a friend or five, uh, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, uh,
7884280	7885320	goes an awful long way.
7885320	7888680	Spotify, wherever it is you listen to this show, uh, spread the word.
7888680	7889080	Sorry.
7889080	7891640	It's not video game news, but something did come up.
7891640	7892140	Okay.
7892520	7896760	Cole of the cats, Cole and marmalade has passed away.
7896760	7897260	Oh.
7900120	7901800	Anyway, I didn't mean to bring it all down.
7901800	7903560	Yeah, way to ruin the mood.
7904440	7908920	No, a lot of people follow Cole and marmalade and I just thought I would say something.
7909720	7910200	All right.
7910200	7912760	Uh, well, you're gonna, here's your chance to make it better.
7912760	7915400	Dark Sakura, leave us with a happier final thought tonight.
7916440	7921000	Um, uh, I'm gonna play some dead by daylight.
7921880	7922380	Have fun.
7923640	7924440	Enjoy the stabbing.
7925240	7925960	Later taters.
7925960	7926460	Bye.
7926840	7927340	Bye.
7927960	7929720	Loki will go to you with your final thought tonight.
7930840	7934280	I can't wait to stream my disappointment of the new saints road game.
7934280	7938600	Well, hopefully I'll be disappointed, but not a lot of people seem positive about it.
7938600	7942360	There's been some gameplay footage that's come out and people aren't happy.
7944360	7950840	And my final, my final thought tonight is, um, I, I am really excited for dragon con.
7950920	7952040	I want to play that game.
7952040	7953480	That's, uh, behind you tonight.
7953480	7953880	Loki.
7953880	7958520	It's on my list of things to pick up this week is that I may stream that too, but that
7958520	7959560	looks really fun.
7959560	7961560	You should get on the streaming bandwagon.
7961560	7962280	It's fun.
7962280	7962920	All right.
7962920	7964040	Uh, that's going to do it.
7964040	7967560	Thank you so much for, uh, uh, tuning in for another episode of orange launch radio.
7967560	7969000	Oh, look, I got to get your final thought.
7970200	7970840	Oh no, I did.
7970840	7971160	You did.
